    "this is an effective tool for understanding meso - scale networks that display nonlinear dynamics , and for defining perturbations of state trajectories to force a system to transition from one basin to another @xcite .",
    "a principal challenge of this approach is that analytical solutions explaining mechanisms of network control remain sparse .",

    "the principal challenge of this approach is that graph statistics themselves do not constitute mechanisms in a philosophical @xcite or mathematical sense @xcite .    a promising paradigm that meets these challenges is linear network control theory @xcite , which assumes that the dynamics of a system are state - dependent , and that they are linear with respect to the state .",

    "for each permutation , we calculated @xmath117 and @xmath118 for every non - driver . then , we averaged @xmath117 and @xmath118 for each non - driver across all permutations , giving us an averaged magnitude @xmath117 and @xmath118 for each brain region in the drosophila , mouse , and each of 10 humans . finally , we plotted the averaged @xmath118 vs @xmath117 for all brain regions in the drosophila , mouse , and the average across all 10 human subjects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_ang]a  c ) .",
    "we find little relationship between the averaged @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the drosophila ( spearman @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) , a moderate negative relationship in the mouse ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , and a strong negative relationship in the human ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) .    to graphically demonstrate how this negative @xmath118 vs. @xmath117 relation might arise in networks , we show a simple 5 node network with two communities of 3 and 2 strongly interconnected sets of nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_ang]d ) .",
    "we first look at the average @xmath117 and @xmath118 between a specific node in the 3 strongly interconnected set ( non - driver 1 , colored light blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_ang]e ) and all four permutations of one other non - driver ( designated non - driver 2 ) as shown in fig .  [ fig : mag_ang]e .",
    "we see that , because non - driver 1 is a member of 3 strongly interconnected nodes , it has on average 1.5 strong driver @xmath0 non - driver edges across the 4 permutations , and 2/4 configurations where it and non - driver 2 are similarly connected ( small angle ) .",
    "in contrast , we look at a specific node in the 2 strongly interconnected set ( non - driver 1 , colored light blue in fig .  [",
    "fig : mag_ang]f ) , and all four permutations of one other non - driver ( non - driver 2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_ang]f ) . here , we find that non - driver 1 only has an average of 0.75 strong driver @xmath0 non - driver connections , and only 1/4 similarly connected configurations .",
    "hence , on average , a non - driver among 3 strongly interconnected nodes will have stronger driver @xmath0 non - driver connections ( larger @xmath117 ) and greater number of similarly connected configurations ( smaller @xmath118 ) than a non - driver among 2 strongly interconnected nodes .      in the previous section , we segregated the energy contribution of network topology into two key components ( magnitude and angle ) , and found that brain networks of more complex species were organized in more energetically favorable ways . here , we look to extend this concept to network modifications that lead to lower control energies .",
    "we focus on the effects of edge deletion since it is often useful in the study of biological systems such as brain @xcite , metabolic @xcite , and gene regulatory @xcite networks .",
    "perhaps counter - intuitively , we show that the deletion of certain edges improves the general controllability of the network .",
    "ultimately , we seek to understand if , and to what degree , edge lesioning may be used therapeutically to improve a network s control profile . to that end",
    ", we quantified the effect of modifying each edge weight on the determinant , deleted edges that maximally increased the determinant , and demonstrated the corresponding impact on the total control energy .",
    "first , we let @xmath125 be as in eq .   and derived ( lemma  [ lemma : gram derivative l ] ) that @xmath126 which characterized the rate of change of the determinant of @xmath72 with respect to a change in any particular edge weight in @xmath55 .",
    "this metric was of particular utility in assessing the sensitivity of the control energy with respect to changes of the network s edge weights .    , @xmath33 , and random final states @xmath52 .",
    "non - drivers were randomly selected for a non - driver fraction of 0.2 in the drosophila , mouse , and human connectomes for 1 deletion , ( * b * ) 2 deletions , ( * c * ) 3 deletions , and ( * d * ) 4 deletions . ]    then , we used eq .   to make informed modifications to the network topology to increase or decrease the network control energy .",
    "first , we randomly selected 10,000 permutations of non - drivers at a non - driver fraction of 0.2 , and designated the remaining regions as drivers . for each permutation",
    ", we extracted the block matrix @xmath55 , calculated @xmath127 , and found the element @xmath128 yielding the largest change based on eq .  .",
    "we then simulated an edge deletion by setting @xmath129 , and we repeated the process to obtain networks of 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 deleted edges .",
    "finally , for each permutation , we performed a random control task on the non - simplified network with initial states @xmath34 , @xmath130 , and final states @xmath52 , and calculated the percent change in minimum energy between the pre- and post - modified networks for drosophila , mouse , and human connectomes fig .",
    "[ fig : weights_remove]a  d . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : weights_remove]a , the removal of a single weight can sometimes lead to more than a 50% reduction in control energy , while the removal of four edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weights_remove]d ) can sometimes lead to more than an 80% reduction in control energy .",
    "we also note that the human connectome , which we showed was already energetically favorable wired , also had the smallest percent decrease in energy from edge - deletion .    here",
    "we use the scaling property of the determinant to make small , strategic topological changes that drastically reduce the control energy .",
    "we show that the deletion of one edge can yield as much as a 50% reduction in energy .",
    "we also show that , for the same topological modification , the drosophila experienced greater energy reduction than the mouse , which also experienced greater energy reduction than the human .",
    "this corresponds to the previous finding where , because brain networks of increasingly complex species are already energetically favorably wired , they may not experience as much improvement after modification .",
    "we emphasize that this was a purely topologically - motivated modification that did not cater to the specific end - state of the control task .",
    "this analysis may also yield a measure of how fragile or robust a specific network is to topological disruption , and introduces the perspective of targeted improvements in network controllability through topological changes .",
    "the control of networked systems is a critical frontier in science , mathematics , and engineering , as it requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that drive network dynamics and subsequently offers the knowledge necessary to intervene in real - world systems to enhance or better their outcomes @xcite . while some theoretical predictions are beginning to be made in nonlinear network systems @xcite ,",
    "the overwhelming majority of recent advances have been made in the context of linear control @xcite . yet , despite the significant efforts , some very basic intuitions regarding how edge weights impact control  either locally around a certain node or globally throughout the whole system  have remained elusive . here , we sought to address this gap by segregating network nodes into either drivers or non - drivers , and examining the dynamic interactions between them .",
    "we show that for a wide range of parameters , the minimum energy required to control a network is mostly a function of these directed bipartite connections , offering a fundamental theory of driver@xmath0non - driver interactions .",
    "we apply this framework to the inter - areal connectomes of the mouse @xcite , drosophila @xcite , and human to demonstrate that the predictions of the theory derived from the bipartite subgraph hold for the fully weighted , directed network .",
    "the work thus offers important insights into network analysis and design by delineating key topological principles in under - actuated network systems .",
    "more specifically , we presented an equivalent first - order energy expression segregating the control energy into task - based and topology - based terms .",
    "we built upon our finding that similarly connected non - driver nodes decrease the gram determinant and increase the control energy by quantifying the connection similarity between non - driver @xmath3 and non - drivers @xmath131 in this topology term .",
    "then we selected non - drivers with the topological goal of minimizing or maximizing this similarity , and showed that on average , networks with non - drivers that minimized this similarity required 2.5  4 orders of magnitude less energy than those that maximized this similarity .",
    "we also showed that the connectomes of increasingly complex species were topologically organized to be energetically favorable .",
    "ultimately , we have shown that there is an inherent topological contribution to the total control energy , which can be used to inform and analyze the selection of drivers and non - drivers .",
    "we concluded by using these principles to show that the deletion of one edge in many thousands of potential edges can yield as much as a 50% reduction in energy , providing insights into how to target improvements in network controllability through fine - scale changes in topology .",
    "a distinct advantage of our approach is the focus on a physically meaningful topological understanding of the principles governing network control .",
    "although spectral analysis of a network s controllability gramian @xcite yields theoretically useful information about the overall behavior of the network under control @xcite , it is not obvious how specific patterns of connectivity or selections of driver and non - driver nodes contribute to this behavior . understanding this relationship is crucial when analyzing empirical biological networks such as the brain compared to purely mathematical networks , because the nodes and edges of a brain network often have known functions and perform known computations @xcite , and we are interested in understanding how these functions and computations modulate or influence one other",
    "we address this gap in understanding between the control behavior and topology of networks through a simplified network only involving connections from driver to non - driver nodes .",
    "this simplification is quite generally motivated by recent work demonstrating that relatively sparse network representations of complex biological systems @xcite can contain much of the information needed to understand the system s structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the simplification hard - codes the fact that energy can be transmitted directly from drivers to non - drivers along walks of length unity . by simplifying the complex network structure into driver @xmath0 non - driver interactions",
    ", we reached a powerful closed - form bilinear mathematical approximation relating a network s topology to the total control energy .",
    "we found that for a range of matrix scales and fractions of non - driver nodes , this simplification well approximates the minimum control energy of the unsimplified network .",
    "this implies that control dynamics along the first - order connections from driver @xmath0 non - driver nodes dominate the dynamics along other connections within the viable range of parameters .",
    "these results inform our understanding of how much first - order connections contribute to the overall dynamics of generic network control systems @xcite .",
    "we used this approach to demonstrate that the similarity and strength of connections from driver to non - driver nodes are key topological principles that govern controllability . to reach this conclusion",
    ", we posited a geometric perspective of network control by showing that the control energy was inversely proportional to the determinant of the gram matrix @xmath67 , and that this determinant was equal to the squared volume of the parallelotope formed by the vector of connections @xmath91 into the @xmath132-th non - driver node .",
    "this principle allows us to make hypotheses about the function of a network given its structure .",
    "brain regions that have very similar connection distributions form a parallelotope with a very small volume , implying that most state changes will be prohibitively energetically costly . hence",
    ", the subspace of energetically viable state changes will be of fairly low dimension .",
    "however , very differentially connected regions will form a parallelotope with much larger volume , allowing the subspace of energetically viable state changes to be of higher dimension .",
    "these results inform the development of analytical constraints on the accessible state space of a networked system @xcite , particularly informing the set of states within which one might seek to push the brain using stimulation paradigms common in the treatment of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease @xcite .",
    "while many initial studies have examined unconstrained state spaces @xcite , understanding viable states and state trajectories is critical for the translation of these ideas into the clinic @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "to provide further insights into the potential utility of these approaches in informing interventions in brain systems , we formally quantified the contribution of the network topology to the control energy as a sum of contributions from each non - driver , where each contribution was a function of the magnitude and angle of @xmath91 .",
    "this formulation allowed us to identify brain regions that were inherently costly to control , and therefore potentially should be chosen as stimulation targets with careful consideration .",
    "moreover , we were able to use a greedy algorithm to find the set of @xmath53 non - drivers that maximized or minimized this topology - based energy component . through this topology - based energy contribution , we obtained approximate answers to questions such as `` which sets of brain regions are easiest _ versus _ most difficult to control , '' and `` which non - drivers should be designated drivers to most improve controllability . ''",
    "importantly , these insights lay the groundwork for the optimization of stimulation sites in neural systems , a problem that has received very little theoretical treatment , and is considered one of the current critical challenges in neuroengineering @xcite .    finally , we used the scaling principle of the gram determinant to make strategic , task - agnostic edge deletions that maximally increased the determinant .",
    "we saw that even the deletion of 1 edge occasionally produced a 50% reduction in total control energy , while the deletion of 4 edges occasionally produced an 80% reduction in total control energy .",
    "the first insight was that , even in an overdetermined , unsimplified system ( @xmath133 ) , a single edge deletion could produce such a profound improvement in the general controllability of a network .",
    "this sensitivity suggests that dynamical networks such as the brain can produce fairly drastic changes in dynamical behavior given minute changes in physiological topology , consistent with observations of critical dynamics in human and animal neurophysiology @xcite .",
    "moreover , these results also suggest that minor , targeted structural changes through concussive injury can lead to drastic changes in overall brain function @xcite , via altering the controllability landscape of the brain @xcite .",
    "the second interesting insight was that these topological modifications were task - agnostic edge deletions , signifying that even in a linear regime , the presence of an unfavorable edge can have a profoundly negative impact on the controllability of a network .",
    "we note that it is trivial to perform a similar analysis that takes into account the specific tasks @xmath134 by taking the derivative of the full energy term @xmath135 with respect to @xmath55 , which would optimize the network topology for a specific task , as studied in more detail in @xcite .",
    "emerging neurotechnologies are uncovering the richness of brain connectivity with unprecedented detail @xcite .",
    "the fine - scale maps produced by these efforts make quantiative cross - species comparison tractable in a way that was not possible in previous years @xcite . here",
    ", we take advantage of these advances to address the question of whether and how species differ in brain network controllability .",
    "importantly , the more general question of whether brain network architecture in different species harbors similar or distinct topological attributes is not a new one @xcite .",
    "the majority of work has focused on reporting cross - species similarities , while few have addressed the question of evolutionary drivers explaining differences across species capable of more or less complex function @xcite . here",
    "we find a monotonic gradation in the mapping between edge strength and topological angle across the 3 species , suggesting that increasingly complex species are more energetically favorably wired .",
    "interestingly , the human , in addition to being most energetically favorably wired , also had the smallest percent decrease in energy following edge - deletion .",
    "these results point to an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs , while remaining unexpectedly robust to perturbations .",
    "it will be interesting in the future to expand this analysis to the connectomes of other species as they become available , and also to examine brain network robustness in individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury @xcite .      in this paper , we apply our theoretical framework to real - world data collected via tract - tracing in drosophila and mouse , and via diffusion imaging in human .",
    "such brain networks represent particularly important contexts in which to understand control @xcite . even at the microscale of individual neurons , neural control",
    "engineering @xcite seeks to identify minimal energy control @xcite , that can potentially be used to explain homeostatic mechanisms controlling abonormal bursts of activity @xcite or to develop exogeneous control strategies to terminate bursts @xcite .",
    "open questions surround the role of symmetries @xcite or synchronizability @xcite within the network that may constrain these control properties . at the macroscale of centimeter - sized brain regions ,",
    "network control offers a novel perspective on how the brain controls itself , a characteristic known to cognitive neuroscientists as _ cognitive control _",
    "@xcite , as well as which mental states might be preferred @xcite , and how both features may be altered following traumatic brain injury @xcite . indeed , in clinical populations",
    "the need for realistic , low - energy control systems is particularly pressing , for example to restore neural function in parkinson s disease @xcite , to supress bursting activity in coma @xcite , and to control the distributed propagation of seizures @xcite in epilepsy , which has become known as an inherently network - based disorder @xcite .",
    "our results offer a novel framework in which to address these questions and challenges , as well as tools to design interventions ( the strengthening and weakening of neural connections ) to facilitate optimal control and enhance therapeutic benefit @xcite .      the work is built on several important assumptions that bring with them significant theoretical considerations .",
    "first , we only consider first - order connections from driver nodes to non - driver nodes .",
    "in other words , we study paths of length @xmath136 between drivers and non - drivers ; we do not study the propagation of control energy through longer paths or walks in the network .",
    "this is an inherent limitation of the work , as it is clear from prior studies that the strength of long walks through the network has a non - trivial impact on the control energy @xcite . to address this limitation ,",
    "we demonstrate that this simplification enables us to better understand the dependence of control energy on network topology .",
    "moreover , we show that these first - order control dynamics can offer reasonable approximations for non - simplified networks constructed from real - world neuroimaging data in drosophila , mouse , and human .",
    "second , we assume that these networks adhere to linear dynamics @xcite , which may limit the applicability of the results to ( i ) linear systems , or ( ii ) nonlinear systems for which control is sought in short time intervals , enabling a linearization of the dynamics around the operating point @xcite",
    ". moreover , in the context of our application to understand neural architecture , this choice is consistent with prior brain network control studies , such as @xcite , as well as prior mathematical modeling studies on human neuroimaging data @xcite .",
    "third , we assume that the input functions are chosen in such a way as to minimize both the control energy and the distance of the current state from the target state @xcite .",
    "importantly , these assumptions represent the best case scenario , offering a lower - bound on the relationships between topology and control energy .",
    "additional variables of interest to examine in future studies include the time scales of control and the tortuosity of the trajectory .",
    "finally , as with all empirical data , the connectomes of the drosophila , mouse , and human are fundamentally estimates of the true large - scale brain connectivity , and emerging neurotechnologies will likely offer increasingly accurate estimates .",
    "a specific limitation of the human connectome that is important to mention is that the diffusion imaging data must be submitted to sophisticated tractography algorithms to construct region - to - region estimates of structural connectivity .",
    "while evolving at a swift pace , these algorithms may still report spurious tracts or fail to report existing tracts @xcite .",
    "however , these issues are somewhat mitigated by the fact that we use an exceptionally high - resolution scan , capitalizing on a multiband sequence taking place over 55 minutes , and estimating diffusion over 705 directions , thereby increasing the resolution of the data by an order of magnitude over most existing studies ( which estimate diffusion over 30 - 64 diffusion directions ) .      in closing",
    ", we note that the natural direction in which to take this work will be to include higher order interactions in the bipartite framework , and further to expand the bipartite framework to include driver@xmath0driver and non - driver@xmath0non - driver interactions .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to apply this reduced framework to random graphs and other well - known benchmarks  both from a mathematical perspective @xcite and also in the context of neural systems @xcite  to better understand the phenotypes present in those graph ensembles .",
    "third and finally , informing the design of new networks with these tools may be particularly useful in neuromorphic computing @xcite , material science @xcite , and other contexts where optimal control of physical systems is of paramount importance .",
