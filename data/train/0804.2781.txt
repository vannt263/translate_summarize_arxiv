    "recently , quasi - one - dimensional compounds , @xmath10o@xmath1 ( @xmath11 = alkaline earth metals such as ca , sr _ etc . _ ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are transition metals ) possessing rhombohedral k@xmath14cdcl@xmath1 structure ( space group _ r@xmath15c _ ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their fascinating magnetic properties.@xcite in this structure ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath12o@xmath1 forms in trigonal prismatic geometry and @xmath13o@xmath1 forms in octahedral geometry . these two units appear alternatively along the chain direction , @xmath16-axis and are connected via face sharing as shown in the figure .",
    "it is evident that the interchain interaction is significantly weak making these compounds a quasi - one - dimensional system .",
    "it is observed that antiferromagnetic , ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic long - range ordered phases can be achieved by tuning the intrachain magnetic coupling in these one dimension chains.@xcite in addition to such interesting properties of the quasi - one - dimensional chains , the whole system can be viewed as made off antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic chains arranged in a triangular lattice .",
    "numerous studies based on tailoring the composition of these geometrically frustrated systems reveal plethora of novel phases such as spin liquid phase , partially disordered antiferromagnetic phase _",
    "etc._@xcite    in this paper , we report our results on the electronic structure of sr@xmath0nirho@xmath1 using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method .",
    "this compound exhibits ferrimagnetic intrachain ordering below 45 k. further lowering in temperature leads to partially disordered antiferromagnetic phase below 10 k.@xcite interestingly , analogous compound sr@xmath0nipto@xmath1 exhibits spin - liquid behavior .",
    "while it is difficult to capture disorder effect and/or spin liquid phase using such _ ab initio _ band structure calculations , sr@xmath0nirho@xmath1 is a good starting point to understand the intrachain coupling and associated ground state properties .",
    "our results clearly establish that the ground state of this compound consists of magnetic ni and rh ions which are antiferromagnetically coupled along the @xmath16-axis . to capture the insulating transport consistent with experimental observations",
    ", one needs to consider the on - site coulomb interaction among ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 electrons in addition to the intrachain antiferromagnetic ( iafm ) coupling , which suggests that this compound is a mott insulator . on - site",
    "coulomb interaction among rh 4@xmath3 electrons is found to be lower ( about 60% ) than that found for ni 3@xmath3 electrons as expected due to larger radial extension of the rh 4@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the spin polarized gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) and gga+@xmath2 ( @xmath2 = on - site coulomb repulsion strength ) electronic structure calculations were carried out using _ state - of - the art _ full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method.@xcite the lattice parameters and atomic positions used in the calculations are taken from literature.@xcite the muffin - tin sphere radii were chosen to be 2.33 , 2.19 , 2.01 , and 1.78 a.u . for sr , ni , rh , and o atoms , respectively . for the exchange correlation",
    "functional , we have adopted recently developed gga form of wu _",
    "et al._@xcite the on - site coulomb interactions were considered within lsda+@xmath2 ( lsda = local spin density approximation ) formulation of anisimov _",
    "et al_.@xcite the calculations were performed by varying on - site coulomb interaction among ni 3@xmath3 electrons , @xmath6 and rh 4@xmath3 electrons , @xmath4 .",
    "the convergence was achieved by considering 512 @xmath17 points within the first brillouin zone and the error bar for the energy convergence was set to be smaller than 10@xmath18 ryd / cell .",
    "the crystal structure of sr@xmath19nirho@xmath20 is hexagonal as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the sr , ni , rh , and o ions are denoted by spheres of decreasing size .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the ni and rh ions are surrounded by six oxygen ions forming trigonal prism and octahedron , respectively .",
    "the trigonal prisms and octahedra are connected by face sharing and form the chains along the @xmath16-axis . if the axis system is defined such that @xmath21-axis is along @xmath16-axis and @xmath22- and @xmath23-axis are in the @xmath24-plane , _ both _",
    "ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 orbitals defined in this axis system will not be degenerate due to the corresponding crystal field effect .",
    "there will be three bands consisting of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals .",
    "the energy separation and the location of the bands in the energy axis will depend on the type of crystal field is applicable as discussed later in the text .",
    "sr is represented by largest symbols ( black ) . gradually decreasing sized symbols represent ni ( pink ) , rh ( blue ) and o ( green ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the partial density of states ( pdos ) corresponding to ni 3@xmath3 , rh 4@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 electronic states obtained from gga calculations , where ni and rh are ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "the band splitting due to the crystal field as discussed above is visible clearly in the figure . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the energy range above -2 ev is essentially contributed by ni 3@xmath3 electronic states .",
    "the lower energy region ( -4 to -2 ev ) contains very low intensity of ni 3@xmath3 pdos and has dominant o 2@xmath7 contributions .",
    "the energy distributions of the density of states ( dos ) corresponding to both ni 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 states appear similar .",
    "these results suggest that the dos in -4 to -2 ev range can be attributed to bonding states arising from ni 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 hybridizations and the antibonding states with dominant ni 3@xmath3 character appear above -2 ev .",
    "( thin solid lines ) , @xmath26 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath27 ( thick solid lines ) orbitals for ( a ) ni and ( b ) rh obtained from spin - polarized gga calculation when ni and rh are ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "( c ) o 2@xmath7 pdos.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    the dos in the energy ranges -6.3 to -4.4 ev and -1.5 to 0 ev correspond to rh 4@xmath3-o 2@xmath7 bonding and antibonding bands , respectively .",
    "the intensity of rh 4@xmath3 pdos is almost similar in these two regions , with negligible contribution in the energy region of -4.4 to -1.5 ev ( see fig .",
    "two distinct features are observed in fig .",
    "( i ) the energy separation between bonding and antibonding bands arising due to ni 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath7 hybridizations is significantly smaller than the energy separation between the bonding and antibonding rh 4@xmath3-o 2@xmath7 bands .",
    "( ii ) the bonding and antibonding ni 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath7 bands have dominant o 2@xmath7 and ni 3@xmath3 character , respectively .",
    "however , the mixing of rh 4@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 characters in the rh 4@xmath3-o 2@xmath7 hybridization is much stronger .",
    "these observations clearly demonstrate the stronger o 2@xmath7-rh 4@xmath3 hybridization presumably due to larger radial extension of the 4@xmath3 orbitals compared to the 3@xmath3 orbitals . such large overlap integral , @xmath28 leads to larger separation of the bonding and antibonding bands .",
    "however , the bandwidth of the individual bands does not appear to increase .",
    "in addition , it is evident from fig .",
    "2(a ) that up - spin channel of ni 3@xmath3 states is almost fully occupied , whereas down - spin channel is partially occupied .",
    "major contribution in the unoccupied level comes from @xmath26 orbitals . in the case of rh 4@xmath3 states , dos corresponding to both the spin states are partially occupied and thus , contribute to the unoccupied dos .",
    "the gga calculations for ferromagnetic ( fm ) intrachain coupling converged to the metallic ground state in sharp contrast to the experimentally observed insulating behavior in this compound .",
    "moreover , the total magnetic moment per formula unit ( fu ) obtained from this calculation is about 2.85 @xmath29 , which is much larger than the experimentally estimated value of @xmath8  1  @xmath29.@xcite the magnetic moment centered at ni and rh sites are 1.55 @xmath29 and 0.43 @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "magnetic moment centered at the oxygen sites is found to be 0.13 @xmath29 , which is large and induced by the ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 moments .",
    "it is evident from the magnetic moments that if ni and rh are antiferromagnetically coupled , the total magnetic moment would match with the experimental results . in order to investigate such possibility",
    ", we have calculated the ground state energies and wavefunctions corresponding to antiferromagnetic coupling between ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 moments .",
    "interestingly , the calculated ground state energy is found to be 27 mev / fu lower than that of fm state .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moment comes out to be 1.04 @xmath29/fu .",
    "both these findings provide remarkable representation of the experimental magnetization data.@xcite the calculated magnetic moments for ni and rh are 1.31 @xmath29 and -0.36 @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the moment centered at oxygen site is almost negligible ( 0.02 @xmath29 ) .",
    "the calculated ni 3@xmath3 , rh 4@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 pdos are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident from the figure that intrachain antiferromagnetic interaction leads to significant reduction in bandwidth of all the energy bands and redistribution in spectral weight .",
    "for example , ni 3@xmath3 up spin band is almost completely filled and the fermi level , @xmath30 is pinned at the top of the down spin band having dominant @xmath27 contributions and a width of about 0.5 ev while ni 3@xmath3 down spin band in fig .",
    "2 has a width of about 1 ev and is partially filled .",
    "the occupancy of rh 4@xmath3 up spin and down spin pdos exhibit spectral distribution opposite to that observed in fig .",
    "2 as expected due to antiferromagnetic coupling . in this case also the bands are narrower than those observed in fig .",
    "2 . the o 2@xmath7 contribution at the fermi level is dominant for up spin while in the ferromagnetic case it was down spin .",
    "( thin solid lines ) , @xmath26 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath27 ( thick solid lines ) orbitals for ( a ) ni and ( b ) rh obtained from spin - polarized gga calculation when intrachain ni and rh are antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "( c ) o 2@xmath7 pdos.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    all the above results clearly establish that the lsda approach is adequate to capture the magnetic phase in this system .",
    "although , there is significant spectral weight redistributions observed for different magnetic configurations , both these calculations converge to metallic ground state in contrast to the experimental studies .",
    "it is well known that such _",
    "ab initio _ calculations often underestimate the on - site coulomb correlation energy , which plays significant role in determining the electronic properties of @xmath3 and @xmath31 electron systems.@xcite the consideration of on - site coulomb interaction among the @xmath3 electrons ( @xmath32 ) under gga+@xmath2 formulation is expected to improve the situation .",
    "thus , we have carried out gga+@xmath2 calculations for different values of @xmath32 corresponding to ni 3@xmath3 electrons , which is defined as @xmath6 and rh 4@xmath3 electrons , which is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "the calculations were carried out considering the intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the calculated band gaps in the vicinity of @xmath30 for up spin and down spin density of states are shown in fig .",
    "4 . it is evident from the figure that consideration of the electron correlation for both ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 electrons helps to achieve the insulating phase .",
    "we have shown two types of results in the figure , ( i ) the dependence of the band gap as a function of @xmath6 for a fixed value of @xmath4 = 3 ev and ( ii ) band gap as a function of @xmath4 for a fixed value of @xmath6 = 5.5 ev . in the up spin channel ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , it is evident that an increase in @xmath6 does not lead to insulating phase till @xmath6 = 4 ev .",
    "an increase in @xmath6 above 4 ev provides an energy gap of about 0.12 ev .",
    "interestingly , the band gap remains unchanged for further increase in @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath6 = 5.5 ev , indicate gradual increase in band gap .",
    "thus , the energy gap is essentially determined by @xmath4 when @xmath6 is kept large .",
    "4(a ) suggests that the creation of insulating ground state requires @xmath4 to be at least 2.6 ev .",
    "since the coulomb repulsion strength depends inversely on the separation of the two electrons , the strength of on - site coulomb interaction is sensitive to the radial extension of the wave functions .",
    "the present result of @xmath6 larger than @xmath4 is consistent with this behavior .",
    "( @xmath6 ) and rh 4@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) electrons vs. insulating gap for ( a ) up - spin and ( b ) down - spin channels .",
    "two cases are considered : ( i ) @xmath4 is fixed at 3 ev and @xmath6 varied from 3.5 to 5.5 ev ( solid circles ) and ( ii ) @xmath6 is fixed at 5.5 ev and @xmath4 varied from 3 to 5 ev ( open circles).,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    calculations for the down spin channel exhibit gradual increase in band gap with the increase in @xmath32 for both ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 electrons .",
    "the magnitude of the gap in this case is always much higher ( @xmath9 2 ev ) than that ( @xmath33 1 ev ) observed for up spin density of states .",
    "it is thus clear that various electronic properties of this compound will essentially be controlled by electronic density of states in the up spin channel .    in order to investigate the character of the electronic states in the valence band ,",
    "we show the calculated pdos for @xmath6 = 5 ev and @xmath4 = 3 ev in fig .",
    "all the bands are significantly modified due to the spectral weight transfer from @xmath30 to the energy region away from it .",
    "ni 3@xmath26 contributions exhibit significant band narrowing .",
    "the up spin bands appear around -5.8 ev and the down spin ones around 2.5 ev .",
    "the contributions from other ni 3@xmath3 orbitals appear between -2 ev to -5 ev .",
    "interestingly , the consideration of @xmath6 leads to a significant increase of ni 3@xmath3 character at higher energies .",
    "thus the o 2@xmath7 contributions relative to ni 3@xmath3 become significantly high in the vicinity of the fermi level .",

    "( c ) o 2@xmath7 pdos.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    consideration of the on - site coulomb interaction among rh 4@xmath3 electrons reveals large effect on the density of states distribution . in the gga calculation @xmath25 was almost fully occupied and there was a significant contribution of @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals within 0.28 ev of @xmath30 in the unoccupied up spin channel as evident from fig .",
    "this trend is reversed in gga+@xmath2 calculations , where region within 0.75 ev above the @xmath30 is contributed by the electronic states having @xmath25 character .",
    "the electronic states below @xmath30 are contributed by @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals .    despite the fact that the ni 3@xmath3 pdos appear far away from @xmath30",
    ", it has finite contribution in the vicinity of @xmath30 .",
    "this is evident in the rescaled ni 3@xmath3 pdos ( @xmath34 15 + 1 ) shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) by dot - dashed line .",
    "interestingly , the energy distribution of these density of states closely follows the distribution observed in rh 4@xmath3 and o 2@xmath7 pdos .",
    "this clearly manifests the effect of hybridization between ni 3@xmath3 and rh 4@xmath3 states via o 2@xmath7 states .",
    "most interestingly , the gap in the up spin channel is much smaller than that found in down spin channel .",
    "thus , this system provides an unique example of a semiconductor , where the electronic conduction is spin polarized .",
    "_ while half - metallic materials have long been investigated due to spin polarized conduction of charge carriers in this system .",
    "this compound manifests properties that can be more useful in the semiconductor industry , where spin based technology is envisaged .",
    "_    now , we discuss the manifestation of intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling and coulomb correlation in the band structure along different high symmetry directions of the brillouin zone .",
    "the dispersion curves corresponding to different bands for fm , iafm and iafm considering @xmath6 = 5 and @xmath4 = 3 ev for both the spin channels are plotted in fig .",
    "the zero in the energy scale indicates @xmath30 . in the ferromagnetic solution",
    ", the up spin bands along @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions do not cross the fermi level , while the down spin bands cross @xmath30 in all the directions indicating half metallicity along these directions .",
    "the antiferromagnetic coupling among ni and rh in the chains leads to narrowing of the bands and the up spin bands cross the fermi level in all the directions . on the other hand",
    "the down spin bands in the vicinity of @xmath30 essentially appear below @xmath30 .",
    "again , the band crossing of the down spin band is observed only along @xmath37 direction suggesting half metallicity in other directions .",
    "+    inclusion of the electron correlation among the @xmath3 electrons leads to significant change in the band structure . while , there is a hard gap in both the spin channels consistent with the transport behavior of this compound , the gap exhibit significant @xmath17-dependence .",
    "the gap at the high symmetry point , @xmath38 is lower than that observed at @xmath12 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 points .",
    "interestingly , the dispersion of the bands close to @xmath30 appears to be larger than that observed in the uncorrelated case .",
    "this indicates that although electron correlation essentially tends to localize the electrons , the electronic states in the vicinity of the fermi level are highly mobile .",
    "the occupancies of different @xmath3 orbitals corresponding to ni and rh obtained from gga+@xmath2 ( @xmath6 = 5 and @xmath4 = 3 ev ) calculation are shown in table 1 . in up spin channel ,",
    "all the ni 3@xmath3 orbitals are almost completely filled and in down spin channel , only @xmath25 orbital is completely filled .",
    "the small deviations ( @xmath8 0.05 ) from the completely filled values can be attributed to the hybridization of ni 3@xmath3 orbitals with the neighboring o 2@xmath7 orbitals .",

    "our calculations exhibit 5.69 electrons in the rh 4@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "if we consider o in 2- and sr in 2 + states , then charge neutrality condition demands rh to be in 4 + state , which corresponds to 5 electrons in the 4@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the extra 0.69 electrons can be attributed to strong hybridization of rh 4@xmath3 orbitals with the neighboring o 2@xmath7 orbitals .    the calculated magnetic moments for ni and rh ions are 1.69 @xmath29 and -0.68 @xmath29 , respectively , with almost negligible contribution from oxygen ( 0.01 @xmath29 ) .",

    "in conclusion , we studied the electronic and magnetic properties of sr@xmath0nirho@xmath1 using _ ab initio _ spin polarized band structure calculations within gga and gga+@xmath2 . the calculations for intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling exhibit the lowest energy .",
    "the magnetic moments of ni and rh ions were found to be @xmath81.7 @xmath29 and -0.7 @xmath29 , respectively , with a total moment of about 1 @xmath29 .",
    "all these results corresponding to the magnetic phase provide a remarkable representation of the experimental results .",
    "the insulating phase observed in transport measurements could not be captured within gga suggesting importance of electron correlation .",
