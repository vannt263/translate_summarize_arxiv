    "a stochastic system is characterized by the rates of the stochastic transitions between the possible states .",
    "the dynamics of the stochastic system may be probed by a detector that is sensitive to one or several ( but , in general , not all ) of the possible transitions . in biological physics ,",
    "stochastic transitions like the steps of motor proteins  @xcite , intramolecular conformational changes  @xcite , and enzymatic turnovers generating fluorescent products  @xcite have been studied .",
    "detectors are optical tweezers  @xcite , atomic force , or fluorescence microscopes  @xcite . in mesoscopic physics , discrete charge - transfer events",
    "@xcite through single-  @xcite and multi - level  @xcite quantum dots , interferometers  @xcite , superconducting  @xcite and feedback - controlled systems  @xcite have been studied .",
    "charge transfers can be detected by a quantum point contact  @xcite , a single - electron transistor  @xcite , optical  @xcite , or interferometric detectors  @xcite .",
    "counting the number @xmath0 of transitions within a time interval @xmath1 $ ] repeatedly many times yields the probability distribution @xmath2 , referred to as _",
    "full counting statistics_. for a well - characterized system , the states , the rates between them , and the coupling to the detector are known .",
    "it is , then , straightforward to compute the full counting statistics and compare it with experimentally measured data .",
    "suppose , however , that the underlying model for a stochastic system is unclear and the only information available is the counting statistics measured by the detector .",
    "it is , then , desirable to have a systematic approach to distill out of the measured counting statistics the relevant information for reconstructing properties of the underlying model , including basic properties such as the number of states of the stochastic system .",
    "such an approach can be dubbed _",
    "inverse counting statistics _",
    "@xcite .    what are the properties of the stochastic system that one may hope to reconstruct by inverse counting statistics ?",
    "first of all , there is the number @xmath3 of possible system states .",
    "second , the stochastic system is characterized by the spectrum of relaxation rates with which it relaxes back to its ( equilibrium or nonequilibrium ) steady state after being disturbed externally  @xcite .",
    "of course , inverse counting statistics can not distinguish between different stochastic systems that are equivalent in the sense that they produce the same counting statistics , even if the stochastic systems possess a different numbers of states .",
    "therefore , inverse counting statistics can at most deliver the _",
    "minimal _ number of system states necessary that is compatible with the observed counting statistics .    to make the inverse counting statistics a powerful and practical tool",
    ", one should keep the circumstances for the acquisition of the input data as transparent and as simple as possible .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the following scenario .",
    "first , only steady - state counting statistics is considered , i.e. , we assume that the system has already relaxed before counting starts .",
    "this excludes studying transient behavior after a perturbation of the system .",
    "the latter would , on the one hand , offer a direct access to some relaxation rate of the system  @xcite . on the other hand , the determination of the full spectrum of relaxation rates would require the knowledge of how to perturb the system in order to probe a specific relaxation rate .",
    "second , we concentrate on the limit of long measuring - time intervals @xmath1 $ ] , for which the system dynamics is dominated by the slowest relaxation rate only .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure of inverse counting statistics yields the full spectrum of all relaxation rates , as explained below .",
    "given a measured distribution @xmath2 , what are the input data for the inverse counting statistics ?",
    "in  bruderer_inverse_2014 , it was suggested to use the ( long - time ) cumulants of the distribution function .",
    "here , we propose to use generalized factorial cumulants  @xcite instead .",
    "the advantage of the latter is that they depend on an arbitrarily chosen parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the outcome of the inverse counting statistics ( such as the number of system states or the spectrum of relaxation rates ) should , however , not depend on this parameter  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4-independence of the results defines a powerful consistency criterion .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in section  [ sec : sebandreev ] , there are special cases in which part of the relaxation - rate spectrum is not accessible by inverse counting statistics with ordinary cumulants but is detectable by using generalized factorial cumulants with properly chosen parameter  @xmath4 . as another difference to  bruderer_inverse_2014 , where the detector was assumed to be sensitive to only a single transition between two specific states increasing the detector counter just by one , we allow for a more general system - detector coupling , taking into account arbitrarily many transitions between arbitrarily many states increasing the detector counter by an arbitrary amount .",
    "therefore , our inverse counting procedure does not only test compatibility with the number @xmath3 of system states but also with a parameter @xmath5 that depends on the system - detector coupling as explained below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fcs ]",
    ", we give a short introduction how full counting statistics , especially generalized factorial cumulants , are calculated by means of a markovian master equation .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ sec : ics ] , we explain the general procedure of inverse counting statistics .",
    "this procedure is , then , illustrated in sections  [ sec : qdzee ] and [ sec : sebandreev ] for two model systems : a single - level quantum dot in a zeeman field and a single - electron box subjected to sequential and andreev tunneling .",
    "states . transitions are indicated by arrows .",
    "dashed arrows indicate transitions counted by the detector with counting factors  @xmath6 . ]",
    "we consider stochastic systems as represented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "there are @xmath3 system states , labeled by @xmath7 .",
    "systems with coherent superposition of different @xmath7 are not taken into account .",
    "arrows indicate transitions from state @xmath7 to state @xmath8 with a transition rate @xmath9 .",
    "the counting factors @xmath6 with @xmath10 next to the dashed arrows specify the coupling of the system to the detector : if the system undergoes such a transition , the number @xmath0 counted by the detector increases by @xmath11 . there may be also processes with rate @xmath12 monitored by the detector in which the system ends up in the same state @xmath7 as it started , which is , e.g. , the case for cotunneling through a magnetic atom  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the duration of all the transition processes is shorter than the time resolution of the detector . in this case , the system s dynamics can be described by a markovian master equation , and non - markovian effects  @xcite do not need to be taken into account .    without the detector , the master equation for the probabilities @xmath13 to find the system in state @xmath7 takes the form @xmath14 \\ , .\\ ] ] the first term of the sum describes transitions into state @xmath7 , the second term transitions out of state @xmath7 . to account for the detector",
    ", we need to replace this master equation for @xmath15 by an @xmath0-resolved one for @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the number of detector counts in the time interval @xmath1 $ ] . for this",
    ", we introduce the coupling constants @xmath17 which is @xmath18 if the detector count is increased by @xmath11 for the transition from @xmath8 to @xmath7 , and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "we obtain @xmath20 solving for the @xmath0-resolved probabilities yields the counting statistics of the detector via @xmath21 .",
    "we now turn to the question of how to extract from a given distribution @xmath2 the information that serves as an input for the inverse counting statistics .",
    "one possibility would be to use the ( long - time ) cumulants of the distribution function , as suggested in  bruderer_inverse_2014 . here ,",
    "we propose , as an alternative , to employ generalized factorial cumulants  @xcite in the long - time limit .",
    "generalized factorial cumulants are derived from the generating function @xmath22 by evaluating the derivatives @xmath23 the special case @xmath24 recovers the factorial cumulants recently introduced in the context of mesoscopic transport  @xcite .",
    "they are called _ factorial _ because the corresponding moments @xmath25 are expectation values of the _ factorial _ power @xmath26 instead of the ordinary power @xmath27 which defined ordinary moments and cumulants . _",
    "generalized _ factorial cumulants depend on an extra parameter  @xmath4 that describes a shift of the complex variable @xmath28 by the amount @xmath29 along the real axis in the complex plane .",
    "in contrast to previous works  @xcite , we define the generating function without a normalization factor @xmath30 .",
    "such a @xmath28-independent normalization factor would not influence the cumulants of order @xmath31 , but it would set , per definition , @xmath32 . without this normalization factor , @xmath33 contains non - trivial information that can be used for the inverse counting statistics . both factorial ( @xmath24 ) and generalized factorial cumulants ( @xmath34 )",
    "have been utilized to detect correlations in charge - transfer statistics  @xcite .    in the context of inverse",
    "counting statistics , the parameter  @xmath4 will play a very important role in two respects . first , since the underlying stochastic model for a measured distribution @xmath2 is independent of @xmath4 , the outcome of the inverse counting statistics must also be independent of the parameter  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the required @xmath4-independence of the obtained results defines a criterion for the compatibility of the measured data with the assumed underlying model .",
    "second , as we will see below , there are special cases in which the inverse counting statistics with factorial cumulants ( @xmath24 ) would indicate compatibility with a too small stochastic system and only generalized factorial cumulants ( @xmath34 ) reveal the higher dimension of the underlying stochastic model .    to calculate the generalized factorial cumulants for a given stochastic system , it is convenient to first perform a @xmath28-transform of the @xmath0-resolved master equation equation  ( [ eq : masternresolved ] ) , i.e. , multiply with @xmath35 and then sum over @xmath0 .",
    "if we combine the @xmath28-transformed @xmath0-resolved probabilities @xmath36 of the different states @xmath7 in a vector @xmath37 , the @xmath28-transformed master equation can be written in the form @xmath38 with matrix elements @xmath39 two examples for @xmath40 are given in equations   and .",
    "for @xmath41 , equation  ( [ eq : masterz ] ) is nothing but the master equation equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "the solution of equation   is @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath43 , the initial vector @xmath44 is independent of @xmath28 and describes the initial probability distribution .",
    "the matrix exponential @xmath45{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{j , z } \\otimes { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{l}}}_{j , z}^{t}$ ] can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum @xmath46 of @xmath40 by making use of the decomposition into the left and right eigenvector @xmath47 and @xmath48 with normalization @xmath49 .",
    "for an arbitrary initial distribution @xmath44 of the system , the systems relaxes exponentially in time to its steady state , governed by the eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath50 at @xmath41 are the system s relaxation rates mentioned in the introduction .",
    "they are either real or they appear as complex - conjugated pairs . in the following ,",
    "we assume that electron counting starts only after the system has reached its steady state , i.e. , @xmath44 is the stationary probability distribution , determined by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where we defined @xmath53 to sum over all states @xmath7 in @xmath44 .    finally , taking into account that the generating function can be written as @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55_{z = s}\\ , .\\ ] ] the summation over @xmath56 complicates the time dependence of the generalized factorial cumulants . in the long - time limit",
    ", however , the above expression becomes considerably simpler since the exponential factors suppress all terms of the sum except the ones with the largest real part @xmath57 $ ] for @xmath58 . for @xmath41 and systems with a unique stationary state ,",
    "the dominant eigenvalue is @xmath19 ,",
    "i.e. , all other eigenvalues have a negative real part . around @xmath41 ,",
    "the dominant eigenvalue , denoted by @xmath59 , remains real and the limit @xmath60 provides well - defined constants , referred to as scaled long - time ( generalized factorial ) cumulants .",
    "these scaled long - time cumulants define the input information for the inverse counting statistics .",
    "if @xmath4 is chosen very negative , it may happen that the dominant eigenvalues are given by a complex - conjugated pair .",
    "in this case , the limit is not well defined and the inverse - counting - statistics procedure derived below can not be applied .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown how to calculate for a given stochastic model defined by the matrix @xmath61 ( referred to as the generator of the stochastic system ) the long - time ( generalized factorial ) cumulants .",
    "inverse counting statistics deals with the opposite problem : how much can we learn about the stochastic system if only a few numbers , namely the experimentally determined values of the scaled long - time cumulants ( up to some order ) , are given ? to be more specific , we aim at the following properties of the stochastic system .",
    "first , a very important feature of the stochastic system is the dimension @xmath3 of @xmath61 , i.e. , the number of participating states in the stochastic process .",
    "furthermore , the coupling to the detector is described by powers of @xmath28 attached to some matrix elements of the generator . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath62 is of order  @xmath5 in @xmath28 .",
    "thus , as a second feature , we identify the @xmath5 . we will show below that the values of the first @xmath63 scaled long - time cumulants are enough to check compatibility with a stochastic system of dimension @xmath3 and the order @xmath5 characterizing the coupling to the detector .",
    "but , with inverse counting statistics , we can get much more . from the @xmath63 input parameters",
    "@xmath64 it is possible to determine the full spectrum of @xmath61 , i.e. , the full @xmath28-dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath50 . to appreciate how remarkable this statement is ,",
    "let us remind that the input parameters are only a finite [ @xmath63 ] number of derivatives of only one eigenvalue @xmath66 at only one value of @xmath28 , namely the arbitrarily chosen @xmath4 . from this rather restricted amount of information , we aim at reconstructing also the other eigenvalues different from @xmath66 at all values of @xmath28 different from @xmath4 .",
    "how is this possible and how does it work in practice ?    to answer this question , we observe that the characteristic function of the generator  @xmath40 , @xmath67 is a polynomial both in @xmath68 ( of order @xmath3 ) and in @xmath28 ( of order @xmath5 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath50 , i.e. , the roots of the characteristic function , @xmath69 , are , in general , nonanalytic functions in @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath70 itself , however , is a polynomial in @xmath28 and can , therefore , be written in the form @xmath71 where @xmath4 is the arbitrarily chosen parameter of the generalized factorial cumulants . as a consequence , the ( @xmath4-independent ) characteristic function",
    "is fully determined by the @xmath63 real ( and @xmath4-dependent ) coefficients @xmath72 .",
    "this fixes all @xmath28-dependent ( but @xmath4-independent ) eigenvalues @xmath50 of the generator @xmath40 . for this reason ,",
    "@xmath63 input parameters are enough to fully determine the spectrum of @xmath40 .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 and @xmath5 are already known ( we will discuss below how this is done with the help of inverse counting statistics ) .",
    "how do we get the spectrum of @xmath40 ?",
    "as input parameters we use the scaled generalized factorial cumulants @xmath73 for @xmath74 in the long - time limit . to determine the coefficients @xmath75 , we perform @xmath76 times a derivative of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath28 and set @xmath58 afterwards . for technical reasons , it is convenient to divide the resulting equation by @xmath78 . then , we arrive at the set of linear equations @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 , defined for nonnegative @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , are given by @xmath85 and otherwise ( i.e. , @xmath86 together with @xmath87 ) by @xmath88 obviously , @xmath81 depends on @xmath82 and @xmath83 only via the difference @xmath89 ( this was the reason of dividing by @xmath78 ) .",
    "the multiple sum over the @xmath90 s is constrained by @xmath91 . an alternative expression for the @xmath81",
    "can be found in  [ sec : apprandtel ] .    to be explicit ,",
    "let us write down all the terms that are relevant for the case @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we need @xmath84 up to @xmath94 and @xmath82 up to @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath96 we get @xmath97 , for @xmath98 we have @xmath99 , and for @xmath100 we find @xmath101    to obtain the full spectrum @xmath102 , one first solves the set of linear equations equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) for @xmath75 .",
    "second , the result for @xmath75 is inserted into equation  ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) to get the characteristic function .",
    "finally , the zeros of the characteristic function are determined .",
    "it all works because the characteristic function is fully determined by a finite number of coefficients @xmath75 only .",
    "it is important to remark that , in general , there is no guarantee that the set of linear equations equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) provides a unique solution",
    ". there may be special situations ( we will discuss such a case below ) in which the generator @xmath40 is separable in the sense that its characteristic function can be written as a product of two polynomials , the first one of order @xmath103 and @xmath104 in @xmath28 and @xmath68 , the second one of order @xmath105 and @xmath106 . of course , it is trivial that the characteristic function can always be written as a product of two polynomials in @xmath68 , but separability requires that , in addition , the two polynomials in @xmath68 are polynomials in @xmath28 as well . for separable generators , inverse counting statistics has only access to the part of the spectrum to which the eigenvalue @xmath107 with the largest real part belongs , i.e. , the effective problem has reduced dimensions @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",
    "the remaining question to be answered is how to determine the dimensions @xmath3 and @xmath5 of the stochastic system . in the spirit of  bruderer_inverse_2014",
    ", one may suggest that after having determined @xmath107 from the first @xmath63 scaled long - time cumulants one can calculate the scaled cumulants of higher order and compare them with experimentally measured values . if @xmath3 and @xmath5 were chosen correctly",
    ", then one expects a coincidence of calculated and measured values .",
    "this has , however , two downsides .",
    "first , measuring cumulants of increasingly higher order may become more and more difficult .",
    "second , comparing just numbers to establish a consistency criterion may be of only limited significance in view of experimentally unavoidable noise .    with the use of generalized factorial cumulant , however , we can do much better .",
    "remember that the parameter @xmath4 was chosen arbitrarily and the result , i.e. , the spectrum of the generator , must be independent of this parameter  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we can use the very same measured time trace of the detector to determine scaled cumulants for different values of @xmath4 , run the inverse - counting - statistics procedure for each @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath5 were chosen correctly , then the full @xmath28-dependence of the full spectrum should be independent of the choice of @xmath4 .",
    "this establishes a much stronger consistency check than comparing just a few numbers .    in the following sections  [ sec : qdzee ] and [ sec : sebandreev ] , we illustrate the inverse - counting statistics procedure for two model systems : a single - level quantum dot in a zeeman field and a single - electron box subjected to sequential and andreev tunneling",
    "the first model system is depicted in figure  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "a single - level quantum dot is weakly tunnel coupled to one normal - state metallic lead @xmath0 and subjected to a magnetic field .",
    "the orbital level @xmath108 measured relative to lead s electrochemical potential is splitted by the zeeman energy @xmath109 into @xmath110 .",
    "the positive ( negative ) sign applies to a spin @xmath111 electron on the quantum dot .",
    "the current through a nearby quantum point contact is sensitive to the dot charge which allows to monitor the charge transfer between dot and lead as function of time .",
    "the empty dot @xmath19 can be occupied by a spin @xmath112 electron with the sequential tunneling rate @xmath113 given by fermi s golden rule .",
    "the reverse transition occurs with the rate @xmath114 $ ] , where @xmath115^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function .",
    "the temperature @xmath116 is as large that both @xmath117 and @xmath118 are nonvanishing , but transitions to higher charge states are negligible due to charging energy .",
    "the stochastic system is depicted in figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "its generator is given by @xmath119 the characteristic function is a polynomial of order @xmath92 in @xmath68 and of order @xmath120 in  @xmath28 .",
    "the case of vanishing magnetic field @xmath121 , however , is special because of spin degeneracy @xmath122 , and only two different rates @xmath123 and @xmath124 appear . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic function becomes separable , @xmath125 the first factor is a polynomial of order @xmath126 in @xmath68 and of order @xmath120 in @xmath28 , while the second factor is of order @xmath127 and independent of @xmath28 . due to the @xmath28-independency",
    ", the second factor does not influence counting statistics and thus can not be detected anymore .",
    "the electron transfer can be completely described by a spinless orbital which is occupied with rate @xmath128 and emptied with rate @xmath129 .",
    "note that a separable characteristic function does not always separate in a @xmath28-dependent and @xmath28-independent factor , an example will be given in section  [ sec : sebandreev ] .",
    "we start with discussing the case of nonvanishing magnetic field for which we choose @xmath130 and @xmath131 . the input information for the inverse counting statistics ( for @xmath92 and @xmath120 ) is given by the scaled long - time generalized factorial cumulants from order @xmath19 up to order @xmath132 . since in experiments , the measurement time is always finite , we do not take as input parameters the exact long - time scaled cumulants of the defined model but calculate , instead , the scaled cumulants at some large but finite time . hence , the scaled cumulants are close but not identical to the exact values in the long - time limit . for the exact long - time scaled cumulants ,",
    "a value for the dimension @xmath3 that was assumed to be too large , can be immediately identified by trying to solve the system of linear equations  ( [ eq : linear ] ) .",

    "second , there are special cases of separable characteristic functions , for which the inverse counting statistics with ordinary cumulants would only reveal part of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the generator , while the variation of @xmath4 makes it possible to access the full spectrum .",
