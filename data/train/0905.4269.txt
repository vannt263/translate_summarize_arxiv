    "one of the most astonishing discoveries of the last years has been the discovery that the universe has started recently to accelerate . a possibility to describe",
    "such an acceleration is within modified theories of gravity like the @xmath0dgp which , in addition , is able to mimic a phantom - like behaviour without invoking any real phantom matter on the brane or in the bulk .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath0dgp scenario is a 5d brane - world model with infrared modifications to general relativity caused by an induced gravity term on the brane @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the normal branch of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati proposal ( dgp ) @xcite , being the brane filled with cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant which drives the late - time acceleration of the brane .",
    "the phantom - like behaviour is a consequence of the extra - dimension which screens the brane cosmological constant and it is based in mapping the brane evolution to that of an equivalent 4d general relativistic phantom energy model @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the basis of this mimicry is an effective energy density ( in the 4d general relativistic picture ) corresponding to the cosmological constant corrected by the curvature effect due to the induced gravity term on the brane .",
    "this effective energy density grows as the brane expands and therefore effectively it behaves as a phantom fluid ; i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 corresponds to the ratio between the effective energy density and the effective pressure    the effective description of the phantom behaviour in the @xmath0dgp model breaks down at a finite redshift ; i.e. the effective energy density vanishes and becomes negative over a certain redshift .",
    "when the effective energy density vanishes , the effective equation of state blows up .",
    "given that the phantom - like behaviour results from ( @xmath3 ) induced gravity effects on the brane causing curvature corrections and ( @xmath4 ) describing the brane model as a 4d relativistic phantom energy setup , could the break down of the phantom - like behaviour be eliminated by considering further curvature effects on the brane - world scenario ? this is the main question we address in this paper .",
    "we will model such additional and new curvature effects through a gauss - bonnet term ( gb ) in the bulk @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath0dgp brane , i.e. the normal dgp branch filled with cdm and a cosmological constant , with gb corrections in the bulk .",
    "then the friedmann equation reads @xcite @xmath5e(z ) , \\label{friedmannz}\\ ] ] where we have assumed a mirror symmetry across the brane , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual convenient dimensionless parameters while the new parameter @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 finally , @xmath10 is the crossover scale in the dgp model and @xmath11 is the gb parameter in the bulk action .",
    "evaluating the friedmann equation ( [ friedmannz ] ) at @xmath12 gives a constraint on the cosmological parameters of the model @xmath13 this constraint implies that the region @xmath14 is unphysical .",
    "moreover , although the brane is spatially flat , the previous constraint can be interpreted in the sense that our model constitutes a mimic of a closed flrw universe .",
    "furthermore , by imposing that the universe is currently accelerating , we obtain another constraint on the set of cosmological parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which reads @xmath18 on the other hand , it can be shown that the brane never super - accelerates ; i.e. the hubble rate decreases as the brane accelerates .",
    "the phantom - like behaviour on the brane is based in defining a corresponding effective energy density @xmath19 and an effective equation of state with parameter @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , the effective description is inspired in writing down the modified friedmann equation of the brane as the usual relativistic friedmann equation so that @xmath20 where @xmath19 reads @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{rhoeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this effective energy density corresponds to a balance between the cosmological constant and geometrical effects encoded on the hubble parameter . on the other hand , gravity leakage at late - time screens the cosmological constant like in the @xmath0dgp scenario @xcite .",
    "this phantom - like behaviour is obtained without any matter violating the null energy condition and without any super - acceleration on the brane .    as in the @xmath0dgp model",
    ", it is possible to define an effective equation of state or parameter @xmath2 associated to the effective energy density as @xmath22 this effective equation of state is defined in analogy with the standard relativistic case . then using eq .",
    "( [ rhoeff ] ) , we obtain @xmath23}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the brane never super - accelerates , i.e. @xmath24 , we can then conclude that @xmath19 mimics the behaviour of a phantom energy component on the brane : i.e. @xmath25 , as long as the effective energy density @xmath19 is positive .",
    "however , there is always a redshift @xmath26 at which @xmath19 vanishes and therefore the phantom mimicry ceases to be valid .",
    "the above behaviour raises the following possibility : can the phantom behaviour break down in our model at a redshift @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the redshift at which the phantom mimicry is no longer valid in the @xmath0dgp model ?",
    "the answer will depend on the cosmological parameters that characterise both models , three in the @xmath0dgp scenario namely ( @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 ) and four in the model we are analysing namely ( @xmath15,@xmath32,@xmath16,@xmath17 ) .",
    "we consider that only one of the parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) is fixed in the @xmath0dgp - gb brane .",
    "we further assume that the given value of the fixed parameter is very close to that obtained by constraining the @xmath0dgp model with observational data ( @xmath33 , cmb shift parameter and snia data)@xcite @xmath34 our results are presented in figure [ zbbreak ] : the phantom - like behaviour in the @xmath0dgp - gb brane breaks down sooner ( smaller redshift ) than in the @xmath0dgp brane .",
    "we have analysed the @xmath0dgp - gb model which corresponds to a 5d brane - world model where the bulk is a 5d minkowski space - time .",
    "the model contains a gb term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on the brane .",
    "our analysis was performed for the normal branch which we have assumed to be filled by cdm and a cosmological constant , the latter driving the late - time acceleration of the brane .",
    "we have shown how the brane accelerates at late - times .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that there is a phantom - like behaviour on the brane without resorting to any real phantom matter on the brane or the bulk . however , the phantom - like behaviour in the @xmath0dgp - gb brane breaks down sooner ( smaller redshift ) than in the @xmath0dgp brane .",
    "namely , the @xmath0dgp has a regular phantom - like behaviour for @xmath35 whereas the phantom - like behaviour in the @xmath0dgp - gb model is regular only for @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the gb term does extend the regime of validity of the phantom mimicry in the @xmath0dgp model .",
    "at which the phantom - like behaviour in the @xmath0dgp - gb model breaks down .",
    "when @xmath38 , we obtain the redshift @xmath39 at which the phantom - like behaviour in the @xmath0dgp scenario breaks down . as can be noticed @xmath40.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]"
