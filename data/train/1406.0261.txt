    "nevertheless , when the strain along the @xmath21 direction is tensile , the @xmath38 decreases , and the dihedral angle formed by plane acd and abc also decreases because of the weakened _ van der waals _ interactions between layers . as a result , these factors together lead to the expansion of bp along the @xmath20 direction under tensile strain along the @xmath21 direction .",

    ", the compressive strain may suppress the band gap , and finally closes the gap , while the tensile strain may enlarge the band gap @xcite .",

    "a tensile strain does not turn the band gap of bp from direct into indirect within the range we considered ( less than @xmath46 ) , but makes the band gap increase almost linearly , while a small compressive strain ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) turns the band gap from direct to indirect .",

    "each layer of bp can be viewed similar to the structure of well - known graphene but significantly puckered .",
    "it reminds us that the single layer of bp should be another elemental two - dimensional material besides graphene and silicene",
    ". however , the in - plane anisotropy of the geometrical structure of bp could be the key fcator for the dominant difference between bp sheet and graphene , which leads to the unexpected mechanical , electronic and te properties as we presented above .",

    "this result is surprising that bp along the @xmath20 direction appears to be as soft as that along the @xmath21 direction , because in the former case every p atom is connected through covalent bonds while in the latter case the atoms between layers are bonded the _ van der waals_. this anisotropic property of bp could be a result of the hinge - like assembling structure .",

    "although thermopower is an important indicator when searching for te materials with excellent performance , the attention should also be paid to the electrical and thermal conductivity of the materials .",
    "the calculated maximal _ zt _ ( 0.72 ) of bp in the absence of a strain is distinctly smaller than that ( 2.6 ) of snse , which can be understood in this way .",
    "although bp has an anisotropic layered structure similar to snse , the symmetry of bp is higher than that of snse ; bp is an elemental phosphorus , while snse comprises of two different types of atoms ; thus the bonding and lattice anharmony of snse are much stronger than those of bp .",

    "we mentioned that some of the strain - induced _ zt _ enhancements happen to emerge at the boundary of the direct - indirect gap transition of the energy bands .",
    "in fact , it is not accidental , which is closely related to the strain - modulated electronic structure ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s5 ) . for bp under no strain , the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) sit at @xmath96 , leaving a @xmath97 direct band gap .",
    "if a strain is applied , e.g. , along the @xmath12 direction , one may observe that when the tensile strain increases , the cbm at @xmath96 ascends and the conduction band between @xmath98 and @xmath96 points descends concurrently , and align in energy at the strain of @xmath85 ; eventually the conduction band between @xmath98 and @xmath96 points becomes the new cbm and induces an indirect band gap .",
    "in other words , in the direct - indirect gap transition under a strain , two or more conduction bands ( valence bands ) will converge and then depart , i.e. , the degeneracy of energy valleys is increased at the transition point . note that the `` multiple valleys '' are reported as one of the most important factors in the improvement of te properties @xcite .",
    "thus , the connection between the direct - indirect band gap transition and the _ zt _ value enhancement is clear .",
    "although the `` multiple valleys '' are not always accompanied by a direct - indirect gap transition , the latter can increase the degeneracy of energy valleys . from this observation",
    ", we find that the direct - indirect gap transition can act as a pointer of the multiple valleys and the enhancement of te properties regardless of the reason for such a transition , which may be useful for searching for the good te materials .    in summary",
    ", we systematically investigated the geometric , electronic , and te properties of bulk bp under strain , and found that bp could be as a potential te material .",
    "it is revealed that bulk bp possesses many interesting and unexpected geometric properties , such as hinge - like structures , anisotropic young s modulus , and negative poisson s ratio .",
    "bp can transit among metal , direct and indirect semiconductors under a strain , showing a sensitive electronic structure that could lead to diverse modulation possibilities .",
    "the te performance of bp is anisotropic , where the maximal _ zt _ value is found to be 0.72 along the @xmath12 direction at @xmath0 , indicating bp may be a potential @xmath13-type medium - high temperature te material .",

    "zt _ of bp effectively , and the _ zt _ value is enhanced to 0.87 at a tensile strain along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "interestingly , most enhancements of the te performance of bp happen to emerge at the boundary of the direct - indirect transition of the energy bands , which may be attributed to the increase of the degeneracy of energy valleys at the transition point .",
    "the direct - indirect gap transition can play a role as an indicator of the multiple valleys and the enhancement of te properties . by comparing the structure of bp with snse , a family of potential te materials with structures similar to bp and snse are suggested .",
    "this present study not only presents various unexpected properties of bp , but also gives hints that could be applied to enhance the te effect of a material .",
    "the first - principles dft calculations are performed using the projector augmented wave method @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite for the exchange - correlation potential as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( ` vasp ` ) code@xcite . the kinetic energy cutoff of wave functions is @xmath99 , and a monkhorst - pack @xcite @xmath100-mesh of @xmath101 is adopted to sample the inreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) , with the energy convergence threshold set as @xmath102 .",
    "_ van der waals _ interaction is taken into account at the vdw - df level with optb88 for exchange functional ( optb88-vdw)@xcite . both the cell shape and volume are fully optimized and all atoms are allowed to relax until the maximal hellmann - feynman force acting on each atom is less than @xmath103 . as the exact band gap is important for the accurate prediction of the te transport properties@xcite , the electronic structures are calculated at modified becke - johnson ( mbj ) @xcite level .",
    "once the full electronic band structures are obtained with dense enough k - points sampled in the first brillouin zone , several te properties , such as thermopower ( @xmath2 ) , electrical conductivity ( @xmath3 ) and electrical thermal conductivity ( @xmath104 ) can be derived using the semi - classical boltzmann transport theory as implemented in the ` boltztrap ` code@xcite , which has been shown to provide a good description of te properties in a variety of te materials.@xcite note that several approximations are involved in the above method .",
    "as the band structures are calculated at zero temperature , the broadening of fermi distribution has been utilized to introduce the effect of temperature@xcite .",
    "rigid band approximation @xcite is employed that doping could be simulated by simply shifting up ( @xmath13-type ) or down ( @xmath44-type ) the chemical potential based on the undoped band structures , which means that only low level doping could be treated properly . besides , the constant scattering time ( @xmath105 ) approximation is adopted to ignore the @xmath100 and @xmath18-dependence of the scattering time @xmath105 , but it still can be varying for different materials or different directions in the same material .",
    "in fact , the directly obtained ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath104 from ` boltztrap ` code are expressed as the ratios of electrical conductivity , electrical thermal conductivity to the scattering time @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the figure of merit__zt _ _ could be rewritten as @xmath108 hence , to obtain _ zt _ , we still need to know @xmath109 .",
    "for such an anisotropic material bp , it has been reported @xcite that there exists a contradiction of the ratio of mobility to reciprocal effective mass between the experiment and the results obtained with a simple consideration that the scattering times are comparable among the crystal directions .",
    "hence the anisotropy of @xmath105 is necessary to be considered . from the semiconductor theory @xcite",
    ", the carrier s scattering time @xmath105 could be derived from the relation @xmath110 , where @xmath64 is the carrier mobility , @xmath111 is the effective mass of carrier , and @xmath112 is the elementary charge . with @xmath64 and @xmath111 along",
    "different lattice directions for both electron ( @xmath13-type ) and hole ( @xmath44-type ) doped bp extracted from the experiment @xcite , the anisotropic @xmath105 for bp can be evaluated ( see supplemental table s3 ) .",
    "for the lattice thermal conductivity ( @xmath8 ) , which could be derived in principle by considering the phonon dispersions and two - phonon or even higher order scattering mechanisms , we here take into account the influence of @xmath8 to the te performance of bp through a more practical approach : consider an inverse temperature dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity ( @xmath8 ) that exists in a large number of materials @xcite , we could simply assume that @xmath113 also for bp . with the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath114 obtained from the experiment @xcite , the @xmath115 for other higher temperatures could be derived using the reciprocal relation of @xmath8 to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the @xmath109 can be calculated .",

    "<S> thermoelectric ( te ) materials can perform a direct solid - state conversion from thermal to electrical energy or vice versa , and have a number of valuable applications , such as thermoelectric generators , waste heat recovery , thermoelectric cooling and heating devices @xcite , etc . , which thus may make crucial contributions to the crisis of energy and environment . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the te performance and efficiency are characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are seebeck coefficient ( thermopower ) , electrical conductivity , absolute temperature and thermal conductivity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity ( @xmath6 ) consists of those from electrons ( @xmath7 ) and phonons ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite accordingly , a higher _ zt _ value at a given temperature requires a high thermopower , a suitable combination of electrical conductivity and electrical thermal conductivity ( both related to carrier mobility ) , and a low lattice thermal conductivity .    among the known te materials , bi@xmath9te@xmath10 and bi@xmath9se@xmath10 perform the best at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> they are narrow band - gap semiconductors with layered structures , and have a high electrical conductivity in combination with a low thermal conductivity , resulting in a high _ zt _ value . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite recently , another layered material , snse , has been reported to have an unprecedented high _ zt _ value of 2.6 at @xmath11 along a specific lattice direction.@xcite a closer inspection indicates that both bi@xmath9te@xmath10 ( bi@xmath9se@xmath10 ) and snse share the similar layered structures . </S>",
    "<S> it thus reminds us that a high _ zt _ value along some specific lattice directions may emerge in the layered anisotropic materials . </S>",
    "<S> such a speculation motivates us to reexamine the te performance of black phosphorus ( bp ) that has an almost the same hexagonal layered structure as snse except the lowered symmetry of snse crystal ( supplemental fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) , because for each layer , bp and snse bear a nearly identical hinge - like structure , which may lead to a high electrical conductivity and a low lattice thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite bp was also found to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a high carrier mobility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , few - layer bp ( the single layer bp is called phosphorene ) , which possesses the layered hexagonal structure similar to graphene but puckered , has been successfully mechanically exfoliated recently @xcite , thereby stimulating a number of works in short time @xcite , which also attracts much interest in once ignored bulk bp . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have promised that a strain engineering could modulate or even enhance the te performance of relevant materials . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite hence , it is worth to study the te performance of bulk bp , especially under a strain .    in this paper , by combining the density functional theory ( dft ) first - principles calculations and the semi - classical boltzmann transport theory , we systematically investigated geometric , electronic , and te properties of bulk bp under a strain . </S>",
    "<S> a number of unexpected and interesting results are disclosed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the hinge - like structure of bp brings unusual mechanical response properties , such as the anisotropic young s modulus and negative poisson s ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of bp is observed being sensitive to a strain , as it can transform among phases of metal , direct and indirect semiconductors under a proper strain . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal _ zt _ value of bp is found to be 0.72 along the @xmath12 direction at @xmath0 , and can be enhanced to 0.87 by a proper strain , indicating that bp could be a potential @xmath13-type medium - high temperature te material . </S>",
    "<S> the strain can be applied as an effective means to enhance te properties . </S>",
    "<S> such strain - induced enhancements are observed to occur often at the boundary of the direct - indirect band gap transition , which can be attributed to the increase of degeneracy of energy valleys at the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> the direct - indirect transition can act as a pointer of the multiple valleys and the enhancement of te properties . on the basis of comparing bp with snse , a family of potential good te materials with the structure similar to bp and snse are predicted .     </S>",
