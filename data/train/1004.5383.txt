    "most modern higher - dimensional theories venturing beyond the standard model of particle physics contain the fairly generic feature that the low - energy fundamental constants should vary with time .",
    "the detection of such changes opens up an avenue to probe basic physics , especially important because other predictions of these models tend to lie at unattainably high energies ( @xmath10  gev ) .",
    "tests of such low - energy predictions of these models , such as changes in the constants , violation of the equivalence principles , etc , may provide the only means of distinguishing between different unified theories and are hence of much importance in physics .",
    "astrophysical techniques can be used to probe changes in fundamental constants like the fine structure constant @xmath1 , the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath11 and the proton gyromagnetic ratio @xmath3 , over a large fraction of the age of the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite applied one such technique ( the `` many - multiplet method '' ; @xcite ) to high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) data from the keck telescope to obtain @xmath12}}}= ( -5.7 \\pm 1.1 ) \\times 10^{-6}$ ] from 143  absorbers at @xmath13 , i.e. suggesting a smaller value of @xmath1 at earlier times ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result has not so far been confirmed with independent data on smaller samples from the ultraviolet echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the very large telescope ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite used redshifted molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath14 ) lines to place strong constraints on changes in @xmath4 , obtaining @xmath15}}}= ( -2.6 \\pm 3.0 )   \\times 10^{-6}$ ] from three absorbers at @xmath16 . note that these results are all based on optical spectra , where wavelength calibration , line blending , intrinsic velocity offsets , isotopic abundances , interloping absorbers , etc , are all possible sources of systematic error , ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "further , the quoted errors in the result of @xcite do not include effects from systematic distortions in the hires wavelength calibration @xcite ; similar , but smaller , distortions have also been found in the wavelength scale of the vlt - uves spectrograph @xcite .    given the possibility that underestimated or unknown systematics might dominate the errors from a given technique , it is important that independent techniques , with entirely different systematics , be used to test for changes in the constants .",
    "it is also crucial to probe evolution at all timescales , as the timescales of the putative changes are entirely unknown .",
    "redshifted radio oh lines provide an independent approach to study changes in @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in rare cases , the satellite oh  18 cm lines ( at rest frequencies of 1612.230825 ( 15 )  mhz and 1720.529887 ( 10 )  mhz ; @xcite ) are `` conjugate '' to each other ; i.e. the lines have the same shapes , but one line is in absorption and the other in emission .",
    "this masing effect arises due to the quantum mechanical selection rules for decay routes to the @xmath17 ( j = 3/2 )  oh ground state , after the molecules have been pumped to higher excited rotational states @xcite .",
    "crucially , the conjugate behavior _ ensures that the satellite lines arise from the same gas_. these lines are thus well - suited for measuring changes in @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 between the source redshift and today , as systematic velocity offsets between the lines are ruled out by the maser mechanism . any observed difference between the line redshifts",
    "must then arise due to a change in one or more of the above constants @xcite .    only two conjugate oh systems are known at cosmological distances , at @xmath18 towards pks  1413 + 135  @xcite and at @xmath19 towards pmn  j0134@xmath200931  @xcite .",
    "we report here on deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and arecibo telescope ( ao ) oh observations of pks  1413 + 135 , that yield tentative evidence for changes in @xmath1 , @xmath4 and/or @xmath3 over a lookback time of @xmath8  gyr .",
    "the wsrt and the ao were used to carry out deep integrations on the satellite oh lines of pks  1413 + 135  between may and july  2005 ( wsrt ; @xmath21  hours ) and june  2008 and may  2009 ( ao ; @xmath22  hours in double - position - switched mode ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 1720  mhz and 1612  mhz lines were observed simultaneously in all runs , with velocity resolutions of @xmath23  km / s ( ao ) and @xmath24  km / s ( wsrt ) , after hanning smoothing .",
    "the wsrt data were analysed in `` classic '' aips , while the arecibo data were analysed in idl , both using standard procedures .",
    "the top four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] and [ b ] show the satellite oh  18 cm optical depth spectra from each telescope , with the 1720  mhz spectrum flipped in sign for the comparison .",
    "the wsrt spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] have root - mean - square ( rms ) optical depth noise values of @xmath25  ( 1612 ) and @xmath26  ( 1720 ) , per @xmath24  km / s channel , while the corresponding rms noise values for the ao spectra of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1][b ] are @xmath27  ( 1612 ) and @xmath28  ( 1720 ) , per @xmath23  km / s channel .",
    "the bottom panels of the figure show the sum of the 1612 and 1720  mhz optical depth profiles from each telescope .",
    "the rms noise values on the summed spectra are @xmath29 per @xmath24  km / s channel ( wsrt ) and @xmath30 per @xmath23  km / s channel ( ao ) , consistent with the noise levels on the individual spectra .",
    "the summed spectra also show no evidence for non - gaussian structure ; indeed , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) rank-1 test finds that the summed spectra are consistent ( at @xmath31 significance ) with being drawn from normal distributions .",
    "the satellite oh lines are thus conjugate at the signal - to - noise ratio of our observations .    having",
    "confirmed that the satellite lines are conjugate within our measurement errors , the next step is to test whether they arise at the same redshift . for lines that are not conjugate ,",
    "this is usually done by fitting gaussians ( or voigt profiles ) to each line , to measure the redshift of peak absorption ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of the wsrt and ao spectra",
    ", a three - component gaussian model provides a good fit to each spectrum , yielding noise - like residuals .",
    "however , the process of fitting multiple spectral components to a spectral line of shape can itself affect the results , especially in the case of complex profiles .",
    "an important advantage of using conjugate satellite oh lines to probe fundamental constant evolution is that the shapes of the lines are known to be the same .",
    "one can thus directly determine the peak of the cross - correlation of the two lines , instead of having to decompose each profile into its components .",
    "the cross - correlation of the two wsrt satellite oh spectra was found to peak at @xmath32  km / s , and that of the ao spectra at @xmath33  km / s .",
    "the rms noise values were estimated by cross - correlating @xmath34 pairs of simulated spectra .",
    "each simulated spectrum was obtained by adding independent representations of gaussian random noise to the best 3-component fit , with the noise spectra characterized by the rms values of the observed spectra .",
    "a weighted average of the wsrt and ao results gives a net velocity offset of @xmath35  km / s between the two satellite lines , with the 1720  mhz line at a higher velocity .",
    "note that the sum of the optical depth spectra might be expected to approach zero more closely ( i.e. to be more `` noise - like '' ) on applying the measured offset between the line profiles . at present ,",
    "the fact that the measured offset is smaller than a pixel ( @xmath36 half a pixel for the arecibo spectra ) implies that this test is not very sensitive , especially because the offset is detected at relatively low statistical significance . note , further , that a k - s test finds that the summed optical depth spectra , obtained without applying the velocity offset , are consistent with noise ( at @xmath31 significance ) .",
    "however , we did carry out the above test on the higher - sensitivity arecibo spectra , and found , as expected , that no statistically - significant difference is apparent in either the mean or the rms noise of the summed spectrum , on applying the measured velocity offset before carrying out the sum .",
    "finally , we emphasize that this would be a useful test to carry out on higher - sensitivity , higher - resolution data , to test for an offset of multiple pixels .",
    "this test would also verify that the two lines indeed have precisely the same shape , thus complementing the cross - correlation technique , which formally only measures the offset between the two profiles , assuming that they have the same shape .",
    "the above agreement between the shapes ( amplitudes and widths ) of the satellite lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and the offset between the line redshifts is precisely the signature of an evolution in the fundamental constants that was being sought .",
    "using the equations of @xcite , the velocity offsets measured in the cross - correlation analysis yield @xmath37}= ( -1.9 \\pm 1.1 ) \\times 10^{-5}$ ] for the wsrt spectra , and @xmath37}= ( -1.03 \\pm 0.51 ) \\times 10^{-5}$ ] for the ao spectra , where @xmath38^{1.85}$ ] .",
    "a weighted average of the wsrt and ao results gives @xmath37}= ( -1.18 \\pm 0.46 ) \\times 10^{-5}$ ] .",
    "this is weak ( @xmath39 ) evidence for a change in @xmath1 , @xmath4 and/or @xmath3 , from the redshift of pks  1413 + 135  to the present epoch , i.e. over 2.9  gyrs .",
    "we also carried out a similar cross - correlation analysis on the strong conjugate satellite oh lines from the nearby extra - galactic source cen.a @xcite , to test whether velocity offsets between the satellite lines are seen in local conjugate systems .",
    "the analysed oh spectra towards this source were kindly provided to us by huib van langevelde .",
    "the peak of the cross - correlation for the cen.a spectra was found to be at @xmath40  km / s , consistent with no velocity offset between the lines .",
    "this demonstrates that the conjugate satellite technique provides the expected null result for at least one local system , and at a sensitivity comparable to that of the datasets towards pks  1413 + 135 .",
    "systematic effects that might contribute to increased errors , above those determined from the cross - correlation analysis , stem from two possible sources .",
    "`` local '' issues that could result in an observed offset include errors in the telescope frequency scale , doppler - tracking issues , terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , etc .",
    "however , both the wsrt and ao data were recorded in topocentric frequency , with no corrections made for earth motion during the observations .",
    "these corrections were applied during the data analysis , using a model of earth motion accurate to @xmath41  m / s , an order of magnitude lower than our measurement errors .",
    "frequency calibration is also not usually an issue in radio spectroscopy , with the frequency scale set by the accuracy of masers and local oscillators ( typically a few  hz , two orders of magnitude lower than our errors ) .",
    "the laboratory oh frequencies are known to an accuracy of @xmath42  hz @xcite , again far smaller than our errors .",
    "finally , there is no evidence for non - gaussian structure in the baselines of the different spectra , that might limit their dynamic range .",
    "the only `` local '' source of systematic error in this technique thus appears to be rfi ; the wsrt and ao data were carefully edited and there was no evidence of residual rfi in any of the spectra .",
    "further , note that a consistent velocity offset between the satellite lines is found in both the wsrt and ao spectra , although the two datasets were acquired with telescopes on different continents and at different times ; this makes it very unlikely that the offset might be caused by rfi .",
    "another category of systematics consists of `` astronomical '' effects that might cause intrinsic velocity offsets between the two lines ( e.g. different `` clouds '' excited in each line , source inhomogeneities , an interloping line from a different transition , etc ) .",
    "however , unlike in the optical regime , there is no possibility of `` confusing '' lines from pks  1413 + 135  or an interloper along the line of sight .",
    "all possible line interlopers at these frequencies are weak and only detectable in very high hi column density gas , requiring a sightline through a galaxy .",
    "the relatively - large ao beam intersects three known galaxies , the milky way , the host galaxy of pks  1413 + 135  ( at @xmath43 ) and sdss  j141557.20 + 131851.2 , a galaxy at @xmath44 ; there are no transitions from any of these redshifts that might be blended with the oh satellite lines . for example , the nearest known galactic lines are those of ch@xmath14chcn , at a frequency of @xmath45  mhz , @xmath46  mhz away from the redshifted 1720  mhz frequency , while the closest known lines from @xmath43 are those of ch@xmath47ocho , @xmath48  mhz away from the redshifted 1612  mhz line frequency .",
    "finally , we note that the separation between transitions from different oh isotopes at these frequencies is @xmath49  mhz , much larger than our observing bandwidth .    the strongest argument against intrinsic velocity offsets ,",
    "rfi , or additional spectral lines , playing a significant role is the fact that the shapes of the satellite lines are in excellent agreement , in both wsrt and ao datasets .",
    "this is a crucial difference between the present technique , based on the conjugate satellite oh lines , and other approaches . here",
    ", the observed lines themselves provide a stringent test of their use as a probe of fundamental constant evolution : the maser mechanism giving rise to the lines @xcite implies that _ the line shapes must agree _ if they arise in the same gas .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the satellite line shapes only agree at our present sensitivity .",
    "an additional weak spectral component might be present in one of the two spectra , below our detection threshold ; this could result in the cross - correlation peak being offset from zero velocity , while retaining the conjugate behaviour .",
    "while we can not as yet formally rule out this possibility , it should be emphasized that this can easily be tested by deeper spectra in the satellite oh lines .",
    "if the observed ( @xmath39 significance ) offset between the satellite lines is not caused by a `` hidden '' spectral component ( or rfi ) below our sensitivity threshold , it could be evidence for changes in one or more of @xmath1 , @xmath4 , or @xmath3 . note that the conjugate satellite technique is directly sensitive to changes in @xmath38^{1.85}$ ] , and",
    "can not provide additional information on which constant is changing .",

    ".    changes in @xmath3 are expected to be far smaller than those in @xmath4 and @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "other sensitive astronomical techniques to probe fundamental constant evolution include those based on the many - multiplet method @xcite , h@xmath14 lines @xcite , h  i  21 cm and oh lines @xcite , inversion and rotational lines @xcite , h  i  21 cm and ultraviolet carbon lines @xcite , etc .",
    "all of these are affected by systematic effects of different types ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently shown that keck - hires spectra are affected by wavelength calibration errors of unknown origin ; the effect of these systematic errors on the many - multiplet result of @xcite is not known , although it seems clear that the error budget will increase .",
    "similar problems have been found with vlt - uves spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , which would affect the h@xmath14 results of @xcite .",
    "the importance of the conjugate satellite oh technique stems from the fact that it has fewer systematic effects than other approaches and allows a test of its own applicability , in the prediction that the shapes of the satellite oh lines must be the same .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the expected null result is obtained on applying the technique to a local conjugate satellite system , cen.a .",
    "equally important , and again unlike most other techniques , the conjugate satellite lines allow an estimate of changes in the fundamental constants from a _ single space - time location _ , without any averaging over multiple absorbers ( which , for example , is essential in the many - multiplet method to average out local systematics ) .",
    "the only apparent drawback to the technique is the possibility of rfi at the line frequencies ; this can be ameliorated by using multiple telescopes , as done here , or multiple observing epochs , taking advantage of the shift in the line frequency in the terrestrial frame due to the motion of the earth around the sun .    in summary",
    ", we have obtained deep wsrt and arecibo telescope spectra in the redshifted satellite oh  18 cm lines from pks  1413 + 135 , at @xmath0 .",
    "the lines are conjugate at our sensitivity , with the sum of the optical depths consistent with noise .",
    "we find that the peak of the cross - correlation of the satellite oh  18 cm lines is offset from zero velocity ( at @xmath39 significance ) , tentative evidence for a redshift offset between them .",
    "we have examined the data for systematic effects and find no evidence that such effects might give rise to the observed velocity offset .",
