    "random surfaces appearing in various models of integrable probability , such as random matrices and random tilings , are known to have a rich structure . a particular feature , one that has received much attention in recent years , is the gaussian free field that is expected to appear as a universal field describing the global fluctuations of such random surfaces . using the integrable structure ,",
    "this has been rigorously verified in a number of models in the literature . for a partial list of reference",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the results so far indicate the universality of the gaussian free field in this context is rather robust . in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the global fluctuations for a particular class of models , namely that of non - colliding processes and ensembles of non - intersecting paths .",
    "for those models , we will provide a general principle that leads to gaussian free field type fluctuations .",
    "non - colliding process and non - intersecting path ensembles form an important class of two dimensional random interacting systems .",
    "for instance , dyson showed @xcite that the gaussian unitary ensemble is the invariant measure for a system of non - colliding ornstein - uhlenbeck processes . replacing the ornstein - uhlenbeck process by its radially",
    "squared version defines a similar stochastic dynamics for the laguerre unitary ensemble @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "example ] we will recall a generalization to non - colliding processes for which the classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles ( continuous and discrete ) are the invariant measures . another source of models that lead non - intersecting paths are random tilings of planar domains .",
    "lozenge tilings of a hexagon on a triangular lattice , for example , can alternatively be described by discrete random walks that start and end at opposite sites of the hexagon @xcite . in that way , a probability measure on all tilings of the hexagon induces a non - intersecting path ensemble .    by the tandem of the karlin - mcgregor or gessel - lindstrm - viennot theorem and the eynard - mehta theorem",
    ", it follows that many non - colliding process are determinantal point processes , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this makes them especially tractable for asymptotic analysis .",
    "a natural way to study the random surfaces appearing in this way is to analyze linear statistics for such determinantal point processes . _",
    "the purpose of this paper is to prove central limit theorems for multi - time or multi - layer linear statistics for a certain class of determinantal point processes . _",
    "the conditions under which the results hold are easily verified in the classical ensembles . in particular",
    ", we will show that this central limit theorem confirms the universality conjecture for the gaussian free field in these models .",
    "we will illustrate our results by considering several examples , including dynamic extension of unitary ensembles and other ensembles related to ( bi)orthogonal polynomials .",
    "+ in the remaining part of the introduction we give an example of what type of results we will prove by discussing a well - known model .",
    "consider the left picture as shown in figure [ fig : bb ] showing @xmath0 brownian bridges @xmath1 that start for @xmath2 at the origin and return there at @xmath3 .",
    "we also condition the bridges never to collide .",
    "the @xmath4 turn out to have the same distribution as the ordered eigenvalues of an @xmath5 hermitian matrix for which the real and imaginary part of each entry independently ( up to the symmetry ) performs a brownian bridge . hence , at any given time @xmath6 the locations @xmath4 have the exact same distribution of the appropriately scaled eigenvalues of a matrix taken randomly from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( = gue ) .",
    "for more details and background on this , by now classical , example we refer to @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a general reference on random matrix theory .",
    "because of the non - colliding condition , we can view the paths as level lines for a random surface .",
    "more precisely , if we define the height function by @xmath7 i.e. @xmath8 counts the number of paths directly below a given point @xmath9 , then the trajectories are the lines where the stepped surface defined by the graph of @xmath8 makes a jump by one .",
    "the question is what happens with @xmath10 when the size of the system grows large , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that as @xmath11 the normalized height function @xmath12 has an almost sure limit , also called the limit shape . indeed , when @xmath11 the paths will all accumulate on a region @xmath13 that is usually referred to as the disordered region .",
    "we will assume that the original system is rescaled such that @xmath13 does not depend on @xmath0 and is a non - empty open domain in @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , after a proper rescaling , the domain @xmath13 is the ellipse @xmath15 it is well - known that the eigenvalue distribution of a gue matrix converges to that of a semi - circle law ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that we have the following limit for the height function @xmath16 the next question is about the fluctuations of the random surface , i.e. the behavior of @xmath17 . for a fixed point @xmath9",
    "we note that @xmath8 is a counting statistic counting the number of eigenvalues of a suitably normalized gue matrix in a given semi - infinite interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the variance for such a statistic is known to be growing logarithmically @xmath19 as @xmath11 . moreover , by dividing by the variance we find that @xmath20 as @xmath11 . the principle behind this result goes back to costin - lebowitz @xcite and",
    "was later extended by soshnikov @xcite . however ,",
    "if we consider the correlation between several points that are macroscopically far apart , @xmath21,\\ ] ] we obtain a finite limit as @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath22 the random surface defined by the graph of @xmath23 converges to a rough surface .",
    "the pointwise limit does not make sense ( due to the growing variance ) but it has a limit as a generalized function .",
    "this generalized function is , up to coordinate transform , known in the literature as the gaussian free field .",
    "since the gaussian free field is a random generalized function , it is natural to pair it with a test function @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 ( as we will show in section [ sec : gff ] the dirichlet pairing is more appropriate , also including a coordinate transform , but this simpler pairing does show the essential idea ) . then by writing @xmath26}(x)$ ] and by a discretization of the time",
    "integral we obtain @xmath27 where we choose @xmath28 time points @xmath29",
    "such that @xmath30 and typically want the mesh @xmath31 to be small .",
    "the fact of the matter is that the right - hand side is a _ linear statistic _ for the point process on @xmath32 defined by the locations @xmath33 in other words , the pairing in naturally leads us to studying linear statistics @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 for a function @xmath36 on @xmath37 .",
    "the central question of the paper is to ask for the limiting behavior , as @xmath11 , of the fluctuations of @xmath38 for sufficiently smooth functions @xmath36 .",
    "a particular consequence of the main results is the following .",
    "[ prop : intro ] let @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is continuously differentiable and grows at most polynomially for @xmath41 .",
    "then the linear statistic for the point process satisfies @xmath42 as @xmath11 , where @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "this central limit theorem is a special case of a more general theorem that we will state in the next section .",
    "the main point of the present paper is to show that such results follow from a general principle for models that have a determinantal structure for which the integrating functions ( i.e. the hermite polynomials in the above example ) satisfy a finite term recurrence .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop : intro ] will be discussed in example [ eq : ou ] ( see also @xcite for a similar statement in the context of stochastic evolutions for wigner matrices ) .",
    "the precise connection to the gaussian free field will be explained in section [ sec : gff ] .      in section [ sec :",
    "mainresults ] we will formulate the model that we will consider and state our main results , including various corollaries . the proofs of those corollaries will also be given in section [ sec : mainresults ] , but the proofs of the main results , theorem  [ th : main0 ] ,  [ th : extend ] ,  [ th : main0growing ] and  [ th : extendgrowing ] will be given in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "our approach is a connection to recurrence matrices , which will be explained in section [ sec : rec ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : fred ] we will analyze the asymptotic behavior of a general fredholm determinant from which the proofs of the main results are special cases .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : example ] we will provide ample examples to illustrate our results .",
    "in this section we will discuss the general model that we will consider and state our main results .",
    "some proofs are postponed to later sections .",
    "determinantal point processes that come from non - colliding process and non - intersecting paths have a particular form . in this paper",
    ", we will therefore consider probability measures on @xmath47 that can be written as the product of several determinants , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a normalizing constant , @xmath50 are borel measures on @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath54 is such that the integral operator @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 is a bounded operator .",
    "the form of may look very special at first , but it appears often when dealing with non - colliding processes and non - intersecting paths .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the key is the karlin - mcgregor theorem in the continuous setting or the gessel - lindstrm - viennot theorem in the discrete setting , that say that the transition probabilities of non - colliding processes can be expressed as determinants of a matrix constructed out of the transition probability for a single particle",
    ". we will discuss several explicit examples in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "it is standard that without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath57 for @xmath58 . to show this ,",
    "we first recall andreif s identity : for any measure @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 we have @xmath62 then , by iterating , we see that @xmath49 can be expressed as the determinant of the gram - matrix associated to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 since @xmath49 can not vanish , it means that gram - matrix is non - singular .",
    "the fact of the matter is that by linearity of the determinant , we can replace the @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s in the determinants in by any other linear combinations of those functions , as long as the resulting family is linearly independent .",
    "a particular choice , for example by using the singular value decomposition of the original gram - matrix , is to make sure that the new gram - matrix becomes the identity . in other words , without loss of generality we can assume that we @xmath66 and @xmath67 are such that holds .",
    "this also shows that in that case @xmath68 .",
    "an important role in the analysis is played by the functions @xmath69 for @xmath70 , where @xmath71 stands for the adjoint of @xmath72 which is given by @xmath73 note that it follows from that @xmath74 for @xmath58 and @xmath70 .",
    "the marginals in for the points @xmath75 for a fixed @xmath76 are given by the measure @xmath77 a probability measure of this type is known in the literature as a biorthogonal ensemble @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that , by the eynard - mehta theorem , measures of the form are examples of determinantal point processes .",
    "we recall that a determinantal point process is a point process for which the @xmath78-point correlation functions can be written as @xmath79 determinants constructed out of a single function of two variables , called the correlation kernel .",
    "more precisely , there exists a @xmath80 such that for any test function @xmath81 we have @xmath82\\\\ = \\sum_{\\ell=0 } ^\\infty \\int_{\\lambda^\\ell } g(\\eta_1 ) \\cdots g(\\eta_\\ell ) \\det \\left(k_{n , n}(\\eta_i,\\eta_j)\\right)_{i , j=1}^\\ell   { \\rm d } \\nu(\\eta_1 ) \\cdots { \\rm d } \\nu(\\lambda_\\ell),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath59 is a measure on @xmath84 , called the reference measure . for the point process defined by this kernel has the form @xmath85 with reference measure @xmath86 . here @xmath87 stands for the integral kernel for the integral operator @xmath88 for more details and background on determinantal point process for extended kernels we refer to @xcite .    for a determinantal point process",
    ", all information is in one way or the other encoded in the correlation kernel . for that reason ,",
    "a common approach to various results for determinantal point processes goes by an analysis of the kernel and its properties .",
    "however , in this paper we use an alternative approach for analyzing the global fluctuations .",
    "we follow the idea of @xcite and assume that the biorthogonal families admit a recurrence .    [ assumption ] we assume that @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be extended to families @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that the functions defined by@xmath93 for @xmath70 , have the properties    1 .",
    "biorthogonality : @xmath94 for @xmath95 2 .",
    "recursion : for each @xmath96 there is a _ banded _",
    "matrix @xmath97 such that @xmath98    we will denote the bandwidth by @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 we will assume that @xmath99 does not depend on @xmath76 or @xmath0 ( but @xmath101 may also depend on @xmath0 ) .",
    "note that and the banded structure of @xmath97 means that the functions @xmath102 satisfy finite term recurrence relation @xmath103 the number of terms in the recurrence equals the number of non - trivial diagonals , which is at most @xmath104 . also note that by biorthogonality we have @xmath105 finally , we mention that although the arguments in this paper can likely by adjusted to allow for a varying bandwidth ( but keeping the bandwidth uniformly bounded in @xmath106 ) , in the relevant examples we always have a fixed bandwidth independent of @xmath107 .",
    "an important special class of examples that we will study in this paper is when the biorthogonal families are related to orthogonal polynomials .",
    "if each @xmath108 has finite moments , then we can define @xmath109 as the polynomial of degree @xmath110 with positive leading coefficient such that @xmath111 as we will see in section [ sec : example ] in many examples we end up with a measure with @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for some coefficients @xmath115 . in that case",
    ", we find @xmath116 such examples satisfy assumption [ assumption ] . indeed",
    ", it is classical that the orthogonal polynomials satisfy a three - term recurrence @xmath117 for coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this recurrence can be written as @xmath120 the matrix @xmath121 is then a symmetric tridiagonal matrix containing the recurrence coefficients , also called the jacobi matrix / operator associated to @xmath122 .",
    "it is not hard to check that in this situation , assumption [ assumption ] is satisfied with @xmath123    we stress that such a recurrence relation is not special for orthogonal polynomials only , but appear often in the presence of an orthogonality condition .",
    "for instance , multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles @xcite also appear in the context of non - colliding processes , such as external source models .",
    "multiple orthogonal polynomials satisfy recurrence relations involving more terms then only three , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , note that in the example in the introduction , it was needed to rescale the process as @xmath11 .",
    "this rescaling means that all the parameters will depend on @xmath0 . _",
    "therefore we will allow @xmath108 , @xmath102 and @xmath124 to depend on @xmath0 , but for clarity reasons we will suppress this dependence in the notation .",
    "_      we will study linear statistics for the determinantal point process .",
    "that is , for a function @xmath126 we define @xmath127 where @xmath128 are sampled from a probability measure of the form satisfying assumption [ assumption ] . as we will see , the linear statistics @xmath34 admit a useful representation in terms of the recurrence matrices @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , one of the main points of the paper is that for studying linear statistics , this representation appears to be more convenient than the representation in terms of the correlation kernel @xmath80 . in many interesting examples the asymptotic study of the relevant parts of @xmath97 are trivial , whereas the asymptotic analysis ( in all the relevant regimes ) of the kernel is usually tedious .",
    "the central observation of this paper , is that the fluctuation of the linear statistic depend strongly on just small part of the operators @xmath97 , more precisely , the coefficients @xmath129 for fixed @xmath130 are dominant in the fluctuations for large @xmath0 .",
    "the other coefficients only play a minor role .",
    "two different models for which these coefficients behave similarly , have the same fluctuations .",
    "this is the content of the first main result .",

    "the proof of this theorem will be given in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "this result is a genuine universality result , in the sense that there is no specification of a limit .",
    "if two families of models have the same asymptotic behavior of the recurrence matrices , then the fluctuations are also the same . as a consequence , after computing the limiting behavior for a particular example",
    ", we obtain the same result for all comparable processes .",
    "the natural question is then what the typical behaviors are that one observes in the models of interest . as we will illustrate in section [ sec : gff ] ,",
    "one important example is when the recurrence coefficients have a limiting value or , more precisely , the matrices @xmath141 have limits along the diagonals .",
    "the fluctuations in that case are described by the following theorem .",

    "such that @xmath138 is a polynomial in @xmath139 we have @xmath159 where @xmath160    this directly follows from theorem [ th : main1 ] , the relation and a rewriting of the limiting variance .",
    "for the latter , note that by a rescaling and a symmetry argument can be written as @xmath161 moreover , by @xmath162 and the fact that @xmath163 for @xmath164 , we can symmetrize the limiting variance in theorem [ th : main1 ] to obtain the one in .    as we will see in section [ sec : example ] , theorem [ th : main1 ] and corollary [ cor : th : main1 ] cover several interesting examples .    in case",

    "we start by noting that the jacobian for the map is given by @xmath267 then , by a change of variables we have @xmath268 clearly , since @xmath236 and @xmath241 are each others inverse maps , we have @xmath269 and hence @xmath270    this implies that @xmath271 using integration by parts in the last step .",

    "in this section we will illustrate the main results by discussing several examples .",
    "the first class of examples is that of non - colliding processes for which the classical orthogonal polynomials ensembles are the invariant measures .",
    "the construction we will follow is a well - known approach using doob s @xmath283-transform and the karlin - mcgregor theorem , see e.g. @xcite for a discussion .",
    "an alternative way of defining the processes is to start with a generator for a single particle process and then define an @xmath0-particle process by constructing a generator on the space of symmetric functions  @xcite .",

    "we then construct a markov process on the weyl chamber @xmath295 first we note that by a theorem of karlin - mcgregor it follows , under general conditions on the markov process , that the joint probability distribution for the positions @xmath296 after time @xmath297 of particles that ( 1 ) each perform a single particle process given by @xmath188 , ( 2 ) start at @xmath298 and ( 3 ) are conditioned not to collide in @xmath299 $ ] , is given by @xmath300 then by and it follows that @xmath301 moreover , @xmath302 is positive . hence it is a positive harmonic function and we can apply doob s @xmath283-transform to arrive at the transition function @xmath303 this defines the markov process on @xmath304 that we will be interested in .",
    "finally , it is not hard to show from that the unique invariant measure is given by the orthogonal polynomial ensemble @xcite , @xmath305 in other words , the above construction provides a way for defining a stochastic dynamics for which the classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles are the invariant measures .",
    "we consider this markov process in the stationary situation .",
    "that is , we fix @xmath306 and start the markov process with the invariant measure at @xmath307 .",
    "then we obtain a probability measure for the locations at @xmath189 @xmath308 which , after a symmetrization , is exactly of the form .",
    "in fact it is an example of an orthogonal polynomial situation as given in with @xmath309 .",
    "before we apply corollary [ cor : th : main1 ] we recall that the orthogonal polynomials on the real line are subject to a three term recurrence relation @xmath310 for some numbers @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "we recall that we allow the measure @xmath170 to vary with @xmath0 so that also @xmath313 and @xmath314 may vary with @xmath0 and hence we will write @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",

    "this follows for example after a classical steepest decent analysis on the integral representation of the hermite polynomials or by a riemann - hilbert analysis .",

    "that is , we take @xmath419 random from the probability measure on @xmath420 proportional to @xmath421 where @xmath422 is a polynomial of even degree and positive leading coefficient ( so that the above measure is indeed of finite mass ) .",
    "then if we start the non - colliding ornstein - uhlenbeck process from these initial points and look at the positions @xmath423 at times @xmath424 then we find that the following joint probability for these locations is proportional to @xmath425 where , with @xmath426 , @xmath427 and @xmath428 ( note that we have rescaled space immediately ) .",
    "the functions in the determinant are not in the right form , as assumption [ assumption ] is not yet satisfied .",
    "hence the first thing to do is to rewrite the probability density .",

    "<S> our main assumption is that the point processes are constructed by biorthogonal families that satisfy finite term recurrence relations . </S>",
    "<S> the central observation of the paper is that the fluctuations of multi - time or multi - layer linear statistics can be efficiently expressed in terms of the associated recurrence matrices . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that different models that share the same asymptotic behavior of the recurrence matrices , also share the same asymptotic behavior for the global fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> an important special case is when the recurrence matrices have limits along the diagonals , in which case we prove central limit theorems for the linear statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that these results prove gaussian free field fluctuations for the random surfaces associated to these systems . to illustrate the results , </S>",
    "<S> several examples will be discussed , including non - colliding processes for which the invariant measures are the classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles and random lozenge tilings of a hexagon . </S>"
