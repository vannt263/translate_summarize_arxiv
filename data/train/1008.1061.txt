    "binary pulsar systems manage to reach @xmath7 , while the galactic centre s - stars boast @xmath8 .",
    "this , due to their proximity to the black hole during pericenter passage ( down to @xmath9 of the gravitational radius ) make this class of stars the fastest resolvable ballistic objects known , and allow for the prospect of detecting post - newtonian effects .",
    "the dynamics of the orbit and light trajectories provide an opportunity to test the form of the metric , and in doing so , general relativity .",
    "the kerr metric is the external solution to the einstein field equations for a rotating body .",
    "the geodesics of such a space - time exhibit some well - known features : gravitational time dilation , prograde precession , lensing , and frame - dragging .",
    "gravitational time dilation and precession are orbital effects .",
    "the former due to a temporal stretching , and the latter due to space curvature .",
    "such a curvature also affects photon trajectories  veering the trajectories away from those of straight lines .",
    "each of the these effects contributes to the redshift of the galactic - centre stars in a distinct manner .    these features ,",
    "although markedly distinct , are all due to the same metric .",
    "the post - newtonian formalism , valid provided @xmath10 , allows us to cleanly disentangle these effects , and investigate the detection of each separately .",
    "not only are the stars on post - keplerian orbits , but the photons must travel through spacetime on nontrivial paths before arriving at earth .",
    "this nontrivial path through spacetime affects the time of arrival , and therefore the redshift .    -24pt",
    "the star s orbit can be described by the hamiltonian ( anglil & saha 2010 ) @xmath11    at leading order , the system is spatially invariant , and the star feels no acceleration . at next - to - leading order , gravity debuts .",
    "classically , the potential term is @xmath12 .",
    "gr however demands the modification to @xmath13 , which results in gravitational time - dilation @xmath14 , a consequence of the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "spatially the problem has remained unchanged . however , because the time - dilation term affects the photon arrival times , the redshift is affected .",
    "space curvature enters one order higher .",
    "this is the leading - order schwarzschild term , and causes the orbit to precess .",
    "higher order effects , such as frame - dragging and torquing , we choose not to delve into here .    the hamiltonian governing photon paths , being null , contains a different selection of pre - truncation terms .",
    "@xmath15    at leading order , the trajectories are straight lines .",
    "lensing occurs at @xmath1 via the leading order schwarzschild contribution .",
    "there is no contribution at @xmath16 . for photons , the frame - dragging term debuts at @xmath17 along with higher - order schwarzschild terms , and spin - induced torquing terms . in this work ,",
    "we consider effects only up to @xmath1 for both the null and timelike cases  two orders of magnitude weaker than the schwarzschild photon signal .",
    "it is unlikely that the next generation of instruments will possess the capability to probe such deeper , weaker terms .",
    "we feel morally obligated not to raise the heartbeat of the observer reading this . ] .    -24pt",
    "to calculate the redshift curve of the star , we integrate the star s orbit using timelike solutions to ( [ timelikemetric ] ) , and then , on chosen points along the star s orbit , we find the paths of _ those particular photons emitted by the star which hit the observer _ ( figure [ fig : method ] ) .",
    "to do this , the initial angular momentum of the trajectories ( corresponding to null solutions of [ nullmetric ] ) is varied until the termination position of the photon converges on the observer position . once the trajectories of these photons are known , the redshift may then be calculated directly from the definition :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the proper times of a pair of photons emitted at neighbouring points on the star s orbit , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are their respective arrival times .    -24pt",
    "the redshift curve of a galactic centre star is dependent on a handful of parameters .",
    "these include the keplerian elements , the black hole mass , as well as discrete parameters which toggle the post - newtonian terms .",
    "we proceed as follows . in order to put upper bounds on the spectral resolution required to detect the post - newtonian effects , we generate mock spectral data consisting of 200 data",
    "points with a chosen dispersion , using relativistic terms up to @xmath1 for both the null and timelike metrics , and determine whether or not we are able recover the parameter values by fitting with these effects turned off . for illustrative purposes , we consider an exaggerated s2 orbit . for the semi - major axis , we take @xmath23 . in doing so ,",
    "@xmath24  the classical contribution to the redshift is raised 10-fold .",
    "the redshift due to gravitational time dilation , which enters the dynamics at @xmath0 is increased 100-fold .",
    "the space curvature redshift contribution , entering at @xmath1 , is enhanced 1000-fold .",
