    "the field of molecular electronics has greatly benefited from the possibility of formulating transport problems in the weak - coupling regime as rate equations for sequential tunneling processes.@xcite given the spectrum of the molecule and the tunneling - matrix elements , the different features of the steady - state current  voltage characteristics can immediately be mapped onto the energetic availability or non - availability of certain jump processes .",
    "rate equations are the markovian kinetic equations for the lowest - order expansion of the von neumann equation with respect to the tunneling hamiltonian while neglecting any off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix .",
    "such an approximation is well justified for non - degenerate systems , when the differences of the molecular eigenenergies are much larger than any tunneling - induced level shift or broadening .",
    "as molecules often feature geometric and thus orbital symmetries , the system hamiltonian of a single - molecule junction shows degenerate levels . due to the quantum - mechanical nature of the tunnel junction ,",
    "the rate - equation description is in general inadequate for these systems .",
    "the problem of electronic transport through quantum nanostructures with degenerate levels has already been given some attention in different parts of the literature .",
    "the comprehensive review of markovian master equations by timm @xcite shows the equivalence of different methods and approaches used to derive master equations for weak - coupling problems . in refs .   and",
    ", the coupling of a spin - degenerate quantum dot to ferromagnetic leads causes coherent dynamics described by the full master equation which significantly differ from the spectroscopic picture found in rate - equation treatments .",
    "the problem of using the rate - equation formalism for molecules with orbital symmetries has already been addressed in our previous study on jahn ",
    "teller molecules.@xcite an implementation of the full master - equation formalism for a genuine molecular - electronics problem is discussed in refs .   and",
    ", however , only for a very special and rather complex type of molecule .",
    "the dynamics of a master equation is , in contrast to a rate equation , much less intuitive as the tunneling electrons are allowed to jump into and out of linear superpositions of the degenerate molecular states .",
    "the coupling to the continuum of states in the electronic reservoirs via virtual transitions generates an intrinsic dynamics on the molecule that is not related to real changes of the number of electrons in the system .",
    "the image of the dynamics as a succession of well - defined quantum jumps between the leads and the molecule , which renders the rate equation so simple in its use and tempting for application , is declared void by the quantum mechanical nature of the degenerate system .",
    "the basic phenomenology of quantum transport through nanostructures with orbital degeneracies in the absence of vibrations and in particular the proper derivation of a markovian master equation for the treatment of near - degeneracies has already been investigated by us in ref .  .",
    "there we establish the `` decoupling paradigm '' , which states that for generic tunnel amplitudes , there is always a basis of the molecular hilbert space where one of the ( near-)degenerate levels is decoupled from the drain electrode . below the double - charging threshold , this level is rendered a dark state in which charge is accumulated , and electronic transport across the nanostructure is strongly inhibited .",
    "this coherent current - blockade is only partially lifted due to the tunneling - induced renormalization of the isolated structure s levels , as by transitions via virtual intermediate states in the source electrode , the electron is moved out of the dark state and allowed to tunnel to the drain electrode .",
    "a particularly appealing interpretation of this dynamics uses the picture of a pseudo - spin and the tunneling - induced renormalization as a pseudomagnetic field acting on that pseudo - spin.@xcite    the purpose of this article is the extension and discussion of the model to single - molecule devices , mainly the relation of the physics caused by the orbital degeneracies to the vibronic dynamics of the molecular cage . after having defined the most general model of a linear electron  phonon coupling , we shall show that for the study of degenerate systems this can be reduced to two genuinely different types of molecular models , which significantly differ in their transport properties .",
    "one of them , which we shall term `` anderson  holstein model '' , will simply show a superposition of a vibronic sideband structure and the already known coherent current blockade generic for degenerate electronic systems .",
    "the ratio of charging energy to vibronic energy will be shown to characterize the steady - state current  voltage profile : for large charging energy , the vibronic sidebands will appear as peaks instead of steps and thus render the appearance of negative differential conductance a generic property of single - molecule junctions with degenerate orbitals . the other , a jahn  teller active model , will show a strong dependence of the electronic transport properties on the coupling to the leads .    in the last section",
    ", we shall extend the basic model incorporate elements that are related to possible experimental issues including the modifications of the transport properties due to slight breaking of the orbital degeneracy , general linear electron  phonon coupling , and the presence of many modes in the electronic reservoirs .",
    "not surprisingly , our results will reproduce certain effects and features , which have already been reported by several groups;@xcite what we , however , do want to show is that by using a bottom - up approach and adding complexity to the models in several steps , we succeed in tracing the fundamental and generic physics back to the intrinsic properties of the master equation and are thus in a much better position to actually apply the theory to experiments .",
    "the model of a single - molecule junction , as we consider it in this article , consists of three parts : the single molecule itself , @xmath0 , the source and the drain electrodes through which electrons are injected and extracted , @xmath1 , and a tunnel - coupling between the two , @xmath2 .",
    "the electrodes , @xmath3 being an index for left and right , are modeled as spinless , non - interacting fermi gases , @xmath4 , in the wide - band limit , that is with constant density - of - states @xmath5 .",
    "the molecule , in order to distinguish it from quantum dot systems , is a discrete electronic system coupled to a single vibrational mode.@xcite the electronic part in our model is rather simple .",
    "we consider two degenerate levels that can be detuned from their energy @xmath6 by the gate - voltage of the molecular junction , a coulomb interaction of strength @xmath7 between the two , but no intra - molecular tunneling .",
    "a small energy difference between the two levels of the order of the tunneling - induced level shift can easily be included in the model and the thus resulting derivation of the master equation by application of the singular - coupling limit,@xcite modifies the equation only marginally ; we shall return to this later in section  [ sec : scl ] .",
    "the molecular vibrations are modeled as a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath8 being coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom by @xmath9 specified in the next section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the molecule is thus @xmath10 the two degenerate electronic levels are , in analogy to the notation of spin , labeled @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in case",
    "we have to sum over the different levels , we switch to denoting the levels by @xmath13 and its opposite @xmath14 .",
    "the tunneling part , where from the beginning , we assume the amplitudes @xmath15 to be independent of the electrons wave vector , is @xmath16 for notational convenience , we define a coupling tupel @xmath17 being derived from the respective golden - rule expressions @xmath18 .",
    "the general form of a linear coupling of the oscillator s coordinate to the charge number of a degenerate two - orbital molecule is @xmath19 when the expression for @xmath9 is diagonalized in the space of degenerate electronic levels , which is necessary for the derivation of the master equation , the only non - trivial couplings are those to the excess charge and the charge difference , respectively , @xmath20 the canonical transformation generally used to eliminate the electron ",
    "phonon coupling ",
    "the polaron transformation@xcite  induces a renormalization of the electronic eigenenergies  the polaron shift  which is proportional to the square of the electron  phonon coupling strength .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath11 will thus be renormalized by @xmath21 and the one of @xmath12 by @xmath22 , accordingly .",
    "the hamiltonian in the polaron picture is , however , the starting point for the perturbative analysis of the von neumann equation , and the question , whether we deal with a degenerate , a near - degenerate , or a non - degenerate system refers to this picture and the renormalized energies thereof . in case",
    "the electron ",
    "phonon coupling is assumed to be sufficiently strong , such that the polaron shift is much larger than the tunneling - induced broadening @xmath23 , the system is effectively non - degenerate , and the canonical rate - equation formalism can be applied . if the polaron shift is of the order @xmath23 , the electronic term has to be treated in the singular - coupling limit,@xcite which will be touched briefly in section  [ sec : scl ] . for the setting with strictly degenerate orbitals that we wish to discuss here , the polaron shift of both levels has to be equal , which limits the possible choices of the electron ",
    "phonon coupling in the above expression to either @xmath24 or @xmath25 being zero . for strictly degenerate systems , we thus assume , without loss of generality , @xmath26 choosing the plus sign , we obtain a trivial generalization of the single - mode anderson",
    " holstein hamiltonian.@xcite this choice is therefore termed the `` anderson  holstein molecule '' .",
    "the minus sign , on the contrary , makes the electron - phonon coupling that of an @xmath27 jahn ",
    "teller effect.@xcite we call this model the `` jahn  teller molecule '' .",
    "certain transport properties of jahn  teller systems in the rate - equation regime are analyzed in ref .  .",
    "by absorbing the sign into orbital specific electron ",
    "phonon couplings @xmath28 , the anderson  holstein molecule is defined by @xmath29 , whereas the jahn ",
    "teller case is given when @xmath30 .",
    "the polaron transformation renormalizes not only the single - particle energy @xmath31 but also the charging energy @xmath32 . as in the jahn ",
    "teller case , both orbitals are shifted to opposite directions , occupying such a molecule with two electrons will result in a zero net shift of the adiabatic potential , see figure  [ fig : adiabatic ] .",
    "the renormalization of the charging energy @xmath7 will therefore be positive ; in contrast to the anderson ",
    "holstein model , the jahn  teller molecule induces a repulsive interaction between the two electrons in the polaron picture , not an attractive one.@xcite          as we already know from the treatment of purely electronic structures,@xcite the master equation can be understood best in a coordinate system of the degenerate levels , in which one of them is decoupled from the drain electrode .",
    "then a dark state is formed and causes the stationary current to be strongly suppressed . in the polaron picture , where the tunnel amplitudes are matrix valued",
    ", this property is modified .",
    "consider first the case without electron  phonon coupling .",
    "we apply a unitary transformation in the two - dimensional complex vector space @xmath33 spanned by the operators @xmath34 and  @xmath35 , @xmath36 all parts of the hamiltonian except the tunneling term are invariant under this transformation .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian becomes @xmath37 by choosing suitable angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the second term of one of the above equation vanishes for at least one electrode , allowing the formation of a dark state : the basis of the coherent current blockade as we have explained in ref .  .",
    "under certain circumstances , that is for specific choices of the tunnel - couplings , the hamiltonian can be further simplified . if the condition @xmath40 can be fulfilled for _ every _",
    "@xmath3 , the second term in eq .   will vanish completely and the system will only couple the state @xmath41 to the electrodes , thus reducing it to an effective single - level system with tunneling matrix elements @xmath42 .",
    "this condition reads @xmath43 for all @xmath3 . in the following ,",
    "we shall assume real @xmath15 for simplicity and accordingly set @xmath44 .      in the case of phonons , we have to distinguish the anderson ",
    "holstein and the jahn  teller case . in the polaron picture where the tunnel amplitudes are matrix - valued @xmath45 , the second term of eq .",
    "reads for electrode @xmath3 @xmath46 the electron - phonon coupling of the anderson ",
    "holstein molecule is characterized by the condition @xmath47 thus rendering the term zero . in this model , the decoupling paradigm and the emergence of a dark state works the same way as for purely electronic levels . in the decoupling regime , such a molecule is equivalent to a single - level molecule .",
    "teller molecule , however , has @xmath48 making a detailed discussion of the transition rates necessary .      transforming the molecular hamiltonian into the polaron picture essentially",
    "consists of shifting the adiabatic potential of the oscillator by @xmath49 .",
    "the franck ",
    "condon matrix element @xmath50 at row @xmath51 and column @xmath52 itself is the overlap of the original vibrational state @xmath53 with the shifted oscillator s state @xmath54 .",
    "the modulus of the matrix elements is independent of the direction of the shift , the sign , however , is not .",
    "a transition between states that both have an even or odd number of excited quanta still is independent of the direction . a transition from a state with an even number of quanta to one with an odd number of quanta , however , is sensitive to the direction . in the matrix @xmath55 , only the matrix elements belonging to excitations of an even number of oscillator quanta cancel . in the pre - factor of @xmath41 , the matrix @xmath56 ,",
    "however , there are no cancellations to be expected . only in the case of equal coupling , @xmath57 for all @xmath3 and @xmath58 , the matrix elements for excitations of an odd number of quanta cancel . in that special case , the hamiltonian couples transitions with @xmath59 even to @xmath60 and transitions with @xmath59 odd to @xmath41 .",
    "since the both subsets of transistions change the oscillator s energy by either even or odd multiples of @xmath61 , only , the system decouples into two independent subsystems with disjoint spectra , which in the weak - coupling limit can be treated by rate equations . as simple and tempting",
    "a treatment by rate equations might seem , in this particular case , the rate equation would have two stationary solutions , such that the asymptotic dynamics would strongly depend on the initial state of the system at time @xmath62 .    in the jahn  teller configuration , in contrast to the purely electronic model or the anderson ",
    "holstein molecule , no electronic level can be decoupled completely from a single electrode by a unitary transformation .",
    "as explicated above , only a certain subset of transitions can be decoupled , the others remain with finite transition rates . since this property renders the decoupling paradigm for the jahn ",
    "teller molecule void at first sight , it restricts the current - blockade to the voltage regime below the first vibronic sideband , but in return allows to evaluate the model even in the regime where eq .",
    "[ eq : gr_cond ] is satisfied and the anderson ",
    "holstein model splits up .",
    "in the weak - coupling regime @xmath63 , most transport calculations using rate equations show results , where the coulomb - blockade physics of the electronic levels is augmented by a vibronic structure and the appearance of vibronic sidebands in the current  voltage profile.@xcite significant diversions from this picture only occur in the case of very weak electron ",
    "phonon coupling,@xcite where the vibronic dynamics heat the molecule , or very strong coupling,@xcite where the huge displacement of the oscillators adiabatic potential causes an exponential suppression of the low - bias current  the franck ",
    "condon blockade .    in the presence of two",
    "degenerate electronic levels being described by a master equation for the full reduced density matrix , we expect this paradigm to still hold true .",
    "the coulomb - blockade physics of the electronic structure is enhanced by the coherent current blockade@xcite due to the presence of the dark state .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath64 , we shall observe vibronic sidebands in the form of peaks rather than steps on - top of the profile of the current blockade ( @xmath65 ) or the current blockade modifying the first few vibronic sidebands ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the stationary current for the two generic molecular models shown in figure  [ fig : charge ] corroborates this reasoning . the anderson ",
    "holstein molecule complies well with this argument as the formation of the dark state is not influenced by the vibronic structure . by contrast , the inability of the jahn  teller molecule to completely decouple one electronic level shows up in the modification of the transport properties at the first vibronic sideband only .",
    "the role of the lamb - shift contributions is in general the same as in the purely electronic case , yielding an additional intra - dot tunneling hamiltonian of the form of a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath67 , which connects the two degenerate states via virtual intermediate states in the electronic reservoirs .",
    "the @xmath68-components of these fields in the pseudo - bloch equation for @xmath69 are , due to the symmetry @xmath70 , @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume the electronic bands of the leads to be wide enough to ensure @xmath72 .",
    "all summands vanish simultaneously at @xmath73 , where , similarly to the purely electronic case , the current is completely blocked : @xmath74 .",
    "independently of @xmath7 , there is a contribution of the vibronic excitations to the pseudo - magnetic fields , which goes beyond the purely electronic model . a non - interacting molecule with @xmath75 ,",
    "will still have finite pseudo - magnetic fields as the terms with @xmath76 in equation  ( [ eq : pmf_sq ] ) do not cancel but yield a contribution that is sharply peaked at the vibronic resonances .",
    "this causes slight derivations of the line shape in the differential conductance from the rate - equation result @xmath77 , the derivative of the fermi function .",
    "similarly to the rate - equation treatment , we expect the molecular models to show significant influence of the vibronic structure on the transport properties in the regime of strong electron  phonon coupling.@xcite in figure  [ fig : fcb_ah ] , we show the stationary current of the anderson  holstein model at intermediate electron ",

    "the additional suppression of the stationary current at higher bias is not known from the rate - equation model and due to the intrinsic mechanism of the master equation with coherences .",
    "we have shown previously@xcite and also in this paper that by identifying an exact dark state in the model , we can find the stationary state of the system . if we can find a state that can be populated easily but leaks only very little probability , this state is still a candidate to acquire much population in steady - state and apt to dominate the transport physics . applying this to the large - bias regime of the anderson ",
    "holstein molecule in the franck ",
    "condon blockade yields an explanation for the observed effect .",
    "assume a large charging energy of several @xmath61 and bias and gate voltage chosen such that the singly occupied state is aligned slightly above the drain electrode and the doubly occupied state well below the fermi level of the source electrode .",
    "then the state @xmath80 is almost dark because of the exponentially suppressed franck ",
    "condon matrix elements for the transition @xmath81 at the drain . in the conventional rate - equation formalism",
    "this would not reduce the transparency of the device as one could occupy the second level and tunnel off to the drain by converting the large charging energy into vibronic excitations . in the coherent setting , however , we are allowed to decouple one electronic state from one electrode , and although we have up to now only decoupled one state from the drain electrode , we could easily decouple one from the source electrode ; let this state be @xmath14 .",
    "the franck ",
    "condon blockade thus obstructs tunneling to the drain electrode , and the decoupling from the source electrode does not allow to doubly charge the device , hence reducing the conductance of the device drastically . as before , the lamb - shift contributions help to regularize this picture , by transferring the charge from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , allowing a second electron to occupy the device and converting the charging energy to vibronic energy in the tunneling to the drain electrode . in this particular",
    "setting , the roles of source and drain electrode have been reversed in the game of decoupling and transferring charge via virtual intermediate state of the reservoirs compared to the low - bias regime .      the electron ",
    "phonon coupling of a jahn  teller molecule is proportional to @xmath82 in the electronic hilbert space and thus breaks the rotational invariance of the molecular hamiltonian , which we have exploited to understand the steady - state dynamics .",
    "we have already shown that this results in the inability to decouple an electronic level completely from one of the electrodes , thus obstructing the use of generic tunnel couplings .",
    "looking closer at the quantitative properties of the master equation , the consequences can be seen in a number of effects .",
    "the different directions of the shift of the adiabatic potentials implied by the polaron transformation introduce a sign dependence on certain rates in the master equation .",
    "in particular the rates @xmath83 , will have different signs for @xmath84 being even or odd .",
    "when we encounter a situation , where the @xmath68-component of the pseudo - magnetic fields plays an important role in the dynamics , for example by transferring charge from a dark state into a conducting one , the structure of the jahn  teller molecule s electron ",
    "phonon coupling will cause a significant reduction of @xmath85 and thus of the current restoring force .",
    "the consequence is , in comparison with the anderson ",
    "holstein molecule , a profile of the coherent current blockade , which hardly shows an influence of the lamb shift at all , having a much higher contrast as is shown in figure  [ fig : bx_small ] .",

    "holstein : red , jahn  teller : blue , @xmath87[fig : bx_small ] ]    a second effect of the broken symmetry in the jahn ",
    "teller molecule is the ability to push the system into the parameter regime , where the anderson  holstein molecule would naturally split into two independent systems , that is , when the ratio @xmath88 is independent of the lead index @xmath3 as given by equation  [ eq : gr_cond ] .",
    "the main difference between the two models is that jahn  teller molecules the pseudo - magnetic fields are non - zero . in this regime ,",
    "the pseudo - bloch equations for the model in a voltage regime before the first vibronic sideband is @xmath89 because @xmath90 , this equation is _ uniquely _ solved with @xmath91 .",
    "a completely vanishing pseudo - spin is not only the statement that the coherences of the stationary density matrix are evaluated zero but that also the steady - state populations of both electronic levels are equal .",
    "such a result is unexpected insofar as it is independent of the ratio @xmath92 , which in a rate - equation treatment would determine the pseudo - spin s @xmath93-component .",
    "also , a vanishing pseudo - spin means that the reduced density matrix in the singly - charged sector is proportional to the unit matrix and invariant under rotations in the electronic hilbert space .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss several extensions of our basic model of a single - molecule junction with orbital degeneracies , which are related to experimental issues such as not having exact degeneracy or single - mode reservoirs .",
    "the requirement of strict degeneracy of the two orbitals is quite unphysical , when one takes into account all the physics of a single - molecule junction that we have neglected in the abstract model .",
    "however , the derivation of a master equation for the reduced density matrix requires strict degeneracy in order not to sacrifice the density matrix s coherences to the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "although there have been some attempts in the literature to derive a proper master equation for this case via the , not necessarily positive , bloch ",
    "redfield equation,@xcite we have shown in a previous work@xcite how such an equation can be derived rigorously by treating the breaking of degeneracy as a perturbation .",
    "assume the degeneracy of the electronic system hamiltonian @xmath94 , or using the pseudo - spin notation @xmath95 , is broken by @xmath96 , that is @xmath97 in second quantization .",
    "assuming this perturbation to be a slight breaking of the degeneracy that will not destroy the coherences in the reduced density matrix implies the relation @xmath98 . following the derivation given in ref .",

    "this term induces a second contribution to the hamiltonian part of the master equation besides the lamb shift ; the splitting essentially adds to the @xmath93-component of the pseudo - magnetic field , but in contrast to the lamb shift , @xmath101 is a free parameter of the theory .",
