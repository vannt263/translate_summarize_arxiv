    "the sed of blazars consists of two spectral bumps .",
    "the low - energy component is due to synchrotron radiation emanating from relativistic particles , and the high - energy component ( for leptonic jet model ) is a result of compton upscattering of the seed photon field by ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "the seed photons could either be the synchrotron photons produced in the jet ( synchrotron self compton , ssc ) @xcite , and/or external disk photons entering the jet directly ( external compton disk , ecd ) @xcite , and/or the disk photons getting reprocessed in the broad line region ( blr ) ( external compton cloud , ecc ) @xcite , and/or the dusty torus @xcite and then entering the jet .",

    "the mode of acceleration of plasma electrons ( and positrons ) to highly relativistic energies and its location in the jet is still not completely understood .",
    "one way to comprehend the physics of particle acceleration is the internal shock model , in which the central engine ( black hole + accretion disk ) spews out shells of plasma with different velocity , mass , and energy .",
    "the collision between such shells gives rise to internal shocks ( reverse ( rs ) and forward ( fs ) ) , which convert the ordered bulk kinetic energy of the plasma into the magnetic field energy and random kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "the highly accelerated particles then radiate and produce the emission observed from the jet .    the collision of two plasma shells results in an emission region as shown in figure [ emission_region ] .",

    "the model follows the evolution of the emission region out to sub - pc scales and simulates only the early phase of @xmath15-ray production . during this time",
    ", the radiative cooling is strongly dominant over adiabatic cooling and the emission region is highly optically thick out to ghz radio frequencies .",
    "thus , the simulated radio flux is well below that of the actual radio data . also , the phase of the emission region in which it gradually becomes transparent to radio frequencies is not simulated , as that would require the introduction of several additional , poorly constrained parameters .",
    "a cylindrical emission region is considered to calculate the resultant spectrum in a time - dependent manner .",
