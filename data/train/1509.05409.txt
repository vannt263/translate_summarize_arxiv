    "galaxy clusters are a rich source of information for examining fundamental astrophysical processes and cosmological parameters . as the most massive gravitationally - bound systems in the universe , they are excellent cosmological probes . cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift is sensitive to the underlying dark matter and dark energy content of the universe ,",
    "therefore , measurements of cluster masses can be employed to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "a cluster contains tens to thousands of galaxies residing in a dark matter halo with mass @xmath4 , and the galaxies or hot gas contained within a cluster can be observed across multiple wavelengths .",
    "capitalizing on clusters as cosmological probes requires not only a large , well - defined sample of cluster observations , but also a method to connect cluster measurements to host halo mass .",
    "a variety of techniques exist to determine galaxy cluster masses .",
    "a subset of these techniques , broadly labeled dynamical mass measurements , are based on measurements of galaxy kinematics .",
    "dynamical mass measurements utilize line of sight ( los ) velocities of the galaxies within the virial radius of the cluster , and may also take advantage of the unvirialized matter falling toward the cluster .",

    "the virial theorem approach considers cluster members los velocity dispersion , @xmath5 .",
    "this method scales halo mass , @xmath6 , with @xmath5 as a power law and famously led to @xcite s @xcite discovery of dark matter in the coma cluster .",

    "these large-@xmath109 objects shown in figure [ fig : pdfappendix ] are also well - predicted by sdm .",
    "while the @xmath65 gives a large range of errors , sdm can more accurately predict these cluster masses despite overly - large or small cylindrical cuts that contribute to significant impurity or incompleteness in the mock clusters .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath87 produce the smallest @xmath106 when the initial cylinders are large , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , for the medium aperture catalog and @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the large aperture catalog .",
    "the small aperture catalog error distribution is wider : @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "however , in all cases except @xmath87 applied to the small aperture cylinder , the width of error distribution is narrower than the pure catalog power law , which has @xmath116 . sdm performs better with impurity over incompleteness , with larger cylinders producing slightly more accurate mass predictions .",
    "errors produced by a power law scaling relation are clearly dependent on the choices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , sometimes catastrophically overpredicting cluster masses .",
    "though a standard power law scaling fits and error distributions are sensitive to choices in cuts , sdm can predict accurately under a wide range of scenarios , provided the training and test data have the same imposed cuts ."
