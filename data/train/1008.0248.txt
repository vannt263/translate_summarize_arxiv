    "in this article , we continue the study begun in @xcite ( paper i ) of asymptotically - flat solutions of einstein s equations that are periodic in time . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that such space - times , if either vacuum or electrovacuum and analytic at @xmath0 , are necessarily stationary near @xmath0 . here",
    "we extend this result to space - times whose source is one of a range of scalar field models .    in @xcite , we also considered the problem of inheritance of symmetry .",
    "this is the question of whether , if a space - time which is a solution of einstein s equations with some matter source has a symmetry , the matter source necessarily has the same symmetry . for asymptotically - flat electrovacuum space - times which are analytic near @xmath0 we showed that the symmetry is necessarily inherited . for scalar field sources",
    ", we now obtain the same result in some cases but not in others .",
    "the scalar fields we consider fall into two broad classes .",
    "the first class includes the complex , massless klein - gordon ( kg ) field which satisfies the wave equation ( [ kgeqphys ] ) and has energy - momentum tensor as in ( [ kg - tab ] ) .",
    "here we prove    theorem [ one ] : _ a weakly - asymptotically - simple time - periodic solution of the einstein - massless - kg field equations which is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 necessarily has a killing vector which is time - like in the interior and extends to a translation on @xmath1 .",
    "_    it is also possible to include a potential for the scalar field , as in subsection ( [ sspot ] ) , and therefore to include a mass - term , and the above result will continue to hold subject to a weak condition on the potential .",
    "now one knows , for example from @xcite , that there exist boson - star solutions of the einstein - massive - kg system for which the metric is static , spherically - symmetric and asymptotically - flat , while the complex scalar field takes the form @xmath2 : these solutions are genuinely periodic in time but not stationary , and the source does not inherit all the symmetries of the metric .",
    "however , it is easy to see that these solutions are not analytic near @xmath0 , which is why they do not violate our result .    the other class of scalar fields contains what we shall call _ the conformal scalar field _ , that is , it satisfies the conformally - invariant wave equation ( [ confinvwaveeq ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall take the field to be real , though the formalism allows a complex field . in the real case",
    ", there is a conserved energy - momentum tensor for such a source due originally to @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , given in ( [ confcoupledtab ] ) .",
    "this leads to a form of the einstein equations ( [ einsteqs2 ] ) studied in @xcite , where it was shown that there is a well - posed initial value problem . with suitable data on hyperboloidal surfaces extending to @xmath0",
    ", there exist asymptotically - flat solutions even with a regular point at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "explicit static spherically - symmetric solutions were earlier given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "starting from the assumption of an asymptotically - flat solution of these einstein equations , we may proceed as before , with the corresponding result :    theorem [ two ] : _ a weakly - asymptotically - simple time - periodic solution of the einstein - conformal - scalar field equations which is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 necessarily has a killing vector which is time - like in the interior and extends to a translation on @xmath1 . _    turning to the question of inheritance , for the first class of fields we show ( theorem [ three ] ) that the only way a stationary symmetry can fail to be inherited in the class of space - times under consideration is if the ( necessarily complex ) scalar field has the form @xmath4 in terms of comoving space - coordinates @xmath5 and time @xmath6 .",
    "this is periodic and the previous result can be applied to deduce that the symmetry is in fact inherited . for a complex conformal scalar field , the same argument can be used to show that there are no non  inheriting fields of this form but this is only a partial result as we can not characterise the non - inheriting fields in the same way .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : in section 2 we review the einstein - massless - kg equations and show how to formulate the _ conformal einstein - massless - kg equations _ , by which we mean the equations formulated for an unphysical , rescaled metric which correspond to the physical einstein - massless - kg equations .",
    "this enables the equations to be extended to @xmath0 . in section 3 , we do the same thing for the einstein - conformal - scalar equations , using the conserved enery - momentum tensor proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this energy - momentum tensor does not satisfy the dominant energy condition , but we give some arguments why it might none - the - less lead to positive total energy . in section 4 ,",
    "we give expressions for the bondi mass and bondi mass - loss for both classes of scalar field sources .",
    "the bondi mass - loss for the conformal scalar field is not manifestly positive ( at @xmath7 ) but in the periodic case the average over a period is . in section 5 , we recall the coordinate and null - tetrad system used in @xcite and prove theorems [ one ] and [ two ] , to show that , in this setting , periodic solutions are actually stationary . the proof is much as in @xcite : one shows inductively that all radial derivatives of all metric components at @xmath1 are @xmath8-independent so that @xmath9 is a killing vector .",
    "in section 6 , we discuss inheritance and prove theorem [ three ] to show that stationarity is necessarily inherited in an analytic , weakly - asymptotically - flat , einstein - massless - kg solution .    in order to be able to follow clearly the arguments in the main text , in appendix a we review all newman - penrose equations for a general source : that is , the commutation relations of the np operators , and the ricci and bianchi identities . in appendix b the conformally rescaled scalar wave equations and conformal bianchi identities for the massless scalar field are written down in unphysical space in manifestly regular form .",
    "the regular conformal bianchi identities for conformally invariant scalar fields follow in fact from the conformal bianchi identities for any matter field for which the ricci spinor behaves as @xmath10 at @xmath0 .",
    "the projections of the bianchi identities are given in section b4 of appendix b. the asymptotic form of the solutions of the einstein - massless - scalar field equations at future null infinity @xmath7 is discussed in appendix c ; this is used in section 4 in the derivation of the bondi mass and the mass - loss formula for both massless - klein - gordon field and conformal - scalar field .",
    "finally , in appendix d we give some examples of exact solutions of the einstein - conformal - scalar equations and discuss the possible presence of singularities .",
    "first we investigate the complex scalar field which satisfies the massless klein - gordon equation in the physical spacetime ,    @xmath11    we shall consistently use the tilde to indicate quantities in the physical space - time , untilded quantities referring to the rescaled , unphysical space - time .",

    "since the wave equation ( [ kgeqphys ] ) is not conformally invariant , there is a priori no preferred choice .",
    "however , since near @xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) the radiative part of the field behaves as    @xmath14    and we wish to have a non - vanishing regular unphysical field on @xmath1 , we define    @xmath15    in the following , we employ the notation    @xmath16    and using the np formalism used in the following are introduced in section 3 and appendix a of paper i and repeated in section 5 below . ] we denote the components of the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 by special symbols :    @xmath19    and correspondingly with tildes in the physical spacetime .    in this notation ,",

    "this system , by analogy with friedrich s ` conformal einstein equations ' @xcite we shall call the ` conformal einstein - massless - kg equations ' .",
    "in @xcite we derived the physical bianchi identities expressed in terms of the unphysical quantities as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is given by ( [ defsa ] ) , @xmath25 is the ricci spinor and @xmath26 is the rescaled weyl spinor ( see eq .

    "we find    @xmath28    the right hand side of this equation is not manifestly regular on @xmath0 , while the left hand side is regular by assumption of asymptotic flatness .",
    "next we express the physical ricci spinor via the unphysical quantities ,    @xmath29    and insert this expression into ( [ confbi2 ] ) .    in order to simplify the resulting equations ,",

    "if an asymptotically flat electro - vacuum spacetime is stationary , the electromagnetic field has to inherit stationarity .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of the massless - kg field , for now it is not obvious what kind of time - dependence of the scalar field @xmath94 is compatible with the stationarity of the spacetime .",
    "we first find this time - dependence and then the result follows , using the bondi mass - loss formula and induction .",
    "[ three ] in a stationary , analytic , weakly - asymptotically - simple solution of the einstein - massless - kg equations with stationarity killing vector @xmath9 , the physical massless - kg field must take the form @xmath276 , where @xmath277 .",
    "if the metric is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 in the coordinates introduced above then @xmath94 is in fact time - independent .",
    "for the first part , we use the coordinate system introduced above and assume the stationarity of the spacetime .",
    "hence , @xmath251 is a killing vector of the metric and the lie derivative @xmath278 reduces to simple partial derivative with respect to @xmath8 , which will be also denoted by a dot .",
    "since @xmath75 is stationary , einstein s equations ( [ einsteqs1 ] ) imply    @xmath279    the lie derivative of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ kg - tab ] ) is then    @xmath280    where @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "let us decompose the fields @xmath94 and @xmath283 into real and imaginary parts ,    @xmath284    with @xmath285 and @xmath286 being real functions .",

    "since @xmath289 and @xmath290 are assumed to be linearly independent , all terms in the last equation must vanish separately .",
