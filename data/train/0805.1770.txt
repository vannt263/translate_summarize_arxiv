    "anyons  which interpolate between bosons and fermions  may exist in two dimensions ( 2d ) , obeying fractional statistics .",
    "fractional statistics have recently been observed in experiments on the quasiparticle excitations of a 2d electron gas in the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) regime @xcite .",
    "the anyonic quasiparticles have profound implications for topological quantum states of matter @xcite .",
    "for example , non - abelian topological order can be studied through manipulating fqh states in a 2d electron gas . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of anyons has become important in topological quantum computation @xcite . in one dimension ( 1d ) anyons acquire a step - function - like phase when two identical particles exchange their positions .",
    "different aspects of anyons in 1d have been considered @xcite . among these",
    "an anyonic extension @xcite of the 1d integrable bose gas with @xmath0-function interaction @xcite has attracted recent attention , including the basic construction of the anyon model @xcite .",
    "many new results have been obtained for this model , including the connection with haldane @xcite exclusion statistics @xcite , correlation functions @xcite , entanglement @xcite and expanding anyonic fluids @xcite .",
    "a key feature of 1d anyons is that they retain fractional statistics in quasi - momentum space and the anyonic signature of the exchange interaction  the topological anyonic interaction and dynamical interaction are inextricably related .",
    "1d anyons show an intriguing sensitivity of the boundary condition of their wave function on the specific position of the particles @xcite",
    ". therefore the study of exactly solvable interacting anyons in 1d should give insight into understanding topological effects in many - body physics .",
    "in this communication we propose a 1d model of anyons with @xmath0-function and derivative @xmath0-function interaction and solve the model by means of the co - ordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "the model contains an additional independent interaction parameter so that in principle one can study anyonic signatures through tuning the interactions . for this more general model",
    "we show that the anyonic signature is inextricably related to the velocities of the colliding particles and the pairwise dynamical interaction between identical particles .",
    "we consider creation and annihilation operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 at point @xmath4 , which satisfy the anyonic commutation relations @xmath5 the multi - step function @xmath6 appearing in the phase factors satisfies @xmath7 for @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . in terms of these operators the hamiltonian describing @xmath1 anyons of atomic mass @xmath10 confined in a length @xmath11",
    "is @xmath12 \\label{ham - new}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we also impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the tunable parameters in the model are ( i ) @xmath13 , the dynamical interaction strength which drives the particles in elastic scattering through zero range contact interaction , where @xmath14 is the coupling constant , ( ii ) the nonlinear dispersion coupling constant @xmath15 , which describes a delta shift in collisions , and ( iii ) the statistical parameter @xmath16 which varies the statistics of the particles from pure bose statistics ( @xmath17 ) to pure fermi statistics ( @xmath18 ) . the model differs from the interacting 1d bose gas @xcite and 1d interacting anyons @xcite due to the presence of the nonlinear dispersion @xmath15 , i.e. , the s - wave scattering is disturbed by a delta shift in collisions .",
    "effectively , the 1d scattering length is increased or decreased in individual pairwise collisions by this dispersion .",
    "it follows that the model contains well known models as special cases in certain limits . for @xmath17 , hamiltonian ( [ ham - new ] ) reduces to that of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger model @xcite , which has been studied by means of scattering bethe ansatz in the context of soliton physics . for @xmath19",
    ", it describes the model of 1d interacting anyons . for @xmath20",
    ", it reduces to the model of 1d interacting bosons , while for @xmath21 it reduces to quantum derivative nonlinear schrodinger model @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the general model ( [ ham - new ] ) exhibits more exotic dynamics than the two models corresponding to the special cases @xmath17 and @xmath19 .    for convenience",
    ", we hereafter set @xmath22 .",
    "we also use a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath23 to characterize different physical regimes of the anyon gas , where @xmath24 is the linear density .",
    "we first present the corresponding equation of motion @xmath25 $ ] via the time - dependent quantum fields , i.e. , the nonlinear schrdinger equation is given by @xmath26 we note that this is an anyonic version of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation . restricting to its @xmath1-particle sector we can reduce the eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian ( [ ham - new ] ) to a quantum many - body problem . to this end , we define a fock vacuum state @xmath27 . thus we can prove that the number operator @xmath1 and momentum operator @xmath28 are conserved , where @xmath29    in order to properly assign the anyonic phase @xmath30 @xcite in the domain @xmath31 , we write the @xmath1-particle eigenstate as @xmath32 where the wavefunction amplitude is of the form @xmath33 here the sum extends over all @xmath34 permutations @xmath28",
    ". the choice of the sign of the anyonic phase factor in equation can be arbitrary and may lead to different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "here we prefer to a fix a boundary condition where we count the anyonic phase factor in equation through the order of the particles in the scattering states @xcite . by acting on the eigenstate with hamiltonian the eigenvalue problem for hamiltonian",
    ", namely @xmath35 can be reduced to solving the quantum mechanical problem @xmath36 where @xmath37    this anyon model turns out to be bethe ansatz solvable with independent values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "changing the coordinates to centre of mass coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 leads to the eigenvalue equation ( [ q - e ] ) in the form @xmath40 integrating both sides of this equation with respect to @xmath41 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and taking the limit @xmath44 gives the discontinuity condition @xmath45 \\chi(x_1,\\ldots , x_i , x_{j},\\ldots , x_n)|_{x_i = x_j } \\label{jump}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the derivative of the wavefunction .",
    "this equation gives a relation between the coefficients @xmath46 of the form @xmath47 which is the two - body scattering relation .",
    "this relation gives rise to a functional scalar scattering matrix which factorizes three - body scattering processes into the product of three two - body scattering matrices @xcite . in this sense",
    "the yang - baxter equation is trivially satisfied , guaranteeing no diffraction in the scattering process @xcite .",
    "consequently the @xmath1-particle scattering amplitude can be factorized into the products of two - particle amplitudes .",
    "another way to establish the integrability of the model is to explicitly construct an infinite number of higher order conserved quantities , as shown for the 1d bose gas in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the effective interaction strengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 appearing in the solution are given by @xmath50 in this model these effective coupling constants implement the transmutation between statistical and dynamical interactions .",
    "to complete the solution in terms of the bethe ansatz we impose the periodic boundary condition @xmath51 on the anyonic wavefunction in the fundamental region @xmath52 . as in the solution of the interacting anyon model ( @xmath53 )",
    ", this leads to the appearance of various phase factors @xcite .",
    "the wave functions for other regions can be determined through application of the anyonic symmetry .",
    "the periodic boundary condition can also be imposed on other wavefunction arguments @xmath54 , in each case leading to the same anyonic phase factor in the bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) @xcite . for this model ,",
    "the energy is given by @xmath55 where the quasi - momenta @xmath56 satisfy the bae @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the total momentum is @xmath59 in minimizing the energy we consider @xmath60 ( mod @xmath61 ) in the phase factor .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution provides in principle the full physics of the model . for the case",
    "@xmath17 , the bae are consistent with the scattering states constructed for the generalized nonlinear schrdinger model @xcite .",
    "it is also clear to see from the bae that the phase shift @xmath62\\ ] ] depends essentially on the anyon parameter @xmath16 , the dynamical interaction strength @xmath14 and the nonlinear dispersion of velocity @xmath15 through the effective interactions . among the competing interactions ,",
    "the nonlinearity parameter @xmath15 is essential in determining the bound states . the @xmath0-function interaction strength @xmath14 plays the role of a driving force in collisions .",
    "however , the anyonic parameter @xmath16 determines the statistical signature of the particles .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the bae ( [ ba - new ] ) reveals that bound states exist for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in general",
    ", the form of the bound states appears to be extremely complicated .",
    "for example , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we have the bound state @xmath67 . in this communication",
    "we focus on the repulsive regime , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for which the bethe roots are real .    in the weak coupling limit @xmath70 , the leading term for the ground state energy , obtained from the bae ( [ ba - new ] ) , is @xmath71 to this order , for @xmath17",
    "the ground state energy is independent of the nonlinear dispersion @xmath15 and reduces to that of weakly interacting bosons .",
    "however , the quasimomentum distribution @xmath72 deviates from the usual semicircle law @xcite at @xmath19 ( see ) . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the high density distribution drifts to the right hand side and the front becomes steeper as the nonlinear dispersion @xmath15 increases . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the high density part drifts to the left hand side .",
    "the nature of this kind of quantum drift in quasimomentum space is due to the delta shift or equivalently the nonlinear dispersion of velocity , which effectively increases or decreases the 1d scattering length in individual pairwise collisions .    when the total momentum is non zero , i.e. @xmath75 , the left and right drifts are no longer symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath15 . here",
    "the anyonic parameter @xmath16 also introduces quantum drifts in quasimomentum space .",
    "a particular example is illustrated in .",
    "for @xmath76 , the front of the distribution become very steep and the width becomes narrower as @xmath15 increases .",
    "the energy decreases as @xmath15 increases .",
    "however , for @xmath74 , the distribution becomes flatter . in this case , the energy increases as @xmath77 increases .    in the strong coupling limit @xmath78 , one can perform the strong coupling expansion with the bae ( [ ba - new ] ) . in this limit",
    "the ground state of the model becomes that of the tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "this is mainly because in the strong repulsive limit , the particles behave like fermions in thermalized states . as a result",
    "the effect induced by the nonlinear dispersion of velocity is suppressed . to obtain the explicit result for the ground state energy , let all quasimomenta @xmath56 shift to @xmath79 and for simplicity , choose @xmath1 to be odd . in this limit , the quasimomenta are given explicitly by @xmath80     \\left(1+\\frac{2n}{(lc'-\\epsilon '   \\nu ) }   \\right)^{-1 } \\label{tg - n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy is given by @xmath83    it can be seen from the bethe roots ( [ tg - n ] ) that the flat fermion - like distribution becomes inclined as @xmath77 becomes large .",
    "the distribution almost linearly increases or decreases depending on the direction of the current and the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath15 .",
    "the system is strongly collective in the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "we have presented an exactly solved model of 1d anyons with general @xmath0-function and derivative @xmath0-function interaction . the bethe ansatz solution has been obtained by means of the coordinate bethe ansatz .",
    "we have seen that the anyonic signature is inextricably related to the nonlinear dispersion of velocity and the pairwise dynamical interaction between identical particles .",
    "competing interactions among the anyonic parameter @xmath16 and the strengths of the @xmath0-function interaction @xmath14 and the nonlinear dispersion of velocity @xmath15 result in more subtle bound states and scattering states .",
    "preliminary analysis of the bethe ansatz solution in the weak and strong coupling limits has revealed drifts in the quasimomentum distribution as a function of the nonlinear dispersion and the anyonic parameter .",
    "the quasimomentum distribution may provide a plausible way to observe anyonic behaviour in a general model with @xmath0-function and derivative @xmath0-function interaction . in particular",
    ", it suggests the possibility of observing anyonic behaviour via the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation , perhaps with regard to the propagation of solitons in nonlinear media . on the other hand , the observed quantum drifts in distribution",
    "may perhaps also be seen in experiments with trapped ultracold atoms in and out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution should also provide an accessible way to explore the dynamics in time evolution of the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ nse ] ) , just as the time - dependent dynamics of the 1d boson model has recently been investigated @xcite .",
    "in addition , the investigation of fractional exclusion statistics @xcite in this generalized 1d anyon gas would provide insight into the influence on the statistical signature of both dynamical interaction and nonlinear dispersion .",
