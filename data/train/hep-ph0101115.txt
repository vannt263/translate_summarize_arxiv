    "with the operation of rhic@xcite , heavy ion collisions have entered a new era , where semihard collisions become more important compared to soft collisions .",
    "therefore a detailed knowledge of intrinsic parton distributions is important for a quantitative understanding of heavy quark production and/or cross sections at large transverse momenta . due to the increase of the gluon distribution at small @xmath0 ,",
    "a sizeable cross section at mid rapidity comes from the region where the transverse momenta of partons become comparable to their longitudinal momenta .",
    "therefore a @xmath2 factorization scheme is preferred , where the intrinsic transverse momenta of partons are included in the calculation of the minijet cross sections . especially in nuclei ,",
    "intrinsic transverse momenta of gluons can become quite large , since at small @xmath0 the gluon clouds of the individual nucleons overlap and interact accumulating large transverse momenta . a careful inversion of the color dipole nuclear cross section allows to assess this effect .",
    "we differentiate between the gluon saturation scale @xmath6 due to the interaction of gluons with one another inside the same nucleus _ before _ the collision and the saturation scale @xmath3 of produced gluons _",
    "after _ the first collision between the nuclei .",
    "both scales arise due to different mechanisms , but sometimes appear to be of the same magnitude .    inside",
    "the nucleus supersaturation occurs due to the color neutrality of the nucleons .",
    "one can not have gluons at small x and small @xmath2 , because the nucleons from which they originate are color neutral .",
    "this finding is derived from a careful inversion of the multiple scattering of a test color dipole on the nucleus .",
    "it is confirmed by the evaluation of the bfkl equation in the nucleus@xcite .",
    "we will give our derivation of the unintegrated gluon distribution in nuclei in section ii .",
    "in section iii we will use this distribution to calculate the mini jet cross section @xmath7 . due to the intrinsic transverse momenta of the gluons the lo qcd cross section",
    "is enhanced at a given cut off scale . since the intrinsic transverse momenta depend on the number of gluon clouds overlapping , we find that for more central collisions the enhancement is larger .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of the gluon system which is produced after the first collision .",
    "these now on shell gluons are numerous at small nuclear impact parameters and crowd the impact parameter dependent area @xmath8 of intersection between the two nuclei .",
    "concentrating on gluons in the central rapidity region one sees that their number @xmath9 times their individual size @xmath10 can not exceed the area @xmath8 .",
    "this equation comes from an estimate of the number of merging gluons @xmath11 of produced gluons compared to the number of splitting gluons @xmath12 @xcite . since the number of gluons decreases severely as @xmath13 and the saturation criterion @xmath14 increases with @xmath15 one obtains a self consistent determination of the saturation scale of produced partons @xmath3@xcite .",
    "intrinsic transverse momentum will increase the number of produced gluons at the same cut off . as a final result , these effects lead to a higher saturation scale @xmath16gev than the scale found without intrinsic @xmath2 . in the framework of local parton hadron duality",
    "the so derived gluon distribution can be directly applied to estimate the number of produced charged hadrons . from @xmath17 collisions @xcite the conversion factor",

    "as first pointed in @xcite , the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity can be used to test different saturation models . and",
    "very recently , there have been several studies on this quantity by using different saturation approaches@xcite .",

    "the transverse momentum distribution peaks at @xmath57 and then decreases towards small @xmath2 , vanishing at zero transverse momentum .",
    "we call this dynamical phenomena `` supersaturation '' . a similar behavior for the unintegrated gluon distribution function of nucleus",
    "was also derived by the evaluation of the bfkl equation in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "supersaturation is quite different from saturation where growth of the gluon density slows down at small transverse momenta cf .",
    "the dynamical origin of supersaturation at small @xmath2 is the dipole - nucleus cross section for large dipoles , which is reduced due to multiple scattering .",
    "having the unintegrated gluon density of the nuclei , we calculate the production of gluons and quarks after one collision . to include the intrinsic @xmath2 effects",

    "the averaging function @xmath63 reflects the intrinsic @xmath2 effects from the incident partons , which depend on the impact parameter @xmath40 of the two nuclei , and can be obtained from the unintegrated gluon distribution functions calculated in the previous section . since the intrinsic gluon distribution functions of the two nuclei depend separately on the locations @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the event relative to each nuclear center , we first derive the differential averaging function depending on @xmath64 and @xmath65 , from eq .",

    ", we plot this quantity as a function of @xmath2 for different impact parameters @xmath40 .",
    "this figure shows that for more central collisions ( smaller @xmath40 ) , there is a stronger effect from intrinsic gluon transverse momenta @xmath2 .    from the above formulas , we derive the number of gluons produced in the first collision of nuclei @xmath72 at impact parameter @xmath40 , applying an infrared cut off @xmath73 on the produced gluons .",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 we find that if we neglect the intrinsic @xmath2 effects ( setting @xmath76 in the above equation ) , we return back to the results in qcd - improved parton model based on the collinear factorization approach@xcite . however , for high energy nuclear collisions , we can not neglect these intrinsic @xmath2 effects , which enhance the cross section significantly at a given infrared cut off @xmath73 .",
    "for central collision ( @xmath54 ) of identical nuclei a@xmath77a with radius @xmath78 , the interaction area of the two nuclei is identical to their transverse size @xmath79 . assuming the radius of each produced gluon with transverse momentum @xmath73 to be @xmath80 , we have saturation for an infrared cut off @xmath81 when the produced quanta fill the transverse interaction area @xmath79 . all gluons with momenta smaller than the saturation momenta fuse into gluons with a total momentum larger than the saturation momentum .",

    "the saturation scale for the produced gluons @xmath3 is a property of the interacting system of the two nuclei and depends on the nucleus nucleus impact parameter @xmath40 .",
    "our results show only a weak dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath40 which is not so dramatic as found in ref . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the saturation scale @xmath3 in our model is larger than @xmath106 for a wide range of @xmath40 .",

    "in this paper , we have calculated the minijet production in @xmath118 collisions at rhic , including the enhancement from intrinsic transverse momenta of the incident gluons .",
    "we derived the unintegrated gluon distributions of cold nuclei and found `` super saturation '' ; the number density of gluons vanishes at zero transverse momentum and has a maximum at the intrinsic saturation scale @xmath6 .",
    "we differentiate between this gluon saturation scale @xmath6 inside both nuclei _ before _ the collision and the saturation scale @xmath3 of produced gluons _",
    "after _ the first collision between the nuclei . to obtain the saturation scale @xmath3",
    ", we apply the saturation criterion in the central rapidity region , where the produced parton number @xmath9 times their individual size @xmath10 must not exceed the area @xmath8 of the two interacting nucleus .",
    "intrinsic transverse momentum of the incident partons increases the number of produced gluons ( i.e. , the production cross section ) at the same cut off , and then leads to a higher saturation scale @xmath16gev than the scale found without intrinsic @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we find that our numerical results on the centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity agree well with the experimental phenix and phobos data , which support the saturation scheme we used in this paper .",
    "we note as a final remark , that it is also very important to directly determine the intrinsic transverse momentum scale @xmath6 for large nuclei . for this purpose",
    "we propose to measure `` monojet '' production at rhic , in which the final state only contains one large @xmath119 jet without any other large @xmath119 balancing jets . by triggering on",
    "produced particles in the projectile and target fragmentation regions with a summed high transverse momentum in one azimuthal hemisphere , one may select minijets with transverse momentum in the opposite azimuthal hemisphere which come from @xmath11 processes in the central region . in principle",
    "one can thereby test the intrinsic saturation scale @xmath6 which is characteristic for isolated nuclei and also accessible in electron nucleus scattering .",
    "the same configuration of monojet production was also suggested in@xcite to search the jet quenching effects in high energy parton production .",
