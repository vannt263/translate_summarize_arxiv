    "nanoclusters are technologically important for the construction of nanodevices .",
    "because the size of nanoclusters is mesoscopic , thermodynamic properties of such materials are still not well understood@xcite , though the methods to make nanoclusters such as adiabatic expansion through a nozzle and a laser ablation technique are well established.@xcite    dynamics of nanoclusters are extensively investigated from both scientific and technological interest .",
    "there are many numerical studies on cluster - cluster and cluster - surface collisions based on the molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "@xcite we observe variety of rebound processes for such systems caused by the competition between the attractive interaction and the repulsive interaction of two colliding bodies .",
    "binary collisions of identical clusters cause coalescence , scattering , and fragmentation depending on the cluster size and the impact energy .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , cluster - surface collisions induce soft landing , embedding , and fragmentation.@xcite the attractive interaction plays crucially important roles in collisions of nanoclusters , so that the modeling of the cohesive collisions in various scale are actively discussed in these days.@xcite .",
    "however , the attractive interaction can be reduced by some combinations of the two interacting objects and the relative configuration of colliding molecules.@xcite awasthi _ et al . _",
    "introduced a modified lennard - jones model to simulate the rebound process of a @xmath0 cluster onto a @xmath1 surface@xcite , in which they introduced a cohesive parameter to reduce the attractive interaction between different atoms on the surface .",
    "there exists a corresponding experiment on the rebound process of bi nanoclusters on a si surface with the aid of a v - shaped template etched on a silicon wafer.@xcite this suggests that the modified lennard - jones clusters can approximately describe collisions of real clusters .",
    "similarly , recent papers have reported that surface - passivated si nanoclusters exhibit elastic rebounds on si surface due to the reduction of the attractive interaction between the surfaces.@xcite in particular , saitoh _",
    "_ confirmed that the behavior in collisions of modified lennard - jones clusters is similar to that of h - passivated si clusters from their simulation.@xcite these results also support that the modified lennard - jones model can be regarded as a simplified model of nanoclusters .",
    "in general , thermal fluctuation also plays an important role for small systems such as nanoclusters .",
    "indeed , the present authors carried out the molecular dynamics simulation of colliding thermally activated modified lennard - jones clusters to investigate the impact phenomena and found the existence of the  super - rebound \" in which the restitution coefficient is larger than unity.@xcite recently , it has been reported that such a rebound can be observed in a molecular dynamics simulation of a collision of cu nanoparticles on a rigid wall.@xcite in addition , another research group has reported that large recovery strain after loading ( called super - elasticity ) can be found in a small system.@xcite although there is a possibility that such an anomalous mechanical property of small systems is also concerned with the emergence of  super rebounds \" , the underlying mechanism for the  super rebounds \" is still unclear .",
    "in macroscopic systems , the restitution coefficient larger than unity can be observed in oblique collisions between a hard sphere and a soft elastic plate @xcite , which differs from the super rebound .",
    "indeed , the restitution coefficient can easily become larger than unity if the rebound direction is changed in oblique collisions .",
    "as another example , a recent study reported that the large - scale magnetized plasmoids can gain the increased kinetic energy after collision in the heliosphere.@xcite on the contrary , in microscopic systems such as nanoclusters , the true  super rebounds \" can be observed in normal collisions , which implies that a part of thermal energy is converted to macroscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this may imply a possibility to make a nanoscale object which extracts work from its internal energy .",
    "although the averaged behavior of the restitution coefficient against the relative impact speed can be approximately understood by the macroscopic theory of cohesive collisions,@xcite the mechanism of curious energy transfer against intuition of the thermodynamics is important to both fundamental physics and energy technology .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the mechanism of the super rebounds from the viewpoint of the energy transfer between the microscopic and the macroscopic degrees of freedom . for this purpose",
    ", we investigate the characteristics of thermodynamic functions such as temperature and entropy in the super rebounds based on the molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the change in structures of the colliding nanoclusters characterizing super rebounds by the introduction of steinhart s order parameter@xcite and some related geometrical order parameters .",

    "let us introduce our model .",
    "our model consists of two identical nanoclusters , each of which contains @xmath2 `` atoms '' ( fig .",
    "[ nc001 ] ) .",
    "the clusters have facets due to the small number of `` atoms '' .",
    "to construct one cluster , we first make the face - centered cubic crystal of @xmath3 layers of atoms .    .",
    "each of them contains 236 `` atoms '' which are bound together by the modified lennard - jones potential . ]",
    "next , we cut out a spherical cluster from the cube . in fig.[nc001 ] , we call the upper projectile and the lower target clusters c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 , respectively . all the atoms in one cluster",
    "are bound together by the modified lennard - jones potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance between two arbitrary atoms @xmath8 and @xmath9 in this system , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the core diameter and the scale of energy , respectively . here , @xmath12 is the cohesive parameter which changes the magnitude of cohesion between atoms . in our simulation",
    ", we adopt @xmath13 between the atom @xmath8 on the lower surface of c@xmath4 and the atom @xmath9 on the upper surface of c@xmath5 while @xmath14 between all the atoms in each cluster . here the definition of the surface and the bulk atoms is as follows .",
    "each cluster consists of @xmath15 layers of atoms .",
    "we define the atoms outside the concentric inscribed sphere as the surface atoms while the other atoms as the bulk atoms .",
    "we assume that the surface atoms are different from the bulk atoms , which may cause the weak cohesive interaction between the clusters.@xcite    let us introduce the volume fraction @xmath16 which is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number density .",
    "figure [ pot ] is the relationship between @xmath16 and the initial potential energy of one cluster . to construct a cluster ,",
    "we adopt the value for @xmath16 as @xmath19 in which the potential energy is minimum , while we adopted @xmath20 in our previous work .",
    "@xcite    the procedure of our simulation is as follows . as the initial condition of the simulation ,",
    "the centers of mass of c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 are placed along the @xmath21axis with the separation @xmath22 between the centers of mass of c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 , where @xmath23 is the radius of the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ nc001 ] ) .",
    "the two clusters are placed in mirror symmetric positions with respect to @xmath24 so that a facet of one cluster is placed face - to - face with that of another cluster .",
    "we have checked that the relative rotational orientation of the clusters around @xmath25-axis little affect the relationship between the restitution coefficient and the colliding speed in our previous work .",
    "@xcite the initial velocities of the atoms in both c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 satisfies the maxwell - boltzmann distribution with the initial temperature @xmath26 .",

    "we numerically solve the equation of motion of each atom @xmath8 described by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mass of an atom and the position of the @xmath8-th atom , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the modified lennard - jones force which is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ lj ] ) as @xmath31.\\ ] ] numerical integration of the equation of motion for each atom is carried out by the second order symplectic integrator with the time step @xmath32 . to reduce computational costs",
    ", we introduce the cut - off length @xmath33 of the lennard - jones interaction as @xmath34 . the rate of energy conservation , @xmath35 ,",
    "is kept within @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the initial energy of the system and @xmath38 is the energy at time @xmath39 .",
    "we equilibrate the clusters by using the velocity scaling method @xcite as the thermostat in the initial @xmath40 simulation steps . here",
    ", we introduce the kinetic temperature , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number of atom and the velocity of the center of mass of one cluster , respectively .",
    "it has been confirmed that the temperature of the system converges on a desired temperature during the equilibration .    after the equilibration we give the translational velocity to c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 to make them collide against each other without the thermostat .",
    "we give the translational speed with the acceleration @xmath44 .",
    "the typical value of the relative impact speed in our simulation is @xmath45 , which is slightly less than the thermal velocity of the system defined by @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "here we show the macroscopic properties of the colliding nanoclusters in our simulation . to characterize the rebound behavior of macroscopic inelastic collisions , we calculate the restitution coefficient @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath25 component of the relative translational speed of c@xmath4 to c@xmath5 , and @xmath51 is the scaled time of separation of the clusters , @xmath52 .",
    "we define the time of separation @xmath53 by the time when the relative rebound speed becomes stable after the collision .",
    "figure [ v0_2 ] shows the histograms of @xmath48 for initial temperatures @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "each histogram is constructed from 1000 samples with the initial speed of @xmath57 .",
    "we find @xmath58 samples of the super rebound at @xmath59 while all samples are the ordinary rebounds at @xmath60 . at @xmath47",
    "we found that only 1 sample is the super rebound . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt @xmath61 , most of the rebounds are ordinary .",
    "we can find only two samples of super rebounds even at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the super rebounds can be observed only if the colliding speed is lower or almost equal to the thermal speed .",
    "here we show the time evolution of kinetic temperature defined by eq.([temp ] ) .",
    "figure [ temp_modelb ] shows typical examples of the changes in temperature in an ordinary rebound and a super rebound .",

    "a slight discrepancy in temperature between c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 is observed after the equilibration in fig .",
    "[ temp_modelb ] ( a ) .",

    "( [ entropy ] ) in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "figure [ ent_modelb](a ) plots the time evolution of @xmath65 for c@xmath4 and c@xmath5 in a super rebound , which shows that the entropy increases in c@xmath5 while it decreases in c@xmath4 during collision for @xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "figure [ ent_modelb](b ) shows that the discrepancy of entropy change remains finite after the collision for @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable that the entropy of c@xmath5 decreases corresponding to the decrease of temperature .",
    "so far , we have reported the results of our simulation on thermodynamic quantities .",
    "what we confirm is that the behavior of such quantities in super rebounds is seemingly in contrast to what is expected from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , we should note that the second law is only strictly valid after ensemble average is taken over . in this sense",
    ", our result does not violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "let us investigate the structural change of the clusters induced by collisions . to characterize the structural change , we first introduce a local bond order parameter known as time - averaged steinhart s bond order parameter @xmath72",
    "( see eq.([qli ] ) for its explicit definition ) .",
    "@xcite we note that steinhardt s bond order parameters are used to characterize the structural change in nanoclusters associated with collisions@xcite and melting@xcite as well as equilibrium structures of crystalline solids . according to the definition of the bond order parameter summarized in appendix [ appb ] , we calculate @xmath73 and @xmath74 of each atom @xmath8 before and after collisions , respectively . for the time average in calculation of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we use @xmath75 and @xmath76 for before and after collisions , respectively , with the time interval @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively correspond to @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eqb3 ] ) .    on @xmath81-@xmath82 plane , the highest peak can be found around @xmath83 which is characteristic for fcc crystal structure .",
    "we can not find visible shift of the peak position on @xmath84-@xmath85 plane during the collision in both super and ordinary rebounds .",
    "however , we find that the number of `` atoms '' at the highest peak decreases after the collision for ordinary rebounds , which means that the number of `` atoms '' in fcc bond order decreases after the collision ( see table [ tabl_ord ] ) . on the contrary , for super rebounds , the number of `` atoms '' at the highest peak increases after the collision , which means that the fcc bond order becomes intensive after the collision .",
    "thus , the super rebounds are characterized by the increase of the number of `` atoms '' with fcc bond order during collisions ."
