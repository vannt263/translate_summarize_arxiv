    "with such a stringent constraint , many models of low - scale gauge mediation are excluded when the squark masses are required to be rather large to explain the observed higgs boson mass , @xmath2gev  @xcite .",
    "for example , we immediately find that the above upper limit on the gravitino mass excludes models in which the messenger fields couple to supersymmetry breaking sector perturbatively  @xcite .    in this short note , we point out that the low - scale gauge mediation model can explain the observed higgs boson mass even for @xmath3ev when the messenger fields strongly couple to the susy breaking sector .",

    "when the messenger couple to the susy breaking sector strongly , i.e. @xmath39 , on the other hand , the observed higgs boson mass can be explained even for @xmath0ev .",

    ", let us illustrate how the strong coupling between the messenger sector and the susy breaking sector , i.e. @xmath39 is achieved .",
    "when these two sectors are strongly interacting , the vacuum structure of the susy breaking sector is inevitably affected by the coupling to the messenger fields , and in most cases , susy breaking vacua are destabilized . to avoid this problem , we need to assume that the messenger fields couple to a secondary susy breaking as realized in models of  cascade susy breaking \"  @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier works ) .",
    "there , a secondary susy breaking field @xmath44 couples to the primary susy breaking field @xmath10 with @xmath45 only through the khler potential , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the dynamical scale of the susy breaking sector ( see @xcite for more details ) . by using the naive dimensional analysis ( nda )  @xcite , the coefficient @xmath48 is expected to be of @xmath49 when both @xmath10 and @xmath44 take part in the strong dynamics with the dynamical scales of @xmath50 . by using the nda , the primary susy breaking scale is also estimated to be fundamental quarks are of @xmath51 . ]",
    "@xmath52 as a result , the term proportional to @xmath48 leads to a soft susy breaking mass of @xmath44 , for simplicity , although a model in @xcite is viable even for @xmath53 . ]",
    "@xmath54    now , let us suppose that @xmath44 and the messenger fields are composite states of some dynamics so that they couple in the superpotential @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "is achieved in @xcite .",
    "] by the nda again , we expect @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then , the scalar potential of @xmath44 is roughly given by , @xmath59 which leads to the vevs of @xmath44 , @xmath60 putting these vevs into the superpotential in eq.([eq : super2 ] ) , the messenger fields obtain their masses and the mass splittings , @xmath61 which corresponds to @xmath39 . in this way",
    ", we can construct a model in which the messenger fields and the susy breaking couple strongly without causing vacuum stability problem .",
    "so far , in this note , we have confined ourselves to the mssm where the higgs boson mass is explained by the top yukawa radiative corrections . here",
    ", let us comment on the extensions of the susy standard model which can enhance the higgs boson mass without requiring large squark masses .",
    "first , let us consider the so - called nmssm  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) in which a newly introduced singlet field couples to the higgs doublets in the mssm . when the singlet ",
    "higgs coupling is rather large , the observed higgs boson mass can be explained even for relatively light squarks .",
    "however , in the presence of multiple messenger fields , the upper limit on the singlet  higgs coupling from the landau pole problem is severer than in the models without the messenger fields . as a result ,",
    "if we require perturbativity to the nmssm up to the grand unification scale , the higgs boson mass can not be explained in the models with low - scale gauge mediation ( with @xmath62 ) even for the nmssm  @xcite . symmetry . if we allow @xmath63 violating terms , it is possible to explain @xmath64gev without having the landau pole problem .",
    "in such cases , however , we generically suffer from tadpole problem and fine tuning problems . ]    as another example to enhance the higgs boson mass , it is also possible to introduce vector - like matter fields coupling to the higgs doublets  @xcite . in those extensions , however , the more the vector - like matters are added , the severer upper limit on the messenger number from the perturbativity of the mssm gauge coupling constants is put . with fewer messenger fields , the sparticle masses are difficult to be above the lhc constraints for @xmath65ev .    one may also consider the extension of the mssm with an additional @xmath66 gauge symmetry .",
    "in fact , the higgs boson can be enhanced by the associated @xmath67-term potential of the new @xmath66 gauge interaction when the higgs fields are charged under the symmetry  ( * ? ? ? * for review ) . for that purpose , however , we need to require that the soft susy breaking masses of @xmath66 breaking fields should be of the order of the vev of @xmath66 . in view of stringent constraints on @xmath68 gauge bosons put by the lhc searches",
    "@xcite , the required susy breaking mass is at least in a few tev range .",
    "since we are assuming gauge mediation , the soft masses of @xmath66 breaking fields should also be provided by gauge mediation . as a result , for @xmath69tev , it seems not easy to achieve consistent model where @xmath66 extension explains the observed higgs boson mass while keeping the squark masses rather small .",
    "let us also comment on the models with gauge mediation where the higgs doublets and the messenger fields have small mixings  @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "a rather large @xmath70-terms are generated which enhances the higgs boson mass .",
    "as a result , the observed higgs boson mass can be explained for the sparticles masses in a few tev range  @xcite . in such models ,",
    "however , they generically suffer from instability problem of the susy breaking vacuum when the messenger scale is close to the susy breaking scale  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we revisited low - scale gauge mediation models in light of recent observation of cmb lensing and cosmic shear which put a severe upper limit on the gravitino mass , @xmath0ev .",
    "such a stringent constraint excludes wide range models of low - scale gauge mediation when the squark masses are required to be rather large to explain the observed higgs boson mass . in this note , we pointed out that strongly interacting low - scale gauge mediation still survives even if we require that the models satisfy both the observed higgs boson mass and the upper limit on the gravitino mass . we also show that the gravitino mass can not be smaller than about 1ev even when the messenger fields strongly couple to the susy breaking sector .    as an interesting aspect of the strongly coupled low - scale gauge mediation it may naturally provide dark matter candidate , the baryonic composite states in the susy breaking sector or the messenger sector  @xcite .",
    "the baryonic composite states are given by higher dimensional operators , and hence , they couple to the sm particles very weakly . as a result , they are expected to be long lived .",
    "furthermore , the annihilation cross section of the baryonic composite states via strong interaction can saturates the unitarity limit , which requries the dark matter mass of @xmath71tev so that the dark matter density can be explained by the thermal freeze - out  @xcite . therefore",
    ", the baryonic composite states of the strong dynamics at around @xmath71tev in the low - scale gauge mediation naturally explain the observed dark matter density .    taking the thought one step further",
    ", this observation might provide an interesting perspective on the naturalness problem .",
    "let us consider a distribution of the susy breaking scale in the ensemble of vacua ( or theories )  @xcite , which is expected to be biased towards a lower scale for a flat universe . when dark matter is provided as composite states of the strongly coupled low - scale gauge mediation",
    ", the dynamical scale can not be much smaller than @xmath71tev to avoid the lack of dark matter due to a large annihilation cross section .",
    "thus , the final distribution should have a peak at around @xmath71tev , since the scale lower than @xmath71tev is not habitable .",
    "therefore , in this interpretation , the higgs boson mass and rather heavy squark masses are outcomes of the cosmological selection on the dark matter density  @xcite .",
