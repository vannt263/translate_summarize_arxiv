    "an electrostatic trap has been continuously loaded by filtering out the slowest fraction of the molecules present in an effusive beam @xcite .",

    "extremely cold polar molecules such as rbcs can be produced by the photoassociation of two species of ultracold atoms , followed by laser - stimulated state transfer @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the resulting molecules are typically far colder than their environments , and they may be heated by the absorption of blackbody radiation from that environment . unlike atoms , the polar molecules can be rotationally or vibrationally excited by their interaction with this blackbody radiation , and in many cases this can severely limit the trapping lifetime of the molecules . indeed , the blackbody heating rate for trapped oh and od has already been measured experimentally and found to limit the trapping lifetime to just a few seconds when the environment is at room temperature @xcite .",
    "calculations of the free - space heating rates for several polar molecules have already been presented @xcite .    in most experiments so far , the cold polar molecules have been confined in macroscopic traps , with trap surfaces typically several mm from the molecules themselves .",
    "there is now a great deal of interest in confining and manipulating these molecules much closer to surfaces , so as to build a ` molecule chip ' technology analogous to that for atoms @xcite .",
    "fast - moving molecules have already been trapped in travelling potential wells formed approximately 25@xmath0 m above a microstructured surface @xcite .",
    "this same structure can be used to decelerate the molecules to rest so that they can be trapped above the surface of the chip .",
    "chip - based microtraps have been designed , along with schemes to interface the molecules with solid - state devices which could be used to cool , detect and control them coherently @xcite .",
    "strong coupling to a superconducting stripline cavity is possible when the molecules are just a few microns from the surface , and then the molecules can be the long - lived quantum memory of a hybrid quantum information processor @xcite .",

    "the decay rate for an arbitrary environment can be given in terms of the classical green tensor for the respective geometry @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches have been developed on the basis of classical electrodynamics @xcite and microscopic models @xcite and have been applied to the case of an atom near a single surface or between two surfaces .",
    "results for an arbitrary environment of electric @xcite and magneto - electric bodies @xcite , including local - field effects @xcite , have also been obtained on the basis of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and have been used to study atoms in bulk material @xcite , outside @xcite or inside a microsphere @xcite , inside a spherical cavity @xcite and even in the presence of left - handed meta - materials @xcite .",
    "the linear - response approach has been generalised to finite temperatures @xcite where the internal dynamics is no longer governed by spontaneous decay alone , but stimulated emission and absorption of thermal photons also contribute .",
