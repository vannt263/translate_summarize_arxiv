    "the notion of a noninvasive measurement ",
    "a measurement that does not disturb the system being measured  is undisputed in classical physics because one can assign a real physical value to every point in phase space at all times .",
    "even so , the situation becomes complicated if we introduce explicit detectors since these may disturb the system . in quantum physics , the notion of a noninvasive measurement is always problematic @xcite .",
    "one can not assign a value to an observable without discussing the measurement procedure .",
    "strong projective measurements @xcite ( and therefore the majority of general measurements @xcite ) are certainly invasive .",
    "a good candidate for a noninvasive measurement scheme is a _ weak measurement _ @xcite . in general , by reducing the coupling of the detector system to the system under measurement , the invasiveness is reduced at the price of an increased detector noise .",
    "this leads to paradoxes of unusually large values for single measurement results after a subsequent postselection @xcite , or a quasiprobability for the measured distribution after the detector noise has been removed@xcite .",
    "there is growing interest in such measurements @xcite .    in this paper , we answer the question of when our intuitive criteria ( defined below ) of noninvasiveness and time symmetry of measurements are satisfied , for both classical and quantum cases .",
    "time - reversal symmetry of observables is a fundamental symmetry of physics , valid in classical physics and in general  because it is a good symmetry of quantum electrodynamics  in low - energy physics ( in high - energy physics combined with parity and charge conjugation ) .",
    "this symmetry is generally probed by the measurement of single , non - time - resolved measurements , such as the measurement of electric dipole moments of particles .",
    "however , time - reversal symmetry also constrains the results of time - resolved measurements with _",
    "multiple _ measurements . for such considerations",
    ", one must consider the invasiveness of the measurements themselves which will tend to break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "a _ measurement scheme _ is a description of how to measure _",
    "observables_functions of phase space for classical physics or hermitian operators for quantum physics .",
    "a measurement takes place on a _ system under measurement _ which is a member of the _ ensemble under measurement_. as usual , systems of the ensemble are considered to be identically distributed and statistically independent . returning to the _ measurement scheme _ , it should be a description of ( a ) what the detector system is and how it is prepared , ( b ) how the detector system is coupled to the system under measurement , and ( c ) how the detector system is itself measured , and how the measured value is interpreted .",
    "the measurement scheme , essentially a description of the detectors , should be generally independent of the _ ensemble under measurement _ , and only ( b ) , the coupling to the system of interest , should depend on the observable .",
    "also , the measurement of the detector system must be defined in terms of axioms  both classical and quantum ( e.g. by projection postulate ) .",
    "the measurement result should contain the _ inherent _ statistical distribution @xmath0 of the measured system .",
    "the measurement result also contains _ detector noise _",
    "@xmath1 resulting , in an similar fashion , from the statistical and quantum properties of the detector system . by the measurement of many systems from an ensemble",
    ", the probability distribution @xmath2 of the measurement can itself be measured .",
    "the detector noise probability distribution @xmath1 of a _",
    "null measurement_a ` measurement ' where the detector system is prepared but not coupled to the system under measurement  can be determined .",
    "we _ postulate _ that the measurement scheme is expressed by a convolution , @xmath3 and in this case the detector noise may be removed by deconvolution .",
    "the measurement schemes considered in this paper all possess this last property .",
    "we consider time - resolved measurements of observables @xmath4 measured at times @xmath5 , with outcomes @xmath6 occurring with probabilities @xmath7 .",
    "the probability density @xmath0 contains all the information about the experiment and we formulate _ criteria _ for noninvasiveness and time symmetry in terms of @xmath0 , or more exactly , by requiring equality between @xmath0 values measured in different experiments .",
    "an arbitrary operation is non - disturbing if the probability density of other measurements is unchanged by the test operation s addition or removal . in other words , integrating over the single measurement should yield the same distribution that would be obtained if that measurement were never performed .",
    "therefore , our criterion of _ noninvasiveness _ of the @xmath8th measurement reads @xmath9 equation ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) equates probabilities between two different experiments . in the first ,",
    "the @xmath8th measurement is integrated out and in the second , the slash notation indicates that the variable was not measured at all .",
    "this defines noninvasiveness of single measurements on a given experiment .",
    "more generally , if new measurements of observables @xmath10 can be inserted at intermediate times without changing the previous probability density as in ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) then the all of them are noninvasive .",
    "the noninvasiveness is stronger if ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) is satisfied for a fixed @xmath11 but arbitrary other measurements .",
    "we assume that time reversal is a good symmetry for the equations of motion of the system and investigate whether this leads to a corresponding symmetry expressed in the results of measurements performed on the system .",
    "we should note that time reversal symmetry holds only for nondissipative , hamiltonian systems .",
    "however , physical dissipation is always a result of ignoring fast - changing and fine - grained degrees of freedom , often modeled by a heat bath coupled weakly to the system .",
    "if one had access to all the degrees of freedom and the heat bath , one could reverse the full phase space probability and restore time symmetry . even if it is not practically possible to reverse fine - grained degrees of freedom ,",
    "an alternate solution is to restrict ourselves to states in equilibrium coupled to a heat bath , which are time - symmetric themselves in the thermodynamic limit .    to express the expected time - reversal symmetry of a set of measurements , we begin by denoting the time - reversed version of an object @xmath12 by @xmath13 , i.e. , position : @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15",
    "the time - reversed experiment involves the time reversed initial state @xmath16 , time - reversed measured quantities @xmath17 with results @xmath18 , and also reversed time  and therefore , ordering  of the measurements .",
    "hence , for the probability @xmath0 , our criterion of _ time symmetry of measurements _ reads @xmath19 where we compare the probability densities of the forward ( @xmath0 ) and reversed ( @xmath20 ) sets of measurements .",
    "in such a form , classically ( [ tsym ] ) holds for equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems and is independent of the validity of charge conjugation and parity symmetries and also of relativistic invariance @xcite . when fulfilled  assuming for the moment that the measurements are non - invasive  the result ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) leads to the principle of detailed balance@xcite and reciprocity of thermodynamic fluxes @xcite .",
    "the above criteria ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) and ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) must be confronted with real detection protocols . for each measurement",
    ", there is a detection protocol that includes some interaction between the original system and an ancilla that is later decoupled with the imprinted information retrieved from the system .",
    "we should add the remark that the internal dynamics of the detector may be irreversible , but this is irrelevant , because we ask only about the behavior of the system .",
    "note also that , for the time symmetry to hold , the measurements should not disturb the system in the sense of the criterion ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) , since any disturbance would create an asymmetry between before and after the measurement .",
    "the majority of measurements are invasive and irreversible , both classical and quantum .",
    "however , there exists a special class of measurements , defined both classically and quantum mechanically , which are noninivasive under certain conditions .",
    "they are described by an instantaneous interaction between the system and detector @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the measured observable , @xmath23 is the detector s momentum and @xmath24 is the coupling strength ( see details later in the text ) .",
    "the initial state of the detector is the zero mean gaussian .",
    "the observer finally registers the position which is shifted by @xmath25 .",
    "the result contains also the internal detection noise , which is subtracted / deconvoluted .",
    "for all _ finite _ @xmath24 the scheme is invasive , except if the observables are compatible ( vanishing poisson bracket or commutator ) or if initially @xmath26 , which makes sense only classically ( we do not want divergent position ) .",
    "however , the scheme becomes noninvasive ( both classically and quantum ) _ in the limit _",
    "@xmath27 , while rescaling the detector s result by @xmath28  this is the _ weak measurement _ @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , classical and quantum weak measurements differ with respect to time symmetry ( [ tsym ] ) .",
    "the behavior of different types of measurements is summarized in table [ tab_mes ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain the origin of this difference between classical and quantum measurements .",
    "we will also show the asymmetry explicitly by giving an example of a measurement of a simple two - level system and propose an experimentally feasible realization by charge measurements on a quantum dot connected to a reservoir .",
    ".different types of measurements may satisfy noninvasiveness and/or time symmetry .",
    "the exceptions include position and/or momentum measurement in a simple harmonic oscillator , two - time correlations and other accidental symmetries or quasiclassical systems . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we will show in next sections that in the _ classical _ weak measurement limit one can find @xmath29 where the average @xmath30 is taken in the initial state @xmath31 in the phase space @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes a classical analogue of the heisenberg picture for the observable @xmath22 .",
    "this clearly satisfies noninvasiveness and time symmetry , because @xmath22 are commuting numbers and we can reorder them under time reversal .",
    "now , in the quantum case , we will get @xmath34 for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 with the initial density matrix @xmath31 .",
    "the superoperators act as @xmath37 , for the observable operator @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity is no longer a probability but a quasiprobability @xcite and still satisfies noninvasiveness ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) .",
    "however , the time symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) is violated , except for compatible measurements ( e.g. space - like separated@xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , this is because we replace the classical @xmath38-number multiplication ( obviously a commuting operation ) by the quantum anticommutator of operators ( therefore noncommuting ) . we can not reorder superoperators @xmath39 under time reversal .    for slow measurements ,",
    "each operator @xmath33 in ( [ qaq ] ) is replaced with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 turns on and off slowly compared to relevant timescales of the system .",
    "this slow measuring smoothes the resulting distribution @xmath0 so that any antisymmetric contributions vanish and therefore time symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) will still apply . roughly speaking ,",
    "the more classical is the system , the more time - symmetric it is .",
    "the time symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) can be tested by comparing moments of the distribution , @xmath42 we emphasize that the quantities in ( [ eq : t_moments ] ) are expectation values of products of measurement results , and should not be confused with expectation values of observables in an ensemble .",
    "the ordering of @xmath43 to @xmath44 is mathematically irrelevant , but serves as a reminder of the ordering of measurements in the experiment .",
    "linear correlations of quantum weak measurements  in the limit of zero measurement strength  are given by @xcite @xmath45 we can freely permute the @xmath46 in the left hand side but not the @xmath39 in the right hand side ( they do not commute and the order reflects that @xmath35 ) . this asymmetry is only present for fast measurements of three or more incompatible observables .",
    "this does not need a specific system .",
    "in contrast , only specific systems and observables do not show the asymmetry ; one such an exception is e.g. position measurement in a simple harmonic oscillator . in the case of",
    "compatible or only two ( not necessarily compatible ) measurements the ordering is irrelevant and the symmetry ( [ eq : t_moments ] ) holds .",
    "let us take a classical system with the probability density @xmath47 in phase space @xmath48 with @xmath49 being a pair of canonical generalized position and momentum .",
    "the evolution is given by the hamiltonian @xmath50 and can be expressed compactly using the liouville operator @xmath51 , defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53\\ ] ] is the poisson bracket .",
    "one has @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider a direct sequential measurement of quantities @xmath56 measured at times @xmath57 , with the results @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the probability distribution is naturally postulated as @xmath59 alternatively , it can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the above quantity coincides with ( [ cac ] ) , is positive and normalized so it is a normal probability .",
    "as we already noted , it satisfies noninvasiveness ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) and time symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) .",
    "now , the quantum direct measurement is governed by the projection postulate @xcite .",
    "it is obviously invasive , violates ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) and ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) , which is not at all surprising . looking for quantum noninvasiveness , we have to abandon direct measurements @xcite .",
    "since we want to compare classical and quantum noninvasive measurements , we will consider indirect measurements both classical and quantum .",
    "let us now construct a model of a weak measurement which functions both classically and quantum mechanically@xcite .",
    "we have no direct access to the quantity @xmath22 at time @xmath62 but we couple a detector for an instant .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian , added to the system , reads @xmath63 where @xmath23 is the detector s momentum , and @xmath24 is the measurement s strength .",
    "we will use a very compact notation that highlights quantum - classical analogies and differences .",
    "this is why many formulae below apply both to classical and quantum cases , with differences only in the mathematical objects ( e.g. numbers or operators , phase - space density or density matrix , operator or superoperator ) .",
    "the quantum liouville superoperator reads @xmath64/\\rmi\\hbar$ ] ( commutator @xmath65=ab - ba$ ] ) . as in the classical evolution of phase space density , operators in the heisenberg picture evolve as @xmath61 . for a single measurement ,",
    "the total initial state is a product @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the state of the detector .",
    "after the measurement , the total density is @xmath68 where classically @xmath69 ( multiplication by @xmath22 ) , quantum - mechanically @xmath70 ( anticommutator @xmath71 ) , and the ( super)operator @xmath72 is given classically by @xmath73 , and quantum mechanically by @xmath74/\\rmi\\hbar$ ] . for a more conventional approach ,",
    "see appendix a. note that classically @xmath75 for the canonically conjugated @xmath76 .",
    "the analogy between classical poisson brackets and quantum commutators was recognized in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the novel analogy here is between the classical multiplication by an observable and the quantum anticommutator .",
    "the fact that we replace a ( commuting ) number by a ( noncommuting ) superoperator helps to understand why quantum weak measurements do not obey time symmetry while classical weak measurements do .",
    "if we discard the results of the measurement then the resulting density reads @xmath77 , where the average denotes @xmath78 classically and @xmath79 quantum mechanically ( subscript @xmath80 denotes detector s subspace ) .",
    "the procedure can be repeated for sequential measurements as depicted in figure [ weakm ] .",
    "we take the initial state of the detector given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 are a pair of conjugate canonical observables ( with the property @xmath83 or @xmath84=\\rmi\\hbar$ ] ) .",
    "this is a generic symmetric gaussian state .",
    "if measured classically the initial variances read @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "quantum mechanically ( under projective measurement ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 . note that for @xmath89 they reduce to the classical result while @xmath90 is imposed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "we register directly the value of @xmath76",
    ". however , the way of measuring of @xmath76 is in principle irrelevant , both classical and quantum , and may be well disturbing because the detector will not interact with the system anymore .",
    "the detector ( classical or quantum ) can evolve irreversibly , we are only interested in the data extracted from the system .",
    "we apply a sequence of such measurements , using identical , independent detectors @xmath91 , but coupled at different times to possibly different observables .",
    "it is convenient to define a _",
    "result - conditioned _ density @xmath92 , normalized by the final _ result - integrated _ density @xmath93 .",
    "the probability density of a given sequence of results is given by @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "now , @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 where @xmath1 is the zero - mean gaussian noise with the variance @xmath98 .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 reads @xmath100 this is classically a standard probability density but not a positive definite density matrix in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is clear when defining @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "now the quantum @xmath103 is only a quasiprobability @xcite .",
    "one can write down the convolution relation analogous to ( [ roconv ] ) , @xmath104 both @xmath105 and @xmath103 have a well - defined limit @xmath27 , @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". then ( [ qweak ] ) reduces to ( [ qdef ] ) classically . in the quantum case , @xmath108 with @xmath109 or equivalently @xmath110 , which coincides with ( [ qaq ] ) .",
    "the effect of disturbance ( both classical and quantum ! ) is of the order @xmath111 so it vanishes in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "one can relate correlation functions @xmath112 the leading contribution to such correlation functions is of the order @xmath113 , while the lowest correction due to disturbance is of the order @xmath114 , as follows from ( [ roconv ] ) and ( [ qweak ] ) .",
    "both classical and quantum @xmath0 satisfy noninvasiveness ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) , but only in the @xmath27 limit .",
    "there are exceptions when noninvasiveness holds for an arbitrary @xmath24 .",
    "in particular @xmath115 is independent of @xmath24 and always a real positive probability for _ compatible _ observables  if @xmath116 classically or @xmath117=0 $ ] quantum mechanically for all @xmath118 .",
    "we emphasize that the deconvolved result - conditioned density @xmath119 ( [ qweak ] ) changes with each measurement because it gets the factor @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "this is because it must contain the read - off knowledge ( it is gaining information  not disturbance ) .",
    "it is impossible to preserve the result - conditioned density unchanged by any measurement , both classical or quantum ( unless the measurement is void )  in this sense all measurements would be invasive .",
    "hence , only after integration it makes sense to distinguish between invasive and noninvasive measurements .    from ( [ roconv ] ) and ( [ qweak ] ) we see also that the result - integrated density after a single weak measurement gets the factor @xmath122 , which reduces to identity in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "this is why weak measurements ( both classical and quantum ) are noninvasive in a stronger sense : their disturbance vanishes as @xmath111 regardless of the type of measurements before / after . for a comparison ,",
    "strong measurements of compatible observables are mutually noninvasive but we can find an incompatible observable whose results they disturb .",
    "the price of weak measurements is that one has to repeat the experiment @xmath123 times to get the weak signal out of statistics .",
    "note also that the scaling @xmath124 is analogous in the classical and quantum cas . in the classical case",
    ", however , one can take @xmath125 , which makes the limit @xmath27 unnecessary .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle allows only for the limiting noninvasiveness .",
    "one could argue ( both classically and quantum ) that there is still some invasiveness for large results because the result - conditioned density @xmath92 is affected by different factors for different values of @xmath22 .",
    "namely , @xmath126 can be large even for small @xmath24 .",
    "however , this requires @xmath127 which happens very rarely for small @xmath24 , with the estimated probability of the rapidly vanishing gaussian tail @xmath128 so it is irrelevant for the discussion of noninvasiveness .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 also contains the read - off knowledge , although rescaled by @xmath24 , while only the change of result - integrated @xmath129 is quantifies invasiveness",
    ".      one may ask whether it is possible to enforce time - symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) in any other measurements scheme .",
    "unfortunately , we would pay a high price  abandoning causality of measurements .",
    "all general quantum measurements appear in a _ causal _ way , @xmath130 with normalized completely positive maps @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "even more generally p(q)=t[a , q ] , where @xmath132 denotes time ordering of superoperators that depend on observables @xmath33 in heisenberg picture .",
    "now , every causal measurement of non - zero strength is disturbing ( weak measurements from section 3 create a disturbance @xmath133 ) but only _ forward _ in time .",
    "if we measure at @xmath134 then the measurement @xmath135 disturbs @xmath136 , the measurement @xmath137 disturbs only @xmath138 and the last disturbs only itself .",
    "if there existed any measurement scheme with the time - symmetric limit ( with a vanishing parameter analogous to @xmath24 ) then it would have also time - symmetric disturbance at finite strength  violating causality .",
    "however , if we give up the above rule or are satisfied by only limiting causality ( at @xmath139 ) we can e.g. define q(a)=_k(a_k - a_k(t_k))_k .",
    "the corresponding map @xmath140 for @xmath141 measurements reads k(q)=(2)^-n/4 ^_k ( 2ga_k(t_k)q_k - q_k^2)/4 ^ 1/2 , where @xmath142 denotes the rule of complete symmetrization of operator products in taylor expansion .",
    "the probability @xmath143 is related to @xmath0 by ( [ roconv ] ) with @xmath144 .",
    "it is perfectly time - symmetric but the disturbance is time symmetric , too , for @xmath145 . in this work ,",
    "we have not considered this option , because all known experimental detection schemes confirm causality .",
    "let us demonstrate the paradox in a simple system consisting of a particle in a double - well potential as in figure  [ dwell ] . for simplicity , we take an equilibrium state , but the asymmetry appears also in a completely general case .",
    "the particle is effectively described by the ground states of the left and right wells , @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "higher excited states have much more energy and for low temperatures can be ignored , leaving an effective two - state system . using the basis states , the operator for expected location is @xmath148 , and the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the energy difference between wells and @xmath151 is the tunneling amplitude . for low - energy physics ,",
    "time reversal alone is already a good symmetry in the equations of motion so , in absence external magnetic field , the equilibrium state is time symmetric .",
    "hence , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are even under time reversal ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) .",
    "we are now in a position to test equation ( [ eq : t_moments ] ) with @xmath156 measured at three separate times and with the initial thermal state @xmath157 . the correlation for three weak measurements",
    "can be calculated using ( [ tinor ] ) and @xmath158 : @xmath159 where @xmath160 , @xmath161 . for this system and measurements , the expression corresponding to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : t_moments ] ) differs from ( [ quantum_dot_result ] ) only by the exchange of @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "however , ( [ quantum_dot_result ] ) is clearly asymmetric under this exchange , demonstrating that time - reversal symmetry is broken for correlations of quantum weak measurements . as a side note , it can be shown that the correlation ( [ quantum_dot_result ] ) is independent of measurement strength ; however , this coincidence does not hold in general .     and @xmath147 , with energy shift @xmath150 and tunneling amplitude @xmath151 .",
    "even in the ground state , quantum fluctuations allow jumps between the wells , which turn to be non - time symmetric under weak measurement . ]      despite the simplicity of the above example , a genuine , fast weak detection scheme is probably difficult to implement experimentally in this case .",

    "such an experiment will confirm the time - reversal symmetry violation only if the dot is not driven out of equilibrium .",
    "it is always possible for a certain parameter range  see appendix b for the detailed model .",
    "note that the dynamics of the detector here is clearly irreversible as it is initially in a nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "however , we are only interested in the behavior of the system . anyway , in the range of frequencies of possible asymmetry , @xmath206 is frequency - independent , so the asymmetry of @xmath207 will show asymmetry of @xmath208 .",
    "we have shown that neither noninvasiveness ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) nor time symmetry ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) is automatically satisfied in the results of measurements , both classical and quantum .",
    "only a subclass of detection schemes , parameterized by the measurement strength @xmath24 , may satisfy ( [ eq : noninvasivedefinition ] ) and/or ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) .",
    "classically , the measurement can be strictly noninvasive either at a finite @xmath24 and zero detector s momentum or in the weak measurement limit , @xmath27 .",
    "however , quantum noninvasiveness is satisfied only in a the limit of zero strength @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the time symmetry of measurements ( [ eq : timesymmetryofmeasurements ] ) is broken in the quantum case , in contrast to classical mechanics .",
    "this is the fundamental difference between classical and quantum noninvasive measurements .",
    "one could argue that the weak measurement still affects the system and forces a time direction in this way .",
    "on the other hand , one expects a natural limit in which the influence on the system is negligible and the time symmetry should hold .",
    "this violation is effectively a failure of weak measurements to accurately reflect the time - reversal symmetry inherent in a system . as such , it is independent of the validity of other symmetries such as charge parity time . since quantum measurements of finite strength",
    "manifestly break time - reversal invariance , our result shows that , in contrast to classical measurements , all quantum measurements break time - reversal invariance regardless of their strength .",
    "weak measurements are then still disturbing in some sense , although they do not disturb the state or later measurements .",
    "our result shows not only the quantum violation of time symmetry , but also the importance of a classical - quantum analogy of detection schemes .",
    "an open question is to what extent the analogy is correct .",
    "for instance , maybe not all system - detector interactions are allowed and possibly they can not be instantaneous but rather time - extended .",
    "this needs further research , referring also to realistic experimental detection schemes .",
    "we are grateful to bertand reulet , christoph bruder and tomasz dietl for helpful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the dfg through sfb 767 and sp 1285 and by the polish ministry of science grant ip2011 002371 ( to ab ) .",
    "to justify ( [ tinor ] ) we consider a series of weak measurements .",
    "following aharonov _",
    "@xcite , each weak measurement introduces an ancilla system and creates entanglement via an instant interaction hamiltonian @xmath209 where @xmath24 is the strength of interaction , @xmath210 is momentum operator of the ancilla , conjugate to position @xmath211 ( @xmath212=i\\hbar$ ] ) , and @xmath213 is the measured observable .",
    "the interaction is followed by von neumann projection @xcite of the ancilla onto a position eigenstate which destroys the ancilla .",
    "the system can however be measured again with the next ancilla , as shown in figure  [ weakm ] .",
    "the density matrix after the @xmath214^th^ measurement is @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the initial prepared state of ancilla @xmath214 . by inserting identity operations @xmath217 ,",
    "the measurement interaction can be expressed as shifts of the ancilla wavefunction , @xmath218 in ( [ eq : weak_rho_recursive_with_idents ] ) , the the state of ancilla @xmath214 which has the shifted wavefunction @xmath219 is written as @xmath220 .",
    "the joint probability @xmath221 is the probability of measuring the ancillas in a set of position eigenstates with positions given by @xmath222 @xmath223 in ( [ eq : joint_prob_with_integrals ] ) , @xmath224 is defined recursively by @xmath225 using gaussian wavefunctions @xmath226 , a change of variables to @xmath227 and @xmath228 separates the joint probability density into a quasiprobability signal ( @xmath0 ) and detector noise ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath229 equation  ( [ eq : weak_measurements_quasiprobability ] ) defined the joint quasiprobability density @xmath0 for the series of von neumann measurements .",
    "the quasiprobability has a well - defined limit @xmath27 . in this limit for time - resolved measurement ,",
    "the averages with respect to this quasiprobability are given by @xmath230 which is equivalent to ( [ tinor ] ) .",
    "the genuine , measured probability @xmath231 is positive definite because it contains also the large detection noise @xmath232 which is gaussian , white and completely independent of the system , compared to the signal @xmath233 .",
    "an alternative , equivalent approach is based on gaussian positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) and special kraus operators @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the basic properties of povm .",
    "the kraus operators @xmath234 for an observable described by @xmath213 with continuous outcome @xmath46 need only satisfy @xmath235 .",
    "the act of measurement on the state defined by the density matrix @xmath236 results in the new state @xmath237 .",
    "the new state yields a normalized and positive definite probability density @xmath238 .",
    "the procedure can be repeated recursively for an arbitrary sequence of ( not necessarily commuting ) operators @xmath239 , @xmath240 the corresponding probability density is given by @xmath241 .",
    "we now define a family of kraus operators , namely @xmath242 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath243 should correspond to exact , strong , projective measurement , while @xmath27 is a weak measurement and gives a large error .",
    "in fact , these kraus operators are exactly those associated with the von neumann measurements previously described .",
    "we also see that strong projection changes the state ( by collapse ) , while @xmath27 gives @xmath244 , and hence this case corresponds to weak measurement .",
    "however , the repetition of the same measurement @xmath8 times effectively means one measurement with @xmath245 so , with @xmath246 , even a weak coupling @xmath247 results in a strong measurement . for an arbitrary sequence of measurements , we can write the final density matrix as the convolution @xmath248 with @xmath249 . here",
    "@xmath250 @xmath251 , and @xmath252 .",
    "the quasi - density matrix @xmath253 is given recursively by @xmath254 with the initial density matrix @xmath255 for @xmath256 .",
    "we can interpret @xmath257 in ( [ conv ] ) as some internal noise of the detectors which , in the limit @xmath27 , should not influence the system . we _",
    "define _ the quasiprobability @xcite @xmath258 and abbreviate @xmath259 . in this limit ( [ quasi ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath260 note that @xmath261 , so the last measurement does not need to be weak ( it can be even a projection ) .",
    "the averages with respect to @xmath0 are easily calculated by means of the generating function ( [ gene ] ) , e.g. @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 for @xmath265 . as a straightforward generalization to continuous measurement",
    ", we obtain @xmath266 for time ordered observables , @xmath267 .",
    ", coupled capacitively to the measured dot . the fluctuations of the current @xmath199 in the junction biased by the voltage @xmath268 depend on the dot s occupation @xmath167 with the proportionality constant @xmath202 . ]    an effective model of weakly detecting the dot s charge using an electric junction is shown in fig .  [ qpc ] .",
    "the junction is treated as another dot between two reservoirs but in a broad level regime .",
    "the complete hamiltonian , consisting of the dot part ( [ hdot ] ) , and the junction part , reads @xmath269,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hat{n}_l=\\hat{\\psi}_l^{\\dag}(e)\\hat{\\psi}_l(e),\\:\\hat{n}'=\\hat{d}^{\\dag}\\hat{d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath270 is the total number of elementary charges @xmath271 in the left reservoir , @xmath272 is the capacitance between the dot and the qpc , @xmath273,@xmath274 denote effective tunneling rate and level energy of the qpc and @xmath268 is the bias voltage .",
    "we measure current fluctuations in the junction , @xmath275 , with the current in heisenberg picture defined as @xmath276 .",
    "such fluctuations have already been measured experimentally at low and high frequencies @xcite .",
    "most of fluctuations are just generated by the shot noise in the junction .",
    "now , we consider a finite , but still very large capacitance .",
    "we expect a contribution from the system dot s charge fluctuation to @xmath277 of the order @xmath278 .",
    "we assume separation of the system s and detector s characteristic frequency scales , namely @xmath279 which also includes the broad level approximation for the detector s dot .",
    "there exists a special parameter range , @xmath280 where the coupling is strong enough to extract information about @xmath281 which is not blurred by feedback and cross - correlation terms ( left inequality ) , but weak enough not to drive the system dot out of equilibrium ( right inequality ) . in this limit the dominating contributions to the detector current s third cumulant are given by @xmath203 with @xmath282 where @xmath283 and effective transmission @xmath284 .",
    "although the @xmath285 term in @xmath286 is much smaller than the first one , other terms , corresponding to cross correlations and back action , are negligible compared to the last term .",
