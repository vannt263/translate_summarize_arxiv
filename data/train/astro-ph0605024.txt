    "the pulsation detected in the blackbody component also suggests the accretion column origin of the soft excess .",

    "( 2004 ) have argued against a accretion column origin of the soft excess from the point of view of brightness temperature .",
    "broad - band phase - averaged spectroscopy of ks  1947 + 300  shows the presence of a weak and narrow 6.7 kev iron emission line with equivalent width in the range of 5585 ev .",

    "the 6.7 kev line is identified as emission from helium like iron .",

    "( 1987 ) showed that the emission lines with energies @xmath11 6.63 kev are emitted by recombination and subsequent cascades , whereas the lines with energies @xmath15 6.63 kev are due to x - ray fluorescence .    as the mecs detectors of _ bepposax",
    "_  do not have sufficient spectral resolution to identify the exact ionization state of iron by separating the lines at energies 6.63 kev , 6.67 kev and 6.70 kev as seen in lmxbs , x - ray observations of ks  1947 + 300  with instruments having better spectral resolution ( chandra ) are required to investigate the presence of such lines in the energy spectrum .",
    "these observations may also explain the absence / presence of the soft excess over the comptonized continuum model at the peak of the outburst .",
    "the absence of any cyclotron resonance absorption feature in the phase averaged spectra of ks  1947 + 300  implies the cyclotron line lies outside the 0.1 - 100.0 kev energy band .",

    "<S> the dip in the pulse profile shows a very strong energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> broad - band pulse - phase - averaged spectroscopy obtained with three of the _ bepposax _  instruments shows that the energy spectrum in the 0.1100 kev energy band has three components , a comptonized component , a @xmath0 0.6 kev blackbody component , and a narrow and weak iron emission line at 6.7 kev with a low column density of material in the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we place an upper limit on the equivalent width of the iron @xmath1 line at 6.4 kev of @xmath0 13 ev ( for a width of 100 ev ) . assuming a spherical blackbody emitting region and the distance of the source to be 10 kpc , the radius of the emitting region is found to be in the range of 1422 km , which rules out the inner accretion disk as the soft x - ray emitting region . </S>"
