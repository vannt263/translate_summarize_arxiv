    "gaia is the astrophysics mission selected as cornerstone  6 in the esa science programme .",
    "the acronym has many interpretations , with galactic astrophysics through imaging and astrometry being most apt .",
    "gaia builds upon the observational techniques pioneered and proven by esa s hipparcos mission to solve one of the most difficult yet deeply fundamental challenges in modern astronomy : to create an extremely precise three - dimensional map of a representative sample of stars throughout our galaxy and beyond . in the process , by combining positional data with complementary radial velocities , gaia will map the stellar motions , which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the galaxy . through comprehensive photometric classification , gaia will provide the detailed physical properties of each star observed : characterizing their luminosity , temperature , gravity , and elemental composition . this massive multi - parameter stellar census will provide the basic observational data to quantify the origin , structure , and evolutionary history of our galaxy , the primary science goal of the gaia mission .",
    "gaia will achieve this by repeatedly measuring the positions and multi - colour brightnesses of all objects down to @xmath0  mag . on - board object detection will ensure that variable stars , supernovae , transient sources , micro - lensed events , and minor planets will all be detected and catalogued to this faint limit .",
    "final accuracies of 10  microarcsec at 15  mag , comparable to the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 1000  km , will provide distances accurate to 10  per cent as far as the galactic centre , 30000 light years away .",
    "stellar motions will be measured even in the andromeda galaxy .",
    "the range of scientific topics which will be addressed by the gaia data is vast , covering much of modern astrophysics , and fundamental physics . in this section",
    "we present a few illustrative examples , to give the flavour of the mission capabilities , with scientific applications ranging from the milky way galaxy , stellar astrophysics , solar system minor bodies , and extra - galactic studies , to fundamental physics .",
    "further details are available on the gaia www site http://astro.estec.esa.nl/gaia .",
    "documents there contain references to the original work briefly summarised here , as well as details of the many other exciting scientific projects which gaia will address , but which space precludes discussion of here .",
    "understanding the galaxy in which we live is one of the great intellectual challenges facing modern science .",
    "the milky way contains a complex mix of stars , planets , interstellar gas and dust , radiation , and the ubiquitous dark matter .",
    "these components are widely distributed in age ( reflecting their birth rate ) , in space ( reflecting their birth places and subsequent motions ) , on orbits ( determined by the gravitational force generated by their own mass ) , and with chemical element abundances ( determined by the past history of star formation and gas accretion ) .",
    "astrophysics has now developed the tools to measure these distributions in space , kinematics , and chemical abundance , and to interpret the distribution functions to map , and to understand , the formation , structure , evolution , and future of our galaxy .",
    "this potential understanding is also of profound significance for quantitative studies of the high - redshift universe : a well - studied nearby template underpins analysis of unresolved galaxies with other facilities , and at other wavelengths .",
    "understanding the structure and evolution of a galaxy requires three complementary observational approaches : ( i ) a census of the contents of a large , representative , part of the galaxy ; ( ii ) quantification of the present spatial structure , from distances ; ( iii ) knowledge of the three - dimensional space motions , to determine the gravitational field and the stellar orbits .",
    "that is , one requires complementary astrometry , photometry , and radial velocities .",
    "astrometric measurements uniquely provide model independent distances and transverse kinematics , and form the base of the cosmic distance scale .",
    "photometry , with appropriate astrometric and astrophysical calibration , gives a knowledge of extinction , and hence , combined with astrometry , provides intrinsic luminosities , spatial distribution functions , and stellar chemical abundance and age information .",
    "radial velocities complete the kinematic triad , allowing determination of gravitational forces , and the distribution of invisible mass .",
    "the combination of vast continuing ground - based radial velocity projects and hipparcos did this for one location in the milky way , the solar neighbourhood ; gaia will accomplish this for a large fraction of our galaxy .",
    "gaia will measure not only the local kinematics with much improved accuracy , but the full six - dimensional stellar distribution function throughout a large part of the galactic disk .",
    "this will allow not only a determination of the gravitational potential of the galaxy and its distribution function , but also reveal how much a given stellar population deviates from dynamical equilibrium .",
    "this in turn will constrain the formation history of the galactic disk and its components , e.g. , the past variations of pattern speed and strength of the central bar and spiral arms .",
    "we note here a few of the many important and challenging science cases , all of which require gaia s faint limiting magnitude , and which illustrate gaia s study of the galactic bulge , disk , and halo .",
    "bulge stars are predominantly moderately old , unlike the present - day disk ; they encompass a wide abundance range , peaking near the solar value , as does the disk ; and they have very low specific angular momentum , similar to stars in the halo .",
    "thus the bulge is , in some fundamental parameters , unlike both disk and halo .",
    "what is its history ?",
    "is it a remnant of a disk instability ?",
    "is it a successor or a precursor to the stellar halo ?",
    "is it a merger remnant ?",
    "it is not clear whether the formation of the bulge preceded that of the disk , as predicted by ` inside - out ' scenarios ; or whether it happened simultaneously with the formation of the disk , by accretion of dwarf galaxies ; or whether it followed the formation of the disk , as a result of the dynamical evolution of a bar .",
    "large - scale surveys of proper motions and photometric data inside the bulge can cast light on the orbital distribution function . knowing the distance , the true space velocities and orbits can be derived , thus providing constraints on current dynamical theories of formation .",
    "gaia data for bulge stars , providing intrinsic luminosities , metallicity , and numbers , can be inverted to deduce star formation histories .",
    "the highly accurate parallaxes , proper motions and magnitudes acquired by gaia for more than @xmath1 stars per square degree , will allow the vast majority of red and asymptotic giant branch stars , and a significant fraction of the clump stars in baade s window to be measured with a precision higher than 1015  per cent . with @xmath0 as the limiting magnitude , red and asymptotic giant branch stars can be detected over a range of 5  mag .",
    "there is substantial evidence that the bulge is not axisymmetric , but instead has a triaxial shape seen nearly end - on .",
    "indications for this come from the asymmetric near - infrared light distribution , star counts , the atomic and molecular gas morphology and kinematics , and the large optical depth to micro - lensing .",
    "the actual shape , orientation , and scale - length of the bulge , and the possible presence of an additional bar - like structure in the disk plane , however remain a matter of debate . the reason why it is so difficult to derive the shape of the galactic bar is that three - dimensional distributions can not be uniquely recovered from projected surface brightness distributions such as the cobe / dirbe maps .",
    "in addition , bars with the same density distribution could have different pattern speeds .",
    "no unique solution can be found using only one - velocity component diagrams , unless the gravitational potential is known , since the velocity dispersion in the star motions smears out the effects of the bar on the distribution function .",
    "gaia proper motions to faint magnitudes , in particular in a number of low - extinction windows , will allow unambiguous determination of the shape , orientation , tumbling rate mass profile and star formation history of the bulge .",
    "the large - scale kinematics of the galaxy also contains an imprint of the non - axisymmetric central potential .",
    "the stellar halo of the galaxy contains only a small fraction of its total luminous mass , but the kinematics and abundances of halo stars , globular clusters , and the dwarf satellites contain imprints of the formation of the entire milky way .",
    "the most metal - deficient stars , with [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 , represent a powerful tool to understand primordial abundances and the nature of the objects which produced the first heavy elements .",
    "[ [ halo - streams ] ] halo streams + + + + + + + + + + + +    the halo of the milky way is likely to be the most important component that may be used to distinguish among competing scenarios for the formation of our galaxy .",
    "the classical picture of inner monolithic collapse with later accretion in the outer galaxy , predicts a smooth distribution both in configuration and velocity space for our solar neighbourhood , which is consistent with the available observational data .",
    "the currently popular hierarchical cosmologies propose that big galaxies are formed by mergers and accretion of smaller building blocks , and many of its predictions seem to be confirmed in high - redshift studies .    those merging and accretion events leave signatures in the phase - space distribution of the stars that once formed those systems .",
    "helmi etal have shown that , after 10  billion years , the spatial distribution of stars in the inner halo should be fairly uniform , whereas strong clumping is expected in velocity space .",
    "this clumping appears in the form of a very large number of moving groups ( several hundred in a 1  kpc@xmath3 volume centered on the sun , if the whole stellar halo were built in this way ) each having very small velocity dispersions and containing several hundred stars .",
    "the required velocity accuracies to detect individual streams are less than a few  km  s@xmath4 , requiring measurement precision of order @xmath5 .",
    "[ [ the - outer - halo ] ] the outer halo + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    gaia will find several million individual stars in the outer halo ( defined here as galactocentric distance @xmath6  kpc ) . these will mostly be g and k giants and red and blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "g and k giants are intrinsically bright , they form in all known old stellar population types , they have easily measurable radial velocities , and they are historically well studied because they are the most easily accessible stars in the globular clusters .",
    "horizontal branch stars have been the preferred tracer stellar type for the outer halo to date , because they can be much more easily identified amongst field stars than g and k giants . in particular , blue horizontal branch stars have been very easy to locate , since almost all faint ( @xmath7  mag ) , blue @xmath8 ) stars are halo blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "however these stars are a biased tracer of the halo population in the sense that they do not always form in old metal weak populations ( viz .  the second parameter problem in globular clusters ) .",
    "redder horizontal branch stars and g and k halo giants are drowned out by the huge numbers of foreground turnoff and dwarf stars in the galactic disk .",
    "gaia will circumvent all these difficulties .",
    "the late - type foreground dwarfs are much closer than the background late - type giants , so that at faint magnitudes ( @xmath9  mag ) the dwarfs have a measurable parallax while the background giants do not . it will be possible to lift the veil of foreground stars and reveal of order millions of background halo stars , on the giant branch , and the red and blue horizontal branch .",
    "we note here just two of the many aspects of this science gaia will explore .",
    "[ [ galactic - disk - warps ] ] galactic disk warps + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    galactic disks are thin , but they are not flat .",
    "approximately one - half of all spiral galaxies have disks which warp significantly out of the plane defined by the inner galaxy .",
    "remarkably , there is no realistic explanation of this common phenomenon , though the large - scale structure of the dark matter , and tidal interactions , must be important , as the local potential at the warp must be implicated .",
    "neither the origin nor the persistence of galaxy warps is understood , and insufficient information exists to define empirically the relative spatial and kinematic distributions of the young ( ob ) stars which should trace the gas distribution , and the older ( gkm ) stars which define a more time - averaged gravitational field .    the expected kinematic pattern ( at least , in existing plausible models ) is most strongly constrained by the straightness of the line of nodes : these should wind up in at most a few rotation times , typically less than 2  gyr . a relevant shear pattern corresponds to systematic motions dependant on warp phase and galactocentric distance superimposed on galactic rotation .",
    "a plausible velocity amplitude associated with the warp at the optical disk edge is significantly less than @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the disk rotation angular velocity .",
    "this will be distributed between latitude and longitude contributions depending on the local geometric projection .    at @xmath12  kpc , for a flat rotation curve",
    ", the systematic disk rotation corresponds to 6  mas  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the kinematic signature from a 1  kpc - high warp corresponds to a systematic effect of @xmath13  @xmath14as  yr@xmath4 in latitude and @xmath15  @xmath14as  yr@xmath4 in longitude .",
    "for such a signal to be detected the reference frame must be rigid to better than a few microarcsec on scales of @xmath16 ( i.e.  matching the high - frequency warp structure ) and on scales of @xmath17  radians , requirements well within the gaia capabilities .",
    "the corresponding distance requirements are more demanding : at the warp a mean parallax is less than 100  @xmath14as , so that resolution of the warp within 10  per cent implies distance accuracies of 10  @xmath14as at @xmath18  mag . along lines of sight with typical reddening",
    ", the study of the galactic warp will be within the limits of gaia s performance .",
    "[ [ dark - matter - in - the - disk ] ] dark matter in the disk + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the distribution of mass in the galactic disk is characterized by two numbers , its local volume density @xmath19 and its total surface density @xmath20 .",
    "they are fundamental parameters for many aspects of galactic structure , such as chemical evolution ( is there a significant population of white dwarf remnants from early episodes of massive star formation ? ) , the physics of star formation ( how many brown dwarfs are there ? ) , disk galaxy stability ( how important dynamically is the self - gravity of the disk ? ) , the properties of dark matter ( does the galaxy contain dissipational dark matter , which may be fundamentally different in nature from the dark matter assumed to provide flat rotation curves , and what is the local dark matter density and velocity distribution expected in astroparticle physics experiments ? ) , and non - newtonian gravity theories ( where does a description of galaxies with non - newtonian gravity and no dark matter fail ? ) .    the most widely referenced and commonly determined measure of the distribution of mass in the galactic disk near the sun is the local volume mass density @xmath19 , i.e.  the amount of mass per unit volume near the sun , which for practical purposes is the same as the volume mass density at the galactic plane .",
    "this quantity has units of @xmath21  pc@xmath22 , and its local value is often called the ` oort limit ' .",
    "the contribution of identified material to the oort limit may be determined by summing all local observed matter  an observationally difficult task .",
    "the uncertainties arise in part due to difficulties in detecting very low luminosity stars , even very near the sun , in part from uncertainties in the binary fraction among low mass stars , and in part from uncertainties in the stellar mass  luminosity relation .",
    "all these quantities will be determined directly , to extremely high precision , by gaia .",
    "the second measure of the distribution of mass in the solar vicinity is the integral surface mass density .",
    "this quantity has units of @xmath21  pc@xmath23 , and is the total amount of disk mass in a column perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "it is this quantity which is required for the deconvolution of rotation curves into ` disk ' and ` halo ' contributions to the large - scale distribution of mass in galaxies .",
    "if one knew both the local @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one could immediately constrain the scale height of any contribution to the local volume mass density which was not identified .",
    "that is , one could measure directly the velocity dispersion , i.e. , the temperature , of the ` cold ' dark matter .",
    "gaia will provide distances of delightful accuracy for all types of stars of all stellar populations , even the brightest , or those in the most rapid evolutionary phases which are very sparsely represented in the solar neighbourhood . with the parallel determination of extinction / reddening and metallicities by the use of multi - band photometry and spectroscopy",
    ", this huge amount of basic data will provide an extended basis for reading _ in situ _ stellar and galactic evolution .",
    "all parts of the hertzsprung  russell diagram will be comprehensively calibrated , including all phases of stellar evolution , from pre - main sequence stars to white dwarfs and all existing transient phases ; all possible masses , from brown dwarfs to the most massive o  stars ; all types of variable stars ; all possible types of binary systems down to brown dwarf and planetary systems ; all standard distance indicators ( pulsating stars , cluster sequences , supergiants , central stars of planetary nebulae , etc . ) .",
    "this extensive amount of data of extreme accuracy will stimulate a revolution in the exploration of stellar and galactic formation and evolution , and the determination of the cosmic distance scale .",
    "the agreement between predicted and observed properties of stars has remained qualitative due to the modest accuracy and relative scarcity of the relevant observed quantities .",
    "luminosity measurements are based exclusively on determinations of stellar distances and interstellar absorption .",
    "absorption can be deduced from multi - colour photometry , obtainable with gaia .",
    "the distances can be determined directly only by measurement of the trigonometric parallax .",
    "gaia will provide distances to an unprecedented 0.1  per  cent for @xmath24 stars out to a few hundred pc , and to 1  per  cent accuracy for a staggering @xmath25 stars up to a few kpc .",
    "distances to 10  per  cent will reach beyond 10  kpc , and will cover a significant fraction of our galaxy , including the galactic centre , spiral arms , the halo , and the bulge , and  for the brightest stars  to the nearest satellites .",
    "the faint limiting magnitude allows investigation of white dwarfs as well as the bottom of the main sequence down to brown dwarfs . for the first time",
    ", this will provide an extensive network of accurate distance measurements for all stellar types .    the ability to determine simultaneously and systematically",
    "the planetary frequency and distribution of orbital parameters for the stellar mix in the solar neighbourhood is a fundamental contribution that gaia will uniquely provide .",
    "the only limitations are those intrinsic to the mission , i.e. , the actual sensitivity of the gaia measurements to planetary perturbations .",
    "gaia s strength will be its discovery potential , following from the combined photometric and astrometric monitoring of all of the several hundred thousand bright stars out to distances of @xmath26  pc .",
    "essentially all jupiter - mass planets within 50  pc and with periods between 1.59  years will be discovered by gaia .      solar system objects present a challenge to gaia because of their significant proper motions , but they promise a rich scientific reward .",
    "the minor bodies provide a record of the conditions in the proto - solar nebula , and their properties therefore shed light on the formation of planetary systems .",
    "discovery and orbital determination of near - earth objects is a subject of high public interest .",
    "in addition to known asteroids , gaia will discover a very large number , of the order of @xmath27 or @xmath1 ( depending on the uncertainties on the extrapolations of the known population ) new objects .",
    "it should be possible to derive precise orbits for all the newly discovered objects , since each of them will be necessarily observed many times during the mission lifetime .",
    "these will include a large number of near - earth objects .",
    "gaia is ideal to look for these objects because of the enormous area of sky that must be searched .",
    "gaia will detect a significant number of kuiper belt objects during its 5-year mission .",
    "the angular motion of a typical object at @xmath28 elongation ( where gaia will be looking ) is small : the known kbos have @xmath29  arcsec  hr@xmath4 and @xmath30  arcsec  hr@xmath4 .",
    "the surface density of the kuiper belt at @xmath0  mag is @xmath31 objects per square degree ( @xmath32 at @xmath33  mag , implying that gaia should discover some number up to @xmath34  kbos with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 kbos with @xmath37 ) .",
    "scientific objectives regarding the kuiper belt that can be answered only with gaia include binarism , new plutinos , and the good orbits essential to understand the system dynamics .",
    "gaia will not only provide a representative census of the stars throughout the milky way , but it will also make unique contributions to extragalactic astronomy .",
    "these include the structure , dynamics and stellar populations in the magellanic clouds and other galactic satellites , and in m31 and m33 , with scientific consequences comparable to those noted above for the milky way .",
    "in addition , the faint magnitude limit and all - sky survey of gaia allows unique cosmological studies , from the space motions of local group galaxies , and studies of huge numbers of supernovae , galactic nuclei , and quasars .",

    "such orbital information provides direct constraints on the initial spectrum of perturbations in the early universe , on the global cosmological density parameter @xmath11 , and on the relative distributions of mass and light on length scales up to 1  mpc .",
    "radial velocities are known .",
    "the required measurements are distances and transverse velocities for the relatively isolated members of the local group , those more distant than @xmath38100  kpc from another large galaxy .",

    "a space astrometry forum ( chair : francois mignard , nice ) brings together the various space astrometry missions for issues such as reference frames . general oversight of the gaia studies is provided by the gaia consultative committee ( chair : gerry gilmore ) .",
    "there are many scientific tasks to optimise gaia which demand immediate effort .",
    "gaia will be defined and designed beyond major change in 3 years time .",
    "we have that much time to get it right .",
    "this challenge provides an ideal opportunity for interested scientists , and for phd projects , to play a major role in the project , and in the future of astronomy . among these tasks",
    "are definition of the gaia photometric system , development of data reduction algorithms and methods , modelling the sky as seen by gaia , developing systems for real - time access to gaia photometry , and so on .",
    "the gaia data will underpin astronomy for decades to come .",
    "the techniques needed to analyse 100 tb of multi - dimensional data are those of relevance for all future research .",
    "the science content of 100 tb of gaia data is vast .",
    "work has started .",
    "much needs to be done .",

    "gaia addresses science of vast general appeal , and will deliver huge scientific impact across the whole of astrophysics from studies of the solar system , and other planetary systems , through stellar astrophysics , to its primary goal , the origin and evolution of galaxies , out to the large scale structure of the universe , and fundamental physics .",
    "gaia is timely as it builds on recent intellectual and technological breakthroughs .",
    "current understanding and exploration of the early universe , through microwave background studies ( e.g. , planck ) and direct observations of high - redshift galaxies ( hst , ngst , vlt ) have been complemented by theoretical advances in understanding the growth of structure from the early universe up to galaxy formation .",
    "serious further advances require a detailed understanding of a ` typical ' galaxy , to test the physics and assumptions in the models . the milky way and the nearest local group galaxies uniquely provide such a template .",
    "while challenging , the entire gaia design is within the projected state - of - the - art , and the satellite can be developed in time for launch in 2010 .",
    "with such a schedule , a complete stereoscopic map of our galaxy will be available within 15  years .",
    "gaia will provide a quantitative , stereoscopic movie of the milky way , and so unlock its origins ."
