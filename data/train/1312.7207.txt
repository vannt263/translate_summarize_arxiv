    "the effective dimension - five weinberg operator  @xcite violates lepton number by two units and provides an explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses successfully if neutrinos are majorana fermions .",
    "three tree - level realizations of this operator correspond to three types of seesaw mechanism through exchange of singlet fermion  @xcite , triplet scalar  @xcite , and triplet fermion  @xcite respectively .",
    "these theories are often contemplated in the context of the grand unified theories which live in scales much higher than the electroweak theories , therefore , are beyond the reach of the present collider experiments . even though , the phenomenological studies aimed at the tev scale were investigated in the literature .",
    "in particular , the like - sign dilepton production at the hadron colliders for type - i and type - ii seesaw mechanisms were addressed in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively . on the other hand , leptons plus jets final states from fermion triplet",
    "decays in type - iii seesaw were also studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the discrimination of these underlying theories is possible by utilizing various multi - lepton signals  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , several model building methods provide opportunities to investigate the neutrino mass generation directly by lowering the scale to the reach of colliders .",
    "for example , one may introduce extra particles and/or discrete symmetries to generate neutrino masses radiatively  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the so - called `` inverse seesaw mechanism '' extends the conventional seesaw mass matrix with one additional vector - like singlet , @xmath1 , and it turns out the light neutrino masses receive double seesaw suppression factor @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dirac mass terms between @xmath6 , @xmath7 and new @xmath8 symmetry breaking scale associated to @xmath9 respectively )  @xcite . for a small @xmath5 and a tev scale @xmath4 , one would give the sub - ev neutrino masses without severely tuning yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "a general extension of the vector - like singlet @xmath10 to higher multiplets was also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another method to lower the seesaw scale is that the neutrino mass originates from higher dimension operators  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is a class of models called `` cascade seesaw mechanism ''  @xcite and a similar idea can be found in @xcite . in this case",
    "the neutrino masses are generated at tree level from a diagram as those of type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms by introducing both new scalar and fermion multiplets , carrying quantum numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 in this paper . ] . in this type of model ,",
    "the lepton number is violated by the mass insertion of the neutral component of the new fermion multiplet and the light neutrino masses are generated via a dimension-(@xmath14 ) operator .",
    "the higher dimensionality of neutrino mass operator is due to the development of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higher isospin scalar field @xmath15 ( scalar isospin @xmath16 is denoted in this way hereafter ) . in order to generate a naturally small vev for @xmath15",
    "one needs to engineer the scalar potential in a way similar to the type - ii seesaw mechanism . in the context of type - ii seesaw mechanism",
    "the sign of the scalar triplet quadratic term is positive and the lepton number breaking term ( trilinear term of scalar triplet and higgs doublet ) will trigger the vev development of scalar triplet . as a result , a seesaw structure between the vev and the mass of the triplet scalar can be obtained .",
    "the development of @xmath17 is realized by generating vevs of a series of isospin multiplets step by step so that the neutrino mass is suppressed by intermediated @xmath18 and @xmath19 with masses located within the reach of lhc .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the lhc collider signatures for such a general scenario of tree level seesaw mechanism with a heavy fermion exchange .",
    "we find one of the general features of the cascade seesaw mechanism is that both the type - ii and type - iii seesaw particles exist .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the generic idea of cascade seesaw mechanism in section - ii . in section - iii we briefly describe the minimal version of the cascade seesaw mechanism , and then we further investigate its collider phenomenology in detail in section - iv .",
    "then we draw the conclusion in section - v .",
    "the requirement of high scale canonical seesaw mechanism is because the neutrino dirac mass term @xmath3 is usually considered at the electroweak scale . naively , if one takes @xmath20 the seesaw scale is down to @xmath21  gev , which can be realized by generalizing the tree level seesaw diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ dig : numass ] .",
    "yukawa interactions involving the standard model ( sm ) left - handed lepton doublet @xmath22 are written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are yukawa couplings , @xmath25 is the charged conjugation , @xmath26 denotes the sm higgs doublet , @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to flavor indices @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the new fermion ( @xmath19 ) generation index .",
    "@xmath19 field is self - conjugated and can form a majorana mass term , @xmath31 , expanded as @xmath32 we choose a real and diagonal basis here without the loss of generality .",
    "the charged dirac fermions can be defined as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , ... , and the neutral majorana fermion is @xmath35 . in such a way",
    "the chiral anomaly is cancelled and the lepton number is violated by the majorana mass term of @xmath36 . the diagram can be divided into two parts , _",
    "i.e. _ dirac mass from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) and a heavy fermion intermediator .",
    "when @xmath37 is taken to be the sm higgs doublet , one can retain the type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms with iso - singlet and iso - triplet fermion as the intermediator respectively .",

    "[ dig : numass ] represent how @xmath15 develops its vev via the cascade chain effect involving multi - higgs external lines . on the other hand",
    ", the constraints from electroweak precision measurements put an upper limit on the scalar multiplet vev .",

    "denotes the deviation from 1 and constrains the @xmath42  gev .",
    "the key point to obtain a small vev of @xmath15 in the cascade seesaw mechanism is the relation between lepton number violation and the development of @xmath43 . to make it clear , there",

    "the vev of @xmath45 receives a suppression factor , @xmath49 which is similar to type - ii seesaw mechanism . to generalize this case to higher isospin ( @xmath50 )",
    "multiplets , one has to utilize the next - to - higher isospin ( @xmath51 ) field as a bridge to develop the vev .",
    "for example , the quartic term @xmath52 will induce @xmath53 after @xmath26 and @xmath45 develop vevs .",
    "the procedure can be applied to a sequence of scalar fields @xmath54 , @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that another reason for the positivity of @xmath56 terms is to prevent the tachyonic fields for higher isospin multiplets .",
    "the general vev of @xmath15 can be derived as @xmath57 here the factor @xmath58 is corresponding to @xmath59 higgs external lines illustrated in fig .  [",
    "dig : numass ] . it can be read that the vev of @xmath15 is suppressed by integrating out the intermediate scalar multiplets via the cascade chain .",
    "therefore , the general seesaw formula for the neutrino masses can be expressed as  @xcite , @xmath60",
    "it is obvious that the minimal scenario in this class of models appears when @xmath46   @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sm model particles , we have two extra fields , a scalar quadruplet and a fermion quintuplet , @xmath61 as we can see the scalar triplet in type - ii seesaw and the fermion triplet in type - iii seesaw mechanisms are embedded in the particle content .",
    "thus the general features of cascade seesaw mechanism are the coexistence of type - ii and type - iii seesaw mechanisms .",
    "the scalar potential is given by @xmath62 and it leads the vev of @xmath45 to be @xmath63 . the tree level contribution to the neutrino mass is obtained , @xmath64 with @xmath30 stands for the number of the fermion quintuplet . for @xmath65 gev , @xmath66 , @xmath67  gev and @xmath68 ev , we have yukawa couplings around @xmath69 .",
    "the relatively large yukawa couplings would significantly enhance the search probability at the lhc .",
    "the model would also give flavor changing interactions due to the mismatch between the gauge eigenstates and mass eigenstates of neutrinos .",
    "the two eigenstates can be related by an unitary matrix , @xmath70 here we assume @xmath71 . the gauge neutral current can be written as @xmath72z_{\\mu } + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the gauge charged current as @xmath73w^-_{\\mu } + { \\rm h.c.}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] just like the canonical seesaw mechanism , in the minimal realizations the mixing between the light and heavy neutrinos is predicted as @xmath74 thus is suppressed .",
    "this makes some processes with mixing parameters involved difficult to produce at the lhc .",
    "however , it is known that a significant mixing between light - heavy neutrinos can be obtained as large as @xmath75 which is around the experimental upper limit .",
    "hence the mixings decouple from the mass ratio , if @xmath76 is of rank 1 or tr@xmath77 for three generations of @xmath19 field  @xcite . in the following section we will study the processes which are insensitive to the mixings .",
    "both type - ii and type - iii seesaw particles exist in the minimal cascade seesaw model .",
    "the doubly charged scalar in type - ii seesaw model and the exotic heavy fermion in type - iii seesaw model have been searched at lep  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the up - to - date lower limits for the mass of the doubly charged scalar are obtained to be @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 gev if the @xmath81 branching ratio of the doubly charged scalar decays into @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 is assumed respectively  @xcite .",
    "however , we shall emphasize here that the above constraints do not apply to the doubly charged scalar in cascade seesaw models in which the tree level @xmath85 coupling to dilepton is absent .",
    "the branching ratios of like - sign dilepton channels are always negligible , which is independent of the multi - scalar vev .",
    "the decay channels of @xmath85 are @xmath86 and @xmath87 if kinematically allowed .",
    "we plot the decay widths and the branching ratios of these two decay channels in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalardecay ] by taking @xmath88  gev as the benchmark point  @xcite .",
    "we find the diboson channel is dominant in the case of yukawa coupling @xmath89 and scalar vev @xmath90  gev .",
    "a recent study sets the limits of doubly charged scalar mass to be below @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev by using the data at lep and at the lhc with @xmath93 tev collision energy and the @xmath94 @xmath95 integrated luminosity .",
    "a lower limit is evaluated to be @xmath96 gev if the extrapolation of the data to 20 @xmath97 is used  @xcite .",
    "these are the constraints we should adopt in our discussion .",
    "for the searches of the fermionic triplet lepton in type - iii seesaw model , the cms collaboration has reported the lower limits ranging from @xmath98 to @xmath99 gev in events selected with 3 isolated leptons ( the range depends on the selected lepton flavors ) at @xmath100 tev and an integrated luminosity of 4.9 @xmath95  @xcite . while the atlas collaboration excludes the heavy lepton mass below 245 gev in the event selection of at least 4 charged lepton in the final states at @xmath101 tev and 5.8 @xmath95 of luminosity with the mixing parameter at @xmath102 .",
    "interestingly , the probability to have equal to or more than the observed number of events with a background only hypothesis , @xmath103 , is found to be 0.20 at heavy fermion mass around 420 gev  @xcite .",

    "for the extra scalar multiplets , we discuss the processes with scalar decaying into diboson which is the dominant process for most of the parameter space .",
