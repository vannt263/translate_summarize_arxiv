    "it is frequently stated that we understand exoplanets only as well as we understand the host star .",
    "such a statement is particularly true for low - mass dwarf stars , whose atmospheres often diverge from blackbody models . there has been a concerted effort in recent years to obtain observational constraints on the stellar models for low - mass stars @xcite , especially for those monitored by the _",
    "mission @xcite .",
    "a further challenge includes the confusion that can be caused by the stellar rotation period of low - mass stars since that can often coincide with the range of orbital periods of planets that may exist in the habitable zone ( hz ) of those stars @xcite .",
    "even so , there have been several successful detections of terrestrial planets in or near the hz of low - mass stars , such as kepler-186  f @xcite , k2 - 3  d @xcite , and the recent discovery of proxima centauri b @xcite .",
    "the low - mass m - dwarf star , wolf-1061 ( also designated as gj  628 ) , is one of our closest neighbors , located approximately 4.3 pc away @xcite .",
    "the star was recently discovered to host three planets that lie within the super - earth mass regime , one of which may be located within the hz of the system @xcite .",
    "the orbits of the planets were significantly updated by @xcite using additional data from the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher ( harps ) spectrograph .",
    "the orbital solutions largely agree with respect to the inner two planets , but the @xcite solution finds an orbital period of the outer planet that is a factor of @xmath33 larger than that found by @xcite . both of the solutions do agree that planet c is near or in the hz of the host star , the location of which is highly dependent on the star parameters of luminosity and effective temperature . both solutions also predict reasonably high transit probabilities and depths such that follow - up photometry during calculated transit windows are encouraged .",
    "this paper presents a characterization of the wolf  1061 host star and the associated planets with new data and numerical simulations . in section  [ fund ] , the fundamental stellar parameters of the host star are updated through interferometry data that provide measurements of the stellar radius , effective temperature , and luminosity .",
    "section  [ phot ] presents seven years of precise , automated photometry that reveals the correct stellar rotation period , supports the existence of the three purported planets , and finds no evidence for planetary transits .",

    ", the stellar properties of wolf  1061 have remained uncertain largely due to the fact that it is a very dim m3v late - type dwarf .",
    "prior to our investigation , the values of wolf 1061 s temperature , luminosity , flux , and radius have varied in the literature .",
    "previous estimates for the red dwarf s temperature have been reported as being as low as 2877  k @xcite to as high as 3400  k @xcite with a variety of values reported between these two extremes @xcite .",

    "planet c spends 61% of its orbit duration within the hz , but that time remains constrained to the optimistic hz . in that respect ,",
    "planet c is quite similar to the case of kepler-69  c , which was proposed to be a strong super - venus candidate by @xcite .",
    "indeed , both of the inner two planets , terrestrial in nature according to the results of both @xcite and @xcite , lie within the venus zone of the host star @xcite and are thus possible runaway greenhouse candidates .",
    "another factor that plays a role in the habitability of the system is the orbital dynamics between the planets as a function of time . to investigate orbital stability and dynamics",
    ", we utilized the mercury integrator package @xcite , with the hybrid symplectic / bulirsch - stoer integrator and a jacobi coordinate system .",

    "the orbital architecture of the system was output in 100 year intervals .",
    "for the coplanar scenario where the system is viewed approximately edge - on ( inclination of @xmath79 and the true planetary masses are equivalent to the minimum masses ) , the system was found to be stable over the full @xmath77 year simulation duration . although stable , the compact nature of the system combined with the relatively large orbital eccentricities results in an active dynamical evolution of key keplerian orbital parameters .",
    "in particular , evidence of the angular momentum exchange between the planets can be observed in the oscillations of the eccentricity and argument of periastron .",
    "these evolutions of eccentricity and argument of periastron are shown for a simulation duration of @xmath80 years in figures [ ecc ] and [ omega ] respectively .",
    "+   +      +   +     the bottom panel of figure  [ ecc ] shows that the amplitude of the eccentricity variations for the outer planet is largely insensitive to the presence of the inner planets , and remains close to the initial value of @xmath81 .",
    "the interaction between the inner two planets is more pronounced , with mean eccentricities substantially below the initial values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , the precession of the periastron arguments evolves on a rapid timescale for the inner two planets compared with the outer planet ( see figure  [ omega ] ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the inner planet reduces to the circular case at regular intervals , whereas the eccentricity of planet c drops as low as @xmath30.03 .",
    "the eccentricity of a planet within the hz does not necessarily exclude the presence of liquid water on the surface , as the required conditions also depend upon such factors as atmospheric composition , scale height , and response to variations in incident flux @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a zero eccentricity for planet c results in the orbit being entirely interior to the optimistic hz .",
    "it is thus possible that planet c is more amenable to habitable conditions when near to peak eccentricity , since the planet moves slowly through the apastron passage in the hz .",
    "the assessment of host star properties is a critical component of exoplanetary studies , at least for the realm of indirect detections through which exoplanet discoveries thus far have predominantly occurred .",
    "this situation will remain true for the coming years during which the transit method will primarily be used from space missions such as the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) , the characterising exoplanet satellite ( cheops ) , and the planetary transits and oscillations of stars ( plato ) mission .",
    "of particular interest are the radius and effective temperature of the stars since the radius impacts the interpretation of observed transit events and the combination of radius and temperature is used to calculate the extent of the hz .    here",
    ", we have presented the results from direct measurements of stellar properties for one of the closest known exoplanet host stars ; wolf  1061 .",
    "our direct measurement of the stellar radius from interferometric observations gives @xmath0  @xmath1 , which is remarkably close to the value previous calculated by @xcite , which can be considered a significant triumph for the empirical calibrations used in that work .",
    "our sed fit resulted in determining a luminosity of @xmath84  @xmath26 for wolf  1061 and , after combination with the measured angular diameter , an effective temperature of @xmath27  k.    we further provide seven years of wolf  1061 photometry based on obsservations acquired with tsu s t11 apt .",
    "these data were sufficient to investigate periodic signals that are a measurement of the stellar rotation period .",
    "our analysis was able to disentangle the various aliases and isolate a rotation period of @xmath2  days .",
    "our photometric precision and observing cadence are able to rule out transits of the two inner planets in the system but the possibility of a transiting outer planet remains open .",
    "finally , our measured stellar parameters were used to derive the hz boundaries of the system and investigate the location and dynamics of the planetary orbits with respect to the hz .",
    "we find that , although the eccentric solution for planet c allows it to enter the optimistic hz , the two inner planets are consistent with possible super - venus planets @xcite .",
    "long - term stability analysis shows that the system is stable in the current configuration , and that the eccentricity of the two inner planets frequently reduce to zero , at which times the orbit of planet c is entirely interior to the optimistic hz .",
    "we thus conclude that the system is unlikely to host planets with surface liquid water .",

    "<S> our simulations of the planetary orbital dynamics shows that the eccentricity of the habitable zone planet oscillates to values as high as @xmath30.15 as it exchanges angular momentum with the other planets in the system . </S>"
