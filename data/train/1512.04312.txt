    "this can be formulated as a classical elimination theory question which , at least in theory , can be computed using grbner basis methods . moreover ,",
    "the defining equations do not yield decompositions , only existential information . rather than focusing on computing defining equations",
    ", this paper uses numerical algebraic geometry ( e.g , see @xcite for a general overview ) for performing membership tests and computing decompositions .",
    "in particular , we use _ numerical elimination theory _ to perform the computations based on the methods developed in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "this approach differs from several previous methods of combining numerical algebraic geometry and elimination theory , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , in that these previous methods relied upon interpolation .",
    "the general setup for this paper is as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be an irreducible and nondegenerate projective variety defined over @xmath1 and @xmath3 be the affine cone of @xmath4 .",
    "we let a point @xmath5 be a nonzero vector in @xmath6 while @xmath7 $ ] denotes the line in @xmath6 passing through the origin and @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath7\\in { { \\mathbb p}}^n$ ] is the projectivization of @xmath8 .",

    "obviously , @xmath24 .",
    "secant varieties are just special cases of join varieties . for irreducible and nondegenerate projective varieties @xmath25 ,",
    "the constructible join and join variety of @xmath26 , respectively , are @xmath27\\in x_1 , \\ldots , [ x_k]\\in x_k}\\langle [ x_1 ] , \\ldots , [ x_k ] \\rangle \\hbox{~~and~~ } j(x_1 , \\ldots , x_k)= \\overline{j^0(x_1,\\ldots , x_k)}.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as mentioned above , one can test , in principle , if an element belongs to a certain join variety ( or if it has certain @xmath4-border rank ) by computing defining equations for the join variety ( or the secant variety , respectively ) . unfortunately , finding defining equations for secant and join varieties is generally a very difficult elimination problem which is far from being well understood at this time .",
    "the following summarizes the remaining sections of this paper .",
    "the knowledge of whether an element lies in a constructible join ( or if it has a certain @xmath4-rank ) is an open condition .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 is almost always an open subset of @xmath31 , so membership tests for @xmath30 based on evaluating polynomials to determine the @xmath4-rank of a given element do not exist in general .",
    "currently , there are few theoretical algorithms for specific cases , e.g. , @xcite . in section  [ sec : membership ] , we present a numerical algebraic geometric approach to join varieties .",
    "once an element is known to be in @xmath32 or @xmath31 , numerical elimination theory can also be used to decide if the element is in the corresponding constructible set @xmath33 or @xmath30 . rather than test a particular element ,",
    "section  [ sec : boundary ] considers the approach first presented in @xcite for computing the codimension one components of the boundaries of @xmath33 or @xmath30 , namely the codimension one components of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "for example , this allows one to compute the codimension one component of the closure of the set of points of @xmath4-border rank at most @xmath12 whose rank is strictly larger than @xmath12 .",
    "another problem considered in this paper from the numerical point of view regards computing real decompositions of a real element .",
    "for example , after computing the @xmath4-rank @xmath12 of a real element @xmath36 , we would like to know if it has a decomposition using @xmath12 real elements , that is , determine if the real @xmath4-rank of @xmath5 is the same as its complex @xmath4-rank .",
    "computing the real @xmath4-rank has recently been studied by various authors , especially in regards to the typical ranks of symmetric tensors , i.e. , @xmath12 such that the symmetric tensors whose real rank is @xmath12 is an open real set .",
    "theoretic results in this direction are provided in @xcite . in section  [ sec : realrank ] , we describe a method using @xcite to determine the existence of real decompositions .",
    "we emphasize that a numerical algebraic geometric approach works well for decomposing generic elements .",
    "for example , a numerical algebraic geometric based approach was presented in @xcite for computing the total number of decompositions of a general element in the so - called perfect cases , i.e. , when the general element has finitely many decompositions . in every case",
    ", one can track a single solution path defined by a newton homotopy to compute a decomposition of a general element , as shown in section  [ sec : largerank ] .",
    "local numerical techniques exist for computing ( numerically approximating ) decompositions of elements , e.g. , see  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : largerank ] also develops an approach for combining such local numerical techniques with newton homotopies for deriving upper bounds on border rank over both the real and complex numbers .",
    "the last section , section  [ sec : examples ] , considers a variety of examples .",
    "let @xmath37 be irreducible and nondegenerate projective varieties . consider the constructible join @xmath33 and join variety @xmath32 defined in .",

    "since @xmath43 naturally depends on affine cones , we will simplify the numerical algebraic geometric presentation by just considering affine varieties . as (",
    "* remark  8) states , we can naturally extend from affine varieties to projective spaces by considering coordinates as sections of the hyperplane section bundle and accounting for the fact that coordinatewise projections have a _ center _",
    ", i.e. , a set of indeterminacy , that is contained in each fiber .",
    "another option is to restrict to a general affine coordinate patch and introduce scalars as illustrated in section  [ ssec : basicmembershipex ] . due to this implementation choice",
    ", there is the potential for ambiguity in section  [ ssec : basicmembership ] , e.g. , the dimension of the affine cone over a projective variety is one more than the dimension of the projective variety . in that section ,",
    "the meaning of dimension is dependent on the implementation choice .    after defining witness sets",
    ", we explore a membership test for the join variety @xmath32 in section  [ ssec : basicmembership ] .",
    "this test uses homotopy continuation without the need for computing defining equations , e.g. , via interpolation or classical elimination , for @xmath32 .",
