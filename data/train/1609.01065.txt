    "the fact that the local potential distribution @xmath10 is not gaussian and strongly asymmetric  in contrast with model potentials often used in theoretical calculations  has important consequences for the behaviour of the mobility edge  @xcite .",
    "since the kinetic energy is positive , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pv ] ) that no energy level exists below @xmath11 , implying that the mobility edge @xmath12 must satisfy the condition @xmath13 .",
    "optical speckle potentials also exhibit non - local spatial correlations .",
    "in particular , the two - point correlation function @xmath14 is characterized by finite correlation lengths which , as shown below , play a crucial role for the mobility edge . in the simplest model of a three - dimensional isotropic speckle potential ( created by a monochromatic laser of wavevector",

    "it was shown that the mobility edge lies _ way below _ the average potential , @xmath18 , a non - trivial behavior confirmed by various approximate theoretical approaches based on the self - consistent theory of localization@xcite .",
    "however , all measurements reported in ref .   and a subset of those appearing in ref .   have positive mobility edges .    in the simple case of isotropic correlations in the potential , the asymptotic behavior of the mobility edge can be deduced by considering the different energy scales of the system .",
    "there is a natural energy scale associated with the correlation length @xmath19 , called the correlation energy@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the atomic mass . for @xmath22",
    "the de broglie wavelength of an atom with energy @xmath5 is much larger than the correlation length of the potential , so that the particle can tunnel through the disorder barriers .",
    "this is the so - called `` quantum '' regime , where the mobility edge is expected to be very close to zero .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath23 the matter wave resolves all the fine details of the disordered potential . in this `` classical '' regime",

    "in order to understand how the position of the mobility edge is affected by the anisotropy of realistic optical disorder , we have performed quasi - exact numerical calculations for two different speckle geometries and different values of the numerical aperture . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspme ] we plot the normalized mobility edge @xmath41 for the _ single _ laser speckle configuration as a function of the disorder amplitude @xmath5 , expressed in units of @xmath42 , for five different values of the numerical aperture @xmath28 controlling the anisotropy . in fig .  [",
    "fig : cspme ] , the same quantity is plotted for a disordered potential generated by _ two _ crossed identical laser speckles , for two different values of @xmath28 .",
    "the first striking observation is that the mobility edge is always negative ( i.e.  below the average potential @xmath5 ) for all anisotropic configurations , as for the isotropic speckle whose results are also plotted in the figures .",
    "the second striking observation is that , although the mobility edge values are widely different for different degrees of anisotropy , the behavior in each case is strongly similar .",
    "this suggests that the scaling law , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling_law ] ) , can be extended to the anisotropic case by an appropriate redefinition of the correlation energy .",
    "we thus _ define _ the correlation energy in the anisotropic case by ( see supplementary information ) : @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath40 being the correlation lengths of the disorder along the major axes .",
    "there is however still some ambiguity on how to define the correlation length in a given direction .",
    "depending on the detailed shape of the correlation function , different definitions may lead to different numerical values ( up to a constant numerical factor depending on the shape ) .",
    "we use a pragmatic definition , namely that @xmath19 is the half - width at half - maximum of the central correlation peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : speckle]b ) divided by the numerical factor @xmath45 such that @xmath46 this adhoc definition ensures the compatibility with the usual definitions of the correlation length and correlation energy in the isotropic case .    in the inset of figs .",
    "[ fig : sspme ] and [ fig : cspme ] , we replot the same numerical values of the mobility edge as function of rescaled disorder strength @xmath47 for the various anisotropic configurations , each configuration having a specific @xmath48 horizontal rescaling factor as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_energy_anisotropic ] ) .",
    "amazingly , all curves collapse on a _ single universal _ curve , independently of the anisotropy and whether the speckle pattern is created by a single laser beam or two crossed beams .",
    "this constitutes a major result of this paper , as it allows to take into account all complications introduced by the inherent anisotropy of experimental speckle disorder through a simple rescaling of the correlation energy .",
    "strictly speaking , this universality can not be exact , as details of the disorder correlation function must have an influence on the position of the mobility edge . however , this influence is actually rather moderate@xcite .",
    "indeed , the system being strongly scattering at the mobility edge ( according to the ioffe - regel criterion , the mean free - path is shorter than the de broglie wavelength ) , long - range correlations in the potential are essentially irrelevant .",
    "this universality is more accurate in the quantum regime @xmath49 where the matter wave averages out the disordered potential . in the regime of current cold - atom experiments ,",
    "the universal function @xmath50 allows to predict the position of the mobility edge within _ a few percent _ , which is largely enough considering that the discrepancy between experimental results and theoretical predictions is of the order of 100% or higher .",
    "recently , the position of the mobility edge in the single speckle configuration has been estimated in ref .  , using a different method based on the statistical properties of the energy spectrum .",
    "we have added the corresponding points in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : sspme ] .",
    "although they lie slightly above our results , these data confirm that the mobility edge is very significantly below the average potential , even in the anisotropic case .     of atoms in the single - speckle configuration , plotted as a function of the disorder amplitude @xmath5 in units of @xmath42 ( @xmath15 being the wavevector of the laser beam and",

    "the inset shows the same data for the normalized mobility edge @xmath41 but versus normalized disorder amplitude @xmath54 , with average correlation energy @xmath62 , which collapse to a single universal curve . ]",
    "to date , three different cold - atom experiments have reported measurements of the mobility edge in blue - detuned speckle disorder  @xcite , by monitoring the temporal expansion of a localized matter wavepacket in the presence of disorder . although all three experiments do not use the same setup for the generation of the optical disorder potential and hence have different potential correlation functions , they can be quantitatively compared in the quantum regime using the above universal scaling of the mobility edge .",
    "the experiment of ref .   used a very anisotropic single speckle configuration . the use of spin - polarised fermionic atoms allowed to have a relatively well defined energy of the atoms , which could be an important advantage for pinpointing the precise location of the mobility edge .",
    "however , the duration of the experiment may have been too short to detect slow diffusion above the mobility edge@xcite , thus leading to a possible overestimation of the lowest diffusive energy . as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : expme ] , their inferred mobility edge is indeed much higher than other experimental and numerical estimates .",
    "moreover , it is always above the average potential , in contradiction with all numerical and theoretical predictions .",
    "we thus conclude that these results are impaired by some severe imperfections .",
    "the experiment of ref .   used two crossed speckles to achieve a more isotropic configuration , but suffered from a broad initial energy distribution of the atoms  extending on both sides of the mobility edge  making a direct measurement of the mobility edge rather difficult .",
    "an indirect estimate was given assuming that the mobility edge @xmath12 scales quadratically with the disorder amplitude , @xmath63 a `` naive '' implementation of the self - consistent theory of localization  @xcite combined with the estimated energy distribution of the atoms gave a prediction for the localized fraction vs. disorder strength which was not in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "however , a fair agreement was observed by correcting the prediction of the self - consistent approach by a `` heuristic shift '' quadratic in @xmath64 this yields the straight red line @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expme ] , in decent agreement with our numerical predictions and notably below the average potential .",
    "unfortunately , these measurements were limited to a disorder strength much smaller than the correlation energy @xmath66 .",
    "the more recent experiment of ref .   used a similar two - speckles configuration , with a resulting large localized fraction of atoms thanks to a better control of atom - atom interactions via a feshbach resonance .",
    "when the disorder amplitude is rescaled by the appropriate @xmath67 , the qualitative behavior of the mobility edge with @xmath5 is similar to our numerical results , but quantitatively too high .",
    "the origin of this deviation is not entirely clear to us at this moment .",
    "we note , however , that the energy distribution of atoms has not been directly measured in the experiment , but rather inferred from numerical simulations of fairly small systems .",
    "an error in this non - trivial reconstruction process could have biased their estimation of the mobility edge . moreover , in these crossed - speckle configurations  as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : speckle].b  small numerical apertures result in multiple correlation peaks in the direction of fringes ( @xmath34 direction in the aforementioned figure ) ; this could lead to an effective correlation energy smaller than the one we define in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_energy_anisotropic ] ) , hence pushing the mobility edge below the `` universal '' curve .     has been computed using the correlation lengths provided in each article . the universal curve for the mobility edge is also represented for reference ( black dashed line ) .",
    "we computed numerically the mobility edge for non - interacting cold atoms in three - dimensional speckle potentials , taking into account the long - range anisotropic disorder correlations that characterize realistic experimental configurations . in the quantum regime of low disorder , which is relevant for most experiments",
    ", it was shown that the mobility edge displays a robust scaling property when the anisotropy and/or speckle geometry is varied , with the correlation energy of the potential ",
    "defined from the geometric mean of the correlation lengths  as the scaling parameter .",
    "early experimental studies of 3d anderson localization@xcite as well as more accurate measurements@xcite show significant discrepancies from this universal behavior , calling for further studies .",
    "this work opens the way for more quantitative comparisons between current cold - atom experiments on 3d anderson localization and theory / numerics .",
    "* definition of the correlation energy for anisotropic speckles . * for isotropic disorder , the characteristic energy scale separating the low - energy `` quantum '' regime from the high - energy `` classical '' regime is the correlation energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_energy_isotropic ] ) . for anisotropic disorder , it is customary  @xcite to define the correlation energy using the geometrical average of the correlation lengths along the three directions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_energy_anisotropic ] ) .",
    "our numerical results confirm that this is indeed the energy scale relevant for the mobility edge , and we give below two complementary arguments justifying this assumption .",
    "first , at very low disorder strength , the mobility edge is also at very low energy , in fact only slightly below the average potential .",
    "then , the typical de broglie wavelength @xmath68 of the atom is larger than the correlation lengths of the potential , so that the particle averages out all short - range fluctuations of the potential landscape .",
    "the typical size of a potential spot is the product @xmath69 the quantum wave will thus average about @xmath70 uncorrelated potential spots . from the central limit theorem , it will result in an effective renormalized potential with gaussian fluctuations of typical strength @xmath71 and _ isotropic _ correlation length @xmath72 at this stage , the details of the correlation function of the initial potential are irrelevant , leaving only the geometric average @xmath73 as a relevant parameter .",
    "calculations performed for specific models@xcite confirm that the dynamics at very low energy tends to be isotropic .",
    "a second justification comes from the calculation of the weak localization correction to classical diffusive transport .",
    "the starting point is the modification of the classical boltzmann diffusion picture by quantum interference due to closed loops . in the anisotropic case , where one must use a diffusion tensor ,",
    "the correction to the boltzmann tensor @xmath74 is  @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the average density of states per unit volume .",
    "the integral has a large @xmath77 divergence which can be regularized with a convenient cut - off .",
    "the simplest choice for this momentum cut - off is to choose along each direction @xmath78 the inverse of the transport mean free path @xmath79 . as discussed in refs .  , the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor essentially reflects the anisotropy of the transport mean free path , so that the transport mean free time @xmath80 is essentially identical along all directions .",
    "the diagonal element of the diffusion tensor along direction @xmath81 is then @xmath82 with this choice of cut - off , the integral can be simply performed , and the correction scales like@xcite @xmath83^{-1/2}.$ ] in turn , this implies that , instead of the usual isotropic ioffe - regel criterion @xmath84 for the determination of the mobility edge , we have @xmath85^{1/3}\\approx 1.$ ] as , in any case , the transport mean free path in a given direction is always larger than the correlation length of the disorder in the same direction , we end up again with the conclusion that the relevant length scale is @xmath86    note however that the weak localization correction is here predicted to have no effect on the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor@xcite , but only leads to a global renormalization .",
    "more sophisticated approaches  @xcite as well as numerical results  @xcite show that it is not the case .",
    "close to the mobility edge , transport is less anisotropic than in the classical boltzmann regime .",
    "a quantitative understanding of this phenomenon is highly desirable , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "preliminary results indicate that some anisotropy remains at the mobility edge . in any case",
    ", it does not seem to invalidate that the anisotropic correlation energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_energy_anisotropic ] ) is the relevant energy scale of the problem .",
    "* numerical generation of the disordered potential .",
    "* in order to reproduce the correct disorder correlation functions",
    " i.e. the ones used in real experiments  we generate numerically a `` random '' electromagnetic field by combining many plane waves with different wavevectors and uncorrelated random phases . because a monochromatic laser is used to create the speckle , the wavevectors ( of unit modulus ) are distributed on the surface of a sphere , typically with a gaussian distribution like in most experiments , inside a single cap with half - angle @xmath28 ( in the `` single speckle '' configuration ) or two perpendicular caps ( in the `` crossed speckles '' configuration ) .",
    "all wavevectors are taken with the same polarization .",
    "the disorder at a given position is then simply the modulus square of the electric field computed by coherently combining the various plane waves .",

    "we then proceed in the standard way @xcite by computing recursively the total transmission of a bar - shaped sample of width @xmath90 and length @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 at fixed energy @xmath93 and disorder amplitude @xmath5 . as quasi-1d systems",

    "<S> recent experiments on non - interacting ultra - cold atoms in correlated disorder have yielded conflicting results regarding the so - called mobility edge , i.e. the energy threshold separating anderson localized from diffusive states . at the same time , there are theoretical indications that the experimental data overestimate the position of this critical energy , sometimes by a large amount . the non - trivial effect of anisotropy in the spatial correlations of experimental speckle potentials have been put forward as a possible cause for such discrepancy . using extensive numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effect of anisotropy alone is not sufficient to explain the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that , for not - too - strong anisotropy , realistic disorder configurations are essentially identical to the isotropic case , modulo a simple rescaling of the energies .    </S>",
    "<S> when a wave travels in a random medium , the interference between multiple scattering paths caused by the disorder barriers can completely stop its diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , known as anderson localization  @xcite , is completely general and applies to any kind of waves including light waves in diffusive media  @xcite or in photonic crystals  @xcite , ultrasound  @xcite , microwaves  @xcite and atomic matter waves  @xcite , the latter describing the behavior of non - interacting atoms in the low temperature quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> localization experiments using cold atomic gases have several advantages over their solid - state counterparts@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inhibition of transport may be directly measured by probing the atomic wavefunction using the time - of - flight technique . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of interactions , that unavoidably hinders localization measurements in solid - state systems , can here be reduced by going from a bose - einstein condensate to a dilute gas or by using feshbach resonances . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , thanks to light - matter interaction , far - detuned laser speckles can be used as tunable disordered potentials for the atoms , allowing the exploration of the localization phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> several experiments@xcite on cold atomic gases have attempted to characterize metal - insulator anderson transitions in three dimensions , starting from a precise measurement of the mobility edge . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be surprisingly difficult , both theoretically and experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> since the anderson transition is a second - order quantum phase transition@xcite , the localization length diverges on the localized side and the diffusion coefficient slowly vanishes on the diffusive side . </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing the two behaviors requires long observation times , which is not easily achievable in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , an atomic wavepacket expanding in a random potential inevitably contains states at different energies , thus mixing localized and extended components . for these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> results on the position of the mobility edge are widely spread . on the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty comes from the fact that the metal - insulator transition takes place in the strongly scattering regime where perturbative / diagrammatic expansions in the disorder strength fail and one has to resort to the indignity of numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the first quasi - exact numerical estimations  @xcite of the mobility edge turned out to lie significantly below most experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that the peculiar anisotropic correlation functions of realistic disordered potentials , which were not taken into account in ref . , could be at the origin of this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> however , reproducing all minute details of experimental speckle configurations in numerical simulations is cumbersome , if desirable at all . </S>",
    "<S> it would be more profitable to gain physical understanding of how the mobility edge changes with speckle geometry , and know its more universal features . in the present paper , we show that the effect of anisotropy on the mobility edge can be taken into account very simply  to a surprizingly good accuracy  by a proper rescaling of the characteristic energies . </S>",
    "<S> as most reported experimental measurements of the mobility edge do not seem to follow such scaling property , we conclude that they are actually problematic . </S>"
