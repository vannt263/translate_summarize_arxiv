    "we limit ourselves to the diagonal component . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we can notice the rise of the drude term with increasing the magnetic field , while in fig .",
    "3(b ) the small - polaron absorption band is suppressed .",
    "this behavior is more pronounced at higher temperatures ( see fig . 4 for @xmath154 ) .",
    "at @xmath13 the introduction of the magnetic field is able to fill up the low frequency optical gap present in the high - temperature phase ( fig . 5 ) .",

    "we obtain two different behaviors : metallic ( @xmath158 ) and insulating ( @xmath159 ) emphasizing in logarithmic scale the behavior of activated resistivity characteristic of a @xmath86 phase for @xmath160 . @xcite the magnetic field shifts the peak of the resistivity at higher temperatures .",
    "since the @xmath87 regime is characterized by a rapid increase of the resistivity , @xcite at @xmath13 a large difference between resistivities at different magnetic fields occurs .",
    "the magnetoresistance ratio ( see in fig .",
    "7(a ) @xmath161 in percent ) @xmath162 } { \\rho(h ) } \\label{135ar1}\\ ] ] assumes large values at the transition temperature , so that the effect of the magnetic field is dramatically amplified near @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the @xmath6 effect and , in general , the high sensitivity of the system to external parameters are due to the subtle balance between @xmath112 and @xmath113 phases characterized by different lattice , spin and charge properties .    we have calculated the effect of the applied magnetic field on the @xmath18 factor . in fig .",
    "7(b ) we report @xmath163 , the relative variation of the @xmath18 factors obtained without and with the external field , in order to make a comparison with the magnetoresistance ratio .",
    "@xcite the quantity @xmath163 shows a well defined peak around the transition temperature , indicating that the application of the magnetic field reduces the polaronic distortions .",
    "the two quantities , @xmath161 and @xmath164 in fig .",
    "7 , are both peaked around @xmath13 showing the existence of a strong correlation between lattice distortions , conductivity and magnetic properties .",
    "in this section we deal with the isotope effect in the @xmath6 regime at @xmath2 . in particular we calculate the effects of isotope substitution on the infrared spectra .",
    "the isotopic substitution of the oxygen from @xmath21 to @xmath22 changes the values of @xmath148 and @xmath38 to @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively , where @xmath167 is the mass of @xmath22 .",

    "we have evaluated the oxygen - isotope exponent @xmath171 , making a comparison with experimental values .",
    "@xcite we find the decreasing behavior of @xmath172 with increasing the hole doping @xmath173 ( fig . 9 ) .    near @xmath13 we have calculated the optical conductivity for the two isotopes ( fig.10 ) . while the @xmath21 system is in the @xmath87 regime , @xmath22 system is in the insulating phase . in the first case",
    "the optical response still shows the drude term , for @xmath22 only the small - polaron band at high frequency is present .",
    "again this causes large changes in the conductivity of the system .",
    "therefore the isotope effect represents another example of the sensitivity to the variation in external parameters .",
    "we have discussed the effects of an external magnetic field and of the oxygen isotopic substitution on the infrared absorption spectra for @xmath2 mainly near the phase boundary .",
    "furthermore we have dealt with the lattice effects and the @xmath18 factor without and with the magnetic field .",
    "first we have focused our attention on @xmath17 finding that , near and in the @xmath9 phase , only the sites occupied by an electron show strong lattice distortions and that the @xmath18 factor increases rapidly with temperature near @xmath13 in agreement with @xmath14 measurements .",
    "then we have examined the consequences of an external magnetic field on the infrared absorption spectra at @xmath2 stressing that , near the phase boundary , the application of the field induces a transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies @xcite and evaluating the @xmath6 ratio . in our scheme ,",
    "the found @xmath6 is due to the subtle balance between coexisting phases characterized by different lattice , spin and electronic properties .",
    "the relation between the @xmath6 ratio and the variation of the @xmath18 factor in presence of the magnetic field has pointed out the correlation that involves lattice distortions , conductivity and magnetic properties .    finally , within our approach , the oxygen isotope effect has been explained by the enhanced electron - phonon coupling that induces a reduction of the @xmath8 phases . in the vicinity of the @xmath15 transition",
    "the isotope substitution induces large changes in the optical response and in the resistivity in agreement with experimental data .",
    "@xcite    we believe that the strong sensibility of the infrared absorption with respect to the magnetic field and isotopic substitution could be used to test the validity of the @xmath87 scenario adopted in this paper .",
    "indeed the experimental study of the infrared absorption is well established and it could be able to observe the effects discussed above .    in our work , near the @xmath15 transition , the interplay of the electron - phonon interaction and the magnetic effects gives rise to a charge - density instability that takes into account experimental evidences for coexisting localized insulating and delocalized metallic components .",
    "@xcite we have assumed that the scales of the inhomogeneities are much larger than the inter - particle distance and that the term arising from the mixing energy of the two coexisting phases and including the surface energy cost is not able to change qualitatively the behavior of the macroscopic quantities discussed .",
    "we have exploited a macroscopic @xmath87 scenario where the coexisting fractions of volume are determined by the variational procedure and the maxwell construction .",

    "<S> the infrared absorption is due to the incoherent small polaron dynamics . upon cooling , </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra have showed a transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies filling up the low frequency optical gap present in the @xmath9 phase in agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in this paper , within the proposed variational approach , @xcite we calculate the lattice displacement probability distribution function ( @xmath17 ) , a quantity measurable by @xmath14 and introduced in order to study the lattice deformations due to the polaron formation.@xcite it allows to estimate the debye - waller ( @xmath18 ) factor for several @xmath16 at @xmath2 . near and within the @xmath9 phase </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath17 shows that sites occupied by an electron ( @xmath19 ) are characterized by strong lattice distortions , while sites without conduction electrons ( @xmath20 ) by a vanishing average static displacement . </S>",
    "<S> then we examine the effects of an external magnetic field on the phase diagram , the lattice distortions , the infrared conductivity and the resistivity of the system at @xmath2 . near the phase boundary </S>",
    "<S> , the introduction of the field induces a transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies in the conductivity spectra and , consequently , large variations in the resistivity . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath6 effect is due to the subtle balance between two coexisting phases characterized by different lattice , spin and electronic properties . the comparison between the @xmath18 factor in presence of the magnetic field and the magnetoresistance ratio points out the correlation between lattice distortions , conductivity and magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> finally the isotopic substitution of the oxygen from @xmath21 to @xmath22 is faced , finding that it increases the electron - phonon coupling reducing the curie temperature @xmath13 . in the vicinity of the @xmath15 transition , </S>",
    "<S> the isotope effect causes large changes of the conductivity , so that it represents another example of the sensitivity of the system to the variation in external parameters .    in sec . </S>",
