    "stars are formed inside molecular cloud cores by means of gravitational collapse .",
    "the details of the process , however , are complicated by the presence of magnetic fields and angular momentum . as a result ,",
    "in addition to infall ( or collapse ) , rotation and outflow are also seen toward star - forming regions . in theory ,",
    "a rotationally supported disk is expected to form inside a collapsing core around a protostar , from which part of the material is accreted by the protostar and part is ejected away .",
    "observationally , however , when and how a rotationally supported disk is actually formed are still unclear , because of the lack of detailed kinematic studies inside the collapsing core .",
    "this paper is a follow - up study of the hh 111 protostellar system .",
    "the properties of this system have been reported in @xcite and only the important ones are summarized here .",
    "this system is deeply embedded in a compact molecular cloud core in the l1617 cloud of orion at a distance of 400 pc .",
    "it is a class i protostellar system with a flattened envelope , putative disks , and highly collimated jets . at the center of this system",
    ", there are two sources , vla 1 and vla 2 , with a projected separation of @xmath0 ( 1200 au ) and the former driving the hh 111 jet @xcite .",
    "previous observation of this system has shown that the flattened envelope seems to be in transition to a rotationally supported disk near the vla 1 source ( lee et al 2009 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "here is a follow - up study of this system with more complete @xmath1 coverage , extending to both shorter and longer @xmath1 spacings , in 1.33 mm continuum , ( @xmath2 ) , and so ( @xmath3 ) emission obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) @xcite .",
    "this study may show for the first time a change of rotation profile in an envelope and thus how a disk can be formed inside an envelope .",
    "observation toward the hh 111 system was first carried out with the sma on 2005 december 5 in the compact - north configuration , with the results reported in @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations were then carried out on 2010 january 24 in the extended configuration for longer @xmath1 spacings to resolve the structure of the envelope and on 2010 march 26 in the sub - compact configuration for shorter @xmath1 spacings to restore the large - scale structure .",
    "the 230 ghz band receivers were used to observe the ( @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath2 ) , and so ( ) lines simultaneously with the 1.33 mm continuum .",
    "the rest frequency of the so line is assumed to be 219.949391 ghz @xcite .",
    "note that the and lines trace mainly the outflow interaction and will be presented in a future publication .    in the follow - up observations , the velocity resolution in so line",
    "was increased to @xmath0 0.28 per channel , similar to that of .",
    "also , only one single pointing toward the central region was observed in order to have enough sensitivity .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated with the mir package .",
    "the flux uncertainty was estimated to be @xmath0 15% .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were combined with that in the compact - north configuration and then imaged with the miriad package , as described in @xcite . with various different weightings ,",
    "the synthesized beams can have a size from @xmath4 to @xmath4 .",
    "the rms noise levels are @xmath0 0.06 in the and so channel maps with a beam of @xmath4 , and 1.6 in the continuum map with a beam of @xmath4 .",
    "the velocities in the channel maps are lsr .",
    "as in @xcite , the results are presented in comparison to a mosaic image based on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos image ( [ feii ] 1.64 + 2 at 2.12 + continuum ) obtained by @xcite , which shows two sources in the infrared , reflection nebulae that trace the illuminated outflow cavity walls , and the jet in the system .",
    "the two sources were also detected in 3.6 cm continuum by the vla as the vla 1 and 2 sources , respectively , at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these vla positions are more accurate than the nicmos positions and are thus adopted here as the source positions . the systemic velocity in this system",
    "is assumed to be 8.90@xmath90.14 lsr , as discussed in section [ ssec : spec ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "the velocity is relative to this systemic value .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : cont ] , the continuum emission is now spatially resolved into two components , a bright one associated with the vla 1 source and a much fainter one ( @xmath0 5 @xmath10 detection with 1 @xmath11 ) associated with the vla 2 source .",
    "the one associated with the vla 1 source is slightly elongated perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "this elongation is better seen in the clean component map , which shows a faint disk - like structure extending to @xmath0 ( 280 au ) to the north and ( 360 au ) to the south .",
    "note that in the clean component map , the central peak at the vla 1 position has a fwhm size of @xmath12 ( 240 au ) and @xmath0 90% of the flux , but no emission is detected toward the dark ridge position at the center of the reflection nebulae likely because of a lack of sensitivity . as discussed in @xcite , the emission is thermal emission from dust .",
    "thus , the emission is believed to come mainly from a dusty disk , with the inner part of which already seen with a size of @xmath0 ( 60 au ) at 7 mm @xcite .",
    "the total flux of this emission is @xmath0 300@xmath940 mjy , slightly higher than that found in @xcite because of the inclusion of the shorter @xmath1 spacings . in @xcite ,",
    "the dust was found to have a temperature of 41 - 64 k , with a mass opacity of 0.026 @xmath13 g@xmath14 and the emission being optically thin at 1.33 mm .",
    "therefore , the gas and dust associated with this emission have a mass of @xmath15 .",
    "most of this mass , however , is from the central unresolved peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the total flux toward the vla 2 source is @xmath0 11@xmath16 mjy .",
    "the mass would be @xmath0 0.005 if the emission has the same properties as that around the vla 1 source .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows the and so spectra toward the vla 1 source .",
    "these lines are detected upto @xmath0 @xmath94.0 from the systemic velocity .",
    "the so spectrum is rather symmetric and can be roughly described by a gaussian line profile , and its line center can be used here to define the systemic velocity . since part of the",
    "so emission comes from the outflow as discussed later , further observation at higher resolution is needed to refine the systemic velocity by separating the outflow from the envelope .",
    "the spectrum shows a double - peaked profile with a dip near the systemic velocity , and with the blueshifted peak brighter than the redshifted peak ( i.e. , the blue asymmetry ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the dip with the blue asymmetry could be due to self - absorption because of an infall motion in the envelope and the missing flux resolved out by the interferometer .",
    "the so emission does not show a dip , likely because it is optically thin due to low so abundance .      in order to see how the envelope structure changes with velocity",
    ", the line emission is divided into 3 velocity ranges : low ( 0@xmath171 ) , medium ( 1@xmath172 ) , and high ( 2@xmath173.7 ) velocity ranges , on the redshifted and blueshifted sides .",
    "the structure of the envelope can be clearly seen in at low velocity , as shown in figure [ fig : linemapl]a .",
    "the envelope is seen extending to @xmath0 ( 6400 au ) to the north and south from the vla 1 source , about twice as extended as that seen in @xcite .",
    "it is well confined in the equatorial plane perpendicular to the jet axis , fitting right in between the cavity walls outlined by the reflection nebulae .",
    "the detailed structure , however , is complicated . in particular , the emission in the north beyond out from the source is deviated away from the equatorial plane and the emission in the south is curvy . with respect to the vla 1 source ,",
    "the blueshifted emission is to the north and the redshifted one is to the south , as expected for a rotating envelope . as we zoom into the inner region at higher resolution",
    ", the emission appears to be aligned with the dark ridge at @xmath0 in the west of the vla 1 source ( see figure [ fig : linemapl]b and c for the central region ) .",
    "the blueshifted emission also arises from the outflow , extending to the west along the jet axis , to the northeast along the cavity wall , and to the southwest . at medium velocity",
    ", the emission shrinks toward the vla 1 source ( figure [ fig : linemapl]d ) , as expected if the velocity of the emission increases toward the source .",
    "the blueshifted peak is closer to the source than the redshifted peak .",
    "in addition , both the blueshifted and redshifted peaks shift to the east toward the equatorial plane of the vla 1 source , as compared to those at low velocity .",
    "note that the blueshifted emission also extends toward the vla 2 source and along the jet . at high velocity ,",
    "the emission shrinks even closer to the source ( figure [ fig : linemapl]e ) .",
    "in addition , the blueshifted and redshifted peaks shift further to the east into the equatorial plane of the vla 1 source , coincident with the disk - like structure seen in the continuum in the clean component map .",
    "thus , the motion at high velocity is highly dominated by the rotation , with the emission in the equatorial plane . again",
    ", the blueshifted peak is closer to the source than the redshifted peak , and here by @xmath0 .    unlike the emission , the so emission is compact with a size of @xmath12 , tracing the innermost part of the envelope . at low velocity ,",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted peaks are seen on the opposite sides of the vla 1 source in the equatorial plane ( figure [ fig : linemapl]f ) , tracing the rotation motion . that both the redshifted and blueshifted emission also extend to the opposite sides of the source could be due to an additional motion , either infall or outflow .",
    "in addition , the blueshifted emission also extends to the vla 2 source . at medium velocity",
    ", the emission shrinks toward the vla 1 source ( figure [ fig : linemapl]g ) .",
    "the peak of the blueshifted emission , however , is shifted to the west of the vla 1 source , likely due to the contamination of the emission extending to the vla 2 source and the emission at the outflow base . at high velocity ,",
    "the emission is very weak ( figure [ fig : linemapl]h ) .",
    "both the redshifted and blueshifted emission seem to be contaminated by the outflow emission , extending along the cavity walls and along the jet axis .",
    "the rotation profile in the envelope can now be better constrained than that in @xcite , with more complete @xmath1 coverage .",
    "figures [ fig : pvs]a through [ fig : pvs]c show the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams centered at the vla 1 source cut perpendicular to the jet axis in , with increasing resolution toward the inner region .",
    "the blueshifted emission is seen mainly to the north and redshifted emission mainly to the south , confirming that the motion in the envelope is dominated by rotation .",
    "the blueshifted emission beyond @xmath0 in the north shows a velocity increasing with the distance from the source ( figure [ fig : pvs]a ) .",
    "that part of the emission is seen deviated from the equatorial plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : linemapl]a ) and thus may trace an interaction with the surrounding . except for that part , the rotation velocity increases toward the source and thus could be keplerian or that has constant specific angular momentum as seen in some infalling envelopes in the class i phase ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figures [ fig : pvdat]a and [ fig : pvdat]b show the rotation velocity ( @xmath18 and the implied specific angular momentum ( @xmath19 ) , respectively , as a function of @xmath20 , which is the radius measured from the source .",
    "the data points are extracted from the pv diagrams with increasing resolution toward the inner region and marked as `` x ' 's in figures [ fig : pvs]a through [ fig : pvs]c .",
    "both the rotation velocity and specific angular momentum are corrected for the inclination angle assuming that the envelope is perpendicular to the jet axis and thus has an inclination angle of 10 to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the rotation profile can be roughly divided into two parts . for @xmath21 ( 2000 au )",
    ", the rotation velocity can be roughly reproduced by the rotation that has constant specific angular momentum ( see also figures [ fig : pvs]a through [ fig : pvs]c ) , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( or 400 au ) .",
    "the specific angular momentum there is almost constant at @xmath0 1550 au . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the rotation velocity increases slower toward the source and is better described by a keplerian law ( see also figures [ fig : pvs]a through [ fig : pvs]c ) , with @xmath25 .",
    "the specific angular momentum decreases steadily to @xmath0 300@xmath17400 au at @xmath0 100 au ( ) . note that in figures [ fig : pvdat]a and [ fig : pvdat]b , for @xmath26 , the blueshifted data points and the redshifted data points are separated from each other . as mentioned , at high velocity , the peak of the blueshifted emission in the north is closer to the source by @xmath0 than that of the redshifted emission in the south ( figure [ fig : linemapl]e ) .",
    "this difference in distance is also seen in the pv diagram in figure [ fig : pvs]c .",
    "thus , it is possible that the center of the envelope is actually located at to the south of the vla 1 source .",
    "if so , then the blueshifted data points and the redshifted data points will move closer to each other , as seen in figures [ fig : pvdat]c and [ fig : pvdat]d .",
    "observations at high angular resolution are needed to confirm this .",
    "rotation is also seen in the compact so emission near the source .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : pvs]d , the pv structure of the so emission overlaps with that of the emission near the source , tracing the rotation there . as in , the center of the pv structure seems to be located slightly to the south .",
    "the infall motion can be studied with the pv diagrams cut along the jet axis in and so , as shown in figure [ fig : pvs]e .",
    "the emission at @xmath0 @xmath171 on the blueshifted side with the position offset @xmath27 @xmath17 is from the outflow emission extending to the west along the jet axis as seen in the low and medium - velocity maps ( see figures [ fig : linemapl]c and d ) .",
    "this blueshifted emission in the west also extends close to the source , contaminating the envelope emission .",
    "also , the so emission on the blueshifted side at @xmath0 ( @xmath170.6 , @xmath17 ) extends to the vla 2 source , and thus should be excluded for studying the infall motion . excluding those parts of the emission ,",
    "the and so pv structures appear to be similar and both are roughly symmetric about the source , with the blueshifted emission shifted slightly to the west and the redshifted to the east . with the near end of the envelope tilted to the east",
    ", these pv structures , together with the double - peaked line profile with a blue asymmetry and an absorption dip at the systemic velocity ( fig [ fig : spec ] ) , suggest an infall motion in the envelope , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in order to roughly derive the structure , the physical properties ( i.e. , density and temperature ) , and the infall velocity of the envelope , a simple flattened envelope model is used to reproduce the pv diagrams , spectrum , and integrated intensity map of the emission . in this model",
    ", the envelope has an inner radius of @xmath28 , an outer radius of @xmath29 , and a half - opening angle of @xmath30 , so that its half thickness , @xmath31 , can be given in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath32 by @xmath33 where @xmath30 is measured from the equatorial plane , and @xmath34 is the minimum value of the half thickness near the source .",
    "the number density of molecular hydrogen in the envelope is assumed to be given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 au ( , as in section [ ssec : rotation ] ) , @xmath37 is the density at @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a power - law index assumed to be @xmath40 , as in many theoretical infalling models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the abundance of relative to molecular hydrogen is assumed to be constant and given by @xmath41 , as in @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the envelope is uncertain and assumed to be given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the temperature at @xmath38 and @xmath44 is a power - law index .    as discussed in section [ ssec : rotation ] , the rotation is assumed to change from that with constant specific angular momentum in the outer part to that of keplerian in the inner part .",
    "i.e. , @xmath45 with the transition radius @xmath46 at which the keplerian rotation is the same as that with constant specific angular momentum .",
    "the infall motion is uncertain .",
    "it is assumed to be in the radial direction and given by @xmath47 as in a collapsing envelope .    in the model ,",
    "radiative transfer is used to calculate the emission , with an assumption of local thermal equilibrium . for simplicity",
    ", the line width is assumed to be given by the thermal line width only .",
    "the channel maps of the emission derived from the model are used to calculate the model visibility data with the observed @xmath1 coverage .",
    "this model visibility data are used to obtain the channel maps , and then the integrated intensity map , spectrum , and pv diagrams to be compared with the observations .",
    "figure [ fig : modelc18o ] shows the comparison of the best model with the observations .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the envelope is assumed to have an inclination angle of 10 to the line of sight , with the nearside tilted to the east .",
    "the parameters that are used to reproduce the observations are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for the envelope kinematics , @xmath51 ( 60 au ) , @xmath52 ( 7200 au ) , @xmath53 ( 160 au ) , and @xmath54 8@xmath16 for the envelope structure , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 k , and @xmath57 for the envelope physical properties ( see also figure [ fig : fitpar ] for the parameter profiles ) .",
    "the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are set to those found in section [ ssec : rotation ] , resulting in the transition radius of @xmath60 ( 2000 au ) .",
    "the mass that supports the keplerian rotation is @xmath0 1.38 .",
    "thus , the mass of the central source , which can be estimated by subtracting from this mass the mass of the dusty disk close to the source , is @xmath0 1.25 . here , the inner radius @xmath28 is set to where it has a keplerian rotation velocity of @xmath0 4.5 .",
    "@xmath61 is set to be the lower end of the dust temperature @xcite . as can be seen",
    ", the simple model can reproduce the observed pv diagrams , spectrum , and integrated intensity map reasonably well . in the model ,",
    "the intensity near the systemic velocity is higher than that in the observations , probably because a large - scale envelope ( with a size larger than ) or core is needed to resolve out the emission there . also , the blueshifted emission around @xmath171 is less than that in the observations because the observed blueshifted emission there is contaminated by the outflow emission ( figure [ fig : modelc18o]b ) .",
    "moreover , as compared to the observations , the pv structure perpendicular to the jet axis is shifted slightly to the north ( figure [ fig : modelc18o]c ) , probably because the center of the envelope is indeed located slightly to the south , as discussed earlier .    as a result",
    ", the envelope can be considered as a flattened envelope that extends from @xmath0 60 to 7000 au out from the source , with a small opening angle of @xmath0 16 .",
    "it has a differential rotation , with the outer part ( @xmath0 20007000 au ) better described by a rotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the inner part ( @xmath0 602000 au ) by a keplerian rotation .",
    "the transition radius between the two parts is @xmath0 2000 au .",
    "the mass of the envelope ( including helium and molecular hydrogen ) is given by the following integration : @xmath62 thus , the mass of the whole envelope extending from 60 to 7000 au is @xmath0 0.62 , about 45% of the mass of the central source . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the inner part of the envelope extending from 60 to 2000 au is @xmath0 0.13 .",
    "since this mass is only @xmath0 10% of the mass of the central source , the rotation in the inner part of the envelope can indeed become keplerian .",
    "the envelope seems to have a small infall motion .",
    "the amount of the infall motion , however , could be overestimated due to the outflow contamination in the unresolved pv structure along the jet axis .",
    "observation at higher resolution is really needed to confirm the infall motion by separating the outflow from the envelope .",
    "with a more complete @xmath1 coverage , the envelope is detected to a two times larger extent at upto three times higher resolution than that in @xcite .",
    "the infall velocity can now be better determined with less outflow contamination , and is found to be @xmath0 40% of that derived in @xcite .",
    "the rotation profile in the inner part of the envelope can now be better constrained with a larger extent of the envelope , and is found to be more like keplerian but with a 30% higher velocity than that found in @xcite .",
    "thus , the inner part of the envelope is no longer to be consistent with a dynamically infalling disklike envelope ( or pseudo - disk ) , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "previously , the mass of the central source was derived from the infall velocity assuming a dynamical infall and found to be @xmath0 0.8 , but now is from the keplerian rotation velocity and found to be @xmath0 1.25 .",
    "in addition , the compact so envelope near the source is now better resolved and thus better separated from the outflow cavity walls .",
    "the pv structure that was seen at the outer edge of the so envelope , with the velocity decreasing with the decreasing distance from the source , is not seen here anymore . that pv structure is expected to be from the outflow walls @xcite .",
    "thus , the outer edge of the so envelope does not trace the inner edge of a pseudo - disk , as suggested in @xcite . as a result , the previous comparison of the inner part of the envelope to a collapsing magnetized rotating toroid of @xcite and @xcite is not appropriate anymore .",
    "the outer part of the envelope seems infalling toward the center with constant specific angular momentum , as found in other class i sources @xcite .",
    "the kinematics there is qualitatively consistent with that predicted in some infalling disklike envelopes ( or pseudo - disks ) , either magnetized @xcite or nonmagnetized ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the material is infalling toward the center with its angular momentum .",
    "the infall velocity is @xmath0 80% of the rotation velocity at @xmath0 7000 au at the edge of the envelope , and it drops to 40% of the rotation velocity at @xmath0 2000 au at the transition radius .",
    "therefore , in details , this part of the envelope is actually different from those collapsing envelopes found in other class i sources @xcite , where the infall velocity is larger than the rotation velocity .",
    "the hh 111 is probably in a later stage than those sources , with the motion already dominated by the rotation .",
    "the material in the envelope here is slowly spiraling inward and the centrifugal force progressively increases , so that the rotation can indeed become keplerian at @xmath0 2000 au .",
    "the infall rate in this part of the envelope is constant and given by @xmath63 this infall rate is similar to that seen in other class i sources @xcite .",
    "note that the infall rate here is a factor of 2 lower than that derived in @xcite because of a factor of 2 lower in the infall velocity derived here .",
    "an accretion shock is expected to occur at the transition radius , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this accretion shock has also been suggested to be present in the younger protostellar system l1157 @xcite at a much smaller radius at @xmath0 400 au at a much younger age in the class 0 phase .",
    "here in hh 111 , the isothermal sound speed in the envelope , which can be derived from the temperature , is @xmath0 0.15 at @xmath0 7000 au and 0.22 at 2000 au .",
    "thus , in the outer part of the envelope , the infall velocity is @xmath0 1.1@xmath171.4 times the isothermal sound speed , and is thus only slightly supersonic at that large distance . as a result , unlike that in l1157 , the accretion shock is expected to be weak at the transition radius and thus not easy to be detected .      in the inner part of the envelope , where the rotation has become keplerian , the infall velocity is uncertain and assumed to follow the same velocity profile as that in the outer part .",
    "it is @xmath0 40% of the rotation velocity .",
    "it increases from 1.4 to 2 times the isothermal sound speed from the transition radius to the vicinity of the source at @xmath0 240 au ( ) .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the infall velocity could be overestimated and it could actually be subsonic as expected for a rotationally - supported disk with a keplerian rotation . therefore , the transition radius could indeed be the centrifugal radius , where the centrifugal force is balanced by the gravitational force . if that is the case , then the rotationally supported disk is quite large with a radius of @xmath0 2000 au .",
    "a disk with such large radius has been seen in the simulations of @xcite , as a result of a gravitational collapse of a rotating spherical cloud . in their simulations ,",
    "the angular momentum is transported outward via tidally induced gravitational torque .",
    "the hh 111 system can be compared to their model h , in which the cloud was set up to have a mass of 2 and a specific angular momentum of @xmath0 1333 au at the cloud edge . in that model , the cloud initially has a radius of 13333 au and it collapses to form a quasi - static keplerian disk surrounded by an infalling envelope . at the age of @xmath64 yr ,",
    "the disk has grown up to @xmath0 1800 au in radius with a central mass of 1.121 ( see their figures 2 ) , similar to the hh 111 system .",
    "further observations at higher resolution are needed to check if the infall velocity here can really be subsonic .",
    "alternatively , this inner part of the envelope can be considered as a 2000 au sub - keplerian disk with a small infall motion . assuming that both the infall and rotation motions are due to the gravitational force from the center , then the mass of the center source would be @xmath65 times that derived earlier , and the disk would be rotating at @xmath66 96% of the keplerian velocity .",
    "a similar sub - keplerian disk with a radius of @xmath0 2000 au is also seen in the class i source l1489 irs , with a similar mass ( @xmath0 1.3 ) of the central source and a similar ratio ( @xmath0 0.4 ) of the infall velocity to the rotation velocity @xcite .",
    "a smaller rotating disk with a radius of @xmath0 600 au is also seen in the class i source iras 04365 + 2535 , with a smaller mass of @xmath0 0.5 for the central source @xcite .",
    "this disk seems to have some small infall motion too @xcite and thus can also be considered as a sub - keplerian disk .",
    "note that the sizes of these sub - keplerian disks seem to scale roughly linearly with the mass of the central source .",
    "these sub - keplerian disks are expected to become fully rotationally - supported keplerian disks closer to the source , where the infall velocity is expected to drop below the sound speed and thus become much smaller than the rotation velocity . here in hh 111 ,",
    "the rotationally - supported disk must have already formed around the source to launch the jet .    the accretion rate in the disk",
    "can be assumed to be the same as the infall rate in the outer part of the envelope . from co bullets along the jet axis",
    ", the mass - loss rate was estimated to be @xmath0 4@xmath67 in one side of the jet @xcite and thus @xmath68 8@xmath69 in two sides . therefore ,",
    "the mass - loss rate to accretion rate ratio is @xmath0 0.19 , comparable to that predicted in current mhd models @xcite . with a velocity of @xmath0 300 - 500 @xcite , the jet has a mechanical luminosity of @xmath70 6 - 16 , about 30 - 80% of the bolometric luminosity of the source , which is @xmath0 20 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corrected for the new distance of 400 pc ) . assuming a stellar mass of @xmath71 and a stellar radius of @xmath72 , the accretion luminosity is @xmath73 .",
    "this luminosity is comparable to the sum of the mechanical luminosity of the jet and bolometric luminosity of the source , as expected if both luminosities are derived from gravitational potential energy released in the accretion .",
    "the so emission is seen in the equatorial plane , with a mean radius of @xmath0 400 au ( ) .",
    "it is seen with a rotation similar to that seen in . since so",
    "emission has been found to trace warm and shocked regions @xcite , could the so emission here trace a shock in and around the disk ?",
    "the peak intensity of the so emission is @xmath74 in a beam of @xmath4 . assuming that the emission is optically thin and is from a region in lte at a temperature of 100 k @xcite , then the column density of so is @xmath75 .",
    "since the emission is not well resolved , this value should be considered as a lower limit . dividing this column density by that of h@xmath76 in the model at , which is @xmath0 6.2@xmath77 , the so abundance",
    "is found to be @xmath78 , higher than that found in the ambient material , which is @xmath0 1 - 4@xmath79 @xcite , but lower than that found in the jet , which is @xmath0 2 @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the so emission here could trace a weak shock in the inner part of the disk , such as the inner accretion shock on the disk surface @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible that the so emission traces the accretion shock between the sub - keplerian disk and the rotationally - supported disk .",
    "it has been proposed that the vla 1 and 2 sources were first formed at the dark ridge position and then ejected to the east and west , respectively @xcite . in our observations , the peaks of the emission shift from the dark ridge position to the east to the vla 1 position from the low to high velocity .",
    "this shift of the emission peaks seems to support that the vla 1 source was indeed formed at the dark ridge position and then ejected to the east , as proposed .",
    "the ejection was estimated to take place only @xmath0 3000 yrs ago @xcite .",
    "therefore , the outer part of the envelope that is seen at low velocity does not have enough time to react to this ejection .",
    "it is aligned with the dark ridge likely because it is the one that produces the dark ridge with dust extinction .",
    "no dust emission is detected toward the dark ridge position because of the low density in the outer part of the envelope .",
    "on the other hand , the inner part of the envelope that is seen at high velocity and the disk have reacted to this ejection , carried away by the vla 1 source , as seen in the observations .",
    "the envelope and disks in the hh 111 protostellar system can be better studied with more complete @xmath1 coverage than that in @xcite .",
    "the 1.33 mm continuum emission is now spatially resolved into two components , a bright one associated with the vla 1 source and a much fainter one associated with the vla 2 source , likely tracing the dusty putative disks around the two sources .",
    "the emission around the vla 1 source is elongated in the equatorial plane with a radius of @xmath0 300 au .",
    "the envelope is well seen in , extending from @xmath0 60 to 7000 au out from the vla 1 source , with the innermost part overlapping with the dusty disk .",
    "it has a differential rotation , with the outer part ( @xmath0 20007000 au ) better described by a rotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the inner part ( @xmath0 602000 au ) by a keplerian rotation .",
    "the envelope seems to have some infall motion too .",
    "the amount of infall motion , however , could be overestimated due to outflow contamination . the infall velocity to rotation velocity ratio",
    "is found to decrease from @xmath0 0.8 at the edge of the envelope to 0.4 at the transition radius and in the inner part of the envelope .",
    "thus , the material in the outer part of the envelope seems to be slowly spiraling inward with its angular momentum and the rotation can indeed become keplerian in the inner part . a compact so emission is seen around the vla 1 source with a radius of @xmath0 400 au and it may trace a shock such as an ( inner ) accretion shock around the disk .",
    "it seems that the vla 1 source was first formed in the dark ridge and then ejected to the east to its current position , as previously proposed .",
