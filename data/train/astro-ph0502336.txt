    "the lines consist primarily of hydrogen and ionized metals such as , , and with some contribution from , , .",
    "while the peculiar nature of this star was emphasized , no explanation was offered for the origin of the emission in the system .",
    "@xcite obtained high resolution spectra of xx oph over a year long baseline and found that the emission lines exhibit peculiar variabilities compared to the original observations used to classify the system as an `` iron '' star in 1924 . while no firm conclusion about the physical nature of the star was drawn , the authors suggest the structure and mass loss in xx oph may be explained through a binary interaction . @xcite",
    "argue the presence of balmer and absorption indicates the system contains a b0-b1e primary and a near - infrared excess arises due to the presence of an m6 iii secondary .",
    "these claims are backed by the presence of strong absorption against an underlying continuum in the uv @xcite and the presence of tio bands in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered signatures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in the stellar atmosphere which suggest an inferred cool component to xx oph is either carbon rich or oxygen rich with an external source of pah formation .",
    "xx oph is a photometric variable , as well .",
    "the star has historically had intermittent , one magnitude , drops in its optical flux lasting several years @xcite . in march 2004 , the flux of the star decreased by 1.5 magnitudes , reaching its faintest state in 37 years @xcite .",
    "no clear correlation between the spectral and photometric variability has been found ; xx oph experienced a photometric minimum between 1921 and 1922 with no accompanying spectral variations @xcite .",
    "the spectral similarities of the stars as 325 and xx oph were first noted by @xcite .",
    "the spectra of both stars show strong hydrogen emission lines as well as emission from ionized metals ; neither star has a normal stellar continuum in the optical . while xx oph has a diverse history in the literature , as 325 has received much less attention .",
    "it was assigned a spectral type of a7 ia+ pec in the @xcite spectral survey and type f based on strong absorption by @xcite .",
    "@xcite tentatively classified as 325 as a symbiotic star or related object .",
    "the similarly of these two stars spawned the possibility that they are two examples of one type of object .",
    "@xcite claim to see a rising blue continuum in as 325 and argue that this distinct difference from xx oph indicates the two stars are not similar .",
    "no past study has successfully attempted to consistently interpret all of the observed properties of these two systems across a range of wavelengths .",
    "also , the few infrared observations of these stars have not been used to constrain any possible models for their nature . in this paper , we present new high resolution optical spectra , high signal - to - noise near infrared spectra , and archival international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra of xx oph and as 325 and use these observations to create one cohesive picture of these peculiar systems . in @xmath0 2 ,",
    "we present the data used in our analysis .",
    "we discuss our findings in  3 before concluding in @xmath04 .",
    "table 1 lists all of the observations used in the analysis presented here .",
    "the details of the observations are summarized in the following sections according to the telescope used for the measurements .",
    "spectra of each of the `` iron '' stars , as well as a sample of neighboring stars , were obtained with the kitt peak national observatory coud feed spectrograph between 10 june 2003 and 28 june 2004 . each of the `` iron '' stars were observed in three configurations ; a `` blue '' setup was used to observe the @xmath1 3800 - 5100 range , an intermediate `` green '' setting was used to study the spectrum between and ( @xmath1 4650 - 7000 ) , and a `` red '' configuration , including and the paschen limit , covered the spectral range @xmath1 6300 - 9000 .",
    "the spectral resolution for each of these configurations was 1 - 2 and the spectra were generally obtained as back - to - back pairs of 300 second exposures which were combined to reject cosmic rays . a sample of stars near both xx oph and as 325 was observed with the blue configuration in order to search for spectral features similar to the two main stars of interest .",
    "data reduction , including bias and overscan subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration was completed using standard packages in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "spectra of stars located spatially near xx oph and as 325 , a deep spectrum of the blank sky near xx oph , and a spectrum of as 325 were obtained with the boller and chivens spectrograph on the bok 2.3 m telescope operated by steward observatory . the stellar spectra span @xmath1 3500 - 4500 with a spectral resolution of 2 while the blank sky spectrum covered 3350 - 5500 with 3 resolution .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration were completed using the ispec package developed for idl by john moustakas .",
    "ispec not only provides a robust calibration and extraction routine for long slit spectra , but also maintains the error on each measurement throughout the reduction process , resulting in a fully calibrated spectrum with meaningful errors on each pixel .      near infrared spectra of xx oph and as 325 were obtained with the uist spectrograph on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on 2003 oct 10 .",
    "uist is a 1 - 5 imager - spectrometer with a 1024x1024 insb array and a number of grisms and slits available .",
    "our single spectra used the hk grism and a long slit 0.48 `` wide at a plate scale of 0.12 '' pixel@xmath2 .",
    "this combination yielded a spectral resolution of r=800 - 1000 ( @xmath3330 ) across the 1.4 to 2.5 region .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated and telluric corrected in the normal way using spectral standard stars observed near in time and airmass to each of the program objects . at this spectral resolution , we can not obtain meaningful velocity information but the spectra were key to our detection of the stellar photosphere of the cool star in each system .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of xx oph ( swp23783 ) , as 325 ( swp38427 ) , and a comparison star , hd 87643 ( swp26040 ) , were taken from the iue archive through the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .",

    "the spectrum of each star is dominated by hydrogen emission from the balmer and paschen series as well as ionized metal emission lines . in as 325 , the metal emission lines are weaker than those in xx oph .",
    "these emission lines are accompanied by balmer absorption lines blueshifted from the emission lines in classical p - cygni profiles .",
    "xx oph shows p - cygni profiles in while as 325 contains absorption due to h+k and with no accompanying emission .",
    "p - cygni profiles are visible in all of the balmer lines except h@xmath7 which shows no clear absorption component .",
    "the line profile of h@xmath7 is quite asymmetric , in agreement with past studies in the literature @xcite ; the blue wing of the absorption line is truncated at the position of the expected absorption component .",
    "the lack of a clear absorption component probably indicates the line is optically thick , allowing repeated scattering to obscure the absorption component , while the higher energy balmer lines are optically thin .",
    "table 2 lists identifications for some of the prominent lines in each of the stars based on the same spectra shown in figures [ fig : xxophspec ] and [ fig : as325spec ] ; the observed wavelengths listed in the table are based on a single observational epoch .",
    "@xcite suggest that as 325 possesses a strong blue continuum .",
    "we find no strong blue continuum in any of our as 325 spectra including spectra taken with different instrumental configurations which were reduced independently using different reduction software .",
    "the similarities between xx oph and as 325 are striking and a strong indication that the radiative mechanisms in these two stars share common physical processes .",
    "it should be noted that the spectral fluxes between each panel in figures [ fig : xxophspec ] and [ fig : as325spec ] show some variations . in both stars , the `` green '' spectra , where were taken nearly a year later than the other spectra presented ,",
    "appear offset from the `` red '' and `` blue '' observations . in xx oph",
    ", this difference agrees well with the photometric variability of the star ( the `` green '' spectrum was obtained while the system was 1.5 mag fainter than during previous observations ) , an indication that the flux normalization is not largely in error . in as 325 ,",
    "the flux differences may be explained by photometric variability associated with the system ( though we do not have photometric observations of this star to confirm this ) or may be associated with variable seeing , transparency , and sky conditions .",
    "it should also be noted that as 325 exhibits strong variability in its emission line characteristics possibly associated with an increased mass loss rate ( see  3.7 ) which could , in turn , result in a drop in the continuum level seen in the spectra . while the reason for the flux discrepancies may be astrophysical or observational , none of the results presented here are dependent on the absolute normalization of the spectra and thus it does not affect our analysis .",
    "the metal emission lines , hydrogen emission lines , and balmer absorption lines all occur at different velocities in the spectra of the two stars .",
    "table 3 quantifies the velocities for each species in both systems .",
    "the velocities of each of the strong features of a given species are averaged to construct the ensemble velocity of that species .",
    "the reported values are the average velocities measured from data spanning several nights of observations ; typical dispersion around the mean was 80 , giving an estimate of the average error in our velocity determinations .",
    "as noted by the referee , averaging velocities measured on lines of very different strengths may lead to a biased estimate of the average velocity as less opaque lines may be formed in different layers of the wind compared to more optically thick ones . to minimize this effect",
    ", we only use the four strongest balmer lines as an estimate of the hydrogen emission line velocity . for the metal species , which also exhibit lines of various strengths",
    ", we only use the brightest 20% of the lines to determine the average velocity .",
    "the velocity structure for both systems is similar ; the absorption lines are the most blueshifted with the hydrogen emission lines , metal lines , and and lines being shifted progressively less to the blue .",
    "figure [ fig : wham ] illustrates the environment of each star from the wisconsin hydrogen alpha mapper ( wham ) @xcite .",
    "both of these stars appear to reside in regions of enhanced hydrogen emission in our galaxy .",
    "the wham kinematic data show the emission toward xx oph ( as 325 ) occurs at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . while the velocities of the interstellar gas are inconsistent with the balmer emission line velocities measured in the two `` iron '' stars , the velocities of the metals are consistent within the measurement errors .",
    "it is possible that the emission signatures in these two stars are not localized near the stars but , instead , originate in extended regions along our line of site to them ( i.e. arising from a phenomena associated with the ism alone ) . in order to probe this possibility , we obtained spectra of several similarly bright stars in the vicinity of the two `` iron '' stars of interest .",
    "table 4 lists the properties of the stars chosen for these observations .",
    "none of these stars show any sign of the emission features noted in the spectra of xx oph and as 325 .",
    "the absence of emission line features in neighboring stars may simply indicate that stars chosen for comparison are all projected in front of the origin of the peculiar emission .",
    "if the emission features we find in both xx oph and as 325 arise in an extended nebular region , a deep spectrum of nearby blank sky would reveal emission features similar to those seen in each of the `` iron '' stars .",
    "a 1200s exposure of the sky near xx oph obtained at the bok 2.3 m telescope on kitt peak revealed no emission due to metal lines .",
    "this indicates that the cause of the unusual spectra of as 325 and xx oph is intrinsic to the two systems and does not simply arise from unrelated phenomena along our line of sight to the stars .",

    "this distance to xx oph is within the 1-@xmath13 error of that determined from a hipparcos parallax , @xmath14 pc .",
    "we measured the angular size of xx oph using the palomar testbed interferometer @xcite in both h and k bands on 5 separate nights in 2003 using the north - west baseline ( 85 m ) .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated using the standard method by @xcite , utilizing three unresolved stars as calibrators : hd 161868 ( @xmath15 mas ) , hdc158352 ( @xmath16 mas ) and hd 173417 ( @xmath16 mas ) .",

    "the mean angular diameter in the h - band is @xmath22 mas , and in the k - band is @xmath23 mas .",
    "assuming a nominal 20% error in the distance of 912 pc , the stellar radii in the two bands are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "to estimate the bolometric flux from the cool component in xx oph , the component for which we measure the diameter , we fit available photometry spanning the wavelength range 5550 - 5 @xcite with a blackbody spectrum ; we find @xmath26 erg/@xmath27/sec . we calculate the effective temperature using @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bolometric flux in units of @xmath30 erg/@xmath27/sec and @xmath31 is the measured angular diameter in mas .",
    "this calculation yields effective temperatures in the h and k - bands of @xmath32 k and @xmath33 k. the derived radius and effective temperature of xx oph are consistent with that of a late - type ( m6-m8 ) luminosity class ii star @xcite , in good agreement with the spectral type we determine from our k - band spectra .",
    "it should be noted that the spectral energy distribution of xx oph is composed of both a hot and cool component , and thus any determination of the bolometric flux from one of the two stars may be contaminated by the presence of the second component .",
    "here , we use the bolometric flux only for an estimate of the effective temperature , and not for any in - depth analyses .      in order to place limits on the possible binary nature of these two systems , we examined the hydrogen emission line velocities on both long and short timescales using a combination of the strong line as well as several of the strongest paschen lines present in the spectra .",
    "since the hydrogen emission lines arise from the wind arising from the hot be star component , these emission lines can be used as a proxy to trace the kinematics of the hot star and its radial velocity motion . since these emission lines are not tied directly to the stellar photosphere but instead originate from the hot wind of the star , these emission lines are only an indirect tracer of the stellar kinematics . on the longest timescales ( months to years )",
    ", there is no sign of coherent velocity changes in the two systems .",
    "while the time sampling of our measurements is not systematic , it is still clear that there is no long - term gross radial velocity motion . on 2003",
    "july 8 , several observations of each star were obtained covering the red portion of the spectrum to look for short term variations in the velocities of the emission lines .",
    "spectra of xx oph and as 325 were obtained as alternate pairs of 300 second exposures for over three hours .",
    "the velocities of multiple hydrogen emission lines were found to show no measurable variation during the three hour period .",
    "given our resolution of approximately 2 at 6500 , corresponding to 92 , we can centroid , which is observed at signal - to - noise greater than 100 , to a level of approximately 10 ( the ability to centroid goes as the resolution over the square root of the signal - to - noise ratio in the line ) . allowing for an additional 20 uncertainty induced by the asymmetric shape of the line and possible wavelength calibration error",
    ", we place upper limits of 25 on the maximum allowed radial velocity which could be induced by a binary companion .",
    "the lack of any gross radial velocity motions on short scales rules out the presence of an massive , previously unknown , close component not directly inferred from the spectra . in order to place more stringent constraints on the long term radial motions of the stars ,",
    "time resolved k - band echelle spectroscopy , possible with current instrumentation at ukirt , is needed .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra observed by iue are compelling evidence that both stars have a strongly reddened hot component .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet spectral features likely arise in a strong , radiation driven , wind around each system . both of the stars have wide and strong absorption in the ultraviolet , probably formed in this wind . for comparison , hd 87643 ( see figure [ fig : uvspec ] ) , which shows a very similar ultraviolet spectrum to the two `` iron '' stars studied here , has a mass loss rate of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the velocity of the absorption line in xx oph ( as 325 ) of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) agrees reasonably well with the balmer absorption velocity of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) though the spectral resolution of iue ( @xmath39 ) makes interpretation of this similarity difficult .",
    "dense material in the expanding wind provides the p - cygni absorption which is observed in the optically thin balmer lines .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum , with strong signatures of absorption , is reminiscent of the `` iron curtain '' observed in novae eruptions @xcite .",
    "the narrow optical emission lines of iron and other metals are pumped by ultraviolet absorption lines through fluorescence @xcite . in as 325 ,",
    "the absorption line and the h+k lines are likely residual absorption from the the cool k giant component in that system . while most of the optical absorption lines from the cool star are erased by the hot continuum from the be star , these lines are quite strong in early k giants and thus leave a residual signature in as 325 .",
    "these line may also arise in the ism , but the agreement between the observed balmer line velocity and the and velocities , combined with the rather large equivalent widths of these lines ( 1.9 and 1.2 respectively for the stronger line in each doublet ) argue against this interpretation .      given the large amount of optical spectroscopy we have for these two stars , it is a natural extension to examine the spectral variability of each . while the gross properties of xx oph remained constant throughout our observational campaign , as 325 showed peculiar spectral signatures in 2004 .",
    "figure [ fig : compareas325 ] illustrates this difference ; the balmer absorption components become quite strong and the lines show p - cygni profiles in our newest spectrum .",
    "the appearance in the optical absorption features is likely connected to density variations in the wind . if the mass loss rate of the hot star changes , adding more material to the wind , or if the wind begins to sweep up more material from the ambient ism , the density of the surrounding gas will increase , leading to stronger absorption components .",
    "@xcite presented a spectrum of as 325 near the d absorption lines which is quite different to the spectrum presented in figure [ fig : as325spec ] . in 1987 , as 325 was observed to have strong d absorption lines , similar to those observed in figure [ fig : as325spec ] , but these absorption lines were accompanied by slightly redshifted emission peaks .",
    "the d lines did not show a p - cygni profile , but instead appear to be the superposition of two independent components .",
    "the d emission lines are not present in any of our recent observations .",
    "their disappearance may be related to changes in the photo - ionization background generated from the central hot star which in turn changes the ionization state of low ionization species such as .    in march 2004",
    ", the optical flux decreased by 1.5 magnitudes in xx oph , the deepest minimum in 37 years @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : variability ] shows the variations in the equivalent width compared to the asas-3 light curve presented by @xcite and the variation in the line shape both before and during the photometric event . in its faint state ,",
    "the equivalent width is 50% larger than before the event and the presence of the p - cygni absorption component is more pronounced after the onset of the photometric event .",
    "the appearance of the absorption component and the increased equivalent width indicates that the underlying continuum has faded from its normal state .",
    "our spectra show that the continuum flux at decreased by a factor of 6 between 5 july 2003 and 25 june 2004 .",
    "the lower continuum provides less flux to contaminate the absorption component , allowing the p - cygni profile to become clear .",
    "the change in both the photometric flux and spectroscopic features requires dramatic variability ; since evolved late - type stars tend to be highly variable , for example through pulsarations or a dynamic mass loss rate , we suspect the continuum variability is associated with late - type star .",
    "the smooth decrease in optical flux shown in figure [ fig : variability ] is remaniscent of an eclipse . while this could explain the decrease in the flux needed to produce the spectral variations , historical light curves of the system show that the system undergoes sporadic deep minima , often lasting years , remaniscent of r coronae borealis stars @xcite .",
    "althought the photometric propetries of xx oph are similar to those of r coronae borealis stars , our spectra of xx oph do not contain any of the spectral features characteristic of this class , particularly the strong swan bands which appear in deep minima .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarities between the model presented here and that invoked to describe emission from nova eruptions @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask , therefore , if the emission observed in xx oph and as 325 could be described by the nova model .",
    "the key characteristics of the spectrum of xx oph have remained constant since merrill s work in the first half of the twentieth century .",
    "in contrast , the nova phase with similar emission features lasts only a few weeks .",
    "thus , the nova interpretation can not describe the longevity of the observed features in xx ophiuchi and as 325 .    using his photographic spectra , @xcite ,",
    "measured the velocities of the metal and hydrogen emission features to be nearly the same as those presented here . in 1951 , however , the absorption component of the hydrogen lines was measured to be approximately @xmath40 , nearly a factor of four slower than we measure more recently . from the velocity differences between 1951 and 2004",
    ", it appears the structure of the outflowing wind from xx oph has changed between these two observational epochs . in order to create the measured velocity shifts , either",
    "the maximum speed of the wind or the density in the wind must have increased .",
    "an increased mass loss rate could also explain the photometric variation seen in xx oph ; if the mass loss rate increases , the system may become more heavily obscured , resulting in a drop in visible flux .",
    "future high resolution spectroscopic monitoring of both stars are needed to understand the systematics of the wind associated with this system .",
    "we have obtained new optical and infrared spectra as well as archival far ultraviolet spectra of the two `` iron '' stars xx oph and as 325 .",
    "the two stars are quite similar , contrary to claims in the literature , indicating that these two systems are examples of one class of object .",
    "our new data indicate that these stars are both binary systems with a hot be component as well as an evolved late - type star .",
    "the forest of lines observed in the optical are likely pumped by ultraviolet absorption lines through fluorescence , and the balmer p - cygni profiles arise in the expanding wind around each system . we find that the velocity of the absorption component of the balmer lines in xx oph is larger than that measured in the past , evidence that the stellar wind in xx oph has accelerated over the past fifty years - a sign that these stars are dynamic and possibly observed in a short lived phase . also , we examine the spectral variability of xx oph during a deep photometric fading and find that the shape and strength of the line changes quite strongly during the event .",
    "further follow - up spectroscopic observations are vital in order to understand the connection between the peculiar photometric and spectral variability in these stars . in order to probe the stellar properties of xx oph and as 325",
    ", infrared spectra are needed to penetrate the forest of iron lines and the continuum from the hot component which confuses the observed continuum in the optical . in a future paper",
    ", we will present near infrared integral field spectra of these two stars and an archival iso spectrum which more directly probe both xx oph and as 325 .",
    "we are grateful to kristoffer eriksen who provided many enlightening conversations about early drafts of this paper .",
    "we also thank our anonymous referee for an in - depth , critical , look at our work which resulted in a large improvement to our analysis .",

    "<S> we present new optical , near infrared , and archival ultraviolet observations of xx ophiuchi and as 325 , two proposed `` iron '' stars . </S>",
    "<S> these unusual stars have optical spectra dominated by emission lines arising from hydrogen as well as ionized metals such as iron , chromium , and titanium . </S>",
    "<S> both stars have been classified as `` iron '' stars and a number of exotic models have been presented for their origin . using two years of moderately high resolution optical spectroscopy , the first high signal - to - noise k - band spectroscopy of these sources ( which reveals stellar photospheric absorption lines ) , and new near - infrared interferometric observations </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that both systems are composed of two stars , likely binaries , containing a hot be star with an evolved late - type secondary . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen emission features arise in the hot wind from the be star while the corresponding p - cygni absorption lines are produced from dense material in the expanding , radiation driven , wind around each system . </S>",
    "<S> the optical emission lines are pumped by ultraviolet absorption lines through fluorescence . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to some claims in the literature , the spectral features of xx oph and as 325 are quite similar , evidence that they are comparable systems . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the variability of the spectral morphology and radial velocity motions of both sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the variability of xx oph during a major photometric event and find that the spectral nature of the system varies during the event . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the velocity of the absorption line components in our new spectra with those in the literature show that the structure of the stellar wind from xx oph has changed since the system was observed in 1951 . </S>"
