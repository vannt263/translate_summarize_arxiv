    "are filled according to the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "naively one might expect this also to hold for discrete energy levels and this has been assumed in various papers . unfortunately , this is not generally the case . in metallic systems",
    "the levels are very closely spaced so that the addition of an additional electron will have no effect on the distribution , whereas this is not true for a discrete level spectrum . in this section",

    "the expressions for the tunnelling rates through the right barrier are similar .",
    "it is assumed that the quantum dot can be approximated by a parabolic confining potential so that the single particle energy levels are equally spaced by an energy @xmath71 . in figures [ fig : disc1 ] and [ fig : disc4 ] the current and its associated differential conductance is plotted as a function of the applied bias for a range of energy level spacings . in numerical calculations it is possible to take into account more realistic energy level spectra , enabling a closer comparison with experiment . when it is taken into account that the total spin of the system can only change by @xmath72 with each tunnelling event",
    ", it appears that negative differential conductance may occur in specific regions @xcite .    in general a dot with closely packed energy levels yields a higher current than a dot with a sparse energy level spectrum , because of the higher number of current paths available .",
    "when @xmath73 then the metallic regime is entered .    when the energy level spacing is not negligible , the i - v characteristics are typified by two energy scales , the coulomb repulsion energy @xmath55 and the bare energy level spacing @xmath71 . as in the metallic regime ,",
    "one expects the i - v characteristic to display a current step whenever the maximum occupation of the dot increases by one .",
    "this happens with a period @xmath74 , since an extra electron not only has to overcome the coulomb barrier but also has to tunnel to the next available energy level .",
    "in addition , there is also some fine structure which has an associated period of @xmath71 .",
    "this is caused by the fact that an extra current path is created when the bias is increased by @xmath71 .    when @xmath75 the dot will be mostly maximally occupied and the most marked current increases occur whenever the coulomb blockade can be overcome .",
    "this means that the period @xmath74 is accentuated . in the opposite regime @xmath76 the dominant period",
    "is the level spacing . under normal operating conditions",
    "@xmath77 the two periods coexist ( see figure [ fig : disc4 ] ) .",
    "it is noted that at higher bias voltages the number of peaks in the differential conductance increases , as new current paths become available at different energies for different occupation numbers .",
    "only when the ratio @xmath78 is an integer do peaks corresponding to different occupation numbers coincide .",
    "the ohmic conductance through a quantum dot ( figure [ fig : discond ] ) differs from that through a metallic dot in two significant ways .",
    "firstly , the periodicity of the conductance peaks has increased by the level spacing @xmath71 .",
    "secondly , the temperature dependence of the peaks has changed its nature .",
    "an increase in temperature now not only leads to larger thermal broadening , but also to a lowering of the peak amplitude which is inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that transport proceeds through a single energy level .",
    "the temperature dependence is proportional to the derivative of the fermi - distribution function in the reservoirs @xcite .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures @xmath79 the ohmic conductance can be written as @xmath80 where the successive charge degeneracy points @xmath81 are spaced by an energy @xmath74 . for higher temperatures",
    "several levels should be taken into consideration , each of which is weighted by a factor determined by the boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "@xmath82 where @xmath83 is the joint probability that the dot contains @xmath1 electrons and that the single particle level @xmath84 is empty .",
    "note that the contributions from levels other than at positions @xmath81 are too small to cause a peak in the conductance .    apart from the i - v characteristics and the ohmic conductance , there is a third useful experiment that can be carried out .",
    "this involves applying a constant bias across the dot and studying the resultant current as a function of the gate potential .",
    "typically the source - drain bias is chosen to be less than the charging energy which isolates the effects of the energy separation of the zero dimensional states of the dot . in figure",
    "[ fig : discgate ] the current has been calculated as a function of the gate voltage for a dot with a constant level spacing @xmath85 .",
    "the thermal energy is given by @xmath86 .",
    "in accordance with some recent experiments @xcite a number of peaks and troughs can be observed in the current .",
    "all peaks and troughs can be characterised by the number of levels available to an incoming electron to tunnel onto , and the number of levels from which an electron can tunnel out of the dot . for a fermi level separation @xmath87 of @xmath88 between the reservoirs",
    "( see figure [ fig : discgate ] ) these numbers are @xmath89 .",
    "this explains why the total peak is split into two subpeaks .",
    "for the second set of graphs with @xmath90 the sequence of available tunnelling levels is @xmath91 .",
    "it is also clear that asymmetric tunnelling barriers cause the current peaks to be asymmetric .",
    "when studying the current and conductance properties of two quantum dots connected in series between the source and the drain , one obviously has to take into account the tunnelling between the dots .",
    "inter - dot transitions are qualitatively different from transitions between a dot and a reservoir .",
    "the reservoir can be assumed to have a continuous density of states , so that electrons can always tunnel elastically into and out of the reservoir .",
    "even though inelastic tunnelling events would in principle be allowed , their contribution would be relatively small compared to the elastic tunnelling rate .",
    "therefore inelastic scattering only has a significant effect on the transport through a single dot if the scattering takes place inside the dot , i.e. relaxation .",
    "as far as tunnelling between dots is concerned , it is clear that the elastic tunnelling rate is significant only when the energy levels in the dots line up .",
    "this is obviously not generally the case .",
    "usually an electron would have to interact inelastically in order to tunnel to a different energy level in the neighbouring dot .",
    "the energy difference would normally be absorbed or provided by phonons .    as a theoretical model , one can consider the double dot system to be coupled to a phonon reservoir or a heat bath with a coupling strength @xmath92 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the independent oscillators of the phonon reservoir is characterised by the density of phonon states @xmath93 .",
    "some work has been done to calculate the current through a double - barrier resonant structure with some interaction between electrons and photons @xcite .",
    "the coupling to the optical phonons creates transmission subbands which are observable in the i - v characteristics . in this section , where inter - dot transmission is considered",
    ", the interaction with acoustic phonons will be the dominant mechanism .",
    "the energy spectrum for acoustic phonons is given by the debye density of states .",
    "@xmath94 in a two - dimensional electron gas the debye temperature @xmath95 is approximately in the range @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this is of the order of a few tens of @xmath97 , which corresponds to several times the coulomb interaction energy @xmath55 .",
    "this is typically larger than the voltage drop across the device , so that one can simply use the phonon density of states below the cut - off energy @xmath98 .",
    "phonons are bosons , so that the pauli principle does not apply and states can be multiply occupied .",
    "the average occupation number of states at a given energy is given by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 where @xmath101 is the heaviside step function and @xmath102(@xmath103 ) is the energy provided ( absorbed ) by the phonon bath . the bose - einstein distribution at positive and negative values of @xmath102 differs by @xmath104 , which is indicative of the fact that a heat bath can always absorb energy .",
    "a plausible model for the inelastic tunnelling rate @xmath105 between an energy level @xmath106 in the first dot and @xmath107 in the second dot is as follows @xmath108   \\rho_{ph}(\\w'-\\w ) n_b(\\w'-\\w ) \\label{trans}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the densities of state for the energy levels .",
    "considering the dots in isolation from the reservoirs , the eigenstates can not be regarded as localised in each of the dots , but the wavefunctions will leak slightly into the other dot by virtue of the hopping potential @xmath111 .",
    "this results in the overlap integrals @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "naively this can be interpreted as the probability that the inelastic process can take place between the wavefunction components in the same dot .",
    "the wavefunctions are calculated from a simple two - dimensional hamiltonian with diagonal elements @xmath114 and @xmath115 and off - diagonal elements given by the hopping potential @xmath111 . by calculating its eigenvectors",
    "the overlap matrix can be determined .",
    "@xmath116    the density of states in the dots is broadened mainly as a result of the inelastic scattering , which is a prerequisite for the incoherent regime . to a first approximation",
    "the broadening can be considered as a lorentzian distribution @xcite with a broadening @xmath117 proportional to the phase - breaking rate .",
    "now equation [ trans ] can be rewritten as a single integral over the energy difference @xmath118 between the initial and final state .",
    "@xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "it must be stressed that the broadening of the energy levels should be much less than the temperature .",
    "otherwise it is not valid anymore to use the boltzmann distribution to calculate the occupation probabilities .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the calculation of the reservoir - dot transition rate of section [ quant_one ] .",
    "figure [ fig : t12form]a shows the energy dependence of the inter - dot tunnelling rate for the case when the energy - levels are considered to be @xmath121-functions .",
    "however , it should still be taken into account that the level broadening is large compared to the coupling between the dots , causing the peaks in the transition rate at @xmath122 to be smeared . at energy differences",
    "@xmath123 which are small compared to the broadening , the transition rate can now be approximated by a lorentzian of width @xmath124 and height @xmath125 /\\pi \\g_{\\phi}$ ] ( see figure [ fig : t12form]b ) . at larger energy differences @xmath126",
    "the function is sufficiently close to the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "as the broadening is much smaller than the thermal energy , the inter - dot transition rate for small @xmath127 can get much larger than the transition rate between dot and reservoir so that the inter - dot transition is no longer the current - limiting process . in this case",
    "it is of no relevance whether the transition rate between the dots is infinite or simply very large .",
    "this suggests that the inter - dot transition rate may be approximated by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath128 at all values of @xmath127 .",
    "this makes the mathematical analysis much more transparent .",
    "when one calculates the transition rate between dots with a given occupation number , one should sum over all possible tunnelling events according to equation [ tgen ] .",
    "the greatest contribution should come from the energy range where the electron can tunnel from levels which are mostly occupied to levels which are mostly empty . outside this window",
    "the product @xmath129 $ ] falls off exponentially .",
    "however , since the bose - einstein distribution diverges at @xmath130 , the total transition rate seems to be dominated by matching levels , even when they are situated at energies far removed from the fermi level .",
    "this is clearly an unphysical situation .",
    "this anomaly can be removed by again including the broadening in the calculation of the transition rate .",
    "alternatively , it can be argued that the transition rate for a given pair of levels is the combination of the previously defined rate and the rate at which electrons can get into an excited level .",

    "the coulomb repulsion is inversely proportional to the capacitance @xmath133 of the dot .",

    "the single particle energy level spacing is given by @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the effective mass of an electron in the two dimensional electron gas in which the quantum dot has been defined .",

    "figure [ fig : cond2 ] shows the ohmic conductance through two dots with a relatively strong inelastic tunnelling coefficient @xmath136 . in order to analyse the structure of the peaks , assume that the total occupancy of each dot can only fluctuate by one electron .",
    "moreover , assume that only a single level per dot ( at the charge degeneracy points ) contributes substantially to the transport .",
    "then the global master equation is used to obtain an expression for the ohmic conductance .",

    "@xmath143    the solution is plotted in figure [ fig : max ] .",
    "when the ratio of the inelastic tunnelling coefficient to the reservoir coupling @xmath144 is of order unity or larger , then the temperature at which a particular conductance peak reaches its maximum height is given by roughly half the energy difference @xmath145 .",

    "this calculation is in good quantitative agreement with the temperature dependence of the conductance curves of figure [ fig : cond2 ] . at higher temperatures",
    "the calculation becomes more inaccurate as several levels and more occupation numbers will start to contribute to the transport .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cond4 ] the conductance is shown for a double dot system which is identical to that of figure [ fig : cond2 ] with the exception that the inelastic tunnelling coefficient is two orders of magnitude smaller . from figure",
    "[ fig : max ] one would expect the peaks to be maximised at a temperature @xmath146 .",
    "the above description of the conductance peaks seems to apply to most of the peaks .",
    "however , it is clear that the peak which is situated at @xmath147 has an anomalous behaviour .",
    "the conductance at this point is much larger than expected .",
    "this is due to the fact that one of the lower levels in the first dot very nearly matches up with the dominant level in the second dot , thus strongly enhancing the inter - dot tunnelling rate .",
    "this effect most strongly shows up when the inelastic tunnelling coefficient @xmath148 is small compared to the coupling @xmath149 to the reservoirs .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the inter - dot tunnelling is the main current - limiting process and will therefore tend to dominate the physics .",
    "for large inelastic tunnelling coefficients the current will mainly be determined by the matching of the levels between dot and reservoir .",

    "the smaller period is simply given by the single particle spacing @xmath151 .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the current through a single dot with @xmath75 ( see section [ quant_one ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the second dot with its surrounding barriers acts as a single barrier with a reduced transparency .",
    "the electrons which have entered the first dot will tunnel into a lower energy level in the second dot at a rate of approximately @xmath136 since the levels in the dots will not normally line up . at larger temperatures",
    "the current curves will lose some features due to thermal smearing .",
    "this is clearly the case in figure [ fig : yrcurr4 ] .",
    "however , the current curve of figure [ fig : ycurr4 ] has a more complicated form at high temperatures .",
    "it has a region of negative differential conductance which occurs in the bias range where the average occupancy of the first dot increases from one to two electrons with respect to the average occupation number at zero bias .",
    "this can be explained by considering the ( unlikely ) case where a pair of energy levels matches up for a given set of occupation numbers .",
    "this will result in a highly increased tunnelling rate between the dots .",
    "when the bias across the device is raised the average occupancy of the dot will increase .",
    "this means that the dots are less likely to contain the number of electrons for which the levels lined up .",
    "consequently the tunnelling rate between the dots and hence the overall current will decrease , in spite of the fact that the total number of tunnelling paths is likely to have increased .",
    "the temperature at which negative differential conductance can occur ( if at all ) is set by the energy difference of the matching pair of levels in the dots .",
    "their energy separation has to be significantly less than @xmath152 for the tunnelling rate to increase dramatically .",
    "a higher temperature can cause some levels to match up which could not really be considered energetically close at lower temperatures .",
    "however , a higher temperature also means that there is a smaller probability that the total inter - dot tunnelling is dominated by just a single pair of levels .",
    "this will reduce the effect .",
    "the conclusion is that negative differential conductance is more likely to occur at higher temperatures , but when it occurs at a lower temperature the effect will be more pronounced .",
    "similar to the one dot case , one can extract information about the level spacing when one considers the current through the system at fixed bias @xmath153 while varying the gate voltage of one of the dots , a measurement first performed by van der vaart _ et al .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : gate2 ] .",
    "the coulomb repulsion energies and the level spacings are the same as before .",
    "the inelastic tunnelling coefficient is small compared to the dot - reservoir coupling .",
    "the empty levels are the levels that an excess electron can occupy .",
    "note that no more than a single extra electron can be contained in the dot , since this is prevented by the coulomb blockade .",
    "since electrons carry a negative charge , a rise in the gate potential causes a downward shift of the energy levels .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : gate2d ] for a range of values of @xmath87 .",
    "a few generic features can be noted which are also true for tunnelling through a single dot .",
    "firstly , the current is periodic in the gate voltage with a period @xmath150 .",
    "only a single period is shown in the figure . secondly , a significant current is only allowed to flow when the coulomb blockade is overcome in both dots .",
    "this requires the lowest available level in each dot to lie within the energy window @xmath87 .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ fig : gate2d ] where a larger bias voltage allows the current to flow at more values of the gate potential .",
    "the most striking feature of figure [ fig : gate2d ] is the occurrence of sharp current peaks .",
    "these happen at values of the gate voltage where one of the occupied states of the first dot ( containing the excess electron ) lines up with an empty level in the second dot .",
    "it is clear that this will happen with a periodicity @xmath151 ( in the figure @xmath154 ) .",
    "when the bias voltage is such that several levels in the second dot are contained within the energy window @xmath87 , then peaks will also occur at intervals @xmath155 .",
    "this is the case in the third graph of figure [ fig : gate2d ] , where @xmath156 .",
    "finally , note that the current in the valleys between the peaks increases more or less linearly with the number of peaks .",
    "this reflects the fact that at a higher gate potential there are more electrons in the first dot which are able to tunnel downwards in energy into the second dot .",
    "each tunnelling path has an associated off - resonance tunnelling rate of @xmath136 which will contribute an amount @xmath157 towards the total current ( assuming @xmath158 ) .",
    "therefore the current minima should increase by this amount every time the gate potential is increased by an amount @xmath151 .",
    "this seems to be a much more powerful method for determining the single particle level spacing than the analogous experiment with a single dot . in the model used in this chapter ,",
    "the line shape will be a multiple of the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "however , at very small energy separations @xmath127 the intrinsic width of the levels becomes significant and the lineshape will be approximately a lorentzian of width @xmath159 near resonance but will be asymmetric off - resonance .",
    "this seems to corresponds at least qualitatively to recent experiment @xcite . in the case of large @xmath160 , the middle barrier is no longer the current limiting barrier and the current will not peak anymore but simply increase with @xmath127 until a saturation value of @xmath161 is reached .",
    "further experiments will have to show whether it is justified to assume that the inelastic tunnelling rate can be approximated by the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "if this turns out to be a false assumption , then the master equation can still be used to model the effect of a more realistic inelastic tunnelling rate .",
    "for a dot with discrete levels , the distribution function at equilibrium differs from the fermi - dirac distribution , especially at low temperatures .",
    "the peaks in the ohmic conductance are spaced by an amount @xmath162 . in the i - v characteristics",
    "the effect of both the charge quantisation and the size quantisation can be observed .    the transport through a double dot has been investigated assuming that inelastic transport through the inter - dot barrier can take place by means of interaction with acoustic phonons .",
    "the main peaks in the ohmic conductance reach a maximum at a temperature @xmath152 which is at least roughly half the energy difference @xmath127 between the dominant levels in the two dots .",
    "other levels in the two dots that are well aligned can also have a significant effect on the conductance , especially when the inter - dot coupling is weak .",
    "the i - v characteristics may contain regions of negative differential conductance .",
    "this is less likely to occur at low temperatures , although its effect will be stronger than at higher temperatures .",
    "the inter - dot spacing can be analysed spectroscopically by investigating the current through the double dot at fixed bias as a function of one of the gate voltages .",
    "this produces very narrow peaks with a width that is closely related to the intrinsic level width .",
    "this method eliminates thermal smearing of the peaks ."
