    "in areas of lower extinction between the dust lanes of starbursts , observations by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) have revealed an important connection between the starburst phenomenon and a class of objects known as `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ; @xcite ) .",
    "sscs represent the most extreme mode of star formation known . aside from their extraordinary luminosities , which range from 1100 times that of the r136 cluster of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , these clusters are exceptionally compact ( radii @xmath6  pc ; @xcite ) and young ( @xmath7 few  50 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "estimates based on high - resolution spectroscopy and population synthesis models suggest that cluster masses range from 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9@xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sscs comprise a significant fraction of the uv , h@xmath11 , and @xmath12-band light emitted by young stars in starburst regions @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in these regions sscs are the basic building blocks of star formation @xcite .",
    "the similarity in size and mass of the sscs and globular clusters suggests that the sscs might be present - day analogs of young globular clusters @xcite .",
    "previously thought to form strictly in the primordial epoch of galaxy evolution , globular clusters may in fact be forming in the current epoch as sscs in starburst environments @xcite .",
    "the formation of sscs , however , is not well understood .",
    "some key questions include : how is the mass of the precursor molecular cloud , equivalent to a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , converted to stars quickly and efficiently enough for the star cluster to remain bound ?",
    "how are the conditions in starbursts different from `` ordinary '' star formation ?",
    "are there other distinguishing factors that differentiate progenitor clouds of sscs from normal gmcs ?",
    "recent studies suggest that it is high environmental pressure that increases the gas density and ultimately leads to the formation of massive star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one hypothesis suggests that a sudden galactic - scale increase in external pressure , possibly from shock compression associated with mergers , crushes entire gmcs rapidly and efficiently , forming individual sscs @xcite .",
    "co(21 ) line observations of m82 with the owens valley millimeter array ( ovro ) with 17pc spatial resolution by @xcite support this , showing that the mass spectrum of gmcs in the starburst region is indistinguishable from the upper range of the mass spectrum of sscs in m82 @xcite .",
    "these observations further show that the clouds with active star formation are in supersonic compression , with both lateral and line - of - sight velocity gradients within the individual clouds .    in this hypothesis ,",
    "the compression itself is created by the rapid ionization of the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding the progenitor gmcs .",
    "the initial ionization may be caused by the dissipation of kinetic energy in the diffuse ism of colliding galaxies .",
    "the burst of massive star formation that follows then releases enough energy to further propagate the ionization and compress nearby molecular clouds .",
    "this hypothesis for ionization - driven implosion draws a fascinating connection between the present - day sscs and the ancient globular clusters in that the globular clusters may also have formed in clouds compressed by rapid ionization in the epoch of reionization in the primordial universe at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , sscs may form in the high - pressure environment of the centers of super - giant molecular complexes ( @xmath14@xmath10 ; @xcite ) . in this hypothesis , cores that are the size of gmcs , but are within larger molecular complexes , are slowly compressed ( on a crossing time ) by the pressure of the overlying molecular gas .",
    "cluster formation proceeds as a scaled - up version of normal star formation in our own galaxy @xcite . in support of this alternative , co(10 )",
    "line observations of the antennae galaxies show huge concentrations of molecular gas that could be interpreted as super - giant molecular complexes @xcite . yet",
    "because the angular resolution of these observations ( 32@xmath1549 ; @xmath0420pc at the adopted distance of the 22mpc ) is insufficient to resolve individual gmcs , the question remains whether the appearance of the extraordinary massive clouds is simply the result of limited spatial resolution .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the antennae galaxies , ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 , with higher resolution imaging of the molecular gas to study the formation of sscs .",
    "as one of the most spectacular starbursts in the local universe , the antennae has been studied in great detail over the last several decades in various wavelengths , ranging from the x - rays to the mm / cm regime , and everything in between ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also one of the best - studied ssc populations @xcite .",
    "the overlap region of the antennae , where ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 collide , is one of the most intensely and violently star - forming regions in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) for the entire ngc  4038/39 system is high , estimated to be between 6.620 @xmath10yr@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , most of the star formation occurs in the overlap region , with sfrs of 0.72.0@xmath10yr@xmath16 for individual star - forming regions on size scales of 500@xmath151200pc@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "recent studies also find intriguing evidence for shock - driven star formation @xcite , in agreement with the @xcite model .",
    "detailed population synthesis analysis of the clusters in these regions finds the median age of the clusters to be some of the youngest in the system , @xmath710myr in many cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",

    "analysis of resolved co(10 ) clouds by @xcite , however , suggest that @xmath39 in the antennae is much larger , with an average value of 1.3@xmath1510@xmath41 ( kkms@xmath16)@xmath16 and within the errors of the galactic value .",
    "more recently , models of co and [ c  ii ] data by @xcite suggest that @xmath39 does not deviate much from the galactic value . based on these results and for consistency with @xcite , we adopt @xmath42 ( kkms@xmath16pc@xmath17)@xmath16 , which corresponds to a co  to  h@xmath43 conversion factor @xmath39 = 3@xmath1510@xmath41 ( kkms@xmath16)@xmath16 .",
    "we also assume a line intensity ratio of @xmath44/@xmath45 1.0 .",
    "@xcite find the @xmath44/@xmath46 line intensity ratio to range from 1.0 to 1.2 in the overlap region of the antennae with their single - dish observations .",
    "this is also the typical value found for nearby disk galaxies , as well as the central region of the milky way @xcite .",
    "we multiply @xmath47 by 1.36 to account for heavier elements to obtain the total molecular gas mass , @xmath48 .",
    "one concern , especially with the higher resolution imaging , is the problem of missing flux from the lack of short spacings in interferometric observations . in order to estimate the percentage of the total flux captured by our interferometric observations",
    ", we first estimate the total flux in the region covered by other observations .",
    "co(10 ) single - dish mapping of the antennae with the nrao 12 m by @xcite gives a total flux of 3172jykms@xmath16 .",
    "note that the region mapped by @xcite is much larger than the region covered by our observations or that of @xcite .",
    "they used the single - dish spectra of @xcite to estimate a total co(10 ) flux of 1654jykms@xmath16 in their smaller area mapped by the ovro interferometers .",
    "we can use the estimate of @xcite to determine the total co(10 ) flux in the area mapped by our observations .",
    "since our observations do not include ngc  4038 , we subtract 256jykms@xmath16 from wilson s estimate to obtain a total single - dish co(10 ) flux for our region of 1398jykms@xmath16 .",
    "we can compare the predicted total co flux with the flux measured in our interferometric observations .",
    "we determine the flux by summing up the fluxes of the clouds found by clumpfind in our combined sma@xmath30pdbi data .",
    "we obtain a total flux of 1358jykms@xmath16 , which is very close to the single - dish flux assuming a line intensity ratio of @xmath44/@xmath49 1.0 .",
    "if we assume a line intensity ratio of @xmath44/@xmath49 1.1 @xcite , then we are missing only @xmath012% of the total flux .",
    "this indicates that most of the co mass may be in discrete clouds rather than distributed in the diffuse ism in the overlap region .",
    "note that this may not be the case for regular star - forming disks , where the gas tends to be more diffuse .",
    "lower cutoff thresholds in clumpfind yield total fluxes of 1472 and 1614jykms@xmath16 for the 2.5 and 2@xmath31 thresholds , respectively , which imply that noise clumps may be picked up as real clouds at these threshold levels .      with the clumpfind parameters adopted in ",
    "[ section.clumpfind ] , we detect a total of 132 clouds .",
    "we list all the clouds and their basic properties in table [ table.clumps ] .",
    "as expected , if we use the lower detection thresholds , clumpfind extracts a larger number of clouds ( total of 332 and 224 clouds for the 2 and 2.5@xmath31 thresholds , respectively ) .",
    "most of the new clouds detected with the lower thresholds are low mass and unresolved  the number of clouds with log  @xmath50 6.5 doubles and triples with the 2.5 and 2@xmath31 thresholds and therefore are not significant in our analysis .",
    "we find a large range of values for the basic properties of the 132 clouds ( figure [ fig.threepanel ] and table 3 ) .",
    "the molecular masses ( discussed in   [ section.massflux ] )",
    "span over 3 orders of magnitude in dynamic range , from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , with a mean of @xmath53 , a median of @xmath54 , and standard deviation ( calculated in log space ) of 1.0 dex .",
    "one of the most interesting characteristics of the mass distribution is that it appears distinctly bimodal , with a maximum around our sensitivity limit of @xmath55 and clear secondary maximum near @xmath56 .",
    "the exact location of the minimum is somewhat arbitrary , within the range of log  @xmath57 . from considerations of the mass function (   [ section.massspec ] ) ,",
    "we pick a fiducial value of @xmath58 to separate the two populations . with this choice , there are 68 clouds in the low - mass group and 64 clouds in the high - mass group , whose respective median masses are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "values of radius and velocity dispersion estimated by clumpfind are corrected for spatial and spectral resolution following equation a7 from @xcite .",
    "we find that the radii of the clouds span a very large range , from @xmath61 to 317pc .",
    "of the 132 clouds found , 64 are unresolved spatially .",
    "we assign an upper limit of 80pc to the radius of these clouds , half of our minimum resolution diameter of 160pc . using the kaplan - meier product - limit estimator @xcite , which properly accounts for the upper limits ,",
    "we find a mean radius of 119.2@xmath627.3pc and a median value of 77.0pc for the entire sample .",
    "the distribution of sizes , like that of mass , appears bimodal .",
    "in fact , given the large fraction of upper limits at the small-@xmath63 end of the distribution , the true separation between the two peaks must be even greater than it appears . splitting the sample into the low - mass and high - mass groups defined above",
    ", the respective mean and median radii become @xmath63 = ( 57.0@xmath627.1 , 48.0 ) pc and ( 180.6@xmath628.8 , 170.0 ) pc . in light of the large number of upper limits ,",
    "the statistics for the low - mass subsample should be treated with caution .",
    "the clouds on the upper end of the size distribution are larger than any known gmcs in the milky way @xcite or in nearby disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "while blending may be an issue ( but see arguments below as to why we do not think this is a major problem ) , at face value the largest clouds represent a distinct class .",
    "@xcite described these very large clouds as super - giant molecular complexes .",
    "our spatial resolution of 80pc is high enough to resolve the most massive clouds into smaller clouds , but nonetheless they appear to be single entities .",
    "there is very good correspondence between cloud size and cloud mass ; the most massive clouds are also the largest in physical extent .",
    "the corollary implication , therefore , is that the most massive clouds in our sample are intrinsically as massive as they appear .",
    "their exceptionally high masses are not a spurious artifact of insufficient resolution .",
    "this is one of the central results of this study .    of the 132 clouds found ,",
    "86 are resolved in velocity , with velocity dispersions ( @xmath64 ) ranging from 0.825.6kms@xmath16 . for the unresolved clouds",
    ", we assign an upper limit of 4.9kms@xmath16 , the channel size of our data cube .",
    "there is an overlap of 45 clouds that have limits in both radius and velocity dispersion .",
    "note that a few clouds have radius and/or @xmath64 smaller than the upper limit because they were bright enough to be resolved . unlike the sizes and masses , the distribution of velocity dispersions is not as cleanly separated between the high - mass and low - mass groups , although lower mass clouds tend to have lower values of @xmath64 .",
    "we calculate a mean and median velocity dispersion of 7.8@xmath620.6kms@xmath16 and 6.2 kms@xmath16 , respectively , for the sample as a whole .",
    "considered separately , the low - mass and high - mass groups have mean and median dispersions of @xmath64 = ( 2.6@xmath620.3 , 2.0 ) kms@xmath16 and ( 13.3@xmath620.6 , 12.0 ) kms@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "again , the statistics of the low - mass group may be uncertain because of the large fraction ( 68% ) of upper limits .        l|rrr|rrr|rrr|ll    all clouds & 119.2 & 7.3 & 77.0 & 7.8 & 0.6 & 6.2 & 7.3 & 1.0 & 6.5 & & + log @xmath65 & 180.6 & 8.8 & 170.0 & 13.3 & 0.6 & 12.0 & 7.6 & 0.5 & 7.2 & @xmath231.44@xmath620.14 & 4.01@xmath621.01 + log @xmath66 & 57.0 & 7.1 & 48.0 & 2.6 & 0.3 & 2.0 & 5.7 & 0.4 & 5.4 & @xmath231.39@xmath620.10 & 3.02@xmath620.59      we show the intensity - weighted velocity and velocity dispersion map of our combined sma@xmath30pdbi co(21 ) data in figure [ fig.mom1mom2 ] .",
    "consistent with previous interferometric studies of molecular gas in the antennae @xcite , we find that the kinematics of the molecular gas in the overlap region are extremely complicated .",

    "intensity - weighted velocity dispersions are large  often @xmath6750kms@xmath16  most likely due to multiple clouds along the line of sight , which we will discuss later .",
    "this does not contradict our conclusion that we can resolve individual clouds because clumpfind differentiates by velocity as well as spatially .",
    "the velocity map gives the _ average _ velocity at any given position , weighted by the co intensity , so velocity information could be blurred out if there are multiple clouds along the line of sight . to preserve some velocity information , we made individual first moment maps for the 50 brightest clouds extracted by clumpfind , using the masks provided by the algorithm .",

    "the detections alone give @xmath71 , but this ratio drops to @xmath72 if we properly take the upper limits into account .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ section.massflux ] , there is some debate over whether @xmath39 is much smaller in the antennae @xcite .",

    "in other words , _ the clouds are gravitationally bound structures_. this is a key point .",
    "it implies that the extreme properties of the largest clouds  their large sizes , internal velocities , and masses  are unlikely to be artifacts of spatial or velocity blending .",
    "if they were , then it would be a coincidence that the radii and velocity dispersions of the clouds would conspire to have just the right combination to produce @xmath77 .",

    "there are only one or two clouds found using the 3@xmath31 threshold with the same behavior , which reinforces our earlier conclusion that some of the additional low - mass clouds extracted using the 2 and 2.5@xmath29 detection thresholds may not be significant above the noise .",

    "clouds found by @xcite in their co(32 ) observations of the antennae , which were also obtained with the sma and at a resolution comparable to ours , also lie above the galactic @xmath63@xmath64 relation .",

    "matching our co(21 ) clouds with the co(10 ) clouds from @xcite is difficult given the difference in resolution ( 32@xmath1549 compared to 33@xmath1515 ) , but we note that most of the co(10 ) clouds have velocity dispersions @xmath8410kms@xmath16 , significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion observed in the co(32 ) and co(21 ) clouds .",
    "the large offset in the @xcite velocity dispersions are especially curious .",
    "the typical size - linewidth relation in galactic @xcite and extragalactic @xcite clouds predicts that clouds found by higher density tracers such as co(32 ) should have smaller velocity dispersions if they trace smaller size scales , precisely the opposite of what @xcite observe .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the offset in velocity dispersion for the largest clouds . assuming that the milky way gmcs represented by the solid line in figure [ fig.sizeline ] are in virial equilibrium ( @xmath85 )",
    ", the size - linewidth relation ( @xmath81 ) found by @xcite implies that @xmath86  that all the milky way clouds have similar gas surface densities . for the gmcs in the @xcite sample",

    "@xcite find that the overlap region has exceptionally high hcn ( a high gas density tracer , @xmath89  @xmath90 ) emission , equivalent to half of the total hcn emission in the system .",
    "furthermore , the overlap region is extremely bright in the far - infrared ( fir ; @xcite ) , which is known to be well - correlated with hcn @xcite .",
    "this correlation has been shown to hold for a wide range of size scales , from dense galactic cores to extreme , high - redshift starbursts @xcite .",
    "we can roughly estimate the average h@xmath43 number density in each cloud from its co brightness , assuming the mass is distributed uniformly within a sphere .",
    "@xcite found that the average number density ( @xmath91 ) varies inversely as the cloud diameter @xmath92 [ @xmath93 , implying that the _ column density _ is essentially independent of size .",

    "this is consistent with the argument for higher surface densities , and could also be the explanation for the even larger offset of the @xcite data .",
    "another possibility is the presence of elevated external pressure . in the galactic center ,",
    "@xcite find gmcs that have extremely large velocity dispersions  approximately a factor of 5 larger at a given radius than the clouds in the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite argue that the large velocity dispersions from turbulence keep the clouds in equilibrium with high external pressures that arise from hot gas and/or magnetic fields in this region .",
    "the overlap region of the antennae may also be experiencing higher pressures as the region of contact between two gas - rich galaxies undergoing a major merger .",
    "the shocks produced under such violent conditions , especially in the overlap region , could generate high interstellar pressures and high turbulence .",
    "higher @xmath95 transitions of co are more sensitive to shocked gas , and hence the higher velocity dispersions of the @xcite clouds may be due to the increased sensitivity of co(32 ) to collisions and turbulence .",
    "@xcite attribute the gmcs that have higher velocity dispersions in their sample to blending of multiple clouds .",
    "this , too , is a distinct possibility in our data , given the complex geometry and kinematics of the overlap region in the antennae .",
    "recent work has shown that clumpfind has difficulty accurately measuring cloud parameters in crowded fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a few of our spectra in figure [ fig.clumps_velo ] show hints of multiple peaks that could be interpreted as incomplete deblending by clumpfind .",

    "one of the most remarkable features of the mass function is that there is a distinct break around log  @xmath109 , which coincides with the most massive galactic clouds @xcite .",
    "this break appears to be robust with respect to the detection threshold , showing up in both the 2 and 3@xmath29 levels .",
    "detailed examination of the ( @xmath110 ) coverage and amplitude versus ( @xmath110 ) distance of our sma and pdbi observations does not reveal any gaps that could introduce a break in the mass function .",
    "the break corresponds to the `` gap '' in the distribution of masses shown in figure [ fig.threepanel ] and is the basis for our motivation to divide the cloud population into two subsamples .    for the sake of concreteness , we chose the threshold to be log  @xmath111 .",
    "we perform two fits : one in the range 4.7  @xmath112log  @xmath105@xmath84  6.5 , and a second in the range 6.5  @xmath112log  @xmath105@xmath112  8.5 .",
    "we find @xmath113 for the first fit and @xmath5 for the second fit .",

    "if we exclude the two end points ( log  @xmath114 and 6.5 ) where the two distributions appears to turn over , the slopes for both the low- and high - mass ranges are then steeper , with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "these slopes are all statistically consistent with @xmath117 found by @xcite .",
    "note that if we use a distance of 19mpc to be completely consistent with @xcite , the break remains apparent at log  @xmath118  6.3 and the respective fits have slopes @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "additionally , we find that if we run clumpfind with the lower detection thresholds , the slopes of the mass function at the low - mass end increases slightly ( from @xmath231.39 to @xmath231.68 ) , while the slope of the high - mass end remains relatively constant within the errors .",
    "we find that the break between the low- and high - mass differential mass function also remains constant with different detection thresholds ; it remains log  @xmath121 for all three thresholds that we tested .",
    "the slopes of our mass function are well - matched to the slope of the mass function for young clusters in the antennae , @xmath122 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the good agreement between the gmc mass spectrum and the upper range of the ssc mass spectrum in m82 @xcite , suggesting that individual star clusters may be closely related to individual clouds .",
    "our fit over the mass range 6.5  @xmath112log  @xmath123@xmath84  8.5 suggests that some of the largest super - giant molecular complexes found by @xcite break up into smaller clouds in our high - resolution observations .",
    "importantly , many of the large clouds _ remain _  large despite the improved spatial resolution of our observations , which is sufficient to resolve the larger structures even at our highest resolution .",
    "the largest clouds in our data are much larger than gmcs in our galaxy and typical star - forming galaxies ( 1100pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "returning to figure [ fig.threepanel ] and table 3 , we see that the two populations below and above the break have statistically different properties .",
    "while the clouds with 6.5  @xmath112log  @xmath123@xmath84  8.5 tend to be large ( @xmath63  100pc ) and have high velocity dispersions ( @xmath64  10 kms@xmath16 ) , the less massive clouds tend to be largely unresolved in both radius ( @xmath63  80pc ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath64  4.9 kms@xmath16 ) .",
    "also intriguing is the _ spatial distribution _  of the clouds in figure [ fig.big_clumps ]  the more massive clouds are associated with peaks of intense star formation (   [ section.sf ] ) , while the population of smaller , less massive gmcs resides in more quiescent areas far from the peaks .    in summary , these results suggest a bimodal distribution of giant molecular clouds / complexes in the antennae : a regular , quiescent population that is similar to typical gmcs in nearby galaxies and the milky way , and a second population that appears much larger , more turbulent , and unusually massive .",
    "the exceptional properties of the largest clouds appear connected to the extreme conditions associated with the interaction zone of the merging galaxies .",

    "we explore the relationship between dense molecular gas and star formation by comparing the co emission with various tracers of recent and on - going star formation .",

    "these clusters are identified as compact sources in _ hst _  optical images @xcite .",
    "all our co clouds have sscs nearby .",
    "however , the sscs are identified in the optical and are not good tracers of embedded or current star formation .",
    "we also consider the relationship between current star formation and the distribution and intensity of molecular gas , velocity gradients , and other signatures of shocks and compression in our co data that may provide insight into the nature of ssc formation .",
    "we focus on three star formation tracers with the highest spatial resolution available  h@xmath11 emission from the recombination of gas ionized by young , massive o and b stars , 8 @xmath129 m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) heated by star formation , and 4 cm radio continuum from either h  ii regions or young supernova remnants .",
    "the h@xmath11 data were taken with the f658n filter on the _ hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) by @xcite , the pah maps were acquired using the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) by @xcite , and the 4 cm continuum map was taken by @xcite with the very large array ( vla ) .    @xcite estimate that @xmath05% of the 8 @xmath129 m emission comes from diffuse gas heated by older stars , so we subtract this component from the 8@xmath129 m image following @xcite , by scaling the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath129 m channels to match the colors of m0 iii stars .",

    "fir emission peaks from _ herschel _ pacs 70@xmath129 m imaging are marked with crosses , consistent with the 8@xmath129 m pah and continuum peaks within its 55 resolution limit .",
    "note that the absence of a fir counterpart for the central 8@xmath129 m pah/4 cm continuum peak is due to the coarser resolution of the 70@xmath129 m imaging blending the two peaks together .",

    "this means that in a straight first moment map , much of the velocity information is lost due to averaging .",
