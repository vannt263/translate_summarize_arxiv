    "since the discovery of the cosmic acceleration @xcite , dark energy has become one of the most important research areas in modern cosmology @xcite . from the last decade , although a variety of dark energy models have been proposed to explain the reason of cosmic acceleration , the physical nature of dark energy is still a mystery .",
    "the dark energy problem may be in essence an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the holographic principle is a fundamental principle of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "based on the effective quantum field theory , cohen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath17 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. , @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath3 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff of the system ) . in this way ,",
    "the uv cutoff of a system is related to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "when we consider the whole universe , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle can be viewed as dark energy , and therefore the holographic dark energy density becomes @xmath20 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless model parameter which modulates the dark energy density @xcite . in @xcite , li suggested that the ir length - scale cutoff should be chosen as the size of the future event horizon of the universe , i.e. , @xmath21 this leads to such an equation of state of dark energy @xmath22 which satisfies @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , an accelerated expanding universe can be realized in this model . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdew ] ) , the function @xmath26 is determined by the following coupled differential equation system @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimensionless hubble expansion rate , and @xmath30 .",
    "note that in this paper we only consider a spatially flat universe .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model described above is a viable and physically plausible dark energy candidate , as an alternative to the standard cosmological constant model ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the model has been widely studied both theoretically @xcite and observationally @xcite .",
    "the data used in these works mainly include the type ia supernovae ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , the direct measurement of hubble constant , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) .",
    "these works show that the hde model can provide a good fit to the data , and @xmath33 is favored by the data .",
    "for example , a recent analysis reports the 68% confidence level ( cl ) constraint @xmath34 from _",
    "wmap_-7+snia+bao+__hst _ _  @xcite . in this march , the european space agency ( esa ) and the _ planck _",
    "collaboration publicly released the cmb data based on the first 15.5 months of _ planck _ operations , along with a lot of scientific results @xcite .",
    "they show that the standard six - parameter @xmath3cdm model provides an extremely good fit to the _ planck _",
    "spectra at high multipoles , while there are some discrepancy at @xmath35 .",
    "some cosmological parameters , e.g. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , are measured with unprecedented precision .",
    "interestingly , the _ planck _",
    "values for some @xmath3cdm parameters are significantly different from those previously measured . for the matter density parameter , the _ planck _",
    "data give @xmath39 ( 68% cl ) @xcite .",
    "this value is higher than the _ wmap_-7 result @xmath40 @xcite and the _ wmap_-9 result @xmath41 @xcite , and is in tension with the snls3 result @xmath42 @xcite . for the hubble constant , _",
    "planck _ gives a low value @xmath43 , which is in tension with the results of the direct measurements of @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 reported by riess _",
    "@xcite , and @xmath46 reported by freedman _",
    "the discrepancy is at about the 2.5@xmath6 level .",
    "they also show that , the _ planck _ constraints of @xmath47 and @xmath44 , although are in tension with snls3 and _ hst _ observations , are in agreement with the geometrical constraints from bao surveys @xcite .",
    "the _ planck _ data also improve the constraints on dark energy @xcite .",
    "actually , the results can be significantly different if the _ planck _",
    "data are combined with different astrophysical data sets . for a constant @xmath14 model ( here after , @xmath14cdm model ) , the _ planck _",
    "results give @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( 95% cl ) by using cmb combined with bao and union2.1 @xcite data , respectively , which are consistent with the cosmological constant .",
    "however , when combined with snls3 data and @xmath44 measurement , the results are @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 cl ) , respectively , favoring @xmath53 at the 12@xmath6 level . for a dynamical equation of state @xmath54 , the results from the _ planck_+wp+bao and _ planck_+wp+union2.1 data combinations are in agreement with a cosmological constant , while the _ planck_+wp+@xmath44 and _ planck_+wp+snls3 ( here , wp represents the _ wmap_-9 polarization data ) results are in tension with @xmath55 at the more than 2@xmath6 level .",
    "based on the arrival of a bunch of new data sets , it is very important to re - analyze the hde model in light of _ planck _ and _ wmap _ 9-year data .",
    "this will enable us to answer a lot of interesting questions : what are the constraint results of the cosmological parameters in the hde model from the _ planck _ data ?",
    "what is the difference between the fitting results of _ planck _ and _ wmap _ ?",
    "what are the results if we combine the _ planck _ data with the bao , snia , and _ hst _ data ?",
    "whether are they consistent or in tension with each other ?",
    "since the hubble constant @xmath44 is correlated with the hde parameter @xmath4 , can hde help us to relax the tension between the _ planck _ data and the direct measurements of @xmath44 ?",
    "since a phantom dark energy can reduce the tt power spectrum amplitude at large scales , can hde help us to relieve the mismatches between theoretical and observational power spectra at @xmath35 ?",
    "the @xmath56 temperature power spectrum showed anomalous fitting results of the lensing parameter @xmath57 in the @xmath3cdm model ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , can hde help us to remove or relieve this `` anomaly '' ?",
    "the main task of this paper is to find firm , reliable answers to these stimulating questions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , we give a brief introduction to the data used in this work and our method of data analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cmb ] , we present and compare the fitting results of hde by using the cmb - only data of _ planck _ and _ wmap_-9 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : otherdata ] , we combine the cmb data with the external astrophysical data sets including bao , snls3 , union2.1 and _ hst _ , and discuss the fitting results and the tensions . some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] . in this work ,",
    "we assume today s scale factor @xmath59 , so the redshift @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61 .",
    "we use negative redshifts to represent the future ; in this way , @xmath62 corresponds to the infinite future when @xmath63 .",
    "the subscript `` 0 '' indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity unless otherwise specified .",
    "to analyze the hde , we modify the ` camb ` package @xcite to incorporate the background equations of the hde model . furthermore , to investigate the dark energy perturbations , we apply the `` parameterized post - friedmann '' ( ppf ) approach @xcite .",
    "this method of dealing with dark energy perturbations has been widely used by _ wmap _",
    "@xcite and _ planck _ teams  @xcite . in our previous work of hde data analysis @xcite ,",
    "we have already employed this method into our pipeline .    the same as @xcite , we sample cosmological parameter space with markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method with the publicly available code ` cosmomc ` @xcite . for each analysis",
    ", we execute about 816 chains until they are converged , satisfying the standard gelman and rubin criterion @xmath64 @xcite . to make sure that the tails of the distribution are well enough explored",
    ", we also check the convergence of confidence limits with the setting ` mpi_limit_converge ` = 0.025 in ` cosmomc ` .",
    "the base @xmath3cdm model has the standard `` six - parameter '' as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the current density of baryon and cold dark matter , respectively , @xmath68 is @xmath69 times the approximation to @xmath70 in ` cosmomc ` ( @xmath71 is the comoving size of sound horizon at baryon - drag epoch , and @xmath72 is the angular diameter distance ) , @xmath73 is the thomson scattering optical depth due to reionization , @xmath36 is the scalar spectrum index at the pivot scale @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the log power of the primordial curvature perturbations at @xmath76 .    in the following , we will also discuss the holographic dark energy model and the @xmath14cdm model , each of which has an extra parameter to describe the dynamic evolution of dark energy . for hde model , the extra parameter is @xmath4 , as described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhohde ] ) , and for @xmath14cdm model , the extra parameter is @xmath14 .",

    "at the same time , the _ planck _",
    "likelihood softwares are also made publicly downloadable .",
    "the likelihood software provided by the _ planck _",

    "lensing is detected independently in _ planck _ 100 , 143 , and 217 ghz channels with an overall significance of greater than 25@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational lensing data are good at constraining dark energy through the lensing effect coming from the distortion of the large scale structure that emerged after @xmath83 ( at this stage , the universe is dark energy dominated ) .    in the following context",
    ", we will use `` _ planck _ '' to represent the _",

    "to study the difference between the fitting results by using _ planck _ and _ wmap _ data , in this work we also perform the analysis of hde by using _ wmap_-9 data .",
    "the data and likelihood software are downloadable at the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",

    "planck _ or _",
    "wmap_-9 .      the cmb data alone are not powerful in constraining dark energy parameters , since dark energy affects the late time cosmic evolution .",
