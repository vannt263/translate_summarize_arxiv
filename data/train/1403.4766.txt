    "modeling and understanding of magnetic materials in their high - temperature paramagnetic phase is among the most challenging problems for theoretical solid state physics . to design new magnetic materials , it is important to be able to calculate the free energy , thermodynamic stability , and properties of magnetic materials not only in their magnetic ground state but also in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "chromium nitride is a material of this type where accurate modeling of the paramagnetic phase and the transition to the antiferromagnetic phase at high pressure is crucial to understand its mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "these mechanical properties are of direct practical importance as crn is a hard ceramic material with several technological applications .",
    "it is used as a component in commercial protective coatings , e.g. , craln and ticraln@xcite .",
    "+ crn thin films reduce to cr@xmath0n after heat treatment in vacuum at around 900 k@xcite but this temperature is significantly increased upon alloying with aln  @xcite and a combination of aln and tin  @xcite .",
    "the calculated phase diagram using the frisk sublattice model indicates that crn dissociates at temperatures above 1800 k@xcite . here",
    "we present calculations up to 2000 k covering the entire range of temperatures where crn has been proposed to be stable .",
    "we have also studied the effects of vibrations and vibrational entropy on free energies at high temperatures .",
    "+ crn has been observed in two structural phases with different magnetic states . above room temperature",
    "it has the paramagnetic rocksalt structure with a magnetic disorder of local spin moments @xcite .",
    "depending on synthesis conditions and stoichiometry , crn goes through a magnetic and structural phase transition from the paramagnetic ( pm ) cubic state to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) orthorhombic phase at temperatures between 270 - 286 k@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that application of relatively small pressures in the range of a few gpa can stabilize the afm state at room temperature @xcite .",
    "+ an important contribution to the magnetic behavior of this system comes from the strong electron correlations of the cr 3d - states , not fully captured by standard local density or generalized gradient approximations for exchange and correlations within density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the importance of these types of correlations has been investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in order to obtain a complete picture of the crn phase transition .",
    "when simulations aim at describing the material at elevated temperatures , magnetic calculations should be performed assuming a disordered magnetic state .",
    "this is possible within the framework of the disordered local moments ( dlm ) method @xcite .",
    "the method was originally implemented within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite used two different supercell implementations of the dlm method to study the effect of magnetic disorder of crn , the magnetic sampling method and a magnetic version of the special quasirandom structure ( sqs ) @xcite approach .",
    "they studied the thermodynamic and electronic properties of crn in a static lattice approximation @xcite .",
    "+ in order to include vibrational effects in the study of the paramagnetic phase at high temperatures , particularly the equation of state , @xcite merged _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) with the magnetic sampling treatment of dlm , creating the disordered local moments - molecular dynamics ( dlm - md ) method .",
    "the influence of pressure and temperature on crn compressibility was then investigated with this dlm - md technique @xcite .",
    "the dlm - md approach has also been used to calculate mixing enthalpies of cubic cr@xmath1al@xmath2n and demonstrate that this alloy system is thermodynamically stable with respect to isostructural phase separation at elevated temperatures  @xcite .",
    "+ however , the contribution of the full vibrational free energy , including vibrational entropy , to the thermodynamic phase stability of paramagnetic crn as a function of temperature has not yet been investigated . here",
    "we combine two techniques : dlm - md and the temperature dependent effective potential ( tdep ) method recently developed by @xcite .",
    "the tdep method provides a way to obtain a temperature dependent harmonic approximation of the lattice dynamics with implicit inclusion of anharmonic effects .",
    "it is based on using a second order hamiltonian fitted to the potential energy and interatomic forces calculated from _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics at finite temperatures . as a result",
    "the phonon dispersion relations and free energies as a function of temperature are obtained .",
    "+ the objective of this paper is to combine the dlm - md and tdep methods to calculate the free energy of a paramagnetic system at finite temperatures , in order to provide a better understanding of the coupling of magnetic disorder and vibrations , and their contributions to the phase diagram of crn .",
    "first - principles calculations were performed using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics and the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . for the cubic phase of crn with disordered magnetic moments we applied born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics . for the orthorhombic phase with ordered magnetic moments we used the extended lagrangian born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics method @xcite . to describe electronic exchange - correlation effects we used a combination of the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite with a hubbard coloumb term ( lda+@xmath3 ) @xcite and the double counting correction scheme suggested by @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath3 was applied only to the cr 3d orbitals and the value was taken as 3 ev calculated by @xcite . generated supercells for both the orthorhombic and cubic phases contained 32 chromium and 32 nitrogen atoms arranged in @xmath4 conventional unit cells . in the orthorhombic unit cell",

    "we used the same cutoff radius of the force constants for both structures to ensure that the results are comparable .",
    "the plane wave energy cutoff was set to 400 ev .",
    "we used a monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite for integration of the brillouin zone using a grid of @xmath4 k - points .",

    "the principle of the dlm - md method is to treat the magnetic disorder using a finite size cell . using the dlm method and considering the local moments of the paramagnetic state to be disordered",
    ", we perform our calculations within the traditional born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics framework . in the dlm - md method the magnetic state of the system",
    "is changed randomly during the md run .",
    "therefore , we deal with a magnetic state which exhibits order neither on the length scale of our supercell nor on the time scale of the simulation . preserving the net magnetization of the system to be equal to zero",
    ", the magnetic state of the system is rearranged randomly with a time step given by the spin flip time ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "an md simulation is then performed with a time step @xmath9 @xmath11 @xmath10 .",
    "the time between spin rearrangements is set to 10 fs . according to @xcite , in terms of its impact on energetics ,",
    "this is practically equivalent to an adiabatic approximation with spin dynamics being much faster than nuclear motions .",
    "the spin state of the system is randomized while the lattice positions and velocities are kept as they are and the simulation continues .",
    "this procedure allows for a direct time - averaging of potential energies and forces between atoms over the dynamically changing magnetic states , approximating the real dynamical magnetic disorder .",

    "[ fig : magnetic_moment ] . but even keeping the magnetic moment fixed on 2.82 for @xmath48 for @xmath50 gives negligible differences in the phase diagram .",

    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",

    "thus , the harmonic contribution to the potential energy due to lattice vibrations is very similar in both the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic and cubic paramagnetic phases of crn , while about half of the effect of taking lattice vibrations into consideration comes from the anharmonic potential energy term .",
    "+ at this point it is worth pointing out that @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath52 in zero temperature calculations , for standard non - magnetic or ordered magnetic cases , and therefore the difference between the two calculations in our case is remarkable . note that we use the same software for the static and dynamic simulations , and that our analysis of numerical issues , such as k - point convergency , that could influence the comparison gives an uncertainty of at most 10 k. what differs between the two methods is first the modification of the potential energy surface with temperature , and secondly the coupling of the magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom through the dynamically rearranged magnetic state during the vibrations.it was established earlier that the potential energy difference between different crystal structures may strongly depend on temperature if one of them is dynamically unstable @xcite , but for dynamically stable systems it is generally assumed that the potential energy surfaces do not change with temperature . in particular , in the state - of - the - art quasiharmonic approximation one calculates @xmath51 and just adds it to the dft potential energy @xmath52 , calculated at zero temperature .",

    "the orthorhombic phase has a broader optical band , but also here the cubic phase has its band center at lower frequencies .",
