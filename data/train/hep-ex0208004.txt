    "between may 31@xmath2 , 1996 and july 15@xmath3 , 2001 super - kamiokande ( sk ) exposed 22,500 tons of purified water for 1496 days to solar neutrinos .",
    "the detector is described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "solar neutrinos are detected using the cherenkov light emitted by the recoiling electron from neutrino - electron elastic scattering .",
    "this water cherenkov detection technique offers four advantages : ( i ) the reconstructed direction of the recoiling electron is strongly correlated with the neutrino direction , ( ii ) the time of each neutrino interaction is recorded , ( iii ) the neutrino spectrum can be inferred from the recoil electron spectrum , and ( iv ) neutrino - elastic scattering is sensitive to all neutrino flavors , although the cross section for @xmath4 and @xmath5 is about six to seven times less than for @xmath6 .",
    "however , only high energy solar neutrinos can be observed in this fashion ; sk analyzes data above a threshold of 5 mev of the total energy of the recoil electron .",
    "only extremely few solar neutrinos have an energy that high ; they arise from the @xmath7 decay of @xmath8b ( @xmath8b neutrinos ) and @xmath9he - proton fusion ( _ hep _ neutrinos ) in the sun .",
    "the standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction of the flux of those rare neutrinos ( @xmath10@xmath11s and @xmath12@xmath11s with no uncertainty given  @xcite ) is therefore difficult and beset by large uncertainties .",
    "sk uses the known position of the sun ( at the time of a solar neutrino event candidate ) to statistically separate solar neutrino interactions from background events . during 1496",
    "effective days 22,400@xmath13 solar neutrino interactions were found in the gray shaded forward peak of figure  [ fig : cossun ] . from monte carlo calculations based on the ssm , 48,200@xmath14 are expected . in spite of the large neutrino flux uncertainty ,",
    "the elastic scattering rate is significantly less than expected from the ssm .",
    "the suppression factor data / ssm  mc is about @xmath15 less than one : 0.465@xmath16(stat.)@xmath17(syst.)@xmath18(ssm ) .",
    "all solar neutrinos are born as @xmath6 in the sun ; if all solar neutrinos _ detected by sk _",
    "are @xmath6 s as well then a @xmath6 flux of 2.35@xmath19(stat.)@xmath20(syst.)@xmath21@xmath11s leads to the observed interaction rate .",
    "sno has measured the charged - current interaction rate of solar @xmath6 with deuterium  @xcite ( above a threshold neutrino energy of about 7 mev ) implying a @xmath6 flux of 1.76@xmath22(stat.)@xmath23(syst . ) ( assuming an undistorted @xmath8b neutrino spectrum ) and consequently 16,800@xmath24 @xmath6 interactions in sk .",
    "sk has observed 1.334@xmath25(stat.)@xmath26(syst.)@xmath27(sno ) more events which is about 4.5@xmath28 above one .    beyond the @xmath8b endpoint of @xmath29 mev , _ hep _ neutrinos",
    "dominate the solar neutrino flux .",
    "taking into account energy resolution , an optimum _ hep _ neutrino search window ( 18 to 21 mev ) was defined using monte carlo . in that window @xmath30 events",
    "were observed ; one _ hep _ neutrino interaction is expected .",
    "this limits the _",
    "flux to be less than @xmath31@xmath11s ( or less than 7.9 times the ssm flux ) at 90% c.l .     at 90% c.l .",
    "the left panel assumes the @xmath8b spectrum , the right panel uses monochromatic neutrinos at eight energies . the black data points statistically subtract spallation background.,width=283 ]",
    "if there are antineutrinos in the solar @xmath32 flux , they could be detected by an inverse @xmath33 reaction on hydrogen . unlike elastic scattering (",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cossun ] , those events are reconstructed within about 60@xmath34 of the forward direction ) , the angular distribution of this reaction is essentially flat , with a slight backward bias , especially for low energy neutrinos .",
    "the positron energy is strongly correlated with the antineutrino energy .",
    "after solar neutrino interactions are removed using an angular cut of 60@xmath34 , the dominant background at higher energy ( above 8 mev ) is due to cosmic ray - induced spallation .",
    "figure  [ fig : nubarlimit ] shows two upper flux limits at 90% c.l . :",
    "( i ) all events below @xmath35 are considered to be antineutrino interactions ( ii ) spallation background is statistically subtracted .",
    "the limits of the left plot ( in % of the ssm @xmath8b flux ) assume antineutrinos with a @xmath8b energy spectrum , the limits given in the right plot ( in /@xmath11s ) are for monochromatic antineutrinos of eight different energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeseas ] shows the time variation of the neutrino flux inferred from the sk rate in bins of ten days and 1.5 months .",
    "a 7% yearly variation is expected due to the 3.5% change in distance between sun and earth ( assuming the neutrino flux is proportional to the inverse square of this distance , that is , the sun is a neutrino point source ) .",
    "the data favor such a 7% variation over no variation by about 2.5@xmath28 .",
    "no significant time variation is seen after subtraction of this effect . to search for daily variation ,",
    "the data was binned according to solar zenith angle @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zenith ] displays the resulting distribution . no significant daily variation is found .",
    "the result can be summarized by forming the `` day / night asymmetry '' @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 meaning `` day rate '' and @xmath39 meaning `` night rate '' ) : @xmath40(stat.)@xmath41(syst . )",
    "is consistent with zero within 0.9@xmath28 .        figure .",
    "elastic scattering flux as a function of solar zenith angle .",
    "note the suppressed zero.[fig : zenith ]     correlated uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the @xmath8b @xmath32 spectrum and the sk energy scale and resolution .",
    "all data points are dominated by statistical uncertainty except the combined rate.,width=283 ]",
    "for precision measurements of the spectrum it is necessary to calibrate the absolute energy scale ( and determine the energy resolution ) of sk with an outside source .",
    "we employed an electron linear accelerator to determine the energy scale within 0.64% and the resolution within 2.5%  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : dnspec ] the observed recoil electron spectrum is compared to the expected spectrum : the ratio _ data / ssm _ effectively plots spectral distortion .",
    "there is no significant spectral distortion ; the fit to the no - distortion hypothesis results in @xmath42 d.o.f . corresponding to 44.3% c.l .",
    "the @xmath43 includes three systematic effects which will shift all bins of the distribution in a correlated way ( correlated uncertainties ) : the uncertainty in ( i ) the @xmath8b @xmath32 spectrum , ( ii ) the absolute sk energy calibration , and ( iii ) the sk energy resolution .",
    "the gray lines of figure  [ fig : dnspec ] show the size of the sum ( in quadrature ) of ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the same figure also plots the day / night asymmetry as a function of recoil electron energy .",
    "the day / night asymmetry is consistent with zero regardless of the recoil electron energy .",
    "the plotted correlated uncertainty is the sum of only ( ii ) and ( iii ) , since ( i ) is the same for the day and the night .",
    "solar neutrino oscillations explain both the observed sk rate reduction compared to the ssm prediction _ and _ the observed sk rate enhancement relative to the sno - based expectation ( mentioned in section  [ sec : flux ] ) as conversion of @xmath6 into other active flavors , that is @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "they also explain the rates observed by various radio - chemical solar neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "solar neutrinos are always born as @xmath6 ; their conversion probability into @xmath4 or @xmath5 in vacuum is determined by their energy and the distance of flight and the oscillation parameters . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we assume just two massive neutrinos ; in that case the oscillation parameters are the mixing angle @xmath44 ( controlling the relationship between flavor and mass eigenstates ) and the differences of the squared masses between the two neutrinos @xmath45 .",
    "the presence of matter strongly influences this conversion probability .",
    "in particular , the matter density in the sun is high enough to induce resonant conversion  @xcite at solar neutrino energies for a wide range of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 to @xmath47ev@xmath48 ) . in that case , the conversion probability is large or even maximal , even if the mixing angle is small .",
    "the matter density in the earth also affects the conversion probability leading to apparent daily variations of the solar neutrino flux .    .",
    "the shown values of both the @xmath43 and the day / night asymmetry contours increase logarithmically . superimposed in gray",
    "are the usual solution areas.,width=283 ]        depending on @xmath44 and @xmath45 , sk can therefore observe distortions of the recoil electron spectrum , yearly variations or daily variations . in figure",
    "[ fig : specdistdnexp ] , the expected spectral distortion and day / night asymmetry are shown for all values of @xmath49 and @xmath45 ( the spectral distortion is quantified by a @xmath43 method which uses the current sk uncertainties as input ) .",
    "overlaid are the traditional oscillation `` solutions '' , an area of parameter space capable of explaining all measured solar neutrino rates .",
    "the conversion probabilities for the large mixing angle ( lma ) , small mixing angle ( sma ) and low @xmath45 ( low ) solutions are dominated by the matter effects mentioned previously , while the vacuum solutions ( vac ) match the first oscillation phase maximum to the solar neutrino energy range .",
    "lma , low and vac have a large mixing angle close to @xmath50 while the mixing of the sma is small ( a few @xmath51 ) .",
    "sma and vac solutions predict a distorted spectrum , lma and low solutions daily variations .",
    "figure  [ fig : zenspec ] summarizes the data used for a simultaneous search for spectral distortions and daily variations : the zenith angle spectrum has eight energy bins and seven solar zenith angle bins between 5.5 and 16 mev .",
    "the @xmath43 for a flat shape hypothesis is @xmath52 d.o.f . which corresponds to 58.1% c.l .",
    "overlaid are the oscillation predictions ( fit to the data by varying freely the total @xmath8b and _ hep _ neutrino flux ) for four selected parameter pairs , each representing a solution .",
    "the strong energy dependence of the flavor conversion ( inducing spectral distortions ) predicted by vac and sma is not supported by the data . in case of lma and low , there is little energy dependence of the flavor conversion , the apparent spectral distortion shown in figure  [ fig : zenspec ] is caused by a larger ratio of the _ hep _ to the @xmath8b neutrino flux than predicted in the ssm .",
    "these two solutions can only be distinguished by their daily flux variation predictions .",
    "lma shows rapid oscillations during the night .",
    "these oscillations are washed out for the coarse bins of the data .",
    "the low solutions however predict _ slow _ oscillations in the night .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of the observed flat distributions would be more consistent with slow oscillations of the opposite phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : osc ] shows the strong constraints on solar neutrino oscillation parameters which are imposed by the sk spectral distortion data ( cross hatched areas ) and the sk zenith angle spectrum ( gray areas ) .",
    "a fit to two spectra ( day and night ; see gray dashed lines ) _ partially _ includes the zenith angle variation which is _ fully _ included in the zenith angle spectrum fit .",
    "the analysis is described in  @xcite ; the definition of the @xmath43 employed to extract those constraints can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the areas in the left panel of figure  [ fig : osc ] are excluded and use only the ( zenith angle ) spectrum shape while the right panel shows allowed areas based on this shape _ and _ the sk rate ( and the ssm @xmath8b flux ) .",
    "sk rate and spectrum allow only large mixing angles .",
    "the large daily variation predicted between @xmath53 and @xmath54ev@xmath48 splits this `` large mixing band '' into two distinct allowed areas ( sk lma and sk low / quasi - vac ) .",
    "the @xmath45 limits of these areas are stronger for the zenith angle spectrum compared to the day / night spectrum , especially the upper limit for the sk low / quasi - vac which is reduced by a factor of two to three .",
    "[ fig : zenspecosc1 ] area excluded at 95% c.l . by the shape of the sk zenith spectrum ( gray area ) .",
    "the exclusion is independent of all ssm @xmath32 flux predictions .",
    "overlaid is the allowed area ( inside thick black line shaded in light gray ) from the sno day / night spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the overlap of both is shaded dark gray .",
    "the cross hatched area is allowed by the rate of the homestake experiment  @xcite and the ssm prediction of that rate .",
    "similarly , the gray lines mark the boundary of the area allowed by gallex / gno  @xcite and sage  @xcite .",
    "figure  9 compares the constraints of the zenith angle spectrum ( gray area ) with the allowed areas of the sno day / night spectrum  @xcite , the homestake experiment and the combined `` gallium experiments '' ( gallex / gno and sage ) .",
    "all sno small angle ( @xmath55 ; in particular the one at @xmath56 , which is consistent with the gallium experiments ) , vac ( consistent with homestake and the gallium experiments , including the one at @xmath57 ) , and low solutions ( consistent with homestake and the gallium experiments ) are excluded . the sno lma solutions ( consistent with all experiments )",
    "are restricted to a smaller range .",

    "unique _ solution is obtained , when sk results are combined with all other solar neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "the strongest constraints that are independent of ssm neutrino flux predictions come from fits which combine the sk zenith spectrum shape with the sk and sno rates  @xcite .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ fig : combined ] shows the allowed regions of this fit . superimposed is a combined fit of the sk zenith spectrum shape and the gallium , homestake and sk rates which relies on the ssm neutrino flux predictions . in either case",
