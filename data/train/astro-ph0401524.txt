    "since liners ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ; heckman 1980 ) were first identified as a class the nature of the source of ionization has been debated , with the two main possibilities being a starburst or agn nuclear source .",
    "if an agn is responsible for the ionization , the next question is how similar are these agn to seyferts and qsos .",
    "an interesting development has been the discovery of broad @xmath9 emission in many liners @xcite .",
    "these liners are almost certainly agn powered , particularly when they are observed in early - type galaxies where outflows from massive stars and/or supernovae are not expected to be relevant .",
    "early - type galaxies also tend to harbor very massive central black holes , making broad - line liners observed in early - type galaxies ideal laboratories for studying ( potentially ) low accretion rate physics . of course , this is assuming that the x - ray emission is isotropic and scales with accretion rate , however alternatively the accretion energy may be dissipated anisotropic and/or non - radiatively ( i.e. , in outflows ; di matteo et al .",

    "we initially produced model psfs using scisim .",
    "however , the current version of scisim ( 3.0.0 ) does not specifically model the psf - dependence of the individual filters , and also only models the psf as a single gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , the resultant psf fwhm was @xmath42  which is similar to that expected for the uvw2 filter and therefore we proceeded with this psf model for that filter . in the case of the u band filter we instead produced a model psf by generating double gaussian images and adjusting standard deviations of the two gaussians and their relative normalization until the encircled energy function ( i.e. , the integrated radial profile ) matched the values given in the om calibration file om_psf1drb_0006.ccf . in the surface brightness",

    "_ xmm - newton _ guest observer facility , private communication ) . to check the calibration of the u band magnitudes",
    ", we computed the the ( total ) count rate of ngc 3998 and another galaxy in the u band fov , ngc 3990 , and derived u band magnitudes of 11.92 and 13.94 .",
    "these values can be compared to the rc3 u band magnitudes of 12.13 and 13.81 , respectively , or differences of 0.21 and 0.13 .",
    "this implies that the flux calibration is indeed accurate to at least @xmath69 . as with the uv flux , the nuclear u band flux",

    "[ specsec ] , there is a negligible contribution from hot gas to the spectrum ( as would be expected since ngc 3998 is not a star - forming galaxy ) . from this plot , it appears that the flux of ngc 3998 was fairly constant during the measurements but may have been a factor of @xmath5 higher during the _ bepposax _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",

    "however , ngc 3998 differs in two important respects from typical seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "first , the lack of strong x - ray variability is in contrast with typical seyferts , particularly on short time scales , since the trend there is for variability to increase with decreasing luminosity @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that this is typical of liners and llagn ( including ngc 3998 ) and that the x - ray source regions are larger in liners and llagn than in typical seyferts .",
    "one possibility is that the x - ray production is occurring in optically - thin flows ( see below ) rather than flares in optically - thick accretion disks .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is also remarkably featureless in contrast with typical seyfert 1 galaxies , particularly with the lack of any fe - k emission at 6.4 kev .",
    "the upper - limit to the equivalent width ( ew ) in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax _ joint fit is 25 ev .",

    "it is also evident that in the optical band , only the hst data with @xmath127 apertures are sufficient to exclude large contributions of extra - nuclear flux .",
    "given the large low - mass star contribution to near - ir emission of early - type galaxies , this is also true for the near - ir band .",
    "the relative amounts of flux in the om u band and hst foc u band suggests that this contribution is at least 90% , and likely to be much larger at longer wavelengths .",

    "we also show an approximate comptonized thin - disk model that fits the x - ray data from ngc 3998 without over - predicting optical or ir flux . this thermal comptonization model ( implemented in xspec as `` comptt '' ; see titarchuk 1994 , hua & titarchuk 1995 ) uses the wien approximation to black body flux for computational efficiency , however this should be a reasonable approximation . in this model",
    "there are 5 parameters : the overall normalization , the temperature of the wien component , the temperature and optical depth ( @xmath217 ) of the hot plasma , and a geometry switch to select a spherical or disk geometry . in general inverse - compton spectra",
    "tend to be power - laws with a slope of @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the mean amplification of the photon energy per scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that for a given wien and plasma temperature combination , @xmath217 could be adjusted to result in our observed power - law slope and hence give a good fit .",
    "the fits generally resulted in a power - law extrapolated from the peak of the wien component , and we therefore initially fixed the temperature of the wien spectrum at @xmath220 kev ( @xmath221 ) to see if the power - law could be extended to the optical bandpass .",

    "clearly the value of @xmath217 is not meaningful since our data do not constrain the geometry or temperature of the hot plasma .",
    "these fits ( simultaneously to the _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax _ data ) resulted in @xmath17/dof = 1653 - 1654/1567 , or basically equivalent to the pure power - law fit .",
    "the fit with a plasma temperature of 200 kev and a disk geometry is shown in figure [ sedplot ] .",
    "we computed a mcd spectrum ( with inner radius = @xmath222 and outer radius = @xmath208 ) consistent with the wien component by assuming an inclination angle of 60 degrees and adjusting @xmath210 , which resulted in @xmath223 .",
    "such a model accounts for the spectrum of ngc 3998 from the optical to @xmath224 kev , i.e. , the optical flux is consistent with the extrapolation of the power - law observed in the x - ray band , particularly if we allow for variability in the foc f480lp flux ( the offset between the pds point in figure [ sedplot ] and the comptonized spectrum model is due in part to the fact that the x - ray data were unfolded assuming the simple power - law spectrum extending to 100 kev ) .",
    "however this model requires that a _ negligible _ fraction of the emission longward of the optical is due to the agn in ngc 3998 .",
    "this may be unlikely given the compactness of the radio and mid - ir emission .",
    "of course there is some degeneracy between the inclination angle and accretion rate of the disk in this scenario , with an angle of 0@xmath39 and @xmath225 also being consistent with the wien component .",
    "however the luminosity of the mcd disk component is not arbitrary .",
    "the mcd spectrum is given by the sum of blackbody spectra with temperatures varying as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is radius of each point on the surface of the disk @xcite .",
    "this results in a spectrum similar to a single blackbody emitting at the peak temperature of the disk , and for given black hole mass the peak temperature scales as @xmath216 .",
    "of course the luminosity of a blackbody emitting over a given surface area is proportional to @xmath228 , where h@xmath229kt .",
    "therefore we could not match the luminosity of the mcd component for other disk temperatures by simply adjusting the accretion rate since the expected luminosity of the wien component would move in the @xmath230 plane along a slope of 4 rather than 0.9 .",
    "this makes the comptonized mcd model inconsistent with the observed x - ray power - law if the peak disk temperature is below @xmath231 kev ( i.e. , the wien component normalization would be larger than the mcd expectation ) , and also at higher temperatures this model is only consistent with the data if the mcd component is attenuated ( e.g. , by inclination effects ) . also note that the optical ( uv ) flux would not be due to the accretion disk for disk temperatures in excess of @xmath232 kev .",
    "conversely , assuming that the optical and uv data are due to a thin disk requires that @xmath233 .",
    "finally , note that a standard @xmath0 disk is both stable and optically thick when @xmath210 is in the range discussed here ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "in addition to a very low accretion rate , another possibility is that both the radio and x - ray flux from ngc 3998 are due to a jet , as has been suggested recently for llagn such as ngc 4258 @xcite , ic 1459 @xcite and ngc 4594 @xcite . along these lines",
    "we show a simple broken power - law model in figure [ sedplot ] , where we found that the radio data were consistent with a slope of @xmath235 ( i.e. , with @xmath236 ) and break frequency of @xmath237 hz .",
    "this is obviously an overly simplistic model but here the radio slope is due to optically - thick synchrotron emission and the x - ray emission is due to optically - thin synchrotron emission , modeled by @xcite as being due to the outer , `` post - shock '' portion of the jet .",
    "the markoff - falcke model also predicts a mid - ir `` bump '' due to synchrotron emission from the inner , `` pre - shock '' jet which may be consistent with the mid - ir fluxes observed in ngc 3998 .",
    "alternatively , the synchrotron emission may break to a flatter slope and the x - ray is again also due to inverse - compton emission , and the mid - ir and/or optical - uv flux is due to a standard @xmath0 disk @xcite .",
    "clearly these models would also be consistent with the sed of ngc 3998 and may imply accretion rates possibly orders - of - magnitude higher than the riaf and comptonized @xmath0-disk models since a large fraction of the accretion energy would be released kinetically in the jet .",
    "however , as was the case in the sed modeling discussed above , any @xmath0 disk in this scenario would likely still need to be truncated to avoid over - predicting the optical and uv fluxes . also ,",
    "the lack of any short - term , large - amplitude x - ray variability may argue against the x - ray emission being dominated by a ( relativistic ) jet .",
    "the fe - k lines in seyfert 1 galaxies are assumed to originate from reflection from a thin disk and/or matter further out such as the putative `` torus '' in the standard model @xcite .",

    "none of the accretion models account for the compact radio emission in ngc 3998 which is probably dominated by a jet .",

    "<S> we present the results of a 10 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of ngc 3998 , a `` type - i '' liner galaxy ( i.e. , with significant broad h@xmath0 emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to test the extent to which radiatively - inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) models and/or scaled - down agn models are consistent with the observed properties of ngc 3998 . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law fit to the _ xmm - newton _ spectra results in a power - law slope of @xmath1 and 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , in excellent agreement with previous hard x - ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> the om uv flux at 2120   appears to be marginally resolved , with @xmath5 of the flux extended beyond 2  . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear component of the 2120   flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the x - ray power - law , although @xmath5 of the flux may be absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> the om u flux lies significantly above the x - ray power - law extrapolation and contains a significant contribution from extragalactic emission . </S>",
    "<S> the upper - limit for narrow fe - k emission derived from the _ xmm - newton _ spectra is 33 ev ( for @xmath6 ) . the upper - limit for narrow fe - k emission derived from a combined fit of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax _ spectra is 25 ev , which is one of the strictest limits to date for any agn . </S>",
    "<S> this significantly rules out fe - k emission as is expected to be observed in typical seyfert 1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray flux of ngc 3998 has not been observed to vary significantly ( at @xmath7 level ) within the x - ray observations , and only between observations at a level of @xmath5 , which is also in contrast to typical seyfert 1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of _ any _ reflection features suggests that any optically - thick , geometrically - thin accretion disk must be truncated , probably at a radius of order 100 - 300 ( in schwarzschild units ) . </S>",
    "<S> riaf models fit the uv to x - ray spectral energy distribution of ngc 3998 reasonably well . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the mid - ir flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component that might be present . </S>",
    "<S> the uv to x - ray sed is also consistent with a comptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate ( @xmath8 ) , in which case the lack of fe - k emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> accretion models in general do not account for the observed radio flux of ngc 3998 , and the radio flux may be due to a jet . </S>",
    "<S> recent jet models may also be consistent with the nuclear fluxes of ngc 3998 in general , including the x - ray , optical / uv and mid - ir bands . </S>",
    "<S> the ( ground - based ) near - ir to optical photometric data for the nuclear region of ngc 3998 contains large contributions from extra - nuclear emission . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive nuclear fluxes using archival hst wfpc2 data , resulting in meaningful constraints to the nuclear sed of ngc 3998 in the optical band . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a possible om u band and usno - b detection of the ngc 3998 ulx . </S>"
