    "recently , a diphoton signal excess at 750 gev was reported in the data of large hadron collider ( lhc ) run 2 with @xmath1 collisions at energy @xmath2 tev @xcite .",
    "it can be explained by a sm singlet @xmath0 , with production cross section @xcite , @xmath3 the local significance of this excess is about 3.9 @xmath4 and 2.6 @xmath4 for atlas and cms , respectively , and it was not seen in the data of lhc run 1 with @xmath5 tev @xcite .",
    "although no excesses in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , dilepton and dijet channels @xcite were observed yet both in the old data of run 1 and the first data of lhc run 2 , this bump has stimulated great interests .    in this paper , we consider the interest of building connections between the sm singlet scalar @xmath0 responsible for the diphoton excess and weakly - interacting massive dm models . inspired by the construction of sm higgs - portal dm models @xcite , in which the dm communicates with the sm particles via the higgs mediator , we propose @xmath0-portal dm model by replacing the higgs scalar with @xmath0 . for discussions about dm roles in diphoton excess in eq.([excess ] ) ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "our construction of @xmath0-portal dm obviously differs from the higgs - portal dm models due to obviously different mediator scalar mass and yukawa coupling .",
    "but they indeed share a common feature , i.e. , they are both effective theories at the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we define our model introduce model parameters . in sec",
    ".  [ sec3 ] , we consider the constraints on @xmath9-sector from diphoton excess in eq.([excess ] ) and 8-tev limits at lhc .",
    "in particular , parameter space should be consistent with the 8-tev @xmath10 limit .",
    "dm of type either a sm singlet scalar or dirac fermion are both addressed . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we consider the constraints on dm - sector from dm relic abundance @xcite and direct detection limits @xcite . in sec .  [ sec4 ]",
    "we add a few comments on dm direct detection at lhc run 2 . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "we assume that the effective theory of new physics model includes a scalar @xmath0 responsible for the diphoton excess , a fermion @xmath9 charged under sm gauge group @xmath11 with electric charge @xmath12 in unit of @xmath13 , and a sm singlet scalar dm ( @xmath14 ) or a sm singlet fermion dm ( @xmath15 ) . the tev - scale effective lagrangian @xmath16 for this model is given by , @xmath17 where @xmath18 we identify @xmath19 gev and ew scale @xmath20 gev .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath21 in the case for scalar dm has been normalized to a dimensionless parameter . for either a scalar or fermion",
    "dm there are four following model parameters in eq.([lag ] ) , @xmath22 similar to higgs - portal singlet scalar dm @xcite , a @xmath23 parity , under which @xmath14 is odd and the others are even , is employed to keep dm stable .",
    "instead of writing the interactions between @xmath0 and gluons and photons via operators with mass dimension five , in ( [ lag ] ) we consider an explicit realization via fermion @xmath9 . into vector - like quark models .",
    "we temporarily assume that those fermions ignored here are not relevant for our study . ]",
    "the advantage is obvious , as the number of model parameters are reduced .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    .",
    "limits in the data of lhc run 1 are shown in curves , above which regions are excluded.,width=384 ]",
    "the decay channels for @xmath0 include @xmath24 and an extra one @xmath25 in the low mass region @xmath26 .",
    "some of these magnitudes satisfy @xmath27 while the others such as @xmath28 are all of the same order .",
    "obviously , larger branching ratio @xmath29 in eq.([width ] ) can be obtained by choosing larger @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we simply choose the electric charge 5/3 for @xmath9 for the following facts .",
    "at first , the dark matter phenomenology discussed in sec .",
    "iv does not significantly affected by the choice on electric charge slightly bigger than @xmath30 for @xmath9 as favored by the diphoton excess at 750 gev .",
    "secondly , those results arising from electric charge @xmath30 in sec.iv are useful reference for the case where @xmath9 is also charged under @xmath31 singlet , the electric charge for @xmath9 can be alternatively chosen bigger than @xmath30 .",
    "see our previous work @xcite for relevant discussion .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath9 is further charged under @xmath32 , the mass region @xmath33 gev has been excluded by the 8-tev lhc data @xcite for the assumption @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , see ref .",
    "@xcite for lhc lower mass bounds for @xmath35 . ] . in the setting on small other than large decay width for @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath36 is restricted to be above @xmath37 .",
    "the production cross section @xmath38 is mainly through gluon fusion , the magnitude of which depends on yukawa coupling @xmath39 and fermion mass @xmath36 .",
    "given the fact that the decay width ratio @xmath40 is nearly fixed for the explicit choice on electric charge @xmath12 , the diphoton signal strength @xmath41 is sensitive to @xmath39 and fermion mass @xmath36 . in fig.[signal ]",
    "the yellow band corresponds to the contours of observed diphoton signal strength , with limits in the data of lhc run 1 are shown in curves .",
    "it indicates that the narrow region in the yellow band below the limit given by @xmath42tev can explain the diphoton excess and is consistent with the following limits @xcite at @xmath43-tev lhc simultaneously , @xmath44 it also implies that the value of @xmath39 as required is in the perturbative region for @xmath36 below 2 tev .    :",

    "the yukawa interaction between dm and @xmath0 responsible for diphoton excess provides the @xmath46-channel annihilation @xmath47 as shown in the left panel of fig.[feynman ] .",
    "this annihilation should account for the dm relic abundance as measured by the plank and wmap 9-year data @xcite , @xmath48    by employing micromegas @xcite we show in fig.[relic ] the contours of @xmath49 in the parameter space of @xmath21 and @xmath50 with dm either a scalar or dirac fermion for three representative choices on @xmath51 gev .",
    "@xmath52 in fig.[relic ] shows that once @xmath53 is opened in the mass region @xmath54 , annihilation cross section significantly increases , which leads to smaller @xmath21 as required by the relic abundance in eq.([relic ] ) .",
    "similar phenomenon occurs in the @xmath45 for dirac fermion dm , although it changes more mildly .",

    "the requirement of dark matter relic density as indicated by the right panel of fig.3 implies that perturbative analysis is not valid for fermion dm with mass roughly below 400 gev .",
    "conversely , this requirement as indicated by the left panel of fig.3 implies that perturbative analysis is not valid for scalar dm with mass roughly above 2.5 tev instead .    unlike the higgs - portal singlet dm model where dm - nucleon scattering proceeds via tree - level process , , in our model dm - nucleon scattering proceeds via a loop process instead",
