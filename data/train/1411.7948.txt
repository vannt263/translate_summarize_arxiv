    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , as one of a few quantum phenomena directly observable at a macroscopic scale , allow for detailed study of the relation between micro and macro worlds .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , a bec is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )  @xcite for the macroscopic wavefunction , which accounts for the external trap potential and for the inter - atomic interactions , the latter giving origin to the nonlinearity in the gpe .",
    "this is a conservative model which describes well many experimental setups if the losses are negligible .    in the meantime , in many practical situations , losses are naturally present and ( or ) can not be avoided . in particular ,",
    "inelastic light - atom interactions  @xcite and inelastic two- and three - body inter - atomic interactions  @xcite lead to linear and nonlinear dissipative terms in the meanfield description",
    ". emergent evolution of a bec in linear and nonlinear dissipative lattices was studies in  @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "one can consider condensates subjected to even stronger losses which , on the one hand can not be treated as a perturbation , and , on the other hand , appear to be a useful tool for controlling and manipulating the system .",
    "destruction of quantum states due to measurements , probing , or ionization by means of scattering are examples of sources of relatively strong losses .",
    "one of the consequences of the respective `` dissipative '' evolution of quantum states is their non - exponential decay , known since the pioneering works  @xcite , and even total suppression of the decay under continuous measurement  @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon is known as the _ quantum zeno effect _ ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time , the quantum zeno effect was observed experimentally in vapors of beryllium atoms  @xcite . in subsequent experimental studies ,",
    "the phenomenon was observed by measuring escape of cold atoms loaded in an accelerating optical lattice  @xcite , exploring atomic spin motion controlled by circularly polarized light  @xcite , studying an externally driven mixture of two hyperfine states of a @xmath0rb bec  @xcite , and inducing production of cold molecular gases in an optical lattice  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum zeno effect has also received considerable attention in theoretical works  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested in  @xcite that macroscopic ( phenomenological ) analog of the zeno effect can be addressed using a mean - field model of a bec in a double - well trap with removal of atoms from one of the potential wells .",
    "comparison of the quantum simulations with the respective gpes with a dissipative term has shown very good agreement , which immediately suggested that the phenomenon can be observed in a wider class of physical systems , such as , for instance , optical waveguides with kerr nonlinearity  @xcite , whose dynamics is described by the equations fully analogous to the gpe with a double - well trap . such a macroscopic manifestation of the phenomenon is referred to as the _ macroscopic zeno effect_. the macroscopic zeno effect is particularly well adjusted for some experimental setting , such as probing of a bec with an electron beam  @xcite , where the condensed atoms are eliminated through the ionization resulting from electron - atom collisions .",
    "the macroscopic zeno effect manifests itself in a nonmonotonic dependency of the atomic losses on the beam intensity ( i.e. on the effective dissipation in terms of the mean - field approximation ) .",
    "very recently , the macroscopic zeno effect was observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics in the presence of a localized defect is discussed already for many years ; see e.g.  @xcite where interaction of kinks of the driven long josephson junction with a dissipative defect in a form of dirac delta was considered",
    ". turning to the effect of localized dissipative defects on the evolution of a bec reveals numerous striking phenomena . among them",
    "we mention a possibility of manipulating the condensate ( say performing switching and phase locking )  @xcite or excitation of different macroscopic patterns in the condensates  @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that a strong enough dissipation can support quasi - stationary patterns  @xcite and stationary currents  @xcite which depend on the intensity and the width of the electron beam in a very nontrivial ( nonmonotonic ) way . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the macroscopic zeno effect can be observed not only in real space , but also in the fourier one : a periodic dissipation ( dissipative lattice ) applied to a condensate allows for generating nondecaying bloch states ( see also @xcite ) .    most of the previous studies and , in particular , the theory of the macroscopic zeno effect developed in  @xcite , however , dealt with quasi - one - dimensional settings .",
    "analysis of the phenomenon in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) setting is the main goal of this work . more specifically , we will show that a narrow 2d dissipation can generate stable stationary nonlinear flows which bear either zero or non - zero topological charge ( vorticity ) .",
    "such modes exists due to compensation of the dissipative losses by the incoming flux ( in this context we mention a recent for  @xcite where similar mechanism resulted in stationary 2d vortex light beams in a cubic - quintic medium with homogeneous nonlinear dissipation were reported ) .",
    "we also show that the current density of the stationary flows depends on the strength of the dissipation in the nonmonotonous way , which is a manifestation of the macroscopic zeno effect .",
    "we describe the 2d macroscopic zeno effect effect using a model which governs the macroscopic ( meanfield ) dynamics of a pancake - shaped bec with a positive scattering length @xmath1 ( say , of @xmath0rb atoms ) , subjected to a narrow electronic beam similar to the setting of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the model where the beam radius is of order of @xmath2  nm while the radial dimension of the trap is @xmath3 m ( @xmath4  hz ) . in this situation",
    ", @xmath5 and one can explore the model of a narrow dissipative defect .",
    "to this end , we use the 2d gpe @xcite @xmath6 in the dimensionless variables @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we keep the nonlinear coefficient @xmath10 as a free parameter for the sake of convenience ; alternatively , it can be scaled out by rescaling the amplitude of the wavefunction .",
    "the function @xmath11 describes effect of the external dissipation .    generally speaking , the macroscopic zeno effect is understood as a suppression of atomic losses subject to increasing strength of dissipation .",
    "if there is no pump of the atoms into condensate , then the bec looses the atoms with the rate @xmath12 where @xmath13 in the number of atoms in the bec , and the macroscopic zeno effect manifests itself in decrease of the decay rate as the intensity of the localized dissipation grows . in this statement ,",
    "the effect was observed experimentally  @xcite .    in our present study",
    ", we pose a slightly different problem .",
    "we consider an idealized situation when the dissipation , localized at @xmath14 , is applied to an infinite sample of the bec ( i.e. number of atoms @xmath15 is infinite ) .",
    "then the dissipation induces a particle current directed from infinity towards the center , i.e. towards the dissipative defect .",
    "the density of the inward current can be adjusted to compensate exactly effect of the losses , which means that the condensate enters a stationary regime , i.e. the density distribution of the bec and the density of the current do not depend on time @xmath16 . in",
    "what follows , such structures are referred to as stationary flows .",
    "it is clear that the inward current density of the stationary flow , generally speaking , depends on the strength of the dissipation .",
    "then the macroscopic zeno effect , if exists , will manifest itself through a nonmonotonous dependence of the current density on the strength of dissipation .",
    "such a statement of the problem is justified by the fact that the rate of atomic losses is proportional to the current density towards the defect necessary to compensate losses and to ensure stationary flows .",
    "in order to formalize the statement of the problem , we rewrite the gp - equations in the hydrodynamic form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the local density , @xmath19 is the superfluid velocity , and @xmath20 is the phase of the macroscopic wavefunction .    in what follows the consideration",
    "will be reduced to the radially symmetric dissipative defect , i.e. we consider @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) .",
    "moreover we consider dissipation having a finite support , i.e. @xmath23 and centered at @xmath14 ( this form of the dissipative term models , in particular , the electronic beam used in  @xcite ) . respectively , @xmath24 will be referred to as a width of the dissipation defect .",
    "then the strength of the dissipation is proportional either to the maximal amplitude @xmath25 of the dissipation ( in our case @xmath26 ) or to the width @xmath24 .",
    "radially symmetric dissipation allows us to look for two - dimensional radially symmetric stationary vortex solutions of gp equation ( [ gpe ] ) for which @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the azimuthal coordinate , the integer @xmath30 characterizing the topological charge ( vorticity ) of the stationary flow , and @xmath31 being the chemical potential , i.e. @xmath32 we also introduce the radial component of the superfluid velocity @xmath33 and note that the chemical potential is given as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . then substituting the expression ( [ statflow ] ) into the gpe ( [ gpe ] ) , we obtain the following system of two equations : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the radial current density which is necessary to compensate the losses induced by the dissipative term @xmath38 .",
    "we are interested in solutions ( [ statflow ] ) that correspond to stationary flows directed from infinity towards the center @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that the atomic density @xmath40 is uniform at infinity , i.e. @xmath40 approaches a fixed constant @xmath41 as @xmath42 . without loss of generality , in what follows we consider @xmath43",
    "( other values of @xmath41 can be addressed by means of rescaling the nonlinear coefficient @xmath44 ) . since @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the density of the radial",
    "inward current @xmath47 is constant for large @xmath48 : @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "then for any stationary flow the chemical potential is fixed as @xmath51 .    for any stationary state ,",
    "the current density @xmath52 is such that the inward flow compensates exactly the effect of the losses @xmath53 .",
    "hence we conclude that the macroscopic zeno effect ( if any ) manifests itself in a nonmonotonous dependence of @xmath52 on the amplitude @xmath25 or on the width @xmath24 of the dissipation .",
    "since @xmath53 is zero outside of the bounded domain @xmath54 , one finds that at @xmath55 the limiting value of the density is approached algebraically ( notice that in the 1d case the respective asymptotic is exponential  @xcite ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "behavior of the radial velocity as @xmath58 can be described as @xmath59 respectively , as @xmath55 , the behavior of argument @xmath60 of the stationary wavefunction @xmath61 is logarithmic in the leading order : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .    turning to behavior of the solutions in the vicinity of the origin , i.e. in the limit @xmath64",
    ", we show that if the topological charge is zero , i.e. if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , let us make the most general assumption that in the leading order @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , so far , arbitrary constants .",
    "then , from ( [ eq : odesysb ] ) in the leading order we obtain @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 . substituting the obtained asymptotic for @xmath75 in ( [ eq : odesysa ] ) , and requiring @xmath70 to be different from zero ,",
    "we obtain in the leading order that the three terms in ( [ eq : odesysa ] ) are respectively of order of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these terms can not cancel each other in the limit @xmath64 , i.e. the assumption about nonzero @xmath70 is contradictory , and in the leading order @xmath79 at @xmath80 .",
    "for nonzero topological charge , @xmath81 , the asymptotic at @xmath64 reads @xmath82 , which is typical for vortex - like solutions .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing that chosen dissipation is smooth but has a _",
    "finite _ support @xmath83 . to understand that the width of the defect @xmath24 is a relevant parameter ( for the 1d case this is was shown in  @xcite ) for the observation of the zeno effect , let us consider a stationary solutions @xmath84 . integrating ( [ hydro1 ] ) over a disc domain , of the radius @xmath24 , covering the defect region ,",
    "we obtain @xmath85 now from the green s divergence theorem we compute ( recall the definition ( [ j ] ) ) @xmath86 ( recall that @xmath75 is the radial component of the velocity and we consider radially symmetric solutions @xmath40 and @xmath87 ) . since we assumed that the dissipation has a finite support , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fin_support ] ) , we have that @xmath88 . thus ,",
    "if @xmath40 is not `` too '' singular function at @xmath39 , i.e. is bounded in the limit @xmath64 , in the leading order we have that in the limit @xmath89 @xmath90 in other words @xmath91 is proportional to the integral strength of the dissipation @xmath92 and it monotonously grows with @xmath25 ( or @xmath24 ) at fixed @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) meaning that in the limit @xmath93 one can not observe the macroscopic zeno effect .",
    "formula ( [ limit ] ) reveals also that @xmath94 at @xmath95 and @xmath24 fixed , and @xmath96 at @xmath89 and @xmath25 fixed .",
    "these types of behavior we will observe in fig .  [ fig - j(g)m=0 ] below ( the upper and lower lines ) .",
    "for numerical study of stationary flows we choose the dissipation in the form @xmath97 then @xmath53 is a smooth function with finite support .    since experimental verification of the predicted effects would be only possible using stable stationary currents , for all the results reported below we tested the linear stability of the respective solution . to this end",

    "moreover , we observed that the stationary flows feature attractor - like behavior , that is they can be obtained starting from a fairly general class of initial conditions .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - dyn ] where the initial conditions with uniform density ( @xmath120 ) undergo a sufficiently long transient process ( see e.g. panels with @xmath121 ) and eventually form a doubly - charged stationary flow ( @xmath122 ) . the resulting vorticity ( @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig - dyn ] ) is determined by the boundary conditions which are chosen to `` swirl '' the condensate .",
    "the boundary conditions also fix the density of the condensate at the infinity ( @xmath123 ) , but do not prescribe any specific value of the flux @xmath52 incoming from the infinity .",

    "to conclude , we have reported the existence of the macroscopic zeno effect in a two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate subjected to a radially symmetric localized dissipation .",
    "the effect manifests itself in a non - monotonic dependence of the superfluid current density , necessary for supporting stable stationary flows , on the strength of the dissipation .",
    "when the latter is relatively small , its increase results in increase of the current density .",
    "however , after a certain threshold value further increase of the strength of the dissipation requires lower currents necessary to compensate the losses .",
    "the phenomenon is originated by a dissipation , which must have sufficiently strong localization ( or even finite support , as in our case ) but nonzero width ( no zeno effect can be observed for a point - like dissipation ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effect can be observed for solutions that bear either zero or nonzero topological charge . in the latter case ,",
    "the solutions represent stationary vortex flows .",
    "we found that such solutions are dynamically stable , either for single or multiple topological charge .",
    "our study was focused on an application to an atomic bose - einstein condensate . in the meantime",
