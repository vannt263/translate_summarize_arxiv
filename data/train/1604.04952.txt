    "we call the sequence @xmath22 , where @xmath23 a * free spectrahedron * ( or a * free lmi domain * ) .",
    "free spectrahedra arise naturally in many systems engineering problems described by a signal flow diagram @xcite .",
    "they are also canonical examples of matrix convex sets @xcite and thus are intimately connected to the theory of completely positive maps and operator systems and spaces @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study bianalytic maps @xmath4 between free spectrahedra . our belief , supported by the results in this paper and our experience with free spectrahedra",
    "( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) , is that the existence of bianalytic maps imposes rigid , but elegant , structure on both the free spectrahedra as well as the map @xmath4 .",
    "motivation for this study comes from several sources .",
    "free analysis , including free analytic functions is a recent development @xcite with close ties to free probability @xcite and quantum information theory @xcite . in engineering systems",
    "theory , certain model problems can be described by a system of matrix inequalities . for optimization and design purposes ,",
    "it is hoped that these inequalities have a convex solution set . in this case , under a boundedness hypothesis , the solution set is a free spectrahedron @xcite . if the domain is not convex one might replace it by its matrix convex hull @xcite or map it bianalytically to a free spectrahedron .",
    "two such maps then lead to a bianalytic map between free spectrahedra .    studying bianalytic maps between free spectrahedra is a free analog of rigidity problems in several complex variables @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a large literature on bianalytic maps on convex sets .",
    "for instance , faran @xcite showed that any proper analytic map from the unit ball in @xmath24 to the unit ball in @xmath25 with @xmath26 that is real analytic up to the boundary , is ( up to automorphisms of the domain and codomain ) the standard linear embedding @xmath27 .",
    "however , when @xmath28 , huang and ji @xcite proved this map and the whitney map @xmath29 are the only such maps .",
    "forstneri @xcite showed that any proper analytic map between balls with sufficient regularity at the boundary must be rational .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further recent developments .",
    "the remainder of this introduction is organized as follows .",
    "basic terminology and background appear in subsection [ sec : basic ] . a novel family of maps we call convexotonicmaps and which we believe comprise , up to affine linear equivalence , exactly the bianalytic maps between free spectrahedra , is described in subsection [ sec : ct ] .",

    "we also record @xmath1569 or equivalently @xmath1570 .",
    "turning to equation , @xmath1571 hence , @xmath1572 taking determinants in the second of these equations gives @xmath1573 and therefore @xmath1574 is real .",
    "taking determinants in the third and fourth equations gives @xmath1575 .",
    "thus , @xmath1576 in particular , @xmath1577    multiplying the third equation on the left by the fourth equation gives @xmath1578 using the second equation @xmath1579 since @xmath1580 and @xmath1581 are invertible , @xmath1582 in particular , @xmath1583 is a multiple of a unitary .",
    "next multiply the fourth equation by its adjoint on the right to obtain @xmath1584 multiplying the third equation by its adjoint on the left gives ( as @xmath1585 ) @xmath1586    in view of equation , if @xmath1587 , then @xmath1588 and if @xmath1589 , then @xmath1590 .",
    "hence , with @xmath1591 and @xmath1592 either @xmath1587 and @xmath1593 or @xmath1589 and @xmath1594 we will argue that this second case does not occur .",
    "recall we are assuming @xmath1595 and @xmath1596 are both invertible .",
    "this implies @xmath1129 is invertible .",
    "observe that , assuming this second set of equations , for complex numbers @xmath1597 , @xmath1598    by assumption there is a @xmath1599 such that @xmath1600 is not invertible but @xmath1601 is invertible which leads to the contradiction that the left hand side of equation is invertible , but the right hand side is not .",
    "it follows that @xmath1587 and @xmath1602    assuming @xmath1603 is linearly independent , this set spans the @xmath1383 matrices .",
    "hence , by lemma [ lem : reduce ] , @xmath1604 for some @xmath331 with @xmath1605 .",
    "hence many of the identities in equation now imply that @xmath1583 is also a multiple of the identity .",
    "for instance , using the third equality , @xmath1606 and hence @xmath1607 .",
    "thus , @xmath1608 and consequently @xmath1609 it follows that @xmath1610 on the other hand , @xmath1611 it follows that , @xmath1612 note that combining the first two of these equations gives , @xmath1613 since @xmath1604 , the last equality in equation gives @xmath1614 it follows , using the second equality in equation , @xmath1615 simplifying with @xmath1421 and bringing to one side gives @xmath1616    we now proceed to prove item .",
    "assuming @xmath1617 is linearly independent , equation and the fact that @xmath1562 yields @xmath1618",
    ". so @xmath1619 and @xmath1620 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1621 , implies @xmath1622 .",
    "hence @xmath1623 , @xmath1624 and @xmath1625 it also follows that @xmath1626 by the third equation in . furthermore , @xmath1627 so @xmath1628 , as @xmath1629 is linearly independent .",
    "hence @xmath1630 and @xmath1631 finally , @xmath1632 also implies @xmath1633 thus , @xmath1634 and @xmath1635 , @xmath1482 and finally , @xmath1636 too .",
    "hence , @xmath1637 and the proof of item is complete .    moving on to item , assume now @xmath1638 if @xmath1639 then @xmath1617 must also be linearly independent , and hence the conclusions of item hold .    to complete the proof of the theorem ,",
    "suppose @xmath1640 and recall equation , @xmath1641 since @xmath1642 is linearly independent , @xmath1643 it follows that @xmath1488 and @xmath1644 now , using equation and looking at the third equation in equation , @xmath1645 using @xmath1646 , @xmath1647 using equation , @xmath1648 let @xmath1649 , solving for the @xmath207 and @xmath1650 terms , equation becomes @xmath1651 write @xmath1652 , let @xmath1653 with @xmath1654 and consider @xmath1655 but @xmath1656 , so @xmath1657 for all @xmath1298 with @xmath1654 which contradicts @xmath1461 being bounded .",
    "hence both @xmath1658 and @xmath1659 .",
    "so either @xmath1660 or @xmath1661 .",
    "however @xmath1662 while @xmath1663 , hence this second equality never holds . thus @xmath1660 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1664 , so @xmath1665 and @xmath1666 recall , @xmath1667 so plugging in ; @xmath1668 and @xmath1669    next , we know that @xmath1670 and @xmath1671 , so yet again plugging in ; @xmath1672 using the fact that @xmath1673 @xmath1674 recall however , that @xmath1675 , so taking a unimodular @xmath1676 and then setting @xmath1677 , @xmath1678 @xmath1679 which by construction is an automorphism of @xmath1 . moreover , if @xmath1680 is another unimodular , then @xmath1681    these automorphisms must be the only automorphisms of @xmath1 , since if there were some other form of automorphism then by composing with @xmath107 we would get a different form for a bianalytic polynomial from @xmath1 to @xmath1 which can not happen .    99    j. agler , j. mccarthy : _ global holomorphic functions in several non - commuting variables _ , canad . j. math . 67 ( 2015 ) 241285 .",
