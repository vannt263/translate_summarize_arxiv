    "the study of classical and quantum dynamical systems of a few degrees of freedom coupled to an environment containing many continues to attract considerable attention for various reasons .",
    "first of all , such studies shed light on fundamental issues of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , such as return to equilibrium , the emergence of irreversibility and the existence of stationary non - equilibrium states .",
    "more generally , they arise in the rigorous derivation of macroscopic transport laws ( such as ohm s law and fourier s law ) and of reduced equations of motion ( e.g. , langevin equations and master equations ) from a microscopic , hamiltonian description of the dynamics .",
    "the explicit computation of transport coefficients such as the diffusion constant or the mobility from first principles is another motivation of such studies , particularly in solid state physics .",
    "it is this problem that interests us here .",
    "the case in which the environmental variables to which the particle couples are _ vibrational _ degrees of freedom is of obvious interest to many fields of physics and is the most amenable to both analytical and numerical studies .",
    "the model hamiltonian we will study in this paper was introduced in @xcite and can be written @xmath6here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the particle position and momentum and @xmath9 are the position and momentum of an oscillator of frequency @xmath10 located at @xmath11 with which the particle interacts provided @xmath12 ; indeed , @xmath13 vanishes when @xmath14 and equals unity otherwise ( we take @xmath15 ) . here",
    "@xmath16 is a driving field and we are interested in computing the low field mobility of the particle as a function of the temperature of the oscillator bath .",
    "our motivation for studying this particular model is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "the model obviously resembles those describing electron - phonon interactions in solids @xcite , an analogy that is further worked out in @xcite .",
    "alternatively it can be viewed as describing the motion of a particle in an inelastic one - dimensional lorentz gas .",
    "recall that in the usual lorentz gas , a popular model for the study of transport properties , a particle moves on a two - dimensional plane on which circular hard scatterers are randomly or periodically placed . in order to describe the interaction with a thermal environment",
    ", the scatterers can be allowed to rotate , as in @xcite , yielding a model similar to ours but with the environment described through rotational degrees of freedom rather than vibrational ones .",
    "alternatively , the scatterers can be kept fixed , as in @xcite , while the environmental interaction is phenomenologically described through the use of a gaussian thermostat ; in the latter situation only the particle degrees of freedom remain dynamical and the system is no longer hamiltonian .",
    "our model can be viewed as a one - dimensional hamiltonian version of such models . unlike previously studied two - dimensional transport models , however , the present model is not homogeneous in energy ; as a result it displays a wide range of microscopic behavior that varies with the temperature of the system .",
    "the main conclusion of the paper regarding the present model is that , provided the driving field @xmath0 is low enough , the particle distribution quickly acquires a drift velocity @xmath17 proportional to the driving field @xmath0 which it then maintains over times that are exponentially long in @xmath18 this current is _ metastable _",
    ", however , due to a runaway phenomenon that arises because oscillator lattices , in general , do not efficiently slow down very fast particles ( see section  [ s : runaway ] ) . thus , this system does not approach a stationary non - equilibrium state .",
    "we nevertheless show that the associated mobility is well - defined and related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the diffusion constant @xmath3 and the inverse temperature @xmath19 through einstein s relation @xmath20 thus , in this simple fully hamiltonian model , the particle exhibits normal transport behavior obeying ohm s law at low fields .    these conclusions will be surprising to some , since previous studies of similar models seem to indicate rather strongly that coupling to a _",
    "monochromatic _ bath would be expected to lead to anomalous particle transport . to support this claim",
    "we conclude this introduction with a short overview of the relevant literature .",
    "there is a considerable body of work on a variety of models in which a particle of momentum @xmath8 and position @xmath7 couples linearly to the displacements or momenta of a heat bath of oscillators .",
    "a very general class of such models was proposed in @xcite . to describe the results in the literature relevant to our work here it will be sufficient to consider a specific subclass of models described by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath21 here @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the displacement and momentum of an oscillator of frequency @xmath25 , which should be thought of as finding itself at the point @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is to be thought of solely as an index for the oscillators . as a result , the collection of oscillators @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 being fixed , represent a bath of vibrational degrees of freedom of the medium at the point @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore @xmath30 and @xmath31 are measures ( on @xmath3 and @xmath32 respectively ) and @xmath33 positive functions determining the coupling of the oscillators to the particle . note that , since neither @xmath34 nor @xmath35 depend on @xmath29 , the oscillator baths have the same characteristics at all points @xmath26",
    ". we will choose for @xmath13 a compactly supported positive function centered at the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ clashol ] ) is of the above type , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "previously studied models with hamiltonians as in ( [ generalh ] ) are of two types .",
    "models with a continuous distribution of oscillators uniformly throughout all of space are studied in @xcite ; in that case @xmath38 and @xmath39 . alternatively , in @xcite , the oscillators are located at a countable set of points @xmath40 chosen randomly and homogeneously throughout space so that @xmath41    to discuss the results obtained in those previous studies we introduce the coupling weighted spectral density of the system , defined as @xmath42 where the spectral density @xmath43 is defined via @xmath44 in @xcite , the distribution of frequencies is supposed to be continuous and @xmath45 as @xmath46 , for some @xmath47 .",
    "it is then argued in @xcite that normal transport properties are obtained in such models only if @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , these authors argue that when @xmath49 , particle motion is diffusive provided @xmath48 , whereas anomalous diffusion occurs otherwise .",
    "similar results are obtained rigorously in @xcite where it is proven that in the fully translationally invariant models considered ( namely @xmath38 ) a particle moving at constant speed @xmath50 through an oscillator bath at zero temperature experiences a friction force proportional to @xmath51 at low @xmath50 : this again indicates that a finite mobility will be obtained only if @xmath48 , a fact rigorously proven in @xcite for the model considered , at zero temperature .",
    "similar conclusions have been obtained in the much more numerous studies ( @xcite and references therein ) dealing with a simpler but related class of models in which the potential @xmath52 is chosen to be confining .",
    "note that this prevents the particle from making arbitrarily large excursions from equilibrium , justifying a `` dipole approximation '' in the hamiltonian ( [ generalh ] ) in which the coupling is linear in @xmath7 as well .",
    "after some rewriting , the resulting bilinearly coupled hamiltonian takes the form@xmath53and is then much simpler to analyze . in classical systems , for example , it straightforwardly leads to a generalized langevin equation for the particle : @xmath54 with @xmath55 q^2\\ ] ] and where @xmath56 is the retarded friction kernel and @xmath57 \\sigma_2(\\xi)\\ \\d\\xi\\ ] ] the random force exerted by the medium on the particle , which depends on the initial conditions for the particle ( @xmath58 ) and for the bath variables ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "return to equilibrium for such systems was shown for general confining potentials in @xcite provided @xmath60 ; the particular case @xmath48 , with a harmonic potential @xmath61 was treated in @xcite .",
    "note furthermore that the same model , with @xmath49 can also be understood as a model for a non - confined particle : in that case the oscillator degrees of freedom can be thought of as internal degrees of freedom of a composite particle , rather than as environmental degrees of freedom . for this model ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the particle diffuses only in the ohmic case @xmath48 and is superdiffusive ( respectively subdiffusive ) when @xmath62 ( respectively @xmath63 ) .    in short , in all existing literature",
    "in which theoretical results are available on the behavior of a particle coupled ( linearly or not ) to vibrational degrees of freedom , normal transport properties for the particle occur only if the oscillator bath has a continuous oscillator spectrum with a sufficient density of low frequency modes ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "our study here shows that while an ohmic local bath is certainly a sufficient condition for normal transport , it is not a necessary one . on the contrary , we show that even with a monochromatic oscillator bath having no low frequency modes , a finite diffusion constant and well behaved low field mobility can be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : mobnum ] we describe our numerical results on the particle mobility and its temperature dependence .",
    "section  [ s : hightempmob ] provides an explanation of the high temperature part of our data in terms of a random walk model motivated by the underlying physics of the hamiltonian dynamics . in section  [ s : linearresponse ]",
    "we apply linear response theory to prove an einstein relation for the model , valid at all temperatures , which we apply to explain the low temperature behaviour of the model . in section  [",

    ", it encounters a potential energy step @xmath78 of magnitude @xmath79 and it therefore either turns back or proceeds with a change in momentum that is simply determined by energy conservation .",

    "we are concerned both with the high and the low temperature regime . to understand what this means , note that there are two mechanical energy scales associated with this model .",
    "the first one is the binding energy @xmath87 , which is the classical ground state energy of the system , obtained when the particle is at rest in one interaction region ( for example the one associated with the oscillator at @xmath88 ) , with the corresponding oscillator in its displaced equilibrium position and all other oscillators at rest ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the other one is the kinetic energy @xmath90 of a particle that crosses the interaction region of length @xmath91 in one oscillator period . along with the thermal energy @xmath92 , this allows the introduction of two energy related dimensionless parameters , which we denote by @xmath93 the model also has two length scales @xmath94 and @xmath95 , leading to a third dimensionless parameter @xmath96 by high temperatures we will mean the regime @xmath97 , for which the average thermal energy of the particle is ( much ) higher than both the binding energy @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the low temperature regime , these inequalities are reversed . as we will show below , the temperature dependence of the mobility is in this model qualitatively different in these two different regimes , due to the qualitatively different nature of the microscopic dynamics .     for several sets of parameters , temperatures , and forces ( @xmath100 ) . in both panel ( a ) ( where @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) and panel ( c ) ( where @xmath67 , @xmath66 ) triangles indicate @xmath68 and circles @xmath69 in both panel ( b ) ( where @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and panel ( d ) ( where @xmath72 , @xmath71 ) , diamonds indicate @xmath68 and squares @xmath73 .",

    "the mobility is shown for six different temperatures .",
    "the straight line corresponds to @xmath119 with @xmath120.[muhight],height=288 ]    at low temperatures , the numerics is complicated by the following phenomenon .",
    "first , since we compute displacements and since the system is periodic , we can start all particles in the cell at @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 are the probabilities that the particle finds itself respectively in the interaction or in the non - interaction region of the cell @xcite .",
    "note that , obviously , the latter is exponentially less likely as the temperature is lowered .",
    "in addition , only an exponentially small fraction of the particles in the interaction region will ever leave the first cell under the dynamics , because most particles will never manage to overcome the typical energy barriers they meet at the edges .",
    "this leads to an exponential suppression of the mobility at low temperatures that can be observed both on fig .",
    "[ muhight ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mulowt ] and that will be further explained in section [ s : linearresponse ] .",
    "these phenomena also affect the numerics in the following way : trapped particles will of course not contribute to the mobility and running the corresponding trajectories would be a waste of computer time .",
    "it would also keep one from getting good enough statistics , especially at low temperatures , where the drift speed is low .",
    "fortunately , using the analysis of @xcite , it is possible to predict _ a priori _ from the initial conditions of the particle and the oscillator if the particle will ever get out , and implementing this in the program allows one to avoid running the corresponding trajectories uselessly .",
    "it follows from this analysis that particles can remain trapped only if they start in an interaction region .",
    "suppose therefore @xmath123 are the initial data for the particle , with @xmath124 so that the particle is indeed in the interaction region , and let @xmath125 be the initial conditions for the oscillator in the cell at the origin .",
    "the total energy of this particle - oscillator system can then be written @xmath126 where @xmath127 analyzing the particle - oscillator dynamics along the lines of @xcite the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the particle will leave the cell at the origin at some point in the future are @xmath128    we now turn in the next sections to the theoretical explanation of the observed numerical data described here and in particular of the temperature dependence of the computed mobilities observed in fig .",
    "[ muhight ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mulowt ] .",
    "in order to explain theoretically the high temperature part of the numerical results described in the previous section , we will further develop the simplified random walk model of the fully hamiltonian dynamics at high temperature that was developed in @xcite for the case @xmath129 .",
    "this will provide us with a clear and simple physical picture of the motion of the particle in this regime . first note",
    "that , at high @xmath130 , the typical kinetic energy of a particle ( which is of order @xmath131 ) is much higher than the typical barriers it encounters ( which are of order @xmath132 ) . as a result , particles drawn from a thermal distribution tend to enter most interaction regions they encounter , rather than reflecting .",
    "now any particle with a high velocity @xmath50 will cross the interaction region in a time @xmath133 which is short compared to the oscillator period and as a result it will tend to lose an energy @xmath134 to the oscillator , as shown in @xcite . at high temperatures",
    ", one has @xmath135 and a particle with approximate thermal speed will satisfy the above condition since @xmath136 so that @xmath137 is equivalent to @xmath138 .    on the other hand , the same particle gains or loses an energy @xmath139 from the field while traversing the cell , depending on whether it is moving to the right or to the left .",
    "consequently , if the field is too large , @xmath140 , particles with thermal speed moving to the right will be accelerated indefinitely , so that it is not possible for a drift speed to be set up in the system . at small fields , on the other hand @xmath141 such particles",
    "will lose a net energy .",
    "the resulting average velocity change upon traversal of one cell is given by @xmath142so , when the temperature is high and the field small , the energy loss experienced by most particles in the thermal distribution is small , and they traverse many cells before slowing down to a point where their kinetic energy is smaller than or comparable to the typical barrier heights .",
    "at that point , they can be expected to receive a randomizing `` kick '' from one of the oscillators .",
    "we will assume that this randomizing `` kick '' reinstates a thermal distribution for the particles .",
    "one easily finds the distance @xmath143 over which a particle of high initial velocity @xmath50 travels before slowing down , as well as the characteristic time @xmath144 of the slowing down process , by integrating ( [ deltav ] ) : @xmath145 and @xmath146 this yields : @xmath147and @xmath148 , \\qquad \\ell \\left ( v\\right ) = \\frac{3}{4}v\\tau \\left ( v\\right).\\]]note that , as expected , for @xmath149 , one has @xmath150 : particles moving to the right are pushed on by the field and therefore travel further before slowing down .",
    "the result of this analysis is that at high temperatures one can view the particle motion as a biased random walk with steps @xmath143 and waiting times @xmath144 , with @xmath50 drawn after each randomizing kick from the boltzmann distribution @xmath151 .",
    "this picture therefore leads one to predict an average drift velocity@xmath152 and thus a mobility@xmath153the data presented in fig .",
    "[ muhight ] show that this simple picture of the dynamics yields the correct temperature behaviour of the mobility at high temperatures as well as a reasonable estimate of the prefactor .",

    "[ muhight ] , emphasizing the low temperature data .",
    "the curve corresponds to @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "this clearly brings out both the exponential dependence at low temperatures and the power law dependence at high temperatures .",
    "[ fig : mulowt],height=226 ]",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the physics underlying the low - temperature dynamics of the model at zero field ( @xmath129 ) is of a very different nature than the one at high temperatures .",
    "it can again be described in terms of a random walk but this time with _ nearest - neighbour _ hopping of the particle .",
    "the analysis of @xcite yields a very good prediction for the diffusion constant and its temperature dependence at low @xmath130 : @xmath157where@xmath158 in particular , it is seen from this result that the diffusion constant is thermally activated due to the self - trapping of the particle at low temperatures briefly explained in section [ s : mobnum ] ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this low temperature analysis is however more involved than the high - temperature one and will not be further adapted to the non - zero field situation we consider here .",
    "instead we will present in this section an alternative derivation of the mobility of the system and of its temperature dependence via kubo s linear response theory .",

    "but for all forces , at large enough times , the displacements increase faster than linearly with time.[fig : runaway1],height=226 ]    it is clear from ( [ deltav ] ) that , on average , particles with velocity @xmath195 gain more field energy than they dissipate , so that their mean velocity increases eventually as @xmath196 in addition , one may expect that even somewhat slower particles may , as a result of thermal fluctuations , see their speed increase beyond @xmath197 and then accelerate indefinitely .",

    "this breakdown time is of the order @xmath221 for the three largest forces used and is seen to increase with decreasing force .",
    "the numerically determined values of this breakdown time are plotted against the force @xmath218 in fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway2 ] .",
    "one notes that the breakdown time increases very fast with decreasing fields , in a manner qualitatively compatible with the exponential law derived above .",
    "indeed , the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : runaway2 ] corresponds to @xmath190 in ( [ eq : runawaytime ] ) with @xmath211 .",
    "this is compatible also with the following observation : for much lower forces , of the order of @xmath222 , the mean displacement of the particle increases linearly in time for the same system as seen in the circular data points of panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : drifts ] for times up to @xmath223 .",
    "this strongly indicates that for those very small forces , the breakdown time will be considerably larger than @xmath224 .",
    "the previous considerations make clear what the difficulties and practical limits are of the numerical computations on this model , specifically at high temperatures . indeed , because of the existence of the breakdown time",
    ", we have to use very small external forces to study the mobility ( see ( [ eq : smallforce ] ) ) .",
    "but then the drift will be small and so the motion is diffusion - dominated for quite long times .",
    "consequently , to observe the drift , one has to run many trajectories for long times in order to obtain sufficiently good statistics .",
    "the analysis of the runaway phenomenon allows for a closer study of the long time and low field limit of ( [ eq : mobfinitet ] ) .",
    "first , since this is a first order formula in @xmath0 , at fixed @xmath81 , and in view of ( [ eq : diffcst ] ) , it is clear that @xmath225 exists , with the two limits taken in that order . due to the runaway phenomenon exchanging the limits",
    "is not possible : one can not expect the limit as @xmath226 of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : mobfinitet ] ) to exist , for any fixed value of @xmath0 , however small .",
    "in other words , this model does not sustain a stationary state .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis also shows that the following precise mathematical statement can be expected to be true for this model : @xmath227 where the error term in @xmath0 is uniformly small for all times in the range @xmath228 in other words , the following limit should exist : @xmath229",
    "in conclusion , we have shown in this paper that an array of monochromatic oscillators at a positive temperature can serve as an effective heat bath for a particle driven through the lattice under the influence of an external driving field @xmath0 , inducing for the particle normal transport properties over very long times and distances and this in spite of the fact that a truly stationary state can not be sustained by the system .    to end , we point out that the situation here is therefore different from the one proven to hold for the lorentz gas with a gaussian thermostat @xcite . in that case a stationary state is shown to exist and the limits in ( [ eq : mobfinitet ] ) can be exchanged .",
    "but there , friction is provided by a gaussian thermostat and the model is therefore not fully hamiltonian , as pointed out before . on the other hand , in the lorentz gas with rotating scatterers @xcite ,",
    "the einstein relation is checked numerically to hold , but for rather short chains and times .",
    "finally , in @xcite we have argued that replacing the kinetic energy @xmath230 of the particle by a cosine band hamiltonian @xmath231 will suppress the runaway phenomenon , so that in that case as well a stationary state will exist .",
