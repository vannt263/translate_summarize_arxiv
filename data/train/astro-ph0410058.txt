    "gamma - ray universe in the energy band of 100  kev to 10 mev is a good observational window to study nucleosynthesis and particle acceleration in high energy astrophysical objects .",
    "however , in this energy band , observation sensitivity have been still limited , due to high background , difficulty in detecting photons , and incapability of imaging .",
    "a compton telescope tracking the compton scattering process of gamma - rays by position and energy sensitive detectors is difficult but a promising approach to bring a breakthrough in this energy band .    in the mev region ,",
    "comptel@xcite on - board _ cgro _ ( _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ) was the first successful compton telescope and brought many pioneering results@xcite . in a compton telescope , deposited energy and position of the gamma - ray interactions with the detector",
    "are acquired .",
    "when a gamma - ray photon is scattered in one detector and absorbed in another detector , the incident energy of the gamma - ray and the scattering angle can be determined as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy of the recoil electron , @xmath4 is the energy of the scattered photon and @xmath5 is the scattering angle .",
    "the latter equation presents the incident direction as a cone in the sky .    as shown in equation ( [ eq : comp ] ) , incident direction of a gamma - ray",
    "is calculated from the position and the energy information of interactions .",
    "therefore , employing semiconductor imaging spectrometers as components of compton telescopes , with their good energy and position resolution , will drastically improve the angular resolution and hence the sensitivity . in this point of view , advanced compton telescopes based on si , ge , czt and cdte are proposed and development is on - going in many groups@xcite .",
    "a compton telescope also enables us to measure polarization of gamma - rays , by obtaining the azimuthal distribution of compton scattering@xcite .",
    "based on our cdte and si detector technologies@xcite , we are working on a new si / cdte semiconductor compton telescope to explore the universe in the energy band from 100  kev to a few mev . in this paper , we describe experimental results obtained with a prototype compton telescope which consists of one layer of a double - sided si strip detector ( dssd ) and one layer of cdte pixel detectors .",
    "detailed performance of the dssd and the vision of next - generation gamma - ray missions using this technique are reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "demonstration of polarization detection are reported in mitani _",
    "et al._@xcite and tajima _",
    "basic concept of si / cdte compton telescope is to utilize si as a scatterer and cdte as an absorber@xcite .",
    "compared to compton telescopes using scintillator as an absorber , this design improves the performance especially at sub - mev region , as low as 100 kev .",
    "the lower energy coverage is prefered to connect the band pass of compton telescope with that of the technology using hard x - ray focusing mirror optics@xcite .",
    "a schematic image of si / cdte compton telescope is shown in figure [ fig : si_cdte_comp ] .",
    "the major interaction process of si with gamma - rays with energy higher than 60 kev is compton scattering , while in cdte photo - electric absorbtion is still dominant up to 300 kev ( figure [ fig : tau ] ) . in a si / cdte compton telescope , therefore , `` one - compton and absorption '' events dominate the data around several hundred kev .",
    "a merit of utilizing this kind of event is that it is relatively easy to analyze .",
    "for example , in compton scattering of photons with energy less than @xmath6  kev , the recoil electron energy is always less than that of the scattered photon@xcite .",
    "in addition , the ambiguity in the compton scattering angle caused by the orbital motion of bound electron is relatively small for si compared to that of ge and cdte .",
    "this effect is called `` doppler broadening effect@xcite '' , and is the dominant factor of angular resolution around a few hundered kev .",
    "the demerit of current si / cdte compton telescope design is that it looses effective area especially at the higher energy band , as much as a few mev .",
    "this is simply because the density of si ( @xmath7 ) is much less than that of cdte ( @xmath8 ) . for compton telescope",
    "aiming mainly at a few mev band , increasing the number and thickness of cdte layers becomes important .",
    "two key technologies for our si / cdte compton telescope are dssd and cdte pixel detectors . in this section ,",
    "we describe the detail of the newly developed @xmath9 cdte pixel detector and design of the prototype compton telescope .",
    "detail of the dssd development is described in fukazawa _",
    "et al._@xcite      the @xmath9 cdte pixel detector is based on the schottky cdte diode device , utilizing indium as the anode and platinum as the cathode . this device is developed with acrorad , japan and characterized by its low leakage current and high uniformity@xcite . figure  [ fig:8x8_photo ] ( left ) shows the photo of the detector .",
    "the detector has dimensions of @xmath10 and a thickness of @xmath11 .",
    "the indium side is used as a common electrode and the platinum side is divided into 8 by 8 pixels and a guard ring with a width of 1  mm .",
    "the guard - ring electrode are attached to reduce the leakage current of the side and corner pixels because most of the leakage current is through the detector perimeter@xcite .",
    "pixel size is @xmath12 , and the gap between each pixel is @xmath13 .",
    "each pixel is connected to a fanout board by bump bonding technology developed in cooperation with mitsubishi heavy industry , japan@xcite .",
    "since the leakage current of each pixel is as low as @xmath14 at a bias voltage of 500  v even at room temperature , the signal lines are directly connected to the input of readout electronics , an analog lsi va32ta@xcite .",
    "this lsi is developed with idea , norway , and characterized by its low noise .",
    "the lsis are read out via specially designed compact readout system including an adc and fpga , which is controlled with a fast serial interface `` space wire ( ieee 1355)''@xcite .",

    "first,``two - hit events '' , one hit in dssd and one hit in cdte , were selected from the raw data . here , one hit in dssd means that only one channel that is connected to dssd has a pulse hight above 6  kev , and one hit in cdte detectors means that only one channel that is connected to cdte detectors has a pulse hight above 20  kev .",
    "a scatter plot of the energy deposit at the dssd ( @xmath22 ) and at the cdte detectors ( @xmath23 ) is shown in figure  [ fig:2dim_plot ] .",
    "this plot is obtained when we irradiated @xmath15 to the compton telescope .",
    "there are branches which satisfies @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these branches are the events in which incident gamma - rays of 122  kev or136  kev are scattered in one detector and then absorbed in the other .",
    "another noticeable branches are those parallel to the horizontal axis around @xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "these are the events by the fuorescence x - rays from cd ( @xmath28 : 23.1  kev , @xmath29 : 26.1  kev ) and te ( @xmath28 : 27.4  kev , @xmath29 : 31.0  kev ) which escape from the cdte detectors and are absorbed in the dssd , and not the compton events .    for these `` two - hit events '' , we calculated the compton - scattering angle by using equation ( [ eq : comp ] ) . in the calculation , we assumed that incident gamma - rays are scattered in the dssd and absorbed in the cdte pixel detector . from the calculated scattering angle and the two hit positions ,",

    "[ fig : comp_image ] , appearance of each image is different .",
    "this reflects the basic process and geometry of the detector .",
    "for example , 81  kev image has a peculiar `` batterfly - like '' shape .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the scattering angle must be larger than @xmath33 to deposit an energy larger than 6  kev at the dssd , which is the energy threshold in this analysis , and that compton cones with peculiar orientation are obtained because the cdte detectors are offset from the dssd .",
    "another impressive image is obtained when we select the energy band of 100250  kev for @xmath21 irradiation data ( figure [ fig : comp_image](d ) ) .",
    "compared with line images ( figure [ fig : comp_image](b ) and ( c ) ) , the location of @xmath21 source is not clear .",
    "this is because the image is dominated by back scattered events and `` compton - compton '' events which finally escaped from the detector . from this data",

    "for example , @xmath38 at 81.0  kev and @xmath39 at 356  kev . in order to examine the reason of this tendency , we estimated the contribution of position and energy resolution of the dssd and the cdte detector .",
    "contribution of position resolution ( @xmath40 ) is estimated by using the actual hit positions obtained from the experiment and the strip / pixel size of the dssd and the cdte detector . to estimate the contribution of energy resolution ( @xmath41 ) , we used the compton - scattering angles of actual events and smoothed them with detector energy resolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : ein_dtheta ] , the estimated values are plotted . in the same figure , the values of @xmath42",
    "are also plotted .",

    "the tendency of @xmath43 is consistent with that of monte carlo simulations in several papers ( e.g. zoglauer and kanbach 2003@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath40 becomes smaller when the incident gamma - ray energy is smaller , because in such events only larger scattering angle and hence the longer distance events can be reconstructed due to the energy threshold for the dssd ( 6  kev ) .    in order to investigate the relation between the scattering angles and the angular resolution , we plotted the angular resolution against compton scattering angle from @xmath15 data in figure [ fig : theta_dtheta ] .",
    "the estimated value of uncertainty due to position resolution , energy resolution and doppler broadening are obtained in the same way as figure [ fig : ein_dtheta ] and plotted together .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is somewhat larger for larger scattering angles , and our analysis shows that this tendency is caused by doppler broadening . in other words , the contribution of doppler broadening can be reduced if we can reconstruct the events with smaller scattering angles , which means lower energy threshold for the dssd .     for 122  kev events . ]     for 122  kev events . ]",
