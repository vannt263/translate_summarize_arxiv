    "free - free emission from electron - ion interactions has well - determined spectral behavior but lacks an obvious template map : free - free emission never dominates the high - latitude radio sky , while other tracers of the warm ionized interstellar medium ( wim ) such as h@xmath1 emission , pulsar dispersion measure , or n ii emission are either incomplete , undersampled , or noise - dominated ( reynolds 1992 ; fixsen , bennett , & mather 1999 ) .",
    "the problem is particularly acute for free - free emission : lacking an accurate template for the spatial distribution , estimation of free - free emission in microwave data requires a pixel - by - pixel frequency decomposition which significantly reduces the signal to noise ratio of the desired cosmological signal .",

( 1996a , b ) proposed using infrared emission from diffuse cirrus as a tracer of the ionized gas responsible for free - free emission , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fluctuation in microwave antenna temperature from free - free emission , @xmath5 is the fluctuation in dust continuum intensity at wavelength 100 @xmath6 m , and the coefficient @xmath1 converts from units mjy / sr to @xmath6k antenna temperature .",

    "the detection of correlation between dust and ionized gas at high latitudes is consistent with the correlation observed between dust and free - free emission along the galactic plane ( broadbent , haslam , & osborne 1989 ) , and supports a picture in which free - free emission from the wim is traced by continuum emission from warm ( 19 k ) dust , with scaling @xmath15 between microwave emission @xmath4 and dust emission @xmath5 at 100 @xmath6 m wavelength .    a number of recent microwave observations show that the observed correlation between radio and far - ir emission is ubiquitous and not strongly dependent on angular scale .",

    "many experiments show microwave emission correlated with far - ir dust emission , with spectral index suggestive of free - free emission but lacking the strong h@xmath1 signal expected on physical grounds .",
    "if this is not free - free emission , what could it be ? recent work suggests that the `` anomalous '' microwave emission could originate from the electric dipole radiation of very small ( @xmath32 atoms ) spinning dust grains ( ferrara & dettmar 1994 ; draine & lazarian 1998a , b ) . a key feature of the spinning dust model is the microwave emission spectrum , which peaks between 10 and 50 ghz depending on the size distribution of the dust grains .",
    "figure [ dust_spectra ] shows a typical spectrum , with grain size ( @xmath33 atoms ) chosen to agree with the ovro detection at 14.5 ghz .",
    "identification of `` anomalous '' microwave emission as the signature of spinning dust has several advantages .",
    "it provides a natural explanation for the observed correlation between emission components at microwave and far - ir wavelengths : both components results from the _ same _ physical dust distribution and should be highly correlated at all angular scales .",
    "it explains the lack of a strong h@xmath1 signal without invoking energetically questionable gas temperature .",
    "finally , since the emission spectrum falls sharply at wavelengths below 10 ghz , it allows detectable `` anomalous '' signals in the window 30100 ghz without violating limits from radio surveys at 1420 and 408 mhz ( reich & reich 1988 , haslam et al .",
    "1981 ) .    the identification of `` anomalous '' microwave emission with spinning dust , while suggestive , is not without problems .",
    "the spectral index @xmath34 ( in antenna temperature ) of the calculated dust emission over the frequency range 1953 ghz where the most sensitive detections occur is between -3.3 and -4 , depending on the assumed size distribution of the dust grains ( draine & lazarian 1998b ) .",
    "such a steep spectral index lies 1.6 to 2.6 standard deviations from the best fitted index @xmath0 ( eq . [ beta_eq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , while long - wavelength limits are weak , there is as yet no confirmation of the predicted downturn at frequencies below 20 ghz .",
    "a large body of observational evidence demonstrates that at least one component of microwave emission is traced by far - ir dust emission .",
    "this correlation is ubiquitous on the sky and independent of angular scale . as such , the corresponding signal in microwave anisotropy maps",
    "can be removed by correlating independently each microwave frequency channel with a template dust map .",
    "the amplitude at microwave frequencies is small enough that residual uncertainties , after subtraction , should not be a major source of error for cosmological applications .",
    "the source of the correlated emission is still an open question with interesting astrophysical implications .",
    "the spectral index , within broad limits , is consistent at the 95% confidence level with either free - free emission or emission from spinning dust grains . from physical arguments",
    ", it seems likely that _ both _ emission mechanisms may contribute a detectable signal at microwave frequencies .",
    "both microwave and h@xmath1 emission are positively correlated with far - ir dust emission . assuming two separate emission mechanisms , microwave data contain contributions from both free - free and spinning dust , while h@xmath1 results trace only the free - free component .",
    "we may thus use the data in table [ chi_sq_table ] to obtain separate free - free and dust normalizations at 53 ghz . averaged over the full sky , emission from spinning dust",
    "is @xmath35 times as bright as free - free emission .",
    "substantial progress remains to be made in the identification of microwave foregrounds .",
    "a key discriminant between free - free and spinning dust models is the spectrum below 20 ghz where emission from spinning dust falls rapidly .",
    "a measurement of the correlated emission at a frequency below 10 ghz would provide a definitive test of the two models .",
    "astrophysical modelling of microwave emission as a probe of physical conditions in the interstellar medium requires a clean separation of individual emission components .",
    "current efforts along these lines are hampered by the lack of high signal - to - noise ratio maps at microwave , h@xmath1 , and far - ir frequencies in common regions of the sky .",
    "h@xmath1 maps from the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 ) , in combination with microwave data from the next generation balloon and satellite experiments , should allow a full set of microwave ",
    "h@xmath1dust correlations to separate emission from different phases of the ism .",
    "finally , sensitive microwave maps with substantial sky coverage will test for significant variation in the correlated emission from point to point on the sky . while there is no evidence for spatial variation in the correlation , existing full - sky data sets ( the cobe and 19 ghz maps ) are too noisy to test for variation in the correlation coefficient on angular scales below 60 .",
    "two of the three detections from small patches of sky ( ovro and max5 ) show appreciably larger correlations than the full - sky cobe results , but with substantial uncertainties .",
    "how anomalous are these anomalous results ? the map and planck satellite data should demonstrate whether full - sky average correlation is physically meaningful , or whether a more complicated model is required ."
