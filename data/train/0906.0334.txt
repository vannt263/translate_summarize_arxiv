    "magnetic reconnection allows a magnetized plasma system to convert magnetic energy into high speed flows and thermal energy , and is the main driving mechanism behind energetic phenomena such as solar flares , magnetospheric substorms , and tokamak sawteeth .",
    "a defining feature of these phenomena is that they are very bursty : in a substorm , for example , a significant fraction of the lobe magnetic flux is reconnected over a period of about 10 minutes , while the time between periodic substorms is roughly 2.75 hours @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of an x - class solar flare , the energy release may occur during several minutes or less in active regions that can last for weeks before reconnecting @xcite .",
    "a viable model of reconnection in such systems must therefore be consistent with the relatively long , quasi - stable periods in between reconnection bursts , as well as the rapidity of the energy release once a burst has somehow been triggered .    regarding the rapidity of reconnection , recent research ( see , @xmath2 , refs .",
    "@xcite ) has suggested that the reconnection process can indeed generate sufficiently fast rates of energy release to be consistent with observations provided that various conditions are met .",
    "for example , studies of spontaneous , unforced reconnection in systems with sufficiently narrow current sheets ( @xmath3 in the case without a guide magnetic field ) have found that the reconnection process becomes alfvnic - that is , the inflow velocity of plasma and magnetic flux into the reconnection region scales roughly like some fraction of the alfvn speed based on the upstream reconnecting component of the magnetic field . the narrowing of the current layer down to widths @xmath4 serves as a trigger point for the onset of fast reconnection in this case due to the important role played by non - ideal effects such as the hall term @xcite . without the addition of ad - hoc anomalous resistivity terms",
    ", simulations of systems with substantially thicker current sheets do not exhibit such fast reconnection behavior : at best the reconnection rates are throttled by the formation of long , narrow outflow layers as in the sweet - parker model , or in unfavorable magnetic geometries ( @xmath2 @xmath5  @xcite ) no spontaneous reconnection may take place at all .",
    "the fact that reconnection can occur very rapidly or not at all is consistent with the burstyness of the reconnection phenomena discussed earlier provided one can explain how a system can transition from a quasi - stable phase ( characterized , for example , by a relatively thick current sheet ) to a period of fast reconnection ( a narrow current sheet ) .",
    "one possible mechanism to explain this transition is explored in this paper : to externally force a stable , thick current sheet system so that the magnetic flux and electric current are compressed in a localized region down to the small scales @xmath4 at which non - ideal effects such as the hall term become important .",
    "this compression is generated in our simulations by a spatially localized external forcing term that is added to the ion momentum equation inside a three - dimensional ( 3d ) computational domain .",
    "this method allows the scaling of the reconnection rate in 3d to be studied over a wide dynamic range : by changing the level of forcing , our simulations achieve more than an order of magnitude variation in the magnetic field just upstream of the reconnection region , and more than two orders of magnitude variation in the reconnection rate .",
    "the simulations show that such localized forcing in 3d can indeed induce fast rates of reconnection similar to those observed in 2d , spontaneously reconnecting , narrow current sheet systems , even in magnetic geometries that would not reconnect at all in the absence of forcing .",
    "this result - that a system with a locally narrow current sheet will exhibit fast reconnection behavior ( whether the narrow current sheet is created by external forcing or is present initially ) - is reasonable but not obvious , since the magnetic geometries outside the forced zone in the two cases may be very different .",
    "this finding extends to 3d a similar result that was obtained in a larger 2d study @xcite , as well as an earlier 2d multi - code study of forced reconnection known as the newton challenge @xcite .",
    "the simulations in the newton challenge were initialized with a relatively narrow current sheet that was unstable to spontaneous reconnection but was somewhat thicker than the threshold required for fast ( alfvnic ) reconnection ( two ion skin depths compared to roughly one ) .",
    "the current sheet was then pinched by a spatially and temporally dependent inflow velocity imposed at the upstream boundary of the simulation domain .",
    "the result was that alfvnic reconnection indeed occurred in all studies that included the hall term , albeit with reconnection rates @xmath6 lower than those found in studies of spontaneous ( unforced ) reconnection in systems with somewhat narrower current sheets ( one ion skin depth ) .",
    "the work described here goes beyond the newton challenge to explore , over a wide range of parameters , the scaling of forced magnetic reconnection in a tearing mode stable ( @xmath7 ) system with an initially broad current sheet and a forcing function that is spatially localized in 3d .",
    "several limitations of the present work that are worth noting .",
    "our simulations explore the dynamics of forced reconnection in a cubical box of 25.6 ion skin depths ( the 3d analog of the gem challenge system @xcite ) using a simple isothermal two - fluid model @xcite and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the frozen - in condition is broken at the smallest scales in this model by electron inertia and numerical diffusion effects .",
    "particle simulations of reconnection , on the other hand , have shown that non - gyrotropic pressure tensor effects , which are not included here , should play the dominant role in this regard .",
    "past 2d studies of unforced reconnection ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have suggested that the reconnection rate is not strongly sensitive to this difference , and it is hoped that this insensitivity carries over to the present study .",
    "in addition , 2d particle simulations in much larger boxes are currently being used to study the sensitivity of the reconnection process to the boundary conditions and the physics of the electron diffusion region @xcite .",
    "due to the size limitations imposed by the 3d nature of our study , as well as the physical simplicity of our model , these important issues lie outside the scope of the present work .",

    "we will describe the results of a typical 2d run and then compare to a similar 3d case .",
    "first , however , some important definitions are required .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite and our previous 2d work  @xcite , we focus on the ion inflow @xmath95 , outflow @xmath96 , upstream reconnecting magnetic field @xmath97 , and upstream density @xmath98 , near the boundaries of the ion dissipation region where the ions decouple from both the electrons and the magnetic field . as found in earlier work  @xcite , the ion and electron velocities typically decouple approximately @xmath99 upstream of the x - point below the center of the forcing function , and we therefore measure the upstream quantities @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath98 at this location @xmath102 . the reconnecting component of the magnetic field does not vary strongly as a function of @xmath79 between 0.5 and 1.0 ion skin depths upstream of the x - point ; therefore , the results presented here are not strongly dependent upon the method used to determine the upstream edge of the dissipation region .",
    "this holds in both 2d and 3d .",
    "the electron outflow ( @xmath0 outflow in the x - direction ) typically becomes quite large very close to the x - point and can be in excess of the ion alfvn speed .",
    "however , at the downstream edge of the dissipation region , the electrons slow down to flow roughly with the ions .",
    "the location where the two flows come together is typically close to the location of the maximum in @xmath103 .",
    "therefore the downstream edge of the dissipation region is taken to be the location of the maximum in @xmath103 . defining the downstream edge as the location of the ion - electron velocity crossover point yields nearly identical results @xcite .",
    "a last important definition concerns the reconnection rate . in 2d , the reconnection rate is defined as the time derivative of the reconnected magnetic flux inside the magnetic island _ per unit length _ in the ( uniform ) @xmath93 direction : @xmath104 where @xmath80 is the plane where @xmath60 , and @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the x - locations of the x - point and o - point , respectively .",
    "a _ total _",
    "reconnection rate ( rather than a rate per unit length ) can not be defined in the 2d limit , since the uniformity of the system along @xmath93 implies that the total reconnected flux is infinite .",
    "this is not the case in the 3d simulations discussed here , in which the extent of the magnetic island and the total reconnected flux are both finite in the @xmath93 direction .",
    "thus in 3d it is natural to define the reconnection rate as simply the time derivative of the _ total _ reconnected flux inside the magnetic island : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the area of the magnetic island ( found numerically using field - line tracing ) in the central plane of the equilibrium current sheet @xmath109 .",
    "( [ by_multi ] ) shows a time series @xmath110 in this plane in a simulation discussed in the next section .",
    "the location of the forcing function , centered at @xmath111 , can be discerned from the dipolar signature in the right half of the figures .",
    "as we show below , nearly all the reconnected flux is inside this roughly circular region under the forcing function .",
    "( in both 2d and 3d , small secondary islands are also typically present ; however , the total flux in these islands is small and they have no significant impact on the reconnection rates reported here . ) the 3d reconnection rate given by eq .",
    "( [ 3dreconnectionrate ] ) has physical units of [ flux / time ] , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ 2dreconnectionrate ] ) , which has physical units of [ flux / time / length ] . to compare the 2d and 3d reconnection rates , the 3d rate therefore must be somehow translated into a reconnection rate per unit length , as in 2d .",
    "no unique way exists to do this , making a meaningful comparison of the 2d and 3d reconnection rates difficult .",
    "two crude approaches to such a comparison , however , are discussed further in the following section .          fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15 ] ) shows time series of the dissipation region parameters in typical 2d ( left ) and 3d ( right ) simulations . in the 2d simulation ,",
    "the asymptotic upstream forcing strength is @xmath112 , as seen from the solid curve in fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]g ) .",
    "note the level of forcing has become constant by @xmath113 .",
    "in panel ( a ) , we plot the outflow velocity ( dashed curve ) , and 5 times the inflow velocity ( dotted curve ) in the 2d case ( the factor of 5 serves to place the quantities on a similar scale ) . as the forcing is turned on , the inflow velocity increases , causing the pressure and density ( panel c ) to mount under the forcing function .",
    "this back pressure causes the inflow velocity to level off and then decrease around @xmath114 .",
    "magnetic flux also piles up under the forcing function causing the upstream field to increase , as seen in panel ( e ) during the period @xmath115 .",
    "consistent with past studies ( @xmath2 refs .",
    "@xcite ) , at about @xmath116 , when the flux pile - up has narrowed the current sheet to about an ion skin depth , the layer opens up into a petschek - like configuration and fast reconnection begins , as can be seen by the rise in the reconnection rate @xmath117 in panel ( g ) .",
    "this onset of reconnection causes @xmath100 to increase again and @xmath101 to level off , indicating that the rate of reconnection is sufficient to prevent further pile up of upstream flux , @xmath0 flux is liberated from the dissipation region by reconnection at a rate comparable to that with which flux is pumped into the region , so that @xmath101 is stable for an extended period ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 in this phase is consistent with continuity arguments : assuming in the 2d case that the ion diffusion region has a width @xmath120 and a length @xmath121 , the approximate incompressibility of the ion flow yields @xmath122 or @xmath123 . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ aspect ] ) , the value of @xmath124 is typically between 0.1 - 0.2 . here",
    "@xmath124 is computed by dividing the half - width at half - max of the current sheet at the location of the x - line by the distance from the x - line to the location of the peak ion outflow velocity along @xmath69 .",
    "the aspect ratio varies somewhat in time , approaching some minimum value then generally becoming slightly larger again as the current sheet opens up and shortens into a petschek - like configuration .",
    "strong reconnection continues in the 2d system for about another @xmath125 time units beyond the final time ( @xmath126 ) shown in the figures , at which point the system runs out of magnetic flux to reconnect and the reconnection rate drops sharply to zero .",
    "the features described here are observed at all levels of forcing in 2d that are sufficiently strong to trigger alfvnic reconnection . in ref .",
    "@xcite qualitatively similar results were found in a larger ( @xmath127 ) 2d system .    ) ) , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    several differences are apparent in comparing the 2d data shown in left half of fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15 ] ) with the 3d data in the right half .",
    "for example , the enhancement in the density ( panel d ) and upstream magnetic field ( panel f ) are weaker or more gradual in 3d than in 2d .",
    "this results from a key difference between 2d and 3d : in 2d flux can compress upstream of the current sheet or it can reconnect , flowing out along @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , density can build up under the forcing function or it can be cleared out by reconnection . in 3d , plasma and magnetic flux have the option of either reconnecting or flowing away from the forced zone along the @xmath128 directions .",
    "this difference has at least two important consequences : first , the forcing function is not as effective at compressing plasma and flux in 3d .",
    "indeed , the gradual rise in @xmath101 seen in fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]f ) results largely from the convection of stronger upstream magnetic field into the reconnection zone rather than from in - situ compression . to partially compensate for this , in fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15 ] ) we compare 2d and 3d simulations with somewhat different levels of forcing ( @xmath129 in 3d vs. @xmath130 in 2d as shown in figs .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]g , h ) ) .",
    "a second consequence , which we discuss further below , is that the reconnection `` efficiency '' in 3d is smaller than in 2d  that is , a smaller fraction of the upstream magnetic flux that is initially contained within the forced region is reconnected in 3d than in 2d , making the reconnecting phase of the 3d simulations shorter than those in the 2d runs .",
    "two measures of the reconnection rate are shown in fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]h ) .",
    "the dotted curve labeled @xmath117 , like panel ( g ) , is the integral given by eq .",
    "( [ 2dreconnectionrate ] ) calculated in the @xmath131 plane .",
    "this quantity is a rough measure of the rate of reconnection immediately under the center of the forcing function .",
    "although one might expect this @xmath131 location to yield the largest local reconnection rate , in fact substantially larger values can occur at negative @xmath93 values near the edge of the forced zone .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fluxevolution ] ) , which shows the @xmath93-dependence of the reconnected flux per unit @xmath93 [ eq .  ( [ 2dreconnectionrate ] ) without the time derivative ] at various times .",
    "the area under the curves at a given time yields the total reconnected flux [ eq .",
    "( [ 3dreconnectionrate ] ) without the time derivative ] .",
    "the flux distributions become skewed to the left at later times due to the dragging of the magnetic field by the electrons .",
    "this leftward electron flow carries the bulk of the ( rightward ) electric current density that supports the reversal in the reconnecting magnetic field @xmath132 .",
    "the transport of reconnected flux by the electron flow can also be seen in the downward drift of the @xmath110 profile in the center of the sheet shown in fig .",
    "( [ by_multi ] ) .",
    "this effect has also been reported in other studies of three - dimensional reconnection ( see , for example , refs .",
    "a second measure of the reconnection rate is shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]h ) labeled @xmath133 .",
    "this curve depicts the total reconnection rate @xmath134 given by eq .",
    "( [ 3dreconnectionrate ] ) divided by the full width of the forcing function along @xmath93 ( @xmath135 ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fluxevolution ] ) , this width roughly characterizes the extent along @xmath93 of the reconnected flux distribution and thus @xmath133 is a crude measure of the average reconnection rate per unit length in the 3d system .",
    "although the reconnection rates as characterized by these measures are somewhat smaller in the 3d system than those in the 2d case , we show in the the following section that , when the 2d and 3d reconnection rates are plotted as a function of the instantaneous values of the upstream reconnecting magnetic field [ figs .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15]e , f ) ] , similar results are obtained .",
    "that is , for a given value of the upstream magnetic field , the rates of reconnection characterized by either @xmath117 or @xmath133 are roughly comparable to the corresponding 2d values .        another feature apparent in the 3d data of fig .",
    "( [ timeseries_2_15 ] ) is the downturn in the reconnection rate ( panel h ) and upstream field ( panel f ) seen at @xmath136 . at this time ,",
    "nearly all of the magnetic flux in the forced zone has been expelled by the forcing function , and thus the system has effectively run out of flux to reconnect .",
    "this is much earlier than the otherwise similar collapse in the 2d reconnection rate at @xmath137 .",
    "as was noted earlier , less flux is reconnected in 3d because the plasma and magnetic field are free to flow outward along the @xmath128 directions without reconnecting . in 2d",
    ", the uniformity of the system along @xmath93 prevents any net transport of flux in that direction , and a much larger fraction of the initial upstream flux in 2d ( over 70% percent compared to about 10% in 3d ) ends up inside the magnetic islands at late times .    a final difference between 2d and 3d evident from figs.([timeseries_2_15]a , b ) is that the ratio @xmath138 in 3d is enhanced by roughly a factor of two over the 2d case . given that the layer aspect ratio @xmath124 [ fig",
    "( [ aspect ] ) ] shows a much smaller increase , this enhancement is inconsistent with the 2d continuity argument described earlier , @xmath123 . in the 3d simulations , however , the continuity relation must be modified by a geometric factor . in 2d , the ion outflow from the reconnection region is almost entirely along the @xmath69 direction with @xmath139 . in 3d ,",
    "as one can see from the snapshot shown in fig .",
    "( [ ion_outflow ] ) , the ion outflow is nearly omnidirectional with @xmath140 , and the ion diffusion region is disk - shaped ( like a hockey puck ) rather than rectangular . assuming this disk has radius @xmath141 and half - thickness @xmath142",
    ", plasma will thus flow into an area @xmath143 ( one surface of the disk ) and out through an area @xmath144 .",

    "we test two simple scaling relations for the plasma outflow and reconnection rate that have been found in past studies to characterize reconnection in some forced and unforced 2d systems ( @xmath2 @xcite ) . in the case of the outflow , the dynamics that cause reconnected field lines to accelerate plasma away from the x - point are similar to those of an alfvn wave , and so @xmath147 where @xmath148 . regarding the reconnection rate , for a given dissipation region of length @xmath141 and thickness @xmath142 , the continuity arguments discussed in the last section yield @xmath149 where @xmath150 in 2d and @xmath151 in 3d . assuming this inflow along @xmath79 carries an @xmath69-directed magnetic field @xmath101 into the dissipation region , the rate of reconnection per unit length along @xmath93 ( equivalent to the rate at which magnetic flux enters the reconnection zone per unit length along @xmath93 ) is @xmath152 .",

    "( [ scaling3dand2d]c , d ) , the quantity @xmath159 is plotted vs. @xmath101 to test the scaling of the reconnection rate given by eq .",
    "( [ ratescaling ] ) .",
    "plots based on @xmath133 rather than @xmath117 yield slightly larger but similar results .",
    "the dotted lines represent the expected scaling , assuming that @xmath160 and that the system has an unvarying dissipation region aspect ratio of @xmath161 ( steeper line ) or @xmath162 ( less steep ) . at the later times when the reconnection rates are highest",
    ", the data in the more strongly forced simulations roughly follow the expected trend . in the most weakly forced runs ,",
    "however , the scaling progressively breaks down ; the perturbation of the current sheet in these cases is insufficient to trigger fast reconnection before a nearly force - balanced state is reached .",
    "we have examined the scaling behavior of reconnection in a forced , three - dimensional , periodic system using two - fluid simulations with finite electron inertia . the forcing in the simulations",
    "was driven by a spatially localized forcing function added to the ion momentum equation inside the computational domain .",
    "we initialized the system with a one dimensional , broad current sheet equilibrium that was tearing - mode stable ; three dimensional structure entered through the localization of the forcing function .",
    "comparisons were made to analogous two - dimensional simulations .    in the two dimensional case , as found our previous work in larger 2d systems @xcite , sufficiently strong levels of forcing were found to produce a quasi - steady petschek - like reconnection configuration with a dissipation region aspect ratio @xmath163 .",
    "the forcing function produces a pileup of magnetic flux in the upstream region and hence an increase in the upstream magnetic field , until the reconnection rate becomes sufficient to prevent further pileup of magnetic flux .",
    "the flux pile - up typically halts once a relatively thin current sheet is formed  between 0.5 and 1.0 ion skin depths in width  at which point the magnetic separatrix opens up , and fast , alfvnic reconnection begins , leading to a period when the upstream reconnecting field @xmath101 is relatively stable .",
    "the rate of reconnection per unit length along the ( ignorable ) @xmath93 direction was found to scale roughly like @xmath164 , as expected from simple scaling arguments , although significant time variations are observed during the course of any given run than can not be explained by this simple scaling .        in three dimensions ,",
    "freedom of the plasma to flow out in the @xmath128 directions makes the forcing function less effective at compressing plasma ; the resulting flux pile - up is weaker in 3d , convection dominates over compression in the upstream region , and the period of reconnection is shorter than in comparable 2d systems .",
    "the localization of the magnetic island along @xmath93 in 3d makes it possible to define a total reconnection rate , rather than a rate per unit length , as in 2d . for sufficiently strong forcing , this total rate , like in 2d result , was found to be roughly proportional @xmath164 .    to directly compare the 2d and 3d reconnection rates one must translate the 3d rate into a rate per unit @xmath93 , as in 2d .",
    "two rough methods of extracting such a quasi-2d rate from the 3d data were described  one of which is simply to divide the total rate in 3d by the width of the forcing function  with similar results . when either of these two rates are plotted as a function of the upstream magnetic field , the 2d and 3d results are comparable . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of reconnected magnetic flux in 3d becomes strongly skewed at late times by the flow of electrons in the current layer , and near the edge of the forcing function , the flux builds at local rates that can substantially exceed the 2d values ."
