    "the crucial role of fluid membranes as a component of living cells was recognized early on by biologists @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the mechanics of membranes has become a fertile area of research among physicists as well @xcite .",
    "many cellular tasks such as exo- or endocytosis @xcite , the formation of vesicles @xcite , or the interaction with the cytoskeleton @xcite rely heavily on mechanical membrane properties and can be studied using the mathematical toolbox of theoretical physics .",
    "various key questions are of an essentially geometrical nature : what is the shape adopted by a membrane subjected to some specified boundary conditions @xcite ? how are forces and torques transmitted through the membrane @xcite ?",
    "which interactions does this imply @xcite ?    to answer questions such as these , one approach is to apply an effective formulation in which the membrane is modeled as a two - dimensional surface in space .",
    "this approach is valid provided the length scales of interest are much longer than the membrane thickness which typically is a few nanometers .",
    "the energy of the membrane is then completely determined by the geometry of the surface . in distinction to a simple fluid - fluid interface where the energy is dominated by surface tension @xcite , bending elasticity now becomes important @xcite .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to determine equilibrium profiles by solving a field equation ( the `` shape equation '' ) which follows from the minimization of the energy with respect to surface deformations .",
    "the forces and torques transmitted by the membrane are then imprinted on its shape .",
    "the shape equation is a fourth order nonlinear partial differential equation ; as such , it can only be solved analytically in a few exceptional cases .",
    "one approach to sidestepping this obstacle is to expand the energy up to quadratic order .",
    "unfortunately , this approach has the drawback that it is only valid if the surface is a weak perturbation of some underlying reference shape , such as a plane or a sphere .",
    "if the membrane is highly curved , linearization becomes inadequate and other strategies need to be developed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an alternative approach was presented .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to relate the forces and torques to the local membrane geometry without any need to solve the shape equation itself .",
    "the link is formed by the surface stress tensor and its torque counterpart .",
    "this approach has already proven its value when applied to the problem of surface - mediated interactions @xcite : particles bound to a membrane interact because they deform its shape @xcite . in the traditional approach to this problem based on energy ,",
    "the force between particles is calculated in three steps : first , the equilibrium shape of the membrane is determined for a given placement of the particles by solving the linearized shape equation .",
    "the energy of the surface is then evaluated by integration , and finally differentiated with respect to appropriate placement variables of the bound particles .",
    "this approach relies heavily on the validity of the linearization .",
    "instead , one can also relate the force between the particles directly to the local geometry of the surface via the surface stress tensor .",
    "it becomes possible to establish a host of valuable exact nonlinear results @xcite .    in this context",
    "the particles were fixed by horizontal forces allowing all other degrees of freedom , among them their vertical positions or tilts , to equilibrate . to gain further insight",

    ", we will examine symmetric two - particle configurations , thereby obtaining a transparent analytical expression describing the balance of torques which is valid in the fully nonlinear regime .",
    "we will examine exactly the interaction of two membrane - bound parallel cylinders .",
    "this is possible because the membrane profile behaves like a one - dimensional elasticum of euler @xcite , a wormlike chain in the language of polymer physics @xcite ; thus it can be integrated exactly .",
    "this apparently simple system displays remarkably subtle behavior . for strong membrane deformations the results of the small gradient approximation @xcite fail and nonlinear effects , such as multiple solutions for one given set of parameters , emerge .",
    "moreover , the simple exponential decay of the force or the cylinder tilt angle as a function of separation , which is correct for small deformations @xcite , gives way to a more complicated dependency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : torquesonsurfacepatches ] we will discuss how torques on surface patches can be determined within the framework of refs .  @xcite . to begin with , we will treat a geometrical hamiltonian which is given by a surface integral over a local density .",

    "the tangent vectors of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , form a local coordinate frame ; together with the extrinsic unit normal vector , @xmath4 , they define two geometrical tensors on the surface : the metric @xmath5 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the external torque @xmath37 _ on the surface patch _",
    "@xmath38 is then simply given by @xmath39 due to torque balance .",

    "the surface tensor @xmath44 is the covariantly conserved torque tensor .",
    "it consists of two parts : a contribution due to the couple of the stress tensor @xmath18 about the origin as well as an intrinsic contribution proportional to @xmath45 which originates only from curvature terms .",
    "the value of the former does depend on the choice of origin ; however , its intrinsic counterpart is independent of this choice .",
    "one can easily check that the divergence of @xmath24 , @xmath46 , is indeed zero in mechanical equilibrium as required by consistency with noether s theorem .",
    "the occurence of curvature terms in the hamiltonian is ultimately due to the fact that the physical surface is not infinitely thin but has an inhomogeneous force distribution along its transverse direction @xcite .",
    "if one captures this internal structure in the strictly two - dimensional hamiltonian  ( [ eq : surfacefunctional ] ) , the curvature terms give rise to an intrinsic torque density and a non - vanishing normal component of the stress tensor .",
    "note that the torque tensor , like the stress tensor , depends only on geometric properties of the surface ( modulo a contribution that is due to a shift of the origin ) .",
    "it is thus always possible in principle to determine the torques operating on a patch of surface from a knowledge of the shape of the surface alone .",
    "the snag is to determine the correct shape .",

    "thus the intrinsic torque vanishes and , using @xmath51 , one obtains @xcite , @xmath52 the torque on a surface patch @xmath53 is therefore given by @xmath54 it is simple to interpret this expression : the tangential stress @xmath55 provides a torque per unit length at every point of the contour @xmath40 . the line integral along @xmath40 yields the total external torque on the surface patch .",

    "in addition , if @xmath70 is constant on @xmath40 , the intrinsic part of the torque tensor does not contribute to @xmath79 at all .",

    "we will now show how the framework provided by the torque tensor may be applied to the study of membrane - mediated interactions .",
    "particles bound to an interface may interact via the deformations they impose on the surface geometry .",
    "consider , for instance , a multiparticle configuration such as the one depicted in fig .  [ fig : identification ] : forces as well as torques act on each of the particles due to the distortions in the shape caused by the others .",
    "such a situation can thus only be stationary if the particle positions and orientations are constrained by external forces and torques , respectively .",
    "as we have shown , these forces and torques are determined completely by the surface geometry .",
    "the external torque acting on the particle that adheres to the surface patch @xmath53 , for instance , is equal to the external torque @xmath79 acting on the whole patch as given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : torque ] ) ; this is because the torque tensor is divergence - free on any part of the surface not acted upon externally .",
    "the torque @xmath81 we will consider in the following is the torque on the particle @xmath82 mediated by the interface _ counteracting _ the corresponding external torque ; the former is evidently equal to minus the latter ( for @xmath83 one thus has @xmath84 ) .",
    "similar arguments apply to the force @xmath85 on the @xmath86 particle as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .      the total force and",
    "the total torque must vanish if the multiparticle configuration is in mechanical equilibrium : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the force and @xmath89 the torque on the outer boundary @xmath25 ( see again fig .",
    "[ fig : identification ] ) .    in the following",
    ", we will consider , in particular , a symmetric fluid membrane with nonvanishing surface tension @xmath49 characterized by the hamiltonian density  ( [ eq : hamiltonianfluidmembrane ] ) .",
    "its ground state in the absence of particles is an infinite flat plane with zero curvature . in this case",
    "the energy is proportional to the area and thus infinite .",
    "this infinite constant in the energy will play no role in the sequel , and we will recalibrate the energy to set it to zero .",
    "particles that are bound to the membrane typically deform its shape and increase its energy .",
    "these energy changes , however , must be _ finite _ whenever the forces and torques applied to fix the particle configuration are finite .",
    "this implies that the interface becomes asymptotically flat remote from the particles , even if @xmath49 is infinitesimally small ( see app .  [ app : scalingarguments ] ) .",
    "it is useful to decompose forces and torques into a horizontal part parallel to the asymptotic plane and a vertical part orthogonal to it .",
    "when the surface tension vanishes , kim _ _ et__@xmath47_al .",

    "[ app : scalingarguments ] we extend their discussion to treat situations in which @xmath90 .",
    "the change is non - trivial : it turns out that , whereas the vertical force vanishes as before , the horizontal torque does not necessarily vanish .",
    "in antisymmetric configurations , such as the ones that we will consider in the next section , it is this horizontal contribution on the outer boundary that makes it possible to balance an external torque .    in the following section , the complete set of equations describing force and total torque balance [ see eqns .",
    "( [ eq : totalforcetorquebalance ] ) ] in a symmetrical two - particle configuration will be derived .",
    "consider a symmetrical configuration of two identical particles bound to an asymptotically flat surface as described in refs .",

    "we label by @xmath91 the cartesian orthonormal basis vectors of three - dimensional space @xmath92 adapted to the asymptotic plane .",
    "the vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 lie parallel to this plane whereas @xmath95 is its upward pointing unit normal .",
    "we will discuss two possible symmetries : mirror symmetry in the @xmath96 plane ( the symmetric case ) or a twofold symmetry with respect to the @xmath97 axis ( the antisymmetric case ) .",
    "the line joining corresponding points on the particles lies parallel to the @xmath98 plane .",
    "we place the origin of the coordinate system in the middle between the two particles on the intersection line of asymptotic and symmetry plane ( symmetric case ) or the line of symmetry ( antisymmetric case ) , respectively .",
    "external torques on the surface can either be vertical or horizontal .",
    "the former can not be compensated by the outer boundary .",
    "the physical explanation for this is that the surface does not resist shear forces .",
    "horizontal torques , however , can be balanced ( see app .",
    "[ app : scalingarguments ] ) which is necessary for a stable configuration : the separation between the particles is fixed by _ horizontal _ constraining forces . in the antisymmetric case , the two particles do not generally lie on the same line of action .",
    "thus the forces will apply a horizontal torque @xmath99 to the surface which has to be balanced by the outer boundary . in the following",
    ", we will consider situations in which this torque is the only external torque _ on the entire surface_.    this restriction does not exclude external vertical torques @xmath81 _ on the individual particles _ ; the symmetry will not be broken as long as all these torques cancel .",
    "think , for instance , of a symmetric configuration consisting of two spheres on a soap film with a saddle - shaped ( quadrupolar ) line of contact @xcite .",
    "a vertical torque @xmath100 on one of the particles is consistent with the symmetry so long as a torque @xmath101 is applied to its partner .",
    "such possibilities may , in principle , be accommodated within the formalism . here",
    ", however , we will only consider situations in which the particle orientations have equilibrated and these torques vanish .",
    "as explained previously , the torque on the left particle can be obtained by integrating the appropriate projection of the torque tensor along a contour surrounding the particle @xmath102 we choose the same contour of integration as used in refs .",

    "furthermore , the term proportional to @xmath110 vanishes for the two symmetries because @xmath111 on branch 1 @xcite .",

    "as @xmath114 lies in the asymptotic plane due to our choice of origin , it would appear to be self - evident that the line integral vanishes .",
    "if this argument were correct , it would also apply to the complete outer boundary enclosing both particles and it would be impossible to balance the external torque .",
    "how then can a stable equilibrium be attained in the antisymmetric case if , as was argued earlier , an external torque is unavoidable ?",
    "fortunately , a closer inspection of the integral shows that it does not necessarily always vanish : for when branches 24 are sent to infinity , while the vertical force component indeed does converge to zero , the length @xmath115 of the corresponding lever arm goes to infinity simultaneously .",
    "additionally , one integrates along a contour whose length depends linearly on @xmath115 .",
    "these two effects permit a finite value to remain : if we parametrize the remote regions of the membrane in terms of a height function above the asymptotic plane and consider its series expansion  ( [ eq : heightfunctionmongeparametrization ] ) for large @xmath115 , a non - vanishing horizontal torque remains if the slowest decaying term is of order @xmath116 .",
