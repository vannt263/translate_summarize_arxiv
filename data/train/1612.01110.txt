    "janus nanoparticles are characterized as particles with two or more surfaces with distinct chemical or physical properties .",
    "they have distinct shapes , as spheres , rods , disks and dumbbells , and can assemble in a variety of nanoscale morphologies like spheres , cylinders , lamellae phases and micelles with distinct shapes and functionality  @xcite .",
    "due it versatility , janus nanoparticles have promising application to medicine , self - driven molecules , catalysis , photonic crystals , stable emulsion and self - healing materials  @xcite .",
    "particularly , janus dimers  @xcite are nanoparticles formed by two monomers linked together .",
    "each monomer has distinct functionality and characteristic , as well can have different size .",
    "regarding to diffusion , we can rise two interesting phenomena .",
    "the first is the anomalous diffusion .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is obtained from the scaling factor between the mean square displacement , @xmath0 , and the exponent of time , @xmath1 . for regular , or fick , diffusive process ,",
    "@xmath2 . if @xmath3 we say that the system is superdiffusive , and if @xmath4 the regime is subdiffusive . for brownian systems ,",
    "the collisions between solute and solvent and the solvent viscosity , considered using a white noise and a drag force  @xcite , usually lead the system to a fick diffusion . on the other hand , for molecular systems , where there is no solvent effects",
    ", the fick diffusion is achieved due the collisions between the particles of the system .",
    "if the collision are rare , as in a infinitively diluted gas , the diffusion tends to be ballistic .",
    "anomalous diffusion was observed in several systems , as proteins and colloids in crowded environments  @xcite , self - propelled particles  @xcite and confined nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the second interesting phenomena is the diffusion anomaly . for most materials ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient decreases when the pressure ( or density ) increases .",
    "however , materials as water  @xcite , silicon  @xcite and silica  @xcite show diffusion anomaly , characterized by a maximum in the diffusion coefficient at constant temperature .",
    "besides diffusion ( or dynamical ) anomaly , water , silicon , silica and others fluids , the so - called anomalous fluids , also have other classes of anomalies , as structure and thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "experimental studies have reported the production of silver - silicon ( ag - si)@xcite and silica - polystyrene ( sio@xmath5-ps)@xcite dimeric nanoparticles .",
    "therefore , we have a janus dumbbell with one anomalous monomer and another regular , or non - anomalous , monomer . inspired in this specific shape and composition , we have proposed a model to study this class of nanoparticles  @xcite based in a effective two length scales potential  @xcite to model the anomalous monomer , while the regular monomer is modeled with a standard lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .",
    "we have shown that despite the presence of the non - anomalous monomer , the diffusion anomaly was preserved .",
    "usually , colloidal solutions are dissolved in a solvent - as water . in these cases ,",
    "langevin dynamics has been employed to mimic the solvent effects in the colloids  @xcite . on the other hand , molecular systems , without solvent effects , are relevant as well .",
    "for instance , muna and urbic recently proposed a model for alcohols combining anomalous and regular monomers  @xcite and ubirc proposed a model for methanol  @xcite . as well , anomalies in dimeric anomalous systems has been object of computational studies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question that rises is how the janus dimer will behave when the brownian dynamics effects are removed . in this way , we perform intensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using the berendsen thermostat .",
    "comparisons are made with the system behavior in our previous work  @xcite , where we have used the langevin thermostat .",
    "the dimers are confined between two parallel walls , in order to simulate a thin film .",
    "we show how the thermostat affects the aggregation , the dynamic and the thermodynamic properties of this janus nanoparticle .",
    "specially , we show how the absence of solvent effects leads the system to have not only diffusion anomaly , but also a superdiffusive regime related to a highly ordered structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we introduce the model and describe the methods and simulation details ; next the results and discussion are given ; and then we present our conclusions .",
    "the system consists in janus dumbbells confined between two flat and parallel plates separated by a fixed distance in z - direction .",
    "the janus particles are formed by @xmath6 dimers , totalizing @xmath7 monomers , linked rigidly at a distance @xmath8 .",
    "the monomers can be of type a and type b. particles of type a interact through a two length scales shoulder potential , defined as  @xcite    @xmath9 + \\ ] ] @xmath10   \\label{alaneq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the distance between two a particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the first term is a standard 12 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential  @xcite and the second one is a gaussian shoulder centered at @xmath14 , with depth @xmath15 and width @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , this potential is represented by potential aa .",
    "monomeric and dimeric bulk systems modeled by this potential present thermodynamic , dynamic and structural anomalies like observed in water , silica and other anomalous fluids  @xcite . under confinement",
    ", the monomeric system also presents water - like anomalies and interesting structural phase transitions  @xcite .",
    ".,width=453 ]    particles of type b interact through a standard 12 - 6 lj potential , whose equation is the same of first term of eq .",
    "[ alaneq ] .",
    "this potential is represented in figure  [ fig1 ] by potential bb .",
    "we use a cutoff radius of @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the interaction between particles of type a and type b is given by a weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential , defined as  @xcite    @xmath21    the wca potential considers just the repulsive part of the standard 12 - 6 lj potential , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] by potential ab .",
    "dimers and walls also interact by a wca potential , but projected in the @xmath22-direction ,    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 .    the walls are fixed in @xmath22-direction separated by a distance of @xmath25 .",
    "we choose this separation to observe the effects of strong confinement , like in quasi-2d thin films .",
    "standard periodic boundary conditions are applied in @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "the simulations are done in nvt - ensemble using a home made program .",

    "we simulate systems varying the values of @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 to obtain different densities .",
    "we use the shake algorithm  @xcite to link rigidly each dimer at a distance of @xmath8 .",
    "we performed @xmath35 steps to equilibrate the system followed by @xmath36 steps run for the results production stage .",
    "the equilibrium state was checked by the analysis of potential and kinetic energies as well the snapshots of distinct simulation times .",
    "simulations with up to @xmath37 particles were carried out , and essentially the same results were obtained .",
    "the dynamic of the system was analyzed by the lateral mean square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath38 .",

    "for instance , we take the isochore @xmath81 , where the janus dimers are assembled in both emi and sem .",
    "the lateral mean square displacement for temperature @xmath82 , red dashed line in figure  [ compare](a ) , shows an initial ballistic behavior , and a fick regime as @xmath83 . on the other hand , for @xmath84 ,",
    "black dashed curve in figure  [ compare](a ) , the initial ballistic evolves to a superdiffusive regime , with @xmath85 .",
    "this superdiffusive regime was observed in all sem structures , with @xmath86 ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath88 . for simplicity",
    ", we will not show all lateral mean square displacement curves .",
    "basically , in the fluid regions and for all aggregates , except the sem , the nanoparticles collisions lead the system to the fick regime .",
    "however , in the sem lamellae phase , the liquid - crystal structure prevents the collisions . as consequence , the dimers moves freely in the line defined by the structure , leading to the superdiffusive regime . for the brownian system  @xcite , since the lamellae phase is not straight , but rippled , the supperdifusive regime was not observed .",
    "this shows how that the white noise and drag force from the brownian dynamics effects on the dynamic will reflect in the structure . particularly , the sem region corresponds to a region where the translational order parameter @xmath56 has a maximum .",
    "this result , shown in figure  [ compare](b ) , highlights the relation between structure and dynamics .",
    "therefore , the sem micelles are highly diffused and highly structured aggregates .",
    "this relation between structure and dynamics is well known in the literature of anomalous fluids  @xcite .",

    "the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath38 is a powerful tool to understand the dynamics of the systems . in figure  [ compare](c )",
    "we show @xmath38 as function of time for @xmath80 and temperatures ranging from @xmath84 to @xmath82 .",
    "the superdiffusive regime and sem micelles were observed for @xmath84 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ compare](c ) , at these temperatures the curves cross the zero axis at shorter times than in the fick regime with emi micelles , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that in the superdiffusive regime the nanoparticles are strongly caged by the neighbors dimers .",
    "thereat , we know that the system has a superdiffusion regime related to a collective behavior and assembly in a specific well structured micelle .    it is well reported in the literature that the competition between the two scales in the eq .",
    "( [ alaneq ] ) is the main ingredient to a fluid present water - like anomalies  @xcite . to see the influence of this competition",
    ", we analyzed the @xmath49 for the a monomers when the system enters and leaves the sem phase . as we show in figure  [ compare](d ) , when we walk through the isochore @xmath80 , from @xmath93  before the superdiffusion region  to @xmath94  the limit of the superdiffusion region ",
    "the first peak in the @xmath49 decays , while the second peak rises .",
    "this is the competition between the scales , where the particles moves from one of the preferential distances to the other .",
    "as we heat the system , both peaks decays , as when we walk from @xmath94 to @xmath82  outside the superdiffusive regime .",
    "therefore , the competition between the two length scales leads the nanoparticles from a non - oriented fick diffusion elongated micellae phase to a oriented superdiffusive elongated micellae phase .    .",

    "the regions where the distinct self - assembled structures were observed are indicated in the phase - diagram .",
    "in addition to the anomalous diffusion , the system also shows diffusion anomaly .",
    "this anomaly is characterized by the maximum and minimum in the curve of the lateral diffusion coefficient @xmath102 as function of density at constant temperature .",
    "the figure  [ phase - diagram](b ) shows these curves , with the diffusion extrema indicated .",
    "this extrema is also shown in the phase diagram .",
    "notice that the anomaly region occurs in the fluid and in the sm phase , indicating that the anomaly can be observed in spherical micelles . in this way , it is possible to construct spherical self - assembled structure that will diffuse faster when compressed . as usual ,",
    "the diffusion anomaly is explained using the competition between the two scales .",
    "the graphic showing this was omitted for simplicity , since this result is well known and discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "another interesting difference between the brownian and the molecular system @xmath101 phase diagram is the absence of a melting induced by the density increase in the sem phase  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the melting scenario for this janus nanoparticles is strongly affected by the solvent .",
    "as well , the fluid phase structure is also affected .",
    "this is evident once for the molecular system we have not observed the density anomaly , only the diffusion anomaly . for the brownian system , the density anomalous region ended in the melting induced by density increase region .",
    "therefore , this comparison between the browinian and molecular system has shown that not only the dynamical behavior are distinct , what was expected due the thermostats characteristics , but also the structural , assembly and thermodynamic properties of these nanoparticles are strongly affected .",
    "we reported the study of janus nanoparticles confined in a thin film . here",
    ", the effects of brownian motion were removed , and we studied the molecular system without solvent .",
    "this system has special interest in the design of new material using the confinement to control the self - assembled structures .",
    "we have found a rich variety of aggregates and micelles , including structures not observed in the bulk system or in the brownian system .",
    "more than that , our results show that the more structured micelle has an anomalous diffusion , with a superdiffusive regime related to a maximum in the translational order parameter .",
    "we have shown that this anomalous diffusion is related to the competition between the two length scales .",
    "as well , the system have diffusion anomaly , where the diffusion constant increases with the density increases .",
    "these results show that materials which can be modeled by two length scale potentials have an interesting and peculiar behavior .",
    "new studies on this system are in progress , as anisotropy effects .",
