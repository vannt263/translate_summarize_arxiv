    "the heavy fermion ( hf ) family has been a constant source of scientific interest for many years , owing to the rich variety of electronic properties and competing ground states .",
    "these can be be tuned within an experimentally accessible region of pressure , magnetic field , or chemical substitution .",
    "many of the most interesting features of these compounds are found where the localised @xmath4 electrons are on the border of itinerancy , and strong interactions with the more loosely bound conduction electrons have a hugely important effect .",
    "superconductivity is one of the most striking properties of many hf ce compounds .",
    "the superconducting pairing mechanism is still not fully understood , but the presence of a local magnetic moment at each ce site strongly disfavours a phonon - mediated interaction .",
    "the leading candidate for the pairing mechanism in hf superconductors has been mediation by low energy spin fluctuations around a so - called magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "this is where the magnetic ordering temperature is driven to zero at a pressure @xmath5 , if pressure is the control parameter , and quantum fluctuations between competing ground states dominate the properties of the system .",
    "for example in cepd@xmath0si@xmath0  and cein@xmath6 , superconductivity was found in a small dome around the qcp , but only in samples of very high purity , where the electronic mean free path exceeded the superconducting coherence length @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the nature of singularity at @xmath5 has usually been treated as second order , however this view may not be entirely correct @xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion superconductor cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 has a very unusually shaped superconducting region in the pressure - temperature phase diagram , and its isoelectronic parent compound cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 displays very similar behaviour under larger compression .",
    "it was recently shown that the addition of ge impurities to cecu@xmath0(si@xmath8ge@xmath9)@xmath0 separates the superconducting region into two separate domes , centred on the antiferromagnetic qcp and a valence transition respectively @xcite .",
    "we have argued that cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  has a second mechanism of superconductivity at high pressure , where critical valence fluctuations , between ce @xmath10 and @xmath11 $ ] electronic configurations form the basis of the pairing mechanism@xcite .",
    "these are associated with a nearly first order valence instability , analogous to the ce @xmath12 transition with a critical end point close to zero temperature .",
    "there is a good deal of evidence for an abrupt change in ce valence , along with several anomalies in the normal state , close the pressure at which @xmath13  attains its maximum value of around 2.5@xmath2k .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature also displays a very anisotropic response to uniaxial stress@xcite , similar to the effect seen in cepd@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the strong sensitivity of @xmath13  to the ratio of tetragonal lattice parameters @xmath14 seen in the ce@xmath15in@xmath16 ( @xmath15  co , rh , ir ) and pu@xmath15ga@xmath16 ( @xmath15  co , rh ) compounds @xcite .",
    "if we accept that superconductivity at high pressure in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  is mediated by valence fluctuations , does it have any uniquely identifying features ? more specifically , is there any way to recognize such a compound without an exhaustive pressure investigation such as reported in @xcite ?",
    "since cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  is so far the only firm example of this phenomenon , it is hard to say what is a characteristic feature of valence fluctuation ( vf ) mediated superconductivity , and what is unique to cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the resistivity @xmath17 and specific heat ( by ac calorimetry ) of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  in a hydrostatic helium pressure medium , along with further resistivity measurements on a variety of samples in a quasi - hydrostatic steatite medium . by providing some detailed results we can perhaps provide some clues that might be used to recognize vf mediated superconductivity elsewhere .",
    "si@xmath0 , in a helium pressure transmitting medium .",
    "note the large and pressure dependent transition widths.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure  [ fig1 ] the resistance of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  below 4@xmath2k and up to 6.5@xmath2gpa in hydrostatic conditions is shown .",
    "the width of the resistive superconducting transition varies strongly with pressure .",
    "it is sharp at the lowest pressure , where @xmath13  is close to its ambient pressure value .",
    "however , when @xmath13  increases sharply around 23@xmath2gpa , the transition width becomes very broad , of the same order as @xmath13  itself .",
    "close to the maximum of the transition temperature , the transition sharpens again , though never becoming as sharp as at ambient pressure .",
    "it should be noted that the maximum @xmath13  does not coincide with the narrowest transition in the high pressure region .",
    "the very broad transition at 1.76@xmath2gpa was investigated in some detail , and it was shown that the upper part of the resistance drop could be suppressed by increasing the measurement current , leading to a sharp transition with a width close to the ambient pressure value . the @xmath18 point could be suppressed more rapidly with a magnetic field than the upper part . along with the observation that the specific heat jump coincided with the point at which the resistance vanished ,",
    "these indicated the presence of filamentary superconductivity with a characteristic temperature much higher than that of the majority of the sample .",
    "the exact details of the superconducting transition vary substantially between samples and with pressure conditions ( see @xcite for further examples ) .",
    "however these broad resistive transitions appear to be a universal feature of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  at high pressure , regardless of the pressure conditions .",
    "let us recall that even for the highest @xmath19 measured in a single crystal , at 2.4@xmath2k , a tail of 1% of the normal state resistivity remained well below 2@xmath2k , vanishing only at 1.5@xmath2k ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can note , however , that the pressure dependence of @xmath20 is remarkably well reproduced between many different samples when normalised to its value at p=0 , while @xmath21 displays much more scatter .",
    "the status of the superconductivity of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  between @xmath21 and @xmath20 remains mysterious .",
    "the recently discovered hf superconductor cenige@xmath6 @xcite displays similarly broad transition widths , along with a large increase in residual resistivity , and is probably the most likely candidate for valence fluctuation mediated superconductivity in another compound .",
    "the ce@xmath15in@xmath16 systems have also been shown to have a fairly large pressure dependence of their resistive transition widths , though perhaps not to the same extent .",
    "the relative position of the magnetic and valence instability pressures @xmath5 and @xmath22  may play an important role in the presence or otherwise of vf mediated superconductivity in other ce - based hf compounds .",
    "cecu@xmath0(ge , si)@xmath0 remains the only case in which it is clear that @xmath23 .",
    ", ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . note that it remains sharp up to 3.7@xmath2gpa , but starts to broaden and collapse even before @xmath13  reaches a maximum .",
    "the amplitude of the jump seems to be much larger closer to @xmath1gpa than at low pressure near @xmath5 , however there remains the possibility that this is an experimental artefact.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows the superconducting transition in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  as detected by ac calorimetry in a helium pressure medium .",
    "details of the experimental technique , along with some discussion its limitations can be found in ref .",
    "it should be noted that the curves shown almost certainly contain a substantial minority contribution from the pressure medium and diamond anvils , so precise quantitative comparisons are difficult .",
    "however , the shape of the specific heat jump is a legitimate topic for discussion .",
    "as noted above , the beginning of the @xmath24 transition corresponds precisely to the temperature at which the resistivity reaches zero .",
    "one should notice that the jump starts off relatively small and sharp , then grows much bigger as @xmath13 increases , while remaining sharp .",
    "before @xmath13 reaches a maximum , the specific heat peak starts to broaden and then collapses in amplitude as the pressure is increased further and @xmath13 is driven to zero .",
    "on reducing the pressure , the specific heat jump reversibly regains its shape , so we can rule out a disintegration of the sample . again while we emphasise that the results shown here are only semi - quantitative , the apparent large increase in the magnitude of @xmath25 around 3@xmath2gpa from is sufficiently reminiscent of the huge specific heat jump seen in cecoin@xmath16 to merit further investigation , if technical progress permits it .",
    "of two polycrystalline cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  samples prepared by ishikawa .",
    "note the large increase in residual resistivity under pressure combined with a nearly complete resistive transition.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one of the most striking features of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  is the huge enhancement of the residual resistivity @xmath26 under pressure , which was explained theoretically by miyake and maebashi @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the coexistence of superconductivity with such enhanced impurity scattering , a situation highly unlikely in a spin fluctuation mediation scenario .",
    "the normal state resistivity at @xmath13  can reach of the order of the ioffe - regel limit ( which turns out to be about 100@xmath27 cm at ambient pressure ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows resistivities of two polycrystalline samples whose compositions vary by tiny amounts within the homogeneity range @xcite .",
    "the superconducting transitions are shown both at ambient pressure , and at 4.34@xmath2gpa , close to the maximum of @xmath26 .",
    "the sample labelled # 50 has a slightly lower @xmath13  at ambient pressure than sample # 57 , along with a residual resistivity of the order of 70@xmath28 cm if the normal state resistivity is extrapolated to @xmath29 .    at 4.34@xmath2gpa",
    ", the normal state resistivity at @xmath13 , has more than doubled in sample # 50 , and increased substantially in sample # 57 , and the resistive transition is nearly ( though not totally ) complete in both .",
    "similar behaviour has been seen in single crystalline cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  samples @xcite .",
    "comparing the temperature dependence of the normal state , it seems that the enhancement of the impurity scattering is reduced as temperature increases , and the two samples show very similar behaviour approaching room temperature .",
    "the results discussed in the previous section indicated that there exists another temperature dependent contribution to the resistivity in addition to the usual electron - electron , phonon , and magnetic scattering terms .",
    "this is the vf enhanced impurity scattering .",
    "according to the theoretical prediction @xcite , the residual resistivity @xmath30 at @xmath29 is given by @xmath31 where the coefficient @xmath32 is determined by the host metal band structure , @xmath33 is the concentration of impurities with moderate scattering potential @xmath34 coming from disorder other than ce ions , @xmath35 is the density of states of quasiparticles around the fermi level , and the last term represents the residual resistivity due to unitary scattering mainly arising from any deficit or defect of the ce ions ( likely to be small in the samples reported ) .",
    "the term @xmath36 is a measure of the rate of valence change with pressure ( which acts through the @xmath4-level @xmath37 , and is maximum at the valence instability pressure @xmath22 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the enhanced impurity scattering has not so far been predicted , and progress on this front would be very useful , in order to better analyse any non - fermi liquid exponents in the quasiparticle scattering . according to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , there should be a term with negative temperature dependence , reminiscent of the kondo impurity term , and indeed such behaviour has been attributed to scattering from remaining ce@xmath38 ` impurities ' in the intermediate valence regime @xcite .     quasiparticle scattering , and a temperature dependent impurity term . only at 7.20@xmath2gpa is the negative slope of the latter visible in this sample.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fig4 ] illustrates how a negative slope of @xmath39 can occur due to the competition between the quasiparticle and impurity scattering at high pressure , in another sample of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 . at the pressures shown",
    ", superconductivity is being suppressed , and the @xmath40 coefficient of the quasiparticle scattering @xmath41 is rapidly falling , indicating the transition from a heavy fermion to valence fluctuating regime . only at 7.20@xmath2gpa is there a clear minimum in the resistivity , around 6@xmath2k . at lower pressure ,",
    "the @xmath40 coefficient was large enough to mask the impurity contribution , while at still higher pressure , the enhancement of the residual resistivity is reduced as the system moves away from the valence instability .",
    "one very puzzling observation in some samples was a further change in the sign of the slope as @xmath42 , giving a maximum around 4@xmath2k , which persists in a magnetic field large enough to suppress any trace of superconductivity @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown some unexplained features of the high pressure superconducting and normal state of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0  around the valence instability , with the aim that these might be better explained theoretically , and also as possible signposts for critical valence fluctuations in other compounds .",
