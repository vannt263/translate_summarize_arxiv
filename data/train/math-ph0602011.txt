    "the main purpose of this note is to discuss how the existence of a regular lagrangian description @xmath2 on the tangent bundle @xmath0 of some configuration space @xmath1 , can allow , under suitable assumptions that will be discussed shortly below , for the  dynamical \" construction of a linear structure on @xmath0 that can be considered as  adapted \" to the given dynamical system . if and when this is possible , one obtains a new action of the group @xmath3 @xmath4 on @xmath0 and , as will be shown , the lagrangian two - form @xmath5 can be put explicitly in canonical darboux form .",
    "one can then follow the weyl procedure @xcite to quantize the dynamics , by realizing the associated weyl system on the hilbert space of square - integrable functions on a suitable lagrangian submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that many dynamical systems admit genuinely alternative lagrangian descriptions @xcite poses an interesting question , namely : assume that a given dynamical system admits alternative lagrangian descriptions with more than one regular lagrangian . according to what has been outlined above",
    ", one will possibly obtain different actions ( realizations ) of the group @xmath3 on @xmath0 that in general will not be linearly related .",
    "then , it will be possible to quantize   la `` weyl the system in two different ways , thereby obtaining different hilbert space structures on spaces of square - integrable functions on different lagrangian submanifolds ( actually what appears as a lagrangian submanifold in one scheme need not be such in the other .",
    "moreover , the lebesgue measures will be different in the two cases ) .",
    "the occurrence of this situation seems then to offer the possibility of , so - to - speak,''evading \" the von neumann theorem @xcite and this is one of the topics to be discussed in this note .    before embarking in the general discussion ,",
    "we recall here some known facts about the possibility of defining alternative ( i.e. not linearly related ) linear structures on a vector space and/or of using the linear structure of a vector space to endow with a linear structure manifolds that are related to the given vector space .",
    "let @xmath6 be a ( real or complex ) linear vector space .",
    "a ( not necessarily linear ) diffeomorphism:@xmath7 with @xmath8  a manifold  ( possibly @xmath9 ) allows us to `` import '' a linear structure from @xmath6 to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath9 , we can define an alternative linear structure on @xmath6 itself .",
    "to do so , we proceed by defining :    * addition of @xmath10 as:@xmath11 * multiplication by a scalar @xmath12 or @xmath13 of @xmath14 as : @xmath15    these operations have all the usual properties of addition and multiplication by a scalar . in particular : @xmath16 and:@xmath17 indeed , e.g.:@xmath18 which proves ( [ property3 ] ) , and similarly for ( [ property4 ] ) .",

    "therefore , in the framework of the new linear structure , it makes sense to consider the mapping:@xmath21 via:@xmath22 i.e.:@xmath23    property  ( [ property3 ] ) ensures that:@xmath24 i.e. that ( [ dilation ] ) is indeed a one - parameter group .",

    "other simple examples are described in the appendix .",
    "* as a first example , consider @xmath34 with coordinates @xmath35 and the standard symplectic form @xmath36 .",
    "the linear structure is defined by the dilation ( liouville ) field:@xmath37 and is such that:@xmath38 and : @xmath39 .",
    "another relevant structure that can be  constructed is the complex structure , that is defined by the @xmath40 tensor field:@xmath41 which satisfies @xmath42 ( the identity ) and , being constant , has a vanishing nijenhuis tensor @xcite :  @xmath43 .",
