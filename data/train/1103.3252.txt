    "the subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are generally known to be core - helium - burning stars with inert hydrogen - dominated envelopes of very low mass .",
    "this composition places them on the hot extension of the horizontal branch , the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their low - mass envelopes prevent them from reaching a second giant stage , and instead , after their core helium is exhausted , they expand only briefly , never exceeding more than about a third of a solar radius , before contracting and passing on towards higher effective temperatures and gravities .",
    "thus , an sdb star evolves into the hotter sdo population before reaching degeneracy and the associated white dwarf ( wd ) cooling track @xcite .    while the future evolution of sdb stars is unproblematic , exactly how they lose their envelopes during their first red giant ( rgb ) stage is more complicated .",
    "if the star has a close low - mass companion , mass transfer on the tip of the rgb will quickly pull it into the envelope . as friction transfers angular momentum from the orbit to the envelope",
    ", it will spin up and be ejected from the system .",
    "if the core has become massive enough for helium to ignite ( @xmath70.47@xmath8 ) , the result will be a very close sdb+dm system .",
    "these binaries have spectacular reflection effects , and a total of 14 such objects are described in the literature ; 13 are listed in @xcite and the most recent one in @xcite .",
    "while such sdb+dm binaries make out only a tiny fraction of the total sdb population , cases where the companion responsible for ejecting the envelope is a low - mass wd , appear to be much more common .",
    "@xcite found that 21 of 36 stars in their radial velocity study are in short period systems , most likely with wd companions .",
    "if the companion is more massive than the subdwarf ( at least at the end of mass transfer ) , the orbit will have expanded to more than a hundred days .",
    "such orbits are hard to measure , but the companion is easily detectable spectroscopically or from infrared excess .",
    "@xcite found that more than a third of their sdb sample show the spectroscopic signature of main sequence companions , while @xcite , using 2mass  photometry , inferred that about half of the sdbs in the field are likely to be of this type .",
    "thus , the vast majority of sdb stars in the field must be in binary systems .",
    "however , a few pulsating sdbs have been studied in such detail that any companion close enough to have interacted during the rgb stage can be ruled out .",
    "a possible explanation for such single sdb stars can be the merger of two low - mass wds .",
    "these three scenarios are all investigated in detail in the binary population study of @xcite .",
    "they find that while the first two scenarios must have sdbs with masses close to the he - flash mass of 0.47@xmath8 , the merger scenario can produce sdbs with a broad distribution of masses ranging from 0.4 to 0.7@xmath8 .",
    "while most sdb stars form a band in the @xmath0@xmath2  diagram that is consistent with a mass close to the canonical 0.47@xmath8 , and various envelope thicknesses up to the h - burning limit , a few exceptions are found .",
    "one such is , discovered to be a high amplitude sdb pulsator by @xcite .",
    "a multi - site campaign devoted to this pulsator @xcite found more than fifty pulsation frequencies in the range 365529s , which now defines the long - period edge for the v361hya group of short - period sdb variables ( sdbvs ) .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy of v338ser was analysed by @xcite , and most recently @xcite performed high - resolution time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "its unusually low gravity was discussed briefly by @xcite , proposing that it may be a core - he - burning ehb star with a mass larger than the canonical , rather than a shell - he - burning post - ehb star as suggested by @xcite .",
    "asteroseismic solutions supporting this hypothesis were recently presented by @xcite , implying a mass of 0.76@xmath8 , and an envelope mass fraction of 0.2% .    since v338ser remained a unique object in spite of a decade of searches for v361hya pulsators , we have recently been paying particular attention to candidates in this low - gravity region . here",
    "we present the discovery of pulsations in j20136 + 0928(figure  [ fig : lc_all ] ) , which has an even lower surface gravity than v338ser , and the lowest of any sdb pulsator found to date .",
    "since 2008 we have observed uv - excess targets selected based on uv photometry from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) satellite @xcite . an estimate based on targets with nuv@xmath914.0 and fuv ",
    "b@xmath9 + 0.5 is that only about two - thirds were already cataloged .",
    "uv - excess objects in this cut include a host of interesting compact stars .",
    "all types of pulsating wds and hot subdwarf stars are included , as are most types of cataclysmic variables and planetary nebula nuclei .",
    "our first cut based on galex  data release 4 ( gr4 ) , contained 649 objects of which only about 400 had even approximate classes in the literature .",
    "we started observing targets from this list as a backup programme for various observing runs , and have by now mostly completed the sample .",
    "full details of this survey will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a similar survey is described by @xcite .",
    "as we have accumulated spectroscopic observations , new sdbv candidates have entered our observing lists for photometric follow - up , and new discoveries are emerging .",
    "the first result was the discovery of pulsations in , recently presented by @xcite , and establishing it as a being a high - amplitude member of the rare dwlyn ( hybrid ) type of sdbvs .",
    "the object presented here appears in galex  data release 6 ( gr6 ) as galex j201337.6 + 092801 , with uv magnitudes fuv=12.263(3 ) , nuv=13.079(3 ) .",
    "photographic magnitudes for this star from the nomad  database are @xmath4=12.01 , @xmath10=12.22 , @xmath11=12.34 , and from the 2massnear - ir survey ; @xmath12=13.00 , @xmath13=13.11 , @xmath14=13.23 .",
    "the magnitudes are all perfectly consistent with an sdb star that has no main sequence companion .",
    "j20136 + 0928  also appears in the tycho-2 catalog as tyc 1077 - 218 - 1 , where it has @xmath4=12.16 , @xmath10=11.78 .",
    "the nomad  database also lists the target with a small but significant proper motion ( @xmath15,@xmath16=12.1,2.8 mas / yr ) .",
    "the target was observed spectroscopically during a run at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) at observatorio roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma ( spain ) .",
    "after the observing run we processed all the data and extracted the spectra with iraf in the regular way .",
    "we fitted the hot subdwarfs using the pure h+he lte model grids of @xcite , and we show the resulting fit for j20136 + 0928  in figure  [ fig : tgfit ] .",
    "the formal fitting errors ( shown on the figure ) do not account for systematic effects inherent in the models , so we generously increase the errors by a factor five when stating @xmath0=32100@xmath11000 , @xmath2=5.15@xmath10.20 , and @xmath3=2.8@xmath10.2 .",
    "note that the typical shift of when going from lte to nlte models is @xmath7 + 1000k , and can become larger when metalicity effects are taken into account ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the low surface gravity of this object is clear .",
    "the discovery run was made on october 6 , 2010 with the 1.2-m mercator telescope , sited just next to the int .",
    "although the conditions were poor , the main period of @xmath7520s was clearly seen , and recognised to be longer than normal for a v361hya star . since it was already clear from the spectroscopy that the gravity of the target was unusually low , the connection with v338ser was immediately made , and we urgently proceeded to confirm the discovery . as the target was already setting early in the night , we pooled observing time at several telescopes in order to collect enough photometry for a frequency analysis .",
    "photometric data were collected at three different sites within one month of the discovery run . at the mercator telescope we used the merope ccd camera , which was recently upgraded with a new e2v frame transfer ccd with 2048@xmath173074 illuminated pixels @xcite .",
    "the observations were done with a geneva-@xmath4 filter ( @xmath18=4201@xmath1286 ) , and a cadence period of @xmath715 sec . with the 0.4-m telescope at baker observatory ( missouri , usa ) we used a photometrics rs-1340 ccd with a bg40 filter ( @xmath18=4750@xmath11500 ) , and a cadence of @xmath730s .",
    "we also obtained three consecutive nights with the 0.84-m telescope at san pedro mrtir ( spm ) observatory in mexico .",
    "the ccd camera is equipped with an e2v 4240 ccd , and we used a bessel-@xmath4 filter ( @xmath18=4350@xmath1980 ) , and a cadence of 38s .",
    "the light curves are all shown in figure  [ fig : lc_all ] , with the discovery run on top .",
    "poor weather at mercator left us unable to collect a significant amount of data at our prime site .",
    "differential photometry was made with respect to the sum of three or four of the brightest reference stars found within the field of view of the ccds .",
    "most of this reference signal comes from tyc 1077 - 402 - 1 , about 1.7 sw of the target , which is comparable in brightness to j20136 + 0928 .",
    "the five bottom panels are consecutive nights , but the coverage is rather poor due to the target only being visible for a few hours before setting . on both october 27 and 28 , there was a few hours of overlap between data from baker and spm .",
    "this allowed us to confirm that there is no significant difference in amplitude between observations made with the two telescopes , in spite of a significantly broader bandpass at baker .",
    "we only use the last five nights for the frequency analysis described in the next section .",
    ".list of frequencies [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]      + * notes.*phases are times of maxima since hjd 2455495.5 .",
    "+ frequencies with large uncertainties are identified with @xmath19 .",
    "the fourier transform ( ft ) of all runs longer than 1h is far too short to resolve the complexity of the frequency spectrum displayed by j20136 + 0928 . joining the five consecutive nights and taking the ft of",
    "the combined dataset produces the complex frequency spectrum with strong 1-day aliasing shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ft_pw ] .",
    "the tools used for the frequency determination were developed particularly for multi - site data , and are described in @xcite .",
    "we proceed to prewhiten the most significant well - separated peaks , five or six at a time , until we reach a level of 0.71mma ( straight line in the bottom panel of the same figure ) .",
    "this level is 4.2 times the noise level when computed in the high - frequency region where no pulsational power is seen ( although we do detect the drive frequency of some of our telescopes ) , and 3.7 times the mean residual level of the 1000 to 3000@xmath20  region shown in the last panel . in each step",
    "the most significant peaks are used as input for a non - linear least - squares fitting procedure , and all 16 frequencies , amplitudes and phases are left free in the final step .",
    "several frequencies close to the most significant peaks do not converge to reliable values , and we consider these as uncertain ( ids labeled @xmath19 in table  [ tbl : freqs ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this is due to the poor coverage of our data , or caused by real amplitude variability of the target .",
    "concern can also be raised about some frequencies that are barely resolved ( _ e.g. _ @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "a new , bright sdbv with an exceptionally low gravity has been found in a sample of uv - excess stars identified from galex  photometry . in figure",
    "[ fig : tgplot ] we show its position with respect to v338ser and the bulk of the sdb population , which falls between the zero and terminal age ehb lines .",
    "j20136 + 0928  is located close to minimum @xmath2  during the post - ehb stage of the uppermost evolutionary track , which corresponds to a 0.470@xmath8  helium burning star with an h - envelope mass of 0.004@xmath8 .",
    "evolutionary models of more massive ehb stars are not shown , but can be found in @xcite , from which one may infer that models with a mass of @xmath70.7@xmath8  and an envelope of @xmath70.01@xmath23   would approximate the position of j20136 + 0928  reasonably well . as mentioned in the introduction , such an overmassive ehb star can not form through the regular binary mass - transfer scenarios that are responsible for producing the bulk of the ehb stars , but can form through the merger of two helium core wds .",
    "theoretical models for these scenarios , combined with future observational efforts , may allow us to determine the origins of both v338ser and j20136 + 0928 .",
    "this discovery brings the total number of short period sdbv stars ( both v361hya and hybrid dwlyn stars ) up to 52 ( 49 are summarised in @xcite , one was recently discovered in the field of the _ kepler _ spacecraft by @xcite , and the last one by @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of pulsations in a star with such a low gravity as j20136 + 0928  is well explained by the classical @xmath24 mechanism for pulsations in sdbvs @xcite .",
    "however , the exceptionally low gravity of j20136 + 0928  is surprising in evolutionary terms , and the presence of pulsations allows the mass and internal structure to be explored .",
    "the encouraging brightness of j20136 + 0928  makes it an excellent target for time - resolved spectroscopy studies , and arranging a multi - site campaign with small telescopes when the target is visible throughout the night will be a priority for the coming season . by accurately determining the frequencies present in the star , asteroseismology will be able to reliably determine its mass and internal structure , and allow us to determine the most likely evolutionary origins of this object .",
