    "one of the fundamental questions of astronomy is to determine how typical the solar system is .",
    "if earth - like planets occur frequently , then life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy . however , the search for extra - terrestrial planetary systems is extremely difficult , and is most often approached indirectly .",
    "massive planets introduce changes in the observed velocities of their stars ( the doppler technique ) , and so far ten objects with minimum masses up to 10 m(jupiter ) have been detected in this way ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy et al .",
    "earth - like planets may be observable during stellar transits ; by ground and space - borne coronographs ; or have atmospheric signatures different from the stellar photospheres , effects which could be detectable in the future ( fischer & pfau 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative is to search for young systems where planets are still forming from circumstellar material .",
    "molecular gas has been detected around a few main - sequence stars , most of which are young objects ( zuckerman , forveille & kastner 1995 ; dent et al .",
    "dust was detected around somewhat older main - sequence stars by iras ( aumann et al . 1984 ) , including the nearby systems vega and fomalhaut .",
    "these stars have ages @xmath6 years , which lie at the end of the era when rocky planets are expected to form . recently ,",
    "submillimetre wavelength images of these stars ( holland et al .",
    "1998a ) showed that fomalhaut has a dust ring with a central cavity , thus accumulation into planetesimals may have occurred .",
    "such cavities have also been seen around @xmath7 pic and hr4796a , at ages of only @xmath8 years ( smith & terrile 1984 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; koerner et al . 1998 ) .",
    "unexpected features are now emerging , including secondary dust spots around vega and @xmath7 pic ( holland et al .",
    "1998a ) , and these have yet to be explained by planet formation theories .",
    "so far , there is little evidence for analogues of the solar system around stars of spectral type similar to the sun .",
    "the doppler technique is biased towards massive planets close to their stars ( current detections range out to 2.5 au ) , so it is difficult to find gas giants at the distances of jupiter and beyond .",
    "submillimetre imaging can reveal much lower orbiting masses of dust , below 1 m@xmath3 , but this emission is brightest when the dust is heated by luminous stars .",
    "vega , fomalhaut and @xmath7 pic are all luminous a - type stars , with much shorter lifetimes than the sun , so that any planets would be short - lived .",
    "however , some g and k type stars detected by iras are suited to ground - based follow - up ; in particular 5 objects within 25 pc have significant 60 and 100 @xmath1 excesses ( aumann 1988 ) . here",
    "we present the first image of dust around a low - mass main - sequence star  @xmath0 eridani ( hr 1084 ) , a k2v ( 0.8  m@xmath4 ) star located only 3.22 pc from the sun .",
    "iras partially resolved a warm dusty region ( gillett 1986 ) , which is now shown to be a ring similar in scale to the kuiper belt . the age of @xmath0 eri is estimated at @xmath9 1 gyr ( soderblom & dppen 1989 ) , so it may represent a young analogue to the solar system .",
    "the observations were made with the new submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) ( holland et al .",
    "1998b ) at the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the data were obtained between august 1997 and february 1998 , using the scuba ` jiggle - map ' observing mode ( jenness , lightfoot & holland 1998 ) .",
    "fully - sampled maps were generated at 3@xmath10 sampling , with an on - source integration time of 12.1 hours .",
    "although scuba operates at 450 and 850 @xmath1 simultaneously , this paper concentrates mainly on the 850 @xmath1 data , since observing conditions were generally poor at 450 @xmath1 .",
    "zenith atmospheric opacities at 850 @xmath1 ranged from 0.12 to 0.35 ( only 30 % of these data had 450 @xmath1 opacities of @xmath11  1 ) and calibration data were obtained from mars and uranus .",
    "pointing accuracy was 2@xmath10 , small compared to the beam size of 15@xmath10 at 850 @xmath1 ( full - width at half maximum ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the scuba user reduction facility ( jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) , and are rebinned in an ra - dec . frame with 2@xmath10 cells .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the 850 @xmath1 map of @xmath0 eri is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the data have been smoothed with a 8@xmath10 point - spread function , resulting in a peak signal - to - noise per beam of 10 .",
    "photospheric emission of 1.7 @xmath12 0.2 mjy has also been subtracted in the image .",
    "the photospheric flux was estimated by independent extrapolations using 2.2 and 3.4 @xmath1 data ( carter 1990 ) and the iras 12 @xmath1 flux ( corrected for an effective temperature of 5000 k ) .",
    "dust emission around @xmath0 eri was also tentatively detected at 450 @xmath1 ( table [ thetable ] ) .",
    "lccll 850 & 40 @xmath12 3 & 1.7 @xmath12 0.2 & mjy & r @xmath9 35@xmath10 from star 450 & 185 @xmath12 103 & 6 @xmath12 1 & mjy & r @xmath9 35@xmath10 from star 100 & 1.78 & 0.11 & jy & iras 60 & 1.34 & 0.29 & jy & iras 25 & 0.27 & 1.63 & jy & iras 12 &  & 6.66 & jy & iras 3.4 &  & 70.3 & jy & saao 2.2 &  & 139.7 & jy & saao 1300 & ( @xmath13 724 ) & 0.7 & mjy & photometry , 1124@xmath10 beams [ thetable ]    the image shows extended flux around the star out to about 35@xmath10 radius .",
    "the rest of the field of view is largely featureless , but one other source is seen approximately 60@xmath10 east of @xmath0 eri .",
    "this has a total flux of about 8 mjy , and could be a distant galaxy ( e.g. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) .",
    "additionally , a 2.2 @xmath1 image obtained with the keck 10 m telescope shows three more background objects within 50@xmath10 of the star , but none of these coincide with the submillimetre peaks .",
    "we conclude that background sources are not significantly affecting the brightness distribution seen around @xmath0 eri at 850 @xmath1 .",
    "iras data at 60 @xmath1 have shown a more compact dusty structure , with a half - power radius of 811@xmath10 ( aumann 1991 ; gillett 1986 ) , and temperatures ranging from 50 k up to 370 k for some grains near the star .",
    "the 850 @xmath1 emission extends to about 35@xmath10 from @xmath0 eri , and only @xmath5  9  % of it comes from the iras source area .",
    "we also find an 850/450 @xmath1 flux ratio of 4.6 @xmath12 2.6 ( table [ thetable ] ) , corresponding to a dust opacity index @xmath14 .",
    "this implies large grains ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) which are efficient emitters and at the observed distances from @xmath0 eri will be at about 30 k ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "these results are discussed further below , and the fluxes from the millimetre to the infrared are listed in table [ thetable ] .",
    "a search was also made for a molecular gas component around @xmath0 eri .",
    "low limits had previously been set by a search for co j=10 emission ( walker & wolstencroft 1988 ) , using a large telescope beam that included all the figure [ fig1 ] emission region .",
    "more recently , dent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found no co j=32 emission towards @xmath0 eri , but the 14@xmath10 jcmt beam was only sensitive to the low - flux region near the star ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we therefore made a complementary search for co j=21 emission , with a 21@xmath10 beam centred 3@xmath10 south of the bright peak in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "an upper limit of 25 mk was measured in a 1 km s@xmath15 spectral bin , which for a thermalised gas excitation temperature of about 30 k corresponds to a co column density of @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "co is subject to photo - dissociation by interstellar uv radiation , but accounting for this with standard models ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) , the approximate column density of h@xmath18 molecules is @xmath19 @xmath17 ( a@xmath20 0.2 ) .",
    "the total mass of gas and dust around @xmath0 eri is estimated at less than an earth mass . for the dust component alone",
    ", we find 0.0050.02 m@xmath3 ( 1.56 @xmath21 m@xmath22 ) , assuming t@xmath23 of 30 k and an absorption coefficient @xmath24 between 1.7 and 0.4 @xmath25 g@xmath15 .",
    "the lower value of @xmath24 is suggested by models of large , icy grains ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) , while the higher estimate has been used for previous observations of vega - type stars ( e.g. holland et al .",
    "however , very large grains could dominate the mass while adding little emission , so both mass estimates are lower limits .",
    "the co upper limit corresponds to @xmath9 0.4 m@xmath3 of molecular gas , when extrapolated over the area of dust emission above half - maximum brightness .",
    "the 850 @xmath1 image shows extended emission , which most resembles a ring of dust around the star .",
    "the emission peaks at a radius of 18@xmath10 ( @xmath5 60 au ) , and substantially reduced emission is seen at about 30 au .",
    "this ring - like morphology was previously suspected from single - beam observations at 1.3 mm , where flux variations were found with different beam sizes ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ) , but is only now seen directly .",
    "the image also shows some surprising asymmetries and bright peaks , which are discussed further below .",
    "[ fig2 ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows the azimuthally averaged radial profile calculated from the 850 @xmath1 map .",
    "there is a difference of a factor of two between the flux densities of the ring ( r = 18@xmath10 ) and the cavity minimum ( r @xmath5 8@xmath10 ) .",
    "the cavity region out to this distance has only 6 % of the total integrated flux .",
    "there is an apparent rise in flux density within r = 4.5@xmath10 , which in the unsmoothed data appears to correspond to a small peak south of the star .",
    "however , the signal level in this region is uncertain , as it includes less than 10 map pixels .",
    "the most probable explanation for the ring - like structure is a young analogue of the kuiper belt .",
    "the central deficit of emission suggests accumulation of dust into planetesimals ( which emit much less per unit mass than individual grains ) .",
    "the @xmath0 eri system could thus be analogous to the young solar system , seen when planet formation is ongoing or complete , but some dust is still present at all radii out to about 36@xmath10 ( 115 au ) .",
    "the age of the star is not well - defined , but can be estimated from the level of chromospheric activity .",
    "an age relation for dwarf stars is discussed by soderblom , duncan & johnson ( 1991 ) and their results for @xmath0 eri ( soderblom & dppen 1989 ) suggest an age of @xmath5 0.51.0 gyr . at this age ,",
    "a partially - cleared but still dusty system is seen as expected .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows the locations of the solar outer planets and the kuiper belt , sketched below the dust profile of @xmath0 eri .",
    "the least dust emission is seen at the equivalent of uranus and neptune s orbits , while the ring peaks at about 60 au , well within the kuiper belt zone .",
    "since the 850 @xmath1 image is broadened by the beam size of 15@xmath10 , the dust ring must in fact be narrower than it appears in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the observed width at half - maximum is from radii of 7.5@xmath10 to 27@xmath10 , which when deconvolved from the beam imply half - maximum points at about 11@xmath10 and 23@xmath10 , or 3575 au .",
    "this is similar to our solar system , as the kuiper belt has an inferred declining density outwards from r @xmath5 32 au ( jewitt & luu 1995 ) , with much of the population within 100 au .",
    "iras observations suggested considerable emission from the cavity region , with warm grains ( 50370 k ) inside 811@xmath10 radius ( aumann 1991 ; gillett 1986 ) . at 850 @xmath1",
    ", this inner region contributes only @xmath2  9  % of the flux , and for the higher t@xmath23 , @xmath11 5  % of the overall mass .",
    "thus there is a genuine cavity within the ring , although it does contain some grains .",
    "in fact , the inner region is much dustier than the sun s zodaical belt , by two to three orders of magnitude ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ) .",
    "this persistence of central material around @xmath0 eri at 0.51.0 gyr is consistent with the history of the solar system , where the earth was heavily bombarded by asteroids up to about 0.6 gyr ( maher & stevenson 1988 ) .",
    "other mechanisms can reduce the amount of dust emission near a star , including grain mantle sublimation or radiation - grain drag ( poynting - robertson effect ) .",
    "however , ice mantles should persist to within a few au of @xmath0  eri , since the giant planets in the solar system are believed to have formed around rock and ice cores , and the luminosity of @xmath0 eri is only about 0.33 l@xmath22 ( soderblom & dppen 1989 ) . for p - r drag , grains @xmath2 1 mm in diameter would have been cleared only to radii of about 15 au ( jura 1990 ) , even if the star is as old as 1 gyr .",
    "thus it would be difficult to reproduce clearing out to the observed 35 au .",
    "also , p - r drag naturally produces a 1/r density distribution as small grains spiral in towards the star , and this is not seen .",
    "thus it appears unlikely that sublimation of grain mantles or radiation - grain drag can explain the reduced emission close to @xmath0 eri .",
    "the total mass of the @xmath0 eri ring depends on the presence of gas , but is at least @xmath2 0.01 m@xmath3 , and possibly as high as 0.4 m@xmath3 .",
    "this range encompasses the present - day mass of comets in the kuiper belt , @xmath5 0.040.3 m@xmath3 between 30 and 100 au ( backman , dasgupta & stencel 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 eri circumstellar ring could therefore be evolving into a kuiper belt analogue of icy cometary bodies .",
    "comets may form in only a few 10@xmath26 years ( weidenschilling 1997 ) , but the time to accrete and/or disperse all the dust is likely to be @xmath27 years , the period estimated to form large kuiper belt objects ( kenyon & luu 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 eri ring system appears close to face - on , as the morphology is roughly circular ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the major : minor axis ratio is @xmath2 1.1 ( 66 and 60@xmath10 diameters at the 3@xmath28 level ) , implying an inclination to the plane of the sky of i @xmath2 25@xmath29 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the orientation deduced for the stellar pole from optical line data , of i  @xmath5  30 @xmath12 15@xmath29 ( saar & osten 1997 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the dust ring is aligned with the stellar equator .",
    "a surprising result is the non - uniformity of the ring ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the bright peak seen at dra , ddec .",
    "= ( + 19@xmath10,7@xmath10 ) has a flux density of 6.9 mjy in a 15@xmath10 beam area , compared to the region on the opposite side of the star where the flux density is only 3.5 mjy per beam , a difference of five times the rms noise .",
    "the bright peak is a real feature ( identified in 13 out of 16 of the individual maps ) .",
    "the fainter peaks north - east and south - west of the star are less certain , as they were identified in only half of the individual maps .",
    "an enhancement of dust density might represent the wake of a planet orbiting within the ring .",
    "dust can become trapped in resonant orbits with a planet , and for example , dermott et al . (",
    "1994 ) found that up to 20 % of the zodiacal dust near the earth is trapped to form a dust condensation , seen in iras data .",
    "alternatively , a planet orbiting just inside the @xmath0 eri ring could cause transient features , similar to the manner in which neptune ` erodes ' the inner edge of the kuiper belt ( jewitt & luu 1995 ) .",
    "asymmetries can also be produced when the peculiar velocity of the star with respect to the interstellar medium causes interstellar grains to stream into the disk , and erosion effects produce a brightness change on one side ( artymowicz & clampin 1997 ) .",
    "this process is likely to be effective only at very large radii ( hundreds of au ) .",
    "finally , backman & paresce ( 1993 ) have pointed out that planetesimal collision rates are low at a few tens of au , thus recent collisions will produce discontinuous features .",
    "the flux enhancement at ( + 19@xmath10,7@xmath10 ) is 2.6 mjy , or the amount of dust that would be produced by the destruction of a body with 1555  % of the mass of pluto ( for t@xmath23 = 30 k , @xmath24 = 1.70.4 @xmath17 g@xmath15 ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely that we would observe such a major collision , as the remnants would disperse within a few orbital periods ( 500 years at 60 au ) , or a fraction @xmath11  10 @xmath30 of the age of the system .",
    "a dust ring has been detected around @xmath0 eri with a mass and radius similar to the kuiper belt .",
    "dust appears to be partially cleared inside the ring , consistent with accumulation into planetesimals",
    ". other mechanisms of producing decreased dust emission can not be definitively ruled out , but poynting - robertson drag and grain mantle sublimation appear unlikely to produce such a cavity .",
    "an inhomogeneity in the ring suggests the presence of a large orbiting body , either within the ring or just inside it .",
    "this corresponds to an orbit similar to neptune s , or up to twice as large .",
    "any planet formation around @xmath0 eri is probably complete , as the stellar age is around 0.51.0 gyr , and earth - like planets are believed to form within 0.1 gyr ( gas giants on shorter timescales ) .",
    "no direct evidence has as yet been found for planets around @xmath0 eri .",
    "indications of a 10-year variation in radial velocity ( walker et al .",
    "1995 ) are now suspected to be a multiple of a 5 year period in changes in the stellar photosphere ( gray & baliunas 1995 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the suspected radial velocity was @xmath2 15 m s@xmath15 , and more recent searches ( g. marcy , priv . comm . )",
    "find no such effect , with errors of 1015 m s@xmath15 over a 10 year period .",
    "however , the radial velocities will be reduced because the @xmath0 eri system is seen almost face - on , making it harder to detect jovians by this method .",
    "the new submillimetre image suggests that the @xmath0 eri system is a strong candidate for an analogue of the young solar system , and that renewed planetary searches by various techniques could be rewarding .",

    "<S> @xmath0 eri is a main - sequence star of type k2v ( 0.8 m@xmath4 ) with an estimated age of 0.51.0 gyr , so this interpretation is consistent with the early history of the solar system where heavy bombardment occurred up to @xmath5  0.6 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> an unexpected discovery is substructure within the ring , and these asymmetries could be due to perturbations by planets . </S>"
