    "the maunder minimum and several ancient periods from solar proxy - data suggest that the sun exhibits quasi - periodic or intermittent behavior @xcite . owing to changes in magnetic activity , many aspects of the solar wind change over a solar cycle , including the speed , the density , the dynamic pressure , the composition , and the temperature @xcite .    in this paper , we present the analysis of solar wind velocity data during the solar activity cycle @xmath0 .",
