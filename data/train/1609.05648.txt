    "double-@xmath0 decay is currently one of the most studied processes both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is a rare weak - interaction process of second - order taking place in cases where single @xmath0 decay is energetically forbidden or strongly suppressed .",
    "it has a deep impact in neutrino physics because the neutrino properties are directly involved in the neutrinoless mode of the decay ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "this decay mode , not yet observed , violates lepton - number conservation and its existence would be an evidence of the majorana nature of the neutrino , providing a measurement of its absolute mass scale . obviously , to extract a reliable estimate of the neutrino mass , the nuclear structure component of the process must be determined accurately . on the other hand , the double-@xmath0 decay with emission of two neutrinos ( @xmath7 )",
    "is perfectly allowed by the standard model and it has been observed experimentally in several nuclei with typical half - lives of @xmath8 years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus , to test the reliability of the nuclear structure calculations involved in the @xmath6 process , one checks first the ability of the nuclear models to reproduce the experimental information available about the measured half - lives for the @xmath7 process . although the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) involved in both processes are not the same , they exhibit some similarities .",
    "in particular , the two processes connect the same initial and final nuclear ground states and share common intermediate @xmath9 states .",
    "therefore , reproducing the @xmath7 nmes is a requirement for any nuclear structure model aiming to describe the neutrinoless mode .",
    "different theoretical approaches have been used in the past to study the @xmath7 nmes .",
    "most of them belong to the categories of the interacting shell model @xcite , proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite , projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov @xcite , and interacting boson model @xcite .    in this work we focus on the qrpa type of calculations .",
    "most of these calculations were based originally on a spherical formalism , but the fact that some of the double-@xmath0-decay nuclei are deformed , makes it compulsory to deal with deformed qrpa formalisms @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case of @xmath5nd ( @xmath5sm ) that has received increasing attention in the last years because of the large phase - space factor and relatively short half - life , as well as for the large @xmath10 energy that will reduce the background contamination .",
    "@xmath5nd is currently considered as one of the best candidates to search for the @xmath6 decay in the planned experiments sno+ , supernemo , and dcba .",
    "the experimental information to constrain the calculations is not limited to the @xmath7 nmes extracted from the measured half - lives .",
    "we have also experimental information on the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions of the single branches connecting the initial and final ground states with all the @xmath9 states in the intermediate nucleus .",
    "the gt strength distributions have been measured in both directions from ( p , n ) and ( n , p ) charge - exchange reactions ( cer ) and more recently , from high resolution reactions , such as @xmath11he ) , @xmath12he , t ) , and ( t,@xmath13he ) that allow us to explore in detail the low energy structure of the gt nuclear response in double-@xmath0-decay partners @xcite . in some instances there",
    "is also experimental information on the @xmath14 values of the decay of the intermediate nuclei .",
    "nuclear structure calculations are also constrained by the experimental occupation probabilities of neutrons and protons of the relevant single - particle levels involved in the double-@xmath0-decay process .",
    "in particular , the occupation probabilities of the valence shells @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for neutrons in @xmath1ge and for protons in @xmath1se have been measured in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the implications of these measurements on the double-@xmath0 decay nmes have been studied in refs .",

    "we explore the possibility to describe all the experimental information available on the gt nuclear response within a formalism based on a deformed qrpa approach built on top of a deformed selfconsistent skyrme hartree - fock calculation @xcite .",
    "this information includes global properties about the gt resonance , such as its location and total strength , a more detailed description of the low - lying excitations , and @xmath7-decay nmes .",
    "the study includes the decays @xmath1ge  @xmath17se , @xmath2cd  @xmath18sn , @xmath3te  @xmath19xe , @xmath4te  @xmath20xe , and @xmath5nd  @xmath21sm .",

    "we also discuss on these examples the validity of the single - state dominance ( ssd ) hypothesis @xcite and the extended low - lying - state dominance ( llsd ) that includes the contribution of the low - lying excited states in the intermediate nuclei to account for the double-@xmath0-decay rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] , we present a short introduction to the theoretical approach used in this work to describe the energy distribution of the gt strength . we also present the basic expressions of the @xmath7-decay . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results obtained from our approach , which are compared with the experimental data available .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains a summary and the main conclusions .",
    "the description of the deformed qrpa approach used in this work is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we give only a summary of the method .",
    "we start from a selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation with density - dependent two - body skyrme interactions .",
    "time reversal symmetry and axial deformation are assumed in the calculations @xcite .",
    "most of the results in this work are performed with the skyrme force sly4 @xcite , which is one of the most widely used and successful interactions .",
    "results from other skyrme interactions have been studied elsewhere @xcite to check the sensitivity of the gt nuclear response to the two - body effective interaction .    in our approach , we expand the single - particle wave functions in terms of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator basis in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "this amounts to a basis size of 364 , the total number of independent @xmath24 deformed h.o . states . pairing is included in bcs approximation by solving the corresponding bcs equations for protons and neutrons after each hf iteration . fixed pairing",
    "gap parameters are determined from the experimental mass differences between even and odd nuclei .",
    "besides the selfconsistent hf+bcs solution , we also explore the energy curves , that is , the energy as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath25 , which are obtained from constrained hf+bcs calculations .",
    "the energy curves corresponding to the nuclei studied can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the profiles of the energy curves for @xmath1ge and @xmath1se exhibit two shallow local minima in the prolate and oblate sectors .",
    "these minima are separated by relatively low energy barriers of about 1 mev .",
    "the equilibrium deformation corresponds to @xmath26 in @xmath1ge and @xmath27 in @xmath1se .",
    "we get soft profiles for @xmath2cd with a minimum at @xmath28 and an almost flat curve in @xmath2sn between @xmath29 and @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain almost spherical configurations in the ground states of @xmath3te and @xmath4te .",
    "the energies differ less than 300 kev between quadrupole deformations @xmath30 and @xmath31 . on the other hand , for @xmath3xe and @xmath4xe we get in both cases two energy minima corresponding to prolate and oblate shapes , differing by less than 1 mev , with an energy barrier of about 2 mev .",
    "the ground states correspond in both cases to the prolate shapes with deformations around @xmath32 . for @xmath5nd and @xmath5sm",
    "we obtain two energy minima , oblate and prolate , but with clear prolate ground states in both cases at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we obtain comparable results with other skyrme forces .",
    "the relative energies between the various minima can change somewhat for different skyrme forces @xcite , but the equilibrium deformations are very close to each other changing at most by a few percent .",
    "after the hf+bcs calculation is performed , we introduce separable spin - isospin residual interactions and solve the qrpa equations in the deformed ground - states to get gt strength distributions and @xmath7-decay nmes .",
    "the residual force has both particle - hole ( @xmath35 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath36 ) components .",
    "the repulsive @xmath35 force determines to a large extent the structure of the gt resonance and its location .",
    "its coupling constant @xmath37 is usually taken to reproduce them @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath38 .",
    "the attractive @xmath36 part is basically a proton - neutron pairing interaction .",
    "we also use a separable form @xcite with a coupling constant @xmath39 usually fitted to reproduce the experimental half - lives @xcite .",
    "we use in most of this work a fixed value @xmath40 mev , although we will explore the dependence of the @xmath7 nmes on @xmath39 in the next section .",
    "earlier studies on @xmath5nd and @xmath5sm carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite using a deformed qrpa formalism showed that the results obtained from realistic nucleon - nucleon residual interactions based on the brueckner @xmath41 matrix for the cd - bonn force produce results in agreement with those obtained from schematic separable forces similar to those used here .",
    "the qrpa equations are solved following the lines described in refs .",
    "the method we use is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the proton - neutron qrpa phonon operator    @xmath42\\ , ,   \\label{phon}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "@xmath45 labels the rpa excited state and its corresponding excitation energy , and @xmath46 are the forward and backward phonon amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the solution of the qrpa equations are obtained by solving first a dispersion relation @xcite , which is of fourth order in the excitation energies @xmath47 .",
    "the gt transition amplitudes connecting the qrpa ground state @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) to one phonon states @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are given in the intrinsic frame by    @xmath52    where    @xmath53    @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are the bcs occupation amplitudes for neutrons and protons .",
    "once the intrinsic amplitudes are calculated , the gt strength @xmath56(gt ) in the laboratory frame for a transition @xmath57 can be obtained as    @xmath58 \\ , .",
    "\\label{bgt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to obtain this expression we have used the bohr and mottelson factorization @xcite to express the initial and final nuclear states in the laboratory system in terms of the intrinsic states . a quenching factor , @xmath59 , is applied to the weak axial - vector coupling constant and included in the calculations .",
    "the physical reasons for this quenching have been studied elsewhere @xcite and are related to the role of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , absent in the usual theoretical models , and to the limitations of model space , many - nucleon configurations , and deep correlations missing in these calculations .",
    "the implications of this quenching on the description of single-@xmath0 and double-@xmath0-decay observables have been considered in several works @xcite , where both the effective value of @xmath60 and the coupling strength of the residual interaction in the @xmath36 channel are considered free parameters of the calculation .",
    "it is found that very strong quenching values are needed to reproduce simultaneously the observations corresponding to the @xmath7 half - lives and to the single-@xmath0 decay branches .",
    "one should note however , that the qrpa calculations that require a strong quenching to fit the @xmath7 nmes were performed within a spherical formalism neglecting possible effects from deformation degrees of freedom . because the main effect of deformation is a reduction of the nmes , deformed qrpa calculations shall demand less quenching to fit the experiment .",

    "this is called low - lying - single - state dominance @xcite and can be studied in all @xmath7 nuclei . from the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we can not establish clear evidences for ssd hypothesis from our calculations . nevertheless , it is also worth mentioning that our nmes calculated up to 5 mev , already account for most of the total nme calculated up to 20 mev .",
    "this results agrees qualitatively with other results obtained in different qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "the ssd hypothesis can be tested experimentally in the decays of @xmath2cd and @xmath3te where the intermediate nuclei have @xmath78 ground states . by measuring the two decay branches of @xmath2 in and @xmath3i , the @xmath14 values of the ground state to ground state ( @xmath108 ) can be extracted . from these values",
    "one can obtain the gt strength ,    @xmath109    with a=6289 s @xcite .",
    "finally the @xmath7 nme within ssd is evaluated as @xmath110 ^{1/2 } } { ( q_{\\beta^- } + q_{\\rm ec})/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\frac{6a}{\\left [ ft_{\\rm ec}\\right ] ^{1/2 } \\left [ ft_{\\beta^-}\\right ] ^{1/2 }   g_a^2(q_{\\beta^- } + q_{\\rm ec})}\\ , .",
    "\\label{dgt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can also determine the @xmath7 nme running sums using the experimental @xmath56(gt ) extracted from cers and using the same phases for the matrix elements if one can establish a one - to - one correspondence between the intermediate states reached from parent and daughter .",
    "then , one can construct the @xmath7 nmes from the measured gt strengths and energies in the cers in the parent and daughter partners ,    @xmath111 ^{1/2 } } { e_m+(q_{\\beta^- } + q_{\\rm ec})/2}\\ , ,   \\label{dgtlls}\\ ] ]    where @xmath112 is the excitation energy of the @xmath113th @xmath78 state relative to the ground state of the intermediate nucleus .",
    "experimental @xmath7 nmes running sums have been determined along this line using experimental @xmath114 from cers in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1ge , in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath2cd , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath5nd . in the case of @xmath23te",
    "they have not been determined because of the lack of data in the ( n , p ) direction .",
    "they can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] under the label exp@xmath115 .    in the case of @xmath1ge ,",
    "the @xmath7 nmes are constructed by combining the gt@xmath104 data from @xmath1ge(@xmath13he , t)@xmath1as @xcite with those for gt@xmath105 transitions from @xmath1se(d,@xmath22he)@xmath1as @xcite",
    ". a large fragmentation of the gt@xmath116 strength was found in the experiment , not only at high excitation energies , but also at low excitation energy , which is rather unusual .",
    "in addition , a lack of correlation between the gt excitation energies from the two different branches was also observed .",
    "thus , for the evaluation of the @xmath7 nmes a one - to - one connection between the @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 ) transitions leading to the excited state in the intermediate nucleus needs to be established .",
    "in particular , since the spectra from the two cer experiments had rather different energy resolutions , the strength was accumulated in similar bins to evaluate the @xmath7 nmes @xcite .",
    "the summed matrix element amounted to 0.186 mev@xmath70 up to an excitation energy of 2.22 mev .    in the case of @xmath2cd , @xmath2cd(p , n)@xmath2 in and @xmath2sn(n ,",
    "p)@xmath2 in @xcite cers were used to evaluate the llsd @xmath7 nmes .",
    "the running sum starts at 0.14 mev@xmath70 at zero excitation energy and reaches a value of 0.31 mev@xmath70 at 3 mev excitation energy .",
    "the value at zero energy can be compared with the value obtained by using the @xmath119-values of the decay in @xmath2 in mentioned above .",
    "the value constructed in this way amounts to nme(ssd)=0.168 mev@xmath70 @xcite . in the case of @xmath3te and @xmath4te",
    "the lack of experimental information in the gt@xmath105 direction prevents us from evaluating the experimental llsd estimates .",
    "however , an estimate of @xmath72(ssd)=0.019 mev@xmath70 in @xmath3te can be obtained from the @xmath14 values of the decay in @xmath3i . finally , in the case of @xmath5nd , although the intermediate nucleus @xmath5pm is not a @xmath78 state , assuming that the excited @xmath78 state at 0.11 mev excitation energy observed in @xmath5nd@xmath12he,@xmath120pm corresponds to all the gt strength measured between 50 kev and 250 kev in the reaction @xmath5sm@xmath121he)@xmath5pm , one obtains an estimate for the ssd @xmath72(ssd)=0.028",
    "mev@xmath70 @xcite . extending the running sum by associating the corresponding gt strengths bins from the reactions in both directions and assuming a coherent addition of all the bins , one gets @xmath72(ssd)=0.13",
    "mev@xmath70 @xcite up to an excitation energy in the intermediate nucleus of 3 mev .",
    "this experimental running sum is included in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in all the cases the experimental running sum is larger than the calculations and tend to be larger than the experimental values extracted from the half - lives .",
    "however , one should always keep in mind that the present experimental llsd estimates are indeed upper limits because the phases of the nmes are considered always positive .",
    "although the present calculations favor coherent phases in the low - energy region , the phases could change depending on the theoretical model .",
    "in particular the sensitivity of these phases to the @xmath36 residual interaction has been studied in ref .",
    "in summary , using a theoretical approach based on a deformed hf+bcs+qrpa calculation with effective skyrme interactions , pairing correlations , and spin - isospin residual separable forces in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 channels , we have studied simultaneously the gt strength distributions of the double-@xmath0-decay partners ( @xmath1ge , @xmath1se ) , ( @xmath2cd , @xmath2sn ) , ( @xmath3te , @xmath3xe ) , ( @xmath4te , @xmath4xe ) , and ( @xmath5nd , @xmath5sm ) reaching the intermediate nuclei @xmath1as , @xmath2 in , @xmath3i , @xmath4i , and @xmath5pm , respectively , as well as their @xmath7 nmes . in this work we use reasonable choices for the two - body effective interaction , residual interactions , deformations , and quenching factors .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the various ingredients in the theoretical model was discussed elsewhere .",
    "our results for the energy distributions of the gt strength have been compared with recent data from cers , whereas the calculated @xmath7 nmes have been compared with the experimental values extracted from the measured half - lives for these processes , as well as with the running sums extracted from cers    the theoretical approach used in this work has demonstrated to be well suited to account for the rich variety of experimental information available on the nuclear gt response .",
    "the global properties of the energy distributions of the gt strength and the @xmath7 nmes are well reproduced , with the exception of a detailed description of the low - lying gt strength distributions that could clearly be improved .",
    "the @xmath7 nmes extracted from the experimental half - lives are also reproduced by the calculations with some overestimation ( underestimation ) in the case of @xmath2cd ( @xmath3te ) .",
    "we have also upgraded the theoretical analysis of ssd and llsd hypotheses and we have compared our calculations with the experimental running sums obtained by considering recent measurements from cers and decays of the intermediate nuclei",
    ".    it will be interesting in the future to extend these calculations by including all the double-@xmath0-decay candidates and to explore systematically the potential of this method",
    ". it will be also interesting to explore the consequences of the isospin symmetry restoration , as it was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in hf+bcs and qrpa neither the ground states nor the excited states are isospin eigenstates , but the expectation values of the @xmath122 operator are conserved .",
    "this implies that in the @xmath56(gt@xmath104 ) the transition operator connects states with a given expectation value of @xmath123 to states with expectation value of @xmath124 .",
