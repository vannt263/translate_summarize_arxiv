    "consider the subset @xmath309 of @xmath7 consisting of functions which are constant between isolated jumps ( i.e. , the jumps do not accumulate anywhere in @xmath136 ) .",

    "our results apply .",
    "we note that these conditions are sufficient for our results .",
    "if these conditions fail to hold then it is possible that the conclusions of our results still hold",
    ". this might be the case for certain non - mixing systems , such as suspended flows considered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we might ask on whether it is possible to by - pass the checking of conditions @xmath126 and @xmath115 to obtain our convergence results . an assumption on the existence of an extreme distribution such as",
    "is still expected to be required .",
    "however , our results would then apply to a broader class of systems where a link between extremes and return time statistics is known , see @xcite .    for hyperbolic systems with attractors ( i.e. those that support sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures )",
    "then we expect similar conclusions to hold on the existence of an extremal process . for related results on extremes for hyperbolic systems ,",
    "see @xcite . to study extremal processes and records for these systems further",
    "work is required .",
    "particular issues include the actual checking of the conditions @xmath126 and @xmath115 , and controlling the regularity of the srb measure @xmath12 ( or regularity of the observable function ) to ensure existence of a non - degenerate limit function @xmath51 .",
    "it is possible to investigate further situations where @xmath115 fails , for example in the case of observable functions maximized at periodic points . for such observables",
    "the limit function @xmath51 in incorporates an extra parameter known as an _",
    "extremal index _ , and for dynamical systems",
    "this has been recently studied , for example in @xcite . to ensure convergence to a corresponding extremal process",
    ", alternative conditions to @xmath115 would need to be formulated .",
    "the results we have stated about extremal processes and records are not exhaustive . combining theorem [ thm.plane ] with the cmt we can obtain results about the distribution of inter - record times ( i.e. @xmath328 ) , the jump sizes ( @xmath329 ) , and the distributions governing the maximum inter - record times / jump sizes , see @xcite . for systems that satisfy conditions",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath115 the joint asymptotic distribution of maxima can also be derived , see ( * ? ? ? * section 5.6 ) . in other directions beyond the scope of this work , we should mention that planar convergence of point processes to a prm ( i.e. conclusions similar to that of theorem [ thm.plane ] ) have been used in the study of convergence to levy processes for certain dynamical systems , see @xcite .",

    "almost sure convergence for records is proved by embedding the maximum process @xmath18 into the extremal process @xmath5 for @xmath334 . however , for dependent processes driven by dynamical systems new ideas are required .",
    "it remains to prove theorem [ thm.plane ] and we do this as follows . in the first instance we show in proposition [ prop.dr_un ] how conditions @xmath126 and @xmath335 can be used to obtain asymptotic independence of blocks of maxima on disjoint intervals . using this result , we then apply the criteria of kallenberg to prove the theorem via a thinning construction as used in @xcite .",
