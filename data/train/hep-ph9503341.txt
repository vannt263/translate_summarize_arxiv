    "in this work we shall look for bound states of mesons containing two @xmath9 quarks and two light @xmath10 or @xmath11 quarks , namely a @xmath12 system .",
    "as mentioned above we shall view such a possible system as a bound state of two @xmath13 mesons , two @xmath14 mesons , or a @xmath15 combination .",
    "it turns out that the bound states are linear combinations of these configurations",
    ". the binding potential will be due to the exchange , in addition to the @xmath8 , of the @xmath16 ,   @xmath17 and @xmath3 mesons .",

    "we shall be interested in obtaining the potential between two heavy mesons . in the heavy quark limit",
    "@xcite the pseudoscalar and vector mesons are degenerate in mass and the bound state problem has to be treated as a multichannel one . as in this limit the masses of the incident and final pairs are equal and the energy of each of these states is just the sum of the two heavy masses , we are also allowed to use non - relativistic methods .",
    "these approximations are adequate for mesons containing @xmath28 quarks but , as we will discuss , are likely to break down for systems with lighter quarks .      as in ref .",

    "@xcite , flatten the potentials at some @xmath80 ; we will choose @xmath81 ; we will discuss how the results depend on @xmath80 for @xmath82 .",
    "in order to obtain a bound state we require that the long range part of the potential ( @xmath8 exchange ) be attractive . from eqs .",
    "( [ pot1],[pot2 ] ) we see that the light quark configurations must be either @xmath83 , @xmath84 or @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; as expected the greatest attraction is in an orbital @xmath87-wave state . as the space - spin - isospin of the light quarks is antisymmetric they must be in a symmetric color state , the * 6 * ; this implies that the two @xmath88 quarks are in the * 6*@xmath89 , forcing them to be in a spin singlet state .",
    "thus the possible bound states are either a @xmath90 state or a @xmath91 state .",
    "these are linear combinations of @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s : @xmath92 with similar expressions for the other two @xmath19 states .",

    "to order @xmath94 the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath95 a basis for the system is provided by the states @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the bound system .",
    "note that @xmath97 includes the orbital angular momentum of the heavy quarks as well .",
    "since the potential is rotationally invariant , the total angular momentum @xmath98 is a good quantum number and can be used to label the eigenstates . the @xmath21 ( singlet ) state is written as @xmath99 and @xmath100 and",
    "can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a generalized spherical harmonic obtained by combining spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "both the singlet and triplet states must further be supplemented by an isospin label , with @xmath18 or 1 .    with @xmath103 ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the singlet case is @xmath104 prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath105 . for the spin triplet case the tensor force couples @xmath106 to @xmath107 and we get two coupled differential equations , @xmath108 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ w '' & = & m_{\\mbox{\\rm eff}}\\left [ \\left ( v_0 + { 1\\over 4}\\,v_s + { 6\\over { m_{\\mbox{\\rm eff}}\\,r^2 } } -{1\\over 6}\\,v_t -\\epsilon\\right)\\,w+ { 1\\over { 3{\\sqrt 2}}}\\,v_t\\,u \\right ] \\ , .",

    "( [ singlet ] ) and ( [ triplet ] ) for the energy eigenvalue @xmath109 ; @xmath11 is fixed at 0.53 and the @xmath110 masses are taken to be 5.279 gev and 5.325 gev respectively .",
    "@xmath111 is varied between 2.27 and 3.7 .    for the singlet case",
    ", we find that there are bound states only in the @xmath20 channel , forcing the color wavefunction to be in the symmetric * 6 * representation , as mentioned earlier .",
    "we observe from the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) of the singlet wavefunction that the lightest constituents the state can decay into is two @xmath13 mesons .",
    "hence the true binding energy is @xmath112 the state is bound if @xmath113 is negative .",
    "binding occurs only for @xmath114 and @xmath115 gev at the extreme of the allowed range , @xmath116 .",
    "hence we conclude that the singlet configuration is unlikely to be bound .",
    "we now move to the triplet configuration . here , the lightest constituents the state can decay into is a @xmath13 and a @xmath14 meson .",
    "hence the true binding energy is given by @xmath117 fig .",
    "1 summarizes the numerical results for the allowed range of @xmath111 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is a stable bound state over the entire allowed range of the coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "one interesting issue to explore is the sensitivity of the binding energy to the cutoff @xmath80 , below which the potential is flattened .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath113 on @xmath80 , for a central value of the ratio @xmath118 .",
    "the lightest particle above the vector mesons which can contribute to the potential is the @xmath72 , or the @xmath119 .",
    "these correspond to a value of @xmath80 in the neighborhood of about 1 gev@xmath120 .",
    "we see from fig .  2 that a cutoff less than about 1 gev@xmath120 leads to a very high binding energy ; indeed , the non - relativistic formulation of the system breaks down .",
    "hence the potential derived here can not be trusted for values of the cutoff much less than 1 gev@xmath120 .",
    "we note that @xmath121 is a conservative estimate for determining whether binding does or does not occur .",
    "we repeated the calculations for smaller reduced masses to see what happens for the @xmath122 and @xmath123 systems . from fig .",
    "3 we could claim that both of these will be bound for a triplet light quark spin configuration .",
    "this interpretation is too naive . as has been emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite the heavy quark limit can not be use for the study of binding of charmed mesons . for @xmath8 exchange the range of the potential is nor @xmath124 , but @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "this value is close to zero , and for several charge combinations negative .",
    "( for the @xmath127 system this gives a 6% correction to the range of the @xmath8 exchange potential . )",
    "thus the breaking of heavy quark symmetry and even the breaking of isospin invariance will be crucial to the study of this system .",
    "as in the nucleon - nucleon case we could look at the single channel @xmath122 problem . as there is no one-@xmath8 exchange potential for this configuration , this system is unlikely to be bound .",
    "the @xmath128 mass difference would force us to treat this as a three body @xmath129 system .",
