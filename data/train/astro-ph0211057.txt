    "neutron stars may suffer a number of instabilities .",
    "these instabilities come in different flavours , but they have one general feature in common : they can be directly associated with unstable modes of oscillation .",
    "a study of the stability properties of a relativistic star is closely related to an investigation of the star s various pulsation modes .",
    "furthermore , non - axisymmetric stellar oscillations will inevitably lead to the production of gravitational radiation .",
    "should these waves turn out to be detectable , they would provide a fingerprint that could be used to put constraints on the interior structure of the star @xcite .",
    "this would be analogous to the recent success story of helioseismology , where the detailed spectrum of solar oscillation modes has been matched to theoretical models of the interior to provide insights into , for example , the sound speed at different depths in the sun . in order for `` gravitational - wave asteroseismology '' to be a realistic proposition",
    ", one must find scenarios which lead to a star pulsating wildly .",
    "the most obvious situation where this may be the case is when a newly born neutron star settles down after the supernova collapse .",
    "other promising possibilities are associated with instabilities .",
    "as an unstable pulsation mode grows it may reach a sufficiently large amplitude that the emerging gravitational waves can be detected .",
    "the aim of this article is to provide an overview of instabilities that may lead to detectable gravitational waves .",
    "this is a topical theme given that several large - scale interferometers ( ligo , geo600 , virgo and tama300 ) will be up and running in the near future .",
    "my intention is to put the current thinking about various stellar instabilities in context , and provide a foundation for future research in this area by summarizing what we currently know and , perhaps more importantly , what the key issues that need further attention are .",
    "this review is , however , by no means exhaustive .",
    "it does not provide a `` complete '' set of references to the literature or a detailed discussion of every possible instability that may occur in a relativistic star .",
    "i have simply focussed on the issues that seem ( to me ) to be the most interesting / important .",
    "the reader is encouraged to use the provided bibliography as an entry point to the vast literature on instabilities and other gravitational - wave sources @xcite , explore it for him / herself , and perhaps even draw conclusions that differ from mine .",
    "neutron stars are tremendously complicated objects . in essence",
    ", their modelling requires a detailed understanding of the very extremes of physics , including supranuclear physics , general relativity , superfluidity / superconductivity , strong magnetic fields , exotic particle physics etcetera @xcite .",
    "to investigate the pulsation properties of any `` realistic '' neutron star model is therefore a serious challenge .",
    "while our understanding of the modes of a simple self - gravitating `` ball of fluid '' may be good , a significant effort is still required if we want to model the dynamics of astrophysical compact stars .",
    "the instabilities that i will discuss fall into two main categories : they are either dynamical or secular . in the first case",
    "the unstable modes grow on a timescale similar to that of the oscillations , while in the second the growth takes place on a much longer timescale ( eg . that associated with viscosity ) .",
    "a dynamical instability is likely to have dramatic effects on an equilibrium configuration , while a secular instability acts in a more subtle way .",
    "as we will see , this means that dynamical instabilites can be studied directly using fully nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the effects of a secular instability are difficult to explore in this way since the evolutionary timescale tends to be much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "hence , secular instability evolutions have so far mainly been discussed at a phenomenological level .",
    "most of the discussion in this article concerns rotating stars .",
    "this is natural since instabilities in spinning stars are thought to be particularly promising gravitational - wave sources .",
    "a question of key astrophysical importance concerns whether instabilities may limit the spin of a compact star to a rate significantly lower than the mass - shedding limit .",
    "this limit is reached when the equator rotates at the kepler frequency of a particle in circular orbit around the star .",
    "it is well approximated by a rotation frequency @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the average density of the corresponding non - rotating star .",
    "this is known to be a good approximation for rigidly rotating newtonian polytropes @xcite , and it remains reasonably accurate also for relativistic models @xcite .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the mass - shedding limit may be significantly different in the case of differentially rotating stars .",
    "in fact , the rotation frequency @xmath2 is not a particularly useful parameter for differentially rotating configurations ( see @xcite ) . instead",
    ", the ratio @xmath3 between the kinetic energy @xmath4 and the gravitational potential energy @xmath5 is often used in discussions of rotational instabilities .",
    "the values of @xmath3 are restricted ( by the virial theorem ) to the range @xmath6 . for",
    "a uniformly rotating constant density star one can estimate that @xmath7 in other words , the mass shedding limit would correspond to @xmath8 .",
    "this simple approximation agrees quite well with detailed calculations for realistic supranuclear equations of state , which typically indicate a maximum value of @xmath3 in the range 0.09 - 0.13 .",
    "depending on the rotation law , differentially rotating models may allow considerably larger values of @xmath3 ( maybe as large as @xmath9 ) .",
    "large maximum values of @xmath3 can also be reached for strange stars .",
    "such self - bound objects may have @xmath3 significantly larger than 0.2 @xcite .",
    "among astrophysicists general relativity is sometimes viewed as a `` correction '' ( expected to alter results quantitatively at the 15 - 20% level ) .",
    "this attitude makes some sense since many astrophysical results remain essentially unaltered by a fully relativistic description . on the other hand ,",
    "there are situations where general relativity is a `` leading order effect '' which must be incorporated .",
    "the dynamics of compact stars provides an excellent example of this .",
    "it is well known that it is meaningless ( or at least highly dubious ) to use a realistic supranuclear equation of state in a newtonian calculation of neutron star structure .",
    "the mass and radius of the resultant star may differ greatly from the results obtained from the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations ( for a given central density ) , and in order to avoid confusion one should always use relativistic models for `` realistic '' neutron stars .",
    "in addition , gravitational waves are a purely relativistic phenomenon .",
    "so if we are interested in neutron stars as gravitational - wave sources it stands to reason that we should aim to build fully relativistic models .",
    "however , this is a far from simple task .",
    "since much of the physics required for a realistic model of neutron star dynamics is poorly understood we are in practice often forced to work with newtonian models , estimating gravitational waves via post - newtonian formulas .",
    "if we focus our attention on a single pulsation mode of a rotating newtonian star then , assuming that the density and velocity perturbations , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , depend on time as @xmath12 , the associated gravitational - wave luminosity ( measured in the rotating frame ) can be estimated using @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the mode - frequency in the inertial ( rotating ) frame , and @xmath16 ^ 2 } \\ .\\ ] ] the first term in the bracket of ( [ gwlum ] ) represents radiation due to the mass multipoles .",
    "these are determined by @xmath17 ( where the asterisk represents complex conjugation ) .",
    "the second term in the bracket of ( [ gwlum ] ) corresponds to the current multipoles , which follow from @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the magnetic multipoles @xcite .    from the above formulas we can draw some general conclusions .",
    "first of all it is clear that any fluid motion that leads to significant density variations will radiate gravitationally predominantly through the mass multipoles .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath20 which means that the current multipole radiation is generally `` one order higher '' in the post - newtonian approximation in each of the terms in ( [ gwlum ] ) we see that quadrupole perturbations ( @xmath21 ) will lead to @xmath22 for the mass multipoles , while @xmath23 for the current multipole radiation . using the standard way of counting orders",
    ", this means that the mass multipole radiation arises at 2.5 post - newtonian order while the current multipole radiation is a 3.5 post - newtonian effect . ] . however , there are situations where this standard consensus no longer holds and the current multipoles provide the main radiation mechanism .",
    "most notably , this is the case for the unstable r - modes which are characterized by a large @xmath24 and a small @xmath10 .    in the relativistic case ,",
    "the calculation of gravitational - wave emission from stellar pulsation is conceptually more straightforward .",
    "because any non - axisymmetric fluid motion will lead to radiation , the various modes are distinguished by imposing outgoing - wave boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this means that they are no longer normal modes of the system .",
    "gravitational - wave dissipation leads to the mode - frequencies becoming complex ( with the imaginary part representing the damping / growth due to the emitted radiation ) . as is well - known from studies of perturbed black holes the numerical determination of such `` quasinormal modes '' is not trivial .",
    "several reliable methods for handling this difficulty for spherical stars have been developed @xcite , but a solution to the problem for rapidly rotating stars is still outstanding .",
    "once we have some idea of the character of a given gravitational - wave source it is relevant to try to estimate the detectability of the signal .",
    "the obtained estimates are often rough , but they provide useful guidelines for further work , both on the theoretical modelling side and the experimental side . if initial estimates make it seem plausible that the source can be detected then a detailed data analysis strategy needs to be developed . in the ideal case",
    "this strategy would be based on matched filtering , where an accurate theoretical template is used to search for a real signal in the noisy data stream",
    ". however , in many cases our understanding of the relevant physics is not at the level where we can expect to provide reliable theoretical models .",
    "this is certainly the case for neutron stars , where crucial pieces of physics like the equation of state are only known to within a factor of two or so .",
    "the detectability of a signal can nevertheless be improved considerably given only overall characteristics , like the duration and the frequency range .",
    "any information we can extract from the theoretical models , even if they are rudimentary , could be valuable !    in order to estimate the strength of a signal , we can use the well - known flux formula which relates the luminosity to the gravitational - wave strain @xmath25 ; @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance to the source .",
    "this relation is exact for the weak waves that bathe the earth . to proceed we characterize the event by a timescale @xmath28 and",
    "assume that the signal is essentially monochromatic .",
    "then we can use @xmath29 , and readily deduce that @xmath30 here we have taken the distance to be that of a source in the virgo cluster .",
    "this is necessary to ensure a reasonable event rate for most astrophysical scenarios . at that distance",
    "one would expect to see many supernovae per year , which means that one can hope to see a few neutron stars being born during one year of observation .",
    ".canonical parameter values used in various formulas in the article .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ param ]    we can proceed further and estimate an `` effective amplitude '' that reflects the fact that detailed knowledge of the signal can be used to dig deeper into the noise .",
    "a typical example is based on the use of matched filtering , for which the effective amplitude improves as the square root of the number of observed cycles @xmath31 .",
    "using @xmath32 we arrive at @xmath33 from this relation we see that the `` detector sensitivity '' essentially depends only on the radiated energy and the characteristic frequency . hence , an estimate of the total energy radiated and the frequency of the signal may be sufficient to assess the relevance of the event as a gravitational - wave source .",
    "the above formulas can be applied to many interesting astrophysical scenarios , but there are obvious situations where they fail .",
    "one case , that will be discussed later , is when gravitational radiation reaction leads to a change in the character of the signal during the observation .",
    "this typically leads to a signal whose frequency varies with time .",
    "provided that this variation is sufficiently slow one can use the method of stationary phase to show that @xmath34 for example , owen et al @xcite used this relation to assess the detectability of gravitational waves from unstable r - modes .",
    "in this section i will describe the nature of those pulsation modes that are currently thought to be the most relevant from the gravitational - wave point of view",
    ". the main focus will be on the acoustic f - modes and the inertial r - modes , but i will also briefly mention the gravitational - wave w - modes . for more details ,",
    "the reader is refered to standard textbooks @xcite and various review articles @xcite .      in order to close the system of equations that describe linear oscillations of a star it is necessary to provide an equation of state for matter .",
    "this problem is extremely difficult  at least if we expect to find the `` correct '' answer .",
    "the proposed equations of state for supranuclear matter come in many varieties and lead to equilibrium neutron stars whose bulk properties vary by up to factors of two .",
    "the available predictions also differ considerably on issues concerning the nature of matter at extreme densities .",
    "many important questions remain to be resolved .",
    "will a neutron star have an exotic core containing deconfined quarks and/or hyperons ?",
    "are there strange matter stars ? at what density and temperature",
    "do various constituents become superfluid / superconducting ? as we will discuss later , the answers to these questions are crucial for an understanding of the stability properties of relativistic stars . at the time of writing",
    ", the permissible parameter space is enormous .",
    "detailed nuclear physics calculations typically provide a tabulated equation of state relating the pressure to the density for matter in beta equilibrium .",
    "this provides sufficient information for us to construct eg . rotating equilibria , and thus model unperturbed neutron stars . in these models matter",
    "is usually modelled as a perfect fluid .",
    "the temperature is typically ( unless one considers newly born neutron stars ) taken to be zero , because even though neutron stars may seem hot on a `` normal physics scale '' , with interior temperatures in the range @xmath35  k , the thermal energy is considerably smaller than the fermi energy of the fluid ,",
    "@xmath36  k. as a consequence a one - parameter equation of state @xmath37 is often sufficient to describe the matter . in this",
    "article stars constructed from such equations of state are refered to as `` barotropic '' .",
    "a simple yet reasonable class of equations of state are the polytropes @xmath38 where @xmath31 is the polytropic index .",
    "a comparison with proposed realistic equations of state suggests that @xmath39 , and hence model calculations are often carried out for @xmath40 polytropes .",
    "more detailed models account for the dependence on additional parameters , the most important of which may be the relative number density of protons ( @xmath41 ) and exotic particles like hyperons and/or deconfined quarks @xcite .",
    "stars described by such multi - parameter equations of state , @xmath42 , are `` non - barotropic '' and have internal stratification",
    ". this stratification may affect the pulsation properties of the star significantly .",
    "for example , internal stratification associated with chemical composition gradients leads to the presence of distinct gravity g - modes @xcite .    since we want to study oscillating stars we face a further challenge .",
    "the mode motion will inevitably force the fluid out of equilibrium , which means that the available tabulated equations of state only provide partial information . to address the pulsation problem we need to know the `` exact '' equation of state in order to relate the various ( eulerian ) perturbations , eg .",
    "@xmath43 this requires the knowledge of physics that is poorly understood .",
    "hence it is customary to approach the problem in the following way : we simply allow the perturbations to be governed by an equation of state that differs from that which describes the background configuration . to do this",
    "we relate the lagrangian pressure and density variations by @xmath44 where @xmath45 need not be equal to @xmath46 . from this definition",
    "it immediately follows that the eulerian variations are related by @xmath47 =   \\gamma_1 { \\delta \\rho \\over \\rho } +   { \\vec{\\xi } \\cdot   \\nabla\\rho \\over \\rho } ( \\gamma_1 -\\gamma )   \\label{eospert}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the lagrangian displacement vector , i.e. @xmath49 , and the last equality only holds for polytropes .",
    "here it is customary to introduce the so - called schwarzschild discriminant @xmath50 . for a spherical stellar model where @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath53 we have @xmath54 the key point of this approach",
    "is that one can easily account for the buoyancy due to internal stratification ( whatever the physical reasons for its presence may be ) by considering models with a non - zero schwarzschild discriminant .",
    "this way we can parameterize our ignorance concerning the detailed physics involved in real stellar pulsations .",
    "a realistic neutron star model has a large number of families of pulsation modes with more or less distinct character . in principle",
    ", one expects each physical `` restoring force '' that acts on a fluid element to lead to the presence of a new family of pulsation modes .",
    "an exhaustive description of the all these various modes goes far beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "here we are mainly interested in modes that may become unstable and lead to a significant gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the modes that are currently thought to be the most important in this respect are the acoustic f - modes and the coriolis restored r - modes .",
    "in addition to being associated with different restoring forces , stellar pulsation modes can be classified by the way that the perturbations transform under parity .",
    "this is a useful classification since the overall parity of a perturbation is preserved when rotation is present .",
    "this means that one can follow the changes in a particular parity mode as @xmath2 is varied , and meaningfully label the mode by its nature in the non - rotating limit ( eg . the spherical harmonic indices @xmath55 and @xmath56 used to describe the angular dependence and the number of radial nodes of the mode - eigenfunction ) .    a general velocity field can be represented by @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the standard spherical harmonics .",
    "the first two terms in the sum transform as @xmath59 under parity , while the last term changes as @xmath60 .",
    "these two classes of perturbations are often ( in relativity ) referred to as polar and axial , respectively .",
    "this nomenclature was introduced by chandrasekhar for perturbed black holes @xcite . in a non - rotating star",
    "the various multipoles decouple , but in the rotating case they are coupled in such a way that the overall parity of the mode is preserved .",
    "that is , polar terms corresponding to even values of @xmath55 are coupled to axial terms for odd @xmath55 , and vice versa .",
    "the f - mode , which can be viewed as the fundamental pressure mode of the star , is present already in a non - rotating star .",
    "it corresponds to polar perturbations and , as was first shown by kelvin , for a non - rotating uniform density star its frequency is given by @xmath61 this is a reasonable approximation also for more realistic equations of state , and we can readily deduce that a typical neutron star has f - mode frequency ( @xmath62 ) in the range 24  khz ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "mode frequencies and gravitational - wave damping rates for non - rotating stars constructed for many realistic equations of state are illustrated in figure  [ moderes ] , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because of the symmetry of the non - rotating problem , modes corresponding to different @xmath55 and @xmath56 decouple .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to consider the @xmath63 case .",
    "rotation complicates the problem considerably .",
    "first of all , it breaks the symmetry in such a way that the various @xmath64 modes become distinct . as a first approximation one finds that the f - mode frequencies change as @xmath65 according to an inertial observer .",
    "here , @xmath66 is the frequency of the mode in the non - rotating case , cf .",
    "( [ fmode ] ) , and @xmath67 is a function that depends on the mode - eigenfunction in a non - rotating star .",
    "rotation also couples the various multipoles , which means that an increasing number of @xmath68 s are needed to describe a mode as the rotation rate is increased .",
    "one must also account for coupling between the polar and axial vectors .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the rotationally induced change in shape of the star , which first contributes at @xmath69 in the slow - rotation expansion .    as we will see later",
    ", it is often useful to consider the `` pattern speed '' of the mode .",
    "every mode of an axially symmetric system can be assumed to be proportional to @xmath70 , and surfaces of constant phase are therefore given by @xmath71 after differentiation this leads to @xmath72 which defines the pattern speed @xmath73 of the mode .",
    "having defined this quantity it is worth making two observations concerning the ( @xmath74 ) f - modes .",
    "1 ) from ( [ fmode ] ) we see that the frequency of these modes increases with @xmath56 roughly as @xmath75 . according to ( [ pattern ] ) this means that the pattern speed of the f - modes decreases as we increase @xmath56 . as a consequence one can always find an f - mode with arbitrarily small pattern speed ( corresponding to a suitably large value of @xmath56 ) even though the high order f - modes have increasingly large frequencies .",
    "2 ) we can also see that mode patterns corresponding to opposite signs of @xmath56 tend to rotate around the star in different directions .",
    "taking the positive direction to be that associated with @xmath2 we find that the @xmath76 modes are backwards and forwards moving ( retro / prograde ) , respectively , in the limit of vanishing rotation .",
    "however , rotation may change the situation for the @xmath74 f - modes .",
    "( the particular case of the @xmath77 modes of a maclaurin spheroid is illustrated in figure  [ macmodes ] . ) combining ( [ fmode ] ) with ( [ rotfreq ] )  where we neglect @xmath67 for simplicity  we can estimate that these modes becomes prograde for rotation rates above @xmath78 in other words , all but the @xmath79 f - modes are likely to change from backwards to forwards moving ( according to an inertial observer ) at realistic rates of rotation ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this result is brought out clearly by more accurate calculations .",
    "using their two - potential formalism , ipser and lindblom @xcite have calculated the @xmath74 f - modes for rapidly rotating newtonian polytropes .",
    "their results are reproduced in figure  [ ilfig ] .",
    "similar results have been obtained by yoshida and eriguchi @xcite .",

    "we graph @xmath85 as a function of the rotation rate .",

    "[ data provided by lee lindblom .",
    "] , height=226 ]    a non - rotating fluid star has no non - trivial axial modes ( in newtonian theory ) .",
    "this situation is altered by rotation , which leads to the presence of inertial modes whose dynamics is governed by the coriolis force ( see for example @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a general inertial mode is such that @xmath24 is composed of a mixture of polar and axial components to leading order , i.e. one can take @xmath87 \\sim \\omega$ ] . with this ordering ,",

    "the r - mode frequencies are easy to determine from the fact that the radial component of the vorticity is conserved by their fluid motion , and one finds that @xcite @xmath91    a non - barotropic star has an infinite number of r - modes for each @xmath55 and @xmath92 @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "only a single r - mode ( for each @xmath74 ) exists in a barotropic star .",
    "this mode is associated with the simple fact that the star is a sphere and not a cylinder ( which is relevant since the coriolis operator has cylindrical symmetry ) . as a result ,",
    "this mode is only weakly dependent on internal stratification . in the general case",
    "the radial dependency of the r - mode eigenfunctions remains undetermined at order @xmath2 , and the calculation must be taken to order @xmath93 .",
    "the barotropic case is , again , different in that one can determine that @xmath94 already at leading order @xcite .",
    "the pattern speed for a typical @xmath74 r - mode is @xmath95 according to an observer rotating with the star .",
    "meanwhile , an inertial observer would find @xmath96 that is , although the modes appear retrograde in the rotating system an inertial observer would view them as prograde at all rotation rates .",
    "given the eigenfunctions for a pulsation mode of a newtonian star , we can use the multipole formulas in section  [ sec : gw ] to estimate the rate at which the oscillation is damped by gravitational radiation emission .",
    "as far as the f - modes are concerned , they are associated with significant density variations and one can easily show that the main contribution to the gravitational - wave damping comes from the mass multipoles .",
    "detweiler @xcite has shown that , for uniform density stars , the gravitational - wave damping timescale can be estimated as @xmath97 ^ 2 \\over ( l+1)(l+2 ) } \\left [ { 2l+1 \\over 2l(l-1)}\\right]^l \\left ( { c^2 r \\over gm }   \\right)^{l+1 } { r \\over c } \\label{tgwnon}\\ ] ] or @xmath98  s for the quadrupole modes . from this",
    "we see that the typical damping rate for the quadrupole f - mode will be of the order of a tenth of a second .",
    "detailed results for a collection of realistic equations of state are given in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "an order count based on the multipole formulas suggests that the r - modes are different . for @xmath74 r - modes the dominant contribution to the gravitational radiation comes from the first term in the current multipole formula ( [ curr ] ) .",
    "that this is the case can be seen as follows .",
    "the @xmath74 modes have axial displacement to leading order @xmath99 , while the density variation @xmath10 enters at order @xmath93 . furthermore , we know that if the axial component corresponds to the @xmath55th multipole , then the polar components that arise from rotational coupling will correspond to @xmath100 .",
    "this means that we have @xmath101 so @xmath102 , while @xmath103 leads to @xmath104 . as a gravitational - wave source the r - modes are therefore quite unusual .",
    "the gravitational radiation that they emit comes primarily from the time - dependent mass currents , and is the gravitational analogue of magnetic multipole radiation .",
    "schematically , the relativistic problem consists of the perturbed einstein equations @xmath105 and the equations of motion @xmath106 we need to solve ( a subset of ) these equations for the four - velocity associated with the mode and the perturbed spacetime metric @xmath107 . in this calculation ,",
    "the fluid four velocity is decomposed in a way that is completely analogous to the newtonian description , cf .",
    "( [ vdec ] ) , while the metric perturbations are represented by the corresponding tensor decomposition ( see @xcite ) . just like in the newtonian case",
    ", we can study axial and polar perturbations separately .",
    "the relativistic perturbation equations have been derived many times over , and explicit formulas are given in ( for example ) @xcite .",
    "a nice gauge - invariant description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the solutions that represent a pulsation mode satisfy the appropriate regularity conditions at the centre of the star and correspond to purely outgoing waves at infinity .",
    "as already mentioned , the imposition of this boundary condition presents a technical challenge @xcite .",
    "several reliable techniques have been developed to handle this difficulty , and the pulsations of non - rotating relativistic stars are by now well understood @xcite .",
    "the spinning star problem still presents a challenge , however , and the problem of calculating oscillation modes of rapidly rotating neutron stars in general relativity ( including the imaginary parts of @xmath108 associated with gravitational - wave damping ) remains unsolved .    as we will see later , the neutral modes ( representing the point where an originally retrograde mode becomes prograde ) of a rotating star determine the onset of gravitational - wave driven instability .",
    "consequently , one can focus attention on the simplified problem of finding time - independent solutions to the perturbation equations",
    ". such solutions would be marginally unstable .",
    "a numerical solution to this problem was obtained by stergioulas and friedman @xcite for polytropic stars .",
    "their results show that relativistic effects tend to destabilize a rotating star considerably .",
    "interestingly , one finds that in general relativity the @xmath109 f - mode may have a neutral point for attainable rates of rotation .",
    "this result , which constrasts with the newtonian case shown in figure  [ ilfig ] , has been shown to hold also for realistic equations of state @xcite .",
    "an empirical fit to results for several realistic equations of state suggests that the @xmath109 f - mode becomes secularly unstable at @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the maximum allowed mass of a nonrotating star for the given equation of state . for a typical @xmath112 star",
    "the @xmath109 f - mode has a neutral point near @xmath82 or @xmath113 .",
    "this result could be of considerable importance since mass quadrupole radiation is likely to lead to the fastest instability growth .",

    "the obtained results show that the cowling approximation tends to overestimate the stability of the star , and therefore emphasize the conclusion that relativity has a destabilizing effect .",
    "general relativity also affects the r - modes in a significant way .",

    "even though such extremely compact stars may not exist in the universe ( no proposed realistic equations of state permit stars more compact than @xmath141 ) , they are still intriguing .",
    "in particular since , when rotating , they may admit the presence of an ergosphere , i.e. a region ( located inside the star ) in which all observers must be dragged along with the stars rotation .",
    "this could lead to @xcite the w - modes becoming unstable due to the same mechanism that drives the cfs unstable fluid modes ( see section  [ sec : sec ] ) .",

    "it would be favourable for a perturbed maclaurin spheroid to move towards either the jacobi or the dedekind sequence",

    "the mode becomes unstable to the viscosity driven instability . that the instability should set in at this point",

    "@xmath151 the two modes have identical oscillation frequencies and their angular momenta will vanish . given this ,",
    "one of the degenerate modes can grow without violating the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the physical conditions required for the dynamical instability are easily understood .",

    "each strategy has its merits and drawbacks .",
    "the variational - principle approach is appealing from a formal point of view , and it is well known from many branches of physics that variational principles are closely connected to stability criteria .",
    "once one has defined a suitable `` energy '' for the perturbations , stability simply follows from its sign for any given perturbation .",
    "however , the obtained relations can be difficult to use in practice .",
    "it may also be difficult to conclusively rule out instabilities .",
    "the mode - calculation approach is less elegant , but has the advantage that one can test each individual mode for stability . on the other hand , a failure to find an unstable mode",
    "does not necessarily mean that one does not exist .",
    "the main development of the theoretical framework for studying stellar stability in general relativity took place in the 1970s .",
    "key early contributions were made by chandrasekhar and friedman @xcite and schutz @xcite .",
    "their work attempted to extend the conclusions from newtonian studies  that the onset of non - axisymmetric instability is signalled by the appearance of a neutral ( zero - frequency ) mode .",
    "there are two main reasons why a relativistic analysis is significantly more complicated than the newtonian one .",
    "first of all the problem is algebraically more complex because one must solve the einstein field equations in addition to the fluid equations of motion .",
    "secondly , one must account for the fact that a general perturbation will generate gravitational waves .",
    "this is a fundamental complication since a mode - based proof of stability would require some kind of completeness of the modes of the star . since the relativistic modes are `` quasinormal '' ( they have complex frequencies , with the imaginary part corresponding to the gravitational - wave damping ) they are unlikely to be complete in any meaningful sense @xcite",
    ".    the work of friedman and schutz culminated in a series of impressive papers @xcite in which the role that gravitational radiation plays in these problems was explained , and a foundation for subsequent research in this area was established .",
    "the main result was that gravitational radiation acts in the same way in the full theory as in chandrasekhar s post - newtonian analysis of the maclaurin spheroids @xcite .",
    "if we consider a sequence of equilibrium models , then a mode becomes secularly unstable at the point where its frequency vanishes ( in the inertial frame ) .",
    "most importantly , the proof does not require the completeness of the modes of the system .",
    "the friedman - schutz criterion for instability relies on the so - called canonical energy @xmath166 being negative .",
    "the canonical energy is defined as @xmath167   dv\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 represents the background flow .",
    "one can also define a ( conserved ) canonical angular momentum @xmath169    the canonical energy and angular momentum are conserved in absence of radiation and viscosity .",
    "this means that , in order to have a dynamical instability ( unbounded growth of a linear mode of the inviscid problem ) we must have @xmath170 .",
    "if @xmath166 is negative at the outset and the star is coupled to radiation in such a way that @xmath166 must decrease with time , then the absolute value of @xmath166 will increase and the associated mode will be unstable . generally , an instability can be established in a mode - independent way by constructing ( canonical ) initial data @xmath171 $ ] such that @xmath166 is negative . to do",
    "this is , however , not a simple task . from the computational point of view",
    "it is easier to calculate a mode of a rotating star and then evaluate @xmath166 to assess stability .",
    "it is sufficient to show that the displacement vector associated with the mode leads to @xmath172 to demonstrate the presence of an instability .",
    "the simple intuitive instability criterion can be deduced from the relation @xmath173 which is a general property of linear waves .",
    "we see that @xmath166 changes sign when the inertial frame pattern speed @xmath149 passes through zero . beyond this point",
    "the mode moves forwards with respect to the inertial frame while it is still moving backwards in the rotating frame .",
    "gravitational waves from such a mode carry positive angular momentum away from the star , but since the perturbed fluid actually rotates slower than it would in absence of the perturbation the angular momentum of the mode is negative .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves consequently makes the angular momentum of the mode increasingly negative and leads to the instability .",
    "this instability is often refered to as the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the secular radiation driven instability to that associated with viscosity . for uniformly rotating stars",
    "one can show that the combination @xmath174 relating the first order changes in the kinetic energy and angular momentum to a mode - solution , is gauge - invariant .",
    "@xmath175 can be viewed as the canonical energy in the rotating reference frame .",
    "viscosity leads to @xmath175 being a decreasing function of time . from ( [ ecrot ] )",
    "we can deduce that the onset of the viscosity driven instability is signalled by the vanishing of the mode pattern speed in the rotating frame ( @xmath176 ) .    in order to investigate whether an instability is of astrophysical relevance ,",
    "whether it leads to a detectable gravitational - wave signal , one must address two main questions .",
    "first of all , one must understand under what circumstances the instability will be present and how likely it is that a star will evolve through the relevant part of parameter space .",
    "secondly , one must establish that the unstable mode grows on a sufficiently short timescale .",
    "this is always the case for dynamical instabilities , but as we will see in the following sections the issues that decide whether a secular instability is relevant or not are much more delicate .",
    "the most familiar stellar instability is probably that associated with the existence of a maximum mass configuration for any given equation of state .",
    "a spherical relativistic star will suffer a dynamical instability before the compactness reaches the schwarzschild limit @xcite .",
    "in general relativity you can never have stable stars with @xmath177 and no realistic equations of state permit stars more compact than @xmath141 .",
    "once an accreting neutron star reaches the maximum mass limit it will become unstable and undergo gravitational collapse , most likely leading to the formation of a black hole .",
    "the maximum mass limit provides one of very few handles that we currently have on the supranuclear equation of state .",
    "several neutron star masses have been deduced from pulsar observations and , in order to be acceptable , a proposed equation of state must allow for masses at least as large those observed . the data for the binary pulsar psr1913 + 16 provides the constraint @xmath178 , which allows us to rule out extremely soft equations of state .",
    "a much more severe constraint on the theoretical models may be provided by the data for the vela pulsar .",
    "several studies have estimated the mass of vela to be about @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "many proposed equations of state would be in trouble if this result were to be confirmed .",
    "in particular , neutron star models with sizeable exotic cores composed of hyperons and/or deconfined quarks which tend to soften the equation of state @xcite might then be ruled out .",
    "the maximum mass instability is relatively easy to analyse in the case of non - rotating stars .",
    "it sets in through the radial ( @xmath180 ) f - modes . since the equations that describe radial oscillations depend only on @xmath181 the mode frequencies come in pairs ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "calculations show that , as one increases the central density of the star ( for a given equation of state ) the absolute value of the stable ( real valued ) f - mode frequencies decreases .",
    "it passes through zero at the point at which the mass reaches an extremum . beyond that `` turning point '' ,",
    "the mode frequencies become a complex conjugate pair , and thus one of the modes is unstable .",
    "the simplicity of the `` turning point method '' for locating the onset of instability along a sequence of equilibrium models is extremely appealing .",
    "it is , however , not immediately obvious that it will generalize to a more complicated setting  like rotating stars .",
    "the problem is , in fact , quite subtle .",
    "a dynamical stability analysis requires evaluation of a complicated energy functional , and then relies on non - degenerate perturbation theory to deduce stability .",
    "however , instabilities set in through zero - frequency modes , and the simple non - rotating barotropic models that one would typically consider in this context have a degenerate set of such neutral modes  the inertial modes .",
    "these would be distinct in a non - barotropic model ( in which they become the g - modes ) , but in the barotropic case they all have zero frequency .",
    "a proper stability analysis must take the presence of these modes into account . in order to single out a `` marginally unstable '' mode from the sea of inertial modes one must use degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "this is not a simple task .",
    "fortunately , sorkin @xcite has provided a detailed proof that the turning point method can be used to locate the onset of instability .",
    "the proof does not assume mode - completeness and hence neatly circumvents difficulties like that associated with the degenerate inertial modes .",
    "in the case of uniform rotation an extremum of the angular momentum @xmath183 along a sequence with constant baryon number limits the region of stable stars @xcite .",
    "the ( dynamically ) stable region for a typical relativistic star ( represented by the fps equation of state ) is illustrated in figure  [ fps ] . as can be seen in the figure",
    ", rotation generally increases the maximum allowed mass by up to 20% .",
    "it is worth noting that there may exist a class of rotating stars that have no non - rotating counterpart .",
    "these `` supramassive '' stars must eventually collapse if they are spun down , eg . by magnetic dipole radiation @xcite .",
    "has an extremum as a function of the central density .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]   has an extremum as a function of the central density .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    sorkin s theorem states that for barotropic stars a turning point in @xmath183 marks the location of a zero - frequency axisymmetric mode and the onset of dynamical instability . for non - barotropic stars",
    "the situation is a bit more subtle . in that case",
    "the turning point method locates a point where a secular instability sets in .",
    "consequently , a realistic star is likely to undergo a secular instability phase before it reaches the dynamical instability point and collapses .    from an intuitive point of view",
    "one might expect gravitational collapse to lead to a very strong gravitational - wave signal .",
    "however , it is also conceivable that the level of radiation may be low .",
    "the outcome depends entirely on the asymmetry of the collapse process .",
    "a purely spherical collapse will obviously not radiate gravitationally at all , while the collapse of a strongly deformed body could release a copious amount of gravitational waves .",
    "the main reason why it is very difficult to make `` reliable '' estimates for the energy released is that the answer depends entirely on the route that the system follows towards the final configuration .",
    "this is immediately clear from the post - newtonian formulas ( [ gwlum ] ) , which show that the gravitational - wave luminosity depends on high time - derivatives of the various multipoles .    it was originally thought that supernova core - collapse would lead to strong gravitational - wave signals",
    "this expectation has not been confirmed by detailed simulations .",
    "in fact , the available numerical simulations paint a somewhat pessimistic picture .",
    "typical results suggest that an energy equivalent to @xmath184 may be radiated @xcite .",
    "the signal from a collapse that leads to the formation of a black hole is likely to be dominated by the slowest damped quadrupole quasinormal mode of a black hole , i.e. have frequency @xmath185 if we assume that a typical timescale for the event is of the order of a millisecond we find , cf .",
    "( [ heff1 ] ) , that the gravitational - wave amplitude may be of the order of @xmath186 for a source in the virgo cluster .",
    "this estimate ( which accords reasonably well with full numerical simulations ) suggests that such sources are unlikely to be observable beyond the local group of galaxies .    until very recently studies of core collapse focussed mainly on the non - rotating case ( the classic work by stark and piran @xcite being a notable exception ) .",
    "it is perhaps natural to expect that studies of the fully three - dimensional collapse problem may lead to an enhanced radiated energy and maybe even a prediction of clearly detectable waves . to solve this problem is , of course , a far from trivial task",
    "nevertheless , there has been interesting recent progress in this direction @xcite .",
    "numerical relativity is rapidly maturing and it may not be too optimistic to expect that this problem will be manageable in the not too distant future .",
    "having said that , it is clear that there are conceptual issues that may be very hard to resolve , in particular regarding the initial data .",
    "numerical relativists have so far almost exclusively considered initial data obtained using york s conformally flat prescription .",
    "this approach is taken because of its mathematical convenience .",
    "it is reasonable to worry about this since there is absolutely no physical reason why `` realistic '' initial data should be conformally flat .",
    "this is a key issue that needs to be addressed in the future .    in absence of detailed numerical results , it is interesting to speculate about the outcome of the gravitational collapse of a rapidly rotating star .",
    "it stands to reason that this would be a promising source for gravitational radiation , since rotation will couple the various multipoles in such a way that even quasi - radial modes will radiate .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that rapidly rotating stars have a multipolar structure that differs significantly from that of a kerr black hole ( cf .",
    "the results in @xcite ) . in order to form a black hole the collapsing star must in some way",
    "shed the `` difference '' in the various multipole moments .",
    "presumably , this will be done mainly through the emission gravitational waves .",
    "of course , a sceptic would argue that the collapse event may proceed in such a way that the level of radiation is minimal .",
    "future multidimensional simulations will have to provide the real answer .",
    "a collapse related scenario that has been discussed in the literature concerns internal phase - transitions . as a neutron star is spinning down , eg .",
    "due to magnetic dipole radiation , the central density will increase .",
    "various theoretical models suggest that the equation of state may soften significantly once the central density increases beyond a critical value ( several times nuclear density ) .",
    "this could be due to the formation of pion / kaon condensates , the creation of a significant hyperon core or quark deconfinement .",
    "should this happen it is likely to result in a `` mini - collapse '' during which some gravitational potential energy may be released as radiation .",
    "such phase transitions have been suggested as sources for both detectable gravitational waves @xcite and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "however , most of the available estimates seem somewhat optimistic .",
    "the reason for this is very simple .",
    "it is typically assumed that the entire change in potential energy incurred during the contraction is radiated away .",
    "this is at variance with detailed studies which show that the radiated energy is at best only a few percent of this @xcite .",
    "most of the `` lost '' potential energy is transfered into internal energy ( i.e. it heats the star up ) . using results for a uniform density sphere , one can estimate that the change in potential energy @xmath187 associated with a change in radius @xmath188 is @xmath189 suppose that the contraction associated with a phase - transition in the core of a neutron star leads to @xmath190  m , and that 1% of @xmath187 is radiated as gravitational waves ( which does not seem too unreasonable ) .",
    "then we find that @xmath191 ( assuming @xmath192 ) for a source at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "this is probably too weak to be detected ( at least in the next few years ) .",
    "still , there are several reasons why these scenarios should not be ignored .",
    "first of all , the event may be more violent than i have assumed here .",
    "secondly , a unique event from within our galaxy could be detectable .",
    "given the estimated event rate ( unlikely larger than @xmath193/yr / galaxy ) we would obviously be very lucky to see such an event , but the information that an observation would provide about physics beyond supranuclear density would be extremely valuable .",
    "even though realistic neutron star equations of state do not allow values of @xmath3 much larger than @xmath194 in uniformly rotating neutron stars , several scenarios may lead to a compact star becoming dynamically unstable to the bar - mode .",
    "for example , since @xmath195 one might expect a collapsing star to suffer a triaxial instability at some point during its evolution .",
    "a key parameter that determines the outcome is the degree of differential rotation .",
    "in fact , the maximum attainable @xmath3 changes dramatically if the star is differentially rotating .",
    "this is not surprising since the presence of differential rotation may lead to an increase of the mass - shedding limit by allowing the equator to rotate slower than the central parts of the star .    the critical value at which the bar - mode becomes dynamically unstable remains close to the result for maclaurin spheroids , @xmath159 , for models with varying compressibility",
    "moreover , detailed studies suggest that the onset of instability is in general weakly dependent also on the chosen differential rotation law @xcite .",
    "having said this , there are extreme angular momentum distributions for which @xmath151 becomes very small @xcite , and for which `` spiral instabilities '' tend to dominate .",
    "this is interesting as it indicates that dynamical instabilities could play a role also for relatively slowly rotating stars .",
    "this possibility is illustrated by recent numerical work by centrella et al @xcite .",
    "their simulations of differentially rotating @xmath196 polytropes indicate the presence of a dynamical instability for @xmath197 ( i.e. similar to the point where secular instabilities are expected to set in ) .",
    "the simulations show that an @xmath198 mode plays a dominant role in determining the evolution of the system .",
    "the nature of this instability , i.e. to what extent it is a generic feature , is not yet well understood .",
    "very recent work by shibata et al @xcite supports the notion that dynamical instabilities may operate at very low values of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , they find that a dynamical instability may set in at values as low as @xmath199 !",
    "these intriguing results show that we still have much to learn about the oscillations and instabilities of differentially rotating stars .    in order to study the nonlinear bar - mode evolution",
    "one must resort to large scale numerical simulations .",
    "such work , carried out over the last two decades , shows that the nature of the bar - mode instability depends on the magnitude of @xmath3 compared to the critical value . for large values , @xmath200 , the initial exponential growth of the unstable mode ( on the dynamical timescale )",
    "is followed by the formation of spiral arms .",
    "gravitational torques on the spiral arms lead to the shedding of a mass and angular momentum . through this process",
    "the unstable mode saturates and the star reaches a dynamically stable state . in this scenario",
    "gravitational waves are emitted in a relatively short burst @xcite .",
    "for some time it was thought that this was the generic behaviour , but recent work @xcite indicates that when @xmath3 is only slightly larger than @xmath151 a long - lived ellipsoidal structure may be formed .",

    "most importantly , these results will be affected by differential rotation and general relativistic effects .",
    "[ the f - mode data was provided by lee lindblom.],height=226 ]    to date , there have been three studies of the growth timescale for the unstable relativistic r - modes .",

    "the fully relativistic timescales begin to deviate from the post - newtonian ones as the star reaches the compactness of a typical neutron star , @xmath221 .",

    "however , in order to assess the true relevance of these instabilities we must also consider possible damping effects . in particular , an unstable mode must grow fast enough that it is not completely damped out by viscosity in order to be relevant . to assess the strength of viscous damping one typically considers the effects of bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "these are due to rather different physical mechanisms . at relatively low temperatures ( below a few times @xmath222",

    ", height=226 ]    from the above estimates we can deduce that a gravitational - wave driven instability will only be active in a certain temperature range . to have an instability we need @xmath207 to be smaller in magnitude than both @xmath230 and @xmath231 . from the estimates above we see that shear viscosity will completely suppress the r - mode instability at core temperatures below @xmath232  k. this corresponds to region i in figure  [ window ] .",
    "similarly , bulk viscosity will prevent the mode from growing in a star that is hotter than a few times @xmath233  k. this is the case in region iii of figure  [ window ] . however , if the core becomes very hot ( as in region iv in figure  [ window ] ) , then the star is no longer transparent to neutrinos and the bulk viscosity is strongly suppressed .",
    "this region is likely not very relevant in an astrophysical context as neutron stars will not remain at such extreme temperatures for long enough that an unstable mode can grow to a large amplitude .",
    "finally , in the intermediate region ii in figure  [ window ] , there is a temperature window where the growth time due to gravitational radiation is short enough to overcome the viscous damping and drive the mode unstable .",

    "this possibility caused some excitement and spawned a multitude of studies into the r - modes and the instability mechanism .",
    "much of this work is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the detailed studies illustrate that this is an incredibly difficult problem , and that we need to understand many extremes of physics before we can draw any reliable conclusions regarding the relevance of the unstable r - modes . at the time of writing ,",
    "the most important / interesting problems that need to be approached concern :    neutron stars are likely to be born differentially rotating .",
    "this means that any serious attempt to model their subsequent spin - evolution , eg . driven by a gravitational - wave instability , must be based on the oscillations of a differentially rotating star .",

    "as a neutron star cools below a few times @xmath222  k the extreme density in the core is expected to lead to the formation of various superfluids .",
    "the superfluid constituents play a crucial role in determining the dynamical properties of a rotating neutron star .",
    "in particular , the interplay between the lattice nuclei and the superfluid in the inner crust is a key agent in the standard model for pulsar glitches .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the presence of a superfluid to have a considerable effect also on the various modes of pulsation .",
    "studies of oscillations in superfluid stars have so far been based on models allowing for two distinct , dynamically coupled , fluids .",

    "epstein @xcite ( and later mendell @xcite ) argued , using a simple counting of the fluid degrees of freedom , that there ought to exist a new class of modes in a superfluid star .",
    "these `` superfluid '' modes have the protons moving oppositely to the neutrons , unlike an `` ordinary '' fluid mode that has the neutrons and protons moving more or less together ( see @xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "an important feature of the superfluid problem is that a momentum induced in one of the constituents will cause some of the mass of the other to be carried along . because of this `` entrainment '' , the flow of neutrons around the neutron fluid vortices ( recall that a superfluid mimics large scale rotation by forming a large number of vortices ) will induce a flow in a fraction of the protons , leading to magnetic fields being formed around the vortices .",
    "but since the electrons are coupled to the protons on very short timescales , some electrons will track the entrained protons .",
    "mutual friction is the dissipative scattering of these electrons off of the magnetic fields associated with the vortices @xcite .",
    "superfluid mutual friction has been shown to suppress the instability of the f - mode in a rotating ( newtonian ) star @xcite .",
    "it was originally thought to be the dominant damping agent also on the r - modes , but a calculation by lindblom and mendell @xcite suggests that a typical result for r - mode dissipation due to mutual friction is @xmath238 this would mean that the r - mode instability window is essentially unaffected by the inclusion of mutual friction in the model .",
    "however , @xmath239 is sensitive to changes in the entrainment parameter @xcite , and there seems to be critical values for which the mutual friction timescale becomes very short .",
    "these `` resonances '' are as yet not well understood @xcite and it is clear that much more detailed studies into the pulsation properties of superfluid neutron stars and the associated dissipation mechanisms are needed .",
    "in addition to the core superfluid , we need to consider effects due to the presence of a solid crust in a mature neutron star .",
    "the melting temperature of the crust is usually estimated to be of the order of @xmath233  k ( for a non - accreting star ) , so the crust may form shortly after the neutron star is born .",
    "the presence of a solid crust will have a crucial effect on oscillations of the core fluid .",
    "if the crust is assumed to be rigid the fluid motion must essentially fall to zero at the base of the crust .",
    "one can estimate the relevance of the crust using viscous boundary layer theory @xcite .",
    "the region immediately beneath the crust then corresponds to a so - called ekman layer .",
    "the thickness of the boundary layer ( @xmath240 ) can be deduced by balancing the coriolis force and shear viscosity : @xmath241 where @xmath202 is the shear viscosity coefficient ( [ shearcoeff ] ) . after putting numbers into this relation",

    "has been estimated as @xcite @xmath242 from this estimate one can see that a solid crust would have a greater influence than many other dissipation mechanisms . for example , one finds that all neutron stars with a rigid crust are stable at rotation periods longer than roughly 5  ms , or @xmath243 .",
    "the crust - core interface has been the focus of several recent studies .",
    "these studies add further dimensions to the problem .",
    "the interplay between the r - modes in the fluid core and modes in the solid crust is particularly interesting .",
    "calculations by yoshida and lee @xcite show that as the spin of the star increases the r - modes will undergo a series of so - called avoided crossings with modes that are due to the elasticity of the crust .",
    "furthermore , levin and ushomirsky @xcite have shown that the assumption of a rigid crust , which was made in most estimates of the ekman layer dissipation rate , is not warranted .",
    "they show that the r - mode typically extends into the crust , and as a consequence the true dissipation may well be a factor of perhaps a hundred weaker than ( [ tek2 ] ) .",
    "finally , lindblom et al @xcite have discussed whether r - mode heating at the crust - core interface may melt the crust .",
    "they show that this is likely to be the case , and argue that the outcome may lead to the formation of partly frozen , partly melted crust regions analogous to ice chunks in the arctic .    despite some recent advances in our understanding of the effects that a solid crust may have on the r - modes ,",
    "several crucial issues remain to be investigated in detail .",
    "for example , the inner crust of a neutron star ( out to the neutron drip density ) will likely be permeated by superfluid neutrons .",
    "it is not at all clear at the moment whether one should expect these neutrons to be strongly pinned to the crust nuclei or not @xcite .",
    "but if the superfluid is at all free to move relative to the crust it will likely lead to a weaker ekman layer dissipation on the r - modes .",
    "insights into this problem could also help shed light on the dynamics of pulsar glitches .",
    "given that a strong magnetic field is a key element of neutron star physics it is somewhat surprising that there have been few discussions of the effect that these fields may have on radiation instabilities . particularly since the cfs instability is not unique to gravitational radiation",
    ": any radiative mechanism will do , and it would not be surprising if a detailed investigation were to unveil interesting instabilities driven by electromagnetic radiation . but",
    "even if this does not turn out to be the case , the interplay between a large amplitude pulsation mode and the magnetic field is interesting . especially since the consequences may be observable electromagnetically",
    "of course , it is very difficult to incorporate a realistic magnetic field in a study of neutron star dynamics .",
    "there have been some discussions of magnetic fields in connection with the gravitational - wave instability of the r - modes . in particular concerning the relation between an unstable mode and differential rotation .",
    "spruit @xcite has suggested that gravitational radiation reaction induces strong differential rotation in the star .",
    "this leads to a winding up of the interior magnetic field until a point is reached where the field becomes unstable due to buoyancy .",
    "this scenario was proposed as a model for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the question whether an unstable r - mode leads to differential rotation , and whether the mode can be prevented from growing by the magnetic field was discussed by rezzolla , lamb and shapiro @xcite .",
    "they studied the so - called stokes drift ( due to which fluid elements undergo a secular drift when a wave is present in the system ) , the magnitude of which depends on the latitude of the fluid element and the r - mode amplitude .",
    "key questions concern how this differential drift affects the magnetic field of the star , and what the backreaction on the mode may be .",
    "it was estimated that the instability could operate in young neutron stars ( @xmath244  g ) and recycled ones ( @xmath245  g ) provided that they spin fast enough .",
    "just like in spruit s model , the differential drift due to the r - mode twists the magnetic field which affects its strength and nature .",
    "rezzolla et al predict that the r - mode instability generates strong azimuthal magnetic fields in young pulsars .",
    "several other issues regarding the possible role of the magnetic field were discussed by ho and lai @xcite . in particular , they attempt to quantify the extent to which electromagnetic radiation from the r - modes affects the growth rate of the instability . they find that the electromagnetic driving of the mode would become competitive with gravitational radiation for @xmath246  g. ho and lai also point out that the mode - oscillations will generate alfvn waves in the magnetosphere .",
    "these would strengthen the instability somewhat .",
    "finally , mendell @xcite has extended the crust / core boundary layer approach to the case of a magnetized core .",
    "his results indicate a significant damping of the r - modes for magnetic fields of the order of @xmath247  g and stronger .",
    "these various results indicate that magnetic field effects must be included in any detailed r - mode model , and also point to some potentially interesting repercussions for the instability .",
    "the presence of exotic particles in the core of a neutron star may lead to significantly stronger viscous damping than assumed in the `` standard '' instability analysis @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance may be the presence of hyperons .",
    "jones has estimated that the r - mode instability is almost completely suppressed in a star with a sizeable hyperon core @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the role of hyperons has been carried out by lindblom and owen @xcite .",
    "their results show that the dissipation due to hyperons is , indeed , overwhelming .",
    "most importantly , the hyperon bulk viscosity has the same temperature dependence as the shear viscosity , and thus it limits an instability at low temperatures .",
    "the available estimates suggest that the instability is unlikely to be significant for neutron stars with significant hyperon fractions . however , it is important to emphasize the many uncertainties concerning exotic neutron star cores .",
    "for example , hyperons would act as a very efficient refrigerant .",
    "in fact , a neutron star with a hyperon core should cool rapidly to temperatures much lower than those suggested by observational data .",
    "this discrepancy can be avoided if the hyperons are superfluid and the relevant nuclear reactions are suppressed .",
    "but if this is the case then the bulk viscosity is also suppressed , and in addition one must discuss the role of the additional degree(s ) of freedom that follows with having a star with superfluid components .",
    "interestingly , a strong viscous damping could work in favour of the r - modes as a gravitational - wave source .",
    "this is illustrated by the case of strange stars .",
    "the observational evidence for the existence of strange stars is tenuous , but they may exist if strange matter is indeed the most stable form of matter at high density .",
    "as was first pointed out by madsen @xcite , the r - mode instability is affected by the fact that the bulk viscosity of strange matter is many orders of magnitude stronger than its neutron star counterpart .",
    "this means that the main instability window is located at comparatively low temperatures in a strange star . in figure  [ window ] we would have @xmath248  k and @xmath249 .",
    "the fact that the instability window is shifted to lower temperatures means that an accreting strange star may become a persistent gravitational - wave source once it reaches the spin - rate where the r - modes become unstable .",
    "this possibility will be discussed further in the next section .    to model the gravitational waves associated with a secular instability we need to understand how an unstable mode evolves and what the `` backreaction '' on the bulk of the star is .",
    "this is a very difficult problem .",
    "the early growth phase of an unstable mode can obviously be described by linear theory , but we need to model what happens when the mode enters the nonlinear regime . intuitively , one would expect the growth of the mode to be halted at some finite amplitude .",
    "it seems plausible that the excess angular momentum will be radiated away as the mode saturates , and that the star will spin down as a consequence .",
    "this general picture is supported by studies of instabilities in rotating ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "in particular , lai and shapiro have discussed gravitational - wave signals associated with unstable ellipsoids in great detail .",
    "their evolutions are driven by an unstable f - mode , and they argue that the characteristic gravitational - wave amplitude is @xmath250 as the star spins down , the frequency of the signal varies in such a way that @xmath251 , i.e. it moves through the region where groundbased interferometers will be the most sensitive .",
    "however , equation ( [ fest ] ) is likely overly optimistic because it assumes that the spin - down is governed by an @xmath109 mode .",
    "as discussed above , this mode leads to the fastest instability growth time , but it is not clear that the @xmath109 f - mode will be unstable in a realistic ( compressible ) model . having said that , one should not rule out the possibility since both general relativity and differential rotation tend to destabilize the f - mode .",
    "as far as the unstable r - modes are concerned , most models to date have been phenomenological .",
    "the first such model , developed by owen et al @xcite , was based on expressing the conservation of energy and angular momentum as a system of evolution equations for the bulk rotation rate @xmath2 and the mode - amplitude @xmath129 .",
    "the latter was defined by @xmath252 in order to account for nonlinear mode - saturation it was simply assumed that @xmath129 stopped growing at a suitably large value .",
    "qualitatively , such evolutions would be in accordance with the results for the analogous problem for ellipsoids @xcite .    a key question concerns what the maximum value of @xmath129 is .",
    "in the first studies , it was assumed that @xmath129 could reach values of order unity .",
    "this would lead to a newly born neutron star spinning down significantly on a timescale of a few weeks - months",
    ". the resultant gravitational - wave signal would be detectable by ligoii for sources in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the mode - saturation has recently been investigated in two different ways .",
    "the first studies of this problem were based on fully nonlinear hydrodynamics .",
    "stergioulas and font @xcite carried out a numerical evolution of the exact relativistic euler equations on a background spacetime using a large - amplitude r - mode as initial data .",
    "they found that there was no apparent energy transfer into other modes until @xmath129 was substantially larger than unity .",
    "this result was confirmed by evolutions of the full newtonian hydro equations by lindblom , tohline and vallisneri @xcite . because the actual growth time due to radiation reaction is impractically long , they studied the maximum amplitude for a perturbation driven by an enhanced radiation reaction force @xcite .",
    "they again found saturation at an amplitude large compared to unity .",
    "the limit appeared to be set by a shock wave , a dramatic wave - breaking on the star s surface .",
    "a clear implication of these numerical evolutions was that coupling to other low - order modes did not set a stringent limit on the r - mode amplitude . at least not within the timescale of the evolutions ( about ten rotational periods ) .",
    "to what extent these simulations represent the true physical behaviour was not clear , given the limitations in resolution and evolution time .",
    "ideally , one would want to study the onset of instability and follow the mode through to saturation and see what effect the instability has on the spin of the star .",
    "computationally , this means that one would need a numerical evolution that resolves the mode - oscillation ( on a millisecond timescale ) and tracks the star through hundreds of seconds .",
    "this is not possible given current technology .    a complementary way to address questions concerning nonlinear mode - coupling proceeds via second - order perturbation theory . by omitting higher - order couplings",
    "one can reduce the nonlinear evolution to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the amplitudes of the various modes of the system .",
    "the development of this perturbation theory for rotating stars was a major undertaking , which was recently completed by arras et al @xcite .",
    "they find that a strong resonant coupling to short wavelength inertial modes would lead to r - mode saturation at an amplitude @xmath253 for a canonical star .",
    "this value is two orders of magnitude smaller ( for rotation rates near the kepler limit ) than that used in the early studies of the r - modes @xcite .",
    "this means that the effect of the instability would be much less dramatic .    at first sight",
    "it may seem as if the outcome of the perturbation calculation contradicts the nonlinear evolution results .",
    "however , the work of arras et al @xcite is consistent with the nonlinear evolutions in the sense that the coupling they find to low - order modes would lead to a saturation amplitude of order unity .",
    "it is the coupling to many short - wavelength modes , with frequencies comparable to that of the r - mode , that saturates the mode at a small amplitude .",
    "given the coarse resolution of the numerical grids one would not expect these short wavelength oscillations to show up in the nonlinear evolutions .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the most recent fully nonlinear numerical evolution , due to gressman et al .",
    "@xcite , which shows that increasing the resolution yields rapid nonlinear decay of the mode at decreased amplitude .",
    "this work points the way to future studies of the problem .",
    "the challenge is to test the saturation amplitude predicted by perturbation theory , perhaps via high resolution numerical evolutions . at the present time",
    ", the r - mode saturation remains an issue that requires further detailed consideration .",
    "as discussed in section  [ el_sec ] , viscosity can drive an instability in prograde moving oscillation modes of a spinning star @xcite .",
    "this instability sets in at the point where the rotational corrections to the mode frequency are such that the mode has zero frequency in the rotating frame , cf .",
    "( [ ecrot ] ) .",
    "a viscosity unstable mode lowers the kinetic energy of the star by converting it into heat .",
    "in contrast to the radiation driven instability , this instability is not generic .",
    "the reason for this is that the quadrupole f - mode is the first to go unstable .",
    "higher multipoles require faster rotation to reach their respective instability points .    by an interesting `` coincidence ''",
    "the critical rotation rates for the viscous instability and the radiation driven cfs instability are identical in a rotating newtonian ellipsoid .",
    "both instabilities become active at @xmath145 .",
    "this result no longer holds for compressible stars .",
    "in fact , one finds that the viscous instability will not be present unless the equation of state is unexpectedly stiff .",
    "for example , in newtonian polytropes it is present only if @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "the viscosity driven instability is also not favoured by general relativity .",
    "relativistic effects tend to stabilize the modes that are susceptible to the viscosity instability , and one can show that the instability may operate in @xmath112 relativistic stars only if @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "the neutron star equation of state is expected to be significantly softer than this .",
    "nevertheless , the first relativistic study of the problem @xcite indicates that a subset of the proposed equations of state allow the instability to operate near the mass - shedding limit .",
    "one should also not rule out the possibility that rapidly spinning strange stars may undergo the viscous instability @xcite .",
    "there have only been two studies of the possible gravitational - wave signal from a star undergoing the viscous instability .",
    "almost twenty years ago , ipser and managan @xcite estimated that an energy of @xmath256 would be radiated through a signal with @xmath257 .",
    "the signal would have very narrow bandwidth ( a few hz ) since the star would not migrate far from the bifurcation point ( cf .",
    "figure  [ ellipse ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the viscosity driven instability is likely to exist ( if at all ) only near the mass - shedding limit .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed , and somewhat refined , by lai and shapiro @xcite who considered unstable ellipsoids .",
    "however , it seems likely that damping due to gravitational - wave emission will suppress the viscous instability in all astrophysical neutron stars .",
    "the argument for this is quite simple . just like in the case of the cfs instability",
    "the mechanism that drives the unstable mode must overcome all damping agents . in this case the viscous timescale associated with the unstable mode must be shorter than the gravitational - wave damping timescale . for the modes that are the most likely to suffer the viscosity driven instability ( the prograde moving quadrupole f - modes ) the various timescales will be weakly affected by the stellar rotation .",
    "this means that we can use the non - rotating values to estimate when the viscous timescale is shorter than that of gravitational - wave damping . for the shear viscosity we have @xcite @xmath258 while the gravitational - wave damping should be adequately approximated by ( [ tgwnon ] ) . combining these estimates",
    "we find that we must have @xmath259  k in order to have @xmath260 .",
    "this shows that the viscosity driven instability may only operate in extremely cold neutron stars .",
    "however , neutron stars as cold as this are unlikely to exist in the universe as accretion from the interstellar medium may prevent cooling significantly below @xmath232  k @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to argue that neutron stars should be born rapidly spinning . by simply assuming conservation of angular momentum during the collapse of a solar - mass core from a radius of more than 1000  km to perhaps ten km",
    ", one finds that neutron stars ought to be born rotating as fast as they possibly can , i.e. near the break - up limit .",
    "however , this may be oversimplifying the problem greatly .",
    "in fact , spruit and phinney @xcite have argued that magnetic locking between the core and the envelope of the progenitor star may prevent the collapsing core from spinning rapidly . in their model",
    "the main stellar rotation is due to the `` kick '' mechanism that may also cause a large linear momentum .",
    "consequently , one would expect only a small subset of neutron stars to be born with spin periods shorter than ( say ) 10  ms .",
    "observational data regarding the initial spin rate of young pulsars is not reliable enough to piece together a coherent picture @xcite .",
    "the best studied case is the crab pulsar , whose initial period is estimated ( assuming the standard magnetic braking model ) to have been about 19  ms .",
    "the recently discovered young 16 ms x - ray pulsar in the supernova remnant n157b should have been born spinning faster , but it still probably had an initial period no shorter than a few ms @xcite .",
    "these estimates should be compared to the shortest known period of a recycled pulsar of 1.56  ms , and with the theoretical lower limit on the period of about 0.5 to 2 ms @xcite , depending on the equation of state .    one possible explanation for the absence of young pulsars spinning near the kepler limit could be that rotational instabilities play a significant role in the spin - evolution of nascent neutron stars , leading to a loss of angular momentum during or immediately after the initial collapse .",
    "in this respect the first estimates for the r - mode instability looked promising @xcite .",
    "phenomenological spin - evolution models suggested that the unstable r - modes would be able to spin a newly born neutron star down to a rotation rate of roughly 20  ms , in good agreement with the observations of the crab pulsar .",
    "it was also pointed out @xcite that the r - mode instability might have the consequence that young neutron stars can only reach rotation periods shorter than ( say ) 3 - 5  ms if they are recycled by accretion in a binary system . the alternative model , that these stars are formed by accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf , was not consistent with the r - mode results .",
    "the collapse would simply form a star hot enough that it would be expected to spin down because of the instability . given more detailed studies of the relevant dissipation and mode - saturation mechanisms @xcite it is not clear to what extent the original r - mode scenario is still viable .",
    "the emerging picture is complex , and the outcome depends crucially on physics that is not well understood .",
    "there have not been many fully nonlinear studies aimed at establishing whether rotational instabilities play a role in gravitational collapse scenarios .",
    "the reason for this is that three dimensional studies of rotating core collapse are still prohibitively difficult ( given current computational technology ) .",
    "the issue was , however , discussed by rampp et al @xcite who obtained evidence that instabilities are unlikely to be relevant during the collapse event itself .",
    "they found that there were events in the zwerger - mller collapse catalogue @xcite that led to @xmath164 , and therefore in principle the presence of a dynamically unstable bar - mode , at the time of core bounce .",
    "but since the core tended to reexpand before the unstable mode had time to grow to a large amplitude no enhancement in the gravitational - wave signal was observed .",
    "this may well be a generic feature , and we should perhaps not expect instabilities to emerge from collapse events involving a strong bounce ( at least not until the remnant settles down ) . the strongest gravitational - wave signal estimated from the zwerger - mller data would correspond to a radiated energy of @xmath261 with a characteristic frequency of a few hundred hz .",
    "such a signal is unlikely to be detected from sources beyond the local group of galaxies .",
    "the event rate for such sources is unfortunately very low , with only a few supernovae expected in 100 years in this volume of space .",
    "other studies have provided more promising ( from the gravitational - wave point of view ) results .",
    "houser , centrella and smith @xcite studied the development of unstable bars which grow while the collapse is stalled by the centrifugal force .",
    "their results suggest that as much as @xmath262 could be radiated as gravitational waves . however , since the typical frequency of the waves is in the khz range , this is probably not enough to make the signal detectable from events in the virgo cluster .",
    "furthermore , the study comes with a significant disclaimer since the entire collapse is not followed . the initial configuration chosen for",
    "the simulation may be one that is never actually reached in a `` realistic '' core collapse .",
    "this is an issue that needs to be investigated in more detail in the future : we need to understand what the `` physical '' region of the parameter space is .",
    "it has been suggested that gravitational collapse may under some circumstances be halted by the centrifugal force and/or thermal pressure between white dwarf and neutron star densities . in this region",
    "there are no stable equilibrium configurations . in the original scenario ,",
    "the formed object was assumed to be dynamically but not secularly stable .",
    "this would lead to a phase during which angular momentum is lost due to gravitational - wave driven instabilities .",
    "the system slowly spins down and contracts as angular momentum is lost until a neutron star is formed . since this corresponds to a failed supernova",
    "this non - explosive avenue for neutron star formation became known as a `` fizzler '' .",
    "however , shapiro and lightman @xcite showed that the scenario is unlikely to work for a star governed by a standard `` cold '' equation of state .",
    "the fizzler state will only exist for a part of the evolution  the system will become dynamically unstable before it reaches neutron star densities .",
    "recent work by hayashi et al @xcite revives the idea by showing that the fizzler scenario could work for hot stars .",
    "a rotating configuration that is described by a hot equation of state can be dynamically stable because of the thermal pressure associated with a large lepton fraction .",
    "a preliminary study @xcite indicates that relativistic effects tend to make the formation of fizzlers more difficult , but they can not be ruled out .    in an interesting recent paper , imamura and durisen @xcite have argued that the fizzler evolution it likely to be dominated by dynamical , rather than secular , instabilities .",
    "this result is based on the notion that deleptonization and cooling leads to constraction of the spinning configuration . as a consequence ,",
    "the system approaches the dynamical instability point .",
    "imamura and durisen estimate the energy radiated as gravitational waves during the fizzler phase to be @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the rotation period of the marginally stable state .",
    "fryer et al @xcite have recently argued that the formation of medium size black holes from first generation stars could lead to fizzler - type graviational - wave signals .",
    "the key idea is that angular momentum delays collapse of a @xmath265 core at a radius @xmath266  km .",
    "if a secular instability develops ( as in the original fizzler scenario ) then it could lead to a significant amount of energy being released as gravitational waves .",
    "this may lead to a signal strain of @xmath267  gpc , where the typical distance to the source will be greater than 5  gpc .",
    "the frequency of the waves will be @xmath268 and thus the signal could be of relevance for lisa .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed by new and shapiro @xcite .",
    "they consider the collapse of supermassive stars , with @xmath269 .",
    "should the collapse of such stars be stalled at a radius of @xmath270  m , a secular instability could lead to a gravitational - wave signal of @xmath271 for a source at 1  gpc .",
    "the corresponding wave - frequency would again be @xmath272 .",
    "all the fizzler - type scenarios are interesting , and could well lead to relevant gravitational - wave signals .",
    "but it is clear that much more thought needs to go into the relevant stability criteria and the various viscous dissipation mechanisms that may affect the evolution of the proposed secular / dynamical instabilities .",
    "we also need to establish whether rotating core collapse can lead to the formation of objects in the range @xmath273 .",
    "so far we may only have scratched the surface of this challenging problem .    a secular gravitational - wave driven instability may also play a role in accreting systems .",
    "the possibility that gravitational waves from cfs unstable f - modes could balance the accretion torque , and hence halt the associated spin - up , was first discussed by papaloizou and pringle @xcite and wagoner @xcite .",
    "the analogous scenario for the r - modes was analysed in detail by andersson , kokkotas and stergioulas @xcite ( see also bildsten @xcite ) .",
    "it was originally thought that an accreting star in which an unstable mode could be excited to a significant level would reach a spin - equilibrium where gravitational - wave emission balances the torque .",
    "should this happen , the neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) would be promising sources for detectable gravitational waves .",
    "for example , if gravitational - wave emission provides a limit on the spin of sco  x1 , which is the strongest x - ray source in the sky , and the average accretion rate onto the neutron star is @xmath274 then we can deduce that @xmath275 ( for @xmath276  ms and @xmath277 ) after two weeks worth of signal has been accumulated @xcite . in other words , this kind of source ought the be detectable by large - scale interferometers ( perhaps requiring a narrowbanded advanced detector ) .",
    "however , the original scenario may not work for neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to generating gravitational waves that dissipate angular momentum from the system , the unstable mode will heat the star up ( via the shear viscosity ) . if the viscosity gets weaker as the temperature increases ( as is likely to be the case for an accreting neutron star since the core temperature is expected to be @xmath278  k , which is smaller than @xmath227  k , cf .",
    "figure  [ window ] ) , the mode - heating triggers a thermal runaway and in a few weeks / months the star may spin down to a comparatively low rotation rate .",
    "this could rule out the r - modes in galactic lmxbs as a source of detectable gravitational waves , since they will only radiate for a tiny fraction of the systems lifetime ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , one can show that the instability operates in a different way in strange quark stars @xcite .",
    "because of the significantly stronger bulk viscosity the r - mode instability window shifts towards lower temperatures .",
    "this means that , once the onset of instability is reached , an accreting strange star will reach a quasi - equilibrium state on a timescale of about a year .",
    "hence , the r - modes in an accreting strange star may emit a persistent gravitational - wave signal that would provide unique evidence for the existence of such stars @xcite .",
    "this is an exciting possibility since a proof of the existence of strange stars in the universe would put useful constraints on the parameters of qcd .",
    "very recent results @xcite seem to indicate that accreting neutron stars with a superfluid hyperon core may evolve in a similar way , further strengthening the case for the r - mode instability to be relevant in lmxbs .",
    "the aim of writing this article was to provide an overview of what we currently know about dynamical and secular instabilities in relativistic stars as gravitational - wave sources .",
    "there are many exciting possibilities ( the various estimates are summarized in figure  [ hdiag ] ) and it would be unwise to rule out of the proposed scenarios given our current ( lack of ) knowledge of the detailed physics .",
    "for example , in the case of the r - modes the most recent evidence suggests that i ) the gravitational - wave driven instability may be completely suppressed in a star with a sizeable hyperon core , and ii ) mode - coupling to very short wavelength inertial modes could lead to saturation at low amplitudes .",
    "to what extent these results represent the `` final say '' on these issues is difficult to assess .",
    "first of all , the reliability of the relativistic mean - field equations of state used in the hyperon model is doubted by some nuclear physicists @xcite , and ( if we want to take an extreme point of view ) it is not clear that hyperons will be present at all in a neutron star .",
    "secondly , the mode - coupling estimates were based on a simple barotropic neutron star model . at some level",
    "this assumption will be an oversimplification .",
    "for example , what happens to the mode - coupling if the neutron star core is superfluid ?",
    "it is also important to realize that , even though the main focus of attention has been on the r - modes in the last few years , the secular instability of the f - modes is by no means dead and buried .",
    "the current newtonian evidence may suggest that this instability is less relevant for uniformly rotating stars , but we know that this will change when we account for differential rotation and relativistic effects .",
    "most importantly , if the @xmath109 f - mode becomes unstable it may grow on a timescale comparable to that of the r - mode .",
    "there are also uncertainties concerning the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "key questions concern whether configurations with @xmath279 will ever occur in a realistic collapse scenarios , and whether the recently discovered instabilities that operate at much lower values of @xmath3 are of astrophysical significance .",
    "is compared to the expected sensitivity of the new generation of interferometers ( from top to bottom at the right end of the diagram : geo600 , ligoi , virgo , ligoii ) .",
    "the various source estimates correspond to : r - mode spindown of a nascent neutron star ( assuming the mode can grow to a large enough amplitude and that it survives saturation etcetera ) , the analogous f - mode spindown ( assuming that the @xmath109 mode is unstable ) , gravitational collapse radiating only an energy equivalent to @xmath280 , and black hole formation ( quadrupole qnm ringing assuming an energy of @xmath281 ) .",
    "the bar - mode instability is represented by the grey region , where the upper limit corresponds to a source at 50  kpc and the lower limit to 15  mpc ( the virgo cluster ) .",
    "finally , the square indicates an accreting star which is prevented from spinning up by an unstable r - mode ( assuming parameters relevant for sco x1 ) .",
    ", height=302 ]    if we want to have an accurate decription of the emerging gravitational - wave signals from these scenarios we need to improve our theoretical models considerably .",
    "these are wonderful problems that require an understanding of many extremes of physics for their solution .",
    "the question is if it is realistic to expect us to be able to actually `` solve them '' . in many ways",
    "it seems likely that we will need observational data to put constraints on our theoretical models . as the new interferometers may open the gravitational - wave window to the universe in the next few months ,",
    "it is appropriate to ask to what extent the various theoretical models are falsifiable by observations .",
    "for example , given the current ideas about the r - mode instability one might predict that the mechanism may not operate in an accreting neutron star , but that it could lead to an accreting strange star emitting a more or less persistent gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the detection of such a signal from a galactic lmxb might therefore indicate the presence of a star governed by an `` exotic '' equation of state .",
    "similarly , a newly born neutron star may not undergo a significant r - mode instability phase if it is massive enough to have a large hyperon core .",
    "but if hyperons are not present , or the relevant nuclear reactions are suppressed by the hyperons being superfluid , then the instability may play a role .",
    "there are many such comparisons that one can make , and it is clear that they could provide highly relevant insights into physics at extreme densities .",
    "such results would be very exciting and would truly herald in the new era of `` gravitational - wave astronomy '' .",
