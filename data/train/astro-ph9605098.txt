    "determination of the luminosity of rr lyrae stars is a high priority task in the study of these stars , because they play a key role as distance and age indicators in our galaxy and in its close neighborhood . with the rapid progress of the massive photometry , the number of rr lyrae stars with accurate light curves",
    "will soon be increased by one or two orders of magnitudes . to utilize these data in mapping the not too distant parts of the universe",
    ", we need accurate relations between the physical and the light curve parameters .",
    "several previous attempts tried to tackle this question . in the simplest case",
    "a linear relation is sought for @xmath4 either with [ fe / h ] ( clementini et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) or with [ fe / h ] and the period @xmath5 ( e.g. nemec et al . 1994 ) . from the theoretical side we mention simon and clement ( 1993 ) who used nonlinear pulsation models of rrc stars to derive relations between the fourier parameters and the luminosity .",
    "it is important to note that the often quoted dependence of @xmath4 on [ fe / h ] is suggested by the evolutionary theories and is obtained through an _ ensemble average _ of many evolutionary tracks .",
    "the several empirical variants of this relation suffer from the ambiguity due to the limited number of stars used .",
    "in addition , because of the recently discovered tight dependence of [ fe / h ] on @xmath5 and @xmath1 ( jurcsik and kovcs 1996 , hereafter jk ) , the single parameter dependence of @xmath4 can clearly no longer be hold .    in this paper we follow jk and derive a linear relation for the luminosity of the rrab stars .",
    "up to the zero point , the result is _ free _ of any assumptions and relies solely on the empirical relation between _ directly observed _ quantities .",
    "for the purpose of the empirical determination of the relation between the luminosity and the shape of the light curve , we use the cluster data as compiled by jk . here",
    "we omit the lmc clusters ngc 1835 and 2257 mostly because of the low number of the stars , but also because of their lower quality .",
    "additional data come from the very recent ogle observations of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy and those of the galactic globular clusters ruprecht 106 ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1995a , b ) and m5 ( reid 1996 ) .",
    "we use ( as in jk ) johnson v color throughout this paper . for the absolute calibration",
    "we apply the compilation of the bw luminosities as given by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( their table 21 , column 5 ) .",
    "all these data sets are listed in table 1 . since we use only the best quality light curves without any peculiarity or sign of blazhko behavior , the numbers shown in the table are lower than the ones given for the rrab stars in the respective publications . in the fourier analysis",
    "we follow the same method as outlined in jk . reddening",
    "corrections are applied only in the case of m4 , because of its considerable differential extinction ( cacciari 1979 ; liu and janes 1990 ) .",
    "first we use only the globular cluster and the sculptor data and do not rely on the bw luminosities . in finding the relation between the fourier parameters and the luminosity we follow essentially the same method as in jk .    here",
    "we utilize on the fact that the distance moduli are the same for all stars in each cluster .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the same thing is true also for the reddenings . since the luminosity should follow a general relation , independently of the cluster considered , for a consistent representation of the apparent magnitudes we fit a certain number of fourier parameters and @xmath7 constants , where @xmath8 is the number of clusters . including the period and all the fourier amplitudes and phases up to order 6",
    ", we search for the best linear relation representing the observed ( _ intensity averaged _ ) brightness . in this way we get an optimum set of _ reddened relative distance moduli",
    "_ , and a formula representing the relation between the light curve and the absolute magnitude .",
    "stars with discrepant luminosities are left out of the fit .",
    "we do not discuss these stars in detail , we only remark that there might be several reasons for their peculiarity , e.g. crowding effects , inhomogeneous extinction , blazhko behavior , etc . although the fairly high noise level introduces some ambiguity in the selection process , we try to avoid it by keeping as many stars as possible , and reaching a situation when both the fitting accuracy and the regression coefficients seem to settle on a stationary value .",
    "we think that we reach this state by omitting 5 stars from the globular clusters and 7 stars from sculptor .",
    "finally we end up with 177 stars . since the fitting accuracy shows a leveling off when using more than 3 fourier parameters ( cf .",
    "table 3 ) , we settle on the following formula which fits the data with an accuracy of 0.047 mag @xmath9 to obtain an absolute calibration , we repeat the above process by including also the bw stars . we emphasize that we use the bw stars merely to _ fix the zero point_. we find that the bw luminosities of the following stars do not confine to the basic trend of the clusters : wy ant , uu cet , dx del , ss leo , av peg , bb pup , w tuc , m5 v28 , m92 v1 , v3 . after leaving out these stars",
    ", we get a set of 198 stars which we refer hereafter as the _ calibrating data set_. this yields the following expression @xmath10 with the corresponding error formula @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the correlation coefficients @xmath16 are given in table 2 . in this formula",
    "we have omitted the completely negligible error of the period .",
    "we recall , that just as in jk , the fourier parameters refer to a _ sine _ decomposition and that the phase should be chosen as the closest value to 5.1 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the calculated vs. the observed absolute magnitudes for the best single and the above three parameter fits .",
    "the observed absolute magnitudes are calculated by the use of the apparent brightnesses and the computed reddened distance moduli .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of the fourier parameters caused a visible improvement in the representation of the data compared with that of the traditional period ",
    "luminosity relation .",
    "it is important to address the question of the significance of the three parameter relation over the two parameter one . in order to do so",
    ", we generate artificial data with the following formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a gaussian random number with @xmath19 . the regular part of eq .",
    "( 4 ) corresponds to the best two parameter fit to the calibrating data set and the indices run through this set . for each realization of @xmath20",
    "we find the best @xmath8 parameter fit just like in the case of real data . denoting the _ unbiased _ estimation of the standard deviation of the best @xmath8 parameter fit by @xmath21 ,",
    "we ask what is the probability that the relative reduction of @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) exceeds a certain limit when the three and two parameter fits are compared . after a large number of simulations , the distribution function shown in fig . 2 is obtained .",
    "this can be used to estimate the significance of @xmath23 obtained in the case of the observed data of the calibrating set ( table 3 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath23 is about 3 times greater than the maximum reduction of the dispersion found in the random simulation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the three parameter formula ( 2 ) is statistically _ highly significant _ in the representation of the luminosity .",
    "in addition , as can be seen in table 3 , the fitting accuracy clearly levels off for the higher parameter regressions .",
    "this shows that the three parameter description not only necessary , but also sufficient for the representation of the observations .",
    "finally we mention that because of the close interrelations among the amplitudes and phases ( see jk ) , there exist compatible formulae which contain other fourier components . our eq .",
    "( 2 ) has not only the highest fitting accuracy , but also contains low order fourier components , which helps to diminish observational errors .",
    "in deriving an average @xmath24 } \\rightarrow m_v$ ] relation we utilize the fact that with the aid of the formula of jk and eq .",
    "( 2 ) we are able to estimate both [ fe / h ] and @xmath4 for any rrab star with reliable fourier decomposition . using all data of this paper and those of jk we get the result shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath24 } \\rightarrow m_v$ ] relation suffers from a considerable _ intrinsic scatter _ , due to the extra dependence on the fourier parameters .",
    "the straight line is a least squares fit and corresponds to the following expression @xmath25 } + 1.04 \\hskip 2 mm .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula is in a nice agreement with the recent bw results as summarized by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and also with the evolutionary calculations ( e.g. lee 1990 ) . since eq .",
    "( 2 ) depends somewhat on the sample of stars used in its derivation , this dependence translates to eq .",
    "our experiences show that for all reasonable samples the coefficients of eq .",
    "( 5 ) are always in the ranges of 0.19  0.16 and 1.04  0.99 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , changing our greater values of [ fe / h ] to the lower spectroscopic ones for m68 , m92 and ngc 1841 , we get only a slight decrease in the coefficients , namely they become 0.18 and 1.03 respectively .",
    "therefore , our results _ undoubtedly exclude _ large [ fe / h ] coefficients as it is sometimes quoted in the literature ( buonanno et al .",
    "1990 ; longmore et al . 1990 ; sandage 1993 ) .",
    "( 2 ) it is easy to get reddened distance modulus which can be directly ( i.e. _ without _ reddening correction ) applied to estimate the age of a cluster if the apparent turn - off luminosity @xmath26 is known .",
    "the results are shown in table 4 .",
    "the distance moduli and the apparent turn - off luminosities are _ reddened _ , except for m4 , where reddening was taken into account as mentioned in section 2 .",
    "errors of the distance moduli correspond to the standard deviations of the distance moduli obtained for the stars in each cluster .",
    "superscripts refer to the sources of @xmath26 .",
    "abundances are calculated according to jk . to estimate the ages we apply the formula of straniero and chieffi ( 1991 , their eq .",
    "we recall that using the reddened distance moduli and the observed ( also reddened ) @xmath26 , the absolute magnitude of the turn - off , @xmath27 and therefore , the age can be directly estimated without the resort to an additional observable ( i.e. the mean brightness difference between the horizontal branch and the turn - off point , the estimation of which introduces further ambiguities @xmath28 see caputo and deglinnocenti 1995 ) .",
    "the formal errors of the ages are between 1 and 2 gyr .",
    "we remark that according to our formula , m5 and rup 106 exhibit a relatively large spread in the metallicity with @xmath29 } \\approx 0.2 $ ] .    because it is not the subject of this paper to discuss the ages of globular clusters",
    ", we just mention that there is an _ age spread _ among them , as it has also been stated by other studies applying low steepness in the @xmath24 } \\rightarrow m_v$ ] relation ( e.g. walker 1992b ) .",
    "on the basis of the latest observational material we have shown that the luminosity of rrab stars depends on three observables , namely on the period and on the fourier parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( eq . ( 2 ) ) .",
    "the relative accuracy of the estimated absolute v magnitudes are better than @xmath30 mag , the standard deviation of the residuals of the calibrating data set .",
    "this is comparable to the corresponding value of the @xmath31 regressions obtained from infrared photometry ( longmore et al .",
    "1990 ; jones et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we think that a considerable part of the scatter comes from the inhomogeneous reddening inside the clusters . in the absolute calibration",
    "there is still an error probably smaller than @xmath32 mag both in @xmath4 and in @xmath33 , because they all rely on the baade - wesselink results .",
    "our average @xmath24 } \\rightarrow m_v$ ] relation ( eq . ( 5 ) ) yields a similar dependence on [ fe / h ] than those given by the recent baade - wesselink and evolutionary studies .",
    "we think that future , more accurate ccd measurements in clusters or galaxies with large [ fe / h ] spread will drastically improve the correlation between the luminosity and the fourier parameters .",
    "this will enable us to determine the luminosity of _ any _ rrab star , provided that we can measure its light curve with a reliable accuracy .",
    "we are very much indebted to janusz kaluzny for sending us the data on sculptor and on ruprecht 106 , which were recently obtained within the framework of the ogle project .",
    "grateful acknowledgements are also due to neill reid for his excellent data on m5 .",
