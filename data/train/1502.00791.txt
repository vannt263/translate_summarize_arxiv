    "after the success of the hipparcos astrometry mission @xcite , culminating in the hipparcos and tycho catalogues @xcite , esa has recently launched the gaia spacecraft @xcite .",
    "gaia s main goal is to unravel the formation history , evolution , structure , and dynamics of our galaxy , the milky way , through measuring the positions , motions , and astrophysical parameters of the brightest 1,000 million stars in the sky .",
    "in addition , gaia will provide unique contributions to the study of solar - system bodies , fundamental physics @xcite , external galaxies , the reference frame , the transient universe @xcite , stellar structure , physics , and evolution , variable stars @xcite , double and multiple stars @xcite , young , massive stars ( rygl et al .",
    ", this volume ) , brown dwarfs @xcite , white dwarfs @xcite , open clusters @xcite , globular clusters @xcite , the distance scale , exo - planets @xcite , and so forth .",
    "gaia will continuously scan the heavens during its five - year nominal lifetime , which started on 25 july 2014 , and the first , intermediate catalogue is expected in 2016 ( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release ) . a review of the gaia mission , including an overview of its payload , is given in de bruijne et al .",
    "the main gaia website is http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia .",
    "the expected characteristics of the gaia data have been subject to numerous studies .",
    "the particular question of how the expected standard errors of single , well - behaved stars depend on magnitude and colour of the source  as well as on position in the sky  has been answered by de bruijne ; the expected astrometric correlations have been discussed in detail by holl et al .  .",
    "these studies , however , were concluded prior to gaia s launch and are hence based on the pre - launch predictions of the telescope and payload behaviour . during the in - orbit commissioning phase of the mission , however , three surprises showed up ( prusti , this volume ) :    1 .",
    "there is significant stray light , which periodically varies with time ; 2 .",
    "the transmission of the optics slowly degrades with time ( currently at a rate of @xmath340  mmag per 100  days ) as a result of contamination by water ice ; 3 .",
    "the intrinsic instability of the basic angle  which separates the lines of sight of the two telescopes  is larger than expected .",
    "issue 2 is kept under control by ( semi-)periodically heating the payload to decontaminate the optics and only impacts the end - of - life performance at a level of @xmath3@xmath4% ; this can hence be considered to be covered by the @xmath5% `` science margin '' that is included in all performance predictions .",
    "issue 3 is kept under control through the basic - angle - monitor device @xcite which allows to measure the variations in the basic angle and inject this information into the astrometric global iterative solution .",
    "issue 1 , on the other hand , is accompanied with increased noise levels and hence _ does _ lead to an irreversible degradation of the end - of - life astrometric ( and also photometric and spectroscopic  cropper et al .",
    ", this volume ) standard errors , as quantified in this paper .",
    "the gaia accuracy analysis tool has been run for 451 straylight levels ranging between 0 ( no straylight ) and 100  e@xmath6  pixel@xmath7  s@xmath7 . for each straylight level",
    ", 300 monte - carlo centroiding experiments have been performed for each combination of the : two telescopes , 62 astrometric ccd detectors , 16 stars with various spectral types ranging from b1v to m6v , two different interstellar extinctions ( 0 and 5 mag ) , and 9 different @xmath8 magnitudes between @xmath9 and @xmath10 mag .",
    "the results of the @xmath3@xmath11  billion centroiding experiments have been re - arranged and averaged to provide the ratio of the ccd - level centroiding error at a certain straylight level compared to the reference case of no straylight , referred to as the `` performance - degradation factor '' , as function of gaia white - light @xmath1 magnitude as defined in jordi et al . .",
    "the performance - degradation factor as function of straylight level and @xmath1 magnitude is displayed in figure  [ fig : parametric_study ] .",
    "for instance , it follows that , with a hypothetical , omni - present straylight level of 80  e@xmath6  pixel@xmath7  s@xmath7 during the full mission duration , gaia s parallax standard error at @xmath12  mag would degrade by a factor 4 ( turquoise colour ) .",
    "cccccccccc + @xmath1 [ mag ] & @xmath13@xmath14 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 +   +   + @xmath15 [ @xmath16as ] & 5.0 & 7.7 & 12.3 & 19.8 & 32.4 & 55.4 & 102 & 208 & 466 +   + @xmath0 [ @xmath16as ] & 6.7 & 10.3 & 16.5 & 26.6 & 43.6 & 74.5 & 137 & 280 & 627 +   + @xmath17 [ @xmath16as  yr@xmath7 ] & 3.5 & 5.4 & 8.7 & 14.0 & 22.9 & 39.2 & 72.3 & 147 & 330 +   +    the distribution of straylight levels measured during commissioning , in units of e@xmath6  pixel@xmath7  s@xmath7 and averaged over all pixel columns of all ccds in the astrometric focal plane , is displayed in figure  [ fig : observed_statistics ] .",
    "the median straylight level is 5.5  e@xmath6  pixel@xmath7  s@xmath7 and only 10% of the distribution has straylight levels in excess of 20  e@xmath6  pixel@xmath7  s@xmath7 . by combining the results displayed in figures  [ fig : parametric_study ] and [ fig : observed_statistics ] , the predicted , sky - average , end - of - mission parallax standard error as function of @xmath1 magnitude as displayed in table  [ tab : errors ] and in figure  [ fig : curve ] follows",
    "we find that , following the pre - launch investigation , the predicted , post - launch , sky - average , end - of - mission parallax standard error is well represented by ( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance ) : @xmath19 = ( -1.631 + 680.766 \\cdot z + 32.732 \\cdot z^2)^{1/2 } \\cdot [ 0.986 + ( 1 - 0.986 ) \\cdot ( v - i)],\\ ] ] where @xmath20.\\label{eq : z}\\ ] ] the @xmath2 colour term represents the widening of the point spread function at longer wavelengths .",
    "the above equations are valid in the range @xmath2120  mag .",
    "stars fainter than 20  mag are ( routinely ) observed but their end - of - mission number of transits resulting in usable data on ground may be reduced as a result of crowding , on - board priority management , on - board magnitude - estimation errors , finite on - board detection and confirmation probabilities , etc .",
    "their standard errors will hence be ( much ) larger than predicted through this model .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath22  mag will be observed with a special mode with associated non - trivial calibration challenges @xcite ; the end - of - life astrometric standard errors for these stars will amount to at least several dozens of @xmath16as . for stars between @xmath13 and @xmath23  mag , reduced ccd integration times ( through the use of time - delayed - integration ",
    "tdi  gates ) will be used to limit saturation . for these stars ,",
    "the end - of - mission performance depends sensitively on the adopted tdi - gate scheme , which depends on ccd and on across - scan location inside the ccd , as well as on magnitude ; in addition , on - board magnitude - estimation errors will cause a given bright star sometimes to be observed with the `` wrong '' tdi gate .",
    "the max function in equation  ( [ eq : z ] ) allows to ignore these `` complications '' and returns a constant parallax noise floor , at @xmath24as , for stars with @xmath25  mag .",
    "the pre - launch relations between sky - average parallax standard error and position and proper - motion standard errors have not changed : @xmath26 where @xmath15 denotes the position error at mid - epoch in @xmath16as and @xmath17 denotes the ( annual ) proper - motion error in @xmath16as  ( yr@xmath7 ) .",
    "the dependence of the astrometric errors on celestial coordinates as described in de bruijne is also still valid .",
    "one should finally keep in mind that the current assessment exclusively takes the increased photon noise caused by the straylight into account . since we do not have and",
    "hence can not include a sophisticated calibration - error model , the performance estimates presented here do not include the ( potential ) additional performance degradation caused by increased estimation errors of the background levels around the stars , which are needed as input parameters in the image - parameter determination / centroiding / location estimation .",
    "although the size of this additional degradation factor will not be known until significant stretches of real data have been processed and ( iteratively ) calibrated , it is expected that this effect will fit , even when combined with the transmission loss mentioned in section  [ sec : com ] , into the @xmath5% `` science margin '' which has been included in all predictions .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the conference organisers , in particular nic walton and francesca figueras , for the enjoyable meeting .",
    "michael davidson ( edinburgh ) kindly provided the frequency distribution of the straylight levels measured during the commissioning of the gaia spacecraft .",
    "the commissioning phase was supported by gaia s prime contractor , airbus defence & space , and by gaia s mission operations centre ( esoc ) , gaia s science operations centre ( esac ) , gaia s project team ( estec ) , gaia s project scientist support team ( estec ) , the data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac , in particular the payload experts ) , and the dpac project office ( po ) ."
