    "the inflationary phase of the early universe  @xcite is a very important ingredient in modern cosmology .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , inflation solves the longstanding problems of standard hot big - bang cosmology , namely the horizon , flatness and monopole problems .",
    "furthermore , it produces the primordial perturbations for the structure that we observe today .",
    "the recent spectacular cmb data from the wmap satellite  @xcite have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an _ almost _ scale - free spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation .    in the prospect of future cmb experiments , like  @xcite , constructing inflationary models which predict detectable primordial gravitational waves",
    "( tensor - to - scalar ratio ) and non - gaussianities has attracted a lot of interest lately . as far as tensor - to - scalar ratio is concerned , at present",
    "the limit is @xmath0 and it easy to build inflationary models that predict negligible tensor perturbations .",
    "however , it would be interesting to have at our disposal models which predict a tensor - to - scalar ratio at the future detection limit , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as it is known that current superstring inflationary models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) predict negligible tensor perturbations  @xcite ( see however  @xcite ) , this would be challenging for testing string theory . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that single field inflationary models with a minimally coupled scalar field predict primordial non - gaussianities at a non - detectable level  @xcite , since the non - linear parameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , the planck satellite is expected to detect the non - linear parameter if @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why great effort is devoted to the construction of inflationary models which predict large non - gaussianities  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we show that a simple model with a single scalar field and with a non - trivial kinetic term can lead to detectable tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 and non - linear parameter @xmath5 .",
    "scalar field models with a non - canonical kinetic term have been discussed in k - inflation  @xcite , in which inflation is not due to the potential but rather to the kinetic term in the lagrangian , and in k - essence models  @xcite , which are designed to address the issue why the cosmic acceleration has recently begun .",
    "a previous work  @xcite is closely related to ours . in this",
    ", the authors have shown that within the same class of models it is possible to have enhanced production of gravitational waves without conflict with observations .",
    "however , non - gaussianities are not - discussed in this paper and in fact , as we will show below , the particular model  @xcite predicts negligible @xmath6 .",
    "the reason for that is that in the model of  @xcite the sound speed @xmath7 . in the present work",
    "however we study a different model in which the sound speed can be very low , @xmath8 , and therefore it is possible to have large @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the same time .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "the article consists of four sections , of which this introduction is the first .",
    "we present the basic formula in the second section and then we discuss slow - roll inflation in a simple model in section 3 . finally the fourth section is devoted to some conclusions .",
    "our framework is four - dimensional general relativity coupled to a single scalar field with a general lagrangian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scalar field and @xmath11 is the standard kinetic term .",
    "therefore , our model is described by the action @xmath12 and we have set newton s constant @xmath13 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the scalar field is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "we can recast this energy - momentum tensor into the form of the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the energy density and the pressure of the fluid respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamical quantities @xmath19 are given in terms of @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 in the case in which the lagrangian of the scalar field is of the form @xmath22 , the energy density is given by @xmath23 therefore , the equations of motion for our system are just the first friedmann equation and the equation for energy conservation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hubble parameter , @xmath26 is the scale factor and the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time . defining the sound speed of the scalar field @xmath27 the equation for energy conservation takes the form @xmath28 which generalizes the usual klein - gordon equation of a canonical scalar field in a friedmann - robertson - walker background .",
    "during the slow - roll phase the inflationary dynamics can be quantified in terms of the three parameters @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the reduced planck mass ( in the units we are using here @xmath33 ) and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the scalar field .",
    "we assume that @xmath34 during the slow - roll inflationary phase . furthermore , assuming that @xmath22 the equations of motion in the slow - roll approximation take the form @xmath35 since we ignore @xmath36 in the equation of motion for the scalar field , and @xmath37 is the dominant term in the expression for the energy density . upon considering a concrete model in which @xmath38",
    "we find that the speed of sound is a constant and given by @xmath39 and it can be very low for large @xmath40 , @xmath41 . in addition , the equations of motion now take the form @xmath42 notice that in this model @xmath43 and the end of inflation is determined by the condition @xmath44 .",
    "finally we define the number of e - folding @xmath45 as well as the quantities that connect the theoretical model to observations .",
    "these are the spectral index and the amplitude of perturbations both for scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "the perturbations in k - inflation in linear order have been computed in  @xcite . in linear perturbation theory",
    "the scalar and tensor perturbations evolve independently from each other and therefore scalar perturbations can not produce gravitational waves",
    ". however this is possible if second order effects are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "since k - inflation generalizes the usual inflation with a canonical scalar field , we expect that we could study the generation of gravitational waves by second order effects in k - inflation generalizing the results of  @xcite .",
    "this however lies beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the indices and amplitudes of scalar and tensor perturbations are given by @xmath46 the tensor - to - scalar ratio is defined by @xmath47 and is given by @xmath48 in standard inflation ( @xmath49 ) the tensor spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are not independent , and one has the so - called `` consistency relation ''  @xcite , @xmath50 , which in principle can be tested against observations .",
    "however , in k - inflation this relation does not hold any more . instead of that we have @xmath51 .",
    "thus , at least in principle , kinetic inflation is phenomenologically distinguishable from standard inflation  @xcite .",
    "if in fact @xmath52 the production of gravitational waves is substantially larger than expected in standard inflationary models .",
    "this was pointed out in  @xcite .    as in  @xcite ,",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field in the slow - roll approximation can be easily solved and the solution corresponds to a constant kinetic term @xmath16 .",
    "however , this is not important for what we would like to point out",
    ". furthermore , we are not going to concern ourselves with the amplitude of scalar perturbations or the scalar spectral index , since in the present work our main interest is being on the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the non - gaussianity .",
    "we just remark in passing that the observable quantities , @xmath53 etc , depend on the three model parameters @xmath54 through the slow - roll parameters . for a given value of @xmath40 or @xmath55 we can determine the values of @xmath56 by requiring that we must reproduce the observable values of @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". then we can compute the rest of the observable quantities , namely the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 and the non - linear parameter @xmath6 , to which we now turn .",
    "let us now focus on the primordial non - gaussianity . a rough measure of the non - gaussianities is provided by the non - linear parameter @xmath6 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gravitational potential which sources the temperature anisotropies in the cmb  @xcite . in our model the parameter @xmath6 in leading order is given by  @xcite @xmath61 according to  @xcite",
    ", @xmath6 is given by the expression @xmath62 where @xmath63 for usual inflation with a canonical scalar field , @xmath64 and therefore @xmath65 as we mentioned before .",
    "in dbi inflation  @xcite @xmath66 are different than zero and the sound speed @xmath67 . in a generic k - essence model @xmath66 are also different than zero , but the sound speed can be either larger than unity , @xmath7 or lower than unity , @xmath67 . in our model in the present work @xmath68 constant , @xmath69 , @xmath8 and @xmath70 different than zero .",
    "it easy to see that for a large sound speed , @xmath71 , the non - linear parameter @xmath72 , which is just one order of magnitude compared to the canonical scalar field case , @xmath73 , while for a tiny sound speed , @xmath8 , the non - linear parameter @xmath74 . in this case @xmath6 can be much greater and therefore within the detectable range .",
    "for example , let us consider a case in which @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then we obtain for @xmath4 and @xmath6 the values @xmath78 either of which is within the detectable range . in the figure below",
    "we show @xmath6 as a function of @xmath4 and with the two horizontal lines we show the region that corresponds to a detectable range both for @xmath4 and @xmath6 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fact our discussion shows that even the form of the potential @xmath79 is not important .",
    "what is important here is the form of the kinetic term , @xmath80 .",
    "the key quantity in the present work is the sound speed and the two facts that it is constant and that is may become low enough so that we can have a large non - linear parameter @xmath6 , but not a negligible tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 . therefore we expect that in our simple inflationary model it is possible to obtain both @xmath4 and @xmath6 in the detectable range independently of the form of the inflaton potential @xmath81 .",
    "a final remark regarding the sound speed is in order here .",
    "it is known that for a canonical scalar field the speed of sound equals unity .",
    "however in models with a general scalar field the speed of sound can be different from unity and in fact it can even be @xmath82 .",
    "for a recent discussion on superluminal fields and causality one can see  @xcite . in our work",
    "we have considered a case in which the speed of sound is very small , @xmath8 . in the past",
    "k - essence models received some criticism because of possible superluminal propagation of the field fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however it was shown recently that causal paradoxes do not arise in this kind of models  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have studied slow - roll inflation with a single scalar field and non - trivial kinetic term for the inflaton . in particular , we have considered a simple concrete model in which the lagrangian for the generalized scalar field is of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath83 is the non - trivial kinetic term and @xmath79 is the inflaton potential . in this model",
    "the speed of sound is constant and it can be very low for @xmath41 .",
    "we have shown that in this simple model it is possible to have large tensor - to - scalar ratio and large primordial non - gaussianities .",
    "this is a potentially interesting result in the prospect of new forthcoming observations .",
    "in fact our main result is probably true for any form of the inflaton potential @xmath81 , as it turns out that the crucial point in our discussion is the form of the non - trivial kinetic term .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for his / her valuable comments and suggestions .",
