    "gravitational lenses are valuable tools in many astrophysical applications . one of them is to study the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the lens galaxies at the locations where we observe the quasar images . by studying the _ differences _ in the absorption ( or extinction ) between multiple images , any contamination from the galaxy in the foreground or the quasar host galaxy in the background is essentially eliminated and we can be confident that we are probing the ism of the lens galaxy . several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite and @xcite measured the differential column densities in two lenses q  2237 + 0305 and b  1600 + 434 using a similar method . by combining the x - ray and optical measurements of the differences in gas and dust properties between the lensed images",
    ", we can estimate the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath8 of the lens galaxies assuming the differences between the extinction and gas absorption are due to the same parcel of the ism .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio , normally calculated from @xmath9 , is a basic property of the ism , but our direct knowledge of dust - to - gas ratios is largely based on our own galaxy . in particular , @xcite measured the dust - to - gas ratios of the ism towards 100 stars in the milky way and found a correlation of @xmath10 mag @xmath11 atoms@xmath5 with typical scatter of @xmath1230% .",
    "subsequent studies have extended these measurements to additional lines of sight in our galaxy and to the lmc and smc , but the basic results are little altered aside from some evidence that the dust - to - gas ratios of the lmc and smc are modestly lower ( @xmath13% ) than in the galaxy ( see the review by draine 2003 and references therein ) . however , because of the difficulties in determining the absorption column densities and the extinction of distant galaxies , little is known about the dust - to - gas ratios of their ism . just as with studies of extinction laws , gravitational lenses provide the first potential probe for studying the dust - to - gas ratios of cosmologically distant galaxies ( @xmath14 ) with the precision of studies of the ism in the galaxy .",
    "here we measure the differential column density of three additional lenses and combine them with existing measurements for two lenses to estimate the average dust - to - gas ratio of the lens galaxies .",
    "over twenty gravitational lenses have been observed in x - rays with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  @xcite . from these systems , we selected the seven systems from the @xcite survey of extinction in lens galaxies with differential extinction measurements exceeding @xmath15 mag . for two of these systems ,",
    "lbqs  1009@xmath00252 and mg  2016 + 112 , the _ chandra _  spectra of the individual images contain too few photons to allow an analysis of differential absorption , and the differential absorptions in b  1600 + 434 and q  2237 + 0305 have been reported previously @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the remaining three lenses , mg  0414 + 0534 , he  1104@xmath01805 , and pks  1830@xmath0211 .",
    "mg  0414 + 0534  and he  1104@xmath01805  were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board _ chandra _  for 97 and 49 ks on january 8 , 2002 and june 10 , 2000 , respectively .",
    "pks  1830@xmath0211  was observed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and acis on board _ chandra _  for 51 ks on june 25 , 2001 .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data were reduced with the ` ciao ` software tools provided by the _ chandra _  x - ray center ( cxc ) following the standard threads on the cxc website . only events with standard _ asca _  grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were used in the analysis .",
    "we improved the image quality of the data by removing the pixel randomization applied to the event positions by the standard pipeline .",
    "in addition , we applied a subpixel resolution technique @xcite to the events on the s3 chip of acis where the lensed images are located .",
    "we extracted spectra for each of the lensed quasar images .",
    "although the pks  1830@xmath0211  observation was a grating observation , we simply analyzed the spectra obtained from the zeroth order image to extract and study spectra of the two quasar images separately .",
    "we did not analyze the grating spectrum of pks  1830@xmath0211  because it can not resolve the spectra of the two images , which is essential in this study .",
    "we fitted the spectra of the lensed quasars using ` xspec v11.3.1 ` @xcite over the 0.38 kev observed energy range .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the @xmath16th image can be generally modeled as @xmath17{\\hbox{${n}_{\\rm h}$}}_{,i}-\\sigma\\left[e(1+z_s)\\right]{\\hbox{${n}_{\\rm h}$}}_{,src}(t-\\delta t_i)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the number of photons per unit energy interval , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the equivalent hydrogen column density at our galaxy , the lens galaxy at image @xmath16 , and the source galaxy , @xmath22 is the photo - electric absorption cross - section , and @xmath23 is the time - delay .",
    "the difference between the absorption at the lens , @xmath24 , can be obtained by analyzing the individual spectra of the lensed images .",
    "we neglected the time - delay between the images and the absorption at the source redshift in this analysis .",
    "we used the standard ` wabs ` and ` zwabs ` models in ` xspec ` to model the galactic absorption and absorption at the lens redshift .",
    "the ` wabs ` and ` zwabs ` models use cross sections from @xcite and assume a solar elemental abundance from @xcite .",

    "chandra _  observation .",
    "the a1 and a2 images are too close ( 04 apart ) to obtain the individual spectra of the images .",
    "we modeled the spectra with a power - law modified by absorption at the lens and galactic absorption .",
    "the galactic absorption was fixed as @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "we fitted the three spectra simultaneously using the same power - law photon index for all spectra but differing amounts of absorption at the lens redshift for each image .",

    "our estimate of the power - law photon index , @xmath28 , is consistent with the range of values from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mg ] shows the spectra of the three images and their best fit models .",
    "it is clear from the spectra that the spectrum of image a is more heavily absorbed than that of images b and c. we estimate that the differences in the column densities are @xmath29  , @xmath30  and @xmath31  .",
    "we used ` xspec ` to explore the full parameter space of the column densities in order to correctly estimate the uncertainties in the differential column densities .",
    "we also verified that adding absorption in the source does not alter the estimates of the differential column densities between the images in the lens galaxy .",

    "the differential extinction between images b and c is very small .",
    "the differential extinction between image a1 and a2 is large with @xmath44  mag .",
    "we used the two brightest images to estimate the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "because we only analyzed the x - ray spectrum of the image a ( a1 and a2 combined ) , we used an average differential extinction of @xmath45  mag between images a and b in our dust - to - gas ratio estimate .",
    "combined with our differential absorption measurement , we obtained a dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath46 mag @xmath4 atoms@xmath5 .",
    "the error - bar was estimated by replacing the average differential extinction with values for the a1 and a2 images .",
    "this ambiguity dominates any interpretation of the differential absorption measurement .",
    "he  1104@xmath01805  is a two - image lens discovered by @xcite with a source redshift of @xmath47 @xcite and a lens redshift of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the two images are well separated ( @xmath49 32 ) , so we can easily extract the individual spectra of both images .",
    "the combined spectrum of both images of he  1104@xmath01805  was previously analyzed by @xcite . in fitting the combined spectrum , as done by @xcite",
    ", the low total absorption obtained indicates that adding a small component of galactic absorption ( @xmath50  ) suffices to fit the data with a power law index of @xmath51 for the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "we again see the advantages of using differential measurements to eliminate ambiguities as to the location of the absorption .",
    "we obtained a differential column density between the two images of @xmath52  ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) by placing the absorption at the lens redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : he ] shows the spectra of the two images and their best fit models .",
    "the power - law photon index , @xmath53 , obtained in this model is slightly harder than the values from @xcite .",
    "curiously , we find that image a shows more absorption than image b , which is the reverse of the differential extinction estimated by @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to chromatic microlensing of the images by the stars in the lens galaxy being misinterpreted as extinction , but it could also be explained by giving the ism very different dust - to - gas ratios at the positions of the two images .",
    "recent observations of he  1104@xmath01805  ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ; gmez - lvarez et al .",
    "2004 ) indicates that the chromaticity disappears when the microlensing perturbations decrease , supporting the chromatic microlensing interpretation .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the amount of ism varied between the optical and x - ray observations . however , considering the short time - scale , it is unlikely that the ism of a normal galaxy would vary significantly . in any case",
    ", we will be unable to include this lens in an estimate of the mean dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "pks  1830@xmath0211  @xcite consists of two @xmath54 @xcite quasar images separated by 1  and lensed by a @xmath55 @xcite spiral galaxy @xcite . using our standard method , but applying it to the zeroth order hetgs image , we find that @xmath56  ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) with the galactic absorption fixed at @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pks ] shows the spectra of the two images and their best fit models .",
    "we obtained an extremely hard power - law photon index , @xmath58 , considerably harder than the values obtained from most other radio - loud quasars ( @xmath59 1.51.6 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or blazars ( @xmath59 2.2 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is consistent with the previous _ rosat _  result ( @xmath60 , * ? ? ?",
    "we also estimated the absorption from the combined spectrum of the two images to compare with previous measurements .",
    "again , we fixed the galactic absorption at @xmath57  .",
    "the best fit to the combined spectrum of @xmath61  coincidentally matches the differential absorption measurement . the combined absorption and the power - law photon index obtained , @xmath62 , also agree with the analysis of the combined spectrum by @xcite .",
    "this combined absorption is somewhat lower than the estimates from molecular absorption in the radio ( @xmath63  , wiklind & combes 1996 , 1998 , gerin et al .",
    "1997 ) or the column of @xmath64  required to match combined _ rosat _  spectrum of the two images with an assumed x - ray photon index of @xmath65 ( mathur & nair 1997 ) .",
    "however , it is consistent with their measurement of @xmath66  allowing for a harder power - law photon index of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the very large absorption difference , @xmath67  , is consistent with the large differential extinction of @xmath68  mag @xcite between images b and a. combining these measurements , the dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath69 mag @xmath4 atoms@xmath5 , consistent with the standard galactic value .",

    "we did not include b  0218 + 357 , as the dust - to - gas ratio estimated by @xcite was based on very uncertain estimates ( @xmath84  @xmath85 ) of the gas column density from molecular absorption measurements in the radio @xcite .",
    "we considered only the two brightest images in each system , and for q  2237 + 0305 , where several extinction measurements are available , we used the value from @xcite to be consistent with other lenses .",
    "the values for q  2237 + 0305 are consistent with those measured by @xcite . for estimating the average dust - to - gas ratio we must exclude he  1104@xmath01805  ( see  3.2 ) . if we fit the four remaining lenses for the mean gas - to - dust ratio including the uncertainties in both the absorption and the extinction , as well as allowing for additional intrinsic scatter in the ratio beyond the measurement errors , we find a mean ratio of @xmath86 mag @xmath4 atoms@xmath5 and estimate that there is an intrinsic scatter in the ratio of @xmath87 beyond our measurement errors .",

    "these estimates are consistent with the average galactic value of @xmath89 mag @xmath4 atoms@xmath5 but show a modestly larger intrinsic scatter than the locally observed 30% @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : dtg ] compares the results for the lens galaxies to the local stellar sample from @xcite .",
    "the lens galaxies of our small sample consist of three spiral and one elliptical galaxies , although the quasar in q  2237 + 0305 is lensed by the central bulge of the spiral galaxy ( table  [ tab : dtg ] ) . considering the environmental and redshift differences , it is interesting that we obtained dust - to - gas ratios consistent with those of our galaxy .",
    "it suggests that the dust - to - gas ratio of the ism is similar in all normal galaxies .",
    "it may not , however , be universal , since @xcite found that the circumnuclear regions of local agn may have a very low dust - to - gas ratio ( a factor of @xmath123100 lower than galactic ) , possibly because of grain formation and destruction processes peculiar to the local environment created by the agn @xcite .",
    "recently , models of evolution of dust - to - gas ratios are discussed in several papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we are unable to compare the details of the models with our small sample of data .",
    "it is relatively straight forward to improve on these results by systematically obtaining resolved x - ray spectra of lenses showing significant differential extinctions . like most x - ray spectral studies ,",
    "the required integration times are fairly long ( @xmath90  ksec ) .",
    "the differential absorption measurement requires resolved spectra from individual lensed images .",
    "this means that _ xmm - newton _  can not be used despite its higher sensitivity  the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _  is required . for systems with modest differential extinctions ( @xmath91  mag )",
    "there are probably significant systematic uncertainties created by chromatic microlensing where color differences created by microlensing are misinterpreted as extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emitting region is probably not as spatially extended as the optical accretion disk , so that the entire x - ray continuum is magnified by roughly a constant at a given epoch , unless the observations occur during a high microlensing magnification event .",
    "thus , the column density estimates obtained from the absorption in the soft x - ray spectra should be insensitive to microlensing effects . focusing on lenses with significant differential extinction",
    "will also minimize the possibility that significant differences in the properties of the ism between lensed images will skew the results either because the extinction laws are very different ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or because the dust - to - gas ratios are very different . with a large enough sample , it would be possible to study the evolution of the ism with redshift .",
