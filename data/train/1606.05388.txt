    "although highly successful in terms of its phenomenological predictions , the standard model  ( sm ) of electroweak interactions seems incomplete from a theoretical view . in its present form , it is unable to predict the masses of fermions ( leptons and quarks ) , or explain why there are several families of such particles .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomena is presented by the neutrino mixing , a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation . in concordance with the recent work focus on neutrino physics  @xcite , neutrino mass scale ,",
    "corresponding dirac or majorana kind of fermion , and the source of charge - parity ( cp ) violation are unsolved questions .",
    "for that , see the experimental results concerning kamland ( kl ) reactor neutrinos  @xcite , with respect to the expectations from reference huber - mller  ( hm ) spectra  @xcite . in each of the current high - statistics short - baseline(sbl ) reactor experiments reno  @xcite , double chooz  @xcite and daya bay  @xcite .",
    "in general , if neutrinos are massive particles and their masses are non - degenerate , it is impossible to find a flavour basis in which the coincidence between flavour and mass eigenstates holds both for charged leptons and for neutrinos .",
    "hence , the phenomenon of leptonic flavour mixing is naturally appear between three charged leptons and three massive neutrinos .",
    "if there exist irremovable phase factors in the yukawa interactions , the cp violation will naturally appear both in the quark and lepton sector . in this context , the flavour and mass generation are two concepts strongly intertwined . to know the flavour dynamic in models beyond the sm , we need to understand the flavour mechanism and mass generation arising in the standard theory . in this theory ,",
    "the yukawa matrices are of great interest because the values of its elements define to the fermion masses , as well as its phases factors are related with the cp violation through the mixing matrix .",
    "moreover , the flavour changing currents arise from the not simultaneous diagonalization of higgs and yukawa matrices .",
    "particularly , we will study the flavour dynamics through yukawa matrices in the 2hdm - iii ( see therein references related with this model in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which into the processes comes with flavour violation through higgs states , that is , it allows to appear the flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by higgs fields .",
    "other models like the 2hdm - iii allow the fcnc  @xcite .",
    "the difference between these models is in the yukawa structure and symmetries of the higgs sector as well as the possible appearance of new sources of cp violation . in this work ,",
    "the higgs potential preserves the cp symmetry with the hermitian yukawa matrices .",
    "2hdm - iii predicts three neutral states and a pair of charged states : @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .    in 2hdm - iii ,",
    "fcnc are kept under control by imposing some texture of yukawa matrices that reproduce the observed fermion masses and mixing angles  @xcite . using texture forms",
    "allows for a direct relation between the yukawa matrix elements and the parameters related with the decay widths and cross section without losing the terms proportional to the light fermions masses .",
    "specifically , considering a four - zero texture yukawa matrix , one obtains in a natural way the cheng - sher ansatz for couplings flavour mix , which is widely used in the literature , where flavoured couplings are considered proportional to the involved fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "this work is realized in the frame of 2hdm - iii , considering a hybrid treatment of the neutral leptonic sector through type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "moreover , a four - zero texture ansatz for dirac and majorana neutrino mass matrices , left and right - handed neutrinos respectively .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of neutrino mixing angles using the likelihood test @xmath0 .",
    "in order to make a minimal extension of 2hdm by introducing right - handed neutrinos , we need to consider six neutrino fields ; three left - handed neutrinos @xmath3 and three right - handed neutrinos @xmath4 . where only the left - handed fields take part in the electroweak interactions . in context of two higgs doublet model plus massive neutrinos , 2hdm+3@xmath5 , for dirac leptons",

    "we consider that active neutrinos acquire their small mass through some seesaw mechanism .",
    "hence , it is possible to write out the following hybrid mass term which involves both dirac and majorana neutrinos @xmath20 in the above expression @xmath21 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are symmetric mass matrices because the corresponding mass terms are of the majorana type . in this case",
    "the lepton number @xmath24 is not conserved . in order to diagonalize the hybrid lagrangian , eq .",

    "that neutrino mass matrices satisfy the following hierarchy condition @xmath31 , we obtain that eigenvalues of @xmath32 matrix take the form : @xmath33 the previous expression is known as type-(i+ii ) seesaw mechanism , and it is just the effective mass matrix of three active neutrinos .",
    "in general , the dirac fermion mass matrix has an arbitrary shape , while the right - handed neutrino mass matrix must be symmetric , since these latter are majorana particles .",
    "in particular , in this work we consider that , respectively , the dirac fermion and right - handed neutrino mass matrices are represented with an hermitian and complex symmetric matrix with a four - zero texture shape .",

    "the mass matrices of dirac and right - handed neutrinos are represented with a four - zero texture ansatz , which implies that the mass matrix of left - handed neutrinos have also this shape with four - zero texture .",
    "in fact , all dirac fermion mass matrices are represented with the same generic hermitian matrix with four - zero texture and a normal hierarchy in the mass spectrum .",
    "theoretical expressions were derived for the elements of @xmath96 matrix in function of lepton masses , two phases @xmath130 and @xmath131 associated with the cp violation , and two parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 which are related with the yukawa matrices of 2hdm - iii . from the theoretical relations of the differences of the squared neutrino masses , and the experimental results reported by the planck collaboration and neutrino oscillation experiments , we obtain the allowed values for the neutrino masses .",
    "the parameter space exploration is done by means of likelihood test @xmath0 ; this allowed us to find the allowed regions of the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 at 70% and 95% c.l . for a normal hierarchy , as well as , the best fit point ( bfp ) , and the mixing matrix @xmath135 at 70% c.l .",
    "finally , it is observed that the mixing angle as function of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are in very good agreement with experimental data .",

    "<S> in the theoretical framework of two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) plus three right - handed neutrinos we consider a universal treatment for the mass matrices , aside from that the active neutrinos acquire their small mass through the type - i seesaw mechanism . then , as long as a matrix with four - zero texture is used to represent the right - handed neutrinos and yukawa matrices , we obtain a unified treatment where all fermion mass matrices have four - zero texture . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytical and explicit expressions for the lepton flavour mixing matrix pmns in terms of fermion masses and parameters associated with the 2hdm - iii . </S>",
    "<S> further , we compare these expressions of the pmns matrix with the most up to date values of masses and mixing in the lepton sector , via a likelihood test @xmath0 . </S>",
