    "considerable attention has been focussed on the infrared fixed point behavior  @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions , especially the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this is because there may be a stage of unification beyond the sm , and if so , it then becomes important to perform the radiative corrections in determining all the dimension @xmath0 terms in the lagrangian .",
    "this can be achieved by using the renormalization group equations to find the values of parameters at the electroweak scale , given their values at the unification scale . as such",
    ", much effort has been devoted to the study of the evolution of various dimensionless yukawa couplings in the sm , and its minimal supersymmetric extension , the mssm . using the renormalization group evolution",
    ", one can relate the yukawa couplings to the gauge couplings via the pendleton - ross infrared stable fixed point ( irsfp ) for the top - quark yukawa coupling  @xcite , or via the quasi - fixed - point behavior  @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of the sm and its supersymmetric extensions may , thus , be enhanced if the renormalization group ( rg ) running of parameters is dominated by infrared stable fixed points ( irsfps ) .",
    "these parameters ( yukawa couplings , ratios of yukawa couplings to gauge couplings , etc . )",
    "do not attain fixed point values at the weak scale , the range between the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale and the weak scale being too small for them to closely approach the fixed point .",
    "nevertheless , the couplings may be determined by the quasi - fixed point behavior  @xcite where the value of the coupling at the weak scale is independent of its value at the gut scale , provided the coupling at the gut scale is large .    in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are superpartners of the ordinary particles in the spectrum , due to which there are additional yukawa couplings  @xcite in these models which lead to baryon number @xmath1 or lepton number @xmath2 violation .",
    "often , a discrete symmetry  @xcite called @xmath3-parity @xmath4 is introduced to eliminate these @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating yukawa couplings .",
    "however , the assumption of @xmath7 conservation in mssm appears to be _ ad hoc _ , since it is not required for the internal consistency of the model .",
    "considerable attention has , thus , recently been focussed on the study of the renormalization group evolution of yukawa couplings , including the baryon and lepton number violating couplings , of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "this includes the study of quasi - fixed - point behavior as well as the true infrared fixed points of the different yukawa couplings , and the analysis of their stability .",
    "it has been shown that in the yukawa sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation there is only one infrared stable fixed point .",
    "this corresponds to nontrivial fixed point for the top- and bottom - quark yukawa couplings and the @xmath5 violating coupling @xmath8 , and a trivial one for the @xmath9-yukawa coupling and the @xmath6 violating coupling @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown that all other fixed points are either unphysical or unstable in the infrared region .",
    "similarly , fixed points were obtained for the corresponding soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings as well  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we study the renormalization group evolution in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation in order to obtain the exact as well as the approximate analytical solutions for the yukawa couplings and the soft supersymmetry breaking couplings at the weak scale given their initial values at the ultraviolet ( uv ) or the gut scale .",
    "second , we study the renormalization group flow of such a system , and determine the infrared fixed surfaces and infrared fixed points toward which the rg flow is attracted .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we describe the renormalization group equations for the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton mumber violation involving the highest generations .",
    "we obtain the exact solutions for the rg equations , and describe the infrared fixed points for the third generation yukawa couplings and the highest generation baryon and lepton number violating couplings . here",
    "we also study the corresponding rg equations for the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings , and describe their infrared fixed points .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the study of the approximate analytical solutions of the rg equations for the yukawa couplings and the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings .",
    "in sec.iv we carry out a detailed numerical study of the infrared attractive fixed surfaces , and present their two dimensional projections to demonstrate the existence of a strongly attractive fixed point . in sec.v we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall some of the basic features of the renormalization group evolution in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation , and obtain the infrared fixed points of the yukawa couplings and the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings of the model .",
    "the superpotential of the model is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the lepton and quark doublets , and anti - lepon singlet , d - type anti - quark singlet and u - type anti - quark singlet , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ mssmsuperpotential ] ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the yukawa coupling matrices , with @xmath16 as the generation indices .",
    "gauge invariance , supersymmetry and renormalizability allow the addition of the following @xmath6 and @xmath5 violating terms to the mssm superpotential ( [ mssmsuperpotential ] ) : @xmath17 respectively . in this paper",
    "we shall consider , apart from the yukawa couplings in ( [ mssmsuperpotential ] ) , the dimensionless yukawa couplings @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 only , and ignore the dimensionful couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath20 are antisymmetric in their first two indices due to @xmath23 and @xmath24 group structures , respectively .",
    "corresponding to the terms in the superpotentials ( [ mssmsuperpotential ] ) , ( [ lviolating ] ) and ( [ bviolating ] ) , there are soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear terms which can be written as @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left[{1\\over 2}(a_\\lambda)_{abc}\\lambda_{abc } \\tilde{l}^a_l \\tilde{l}^b_l \\tilde{\\overline{e}}^c_r + ( a_{\\lambda'})_{abc}\\lambda'_{abc } \\tilde{l}^a_l \\tilde{q}^b_l \\tilde{\\overline{d}}^c_r \\right]\\nonumber\\\\   & + &   \\left [ { 1\\over 2}(a_{\\lambda''})_{abc}\\lambda''_{abc } \\tilde{\\overline{d}}^a_r \\tilde{\\overline{d}}^b_r \\tilde{\\overline{u}}^c_r \\right ] ,   \\label{soft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a tilde denotes the scalar component of the chiral superfield , and the notation for the scalar component of the higgs superfield is the same as that of the corresponding superfield .",
    "in addition there are soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass terms with the masses @xmath26 with @xmath27 corresponding to the gauge groups @xmath28 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "since the third generation yukawa couplings are the dominant couplings in the superpotential ( [ mssmsuperpotential ] ) , we shall retain only the elements @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in each of the yukawa couplings matrices @xmath32 , setting all other elements equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , since there are 36 independent @xmath6 violating trilinear couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 in ( [ lviolating ] ) , and 9 independent @xmath5 violating couplings @xmath20 in the baryon number violating superpotential ( [ bviolating ] ) , we would have to consider 39 coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the @xmath6 violating case and 12 coupled nonlinear equations for the @xmath5 violating case , respectively .",
    "thus , there is a clear need for a radical simplification of the evolution equations before we can study the rg evolution of the yukawa couplings in the mssm with @xmath5 and @xmath6 violation .",
    "motivated by the generational hierarchy of the conventional higgs couplings , we shall assume that an analogous hierarchy amongst the different generations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings exists .",
    "thus , we shall retain only the couplings @xmath33 , and neglect the rest  @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings to higher generations evolve more strongly because of larger higgs couplings in their evolution equations , and hence could take larger values than the corresponding couplings to the lighter generations .",
    "we also note that the experimental upper limits are stronger for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings with lower indices  @xcite . with these assumptions",
    "we can write the relevant renormalization group equations as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the gauge couplings of @xmath36 ( in the gut normalization ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge groups , respevtively , and @xmath21 is the running mass scale .",
    "we note that within the context of grand unified theories , one is led to the situation where baryon and lepton number violating yukawa couplings may be related at the gut scale , and one may no longer be able to set one or the other arbitrarily to zero .",
    "_ we , therefore , include both , the baryon and the lepton number violating couplings , in our rg equations . _",
    "the evolution equations for the gauge couplings are not affected by the presence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings at the one - loop level , and can be written , in the usual notation , as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the corresponding one - loop renormalization group equations for the gaugino masses @xmath39 can be written as @xmath40 defining @xmath41 @xmath42 the solution of the rg equations ( [ htequation ] ) - ( [ lambdadoubleprimeequation ] ) for the yukawa and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings can be written in a closed form  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is some large initial scale , and where @xmath45 stands for the functions @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "analogous notation holds for the functions @xmath48 .",
    "the quantities @xmath49 are the diagonal elements of the wave function anamolous dimension matrix , and are given by @xmath50 and the functions @xmath48 are given by the set of integral equations    @xmath51    where the functions @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 the solutions for the rg equations ( [ gaugerge ] ) for the gauge couplings and the gaugino masses ( [ gauginorge ] ) are well known and will not be repeated here .",

    "the only nontrivial infrared fixed points are obtained by neglecting @xmath62 .",
    "then , the true infrared fixed - points for these rg equations are  @xcite @xmath63 we note that the @xmath9 yukawa coupling @xmath64 and the lepton number violating coupling @xmath3 approach trivial fixed point values since there is no contribution from the @xmath65 coupling @xmath60 in their renormalization group equations . _ also , because of this reason the @xmath5- and @xmath6- violating couplings do not approach simultaneous non - trivial fixed points .",
    "_ furthermore , the infrared fixed point values of the top- and bottom - quark yukawa couplings for the stable fixed point ( [ fstable ] ) are significantly different from the case when @xmath5 and @xmath6 is conserved  @xcite .",
    "thus , the inclusion of @xmath5 and @xmath6 violation in mssm has the effect of lowering the infrared fixed point values of the top- and bottom - quark yukawa couplings .",
    "these are the important conclusions of our analysis . from ( [ fstable ] )",
    "we note that the fixed point value for the top - quark yukawa coupling translates into a top - quark ( pole ) mass of about @xmath66 gev , which is incompatible with the measured value of  @xcite the top mass , @xmath67 gev , for any value of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the stable infrared fixed point ( [ fstable ] ) is not actually realised in nature .",
    "the infrared fixed points(irfp s ) that we have discussed above are the true irfp s of the renormalization equations for the yukawa and baryon and lepton number violating couplings .",
    "however , these fixed points may not be reached in practice , the range between the large ( gut ) scale and the weak scale being too small for the ratios to approach the fixed point values . in that case , the various yukawa couplings may be determined by quasi - fixed point behaviour  @xcite , where the values of various couplings at the weak scale are independent of their values at the large scale , provided the yukawa couplings at the large scale are large .",
    "more precisely , in the regime where the yukawa couplings @xmath69 with their ratios fixed , it is legitimate to drop @xmath70 in the denominators of the equations ( [ yukawasolution ] ) and ( [ ftequation ] )  ( [ fdoubleprimeequation ] ) so that the exact solutions for the yukawa couplings approach the infrared quasi - fixed - point ( irqfp ) defined by @xmath71 with @xmath72 we note that the result ( [ quasiyukawa ] ) follows immediately by dropping @xmath70 from the denominator of ( [ yukawasolution ] ) , whereas the results ( [ qftequation ] )  ( [ qfdoubleprimeequation ] ) follow from the corresponding equations ( [ ftequation ] )  ( [ fdoubleprimeequation ] ) by using an iterative procedure  @xcite .",
    "we stress here that both the dependence on the initial conditions for each yukawa coupling as well as the dependence on the ratios of initial values of yukawa couplings have completely dropped out of the runnings in eqs.([quasiyukawa ] ) and ( [ qftequation ] )  ( [ qfdoubleprimeequation ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the quasi - fixed - points ( [ quasiyukawa ] ) are independent of whether the @xmath5 and @xmath6 violating couplings and the third generation yukawa couplings are unified or not .",
    "the fact that the ratios of the various yukawa couplings do not enter eqs .",
