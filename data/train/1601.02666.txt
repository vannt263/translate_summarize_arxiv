    "<S> the phenomenon of many - body localised ( mbl ) systems has attracted significant interest in recent years , for its intriguing implications from a perspective of both condensed - matter and statistical physics : they are insulators even at non - zero temperature and fail to thermalise , violating expectations from quantum statistical mechanics . what is more , recent seminal experimental developments with ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices constituting analog quantum simulators have pushed many - body localised systems into the realm of physical systems that can be measured with high accuracy . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce experimentally accessible witnesses that directly probe distinct features of mbl , distinguishing it from its anderson counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we insist on building our toolbox from techniques available in the laboratory , including on - site addressing , super - lattices , and time - of - flight measurements , identifying witnesses based on fluctuations , density - density correlators , densities , and entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we build upon the theory of out of equilibrium quantum systems , in conjunction with tensor network and exact simulations , showing the effectiveness of the tools for realistic models .    </S>",
    "<S> many - body localisation provides a puzzling and exciting paradigm within quantum many - body physics and is for good reasons attracting significant attention in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> influential theoretical work @xcite building upon the seminal insights by anderson on disordered models @xcite suggested that localisation would survive the presence of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such many - body localised models , as they were dubbed , would be insulators even at non - zero temperature and exhibit no particle transport . </S>",
    "<S> maybe more strikingly from the perspective of statistical physics , these many - body localised models would fail to thermalise following out of equilibrium dynamics @xcite , challenging common expectations how systems `` form their own heat bath '' and hence tend to be locally well described by the familiar canonical gibbs ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following these fundamental observations , a `` gold rush '' of theoretical work followed , identifying a plethora of phenomenology of such many - body localised models . </S>",
    "<S> they would exhibit a distinct and peculiar logarithmic scaling of entanglement in time @xcite , the total correlations of time averages have a distinct scaling @xcite , many hamiltonian eigenstates fulfil area laws @xcite for the entanglement entropy @xcite and hence violate what is called the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis @xcite . the precise connection and interrelation between these various aspects of many - body localisation is just beginning to be understood @xcite , giving rise to a vivid discussion in theoretical physics .    </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical studies have recently been complemented by seminal experimental activity , allowing to probe models that are expected to be many - body localised in the laboratory under remarkably controlled conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work goes much beyond earlier demonstrations of anderson localisation in a number of models @xcite , in that now actual interactions are expected to be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> such ultra - cold atomic systems indeed provide a pivotal arena to probe the physics that is at stake here @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is still missing , however , is a direct detection of the rich phenomenology of many - body localisation in the laboratory . rather than seeing localisation and taking the presence of interactions for granted </S>",
    "<S> , it seems highly desirable to make use of these novel exciting possibilities to directly see the above features , distinctly separating the observations from those expected from non - interacting anderson insulators . </S>",
    "<S> such a mindset is that of `` witnessing '' a property , somewhat inspired by how properties like entanglement are witnessed @xcite in quantum information .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we aim at capturing precisely those aspects of the rich phenomenology of many - body localisation that are directly accessible with present experimental tools . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to provide a `` dictionary '' of possible tools , as a list or a classification of features that can be probed making use of only in situ site resolved measurements , including the measurement of density - density correlation and time of flight measurements , in conjunction with a variation of densities . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we aim at identifying a comprehensive list of features that `` could be held responsible '' for mbl , based on data alone . </S>",
    "<S> while all we explicitly state is directly related to cold atoms in optical lattices , a similar approach is expected to be feasible in continuous cold bosonic atoms on atom chips @xcite , where correlation functions of all orders can readily be directly measured . </S>",
    "<S> we leave this as an exciting perspective .      </S>",
    "<S> the setting we focus on is that of interacting ( spin - less ) fermions placed into a one - dimensional optical lattice , a setting that prominently allows to probe the physics under consideration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such systems are well described by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a fermionic annihilation operator on site @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the local particle number operator . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder in the model is carried by the local potential - strength @xmath4 , which is drawn independently at each lattice site @xmath2 according to a suitable probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the disorder can either be realised by superposing the lattice with an incommensurate laser or by speckle patterns @xcite . from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the disordered heisenberg chain @xcite by setting @xmath5 and scaling the disorder by a factor two . to keep the discussion conceptually clear , just as ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we make use of a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath6 $ ] , where we refer to @xmath7 as the disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath5 the ergodic to mbl phase transition is approximately at @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagramme is best known for @xmath9 corresponding to the non - interacting anderson insulator and for @xmath5 , the mbl phase . to add a flavour of usual phase transitions order parameters such as total correlations @xcite , fluctuations of local observables @xcite or the structure of the eigenstates @xcite have been suggested . while these quantites impressively signal the transition , it is not a priori clear whether they can be implemented in an actual experiment . </S>",
    "<S> recent numerical studies@xcite show that pump - probe type setups and novel instances of spin noise spectroscopy @xcite as well as utilising mbl systems as a bath @xcite are indeed suited to distinguish the above phases , albeit experimental realisations of this endeavour appear to need substantial changes and innovations in realistic setups . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility for the phase distinction , which has prominently been carried out experimentally @xcite , is given by observing the behaviour of quasi two - dimensional systems in comparison to their one dimensional counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> while this impressively demonstrates the capabilities of optical lattices as platforms for quantum simulations , it does not test the properties of mbl in one dimension as such . </S>",
    "<S> we set out to find comparably strong and direct signatures of one dimensional mbl , which however rely on simple established measurement operations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we start by summarising the measurements , which we conceive to be feasible in an optical lattice experiment .      </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to specifying what measurements we consider feasible in optical lattices with state of the art techniques . for this </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on the following two types of measurements :    * in - situ * : an in - situ measurement detects the occupation of individual lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> this technique only allows to resolve the parity of the particle number on each site , which for fermions constitutes no limitation , however . using the fact that single - shot measurements are performed , also higher moments like density - density correlators </S>",
    "<S> can be extracted from this kind of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> both ramifications will be used .    * time - of - flight * : the time - of - flight ( tof ) measurement extracts position - averaged momentum information of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the positions of the lattice sites , @xmath12 reflects the wannier functions in momentum space , and @xmath13 is a constant derived from the mass of the particles and the lattice constant .    the main goal of this work is to identify key quantities that indicate that the system indeed is many - body localised based on measurement information extracted using these two techniques . here </S>",
    "<S> , we want to show both that the system is localised and that it is interacting . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we also want to convincingly detect the difference between an mbl system and a non - interacting anderson insulator . in order to approach this task </S>",
    "<S> , we will look at the time evolution of an initial state that is particularly easy to prepare experimentally relying on optical super - lattices @xcite , namely an alternating pattern of the form @xmath14 this initial product state will , during time evolution , build up entanglement and become correlated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , this is far from being the only choice for an initial state and alterations in this pattern and correspondingly locally changing particle and hole densities would surely be insightful , specifically since a modulation of the density already points towards interactions in the mbl phase being significant . </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we put emphasis on measurements although preparation procedures as the above mentioned density variations are an interesting problem in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will demonstrate , the above defined initial state already captures the colourful phenomenology of mbl in all of its salient aspects .              </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental characteristic of mbl is the presence of local constants of motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are approximately local operators @xmath15 whose support is centered on lattice site @xmath2 , but which nevertheless commute with the hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath16=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these operators are mainly supported on a region with diameter @xmath17 , corresponding to the localisation length scale of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the mbl regime , the dynamics can be captured by a phenomenological model in terms of a set of mutually commuting quasi - local constants of motion , @xmath18 such a hamiltonian constitutes a second order approximation of what is known as the @xmath19-bit model @xcite to exemplify the dynamics . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 again denotes a quasi - local integral of motion centred on site @xmath21 , @xmath22 is a random onsite potential and the coupling strength @xmath23 between constants of motion is assumed to decay suitably fast in their distance @xmath24 . in particular , it is expected that the dynamics generated by the hamiltonian defined in eq .   in the mbl regime corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath25 can be well captured by the @xmath19-bit model .    </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological model gives rise to a separation of time scales in the evolution into two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> initially , there is a fast regime , where the evolution takes place mainly inside the support of each local constant of motion @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for this time scale , transport is unconstrained and particles and energies can move freely over the localisation length . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , information can spread ballistically . beyond the localisation length , the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by the coupling of the constants of motion , given by the second term in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intuition is that this evolution does not facilitate particle or energy propagation , leading to a complete break - down of thermal and electric conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the couplings between distant constants of motion allow for the creation of correlations over arbitrary length scales given sufficient time . </S>",
    "<S> this dephasing mechanism in turn makes it possible to send information and yields an explanatory mechanism for the observed slow growth of entanglement @xcite , measured as the von neumann entropy of the half chain of an infinite system @xmath27 ( in landau notation ) .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , these two dynamical regimes are best distinguished by the effect of a local unitary excitation on distant measurements . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , given a local measurement @xmath28 supported in a spatial region @xmath29 and a unitary @xmath30 corresponding to a local excitation in a region @xmath31 , we wish to bound the change in expectation value of @xmath32 induced by the unitary excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be cast into a lieb - robinson bound @xcite of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 a constant depending on the support of @xmath29 . for the connection between different zero velocity lieb - robinson bounds and the necessity of a linear @xmath35-dependence in * ii * , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 corresponds to the ballistic regime and @xmath37 captures the slower dephasing . in the context of optical lattices , </S>",
    "<S> local excitations seem difficult to implement . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the following , we focus on the observation of indirect effects on the dynamical evolution in mbl systems .      in the following , we demonstrate that local memory of initial conditions , slow spreading of correlations and equilibration of local densities provide clear measures to distinguish mbl systems from both the non - interacting anderson insulators and also from ergodic systems , i.e. , those where local measurements , after a short relaxation time , can be captured by thermal ensembles . in order to carry out our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we will complement the intuitive guideline provided by the phenomenological @xmath19-bit model by a numerical tensor network tebd simulation @xcite ( for details see appendix [ app : numerics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen parameters for the simulation are a disorder strength of @xmath38 and interaction strengths of @xmath5 or @xmath9 for the mbl and anderson case , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering the influence of the suppression of particle propagation .      </S>",
    "<S> a defining feature of localised systems is that independent of the interaction strength , particles and energies do not spread over the entire system , but remain confined to local regions . </S>",
    "<S> they merely redistribute inside the localisation length , which can be extracted from the constants of motion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even for long times , the particle density profile of an mbl system will not move to its thermal form , but rather retain some memory of its initial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the following particle localisation measure .    </S>",
    "<S> we define the following measure @xmath39 , which probes particle propagation for a system of length @xmath40 @xmath41    on an intuitive level , this measure directly probes the spread of particles , including weights based on the distance to the initial position @xmath42 such that distant contributions are amplified .    numerically , we find that @xmath43 initially shows a steep linear increase , indicative of the ergodic dynamics governed by the onsite term of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig ] ) . in the second regime </S>",
    "<S> it fluctuates without visible growth , indicating a break - down of particle transport on length scales beyond the localisation length . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the length scale of the phase correlations established in the system can be bounded independent of time @xmath44 . for ergodic systems , where particles and energies spread ballistically </S>",
    "<S> , the measure would grow in an unconstrained fashion over time . </S>",
    "<S> based on this insight , we deduce that time - of - flight images , while clearly distinguishing between localised and ergodic phase , are not useful for the distinction between interacting and non - interacting localised systems .    </S>",
    "<S> again more formally , this measure can be understood by considering the time evolution of the correlation matrix given by the matrix elements @xmath45 where @xmath46 . for the non - interacting case of an anderson insulator , </S>",
    "<S> this evolution is unitary @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the evolution of the fermionic mode operators . for an anderson insulator , </S>",
    "<S> dynamical localisation precisely corresponds to locality of the unitary evolution @xcite , meaning that the matrix elements of @xmath49 are expected to decay exponentially @xmath50 for some constant @xmath51 with high probability @xcite .    in the case of interacting hamiltonians that conserve the particle number </S>",
    "<S> , this time evolution can be captured in form of a quantum channel @xmath52 where the kraus operators @xmath53 depend on the full initial state . as particle propagation in an mbl system </S>",
    "<S> is expected to also be localised , it is assumed that the individual kraus operators obey @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> starting from an initial product state of the form in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath55 this again results in a suppression with the distance between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , causing a saturation of the phase correlation measure @xmath58 independent of time .      </S>",
    "<S> while particles and energies remain confined in interacting localised systems , correlations are expected to show an unbounded increase over time @xcite , although slower than in the ergodic counterpart . in stark contrast , anderson localised many - body systems will not build up any correlations that go beyond the localisation length . in order to probe the spreading of correlations in the system , we focus on a quantity easily accessible in the context of optical lattices , using in - situ images for different evolution times . as it turns out , </S>",
    "<S> this kind of simple density - density correlator is already sufficient to separate anderson localisation from mbl systems .    in order to examine the spatial spreading of density - density correlations , we define the quantity @xmath59 , @xmath60    @xmath61 is a direct indicator for the length scale over which </S>",
    "<S> density - density correlations are established without having to resort to assuming an explicit form , such as a decay in terms of an exponential function .    </S>",
    "<S> comparable to the dynamics of the phase correlations , we numerically find a steep initial increase followed by a saturation for the non - interacting case ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mbl system however , continues to build up density - density correlations for the times simulated . </S>",
    "<S> there is a transition in propagation speed , which we ascribe to the two dynamical regimes discussed before . </S>",
    "<S> hence we conclude , that density - density correlations can be used to discriminate mbl from its non - interacting counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive explanation for the spread of density - density correlations despite spatial localisation of particles is that after exploring the localisation length , the particles feel the presence of neighbouring particles . </S>",
    "<S> mediated by this interaction , the local movement of particles , governed by the respective constant of motion , becomes correlated , even over large distances . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the anderson insulator where constants of motion are completely decoupled , this communication can not take place .    </S>",
    "<S> we can connect this intuitive explanation to the more rigorous setting of lieb - robinson - bounds . in the anderson insulator in one - dimension , there provably exists a zero - velocity lieb - robinson - bound , where the correlator on the left hand side of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is bounded by a time independent factor @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the detectability of an excitation created in region @xmath29 decreases exponentially with the distance to @xmath31 . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> in the mbl regime we expect a logarithmic lieb - robinson cone of the form of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> * ii*. hence , an unbounded growth of correlations between distant regions is in principle possible , given sufficient time . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that this built - up of correlations does also happen on observable time scales as can be seen from the evolution of density - density correlations captured by * measure 2*.      it is also instructive to study the differences between the anderson and mbl - regime with respect to their equilibration properties . </S>",
    "<S> due to the interactions present , we expect equilibration of fluctuations to take place in mbl systems , whereas in anderson insulators the effective subspaces explored by single particles remain small for all times and hence fluctuations remain large </S>",
    "<S> . this in turn implies that fluctuations of local expectation values die out in the interacting model , but persist in an anderson insulator . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative difference has already been identified as a signifier of interactions in a disordered system@xcite . here , we build upon this idea and propose to consider the average change rate of local expectation values in order to detect the decreasing fluctuations in the mbl phase .    </S>",
    "<S> [ def : derivative ] we consider the expectation value @xmath63 of a local density operator in the middle of the system . as a measure of local equilibration </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the averaged rate of change of this density as a function of time @xmath64 @xmath65    as laid out in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig ] again , this function over time indeed shows a remarkably smooth behaviour that allows for the clear distinction between an anderson localised system and its mbl counterpart in that after a mutual increase the anderson system saturates at a constant value , whereas in the mbl phase , @xmath66 shrinks successively .    </S>",
    "<S> if we again resort to the lieb - robinson bound picture , we find that in the anderson case a local excitation is confined to a distinct spatial region given by the zero - velocity lieb - robinson - bound introduced in the previous chapter . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the effective subspace explored is constant and specifically , the excitation can not build up long distance correlations and fluctuations remain large . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be seen from the results of * measure 2*. if we now , however , turn to the interacting model , a local excitation will slowly explore larger and larger parts of the hilbert space , leading to a slow , but persistent decrease of the fluctuations .      in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed an operational procedure for distinguishing mbl phases building upon realistic measurements , which can be performed in the realm of optical lattices with present technology . utilising a phenomenological model and the concept of lieb - robinson - bounds </S>",
    "<S> , we explained the effects numerically investigated employing tensor network methods . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibration of local observables allows for the distinction of anderson and mbl localised models . </S>",
    "<S> density - density correlations allow for the same information bit extraction , while furthermore reproduce the expected phenomenology . further investigating </S>",
    "<S> this quantity might yield information about the localisation length via the duration of the first evolution regime .    </S>",
    "<S> phase correlations , which are directly connected to tof imaging , can not detect interactions in a localised system due to their correspondence to particle transport . </S>",
    "<S> there is yet other information the tof reveals : one can also lower bound the spatial entanglement of bosons in optical lattices @xcite , building upon the ideas of constructing quantitative entanglement witnesses @xcite , a notion of multi - partite entanglement @xmath67 detecting a deviation from a best separable approximation , as @xmath68 for all @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity detects a reasonable notion of multi - particle entanglement , which is yet different from the bi - partite entanglement discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> since this measure is only onsite local , we would expect that it can not distinguish the long - range correlations of an interacting disordered model from the dynamics inside the constant of motion . </S>",
    "<S> this further motivates the quest to engineer appropriate entanglement witnesses both accessible in optical lattice architectures as well as probing key features of mbl , a quest that is in turn expected to contribute to our understanding of mbl as such .      </S>",
