    "quantum shot noise @xcite in ballistic cavities that are either chaotic @xcite , regular @xcite or display a mixed phase space @xcite has been used as a probe of the quantum - to - classical and chaotic - to regular cross - over @xcite .",
    "the approach of the ( semi ) classical limit of ballistic quantum transport is both conceptually as well as numerically non - trivial as it represents , generically , a multi - scale problem .",
    "the two - dimensional quantum billiard ( or quantum dot , see fig .",
    "1 ) is characterized by an area @xmath0 or linear dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum wires ( or leads ) to which the billiard is attached have the width @xmath2 . in order to reach sufficiently long dwell times such that differences between transiently regular and chaotic motion become important , the relation @xmath3 should hold .",
    "to approach the semiclassical limit for the motion inside the billiard requires @xmath4 ( @xmath5 de broglie wave length ) or equivalently @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , if the ( disorder ) potential inside the dot varies over a length scale @xmath7 , we should require @xmath8 for a semiclassical approximation to hold .",
    "these conditions pertaining to the dot are necessary but not sufficient .",
    "since the scattering ( @xmath9 ) matrix maps asymptotic scattering states onto each other , also the entrance and exit channel states in the quantum wire should reach their classical limit , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the latter limit is virtually impossible to reach , neither experimentally for quantum dots @xcite or microwave billiards @xcite nor numerically @xcite .",
    "we will therefore focus in the following on the `` interior '' or `` intermediate '' semiclassical regime pertaining to the interior of the billiard , @xmath4 with convex hard - walled boundaries such that quantum diffraction in the interior can be neglected , with the understanding , however , that quantum effects due to the coupling to the asymptotic quantum wires have to be taken into account .",
    "accordingly , the term `` semiclassical approximations '' refers in the following to approximations to the constant - energy green s function for propagation in the interior of the dot @xmath12 by an approximate semiclassical limit , @xmath13 to be discussed below .",
    "the projections of @xmath14 onto asymptotic scattering states with transverse quantum numbers @xmath15 yield the amplitudes for transmission @xmath16 from the entrance ( left ) to the exit ( right ) lead and reflections @xmath17 .",
    "standard semiclassical approximations to @xmath14 face several fundamental difficulties @xcite : among many others , unitarity is violated with discrepancies in some cases as large as the conductance fluctuations the theory attempts to describe @xcite . likewise , the anti - correlation @xmath18 between transmission fluctuations , @xmath19 , and the corresponding fluctuations in the reflection , @xmath20 , as a function of the wave number @xmath21 is broken .",
    "also , the `` weak localization '' effect is considerably overestimated @xcite .",
    "these difficulties are due to the fact that hard - walled billiards possess `` sharp edges '' at the entrance and exit leads even though the interior of the dot features a smooth ( in the present case , a constant ) potential . at these sharp edges",
    "the contacts to the quantum wires feature spatial variations of the potential where the length scale @xmath7 approaches zero .",
    "consequently the semiclassical limit @xmath22 can not be reached , no matter how small @xmath5 ( or large @xmath21 ) is . in other words , the quantum properties of the leads influence also the semiclassical dynamics in the interior .",
    "this observation is the starting point for diffractive corrections such as the kirchhoff diffraction @xcite or fraunhofer diffraction @xcite .",
    "we have recently developed a pseudo - path semiclassical approximation ( psca ) @xcite with pseudo - paths that result from spawning of classical paths due to diffractive ( i.e.  non - geometric ) reflections in the lead mouths ( or point contacts ) .",
    "pseudo - paths play an essential role when incorporating indeterministic features into the semiclassical description of transport .",
    "their existence has also recently been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , although no explicit numerical investigations were performed .",
    "while classical trajectories are either ejected through the exit lead contributing to @xmath23 or return back to the entrance lead contributing to @xmath24 , a quantum wavepacket will do both .",
    "pseudo - paths interconnect otherwise disjunct subsets of classical paths that exit either through the left or right lead .",
    "the lack of this coupling is responsible for violation of the anticorrelation of transmission and reflection fluctuations , @xmath25 , in standard semiclassical approximation ( sca ) .",
    "likewise , the standard sc approximation is expected to fail for quantum shot noise @xcite that is a signature of this quantum indeterminism .",
    "for the special case of the rectangular shaped dot with lead openings placed at the midpoints , summation of exponentially proliferating pseudo - paths could be accomplished by tracing trajectories in an extended zone scheme @xcite .",
    "for arbitrarily shaped billiards and , in particular , chaotic billiards where already classical trajectories proliferate exponentially , systematic inclusion of paths and pseudo - paths up to the same length is considerably more complicated . in",
    "the following we address this problem within the framework of a semiclassical dyson equation .",
    "we present a diagrammatic expansion that allows a systematic summation of classical path and pseudo - path contributions .",
    "applications to the circular billiard ( as a prototypical regular system ) and to the bunimovich stadium billiard ( as the prototype system for chaotic scattering ) show good agreement with the numerically calculated exact quantum path length spectrum .",
    "we furthermore apply the psca to recent experimental studies of quantum scattering in microwave billiards in which pseudo - path contributions could be experimentally identified .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we briefly review the standard semiclassical approximation and previous attempts to include diffraction effects .",
    "the pseudo - path semiclassical approximation for arbitrarily convex shaped billiards will be presented in section iii employing a semiclassical version of the dyson equation .",

    "the bunimovich stadium @xcite serves as prototype system for structures with chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "before we discuss our numerical results , we point out some of the characteristic differences between the regular and chaotic structures . in the stadium billiard",
    "the number of path bundles @xcite up to a fixed length increases exponentially .",
    "the exponential proliferation represents a major challenge for the summation of paths .",
    "this leads to technical problems for the calculation of transport quantities in chaotic structures @xcite due to the limitation of the number of paths that realistically can be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the path length distribution in chaotic structures differs qualitatively from that of regular structures . for the latter",
    "we find an algebraic decay for the classical path - length distribution in contrast to the exponential decay for classically chaotic structures .",
    "this is to be distinguished from the exponential decay behavior for pseudo - paths .",
    "wirtz et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that for the rectangular billiard the sca leads to a linear ( algebraic ) decay of the path length power spectra , while the psca gives rise to an exponential decay when pseudo - paths are included .",
    "however , in chaotic systems , already classical paths proliferate exponentially as a function of the path length and can account for exponential suppression of large path lengths .",
    "therefore , the lack of pseudo - paths which also proliferate exponentially is less dramatically felt than in regular systems where the exponential proliferation of pseudo - paths competes with only linear proliferation of classical paths .",
    "this observation is key to the surprising findings in previous semiclassical calculations that the agreement between the semiclassical and the quantum pathlength spectrum is better for chaotic rather than for regular systems @xcite .",
    "however , also in chaotic systems , the effects of diffractive pseudo - paths can be clearly seen .",
    "6 shows the power spectra of transmission amplitudes for the stadium with perpendicular leads .",
    "for @xmath187 , remarkably , the path - length spectra within psca displays _ fewer _ pronounced peaks than the sca in agreement with the quantum calculation .",
    "the reason is that in a chaotic system the high density of pseudo - paths effectively causes path shadowing of true classical paths . as a result ,",
    "some of the classical peaks are drastically reduced by destructive interference even for comparatively short path length . + * c comparison with microwave experiments * + as a third application we discuss the comparison between experimental studies of geometry - specific quantum scattering in microwave billiards @xcite and semiclassical approximations ( sca and psca ) .",
    "the physics and modeling of microwave cavities are conceptually similar to that of semiconductor quantum dots due to the equivalence of the time - independent schrdinger and helmholtz equations @xcite . moreover , for microwave frequencies @xmath188 @xcite , where @xmath189 is the height of the microwave billiard , only a single transverse mode is supported by the cavity .",
    "this reduces the electromagnetic boundary conditions to dirichlet - boundary conditions allowing for an exact correspondence between electrodynamics and quantum mechanics .",
    "accordingly , the component of the electrical field perpendicular to the plane of the microwave billiard corresponds to the quantum mechanical wave function .",
    "a direct measurement of transmission and reflection amplitudes ( i.e.  electrical field amplitudes ) becomes possible .",
    "moreover the semiclassical analysis presented above is directly applicable to describe scattering in microwave billiards .",
    "fig07_n.eps    fig08_n.eps    the geometry of the microwave resonator used in the experiment @xcite is shown as inset in fig .",
    "the transmission and reflection amplitude were taken in the frequency range @xmath190 ghz @xmath191ghz , where only one mode is propagating in the waveguides .",
    "7 and 8 show the experimental and calculated data for the power spectra of the transmission and reflection amplitude , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the important role of pseudo - paths in reproducing the correct peak pattern in good agreement with experimental results can be seen in both the transmission and the reflection spectra . especially in @xmath193",
    "distinct pseudo - paths ( see insets in fig  8b ) appear which were noted in ref .",
    "for example , the peak at @xmath194 ( white arrow in fig .",
    "8a ) is caused by the trajectory with the length @xmath195 which , after one revolution in the billiard , is reflected back at the exit by the lead mouth , so that it continues for one more revolution .",
    "thus its total length @xmath196 .",
    "of course , such non - classical trajectories are not included in the standard semiclassical approximation ( fig  8a ) . in this special case ,",
    "the reflection at the open lead mouth is specular or geometric .",
    "this peak would therefore also be present in the semiclassical approximation suggested by schwieters et al .",
    "by contrast , non - geometric reflections ( `` kinks '' ) by diffractive scattering are also present , e.g.  the peak at @xmath197 ( see inset in fig .",
    "8b ) . the latter class is only contained in the psca",
    "we have presented an extension of the pseudo - path semiclassical approximation ( psca ) @xcite to billiards with arbitrary convex shape .",
    "a diagrammatic expansion of the semiclassical dyson equation for the green s function in terms of diffractive scattering diagrams is developed .",
    "the unperturbed green s function represents the sum over classical paths .",
    "each encounter with the lead ( point contact ) spawns new trajectories . by joining disjunct classical paths due to non - geometric ( diffractive ) scattering a large number of trajectories representing pseudo - paths results .",
    "the dyson integral equation can be converted to an algebraic matrix equation which can be solved by power series expansion or inversion . using the examples of a circular and a stadium billiard we have shown numerically that the path - length power spectra calculated by the psca overcome shortcomings of standard semiclassical approximations by including an exponentially proliferating number of pseudo - paths and converges towards quantum transport .",
    "moreover , we have presented a comparison between microwave billiard experiments @xcite , the sca and the psca calculation and find evidence for contributions by pseudo - paths of psca to be present in the experimental data .",
    "we expect that our pseudo - path semiclassical approximation will be able to address unresolved issues of semiclassical ballistic transport such as the problem of weak localization @xcite , the breakdown of symmetry of the autocorrelation function in reflection and transmission , and the semiclassical description of quantum shot noise . + * acknowledgements * + we thank h. schanze , u. kuhl and h .- j .",

    "the failure of the fda has more dramatic consequences for the psca than for the sca .",
    "this is due to the fact that in psca the pseudo - path coupling leads to an exponentially growing number of fdas with an increasing number of diffractive scatterings , in contrast to the linear scaling of the number of fdas involved within sca .",
    "the point to be stressed is that this failure is not due to the psca but due to the additional fda . applying more accurate diffraction integrals in this regime",
    "is expected to remedy the problem ."
