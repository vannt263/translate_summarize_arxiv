    "first , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) , we have @xmath168 the inequality holds as long as @xmath99 is large enough , while is due to @xmath169 for any finite @xmath16-continued fraction . now combining ( [ equation5 ] ) and ( [ equation6 ] ) we have    @xmath170 .    from the proof",
    "one can see that the inequlity can hold only for @xmath171 no matter how small @xmath172 is ( recall @xmath172 describes density of the terms @xmath173 in @xmath174 ) .",
    "this is the obstacle to generalize the method to cases @xmath175 .",
    "now for two points @xmath176 and @xmath177 , there is one and only one integer @xmath55 , such that    @xmath178    with    @xmath179 .    for the distance between @xmath180 and @xmath181 , similar to (",

    "theorem [ theorem2 ] follows directly from proposition [ proposition1 ] .",
    "comparing our proposition [ proposition1 ] with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , we can see that for @xmath183 and a sequence @xmath5 with @xmath44 , the dimension of the set @xmath184 can still vary in a large scope ( at least between @xmath185 and @xmath7 ) . in this case , in order to get a full dimensional set ( or say , an @xmath63-dimensional set , @xmath186 ) @xmath81 , not only order of @xmath6 matters , but also many other aspects . for example , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) , differences of the two neighbouring terms @xmath187 ( the term @xmath188 there in fact sets restrictions on @xmath187 ) play an importance role .",
    "also , density of some `` special '' terms matters sometimes , as one can see from our examples in proposition [ proposition1 ] , there @xmath189 describes density of the critical terms @xmath190 . however , general conditions on these aspects for getting a full dimensional set are difficult for us to describe .",
    "so we think the upper bounds @xmath192 on @xmath193 in theorem [ theorem3 ] should be able to be decreased .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that the bounds can be decreased from @xmath192 to @xmath194 in theorem [ theorem3 ] .",
    "at last we would like to talk more about one of the techniques used in the proof of theorem [ theorem3 ] , that is , using bounds on the dimension of sets regarding individual quotients to bound dimension of sets regarding sums of the quotients .",
    "we can use the idea to do more in fact .",
    "since the dimensional theory of sets in continued fractions are developed , people have considered distributions of various terms , say , @xmath195 ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath196 ( see @xcite @xcite ) , etc . , or hybrids of them ( for example",
