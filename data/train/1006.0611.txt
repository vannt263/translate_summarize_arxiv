    "for cyclic machines with _ finite cycle time _ , the _ efficiency at maximum power output _",
    "@xcite is a suitable indicator of its performance @xcite . for molecular motors ,",
    "the _ stokes efficiency _",
    "@xcite is an alternative measure of performance .",
    "however , not all machines are designed for the sole purpose of performing mechanical work . in this paper",
    "we consider a class of machines whose main function is to synthesize a hetero - polymer , subunit by subunit , using another hetero - polymer as the corresponding template .",
    "the conceptual framework that we develop here is generally applicable to all machines which drive template - dictated polymerization .",
    "but , for the sake of concreteness , we formulate the theory here for a specific machine , namely , the ribosome @xcite ; it polymerizes a protein using a messenger rna ( mrna ) as the corresponding template and the process is referred to as _ translation _ ( of genetic message ) .",
    "the subunits of a mrna are nucleotides , whereas those of a protein are amino acids .",
    "the correct sequence of amino acids to be selected by the ribosome is dictated by the corresponding sequence of the codons ( triplets of nucleotides ) .",
    "the ribosome also uses the mrna template as the track for its movement . in each step , the ribosome moves forward by one codon on its track , and the protein gets elongated by one amino acid .",
    "ribosome has a quality control system to minimize translational error by rejecting incorrect incoming amino acid subunits .    for a ribosome ,",
    "the average speed @xmath0 of polymerization of a protein and the fidelity @xmath1 of translation , rather than efficiency and power output , are the primary indicators of its performance .",
    "we define these quantities , as well as a few others , quantitatively and calculate these analytically .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , we show that a higher rate of elongation of the protein does not necessarily sacrifice the translational fidelity .",
    "a ribosome consists of two interconnected parts called the large and the small subunits .",
    "the small subunit binds with the mrna track and decodes the genetic message of the codon , whereas the polymerization of the protein takes place in the large subunit .",
    "the operations of the two subunits are coordinated by a class of adapter molecules , called transfer rna ( trna ) .",
    "one end of a trna helps in the decoding process by matching its anti - codon with the codon on the mrna , while its other end carries an amino acid subunit ; in this form the complex is called an amino - acyl trna ( aa - trna ) .",
    "the three main steps of each cycle of a ribosome are as follows : ( i ) selection of the cognate aa - trna , ( ii ) formation of the peptide bond between the amino acid brought in by the selected aa - trna and the elongating protein , and ( iii ) translocation of the ribosome by one codon . however , some of these steps consist of important sub - steps . moreover , the branching of paths from a well defined mechano - chemical state can give rise to the possibility of more than one cyclic pathway for a ribosome in a given cycle .",
    "neither of these features was captured by the earlier models @xcite .",
    "the complete set of states and the pathways for a single ribosome in _ our model _ are shown in fig.[fig - ribomodel ] .",
    "this model may be regarded as an extension of the fisher - kolomeisky generic model for molecular motors @xcite .",
    "the selection of aa - trna actually consists of two sub - steps . in the first sub - step , among the trnas , which arrive at the rate @xmath2 , non - cognate ones are rejected , at the rate @xmath3 , because of codon - anticodon mismatch .",
    "the second sub - step implements a kinetic proofreading mechanism for screening out the near - cognate trnas ; this sub - step is irreversible and involves hydrolysis of a guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) molecule ( at the rate @xmath4 ) .",
    "near - cognate trnas are rejected at the rate @xmath5 .",
    "but , if the trna is cognate , the protein gets elongated by the addition of the corresponding amino acid ( at the rate @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , occasionally a near - cognate trna escapes potential rejection and the ribosome erroneously incorporates it into the protein ( at a rate @xmath7 ) .",
    "the subsequent translocation step actually consists of important sub - steps .",
    "the first sub - step is a _",
    "reversible _ relative ( brownian ) rotation of the two subunits with respect to each other ( with rates @xmath8 and @xmath9 along the correct path and with rates @xmath10 and @xmath11 along the wrong path ) . in the state labeled by @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 ) , the trnas are in the so - called `` hybrid '' configuration @xcite , the details of which are not required for our purpose here . the second sub - step , which is _ irreversible _ , is driven by the hydrolysis of a gtp molecule ; this sub - step leads to the coordinated movement of the trnas within the ribosome and the forward stepping of the ribosome by one codon on its mrna track ( at the rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 along the correct and wrong paths , respectively ) .",
    "further detailed identification of the states labeled in fig.[fig - ribomodel ] by the integers @xcite is not needed for our purpose here .",
    "thus , following the selection of a cognate aa - trna , the correct pathway is @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , if a non - cognate aa - trna is picked up , the most probable pathway is @xmath17 .",
    "however , if the aa - trna is near cognate , then the pathway could be either @xmath18 ( successful kinetic proofreading ) or @xmath19 ( incorporation of a wrong amino acid ) .    in principle",
    ", the model does not necessarily require any relation among the rate constants .",
    "however , throughout this paper we assume that @xmath20 a constant , because the more stringent the proofreading is , the fewer will be the wrong proteins produced .",
    "we define the fraction @xmath21 as a measure of translational _",
    "fidelity_. the _ error ratio _ @xmath22 , is the fraction of wrong amino acids incorporated in a protein .",
    "we also define the _ rejection factor _ as @xmath23 note that the average velocity @xmath0 of a ribosome is also identical to the average rate of elongation of the protein that it polymerizes . a higher @xmath0 results in a larger `` quantity '' of the protein after a given interval . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter @xmath1 characterizes the `` quality '' of the final product while @xmath24 characterizes the `` effort '' of the quality control system in screening out the non - cognate trna ( including near - cognate trna ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath25 is the probability of finding the ribosome in the `` chemical '' state @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , irrespective of its position on the mrna track .",
    "the obvious normalization condition is @xmath28 . solving the master equations for @xmath25 in the steady - state",
    ", we get the average velocity @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the length of a codon and @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the special case @xmath32 , different terms of @xmath33 are the average time spent by the ribosome in different mechano - chemical states .",
    "\\(a ) +   + ( b ) +   + ( c ) +   +     +     and stokes efficiency @xmath34 are plotted against the fidelity @xmath1 . ]",
    "the direct transition @xmath35 gives rise to `` slippage '' @xcite .",
    "therefore , the coupling between the chemical input and the mechanical output is `` loose '' @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the mechanical flux to chemical flux @xcite can be taken as a measure of the strength of the mechano - chemical coupling @xmath36 : @xmath37 so that @xmath38 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "similar quantitative measures of mechano - chemical coupling have been introduced earlier @xcite in the general context of motors which can execute `` futile '' cycles of hydrolysis of nucleotide tri - phosphates ( including gtp ) . in the steady state of our model , @xmath40    the input power consumed in proofreading is @xmath41\\delta\\mu \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the input power consumed in protein synthesis @xmath42\\delta\\mu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the free energy released by the hydrolysis of a single gtp molecule .",
    "thus , the total power input is @xmath44    we define the thermodynamic efficiency @xmath45 and the stokes efficiency @xmath34 by the relations @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the load force and @xmath48 is the phenomenological form of the viscous drag on the ribosome .",
    "one of the limitations @xcite of definitions ( [ eq - defeta ] ) is that it implies vanishing thermodynamic efficiency as the external load force vanishes although , in reality , the motor continues to work against the viscous drag .",
    "@xmath49 is the appropriate measure of the efficiency of a molecular motor when @xmath47 vanishes . from definitions ( [ eq - defeta ] )",
    "@xmath50 , and using expression ( [ eq - v ] ) for @xmath0 , we get @xmath51 moreover , we assume the standard form @xcite of @xmath47-dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 : the values of these rate constants in the absence of @xmath47 are multiplied by the factor @xmath54 where @xmath55 . for plotting the graphs ,",
    "we have used the parameter values @xmath56pn , @xmath57 , @xmath58 nm , @xmath59 , @xmath60s@xmath61 , @xmath62s@xmath61 , @xmath63s@xmath61 , @xmath64s@xmath61 , @xmath65s@xmath61 , and @xmath66pn.s.m@xmath61 .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 have been varied over a wide range always keeping @xmath67s@xmath61 .",
    "the average rate @xmath0 of elongation of a protein is plotted against the rejection factor @xmath24 and fidelity @xmath1 in figs.[fig - vvsrphi](a ) and ( b ) , respectively ( note the unit used for plotting @xmath0 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath5 increases the rejection factor @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , naively , one would expect @xmath0 to decrease with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "however , because of constraint ( [ eq - constraint ] ) , the increase in @xmath5 is compensated by decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , instead of decreasing , @xmath0 can increase with @xmath24 provided @xmath6 is sufficiently large ( see fig.[fig - vvsrphi](a ) ) .",
    "moreover , contrary to naive expectation , @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath1 as long as @xmath5 is kept fixed ( see fig.[fig - vvsrphi](b ) ) .",
    "however , for a given @xmath1 , @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath5 ; this decrease is caused by the increasing frequency of the futile cycles in which a molecule of gtp is hydrolyzed in kinetic proofreading and the aa - trna is rejected . in order to emphasize the interplay of @xmath24 and @xmath1 directly , in fig.[fig - vvsrphi](c ) , we plot @xmath0 against @xmath24 for several different values of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , for a given @xmath1 , @xmath0 decreases monotonically with @xmath24 .",
    "similar monotonic decrease in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath5 demonstrates that the `` slippage '' caused by the kinetic proofreading weakens the mechano - chemical coupling @xmath36 ( see fig.[fig - kvswr ] ) .",
    "the variation of the efficiencies @xmath45 and @xmath34 with @xmath1 is shown in the three - dimensional plot of fig.[fig - petes ] .",
    "taking cross sections of this diagram parallel to the @xmath68 plane for several different constant values of @xmath1 ( not shown in any figure ) we find that @xmath45 increases monotonically with @xmath34 , but the increase is sublinear .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that although @xmath1 depends only on the ratio @xmath69 , @xmath0 depends separately also on @xmath70 through its dependence on @xmath71 .",
    "intracellular machines which carry out template - dictated polymerization of macromolecules can be regarded as molecular motors @xcite . obviously ,",
    "as we have shown here , appropriate measures of efficiency can be defined and calculated for such motors .",
    "however , the performance of these machines is evaluated better in terms of _ fidelity _ and rate of polymerization , rather than efficiency and power output . using our theoretical model for the kinetics of translation ,",
    "we show that , contrary to the widespread belief , a higher rate of polymerization of a protein does not necessarily compromise the translational fidelity .",
    "we have also analyzed the interplay of the `` futile cycles '' arising from kinetic proofreading and the consequent `` looseness '' of the mechano - chemical coupling .    for carrying out the calculations",
    "analytically , we ignored the possible variations of the rate constants from one codon to another .",
    "therefore , our prediction can be tested _ in - vitro _ using an artificially synthesized sequence - homogeneous mrna ( i.e. , mrna strand whose codons are all identical , except for the start and stop codons ) . in the surrounding medium",
    "only two species of amino acid subunits should be available , one of these two species is cognate whereas the other is not .",
    "the rate constants @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath15 can be varied by replacing the non - cognate amino acid subunits with another distinct species which is also non - cognate .    the performance of all the intracellular machines of template - dictated polymerization can be characterized and evaluated within the general conceptual framework developed here .",
    "however , the results for polymerases @xcite , which polymerize dna and rna , would differ from those of ribosomes because of the differences between their respective mechano - chemical cycles .",
