    "the  mission @xcite was designed mainly to rapidly detect , locate , and observe gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( grbs ) . after more than two years of operation",
    ", the  satellite has observed approximately 180 grbs , for which more than 50 events have known redshifts reported in the mission homepage . in this paper we present results from an _ homogeneous _ spectral analysis that we have carried out to the  long  duration grbs with known @xmath1 with the main aim of estimating the time  averaged spectral parameters of the prompt emission of these bursts , as well as related global quantities like the prompt energy fluence , , and the rest  frame isotropic ",
    "equivalent radiated energy , .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral coverage of the  @xmath2ray detector , the burst alert telescope ( bat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is very narrow .",
    "the recommendation is to limit the spectral analysis to channels between 15 kev and 195 kev , though the bat s team suggests a more conservative upper limit of 150 kev because , above this energy , the calibration is not yet sufficiently reliable .",
    "thus , the bat energy range is not broad enough to allow the spectra to be fitted unambiguously by the usual grb broken power  law function of 4 parameters .",
    "therefore , the inference of @xmath2ray spectral parameters and global quantities related to these parameters for the  grbs is not an easy task .",
    "a main concern of this task is the determination of the uncertainties of the spectral parameters and their propagation into the composite quantities . due to the narrow energy range of  bat we know _ a priori _ that the errors in the fitted spectral parameters will be large and correlated among them .",
    "therefore , the appropriate handling of errors is crucial in order to make useful the spectral data generated by bat .",
    "the effort is justified by the great value that an _ homogeneous _ sample has , where the spectral information for all the events is obtained with the same detector and analyzed with the same techniques and methods .",
    "this is the case of the growing  in  number sample of  grbs .",
    "the characterization of the time  averaged photon spectra of grbs with known redshift is important for several reasons . on one hand",
    ", this characterization offers clues for understanding the radiation and particle acceleration mechanisms at work during the prompt phase of the bursts ( see for recent reviews e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the spectral parameters and the global quantities inferred from them ( , , etc .",
    ") are among the main properties that characterize grbs .",
    "the study of the rest ",
    "frame correlations among these and other properties ( e.g , .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is currently allowing to learn key aspects of the nature of grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , those correlations that are tight enough can be used to standardize the energetics of grbs , making possible to apply grbs for constructing the hubble diagram up to unprecedentedly high redshifts ( ghirlanda et al .",

    "these tight correlations , for a given cosmological model , can be used also to estimate the ( pseudo)redshifts of grbs with not measured redshifts , mainly from the extensive _",
    "cgro_batse database ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , by combining the distribution in redshift of a large sample of grbs with the observed flux distribution , inferences on the luminosity function and formation rate of grbs can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 we explain the main steps of the spectral analysis carried out by us : selection of the sample (   2.1 ) , spectral deconvolution ( fit ) procedure and fitting models (   2.2 ) , and error analysis (   2.3 ) .",
    "the results of the spectral analysis are given in  3 , along with the estimates of   and   as well as some correlations among the obtained quantities .",
    "the summary and conclusions of the paper are presented in  4 . in the appendix the deconvolved spectra of the 47 grbs studied here",
    "are plotted .",
    "we adopt the concordance @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 km s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "the first step in our spectral analysis is the selection of the   sub - sample of grbs to be studied (   2.1 ) .",
    "then we proceed to the spectral deconvolution with xspec and determination of the grb spectral parameters for two and three  parameter photon models (   2.2 ) . by using these parameters ,",
    "the energy fluence and isotropic  equivalent energy are calculated .",

    "the effective efficiency of bat starts at approximately 15 kev , attains a broad maximum at approximately 30100 kev and then falls off , attaining at 195 kev the same level as at 15 kev . due to the 1 mm thickness of the lead tiles ,",

    "for example the elimination of the late wing may harden artificially the spectrum .",
    "for these reasons we have fixed the integration time by a visual inspection of the light curve as the period where the signal is clearly identifiable in the background noise . a modest overestimate of   does not influence on the values of the integrated parameters , though increases the noise .",

    "this correlation , however , has no physical meaning , since it is the result of the attempt of the single power law to account for the data point above the peak , with smaller flux ( in ) . as  decreases , a larger fraction of data lies above the peak , inducing the single power law to steepen .",

    "this heterogeneity in the data should introduce a spurious scatter . in spite that the data used here have large observational errors , the dispersion of our fit lies within the range of fits reported previously .",
    "this is namely due to the homogeneity of the sample and because , having taken into account the whole error ellipses associated to the data points , it results that the major  axis orientation of most of these ellipses is close to the direction of the correlation line .",

    "@xmath89 the spectra of the remaining 18 bursts ( classes c+d ) are well fitted by the simple pl model . for 11 bursts ( class c ) of the 47 grbs , the best pl ",
    "fit value of the photon index   is greater than @xmath18 , suggesting that @xmath20 kev .",
    "the other 7 bursts ( class d ) show a photon index   lower than @xmath18 which implies a decreasing power ",
    "law spectrum in the analysed energy range . in these cases ,",
    "the peak energy could lie in the x  ray range .",
    "@xmath89 the fluence , , and rest  frame isotropic equivalent energy , , as well as their uncertainties , were calculated for the 29 ( classes a+b ) grbs with reliable fits to the cpl model .",
    "this is currently the largest _ homogeneous _ sample of long grbs with determined spectral parameters and .",
    "the mean values of the rest peak energy  and  in the sample are @xmath90 kev and @xmath91 erg , respectively .",
    "@xmath89 the  as inferred from the cpl fit and @xmath67 as inferred from the pl fit do correlate . however , this correlation is not physical , but is the result of the attempt of the single pl to account for the data points above the peak , with smaller flux . as  decreases , a larger fraction of data lies above the peak , inducing the single power law to steepen .",
    "therefore , the correlation _ should not _ be used to infer  when knowing only @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , we show that   and @xmath66 do not correlate .",
    "@xmath89 a correlation between  and  ( the amati relation ) is confirmed for our sample [ eq . ( [ corr ] ) ] .",
    "this correlation and its scatter are consistent with the ones established previously for non  bursts , showing that the   correlation is hardly an artifact of selection effects .",
    "the zero  point of our correlation ( in log ",
    "log ) is larger by @xmath92 dex at the sample median value of  than the latest updated `` amati '' correlation @xcite .",
    "this difference is expected due to the use of a cpl model for describing the observed spectra instead of the band model .",
    "@xmath89 when the band model with the high  energy photon index frozen to @xmath93 is fitted to the spectra of our 29 ( classes a+b ) grbs , the zero  point of the resultant ",
    "correlation becomes smaller than in the case of the cpl model .",
    "for the band model , the obtained ",
    "correlation is given by eq .",
    "( [ corr_band ] ) , which is virtually indistinct from the amati correlation established previously for uneven observable data - sets from different satellites .",
    "although in this work we were able to process homogeneously the spectra of a significant fraction of the   grbs with known redshift , the sample is still limited for conclusive results regarding the physical meaning of the correlations among the burst observable properties . during the refereeing process of this work , appeared a paper by @xcite , where the author finds evidence of significant change in the amati correlation parameters with redshift for the heterogeneous sample of 48 grbs compiled by @xcite .",
    "the number of grbs with known redshifts and full spectral information obtained homogeneously should increase in order to attain more conclusive results .",
