    "most astrophysical fluids , including stellar winds and the interstellar medium ( ism ) , are turbulent @xcite with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of their properties .",
    "high interstellar reynolds numbers ( @xmath1 ; l = the characteristic scale or driving scale of the system , @xmath2=the velocity difference over this scale , and @xmath3=viscosity ) ensure that .",
    "turbulence spans from km to kpc scales and holds the key to many astrophysical processes ( e.g. , star formation , fragmentation of molecular clouds , heat and cosmic ray transport , magnetic reconnection ) . statistics of turbulence is also essential for the cmb foreground studies @xcite .",
    "kolmogorov scalings @xcite were the first major advance in the theory of incompressible ( non - magnetized ) turbulence .",
    "kolmogorov theory predicts an isotropic power law energy spectrum ( @xmath4 ) in wave - vector space @xmath5 .",
    "attempts to describe magnetic incompressible turbulence statistics were made by iroshnikov @xcite and kraichnan @xcite .",
    "their model of turbulence ( ik theory ) is isotropic in spite of the presence of the magnetic field and predicts @xmath6 power law energy spectra for both velocity and magnetic field .",
    "however , the assumption of isotropic energy distribution in wave - vector space has been criticized by many researchers @xcite .",
    "an ingenious model very similar in its beauty and simplicity to the kolmogorov model has been proposed by goldreich & sridhar @xcite ( hereinafter gs95 ) for incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "it predicts a kolmogorov - like energy spectra ( @xmath7 ) in terms of wave - vector component @xmath8 which is perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field .",
    "the parallel component of the wave - vector @xmath9 within the model .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite support the gs95 model .    in this paper",
    ", we study compressible supersonic sub - alfvnic mhd turbulence in low-@xmath0 plasmas .",
    "while the gs95 model describes incompressible mhd turbulence well , no accepted theory exists for compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "earlier theoretical and numerical efforts @xcite addressed effects of compressibility for limited parameter spaces . in ( isothermal ) plasmas , there are 3 types of mhd waves - alfvn , slow , and fast waves .",
    "alfvn modes are incompressible while slow and fast modes are compressible .",
    "lithwick & goldreich @xcite conjectured that alfvn modes follow the gs95 model and slow modes passively follow the same scalings for high @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11=gas pressure , @xmath12=magnetic pressure ; @xmath13=sound speed ; @xmath14=alfvn speed ) regime , which is largely similar to the exactly incompressible regime .",
    "they also mentioned that this relation can carry on for low @xmath0 plasmas .    in the ism @xmath0",
    "is frequently less than unity .",
    "for instance , it is @xmath15 or less for molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , we consider low @xmath0 regime in this paper .",
    "interstellar turbulence is traditionally thought to be sub - alfvnic ( @xmath16 ) , although this is not a universally accepted assumption ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if turbulence is super - alfvnic initially , we expect that eventually magnetic energy should approach the equipartition level @xcite and the scales smaller than the energy injection scale should fall in the sub - alfvnic compressible regime .",
    "arguments in gs95 are suggestive that the coupling of alfvn to fast and slow modes will be weak .",
    "consequently , we expect that in this regime the alfvn cascade should follow the gs95 scaling .",
    "moreover the slow modes are likely to evolve passively ( see @xcite ) , so that we expect the gs95 scaling for them as well . however , fast modes are expected to show isotropic distribution as their velocity does not depend on magnetic field direction . to test those theoretical conjectures we use numerical simulations .",
    "to mitigate spurious oscillations near shocks , we combine two essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) schemes . when variables are sufficiently smooth , we use the 3rd - order weighted eno scheme @xcite without characteristic mode decomposition .",
    "when opposite is true , we use the 3rd - order convex eno scheme @xcite .",
    "we use a three - stage runge - kutta method for time integration .",
    "we solve the ideal mhd equations in a periodic box : @xmath17 with @xmath18 and an isothermal equation of state . here",
    "@xmath19 is a random large - scale driving force , @xmath20 is density , @xmath21 is the velocity , and @xmath22 is magnetic field .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath2 is maintained to be approximately unity , so that @xmath21 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity of the system and @xmath23 as the alfvn speed in the same units .",
    "the time @xmath24 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath25 ) and the length in units of @xmath26 , the scale of the energy injection .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath27 .    for mode coupling studies ( fig .",
    "[ fig_coupling ] ) , we use @xmath28 grid points and we do _ not _ drive turbulence .",

    "@xmath30 is the average density . for scaling studies ( fig .",
    "[ fig_scaling ] ) , we drive turbulence solenoidally in fourier space and use @xmath31 points , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the average rms velocity in statistically stationary state is @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the scaling results reported here utilize @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
