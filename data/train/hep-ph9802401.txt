    "rare decays of heavy quarks which do not occur at the tree level in the standard model ( sm ) can provide a unique opportunity for new physics to reveal itself .",
    "when such decays occur through loops then the participating sm particles and those associated with the new interaction are placed on the same footing and may yield comparable contributions to the various decay amplitudes . in these cases",
    "it may be possible to isolate such additional contributions and learn something about the detailed nature of the new physics scenario .    amongst the rare decays involving @xmath6 quarks , two of the cleanest and most well understood inclusive processes are @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "at present , the branching fraction for the @xmath0 mode has been measured by cleo@xcite to be @xmath8 while a preliminary result from aleph@xcite yields the value @xmath9 . on the other hand , there exist only upper bounds for the decay @xmath1 ; the strongest constraint at present is the @xmath10 cl limit @xmath11@xcite from cleo , which is obtained by combining both their di - electron and di - muon data samples . as we will see below , this is only a factor of @xmath12 above the expectations of the sm for this branching fraction so that we may expect this decay to be observed in the near future .    in the sm and in many of its extensions",
    "( including , , fourth generation models , models with an extra down - type quark , susy , extended higgs sectors , @xmath13 scenarios , theories with large anomalous gauge boson couplings , . ) the phenomenology of both of these rare processes above are almost completely determined by the numerical values of the wilson coefficients of only a small set of operators evaluated at the scale @xmath14 . in our somewhat unconventional notation",
    "these are denoted as @xmath15 . at the weak scale",
    "the operators corresponding to these coefficients arise in the sm from the usual @xmath16 and @xmath17 penguins as well as @xmath18 box diagrams .",
    "it has been successfully argued in the literature@xcite that by combining observables associated with both the @xmath7 and @xmath1 processes , a model independent three dimensional global fit can be performed to numerically determine the values of these three wilson coefficients .",
    "indeed , given sufficient statistics at future @xmath3-factories this approach leads to only rather modest uncertainties in the fitted values of these coefficients allowing us to test the sm and look for new physics .",
    "we note that only the magnitude @xmath19 can be extracted from the @xmath0 transition so that its sign would remain undetermined from this channel alone even if infinite precision were available . for the observables associated with the @xmath1 decay all three of the coefficients contribute and therefore their relative signs as well as their magnitudes can be extracted from the data when combined with our knowledge of @xmath20 .    in some ways",
    "the determination of the these three wilson coefficients via a global fitting procedure in rare @xmath3 decays is similar to the searches for new physics in precision electroweak measurements@xcite through the use of the oblique parameters @xmath21@xcite .",
    "as the reader may recall , in the sm ( for a reference value of the top quark and higgs boson masses ) these parameters are all identically zero . for certain classes of new physics , such as a fourth generation of quarks and leptons , fits to precision data",
    "would then lead to some consistent set of non - zero values for these parameters with a good @xmath22 .",
    "of course , if these parameters are found to be non - zero and it is also found that different precision observables yielded statistically distinct @xmath21 values then we would necessarily conclude that the new interactions are not describable by the oblique corrections alone .",
    "( as is well known , any class of new interactions that induce significant flavor dependent vertex corrections , such as a @xmath13 , can not be portrayed solely in terms of @xmath21 . )",
    "such a situation would provide a unique window on the complex nature of the new physics scenario .",
    "it is then obvious that when sufficient statistics become available in the not too distant future for this type of analysis of rare @xmath3 decays to be performed , there are only three possible outcomes : ( @xmath23 ) the numerical values for the coefficients are found to agree with the sm expectations with a good @xmath22 . in this case the new physics is decoupled and either higher precision data or searches elsewhere are necessary to uncover it .",
    "( @xmath24 ) a quality fit is obtained but the values one finds for the three wilson coefficients are far from the sm expectations in @xmath22 .",
    "this is the result usually discussed and anticipated in the literature@xcite in the set of extended models listed above .",
    "( @xmath25 ) as with the case of precision measurements , the last possibility is potentially the most interesting and the one we are interested in here : the value of @xmath22 for the best three parameter fit is found to be very large and can not be accounted for by an under estimation of systematic uncertainties .",
    "this represents in some sense a failure of the model independent approach in that it is clear that the true numerical values of the three wilson coefficients are not being extracted from the data .",
    "however , another point of view is that this result is in fact this approach s greatest triumph since it is telling us that the new interactions necessarily involve an extension of the operator basis to include _ new _ operators beyond the usual set .",
    "this implies that the new physics scenario is richer than any of those in the list above .",
    "thus the question we wish to address here is whether new physics which does involve new operators in an extended basis can indeed manifest itself as a poor fit when we have the freedom to vary the 3 coefficients to obtain a good @xmath22 .",
    "( of course , @xmath19 can not be freely varied by too large an amount due to the reasonable agreement between the present data and sm expectations for the @xmath0 decay rate as discussed below . )",
    "the purpose of this paper is then to demonstrate this result by providing an existence proof that a new physics scenario of the desired type not only exists , in the form of the left - right symmetric model ( lrm ) , but that it leads to poor values of @xmath22 in the global fit when only the usual three operators are employed .",
    "the point we wish to stress here is not the particular physics of the lrm , or any other specific model , but that the existence of an extended operator basis can indeed manifest itself in the poorness of the three parameter fit given reasonable integrated luminosities .",
    "we note , however , that without further analysis the failure of the fit itself will not yield information on which new operators would need to be introduced .",
    "we further note that the lrm is of course not the only new physics scenario with an extended operator basis@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we overview the status of the various pieces necessary for calculations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay rates and distributions in the sm . in section 3",
    "we provide a background on the basics of the lrm and the parameters it contains which are relevant for the processes of interest here .",
    "we discuss and generate several possible forms of the right - handed ckm weak mixing matrix , @xmath26 , following a systematic approach that maintains unitarity and wherein agreement with experimental constraints can be easily accommodated .",
    "next we set up the lrm calculations for these decays and demonstrate that many lrm parameter space regions exist wherein the rate for @xmath0 is essentially the same as in the sm . the general formulae for the @xmath1 double differential distributions are discussed and it is shown that the lrm yields distinct results for observables associated with this decay even when the @xmath0 rate duplicates the sm expectation . in section 4",
    "we discuss our monte carlo approach and generate a large number of data samples corresponding to each of the several models discussed in the previous section .",
    "we demonstrate that for high luminosities , corresponding to @xmath27 @xmath28 pairs , typical of samples available at hadron colliders , the resulting fits to the conventional three wilson coefficients lead to very large @xmath22 values which clearly signal the failure of the fit . for lower luminosities , now corresponding to @xmath29 @xmath28 pairs , typical of samples to be available at @xmath30(4s ) machines ,",
    "the @xmath22 values are also found to be quite large in most , but not all , cases .",
    "a discussion of these results and our conclusions can be found in section 5 .",
    "in order to be convinced that new physics has indeed been discovered it is necessary that the predictions for the rates and other observables associated with these decays in the sm be on firm ground . in particular , calculations of the decay rates and , in the case of @xmath1 , kinematic distributions have become increasingly sophisticated within the sm context .",
    "a `` straightforward '' next - to - leading order(nlo ) calculation finds @xmath31@xcite .",
    "however the inclusion of @xmath32 and @xmath33 corrections@xcite increases this value by about @xmath34 .",
    "a further enhancement of about @xmath34 occurs when one systematically disregards any of the nnlo terms@xcite . while closer to the central value of the preliminary aleph measurement these predictions are certainly consistent with the present cleo data . for purposes of simplicity , in our numerical analysis below",
    "we make direct use the nlo result and ignore these additional small correction terms .",
    "this approximation will have no impact on our conclusions .",
    "one may anticipate that in the next few years this theoretical uncertainty may shrink to as low as @xmath35 as the various input parameters are better determined . a comparable experimental determination of this branching fraction may also be possible at future @xmath3-factories since the measurements will be limited only by systematics .",
    "we will _ assume _ below that the sm value for this branching fraction is essentially realized by future experiments within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .    in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "a complete short - distance nlo calculation has been available for some time@xcite and the @xmath32 correction terms are also known@xcite but provide only very small modifications .",
    "one of the remaining difficulties is the inclusion of non - perturbative long distance pieces associated with the @xmath36 and @xmath37 resonances and the corresponding @xmath33 corrections . here",
    "some modeling uncertainties remain and the traditional approach has been to treat the resonance contributions phenomenologically , which is not without some difficulties@xcite . however , at least in the regions sufficiently below and above the resonances ( , @xmath38 or @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair ) buchalla , isidori and rey@xcite have shown that the heavy quark expansion in terms of @xmath33 leads to reliable predictions with only small corrections to the nlo results and that there are no difficulties associated with double counting . in the same kinematic regions the phenomenological resonance models give comparable numerical predictions . in many extensions to the sm , the @xmath41 and resonant contributions",
    "are either of the same form as in the sm or can be easily obtained via suitable modifications of the sm terms and we employ these results in our analysis below .",
    "we note that the sm predicts a branching fraction for @xmath42 of @xmath43 , which is not too far from the present upper bound .    in order to obtain the complete parton level nlo predictions for these two processes in the sm ( or in other models ) , several steps are necessary .",
    "first , the complete operator basis must be determined at the high ( matching ) scale , typically taken to be @xmath44 .",
    "secondly , the matching conditions for the coefficients of the operators at the high scale must be calculated at both the lo and nlo .",
    "thirdly , the anomalous dimension matrices for the relevant operators at both lo and nlo are determined and the coefficients are evolved to the @xmath14 scale via the renormalization group equations .",
    "lastly , at the scale @xmath45 the matrix elements of the relevant operators need to be computed through nlo . for the sm",
    "all of these pieces are now essentially in place for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays after an enormous amount of labor .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding results only partially exist for most of these pieces in almost all extensions to the sm@xcite .",
    "in order to be self - contained we briefly review the relevant parts of the lrm needed for the discussion below ; for details of the model the reader is referred to ref .",
    "the lrm is based on the extended gauge group @xmath46 and can lead to interesting new effects in the b system@xcite . due to the extended gauge structure",
    "there are both new neutral and charged gauge bosons , @xmath13 and @xmath47 , in addition to those present in the standard model . in this scenario the left-(right-)handed ( lh , rh ) fermions of the sm are assigned to doublets under the @xmath48 group and a rh neutrino is introduced .",
    "the higgs fields which can directly generate sm fermion masses are thus in bi - doublet representations , , they transform as doublets under both @xmath49 groups .",
    "the lrm is quite robust and possesses a large number of free parameters which play an interdependent role in the calculation of observables and in obtaining the existing constraints on the model resulting from various experiments .",
    "as far as b physics and the subsequent discussion are concerned there are several parameters of direct interest , most of which result from the structure and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended gauge sector .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 gauge couplings is bounded by @xmath52 , where the lower limit is a model constraint and the upper one is simply a naturalness assumption . whereas @xmath53 is directly related to @xmath54 as usual through @xmath55 , @xmath56 is unconstrained except through the definition of electric charge and naturalness arguments ; gut embedding scenarios generally suggest that @xmath57 . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath58 in most of our discussion below .",
    "the @xmath59 extended symmetry is broken down to the sm via the action of higgs fields that transform either as doublets as discussed above , or also possibly as triplets under @xmath50 .",
    "this choice of higgs representation determines both the mass relationship between the @xmath13 and @xmath60 ( analogous to the condition that @xmath61 in the sm ) as well as the nature of neutrino masses .",
    "in particular , the higgs triplet choice allows for the implementation of the see - saw mechanism and yields a heavy rh neutrino .",
    "we assume triplet breaking below so that the @xmath13 mass is completely specified by the @xmath60 mass and the value of @xmath62 .",
    "after complete symmetry breaking the @xmath63 and @xmath60 bosons mix ; this mixing being described by two parameters , a real mixing angle @xmath64 and a phase @xmath65 .",
    "note that it is usually @xmath66 which appears in expressions directly related to observables .",
    "the additional phase , as always , can be a new source of cp violation .",
    "however , in discussing processes in which the rh neutrinos do not participate , as is the case in b decays , this angle can be thought of as an overall phase of the right - handed ckm matrix , @xmath26 , and we will subsequently ignore it .",
    "the mixing between @xmath63 and @xmath60 results in the mass eigenstates @xmath67 , with a ratio of masses @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 ) . in most models",
    "@xmath70 is then naturally of order a few times @xmath71 , or less , in the large @xmath72 limit .",
    "of course , @xmath73 is the state directly being produced at both the tevatron and lepii and is identical to the sm @xmath18 in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "we note that when @xmath64 is non - zero , @xmath73 no longer couples to a purely lh current . of course if a heavy rh neutrino is indeed realized then the effective leptonic current coupling to @xmath73 remains purely lh as far as low energy experiments are concerned .",
    "as is well - known , one of the strongest classical constraints on this model arises from polarized @xmath45 decay@xcite , which is trivial to satisfy in this case .",
    "it is important to recall that the extended higgs sector associated with both the breaking of the full lrm gauge group down to @xmath75 and with the complete generation of fermion masses may also play an important role in low energy physics through the existence of complex yukawa and/or flavor - changing neutral current type couplings .",
    "however , this sector of the lrm is highly model dependent and is of course quite sensitive to the detailed nature of the fermion mass generation problem . for purposes of brevity and simplicity",
    "these too will be ignored in the following discussion and we will focus solely on the effects associated with @xmath67 exchange .",
    "additional parameters arise in the quark sector . in principle",
    "the effective mass matrices for the sm fermions may be non - hermitian implying that the two matrices involved in the bi - unitary transformation needed to diagonalize them will be unrelated .",
    "this means that the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath26 appearing in the rh charged current for quarks will be unrelated to the corresponding elements of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath26 will then involve 3 new angles as well as 6 additional phases all of which are _ a priori _ unknown parameters .",
    "needless to say the additional phases can be a further source of cp violation .",
    "the possibility that @xmath77 and @xmath26 may be unrelated is often overlooked when considering the potential impact of the lrm on low energy physics and there has been very little detailed exploration of this more general situation .",
    "clearly as the elements of @xmath26 are allowed to vary the impact of the extended gauge sector on b physics will be greatly affected .",
    "other well - known constraints on the lrm , such as universality , the apparent observed unitarity of the ckm matrix , @xmath78 mixing , the @xmath79 mass difference@xcite , as well as tevatron direct @xmath80 searches@xcite , are quite sensitive to variations in @xmath26@xcite , but @xmath81 masses as low as @xmath82 gev can be easily accommodated by the present data . to be safe and to keep future @xmath81 searches in mind , however , we will generally assume that @xmath83 gev for any form of @xmath26 , implying that the magnitude of @xmath70 is less than @xmath84 . in our numerical study below we will assume various different forms for @xmath26 ; in all cases we will assume for simplicity that the values of the elements of @xmath77 as extracted by current experiment@xcite are not much influenced by the existence of the new lrm interactions .",
    "an updated analysis on the possible general structure of @xmath26 has yet to be performed .      in order to study the potential influence of the lrm on @xmath3 physics various forms of @xmath26",
    "should be examined .",
    "in fact , the possibility that @xmath85 and that @xmath3 decays are _ purely _ right - handed was entertained some time ago by gronau and wakaizumi@xcite . just how large the right - handed contribution to @xmath86 transitions is allowed to be within the lrm context is not yet accurately known@xcite but may be sizeable in magnitude with an unknown relative phase .",
    "the experimental bounds are as follows .",
    "l3 has compared@xcite their measurements of both the lepton and missing energy spectra in semileptonic @xmath86 decays with a number of different hypotheses , and have excluded both the @xmath87 and @xmath88 scenarios , clearly indicating that this coupling is dominantly left - handed .",
    "this qualitative result is confirmed by the sign of the @xmath89 polarization observed by aleph@xcite at the @xmath17 pole .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from cleo@xcite , with measurements of both the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry as well as the @xmath90 polarization in the decay @xmath91 . on the theoretical side ,",
    "voloshin@xcite has recently considered how significant right - handed @xmath86 currents , at the @xmath92 level , may assist in our understanding of the @xmath3 semileptonic branching fraction . in a more general context , other forms of @xmath26 have been discussed by langacker and sankar@xcite upon which we generalize in the following analysis .    since we are not concerned with @xmath93 violation in what follows , for numerical simplicity we will ignore the phases in this matrix in which case it can be completely described by three mixing angles . even in this limiting scenario",
    "the set of possible forms for @xmath26 is enormous ; however , it is sufficient for our purposes here to simply examine some sample forms .",
    "we will assume that each row and column of @xmath26 contains only one large element with a magnitude near unity as is the true for the conventional ckm matrix .",
    "in this case there are only six matrices about which we can perturb ; we write these symbolically as @xmath94 for example , matrix d corresponds , in the standard ckm parameterization@xcite , to the situation where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are all @xmath97 .",
    "following wolfenstein@xcite , this suggests taking @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 are order unity , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "of course , all these parameters are not arbitrary since the experimental constraints from @xmath79 and @xmath104 mixing must be satisfied . for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , these bounds are trivially fulfilled , without further fine tuning , if @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for @xmath107 ,",
    "@xmath3 physics is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath109 so we take for simplicity @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this leaves us with a set of matrices we can label as @xmath112 , for n=1,2,3 , .... table 1 lists the complete set of parameterizations for all six types of @xmath26 mixing matrices , which we arrive at by following a similar procedure , and the constrained range of the exponents we use in the analysis below .",
    "the values of these powers reflect simplicity as well as that required to satisfy the low energy experimental constraints .",
    "[ @xmath26 matrices ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the inclusive rare decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been and will continue to be subjects of intense interest since they offer unique opportunities to probe for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "both these decay modes are quite clean theoretically and future @xmath3-factories will produce large event samples in both cases , allowing for in - depth studies of their associated observables . as we know , in the sm and in many of its extensions these decay observables can be expressed in terms of only three _ a priori _ unknown parameters , corresponding to the values of the wilson coefficients of three operators at the scale @xmath14 .",
    "the global fit approach provides the best model independent technique for obtaining the values of these coefficients at the low scale which can then be compared with the expectations of a given model . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated , using the left - right symmetric model as an example , that with the statistics available at future @xmath3-factories it will be possible to observe the rather unique situation where this global fit to the canonical three coefficients fails .",
    "this result would tell us that not only does new physics exist beyond the sm but that this new physics _ requires _ an extended operator basis .",

    "<S> in the standard model and many of its extensions , it is well known that all of the observables associated with the rare decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of the three wilson coefficients , @xmath2 , together with several universal kinematic functions . in particular it has been shown that the numerical values of these coefficients can be uniquely extracted by a three parameter global fit to data obtainable at future @xmath3-factories given sufficient integrated luminosity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine if such global fits are also sensitive to new operators beyond those which correspond to the above coefficients , , whether is it possible that new operators can be of sufficient importance for the three parameter fit to fail and for this to be experimentally observable . using the left - right symmetric model as an example of a scenario with an extended operator basis , we demonstrate via monte carlo techniques that such a possibility can indeed be realized . in some sense </S>",
    "<S> this potential failure of the global fit approach can actually be one of its greatest successes in identifying the existence of new physics .    </S>",
