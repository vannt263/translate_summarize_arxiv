    "deconvolution is an ubiquitous data processing method that arises in a variety of applications , _",
    "e.g. _ , biomedical imaging  @xcite , astronomy  , remote sensing  @xcite and video and photo enhancement  @xcite .",
    "formally , this problem amounts to recovering a signal @xmath0 from _ blurred _ and _ corrupted _ observations @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the _ convolution _ operation between @xmath0 and some other signal @xmath4 , while @xmath5 is a general function accounting for some corrupting noise , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath6 under an additive corruption model with some ( gaussian ) noise @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , when a scene is captured by an optical instrument , the observation is a blurred or degraded version of the original image , corrupted by noise and by some effects due to the instrument ( motion , out - of - focus , light scattering , ... ) . in such a case ,",
    "the imaging system is usually assumed to be well represented by the sensing model ( [ eq : blur - model ] ) where the ideal image @xmath0 is blurred by a point spread function ( psf ) @xmath4 .",
    "implicitly , the psf describes the response of the imaging device to a dirac point source , _ i.e. _ , the impulse response of the instrument , while @xmath5 can distinguish different sources of noise contaminating the , is an astronomical event where the moon or a planet move across the disk of the sun , hiding a part of it , as seen from the telescope .",
    "since the euv emission of transiting celestial bodies is zero , any apparent emission is known to be caused by the instrument .",
    "therefore , this type of event provides strong prior information that allows the regularization of the blind deconvolution problem .",
    "let us note that all these parametric methods present the disadvantage of being specific for a given instrument and depending on a good characterization of the psf , which is not always possible  @xcite .",
    "central to our work is the information provided by the transit of a celestial object whose apparent boundary on the recorded image can be predicted with high ( sub - pixel ) accuracy .",
    "this is typically the case for the observation of moon or venus transits for which ephemeris allows us to precisely know their apparent boundaries at the recording time , provided of course that _ (",
    "i ) _ the small variations of the object topography around a perfect disk ( _ e.g. _ , mountains , craters ) are smaller than a pixel width , and _",
    "( ii ) _ , that such a transitting object has no atmosphere that could blur its apparent boundary ( _ e.g. _ , as for an earth transit ) .",
    "as will be clear below , these hypotheses have been respected for at least two cases : for the instrument secchi / euvi during the 2007 lunar transit and for sdo / aia during the 2012 venus transit . for these two situations , and for any other transit respecting the conditions above , we know a priori the values for a set of pixels in the image and also their exact location .",
    "our work uses such information as constraint in the function to be optimized for blindly deconvolving images .",
    "notice that our approach could also be applied to other situations where pixel values and exact location are known a priori ( _ e.g. _ , dark calibration patterns in computer vision applications ) .",
    "contrarily to previous works in solar physics , the blind deconvolution method demonstrated in this paper is not based on a specific model of the psf , but infers it from the observed data .",
    "this allows the method to be used for estimating the psf of any instrument provided it has a prior information on a set of pixel values .",
    "since no model is imposed on the psf , the large number of unknowns makes the problem computationally intractable .",
    "we thus focus on the estimation of the psf core , which is defined as the central pixels encompassing at least @xmath8 of the total psf energy .",
    "note that this thresholding follows the radial energy characterization of the sdo / aia psf in the paper of poduval et al .",
    "@xcite and a similar study of the available psfs of secchi / euvi ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the psf core accounts for charge spreading , optical aberrations , and diffraction effects .",
    "note that the same algorithm would be able to handle a parametric model of the psf provided a precise instrument characterization is available . for simplicity",
    ", we consider an average additive gaussian noise model that gathers all sources of noise present in the observation .",
    "a detailed discussion on how to handle more general noise models is provided in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the proposed method is first tested through simulated realistic scenarios .",
    "results show the ability to estimate a given psf with high quality .",
    "we also show the importance of considering multiple transit observations in order to provide a better conditioning to the filter estimation problem .    we validate our method on aia and euvi observations using solar transits .",
    "the validation of the recovered filters is based on the reduction of the celestial body apparent emissions .",
    "the estimated psfs were also tested for images containing active regions .",
    "results show that , when recovering the psf core , the proposed non - parametric scheme can achieve similar results to parametric methods .",
    "also , we consider the case where the parametric psf is incorporated in the imaging model as an additional filter convolving the actual image  @xcite . we show that the resulting parametric / non - parametric psf provides better results than both parametric and non - parametric psfs estimated independently .",
    "let us note that , since parametric methods are based on the physics of the instrument , they tend to provide a more precise psf containing both the core and the diffraction peaks . however , when the telescope presents unknown or unexpected behavior , an accurate model of the filter can not be built .",
    "in such cases , we require non - parametric models , as the one presented in this paper , which due to their flexibility can handle better some instrument s properties .      in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the discrete forward model and the noise estimation . in section  [ sec : bid ] we present the formulation of the blind deconvolution problem based on the image and filter prior information . section  [ sec : am ] describes the alternating minimization method used for estimating the filter and the image .",
    "it briefly presents the method , including the initialization , the parameter estimation , the stopping criteria and the numerical reconstruction . in section  [ sec : nbid ] we present a non - blind deconvolution method that is used for the experimental validation . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results on both synthetic and experimental data for the aia and euvi telescopes .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath49 .",
    "the convolution operation , represented by @xmath3 , consists of integrating portions of the actual scene weighted by the psf . in the following ,",
    "we consider a discrete setting where the convolution integration is represented by a discrete sum .",
    "let us consider that , during the transit , the euv telescope acquires a set of @xmath50 images containing a celestial body .",
    "in order to limit the computation time , the effective field - of - view ( fov ) of each observation is restricted to an image patch centered on the transiting celestial body with a size several times bigger than the body apparent diameter .",
    "the effects of this fov truncation will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : bid ] and section  [ sec : results ] . in our work ,",
    "all @xmath51 images are represented as @xmath52 vectors so that linear transformations of images are identifiable with matrices .",
    "each observed patch is a collection of values gathered in a vector @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "the observed values are modeled as a true image @xmath55 convolved by the instrument s psf ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the psf is assumed to be spatially and temporally invariant , thus is the same for each observed patch . for simplicity",
    ", we consider that all sources of noise present in the observation can be gathered in an average noise model , which is assumed to be additive , white and gaussian .",
    "the observations are then assumed to be affected by an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "the acquisition process of the telescope is thus modeled as follows : @xmath59 this model assumes that the observed images @xmath60 are uncompressed and have been corrected for ccd effects ( dark current removal , flat fielding , despiking ) . in the case of sdo / aia , this corresponds to level 1 data processing .    in 1-d",
    ", the discrete circular convolution @xmath61 of a vector @xmath62 with a filter @xmath63 can always be described by the product of @xmath17 with a circulant matrix @xmath64 _ i.e. _ , a matrix where every row is a right cyclic shift of the _ kernel _",
    "@xmath65  @xcite . in 2-d and in particular for the model ( [ eq : discrete_model_vector ] ) , the convolution of @xmath66 by @xmath4 can still be represented by the multiplication of @xmath66 by matrix @xmath67 that is now _ block - circulant with circulant blocks _ , _ i.e. _ , a matrix made of @xmath51 blocks , each block being a @xmath68 circulant matrix representing the action of one row of the 2-d filter @xmath4 in  ( [ eq : discrete_model_vector ] ) .",
    "if we gather the @xmath50 true images in a single matrix @xmath69 , the acquisition model can be transformed into the following matrix form : @xmath70 with @xmath71 two matrices that similarly gather the @xmath50 observed images and their noises , respectively .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and to keep fast numerical methods , the model  ( [ eq : discrete_model_matrix ] ) implicitly considers an additive noise model . a way to generalize our method to",

    "a first guess of the noise variance @xmath47 can be estimated using the robust median estimator ( @xmath76 )  @xcite , which is based on the assumption that the noise is an additional high frequency component in the observed signal .",
    "more details on this variance estimation are provided in section  [ sec : expdata ] .",
    "let us note that the variance could also be obtained from the physical noise characteristics using , for instance , dark areas in the images to estimate the dark noise .",
    "however , such computations may not consider all the noise sources present in the observations , providing an underestimation of the actual variance .    in this work ,",
    "we prefer to adopt another strategy .",

    "compared to a frequency representation , as obtained by the fourier transform , a 2-d wavelet transform allows to represent images with a _ multi - resolution _",
    "scheme  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , with a linear combination of localized _ wave atoms _ , with variable sizes and locations , whose number is much smaller than the initial number of pixels .",
    "most inverse problems in imaging are regularized using a synthesis wavelet prior , _",
    "i.e. _ , promoting the synthesis of the estimated image with as few ` wavelets ' as possible ( sparsity criterion )  .",
    "more recently , better inversion results have been obtained using _",

    "dictionary_. this set can be much larger than an orthonormal basis and hence it can efficiently capture much more different image features .",
    "following this recent trend , we decide to adopt such an analysis prior that , in opposition to the synthesis framework , also allows us to work directly on the image domain without increasing the dimensionality of the optimization problem . as a dictionary",
    ", we use the system associated to the undecimated discrete wavelet transform ( udwt )  @xcite .",
    "the udwt can also be seen as the union of all translations of an orthonormal dwt .",
    "conversely to the dwt , this makes the udwt translation invariant , _",
    "i.e. _ , it enables an efficient characterization of all image features whatever their location  @xcite , hence providing a better image reconstruction than the traditional dwt .    in this context , we assume that , if we represent the image candidate on a redundant wavelet dictionary @xmath93 made of @xmath94 vectors in @xmath95 , the wavelet coefficients are sparse , _",
    "i.e. _ , the coefficients matrix @xmath96 has few important values and its @xmath97-norm ( computed over all its entries ) is expected to be small .",
    "however , the wavelet coefficients whose support touches the boundary of the moon or venus disk are not sparse .",
    "hence , we do not consider in this prior model those coefficients that are affected by the occulting body . also , we follow a common practice in the field which removes the ( unsparse ) scaling coefficients  @xcite from the @xmath97-norm computation .",
    "the set of _ detail _ coefficients that are not affected by the black disk is denoted by @xmath5 , with @xmath98 .",
    "see section  [ sec : synthdata ] for further details on how to compute the set @xmath5 .",
    "the matrix @xmath99 is the corresponding selection operator that extracts from any coefficients vector @xmath100 only its components indexed by @xmath5 .",
    "the global prior information can thus be exploited by promoting a small @xmath97-norm on the wavelet coefficients belonging to @xmath5 .",
    "the rationale of this prior is to enforce noise canceling and avoid artifacts in the reconstructed image .",

    "since the filter is not known a priori and it changes from one instrument to another , we are interested in adding soft constraints that are common to most solar euv telescopes .",
    "we are not aiming at reconstructing all of the psf s components but rather at estimating its core , which is responsible for most of the diffused light .",
    "we first consider that , since the psf corresponds to an observation of a point , it is non - negative everywhere . additionally , by assuming that the amount of light entering in the instrument is preserved , the @xmath97-norm of the filter candidate must be equal to one .",
    "this is explained by taking the sum over the pixels of one observed patch in ( [ eq : discrete_model_matrix ] ) , which is equal to @xmath101 in a noiseless process .",
    "since the filter is non - negative , taking its @xmath97-norm equal to one is equivalent to @xmath102 , which results in @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the light is preserved .",
    "therefore , the filter candidate must belong to the probability simplex @xcite , defined as @xmath104 .",
    "one important assumption in our proposed method is that the filter candidate is of size @xmath105 , for any @xmath106 , and is centered in the spatial origin of the discrete grid .",
    "this means that the filter candidate has a limited support inside a set @xmath107 of size @xmath108 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the filter has only important values in the central pixels and is negligible beyond the considered support .",
    "this allows us to work with a patch ( only a part of the observation ) and not with the complete fov of the instrument in order to reduce the computation time .",
    "euv images have a high dynamic range .",
    "hence , due to long - range effects , a given pixel value can be affected by the value of another high intensity pixel located as far as 100 arcsec away for sdo / aia  @xcite and 1500 arcsec away for secchi / euvi @xcite . in such cases , despite a psf that can rapidly decay far from its center , the high intensity pixel can induce a long - range effect that is not taken into account by a filter with truncated support .",
    "let us define the complementary set of @xmath107 as @xmath109 \\backslash \\gamma$ ] , with @xmath110 .",
    "we assume that the actual psf is composed by two different filters : the psf core with support on @xmath107 , denoted by @xmath111 , which accounts for short - range effects , and another one , denoted @xmath112 with support on @xmath113 , accounting for long - range effects , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath114 . an accurate estimation of the long - range psf is out of the scope of this work .",
    "its effect inside the disk of the celestial body is modeled as a constant @xmath115 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath116 ( see appendix  [ sec : long_range_psf ] for more details ) . for a given patch , the acquisition model in ( [ eq : discrete_model_vector ] ) can then be approximated as : @xmath117 in this work , we aim at estimating only the psf core , which is called @xmath4 hereafter .",
    "the effect of the long - range psf , denoted by @xmath115 , is computed in a preprocessing stage by the average value inside the center of several observed transit disks ( see section [ sec : expdata ] ) .",
    "this simple estimation is motivated by the presence of a systematic intensity background at the center of each observed disk transit .",
    "this one is quite independent of the sun activity around such disk and its mean intensity ( few tens of dns ) is also far above the estimated noise level ( few dns ) . in a future work",
    "we plan to replace this rough evaluation by a joint estimation of the value of @xmath115 with the filter and the image ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for some discussions ) .",
    "notice that our method could allow the addition of other convex constraints , _",
    "e.g. _ , if we know that the filter is sparse or that @xmath118 , for some upper bound @xmath119 on @xmath120 such as a specific power law decay .",
    "however , we will not consider this possibility here as we want to stay as agnostic as possible on the properties of the filter to reconstruct .      from sections",
    "[ sec : imageprior ] and [ sec : filterprior ] , we can formulate the following regularized blind deconvolution problem : @xmath121 with @xmath81 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 cancels the long - range part of the filter .",

    "this essential parameter is estimated in appendix  [ sec : param ] .",
    "it is important to note that the prior information related to the darkness of the occulting body ( @xmath125 if @xmath89 ) , which is crucial in the regularization of the blind deconvolution problem , is taken into account in the first constraint in ( [ eq : bid2 ] ) .",
    "the problem of estimating the image and the filter in ( [ eq : bid2 ] ) can also be written as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the objective function , with @xmath128 the modified observations .",

    "we describe how to stop the iterations so that the vicinity of a critical point of ( [ eq : bid3 ] ) is reached .",

    "it is important to find an automatic criterion for stopping the iterations in ( [ eq : alternating_attouch ] ) when the solution reaches the vicinity of a critical point of ( [ eq : bid3 ] ) .",
    "a usual stopping criterion is based on the quality of the reconstruction with respect to the ground truth image and filter , which are in general unavailable . as proposed by almeida and figueiredo  @xcite",

    "this allows stopping the minimization when a high quality solution has been obtained .",
    "let us define each residual image at iteration @xmath140 as the difference between the observed image and the blurred estimate : @xmath141    since the observation model is degraded by an additive white noise , we know that the residual image is spectrally white if the estimation at iteration @xmath140 has a good quality , otherwise the residual contains structured artifacts . therefore , the iterations can be stopped when the residual is spectrally white , _",

    "therefore , it is important to properly handle the frontiers of our images and avoid both implicit fft frontier periodizations and the influence of unobserved image values integrated by the filter extension . inspired by the work of @xcite , we implement their _ * unknown * boundary conditions _ , where instead of expanding the observation using zero - padding as in , the boundaries are considered unknown in the convolution process and then , by properly selecting the pixels inside the known boundaries , the observed image is obtained . in a nutshell , the unknown boundary conditions method proceeds by considering every convolution in a bigger space obtained by expanding the original one by the radius of the filter in all directions , _",

    "<S> _ context : _ characterization of instrumental effects in astronomical imaging is important in order to extract accurate physical information from the observations . the measured image in a real optical instrument is usually represented by the convolution of an ideal image with a point spread function ( psf ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the image acquisition process is also contaminated by other sources of noise ( read - out , photon - counting ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of estimating both the psf and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is ill - posed .    </S>",
    "<S> _ aims : _ we propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image regularization . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to most methods presented in the literature , our method does not assume a parametric model of the psf and can thus be applied to any telescope .    _ </S>",
    "<S> methods : _ our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak assumptions on the psf . </S>",
    "<S> we use observations from a celestial transit , where the occulting body can be assumed to be a black disk . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints allow us to retain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image , eliminating trivial , translated and interchanged solutions . under an additive gaussian noise assumption </S>",
    "<S> , they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction artifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred observations and the cleaned data .    _ </S>",
    "<S> results : _ our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data . the psf is estimated for the secchi / euvi instrument using the 2007 lunar transit , and for sdo / aia using the 2012 venus transit . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the proposed non - parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the psf with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , if these parametric estimations are incorporated in the acquisition model , the resulting psf outperforms both the parametric and non - parametric methods . </S>"
