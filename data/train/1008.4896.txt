    "cooperative communication promises significant gains in the performance of wireless networks over traditional techniques that treat the network as comprised of point - to - point links .",
    "cooperative communication protocols exploit the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions and offer spatial diversity gains by making use of multiple relays for cooperative transmissions .",
    "this can increase the reliability and reduce the energy cost of data transmissions in wireless networks .",
    "see @xcite for a recent comprehensive survey .",
    "most prior work in the area of cooperative communication has investigated physical layer techniques such as orthogonal repetition coding / signaling @xcite , distributed beamforming @xcite , distributed space - time codes @xcite , etc .",
    "all these techniques perform _ energy accumulation _ from multiple transmissions to decode a packet . in energy accumulation ,",
    "a receiver can decode a packet when the total received energy from multiple transmissions of that packet exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "an alternate approach of recent interest is based on _ mutual information accumulation _ @xcite@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a node accumulates mutual information for a packet from multiple transmissions until it can be decoded successfully .",
    "this is shown to outperform energy accumulation based schemes , particularly in the high snr regime , in @xcite@xcite .",
    "such a scheme can be implemented in practice using rateless codes of which fountain and raptor codes @xcite are two examples .",
    "rateless codes encode information bits into potentially infinite - length codewords .",
    "subsequently , additional parity bits are sent by the transmitter until the receiver is able to decode .",
    "the decoding procedure at the receiver is carried out using belief propagation algorithms .",
    "for an overview of the working of fountain , lt , and raptor codes , we refer to the excellent survey in @xcite .",
    "in addition to allowing mutual information accumulation , rateless codes provide further advantages over traditional fixed rate schemes in the context of fading relay networks as discussed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "unlike fixed rate code schemes in which knowledge of the current channel state information ( csi ) is required at the transmitters , rateless codes adapt to the channel conditions without requiring csi .",
    "this advantage becomes even more important in large networks where the cost of csi acquisition grows exponentially with the network size .",
    "however , this introduces deep memory in the system because mutual information accumulated from potentially multiple transmissions in the past can be used to decode a packet .    in this paper",
    ", we study three problems on optimal routing and scheduling over a multi - hop wireless network using mutual information accumulation .",
    "specifically , we first consider a network with a single source - destination pair and @xmath0 relay nodes .",
    "when a node transmits , the other nodes accumulate mutual information at a rate that depends on their incoming link capacity .",
    "all nodes operate under bandwidth and energy constraints as described in detail in section [ section : model ] .",
    "we consider three problems in this setting . in the first problem ,",
    "the transmit power levels of the nodes are fixed and the objective is to transmit a packet from the source to the destination in minimum delay ( section [ section : min_delay_routing ] ) . in the second problem ,",
    "the transmit power levels are variable and the objective is to minimize the sum total energy to deliver a packet to the destination subject to a delay constraint ( section [ section : related_problem ] ) . in the third problem , we consider the network model with fixed transmit power levels ( similar to the first problem ) and with a single source where the objective is to broadcast a packet to all the other nodes in minimum delay ( section [ section : third_problem ] ) .",
    "all of these objectives are important in a variety of networking scenarios .",
    "related problems of optimal routing in wireless networks with multi - receiver diversity have been studied in @xcite while problems of optimal cooperative diversity routing and broadcasting are treated in @xcite and references therein .",
    "although these formulations incorporate the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions , they assume that the outcome of each transmission is a binary success / failure .",
    "further , any packet that can not be successfully decoded in one transmission is discarded .",
    "this is significantly different from the scenario considered in this paper where nodes can accumulate partial information about a packet from different transmissions over time .",
    "this can be thought of as networking with `` soft '' information .",
    "prior work on accumulating partial information from multiple transmissions includes the work in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite considers the problem of minimum energy unicast routing in wireless networks with energy accumulation and shows that it is an np - complete problem .",
    "similar results are obtained for the problem of minimum energy _",
    "accumulative broadcast _ in @xcite",
    ". a related problem of _ accumulative multicast _ is studied in @xcite .",
    "minimum energy unicast routing with energy accumulation only at the destination is considered in @xcite .",
    "the work closest to ours is @xcite which treats the minimum delay routing problem with mutual information accumulation .",
    "both @xcite@xcite develop an lp based formulation for their respective problems that involves solving a linear program for _ every possible ordering _ of relay nodes over all subsets of relay nodes to derive the optimal solution .",
    "thus , for a network with @xmath0 relay nodes , this exhaustive approach requires solving @xmath1 linear programs .",
    "the primary challenge associated with solving the problems addressed in this paper is their inherent combinatorial nature .",
    "unlike traditional shortest path routing problems , the cost of routing with mutual information accumulation depends not only on the set of nodes in the routing path , but also their _ relative ordering _ in the transmission sequence , making standard shortest path algorithms inapplicable .",
    "therefore , we approach the problem differently . to derive the optimal transmission strategy for the first problem , we first formulate an optimization problem in section [ section : formulation ] that optimizes over all possible transmission orderings over all subsets of relay nodes ( similar to @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "this approach clearly has a very high complexity of @xmath2 . then",
    "in section [ section : central ] , we prove a key structural property of the optimal solution that allows us to simplify the problem and derive a simple greedy algorithm that only needs to optimize over all subsets of nodes .",
    "further , it does not require solving any linear programs .",
    "thus , it has a complexity of @xmath3 .",
    "we derive a greedy algorithm of the same complexity for the second problem in section [ section : related_problem ] .",
    "we note that this complexity , while still exponential , is a significant improvement over solving @xmath2 linear programs .",
    "for example , with @xmath4 , this requires @xmath5 runs of a simple greedy algorithm as compared to @xmath6 runs of an lp solver .",
    "note that for small networks , ( say , @xmath7 ) , it is reasonable to use our algorithm to exactly compute the optimal solution .",
    "further , for larger @xmath0 it provides a feasible way to compute the optimal solution as a benchmark when comparing against simpler heuristics .    for the minimum delay broadcast problem",
    ", we identify a similar structural property of the optimal solution in section [ section : third_problem ] that allows us to simplify the problem and derive a simple greedy algorithm .",
    "while this greedy algorithm still has a complexity of @xmath2 , it does not require solving any linear programs and thus improves over the result in @xcite that requires solving @xmath8 linear programs .",
    "in general , we expect all these problems to be np - complete based on the results in @xcite . for the special case of a line topology , we derive the exact optimal solution in section [ section : line_network ]",
    ". finally , in section [ section : distributed ] , we propose two simple heuristics that can be implemented in polynomial time and in a distributed fashion and compare them with the optimal solution .",
    "simulations suggest that both heuristics perform quite close to the optimal solution over random network topologies .    before proceeding",
    ", we note that the techniques we apply to get these structural results can also be applied to similar problems that use energy accumulation instead of mutual information accumulation .",
    "relay nodes . when a node transmits , every other node that has not yet decoded the packet accumulates mutual information at a rate given by the capacity of the link between the transmitter and that node.,width=245,height=151 ]",
    "the network model consists of a source @xmath9 , destination @xmath10 and @xmath0 relays @xmath11 as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : one ] .",
    "there are no time variations in the channel states .",
    "this models the scenario where the coherence time of the channels is larger than any considered transmission time of the encoded bits . in the first two problems ,",
    "the source has a packet to be delivered to the destination . in the third problem ,",
    "the source packet must to delivered to all nodes in the network .",
    "each node @xmath12 transmits at a fixed power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath13 ( in units of joules / sec / hz ) that is uniform across its transmission band .",
    "however , the transmission duration for a node is variable and is a design parameter .",
    "the total available bandwidth is @xmath14 hz .",
    "a node can transmit the packet only if it has fully decoded the packet .",
    "for this , it must accumulate _ at least _",
    "@xmath15 bits of total mutual information .",
    "all transmissions happen on orthogonal channels in time or frequency and at most one node can transmit over a frequency channel at any given time .",
    "the channel gain between nodes @xmath12 and @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 which is independent of the frequency channel .",
    "however , this is not necessarily known at the transmitting nodes .    under this assumption ,",
    "the minimum transmission time under the two orthogonal schemes ( where nodes transmit in orthogonal time vs. frequency channels ) is the same . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the case where transmissions are orthogonal in time .",
    "when a node @xmath12 transmits , every other node @xmath16 that does not have the full packet yet , receives mutual information at a rate that depends on the transmission capacity @xmath18 ( in units of bits / sec / hz ) of link @xmath19 .",
    "this transmission capacity itself depends on the transmit power @xmath13 and channel strength @xmath17 .",
    "for example , for an awgn channel , using shannon s formula , this is given by @xmath20 $ ] where @xmath21 is the psd of the noise process .",
    "specifically , if node @xmath12 transmits for duration @xmath22 over bandwidth @xmath14 , then node @xmath16 accumulates @xmath23 bits of information . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath24 for simplicity .",
    "we assume that nodes use independently generated _ ideal _ rateless codes so that the mutual information collected by a node from different transmissions add up .",
    "we can incorporate the non - idealities of practical rateless codes by multiplying @xmath18 with a factor @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the overhead .",
    "a similar model has been considered in @xcite .",
    "under the modeling assumptions discussed in section [ section : model ] , the problem of routing a packet from the source to the destination with minimum delay consists of the following sub - problems :    * first , which subset of relay nodes should take part in forwarding the packet ? * second , in what order should these nodes transmit ? * and third , what should be the transmission durations for these nodes ?",
    "we next discuss the transmission structure of a general policy under this model .",
    "consider any transmission strategy @xmath27 for routing the packet to the destination in the model described above .",
    "this includes the choice of the relay set , the transmission order for this set , and the transmission durations for each node in this set .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the subset of relay nodes that take part in the routing process under strategy @xmath27 . by this ,",
    "we mean that each node in @xmath28 is able to decode the packet before the destination and then transmits for a non - zero duration . there could be other nodes that are able to decode the packet before the destination , but these do not take part in the forwarding process and are therefore not included in the set @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the size of this set .",
    "also , let @xmath30 be the ordering of nodes in @xmath28 that describes the sequence in which nodes in @xmath28 successfully decode the packet under strategy @xmath27 . without loss of generality , let the relay nodes in the ordering @xmath30 be indexed as @xmath31 . also , let the source @xmath9 be indexed as @xmath32 and the destination @xmath10 be indexed as @xmath33 .",
    "initially , only the source has the packet",
    ". let @xmath34 be the time when it starts its transmission and let @xmath35 denote the times when relays @xmath36 in the ordering @xmath30 accumulate enough mutual information to decode the packet .",
    "also , let @xmath37 be the time when the destination decodes the packet . by definition , @xmath38 .",
    "we say that the transmission occurs over @xmath33 stages , where stage @xmath39 represents the interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the state of the network at any time is given by the set of nodes that have the full packet and the mutual information accumulated so far at all the other nodes .",
    "note that in any stage @xmath16 , the first @xmath16 nodes in the ordering @xmath30 and the source have the fully decoded packet .",
    "thus , any subset of these nodes ( including potentially all of them ) may transmit during this stage .",
    "then the time - slot structure for the transmissions can be depicted as in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "note that in each stage , the set of relays that have successfully decoded the packet increases by one ( we ignore those relays that are not part of the set @xmath28 ) .",
    "we are now ready to formulate the problem of minimum delay routing with mutual information accumulation .      for each @xmath16 , define the duration of stage @xmath16 as @xmath41 .",
    "also , let @xmath42 denote the transmission duration for node @xmath12 in stage @xmath16 under strategy @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath43 if @xmath44 , else @xmath45 .",
    "this is because node @xmath12 does not have the full packet until the end of stage @xmath46 .",
    "the total time to deliver the packet to the destination @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 .",
    "for any transmission strategy @xmath27 that uses the subset of relay nodes @xmath28 with an ordering @xmath30 , the minimum delay is given by the solution to the following optimization problem : @xmath49 here , the first constraint captures the requirement that node @xmath50 in the ordering must accumulate at least @xmath15 amount of mutual information by the end of stage @xmath51 using all transmissions in all stages up to stage @xmath51 .",
    "the second constraint means that in every stage @xmath16 , the total transmission time for all nodes that have the fully decoded packet in that stage can not exceed the length of that stage .    it can be seen that the above problem is a linear program and thus can be solved efficiently for a given relay set @xmath28 and its ordering @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , this is the approach taken in @xcite that proposes solving such a linear program for _ every possible ordering of relays _ for each subset of the set of relay nodes .",
    "while such an approach is guaranteed to find the optimal solution , it has a huge computational complexity of @xmath2 linear programs . in the next section",
    ", we show that the above computation can be simplified significantly by making use of a structural property of the optimal solution .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the subset of relay nodes that take part in the routing process in the optimal solution .",
    "let @xmath53 be the size of this set .",
    "also , let @xmath54 be the optimal ordering .",
    "note that , by definition , each node in @xmath52 transmits for a non - zero duration ( else , we can remove it from the set without affecting the minimum total transmission time ) .",
    "then , we have the following :    under the optimal solution to the minimum delay routing problem ( [ eq : min_delay ] ) , in each stage @xmath16 , it is optimal for only one node to transmit , and that node is node @xmath16 .",
    "[ thm : min_delay ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] shows the timeslot structure under the optimal solution .",
    "the above theorem shows that only one node transmits in each stage , and that the optimal transmission ordering is the same as the ordering that nodes in the set @xmath52 decode the packet . comparing this with the general timeslot structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , it can be seen that theorem [ thm : min_delay ] simplifies problem ( @xmath55 ) significantly . specifically , theorem",
    "[ thm : min_delay ] implies that , _ given the optimal relay set _ @xmath52 , the optimal transmission structure ( i.e. , the decoding order and the transmission durations ) can be computed in a _",
    "greedy _ fashion as follows .",
    "first , the source starts to transmit and continues to do so until any relay node in this set gets the packet . once this relay node gets the packet , we know from theorem [ thm : min_delay ] that the source does not transmit in any of the remaining stages .",
    "this node then starts to transmit until another node in the set gets the packet .",
    "this process continues until the destination is able to decode the packet .",
    "the optimal solution to ( @xmath55 ) can then be obtained by applying this greedy transmission strategy to all subsets of relay nodes and picking one that yields the minimum delay .",
    "is similar to the _ wavepath property _ shown in @xcite for the problem of minimum energy unicast routing with energy accumulation in wireless networks .",
    "however , our proof technique is significantly different . ]",
    "note that applying this greedy transmission strategy does not require solving an lp .",
    "while searching over all subsets still has an exponential complexity of @xmath3 , it can be used to compute the optimal solution as a benchmark .",
    "theorem [ thm : min_delay ] also implies that multiple copies of the packet need not be maintained across the network .",
    "for example , note that the source need not transmit after the first relay has decoded the packet and therefore can drop the packet from its queue .",
    "we emphasize that the optimal transmission structure suggested by theorem [ thm : min_delay ] is not obvious .",
    "for example , at the beginning of any stage , the newest addition to the set of relay nodes with the full packet may not have the best links ( in terms of transmission capacity ) to all the remaining nodes , including the destination .",
    "this would suggest that under the optimal solution , in general in each stage , nodes with the full packet should take turns transmitting the packet .",
    "however , theorem [ thm : min_delay ] states that such time - sharing is not required .    before proceeding , we present a preliminary lemma that is used in the proof of theorem [ thm : min_delay ] . consider any linear program : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "then we have the following :    let @xmath58 be an optimal solution to the problem ( [ eq : inactive ] ) such that @xmath59 ( where the inequality is taken entry wise ) .",
    "then @xmath58 is still an optimal solution when the constraint @xmath60 is removed .",
    "[ lem : inactive_const ]    lemma [ lem : inactive_const ] implies that removing an _ inactive _ constraint does not affect the optimal solution of the linear program .",
    "this is a simple fact and its proof is provided for completeness in appendix a.    _ ( theorem [ thm : min_delay ] ) : _ note that theorem [ thm : min_delay ] trivially holds in stage @xmath32 ( since only the source has the full packet in this stage ) .",
    "next , it is easy to see that in the last stage ( i.e. , stage @xmath61 ) , only the node with the _ best _ link ( in terms of transmission capacity ) to the destination in the set @xmath52 should transmit in order to minimize the total delay .",
    "this is because this node will take the smallest time to transmit the remaining amount of mutual information needed by @xmath10 to decode the packet .",
    "further , we claim that this node must be the node @xmath61 in the ordering @xmath54 .",
    "this can be argued as follows .",
    "assume that the node with the best link to the destination in the set @xmath52 has the full packet at some stage @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 ) _ before _ the start of stage @xmath61 .",
    "then a smaller delay can be achieved by having only this node transmit after it has decoded the full packet from that stage onwards .",
    "thus , the other nodes labeled @xmath64 in the transmission order do not transmit , a contradiction .",
    "this shows that under the optimal solution , in the last stage @xmath61 , only node @xmath61 in the ordering @xmath54 transmits . using induction",
    ", we now show that in every prior stage @xmath62 where @xmath65 , only one node needs to transmit and that this node must be node @xmath66 in the ordering @xmath54 .",
    "consider the @xmath67 stage . at time",
    "@xmath68 , all nodes except @xmath61 and @xmath10 have decoded the packet .",
    "let the mutual information state at nodes @xmath61 and @xmath10 at time @xmath68 be @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "also , suppose in the @xmath67 stage , relay nodes @xmath71 and the source transmit a fraction @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the total duration of stage @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 respectively .",
    "note that these fractions must add to @xmath76 since it is suboptimal to have any idle time ( where no one is transmitting ) .",
    "then , the optimal solution must solve the following optimization problem : @xmath77 here , the first constraint states that relay @xmath61 must accumulate at least @xmath15 bits of mutual information by the end of stage @xmath74 .",
    "the second constraint states that the destination must accumulate at least @xmath15 bits of mutual information by the end of stage @xmath61 . note that in the last term of the left hand side of the second constraint , we have used the fact that only node @xmath61 transmits during stage @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that under the optimal solution , the first and second constraints must be met with equality .",
    "this simply follows from the definition of the beginning of any stage @xmath16 as the time when node @xmath16 has just decoded the packet .",
    "next , let @xmath78 for all @xmath79 . since @xmath80 , we have that @xmath81 and ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 1 ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath82 note that problems ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 3 ] ) are equivalent because we can transform ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 3 ] ) to the original problem by using the relations @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "next we multiply the minimization objective in ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 3 ] ) by @xmath89 without changing the problem . then , using the second equality constraint to eliminate @xmath90 from the objective and ignoring the constant terms , ( [ eq : stagek-1 - 3 ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath91 this optimization problem is linear in @xmath92 with a single linear equality constraint and thus the solution is of the form where all except one @xmath92 are zero . since @xmath84 , we have that in the optimal solution , exactly one of the fractions @xmath93 is equal to @xmath76 and rest must be @xmath32 .",

    "the intuition behind this heuristic is that while @xmath254 is expected to be a good cooperative set , this allows the algorithm to explore more nodes and potentially improve over heuristic @xmath76 .    in our simulations ,",
    "we consider a network of a source , destination , and @xmath0 relay nodes located in a @xmath256 area .",
    "the location of source @xmath257 and destination @xmath258 is fixed while the locations of the other nodes are chosen uniformly at random . the link gain between any two nodes @xmath12 and @xmath16 is chosen from a rayleigh distribution with mean @xmath76 .",
    "for simplicity , all nodes have the same psd . the total bandwidth @xmath14 and packet size @xmath259 are both normalized to one unit . the transmission capacity of link @xmath19 is assumed to be @xmath260 where @xmath126 is the distance between nodes @xmath12 and @xmath16 and @xmath261 is the path loss exponent .",
    "we choose @xmath262 for all simulations .",

    "[ fig : five ] .",
    "we then compute the traditional minimum delay route and the optimal solution for routing with mutual information accumulation using the greedy algorithm of section [ section : central ] .",
    "we also implement heuristics @xmath76 and @xmath170 on this network .",
    "[ fig : five ] shows the results .",
    "it is seen that the traditional minimum delay route is given by @xmath264 $ ] while the optimal mutual information accumulation route ( according to the decoding order ) is given by @xmath265 $ ] .",
    "the decoding order of nodes under heuristic @xmath76 is same as that under the traditional minimum delay route while that under heuristic @xmath170 is given by @xmath266 $ ] .",
    "the total delay under traditional minimum delay routing , heuristic @xmath76 , heuristic @xmath170 , and optimal mutual information accumulation routing was found to be @xmath267 and @xmath268 seconds respectively .",
    "this example demonstrates that the optimal route under mutual information accumulation can be quite different from the traditional minimum delay path .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the set of nodes in @xmath254 is a subset of the cooperative relay set in this example .",
    "however , this does not hold in general .",
    "we also note that the delay under both heuristics @xmath76 and @xmath170 is close to the optimal value .",
    "finally , while heuristic @xmath76 only uses the nodes in @xmath254 , heuristic @xmath170 explores more and ends up using node @xmath269 as well .    in the second simulation ,",
    "we choose @xmath270 .",
    "the source and destination locations are fixed as before but the locations of the relay nodes are varied randomly over @xmath271 instances . for each topology instance , we compute the minimum delay obtained by these @xmath272 algorithms . in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] , we plot the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the ratio of the minimum delay under the two heuristics and the traditional shortest path to the minimum delay under the optimal mutual information accumulation solution . from this",
    ", it can be seen that both heuristic @xmath76 and @xmath170 perform quite well over general network topologies .",
    "in fact , they are able to achieve the optimal performance @xmath273 and @xmath274 of the time respectively .",
    "further , they are within @xmath275 of the optimal at least @xmath276 of the time and within @xmath277 of the optimal at least @xmath278 of the time . also , heuristic @xmath170 is seen to outperform heuristic @xmath76 in general .",
    "finally , the average delay in routing with mutual information accumulation was found to be @xmath279 of the average delay of traditional shortest path routing ( where the average is taken over the @xmath271 random topologies ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that once the optimal relay set is computed , the only overhead of a mutual information accumulation based scheme over traditional shortest path is in the decoding and re - encoding operations . in particular , such schemes only require a 1-bit feedback from a receiver when it has successfully decoded the packet and do not require sophisticated synchronization , coordination , or extensive channel state information feedback .",
    "in this work , we considered three problems involving optimal routing and scheduling over a multi - hop wireless network using mutual information accumulation .",
    "we formulated the general problems as combinatorial optimization problems and then made use of several structural properties to simplify their solutions and derive optimal greedy algorithms .",
    "a key feature of these algorithms is that unlike prior works on these problems , they do not require solving any linear programs to compute the optimal solution .",
    "while these greedy algorithms still have exponential complexity , they are significantly simpler than prior schemes and allow us to compute the optimal solution as a benchmark .",
    "we also proposed two simple and practical heuristics that exhibit very good performance when compared to the optimal solution .",
    "we argue by contradiction .",
    "suppose an optimal solution to ( [ eq : inactive ] ) without the constraint @xmath60 is given by @xmath280 .",
    "then , we have that @xmath281 .",
    "further , @xmath282 satisfies all the constraints we did not remove , but must violate at least one of the constraints that we removed .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath283 and @xmath284 . now let @xmath285 be a convex combination of @xmath58 and @xmath282 , i.e. , @xmath286 where @xmath287 .",
    "we have that @xmath288 .",
    "since @xmath289 , we have that @xmath290 .",
    "since @xmath58 satisfies the strict inequality constraint @xmath291 in all entries , there must be a ball about @xmath58 that still satisfies the constraint @xmath60 .",
    "further , the line segment joining @xmath58 and @xmath282 intersects this ball .",
    "let us choose @xmath292 such that @xmath285 is this point of intersection .",
    "then @xmath285 still satisfies the constraint @xmath293 .",
    "however , @xmath294 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath58 solves ( [ eq : inactive ] ) optimally .",

    "next , suppose @xmath298 and @xmath299 . also , let @xmath300 .",

    "suppose node @xmath76 uses transmit power @xmath169 .",
    "then , the time for node @xmath170 to decode if node @xmath76 continues to transmit is given by : @xmath305 similarly , the time for node @xmath143 to decode if node @xmath76 continues to transmit is given by : @xmath306 since @xmath299 , from the above we have that @xmath307 if @xmath308 and @xmath309 if @xmath310",
