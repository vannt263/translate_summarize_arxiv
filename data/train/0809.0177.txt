    "the nature of the stochastic processes describing these emerging macroscopic behaviors is a subject of a vivid debate in the physical literature and remarkably few mathematical results are present for deterministic microscopic models .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of the energy in a chain of harmonic oscillators with the hamiltonian dynamics perturbed by stochastic terms conserving energy and momentum has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the density of energy distribution over spatial and momentum variables , obtained there in a proper kinetic limit , satisfies _ a linear phonon boltzmann equation _",
    ", @xmath8 as we have already mentioned , @xmath9 is the density at time @xmath10 of energy of waves of fourier s mode @xmath11 $ ] , and the velocity @xmath12 is the derivative of the dispersion relation of the lattice .",
    "we remark at this point that ( [ eq : boltz ] ) appears also as a limit of scaled wave , or schrdinger equations in a random medium with fast oscillating coefficients and initial data .",
    "it is sometimes called , in that context , _ the radiative transport equation _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite , or monography @xcite for more details on this subject ) .    since the kernel @xmath13 appearing in ( [ eq : boltz ] ) is positive , this equation has an easy probabilistic interpretation as a forward equation for the evolution of the density of a markov process @xmath14 on @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "in fact , here @xmath16 is an autonomous jump process on @xmath17 $ ] with jump rate @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is an additive functional of @xmath16 .",
    "momentum conservation in the microscopic model imposes a very slow jump rate for small @xmath19 : @xmath20 as @xmath21 , while velocity @xmath12 remains of order 1 even for small @xmath19 .",
    "so when @xmath16 has a small value , it may stay unchanged for a long time , as does the velocity of @xmath22 .",
    "this is the mechanism that generates on a macroscopic scale the superdiffusive behavior of @xmath22 .",
    "the above example has motivated us to study the following general question .",
    "consider a markov chain @xmath23 taking values in a general polish metric space @xmath24d@xmath25 .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a stationary and ergodic probability borel measure for this chain .",
    "consider a function @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath2 is centered with respect to @xmath1 , and possesses a second moment , one expects that the central limit theorem holds for @xmath28 , as @xmath29 .",
    "this , of course , requires some assumptions about the rate of the decay of correlations of the chain , as well as hypotheses about its dynamics .",
    "if @xmath2 has an infinite second moment and its tails satisfy a power law , then one expects , again under some assumption on the transition probabilities , convergence of the laws of @xmath30 , for an appropriate @xmath3 to the corresponding stable law .    in 1937 w. doeblin himself looked at this natural question in his seminal article  @xcite . in the final lines of this paper",
    ", he observes that the method of dividing the sum into independent blocks , used in the paper to show the central limit theorem for countable markov chains , can be used also in the infinite variance situation",
    ". a  more complete proof , along the line of doeblin s idea , can be found in an early paper of nagaev @xcite , assuming a strong _ doeblin _ condition .",
    "starting from the early sixties , another , more analytical approach , has been developed for proving central limit theorems for markov chains , based on a martingale approximation of the additive functional . by solving ( or by approximating the solution of ) the poisson equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transition probability matrix",
    ", one can decompose the sum @xmath33 into a martingale plus a negligible term , thus reducing the problem to a central limit theorem for martingales .",
    "this is exploited by gordin ( see @xcite ) when @xmath32 has a spectral gap . in the following decades",
    ", much progress has been achieved using this approach .",
    "it has found applications in stochastic homogenization , random walks in random environments and interacting particle systems ( i.e. , infinite - dimensional problems , where renewal arguments can not be applied ) , culminating in the seminal paper of kipnis and varadhan @xcite where reversibility of the chain is exploited in an optimal way ( see also @xcite ) . for nonreversible chains",
    "there are still open problems ( see @xcite and the review paper @xcite for a more detailed list ) .",
    "as far as we know , the martingale approximation approach has not been developed in the case of convergence to stable laws of functionals of markov chains , even though corresponding theorems of martingale convergence have been available for a while ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present article is a first step in this direction .",
    "more precisely , we are concerned with the limiting behavior of functionals formed over functions @xmath2 with heavy tails that satisfy a power law decay , that is , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 with @xmath4 .",
    "we prove sufficient conditions under which the laws of the functionals of the form @xmath30 converge weakly to @xmath3-stable laws , as @xmath29 .",
    "theorem [ stable - discrete-1 ] is proven by martingale approximation , under a spectral gap condition .",
    "we also give a proof by a more _ classical _ renewal method based on a coupling technique inspired by @xcite . the coupling argument",
    "gives a simpler proof but under more restrictive assumptions on the form of the probability transition ( cf .",
    "condition [ doeblin ] ) .",
    "we point out , however , that such hypotheses are of local nature , in the sense that they involve only the behavior of the process around the singularity . in particular , the spectral gap condition ( which is a global condition )",
    "can be relaxed in this coupling approach , to a moment bound for some regeneration times associated to the process ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm - coupl ] ) .",
    "next , we apply these results to a continuous time markov jump process @xmath37 whose skeleton chain satisfies the assumptions made in the respective parts of theorem [ stable - discrete-1 ] . we prove that if the mean waiting time @xmath38 has a finite moment with respect to the invariant measure @xmath1 and the tails of @xmath39 obey the power laws , as above , then finite - dimensional distributions of the scaled functional of the form @xmath40 converge to the respective finite - dimensional distribution of a stable process ( see theorem [ thm - main-3 ] ) .",
    "finally , these results are applied to deal with the limiting behavior of the solution @xmath9 of the linear boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltz ] ) in the spatial dimension @xmath41 .",
    "we prove that the long - time , large - scale limit of solutions of such an equation converges to the solution of the fractional heat equation @xmath42 corresponding to a stable process with exponent @xmath43 . both approaches ( i.e. , martingale approximation and coupling ) apply to this example .",
    "_ note added to the second version _ : after completing the first version of the present paper @xcite , we have received a preprint by mellet , mischler and mouhot @xcite that contains a completely analytical proof of the convergence of the solution of a linear boltzmann equation to a fractional diffusion .",
    "the conditions assumed in @xcite imply the same spectral gap condition as in our theorem [ stable - discrete-1 ] ; consequently the corresponding result in @xcite is related to our theorem [ thm - main-3 ] .",
