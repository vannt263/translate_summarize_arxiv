    "the goal of the present article is to provide a mathematically sound definition of the standard feynman path integral representation of the unitary evolution operator @xmath0 in the quantum mechanics which is generated by a hamiltonian @xmath1=@xmath1 * with a potential .",
    "that is , the distribution kernel of @xmath0 is expressed in terms of a path integral weighted with exp[@xmath2(@xmath3(@xmath4 ) ) ] , where @xmath5 is the classical action corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "although this is an old subject , we recommend to look , for example , at the references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each of them represents a distinct line of thought about the field .",
    "the first reference , in particular , gives a complete list of references .",
    "while an analogous idea leading to path integral representations , called feynman - kac formulas , of the corresponding semi - group @xmath6 is firmly anchored in the theory of stochastic processes , the construction of the above feynman path integral for @xmath0 as an oscillatory integral is notoriously difficult .",
    "there are various no - go theorems limiting the possibilities to begin with .",
    "these mathematical difficulties are largely ignored by the theoretical physics community .",
    "for instance , the quantization of field theories , notably gauge theories , is entirely based on the feynman path integral , as a formal procedure , despite its lacking of mathematical foundation .",
    "so , for these reasons , mathematical progress towards the construction of the feynman path integral , even if very small , deserves appreciation .",
    "we will present the mathematical difficulties and the current developments of the feynman path integral .",
    "the feynman path integral is known to be a powerful tool in different domains of physics . at the same time , the mathematical theory underlying lots of ( often formal ) physical calculations is far from being complete .",
    "various known approaches to the rigorous construction of the feynman path integral representation to the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath7 ( and its generalizations that include magnetic fields ) can be roughly divided into three classes . in the approaches of the first class ,",
    "the feynman integral is not supposed to be a genuine integral , but is specified as some generalized functional on an appropriate space of functions , which can be defined , for example , as the limit of certain discrete approximations ( see e.g. @xcite and more recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , by means of analytical continuation ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , by extensions of perceval s identity and by related axiomatic definitions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) or by means of the white noise analysis ( see @xcite ) , see also @xcite for the discussion of path integral applied to the dirac equation .",
    "these approaches still cover only a very restrictive class of potentials , for example , singular potentials were considered only by white noise analysis approach but only in one - dimensional case ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in the approaches of the second class ,",
    "one tries to define the infinite dimensional feynman integral as a genuine integral over a bona fide @xmath8-additive measure on an appropriate space of trajectories .",
    "the first attempt made in @xcite to construct such a measure was erroneous and led to understanding that there is no direct generalization of wiener measure that can give an analog of feynman - kac formula for the case of schrdinger operators . a correct construction of the feynman integral in terms of the wiener measure was proposed in @xcite and was based on the idea of the rotation of the classical trajectories in complex domains .",
    "namely , changing the variables @xmath3 to @xmath9 = @xmath10 in equation ( [ 1 ] ) leads to the equation @xmath11 which is of diffusion type ( with possibly complex source ) and can be treated by means of the feynman - kac formula and the wiener measure .",
    "clearly this works only under very restrictive analytic assumptions on @xmath12 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if one is interested only in semi classical approximations to the solutions of the schrdinger equation one can obtain along these lines an approximate path integral representation for even non - analytic potentials that yields all terms of semi classical expansion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another approach to the construction of the genuine path integral initiated in @xcite , @xcite defines it as an expectation with respect to a certain compound poisson process , or as an integral over a measure concentrated on piecewise constant paths , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "though this method was successfully applied to different models ( see e.g. @xcite for many particle problems , @xcite for simple quantum field models , @xcite for computational aspects and tunneling problems , @xcite and @xcite for dirac equations ) , the restrictions on interaction forces were always very strong , for example , for a usual schrdinger equation , this approach was used only in the case of potentials which are fourier transforms of finite measures .",
    "however in @xcite , @xcite following this trend , a construction was given that covered already essentially more general potentials . to achieve this ,",
    "one uses a coordinate representation for the schrdinger equation ( and not the momentum representation as in @xcite ) and also uses an appropriate regularization of the schrdinger equation .",
    "a more physically motivated regularization to ( [ 1 ] ) ( but also technically more difficult to work with ) can be obtained from the theory of continuous quantum measurement ( see @xcite , @xcite for the corresponding results ) .    in the original papers of feynman",
    "the path integral was defined ( heuristically ) in such a way that the solutions to the schrdinger equation were expressed as the integrals of the function exp@xmath13 , where @xmath5 is the classical action along the paths .",
    "it seems that rigorously the corresponding measure was not constructed even for the case of the heat equation with sources ( notice that in the famous feynman - kac formula that gives rigorous path integral representation for the solutions to the heat equation a part of the action is actually hidden \" inside the wiener measure ) .    in this article",
    "we give a possible definition of the feynman integral which is related to the first class of approaches above .",
    "the mathematically detailed exposition of the result and its proof starts in section [ seccion 2 ] , called _ algebraic exposition _ in a very general and abstract way .",
    "there are explanations , motivations , and examples given in this section , of what the objects introduced are good for",
    ".    the reader should be willing to go on to sections [ seccion 3 ] and [ seccion 4 ] , which are called _ topological exposition _ and _ analytic exposition_. we define an integral of cylindrical functions  by means of multiple integrals with respect to finite measures .",
    "we define a topology on the space of configurations with which the defined integral has a continuous extension to the set of continuous functions on the space of paths .",
    "this extension has a unique representation as a regular and finite borel measure on the space of paths .",
    "in addition , the integral can be defined in terms of a measurable and nonnegative function on the time interval and the space of configurations .",
    "examples hint the reader of the eventual use of the definitions and theorems introduces up to this point .",
    "sections [ seccion 2 ] till [ seccion 4 ] apply to the main results presented in section [ subseccion 3.3 ] and section [ seccion 6 ] . in section [ subseccion 3.3 ] ,",
    "the wiener integral is being discussed as an example of this type of integral , and should convince the reader of the power of the notion of feynman path integral introduced in this paper .    in section [ seccion 5 ] , we consider the schrdinger equation for a free particle in a compact space .",
    "the fundamental solution of this equation is a distribution .",
    "we approximate this distribution by a sequence of smooth functions .",
    "we consider the sequence of complex measures corresponding to these functions , as in section [ seccion 3 ] .",
    "we define a class @xmath5 of test functions on the space of paths .",
    "the class of test functions used here is wide ( cf section [ seccion 5 ] ) , it contains a sufficiently rich space of functions and allows the existence of a feynman measure . for all test functions , the limit of the integrals of the function with respect to the complex measures exists .",
    "we define the feynman integral of a test function by this limit .",
    "in this section we consider four objects :    1 .",
