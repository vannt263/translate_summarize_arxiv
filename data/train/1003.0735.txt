    "the relay channel problem was first studied by van der meulen @xcite , where the source transmits a message to the destination with the help of a relay node . in @xcite",
    ", the authors formalized the problem and proposed several effective full - duplex relay strategies , which are the so - called decode - and - forward ( df ) and compress - and - forward ( cf ) schemes .",
    "subsequently , the corresponding schemes in the time division half - duplex ( tdd ) mode were studied in @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the capacity and various achievable rates were established in @xcite and @xcite , while the general capacity problem is still open .",
    "one of the important applications of relaying is in low - power communication networks ( such as wireless sensor networks ) , where the transmitting snrs are usually low such that relays are needed to enhance the performance at the destination nodes . in @xcite ,",
    "the author presented two important performance criteria in the low - snr regime : one is the minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication ; and the other is the slope of the spectral efficiency .",
    "such criteria have been adopted to study the relay channel in the low - snr regime  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the time - sharing cf scheme and the traditional df scheme were investigated in @xcite for both the full - duplex and frequency division half - duplex ( fdd ) modes , where the authors derived the df - based upper bound on the minimum energy per bit , and the lower bound using the max - flow min - cut capacity theorem . in @xcite , the fading relay channel was studied , where the upper and lower bounds on the minimum energy per bit were derived using the same method as in @xcite .    in the low - snr regime , the cf scheme is much more appealing than the df scheme since the relay can not decode much information such that the df strategy at the relay would cause the bottleneck effect . in this paper , we thus focus on the time - sharing cf scheme in the low - snr regime under both the full - duplex and half - duplex tdd modes . we show that the time - sharing cf scheme improves the achievable rate under the tdd mode when the snr is low .",
    "furthermore , the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit is derived by applying the max - flow min - cut theorem for the channel capacity , and the upper bound is derived by deploying the time - sharing cf scheme .",
    "the aforementioned upper bound can be further tightened by letting the active phase duration decrease to zero at the same rate as the snr value .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the channel model is discussed in section [ sec_2 ] . in section [ sec_3 ]",
    "we present the achievable rates of the time - sharing cf scheme under both the full - duplex and half - duplex tdd modes , and subsequently we derive the bounds on the minimum energy per bit for reliable communication .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ sec_4 ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec_5 ] .",
    "consider the gaussian relay channel as shown in fig . [ fig_relay_channel_model ] , where the channel amplitude gains are assumed fixed and denoted as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "next , we introduce the signal models for both the traditional relaying schemes ( full - duplex and half - duplex tdd ) , and the time - sharing relaying scheme . note that in this paper we only consider real signals since the extension to complex cases is straightforward .",
    "suppose the relay can transmit and receive signals at the same time .",
    "the channel inputs at the source and relay are represented as @xmath3 and @xmath4 with average power values @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the noises at the relay and destination are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are independent additive white gaussian noises ( awgns ) with distributions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    denoting the received signals at the relay and destination by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively",
    ", we can fully describe the channel as : @xmath13      we also consider the half - duplex tdd mode , where at each transmission slot the relay listens to the source during the first @xmath14 fraction of time , and transmits to the destination in the remaining @xmath15 fraction .    in the first @xmath14 fraction",
    ", the transmitted signal at the source is denoted by @xmath16 with an average power constraint @xmath17 .",
    "the received signals at the relay and destination are given by : @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent awgns .    in the remaining @xmath15",
    "fraction , the transmitted signals at the source and relay are denoted as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with average power constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the received signal at the destination is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the awgn noise at the destination .",
    "it is known that for low - snr point - to - point gaussian channels , low - duty - cycle on - off keying is as good as gaussian inputs  @xcite . along a similar line , for the low - snr relay channels",
    ", the authors in  @xcite proposed a time - sharing cf scheme based on the argument that the cf achievable rate is not a concave function over the power allocation factor , where the underlying idea is that the relay can  hear \" the source more clearly if we first deploy a silent phase in each slot and increase the peak power in the following active phase .    with the above discussions , in this paper we consider the time - sharing relaying scheme , where in each time slot all the nodes",
    "keep silent in the first @xmath27 fraction ( called the silent phase ) , and deploy the traditional relaying scheme in the remaining @xmath28 fraction ( called the active phase ) , which could be either full - duplex or half - duplex as introduced in the previous subsection .",
    "as such , the signal model in the active phase follows the previously introduced model except that the power at the source and relay should be scaled up accordingly to meet the average power constraint .",
    "for example , if full - duplex relaying is deployed , the power values at the source and relay become @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "in this section , the performance of the time - sharing cf scheme is investigated under both the full - duplex and half - duplex tdd modes .",
    "specifically , we derive the achievable rates and the upper / lower bounds on the minimum energy per bit in the low - snr regime . for convenience ,",
    "we define the following function : @xmath31 and denote the _ normalized channel gains _ of the corresponding links as : @xmath32        we first give the upper bound on the capacity by applying the max - flow min - cut theorem @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the correlation coefficient between the source and relay inputs , and @xmath35    now we first consider the traditional cf strategy , where the relay compresses the received signal with wyner - ziv coding  @xcite , and then forwards the binning index to the destination .",
    "the following achievable rate is established with the cf scheme @xcite : @xmath36 subject to the constraint @xmath37 correspondingly , the achievable rate with cf over the gaussian relay channel can be written as : @xmath38 as we discussed before , to improve the performance in the low - snr regime , the authors in  @xcite proposed the time - sharing cf scheme based on the argument that the achievable rate is not a concave function of the power . specifically , the relay channel is only utilized for @xmath28 portion of each time slot . in this @xmath28 portion ,",
    "the power values of the source and relay are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the achievable rate for the time - sharing cf scheme is given as  @xcite : @xmath39 it is also shown in @xcite that the above achievable rate is higher than the one with the traditional cf scheme @xcite in the low - snr regime .",
    "in practice , full - duplex relaying is technically difficult to implement .",
    "hence , we now consider the more practical tdd mode .",
    "we first give the max - flow min - cut bound on the capacity @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath34 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath41 and @xmath4 , and @xmath42    furthermore , the traditional cf achievable rate without time - sharing under the half - duplex tdd mode is given by @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the power of the quantization noise at the relay , with @xmath45    in the tdd mode , the above achievable rate function is not a concave function of the power either .",
    "thus , by a similar argument as that in @xcite , we can apply time - sharing in the low - snr regime to improve the achievable rate .",
    "in particular , the source and relay keep silent in the first @xmath27 portion of each time slot ; then the source sends the message to the relay and destination in the following @xmath46 portion with power @xmath47 .",
    "the relay compresses the received signal and sends it to the destination over the last @xmath48 fraction of time with power @xmath30 .",
    "the source also utilizes the last @xmath48 portion to send signal to the destination with power @xmath49 .",
    "the achievable rate of the above time - sharing cf scheme under the half - duplex tdd mode can be computed as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the power of the quantization noise at the relay , with @xmath52    the achievable rate improvement in the low - snr regime under both the full - duplex and half - duplex modes will be further illustrated in section [ sec_4 ] , by numerical comparisons against the schemes without time - sharing .      in @xcite ,",
    "the author presented two important performance criteria in the low - snr regime : one is the minimum energy per bit required for reliable communication , and the other is the slope of the spectral efficiency . in this paper , we focus on the first criterion . denoting the channel capacity as @xmath53 with @xmath54 the total power consumed at the source and the relay , the minimum energy per bit is defined as  @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the first - order derivative at @xmath57 .",
    "note that here the energy per bit is referring to the total energy consumed at both the source and the relay for each bit transmitted over the relay channel .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we derive the upper and lower bounds on the minimum energy per bit under both the full - duplex and half - duplex modes for the gaussian relay channel under consideration .",
    "we skip the derivation of the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit under the full - duplex mode , which is obtained by applying the max - flow min - cut upper bound on the channel capacity .",
    "interested readers can refer to @xcite and @xcite for related results .",
    "now we derive the upper bound on the minimum energy per bit .",
    "assume that the sum power across the source and the relay is subject to a total power constraint @xmath54 .",
    "denote the power at the source as @xmath58 and the power at the relay as @xmath59 for @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "the achievable rate of the time - sharing cf scheme can be calculated as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . for a given active fraction @xmath28",
    ", the upper bound on the minimum energy per bit can be evaluated as : @xmath64 to determine the limit , now we discuss several interesting cases based on the behavior of the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "when the power @xmath54 decreases to @xmath65 , while @xmath28 keeps constant or does not scale down as fast as @xmath54 , the upper bound on the minimum energy per bit in is equal to @xmath66 , which is minimized at @xmath67 . in this case , the power is all utilized by the source , and the upper bound on the minimum energy per bit is the same as that of the point - to - point communication channel .",
    "the above result also implies that such an upper bound corresponding to the traditional cf scheme with a fixed @xmath68 is equal to @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , if the active fraction @xmath28 goes to @xmath65 faster than @xmath54 , @xmath70 in goes to infinity , which leads to a non - meaningful upper bound on the minimum energy per bit .",
    "however , if we keep the ratio @xmath71 constant ( denoted by @xmath72 ) when @xmath54 and @xmath28 decrease to zero , we could achieve a tighter upper bound ( against the case of @xmath68 ) on the minimum energy per bit .",
    "therefore , we have the following theorem describing the asymptotic upper bound on the minimum energy per bit using the time - sharing cf scheme .    under the full - duplex mode ,",
    "when both @xmath54 and @xmath28 tend to zero with @xmath73 , the minimum energy per bit on the relay channel has the following asymptotic upper bound : @xmath74    it can be shown that under the full - duplex mode , the above upper bound converges to the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit when @xmath75  @xcite since both the upper and lower bounds go to @xmath76 .",
    "the upper bound improvement of the minimum energy per bit due to time - sharing will be further illustrated in section [ sec_4 ] by numerical comparisons in the low - snr regime .",
    "here we investigate the lower and upper bounds on the minimum energy per bit under the half - duplex mode .",
    "the sum of the source power and the relay power is fixed to @xmath54 as in the full - duplex mode .",
    "denote the power at the source as @xmath58 and the power at the relay as @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , with cf we assume that the source uses the same power during the first and the second transmitting phases , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , we have the power allocation as @xmath78 .",
    "first we derive the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit , which is given by the following theorem .    under the half - duplex tdd mode , the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit",
    "can be obtained by one - dimensional searching over @xmath79 $ ] instead of three - dimensional searching over @xmath14 , @xmath80 , and @xmath34 .",
    "when the relay - destination link gain @xmath81 goes to infinity , the lower bound converges to @xmath76 .    see appendix [ appendix_1 ] .",
    "now we consider the upper bound on the minimum energy per bit , which is achieved by the time - sharing cf scheme .    under the half - duplex mode ,",
    "the minimum energy per bit on the relay channel is upper - bounded by : @xmath82 such an upper bound is tight ( i.e. , achieves the lower bound on the minimum energy per bit ) asymptotically when @xmath81 goes to infinity .",
    "as shown in , the achievable rate of the time - sharing cf scheme under the half - duplex mode is computed as : @xmath83 where the quantization noise power @xmath51 is @xmath52 subsequently , we can have an upper bound by using the definition of the minimum energy per bit .",
    "then as in the full - duplex mode , the above upper bound can be tightened to achieve that in by letting @xmath28 decrease to @xmath65 at the same rate as @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the upper bound in converges to @xmath76 when @xmath75 , which implies that the upper bound is asymptotically optimal .    the comparisons between the time - sharing cf upper bound and the lower bound under both the full - duplex and half - duplex modes are shown in section [ sec_4 ] . note that the minimum energy per bit can be clearly improved by time - sharing ; hence we do not need to check the second performance measure : the relative spectral efficiency  @xcite , which is related to the second - order derivative of the achievable rate .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the performance improvement due to time - sharing in cf with several numerical results .",
    "the achievable rate and the minimum energy bit are evaluated under both the full - duplex and half - duplex modes .",

    "the distance between the source and the relay is @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , and the distance between the source and the destination is @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig_half_rate ] we show that the time - sharing cf scheme improves the achievable rate up to @xmath97 when @xmath95 , up to @xmath98 when @xmath96 , and up to @xmath99 when @xmath100 . unlike the full - duplex mode , the relative improvement decreases if @xmath85 is larger than @xmath101 .",

    "we can also see that the upper and lower bounds meet under both the full - duplex and half - duplex modes when @xmath85 goes to @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "we investigated the performance of the time - sharing cf scheme in the low - snr regime over gaussian relay channels . the achievable rates and the minimum energy per bit",
