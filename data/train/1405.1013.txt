    "molecular clouds exhibit a hierarchical density structure with stars forming in the densest regions .",
    "often , these star - forming complexes have an elongated , filamentary shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , recent observations by the _ herschel _ space observatory show that parsec - scale filaments are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the filaments tend to extend out from dense star - forming hubs @xcite and , sometimes , these hub - filaments structures are part of a larger - scale pattern with parallel filaments @xcite .",
    "the filaments exhibit a nearly universal width of @xmath1 pc ( measured by fwhm of the column density ) , independent of the central column density or length of the filament @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the radial - dependence of the column density profile is flatter than expected for an isothermal cylindrical filament in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a number of explanations have been suggested for the observed density profiles : the filaments correspond to stagnant gas in locally colliding flows @xcite , they are isothermal equilibrium cylinders in pressure - balance with the external medium ( i.e. a radially - truncated cylinder in hydrostatic equilibrium ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or are supported by magnetic fields @xcite .    thus , the origin of the filamentary cloud structure still remains unclear and heavily debated .",
    "the clouds can be formed by compressive motions of gravitational and/or turbulent nature @xcite .",
    "indeed , many numerical simulations produce filamentary structures by either isothermal driven turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thermal instability in large - scale convergent flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of the observational evidence points to a turbulent formation process for filaments and dense cores in the ism .",
    "however , observations often show cores within clouds with linewidths that require little additional support beyond thermal pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these quiescent cores are adequately modelled by bonnor - ebert spheres confining the cores by self - gravity and external pressure @xcite .",
    "such objects show that gravity plays a more prominent role than assumed in the turbulent models .",
    "magnetic fields are also important in the formation of the filaments .",
    "studies comparing the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the diffuse gas provide more insight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "optical polarization measurements of the taurus molecular cloud show that the magnetic field in the diffuse gas is orientated perpendicular to the axis of the b216 and b217 filaments @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the filaments form as gas streams along the magnetic field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the long axis of the l1506 filament in taurus and of the @xmath2 ophiuchus clouds lies along the magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the role of self - gravity and magnetic fields on the formation of filaments and cores within self - gravitating layers .",
    "we neglect the effect of turbulent motions ( other than produced by gravitational and magnetic instabilities ) .",
    "self - gravitating isothermal layers are unstable to perturbations if the exciting modes are of sufficiently long wavelength @xcite and they fragment into clumps or thin filaments @xcite .",
    "when the layers are threaded by magnetic fields , fragmentation still occurs . using a linear perturbation analysis , @xcite",
    "show that , for a layer with a thickness larger than the pressure scale height , the magnetic field suppresses the growth of perturbations perpendicular to the field .",
    "perturbations along the field are unaffected so that parallel filaments form within the slab . on the other hand , for a layer with a thickness smaller than the scale height , filaments form with their axis orientated along the magnetic field .",
    "the separation of the filaments is given by the wavelength of the fastest growing mode .",

    "for our initial conditions we assume a self - gravitating isothermal layer that extends to infinity along the @xmath3-plane .",
    "the layer is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium , so that the density distribution along the @xmath4-axis is given by @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 the pressure scale height , @xmath7 the isothermal sound speed , @xmath8 the gravitational constant and @xmath9 the unperturbed density at the midplane ( i.e. at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the layer is truncated at @xmath11 and confined by a constant external thermal gas pressure @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we will not study the effect of the external pressure on fragmentation .",
    "therefore , we only consider a layer bounded by a low external pressure , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "we adopt @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 .    outside the layer ,",
    "not only the pressure , but also the density , @xmath16 , is kept constant at a small fraction of the density at the boundary ( see later for exact value ) .",
    "this means that the external temperature differs from the internal temperature .",
    "we , therefore , modify the isothermal equation of state to be @xmath17 this reflects the difference in external and internal temperature with @xmath18 a scalar that is 1 inside the layer and 0 outside .",
    "the layer and the external medium are threaded by a uniform magnetic field .",
    "for parallel models the magnetic field is along the @xmath19-axis , while , for perpendicular models , it is along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the field strength is given by @xmath20 at the midplane with @xmath21 the magnetic pressure .",
    "for our models we use @xmath22 . for simplicity , our simulations are performed dimensionless .",
    "we adopt @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 so that @xmath26 and the dynamical time @xmath27 . the free - fall time associated with gas at the midplane",
    "is @xmath28 . for a layer with a central density of @xmath29 ( and thus a surface density of @xmath30 ) and a temperature of 10  k",
    ", these values correspond to @xmath31  pc , @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) and @xmath34  myr . in the rest of the paper we will evaluate the dimensionless results in terms of this layer .",
    "this set - up is similar to the one used in the linear analysis of @xcite allowing a comparison between analytically and numerically derived growth rates of the gravitational instability . to study the gravitational instability of a pressure - confined self - gravitating layer , we perturb the equilibrium state .",
    "we do this in two different ways , i.e. we superimpose the density either with a sinusoidal density perturbation of a given wavelength or with randomly generated noise .",
    "the former is used to determine the growth rates to compare with analytic values , while the latter shows how different wave modes interact with each other . from the linear analysis @xcite suggest that first the filaments form and only then the dense cores .      to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations we use the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) mhd code mg @xcite .",
    "the basic algorithm is a second - order godunov scheme with a linear riemann solver @xcite . to ensure that the solenoidal constraint is met , a divergence cleaning algorithm is implemented in the numerical scheme @xcite .",
    "a hierarchy of grids levels is used with a mesh spacing on grid level @xmath35 of @xmath36 with @xmath37 the cell size at the coarsest level .",
    "while the two coarsest levels cover the entire domain , finer levels generally do not .",
    "refinement is on a cell - by - cell basis and is controlled by error estimates based on the difference between solutions on different grid levels .",
    "self - gravity is computed using a full approximation multigrid to solve the poisson equation .",
    "the numerical domain is given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is either @xmath41 .",
    "here , @xmath42 is the critical wavelength below which the gravitational instability is suppressed and @xmath43 the wavelength for which the growth rate is maximal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our adopted values , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as the layer is assumed to be infinite , we set the boundary condition on both the @xmath19 and @xmath46-axis to periodic .",
    "for the @xmath4-axis we use free - flow boundary conditions .",
    "the resolution of the simulation is set by the vertical extent of the slab .",
    "it is necessary to properly resolve the pressure scale height @xmath47 in order to find a proper balance between pressure gradients and self - gravity .",
    "we resolve the scale height by at least 5 cells .",
    "therefore , we use an amr mesh with the coarse level having 4 grid cells along the axis with the shortest length ( along the @xmath3-axis for the runs up to @xmath48 and along the @xmath4-axis for @xmath49 ) and 128 cells along the @xmath4-axis for the finest grid level .",
    "this means that the number of additional grid levels varies with different models , i.e. from 2 extra grid levels for @xmath50 up to 5 grid levels for @xmath51 .",
    "this resolution is more than sufficient to resolve the jeans length as suggested by @xcite to avoid artificial fragmentation .",
    "in fact , artificial fragmentation is only expected above @xmath52 .",
    "as we are interested in the gravitational instability in the equilibrium layer , we need to ensure that the external medium does not affect the gravitational instability in the layer in any way . by assuming a constant pressure in the external medium",
    ", the external medium needs to be a vacuum .",
    "( the gravitational force is zero if there is no pressure force . ) however , in a grid code , we can not set the density to zero .",
    "for a non - zero external density , the self - gravity of the layer drags the external medium towards it . then the external medium affects the hydrostatic layer because gas is accreted onto the layer and because the ram pressure contributes to the total external pressure .",
    "we find that the external density needs to be at most @xmath53 not to affect the equilibrium layer .",
    "as the external pressure is @xmath54 , this means that the external sound speed is @xmath55 times larger than in the layer .",
    "this significantly limits the stable numerical time step derived from the courant condition @xmath56 .",
    "because of this constraint , we use a different approach , i.e. we artificially switch off the self - gravity in the external medium .",
    "this is easily done as the different media have a different value of the scalar @xmath18 .",
    "this intervention allows us to set the external medium density to @xmath57 without affecting the equilibrium layer and gives us a speed up of more than a factor of ten in computational time .",
    "in order to determine the effect of the magnetic field on the density distribution and geometry of the filaments , we first study the onset and evolution of the gravitational instability in the absence of a magnetic field .",

    "<S> we examine the role of the gravitational instability in an isothermal , self - gravitating layer threaded by magnetic fields on the formation of filaments and dense cores . using numerical simulation </S>",
    "<S> we follow the non - linear evolution of a perturbed equilibrium layer . </S>",
    "<S> the linear evolution of such a layer is described in the analytic work of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that filaments and dense cores form simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the initial magnetic field , the resulting filaments form either a spiderweb - like network ( for weak magnetic fields ) or a network of parallel filaments aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field lines ( for strong magnetic fields ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the filaments are radially collapsing , the density profile of their central region ( up to the thermal scale height ) can be approximated by a hydrodynamical equilibrium density structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the magnetic field does not play a significant role in setting the density distribution of the filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the density distribution outside of the central region deviates from the equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the radial column density distribution is then flatter than the expected power law of @xmath0 and similar to filament profiles observed with _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel_. our results does not explain the near constant filament width of @xmath1pc </S>",
    "<S> . however , our model does not include turbulent motions . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that accretion - driven amplification of these turbulent motions provides additional support within the filaments against gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we interpret the filamentary network of the massive star forming complex g14.225 - 0.506 in terms of the gravitational instability model and find that the properties of the complex are consistent with being formed out of an unstable layer threaded by a strong , parallel magnetic field . </S>"
