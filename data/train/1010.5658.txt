    "<S> in this paper we consider the _ degree / diameter problem _ , namely , given natural numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , find the maximum number @xmath2 of vertices in a graph of maximum degree @xmath3 and diameter @xmath4 . in this context , the moore bound @xmath5 represents an upper bound for @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> graphs of maximum degree @xmath3 , diameter @xmath4 and order @xmath5 , called _ moore graphs _ , turned out to be very rare . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is very interesting to investigate graphs of maximum degree @xmath0 , diameter @xmath1 and order @xmath6 with small @xmath7 , that is , @xmath8-graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath9 is called the _ </S>",
    "<S> defect_.    graphs of defect @xmath10 exist only for @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath12 , @xmath8-graphs represent a wide unexplored area . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focuses on graphs of defect @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> building on the approaches developed in @xcite we obtain several new important results on this family of graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we prove that the girth of a @xmath14-graph with @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> second , and most important , we prove the non - existence of @xmath14-graphs with even @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; this outcome , together with a proof on the non - existence of @xmath18-graphs ( also provided in the paper ) , allows us to complete the catalogue of @xmath19-graphs with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> such a catalogue is only the second census of @xmath14-graphs known at present , the first being the one of @xmath22-graphs with @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> other results of this paper include necessary conditions for the existence of @xmath14-graphs with odd @xmath23 and @xmath16 , and the non - existence of @xmath14-graphs with odd @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conjecture that there are no @xmath14-graphs with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and comment on some implications of our results for the upper bounds of @xmath2 .    </S>",
