    "neutron star x - ray transients spend the vast majority of their time in quiescence , in which they are dim with typical luminosities of @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , but occasionally show an immense x - ray brightening in which their luminosity can rise to levels of @xmath6  erg  s@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their quiescent x - ray spectra are observed to consist of one or two components ; a soft , thermal component ( @xmath7  kev ) , and/or a hard power - law tail ( dominating above 2 kev , photon index 1 - 2 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several explanations have been put forward to describe the quiescent emission of neutron star transients , such as low - level accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which spreads over the neutron star .",
    "the gained heat is radiated as thermal emission from the surface once the system returns to quiescence . in this interpretation",
    "the quiescent thermal emission depends on the time - averaged accretion rate of the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as on the neutrino emission mechanism that operates in the core , which regulates the cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    there exists a small group of quasi - persistent x - ray transients , which undergo prolonged accretion outbursts with a duration of years to decades rather than the usual weeks to months ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these systems ,",
    "the neutron star crust is substantially heated and becomes thermally decoupled from the core .",
    "once the outburst ends , the crust will cool down primarily through heat conduction towards the core , until eventually thermal equilibrium is re - established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the quiescent base level reflects the thermal state of the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "confronting the observed cooling curves with thermal evolution models suggests that the neutron stars in both ks  1731260 @xcite and mxb  165929 @xcite have a highly conductive crust .",
    "this idea is supported by theoretical plasma simulations of @xcite , who demonstrated that the accreted matter will arrange itself in a lattice structure with a high thermal conductivity .",
    "recently , the quasi - persistent neutron star x - ray transient exo  0748676 also started the transition to quiescence .",

    "prior to its discovery , exo  0748676 was serendipitously observed with _ einstein _ in may 1980 , from which @xcite deduced a @xmath120.2 kev blackbody source spectrum with a 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath13 .",

    "however , observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) obtained on 2008 august 12 signaled a decrease in 2 - 20 kev source flux down to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this decline was confirmed when _ swift _ observations with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) performed on 2008 september 28 found the source at a 0.5 - 10 kev flux of @xmath20 ( see table  [ tab : swift ] , @xmath21 ) .",

    "this suggests that the neutron star crust may thermally relax in the coming years , revealing a cooling curve as has been observed for ks  1731260 and mxb  165929 . the current data set",
    "can then provide an unique insight into the early stages of neutron star cooling , and can possibly put constraints on the amount of heating in the outer crustal layers @xcite .    however , the top and middle panel of figure  [ fig : temp ] suggest that the effective temperature and thermal bolometric flux of exo  0748676 have not decreased during the past three months ( see also table  [ tab : swift ] ) .",
    "the 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity remains approximately constant at @xmath111 , which is close to the value deduced from an _ einstein _ observation in 1980 ( see section  [ subsec : exo ] ) .",
    "there are several explanations that can account for the current high luminosity of exo  0748676 and are consistent with the _ einstein _ detection of exo  0748676 in 1980 .",
    "firstly , we can not exclude the possibility that we detect low - level accretion from exo  0748676 , since the resulting radiation spectrum may have a shape similar to that expected from crustal heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we made fast fourier transforms of the _ chandra _ data ( excluding the eclipses ) , but did not find any short - timescale ( @xmath112  sec ) variability that might indicate continued accretion @xcite .",
    "if the observed thermal emission is due to crustal heating , then the constant luminosity might imply that the crust and core have already reached thermal equillibrium .",
    "the neutron star in exo  0748676 would then be relatively hot compared to other quiescent systems ( see e.g. , figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "such a high quiescent luminosity can be explained by standard core cooling .",
    "since enhanced neutrino emission mechanisms are suppressed only when the density in the core is relatively low , this scenario would imply that the neutron star in exo  0748676 is not very massive and has not had enough time to accrete a significant amount of matter ( the exact mass limit for enabling enhanced core cooling mechanisms is model dependent )",
    ".    a high time - averaged mass - accretion rate can also give rise to a high quiescent luminosity .",
    "@xcite stated that between 1970 and 1980 no outburst reaching @xmath113 was observed for exo  0748676 using _ uhuru , ariel v _ and _ heao-1 _ , indicating that in the 10 yrs prior to the _",
    "detection the source was in quiescence ( at least , no similar long outburst as the most recent one occurred ; shorter outbursts of weeks or even months can not be excluded ) . besides this",
    ", we can not put any additional constraints on the duty cycle of exo  0748676 . normally , x - ray transients reside significantly longer in quiescence than in outburst , but for exo  0748676 the quiescence state might be similar in duration to the outburst episodes .",
    "the neutron star core temperature could then be maintained by repeated accretion episodes at a significantly higher level than would be the case if it would spend most of its time in quiescence .",
    "furthermore , a high quiescent luminosity can be accounted for if the neutron star crust has a low thermal conductivity , so that it will cool on a time scale of decades rather than a few years and remains hot for a long time @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this explanation is that there is no obvious reason why the neutron star in exo  0748676 would be so different in this respect from ks  1731260 and mxb  165929 , for which a low crust conductivity can be ruled out @xcite",
    ". this would also oppose independent molecular dynamics simulations that predict a regular crystal lattice structure @xcite .",
    "more _ chandra _ observations of exo  0748676 are scheduled for this year and these will provide insight into the different scenarios discussed above .",
