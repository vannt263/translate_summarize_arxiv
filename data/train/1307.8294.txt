    "discrete integrable systems play at present the key role in the whole integrability theory . according to kruskal @xcite : `` for years we have been thinking that the integrable evolution equations were the fundamental ones .",
    "it is becoming clear now that the fundamental objects are the integrable _ discrete _ equations . '' among discrete integrable systems the discrete kp equation proposed by hirota  @xcite takes a particular position .",
    "it was originally designated as a discrete version of the two dimensional toda system  @xcite , but it turned out @xcite that it has a profound relation with the whole kp hierarchy of integrable equations . moreover , under the name of @xmath4- or @xmath5-system it plays an important role in solvable lattice models of quantum physics and statistical mechanics  @xcite ; see also @xcite for a review of various properties of its classical version .",
    "recently , another impetus to study the hirota equation came from combinatorics @xcite , where it is known as the octahderon recurrence .",
    "already in works darboux  @xcite one can find a geometric meaning of two dimensional toda system as equations governing projective invariants of the so called laplace transformations of conjugate nets on surfaces .",
    "a transition of the geometric picture to a discrete level  @xcite produces again the hirota system , and leads to consideration of multidimensional lattices of planar quadrilaterals  @xcite , which are discrete analogs of multidimensional conjugate nets .",
    "quite recently , it turned out  @xcite that the theory of such quadrilateral lattices , where the underlying geometric constraint is coplanarity of four points , forms a part of the theory of desargues maps with the constraint being just collinearity of three points .",
    "such property looks rather trivial , but when the combinatorics of the points is prescribed  @xcite according to the structure of the @xmath6-type root lattice , it leads to the hirota system in its non - commutative version  @xcite , we remark that non - commutative ( matrix valued ) equations of hirota type appeared earlier in  @xcite .",
    "non - commutative integrable systems  @xcite can be considered as the second extreme point , the first being the systems with commuting dependent variables , with the quantum integrable systems in the middle .",
    "we will not consider here quantum integrability properties of the hirota equation , but we refer to above mentioned review  @xcite , the paper @xcite and our previous work  @xcite . for quantum systems related to quadrilateral lattice maps see  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "after presenting the desargues maps and their relation with the ( non - commutative ) hirota system and discrete kp hierarchy , we concentrate on connection of the above to theory of quadrilateral lattice maps . in partcular ,",
    "we offer a point of view on the discrete @xmath0-kp and @xmath1-kp equations from that perspective .",
    "then we study periodic reductions of the desargues maps which provide geometric meaning to the lattice gelfand  dikii systems .",
    "our approach makes clear the appearance of arbitrary functions of single variables in the systems and allows to introduce one more function related to non - isospectrality of the corresponding linear problems .",
    "finally , we conclude the reduction procedure by recovering known @xmath2-painleve equation of type @xmath3 .",
    "consider  @xcite the @xmath7-dimensional root lattice @xmath8 as generated by vectors along the edges of regular @xmath7-simplex in the @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space @xmath9 .",
    "the _ holes _ of the lattice are the points of the ambient space that are locally maximally distant from the lattice .",
    "the convex hull of the lattice points closest to a hole is called the delaunay polytope . among the delaunay polytopes of the root lattice @xmath8",
    "are the so called basic @xmath7-simplices , which are translates of the initial @xmath7-simplex .",
    "denote by @xmath10 , @xmath11-dimensional right projective space over a division ring @xmath12 .",

    "and we skip the argument @xmath25 , i.e. the linear system above reads @xmath26 .",
    "its compatibility condition @xmath27 is called the non - commutative hirota system @xcite .",
    "geometrically , equations describe the fact that vertices of any octahedron delunay polytope of the root lattice are mapped to the so called veblen configuration consisting of six points and four lines  each line is incident with three points , and each point is incident with two lines ( see figure  [ fig : desargues - map ] ) .",
    "this point of view was advocated in @xcite and motivated our definition of desargues maps .",
    "we remark that when @xmath12 is _ commutative _ (",
    "i.e. a field , and then we write @xmath28 instead of @xmath12 ) then the functions @xmath29 can be parametrized in terms of a single potential ( the tau - function ) @xmath30 @xmath31 and remaining equations reduce to the celebrated hirota system @xcite @xmath32 the presented above definition of desargues maps and the corresponding approach to the hirota system via the root lattices @xmath8 exhibits from the very beginning their invariance with respect to the affine weyl group @xmath33 which acts on the root lattice ( see  @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "we remark , that after suitable gauge transformation one can derive a non - autonomous version @xcite of the hirota system @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an arbitrary function of the variable @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "such a freedom in the hirota system will be used to obtain generic non - isospectral form of its quasi - periodic reduction .      to obtain the non - commutative analogue of the kadomtsev ",
    "petviashvilii ( kp ) hierarchy @xcite we distinguish the last coordinate @xmath38 , we put @xmath39 , and denote @xmath40 .",
    "if we define @xmath41 then the linear system gives the linear problem @xmath42 and the potentials @xmath43 satisfy the compatibility conditions @xmath44 in consequence we obtain the transformation rule @xmath45 which can be written as a non - commutative discrete kp map , see figure  [ fig:3d - gd - u ] , @xmath46 in recent studies on discrete integrable systems the property of multidimensional consistency @xcite is considered as the main concept of the theory .",
    "roughly speaking , it is the possibility of extending the number of independent variables of a given nonlinear system by adding its copies in different directions without creating this way inconsistency or multivaluedness . for desargues maps ( in notation of the kp hierarchy )",
    "such a problem can occur in construction of the point @xmath47 , which however ( by the desargues theorem @xcite ) is the _ single _ intersection point of three lines @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , see figure  [ fig : desargues - phi - k ] .",
    "we would like to stress that this geometric theorem is the source of the multidimensional consistency of other systems described in the paper .",
    "in particular , one can notice , that when we consider system in three independent variables , there are two ways to obtain @xmath51 starting from @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and using the map .",
    "[ prop-3d - u - kp ] the kp map is three dimensionally consistent .    to have to show that two expressions below are equal ( we assume that the indices @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 are distinct ) @xmath58_{(l ) } =    [ ( u_{i , k } - u_{j , k})^{-1 } u_{i , k } ( u_{i , k+1 } - u_{j , k+1 } ) ] _ { ( l ) } , \\qquad [ u_{i , k(l)}]_{(j ) } =    [ ( u_{i , k } - u_{l , k})^{-1 } u_{i , k } ( u_{i , k+1 } - u_{l , k+1 } ) ] _ { ( j ) } .\\ ] ] it is convenient to note first the following identity @xmath59 which can be verified directly using the kp  map  .",
    "the rest are simple algebraic manipulations using twice the above identity ( for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "we remark that because of infinite number of components of the fields @xmath62 the above three - dimensional consistency of the kp  map   is equivalent to ( local ) four - dimensional consistency of the non - commutative hirota system  .",
    "such a form is however convenient to demonstrate three - dimensional consistency of gelfand  dikii lattice equations .    the fields @xmath63 are attached to edges of the @xmath64 lattice .",
    "in @xcite we studied the vertex form of the equations .",
    "notice that the first part of equations allows to define potentials @xmath65 such that @xmath66 while the remaining part gives the map @xmath67 which allows to express the field in the fourth vertex of the elementary quadrilateral in terms of the fields in other three vertices .",
    "again , the value of @xmath68 in the eighth vertex of the combinatorial cube ( see figure  [ fig:3d - gd ] ) can be calculated from initial values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 in three different ways .",
    "it turns out that these three results are identical , i.e. the vertex kp map is multidimensionally consistent .",
    "in this section we recall @xcite the relation between desargues maps and the multidimensional lattices of planar quadrilaterals @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on describing the relation between the hirota system ( called also discrete @xmath6-kp system ) and its reductions to the discrete @xmath0-kp system ( the miwa system @xcite ) and the discrete @xmath1-kp system @xcite .",

    "these vectors satisfy the orthogonality relations @xmath81 and generate the @xmath82 sub - lattice ( with rescaled standard scalar product ) in the root lattice @xmath80 .",

    "the laplace transformations satisfy relations @xmath117 which express the root lattice @xmath118 domain of definition of the variable @xmath109 .",
