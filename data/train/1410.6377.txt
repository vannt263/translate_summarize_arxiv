    "in a recent paper , the theoretical equations for the magnetic pair distribution function ( mpdf ) were derived  @xcite .",
    "the mpdf , which can be obtained experimentally by properly normalizing and fourier transforming the magnetic scattering intensity from a neutron powder diffraction measurement in similar fashion to the atomic pdf  @xcite , is an intuitive function that reveals local magnetic correlations directly in real space .",
    "since the mpdf technique places diffuse and bragg scattering on an equal footing , it provides sensitivity to both short- and long - range magnetic order .",
    "the intuitive nature of the mpdf allows one to gain useful information about magnetic correlations by direct inspection of real - space mpdf patterns , which is often difficult when magnetic scattering is viewed only in reciprocal space .",
    "in addition , the mpdf can be calculated easily and quickly for a given magnetic structure , allowing for rapid quantitative refinement of magnetic structural models .    here",
    "we report the first experimental demonstration of the mpdf technique , which we use to investigate the magnetic ground state of mno .",
    "early neutron diffraction studies  @xcite showed that mno has the cubic rock - salt structure at high temperature and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition with a neel temperature of @xmath2  k. this magnetic transition is accompanied by a rhombohedral compression of the lattice along the [ 111 ] direction , resulting in 3 m  symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the spins of the mn@xmath3 ions lying within common ( 111 ) planes align ferromagnetically , with antiferromagnetic alignment between adjacent sheets along the [ 111 ] stacking direction resulting in the so - called type - ii antiferromagnetic structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig;mnospins ] ) .",
    "the spin alignment axis is known to lie within the ( 111 ) plane . however , for a structure in the 3 m symmetry space group , the absolute orientation of the spin within the plane can not be determined from powder diffraction measurements  @xcite .",
    "direction.,width=334 ]    paradoxically , it has been known for some time that the antiferromagnetic spin arrangement in mno is compatible only with monoclinic or lower symmetry  @xcite , so the true structural symmetry must be lower than 3 m . however , not even high - resolution neutron diffraction measurements revealed a deviation from 3 m  symmetry in the average structure  @xcite , which presents a conundrum .",
    "one possibility is that the local structure has the required monoclinic or lower symmetry , but averaging over differently ordered domains on longer length scales results in the higher symmetry average structure .",
    "neutron total scattering techniques can often provide sensitivity to these types of local distortions .",
    "the first total scattering study of mno  @xcite used the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) approach to investigate the nuclear and magnetic structure at various temperatures .",
    "the rmc algorithm is typically used to perform structural refinements in reciprocal space , in contrast to the real - space approach of pdf .",
    "descriptions of rmc modelling and examples of its application to atomic and magnetic structure can be found elsewhere  @xcite . in this first total - scattering study of mno",
    ", the low - temperature data were found to be consistent with the rhombohedral nuclear structure , although no specific attempts to investigate the possibility of local monoclinicity were reported . on the other hand",
    ", more recent rmc refinements did find evidence for a local monoclinic symmetry over a length scale of at least 20    @xcite , limited by the size of the rmc box .",
    "the rmc configurations projected into a monoclinic unit cell in which the atomic positions were displaced very slightly from their high - symmetry sites and a small out - of - plane spin component was found to vary sinusoidally along the pseudocubic [ 111 ] direction within the unit cell , resulting in a local @xmath4 symmetry . in this lower symmetry space group , it is possible , in principle , to measure the absolute spin orientation within the pseudocubic ( 111 ) plane even in the powder - averaged scattering pattern . exploiting this sensitivity , the rmc analysis found a very slight preference for the spin axis to lie along the pseudocubic @xmath5 directions .",
    "here we revisited this problem by measuring and analyzing the mpdf from mno at low temperature .",
    "this serves to assess the utility of this new approach , as well as to verify different aspects of the earlier studies .",
    "we find that a monoclinic model with the known type - ii antiferromagnetic ordering gives a better fit than the rhombohedral model to both the atomic and magnetic pdf data in the low-@xmath1 region , supporting the scenario of a local monoclinic distortion , though we find smaller atomic displacements than the earlier study @xcite .",
    "fitting the data in real space allowed us to investigate the @xmath1-dependence of the atomic and magnetic pdf fits over a wide range of @xmath1 , which revealed that the proposed local monoclinicity of the structure appears to weaken with increasing @xmath1 and crosses over to a rhombohedral structure on a length scale of @xmath6 10  nm .",
    "our analysis reveals a tendency for the spins to align along the pseudocubic @xmath7 $ ] directions , but does not provide evidence for the sinusoidal arrangement of canted spins . finally , we tested the ability of solving a magnetic structure from mpdf data by allowing unconstrained mpdf fits , where all the spins within the monoclinic unit cell were given random initial orientations and allowed to vary independently .",
    "this successfully recovered the expected antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "this work demonstrates the utility and intuitive power of the mpdf approach for studying magnetism in materials .",
    "to review , the mpdf for a system with a single spin - only magnetic species is given by  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the orientationally averaged magnetic scattering cross section  @xcite , the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to individual magnetic moments  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 separated by a distance  @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the spin quantum number in units of  @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the classical electron radius , @xmath20 is the neutron magnetic moment in units of nuclear magnetons , @xmath21 is the magnetic form factor , @xmath22 is the number of spins in the system , and  @xmath23 is the magnitude of the scattering vector .",
    "the coordinate system used to express  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 is locally defined for each spin pair such that @xmath26 lies along the vector joining the pair of spins ( pair axis ) and @xmath27 is chosen such that the @xmath28-plane contains the pair axis and the first spin , i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we have chosen to denote the mpdf as @xmath31 in accordance with the notation introduced by farrow and billinge  @xcite , where @xmath31 is the full fourier transform of the properly normalized intensity from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",

    "the second term is linear in @xmath1 with a slope that is dominated by the longitudinal correlations , again with a positive ( negative ) slope generally indicating ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) correlations  @xcite .",
    "although the mpdf was calculated for a number of magnetic structures in the previous work , an experimental verification has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "a large powder sample of mno ( 99% pure ) was obtained from a commerical supplier ( alfa aesar ) .",
    "we performed neutron scattering measurements on approximately 5  g of mno at 300  k and 5  k on beamline d20 at the institut laue - langevin ( ill ) using an incident wavelength of 0.94079   , resulting in a maximum momentum transfer of @xmath35  @xmath36 .",
    "the background signal from the vanadium sample can and cryostat was measured separately at each temperature and subtracted from the observed scattering patterns .",
    "the presence of long - range magnetic order was confirmed by the appearance of additional bragg peaks at low temperature arising from the antiferromagnetic spin structure .",
    "we also performed neutron time - of - flight total scattering measurements on the npdf instrument at the lujan neutron scattering center at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "these measurements were optimized for structural pdf refinement and accordingly benefitted from very low backgrounds and wide momentum - transfer coverage .",
    "standard corrections were applied to all data sets .",
    "the most direct method of obtaining the mpdf @xmath31 experimentally is to isolate the magnetic scattering intensity @xmath9 , normalize by dividing by the square of the magnetic form factor , and compute the fourier transform .",
    "the measured scattered intensity obtained from a typical experiment using unpolarized neutrons contains both the nuclear scattering @xmath37 as well as @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one must find an accurate means of separating the two contributions . in the following ,",
    "we describe two approaches we have taken to address this problem : first , we separate the nuclear and magnetic contributions in reciprocal space ; and second , we separate them in real space .      if the nuclear structure is known and well ordered , then a fit can be performed to the nuclear bragg peaks and subsequently they can be subtracted from the original scattering pattern",
    ". the remaining signal , which contains @xmath9 and any residual errors from the nuclear fit , can then be normalized and fourier transformed to obtain the mpdf .",
    "we applied this strategy to the 5  k scattering pattern measured at ill .",
    "we first subtracted the sample - environment background signal from the raw data and then used the rietveld refinement program fullprof  @xcite to fit the rhombohedral model to the nuclear bragg peaks , without refining any additional background contribution .",
    "we then subtracted the fitted nuclear profile and normalized the remaining signal by the square of the magnetic form factor , @xmath38 , to obtain the quantity that is fourier transformed in eq .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig;ill - panel - fitsub ] .",
    "finally , we numerically computed the fourier transform up to @xmath39  @xmath36 to obtain the experimental mpdf . throughout this work ,",
    "we use the analytic approximation for the mn@xmath3 magnetic form factor provided in the international tables  @xcite .     overlaid .",
    "( c ) experimental scattering pattern after normalization by @xmath40 .",
    "large errors are seen at high @xmath23 . , width=226 ]    it is clear that the preceding procedure resulted in significant interference from errors in the nuclear fit , particularly at high @xmath23 where the small value of @xmath21 amplifies the errors during the normalization step .",
    "we attempted to correct this by manually smoothing the magnetic scattering pattern to remove the most obvious errors after subtraction of the fitted nuclear scattering .",
    "we then normalized and fourier transformed the hand - corrected data in the same manner as before .",

    "however , this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "the difficulties of separating the nuclear and magnetic signals in reciprocal space motivated us to seek an improved means of obtaining reliable experimental mpdfs .",
    "using the total scattering data obtained on the npdf instrument , we developed an approach to obtain the mpdf simultaneously with the atomic pdf by fourier transforming both the nuclear and magnetic scattering together and separating their respective signals in real space .",
    "this opens the possibility for structural and magnetic pdf co - refinement .",
    "according to standard structural pdf protocols , for example as implemented by the software program pdfgetn  @xcite , the pdf is obtained from the total scattering intensity as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is shorthand for the fourier transform and includes a constant prefactor , @xmath45 is the total scattered intensity including the nuclear contribution @xmath37 and the magnetic contribution @xmath9 , @xmath46 is the number of atoms , and @xmath47 is the nuclear scattering length , with angled brackets denoting an average over all nuclei present in the sample . separating the nuclear and magnetic contributions yields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the atomic ( nuclear ) pdf and @xmath50 is a quantity that we will call the `` unnormalized mpdf , '' since it does not involve division by the magnetic form factor @xmath21 .",

    "[ eq;dr ] , an overall gaussian damping factor to represent the finite correlation length of the magnetic structure , and a gaussian broadening factor to represent thermal motion .",
    "we note that there are two distinct thermal effects that can broaden the mpdf : motion of the ionic sites on which the spins reside , and fluctuations of the relative orientations of the spins .",
    "the best practice would be to treat these two cases separately , extracting the appropriate distribution of pair distances from the atomic pdf analysis and then refining only the broadening contribution that arises from thermal motion of the spin orientations .",
    "however , as a first attempt we use a single gaussian broadening factor to account for both of these effects .",
    "the effects of the finite experimental values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 were modelled by convoluting the calculated mpdf with the termination function  @xcite @xmath69 , where @xmath70 represents the zeroth - order spherical bessel function .",
    "two types of mpdf fits were performed : a local search ( refinement ) in which a single global spin axis was refined and the overall antiferromagnetic structure was imposed as a constraint , and a global optimization ( structure solution ) in which the orientations of each of the 12 spins in the monoclinic unit cell were given random initial starting directions and allowed to vary independently .",
    "a typical fit over a range of 100    required a computation time on the order of seconds on a standard laptop for the constrained fits and minutes for the unconstrained fits , relatively fast compared to more computationally intensive methods such as rmc .",
    "finally , we implemented an iterative atomic / magnetic pdf fitting procedure as follows .",
    "after the initial atomic and magnetic refinements , we subtracted the calculated  from the original real - space data to isolate the structural contribution , refined the atomic pdf against this new data set , generated a new difference curve from this refined structural model , used this to refine the magnetic structure again , and so on .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , the preferred spin axis determined by these fits lies along [ 10@xmath0 to within one standard deviation .",
    "the unconstrained fits also allowed us to look for systematic out - of - plane canting of the spins . for nearly every refinement , most or all of the 12 spins in the unit cell possessed some small but nonzero out - of - plane component .",
    "the weighted average of the magnitude of the canting angle for all 50 subsampled refinements is @xmath99 .",
    "this is consistent with the level of out - of - plane canting presented in the previous rmc study , although our results do not provide convincing evidence of the reported sinusoidal variation of the out - of - plane component  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these results suggest that some form of non - collinearity of the magnetic moments may be present within the unit cell .",
    "finally , we utilized @xmath1-dependent atomic and magnetic pdf analysis to further investigate the relationship between the local monoclinic structure suggested by total scattering measurements and the average rhombohedral structure determined from high - resolution neutron diffraction .",
    "we performed atomic and magnetic pdf co - refinements over fitting ranges from 0 to 20   , 60   , and 100    for both the 3 m and @xmath4 models .",
    "the results of the @xmath1-dependent co - refinements are displayed in table  [ table : fits ] .",
    "c c c c c & 0 - 20  & 0 - 60  & 0 - 100  +    & @xmath87 ( % ) & 7.20 & 8.30 & 10.55 + & @xmath74 (  ) & 3.15025(5 ) & 3.14948(2 ) & 3.14922(2 ) + & @xmath75 (  ) & 7.5921(3 ) & 7.5915(1 ) & 7.5914(1 ) +    & @xmath87 ( % ) & 6.88 & 8.21 & 10.51 + & @xmath74 (  ) & 5.4708(9 ) & 5.4609(4 ) & 5.4588(6 ) + & @xmath47 (  ) & 3.1429(5 ) & 3.1460(4 ) & 3.1466(4 ) + & @xmath75 (  ) & 15.1808(1 ) & 15.1825(2 ) & 15.1827(1 ) + & @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) & 89.895(2 ) & 89.989(3 ) & 90.004(5 ) +    [ table : fits ]    the overall @xmath87 values are slightly lower for the monoclinic model over all fitting ranges , supporting the scenario that the structure is indeed monoclinic on length scales up to 100   .",
    "however , two observations suggest that the long - range average structure is actually approaching 3 m  symmetry . first , the advantage in @xmath87 of the @xmath4 model over 3 m decreases for the larger fitting ranges .",
    "second , we note that the @xmath4 structure is equivalent to the 3 m structure when the monoclinic angle @xmath76 is 90@xmath77 and the lattice parameter ratio @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "inspection of table  [ table : fits ] shows that the ratio @xmath100 is 1.7407(4 ) , 1.7358(3 ) , and 1.7348(3 ) for the 20   , 60   , and 100    fits , respectively , with @xmath76 also approaching 90@xmath77 for the higher fitting ranges .",
    "the pdf fits therefore suggest that the structure has monoclinic symmetry locally but tends toward rhombohedral symmetry on average .",
    "this may explain why only the rhombohedral structure has been reported in previous diffraction measurements , since they are sensitive only to the long - range , average structure and not the local structure .",
    "we suggest that misalignment of monoclinic domains on a length scale of approximately 100    results in this average rhombohedral structure .",
    "the fact that these relatively large monoclinic domains do not result in clear peak splittings in the diffraction pattern points to the small magnitude of this monoclinic distortion .",
    "we suspect that a crystallographic refinement using the monoclinic structure may yield a better fit than the rhombohedral model by more accurately capturing the broadening of the peaks due to the small monoclinic distortion .",
    "neutron scattering data have been collected and analyzed from mno as the first experimental application of the recently derived mpdf equations .",
    "a practical method is presented for performing simultaneous structural and magnetic pdf co - refinements using the unnormalized mpdf function .",
    "the results suggest the presence of local monoclinic symmetry in mno with a preferred spin alignment axis of [ 10@xmath0 .",
    "the method of co - refining structural and magnetic pdfs obtained from unpolarized neutrons appears to be a promising method for studies of magnetic materials .",
