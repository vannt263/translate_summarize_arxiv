    "<S> to predict the rates of the various processes a set of universal parton distribution functions is required . </S>",
    "<S> these quark and gluon distributions are usually given in a variable - flavour - number - scheme ( vfns ) in which the number of active quark flavours increases from @xmath0 to @xmath4 , and then to @xmath5 , as @xmath6 increases above about @xmath7 , and then above about @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is the magnitude of the square of the momentum transfer in the process .    </S>",
    "<S> however there are practical reasons for also generating a set of up - to - date partons in the fixed three - light - flavour ( @xmath0 ) and fixed four - light - flavour ( @xmath4 ) schemes . for many exclusive or semi - inclusive processes the theoretical predictions for the hard scattering cross sections are , as yet , only available in the fixed - flavour - number - scheme ( ffns ) where all the heavy flavours are produced in the hard cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> thus fixed - flavour partons are needed in existing monte carlos , see , for example , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , despite the availability of a number of general mass variable - flavour number schemes , extractions of partons from fits to structure function data are often performed using a ffns , so it is useful to have available an up - to - date parton set in order to make consistent comparisons and to judge the real differences between alternative parton sets obtained using the same theoretical framework .    here </S>",
    "<S> we generate a set of ffns partons by evolving up in @xmath6 from a set of partons at the input scale , @xmath9 , obtained in a vfns global analysis of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution differs from that used in the vfns fit to the data in that    * we never turn on the heavy flavour @xmath10 contributions , * we set @xmath0 in the splitting and coefficient functions , * we keep @xmath0 in the coupling @xmath11 .    with respect to the last point , we usually define the coupling via the @xmath4 definition of @xmath12 ; for example for the ( @xmath13 , nlo ) mrst2004 set of partons @xcite we have @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we can convert this to a @xmath0 definition of @xmath12 using the nlo relation @xcite ^(3 )  =  ^(4 )  ( ) ^ ^. this relationship guarantees that the two couplings @xmath15 are identical below @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> . however the three - flavour coupling runs more quickly above the charm quark transition point , and hence becomes smaller . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the speed of evolution increases further at the bottom transition point , and the three - flavour coupling has a value @xmath16 compared to the value @xmath17 obtained in the vfns fit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behaviour is found for the cteq5 ffns partons @xcite , where , there , the three - flavour coupling has a value @xmath18 compared to the value @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at high @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are significantly different quantities . </S>",
    "<S> forcing @xmath20 to take the value @xmath22 would result in an enhanced coupling for @xmath23 , which would be inappropriate for describing data at these scales .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that it is important to do the ff evolution consistently . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the determination of ffns partons is very frequently done incorrectly , with a `` variable - flavour '' strong coupling , @xmath15 , used along with coefficient and splitting functions renormalized in a @xmath0 ffns . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this inconsistency between the renormalization scheme used for the coefficient functions and for the coupling was apparent in the original calculation @xcite of the ffns coefficient functions for deep inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the authors were fully aware of this discrepancy , but used both a vfns coupling and vfns partons since only vfns partons were then available and because the error induced was small compared with other uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> it is no longer the case that the error made from the wrong choice of coupling is so unimportant .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    an illustration of the effect of such an inconsistency on a physical quantity is provided by the evolution of @xmath24 . at leading order the gluon contribution to @xmath24 is f_l  =  _ s  c^1_lg g , and therefore at </S>",
    "<S> this order  =  -_0  ^2_s   c^1_lg g  +   ^2_s   c^1_lg p^(0)_gg g  +  quark  term . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 , whereas @xmath26 contains a term @xmath27 , i.e. the gluon loses momentum to the quarks it radiates . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for example , in going from the @xmath0 renormalization scheme to the @xmath4 renormalization scheme , the change in these two terms cancels out , leaving the physical quantity independent of choice of number of active quarks @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> however if the coupling and the structure functions use a different number of active quarks , as is often done , the cancellation does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this inconsistent choice on the gluon distribution is shown in fig.[fig : gluwffns ] . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon evolved using the incorrect coupling evolves more quickly than that with the correct coupling since the coupling is always larger in the former case . by @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> the incorrect gluon is about @xmath30 larger at @xmath31 . at @xmath32 , where there is little change with @xmath6 , the gluons are very similar , but at high @xmath33 the gluon with the incorrect coupling decreases more quickly and at @xmath29 is up to @xmath30 smaller at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the error on the gluon due to the mistake in the choice of coupling is generally of similar size to the uncertainty due to experimental errors in @xcite . as such </S>",
    "<S> , this effect is far from insignificant . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect is seen in the quark distributions , i.e. evolution is too quick , and some effects due to internal quark loops are double - counted .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    we make the correctly generated 3- and 4-flavour ffns parton distributions , which we denote by mrst2004ff3 and mrst2004ff4 , generally available . </S>",
    "<S> we do this at both nlo and also at lo since lo partons are sometimes needed for lo monte carlo programmes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lo partons are the companions to those in @xcite , i.e. the mrst2001 lo partons , and as in this previous paper we point out that the lo partons are not able to give a genuinely good global fit and should be used with caution . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo 3-flavour gluon and singlet - quark distributions are compared to their vfns counterparts in fig.[fig : glusing ] . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon distribution is always bigger in the 3-flavour scheme because of the extra radiation of gluons to charm and bottom quarks in the vfns . </S>",
    "<S> this extra positive evolution outweighs the decreased evolution due to the lower 3-flavour coupling at low @xmath33 . at high </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 both the lower coupling and the lack of radiation to quarks slow the decrease of the 3-flavour gluon relative to that of the vfns gluon . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects are shown in fig.[fig : gluffvfevol ] . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-flavour gluon is hence always bigger than the vfns gluon for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , as seen in fig.[fig : glusing ] , the singlet quark distribution is always correspondingly bigger . </S>",
    "<S> almost all of this is difference is due to the presence of the charm and bottom quarks , which carry the extra momentum lost by the vfns gluon . in order to highlight the difference between the 3-flavour and vfns gluon we also plot in fig.[fig : gglumiff ] the ratio of the corresponding @xmath36 luminosity functions @xmath37 for producing a heavy particle of mass @xmath38 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the larger 3-flavour gluon always leads to a larger luminosity , particularly when probing very high @xmath33 where the gluons differ most . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the extreme care which must be taken in using the correctly defined gluon together with the correctly defined coupling and hard cross - section in any predictions for particle production at the lhc or tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.7    = 0.7    this latter point also illustrates the difficulty in performing a correct global fit to parton distributions with a ffns , i.e. we need exact versions of the nlo hard cross - sections which should be used with the ffns partons . </S>",
    "<S> all will have logarithms in @xmath39 , which compensate for the missing heavy quark parton distributions , along with other mass effects . </S>",
    "<S> ( here the subscript @xmath40 or @xmath41 . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , these are not known for all processes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our decision to generate instead sets of ffns partons which are consistent with our standard partons below @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we are easily able to calculate the structure function @xmath43 in the ffns scheme however . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this scheme the coefficient functions for heavy flavour production begin at order @xmath15 , so lo corresponds to @xmath44 coefficient functions , nlo to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , _ etc._. </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent since the @xmath44 coefficient function contains information on the lo splitting function @xmath47 the @xmath45 coefficient function on the nlo splitting function @xmath48 , _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ , so at each order the evolution of the heavy flavour structure function is roughly correct . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo cross - sections for the heavy flavour contributions have long existed as semi - analytic code @xcite where the dominant contributions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( from above ) are analytic and the rest numerical . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo coefficient functions for heavy flavour production are not known yet , though approximate expressions for low @xmath6 are derived in @xcite , which enables one to define a nnlo vfns . as another by - product of the definition of the scheme in @xcite there exist faster analytic expressions for the nlo coefficient functions which are exact for @xmath51 and in some cases for @xmath50 , and the @xmath52 remainders are provided by fitting the values to analytic functions with a number of free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these final expressions are slightly approximate , but the error in @xmath53 is only @xmath54 , even in the most extreme cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for the charm structure function and bottom structure function in the ffns compared to that from the mrst2004 partons using vfns coefficient functions ( using the scheme of @xcite appropriate for these partons ) are shown in fig.[fig : bottevol ] , where the factorization scale @xmath55 has been used in both cases . clearly heavy flavour production is generally suppressed in the ffns compared to the vfns . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is interesting to note that at extremely high @xmath6 the charm structure function in the vfns for very small @xmath33 has come back towards that in the ffns and even goes a little below the ffns result . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for these very large values of @xmath56 the extra powers of @xmath57 resummed by the vfns procedure are accompanied by multiple convolutions of splitting functions containing information on the loss of charm quarks due to radiation to gluons and even smaller @xmath33 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this information is missing in the ffns which only contains the first two powers of @xmath57 and the accompanying splitting functions .    </S>",
    "<S> .quality of the ffns comparison to some data sets , together with the corresponding @xmath58 values for the standard nlo vfns fit to the same data . here </S>",
    "<S> the ffns partons are not obtained by fitting to data , but rather are generated by a ff ( @xmath0 ) evolution from the vfns input distributions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     this general suppression of heavy flavour in ffns means the quality of the match to the data using the mrst ffns partons is not expected to be very good in regions where the charm contribution to the structure function is important . in the table we show the contributions to @xmath58 from various subsets of the _ data fitted _ in the global analysis which yields the nlo mrst2004 ( vfns ) partons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the table compares these values with the @xmath58 obtained from the ffns partons _ generated _ using the mrst2004 partons as input at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that the latter partons are not obtained in a new fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath58 for the hera ( h1 , zeus ) data is indeed significantly larger using the ffns partons . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that at small @xmath60 increases with @xmath6 up to @xmath61 more slowly in the ffns . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath62 is a major component of the total @xmath63 at small @xmath33 , this leads to a general undershooting of these hera data . </S>",
    "<S> note that the description of the fixed - target ( bcdms , slac ) structure function data is not changed significantly in going from vfns to ffns , while the nmc data is slightly sensitive to the charm structure function and is affected a little more . </S>",
    "<S> this consistency in the fixed - target data is because the slowing down of the evolution above @xmath64 , due to the reduced coupling , is largely compensated by the @xmath28 dependence of the nlo splitting functions . </S>",
    "<S> if we were to use the vfns coupling for the ffns partons the description of the fixed - target data would be worse . </S>",
    "<S> as already noted , the smaller @xmath15 for the ffns partons at high @xmath6 is accompanied by a larger gluon distribution at large @xmath33 due to the slower evolution . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects compensate in the description of the tevatron inclusive jet data which , as far as one can tell without ffns jet coefficient functions , is similar for both schemes .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.45 = 0.45    we notice that it is the charm ( and bottom ) data themselves , and hence the description of the small @xmath33 structure function data , that are the most sensitive to the choice of the scheme for the heavy flavours , which is , of course , not unexpected . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if we do attempt a fit to as much data in the global fit as possible in the ffns scheme our comparison to hera data is always 80 units of @xmath58 or so worse than in the vfns scheme , even though the value of the 3-flavour coupling increases significantly in an attempt to fit the small-@xmath33 data more successfully . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in the coupling is such that it causes the fit to fixed - target data to deteriorate . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this difficulty in fitting small-@xmath33 structure function data in a ffns scheme would be generally observed if the correct definition of the coupling were used and constraints from data sets other than dis data were applied in such fits . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we conclude that it is always preferable , if possible , to work in a variable - flavour number scheme for parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> however , recognising that this is not always possible for current applications , and also that there is a general interest in ffns partons , we use this paper to advertise and make available our 3-flavour and 4-flavour scheme partons generated from the same input as our 2004 vfns partons , but consistently evolved in these two alternative schemes . </S>"
