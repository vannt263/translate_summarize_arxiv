    "in the rapidly advancing field of exoplanetary research , one of the most important questions is whether a given planet is capable of sustaining life @xcite , and , if so , identifying the different avenues by which the signatures of life may be detected @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that life engenders chemical disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "thus , the most commonly studied method of detecting life entails the search for biosignature gases , such as oxygen and methane , occurring at disproportionately high levels @xcite .",
    "owing to the predominance and smaller size of m - dwarfs , many studies have been conducted pertaining to the detection of biosignature gases from habitable planets transiting such stars ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context",
    ", the recent discovery of proxima centauri b @xcite , the nearest exoplanet , represents an excellent opportunity to investigate the existence and composition of its atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , there are problematic issues with detecting biosignature gases , such as false positives arising from abiotic production @xcite .",
    "hence , alternative means of detecting extraterrestrial life are also being pursued concomitantly .",
    "one of the most notable amongst them is the prospect of detecting vegetation by means of the `` red edge '' arising from a rapid change in the reflectance of vegetation around @xmath0 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the identification of the red edge can be viewed as a particular case of the more general statement that photometric observations of exoplanets can reveal many of their fundamental properties @xcite , such as the fractional coverage of their surface by oceans , land and vegetation @xcite ; the former , in particular , may be identifiable by means of the `` glint '' effect @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "we begin by exploring the connections between vegetation and temperature and the resulting detectability of the  _ natural _ red edge .",
    "subsequently , we conduct a detailed study of the potential existence , implications and detection of _ artificial _ spectral edges on exoplanets , with a particular focus on tidally locked planets in the habitable zone ( hz ) of m - dwarfs , such as proxima b.",
    "we examine the potential distribution and detection of vegetation on habitable exoplanets , since photosynthesis is correlated with the emergence of carbon - based extraterrestrial life @xcite .",
    "the vegetation on earth is governed primarily by the temperature and amount of water available @xcite .",
    "recent evidence appears to point towards temperature being more strongly correlated with vegetation traits than precipitation @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the global maps of vegetation and mean annual temperature on earth appears to support the hypothesized correlation .",
    "temperature also plays a major role in regulating the size , diversity , carrying capacity , and evolutionary rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist clear links between the climate ( particularly temperature ) , biodiversity and evolution @xcite .    hence , at least to leading order , the temperature can be viewed as being the key deterministic factor in regulating the properties of vegetation .",
    "the inferred temperature @xcite may serve as a proxy for quantifying the extent to which vegetation can cover a planet , as well as predicting the large - scale distribution of flora and fauna",
    ". this technique would be particularly useful in case the red edge can not be detected on account of the vegetation being sparse or the existence of a high cloud cover @xcite .",
    "the peak incident photon flux on planets orbiting m - dwarfs is shifted towards longer wavelengths .",
    "hence , the `` red edge '' on these planets , such as proxima b , may manifest in the near - ir region , typically at @xmath2 @xmath1 m @xcite . nevertheless , the euv flux on the day side of proxima b is @xmath3 times larger than on earth @xcite , potentially making spectral features in the euv reflectance detectable as well .",
    "photosynthesis is constrained to occur in the fairly narrow range between @xmath4 k and @xmath5 k ( see section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the lower limit @xmath6 equals the lower bound for the prevalence of life .",
    "the upper bound for the latter is @xmath7 k , which is more than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "specifically , we focus on proxima b , for which the prospects of sensitive observations are highest , and adopt the following toy atmospheric model for this planet @xcite , @xmath9 ; \\quad 0 < |\\theta| \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the longitude and @xmath11 is the zenith angle . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the bond albedo , @xmath13 is the irradiance , and @xmath14 is the fraction of the incident stellar energy that is transported by the atmosphere to the night side .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that tidal locking exists , although a @xmath15 resonance ought not be ruled out @xcite .    for @xmath16 ,",
    "the night side has a temperature of @xmath17 k , whereas the day side has a temperature of @xmath18 k @xcite .",
    "clearly , for low values of @xmath11 , both the day and night side are not amenable to photosynthesis .",
    "in contrast , for the maximal value of @xmath19 , an isothermal atmosphere with a temperature of @xmath20 k is attained .",
    "but , this represents an equally worse scenario since the day and night side would be frozen , and photosynthesis would not operate anywhere .",
    "thus , an intermediate value of @xmath14 is optimal for ensuring the maximal extent of photosynthesis .",
    "additional factors that should be taken into account are the possible presence of a greenhouse effect @xcite , and the absence of light on the night side @xcite .",
    "we explore how and why artificial spectral edges could be operational on planets whose surfaces were modified by advanced civilizations . by an `` artificial edge ''",
    ", we refer to a distinctive change in the reflectivity over a fairly narrow bandwidth , analogous to the red edge arising from vegetation .      on earth ,",
    "most sources of energy have been derived either directly or indirectly from solar power . to meet the growing energy needs ,",
    "there has been a greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy , on account of its many advantages @xcite . in particular",
    ", the production costs of solar energy have declined rapidly @xcite .",
    "many of these facts ought to be applicable to advanced civilizations on exoplanets .",
    "one may therefore assume that they require energy for sustenance , and that it would be more sensible to rely on renewable sources such as stellar energy .",
    "this is particularly true of habitable exoplanets around m - dwarfs , which are typically tidally locked @xcite .",
    "the day side would receive continual illumination which enhances the effectiveness of exploiting stellar energy .",
    "thus , we shall henceforth adopt the premise that advanced civilizations cover a significant fraction of the day side of the planet with photovoltaic devices ( solar cells ) , which are robust , efficient and versatile @xcite .      currently , most solar cells are made out of pure silicon in different forms , which , despite its limitations @xcite , is widely employed on account of its relative abundance .",
    "although we focus on silicon henceforth , our analysis should be valid for other photovoltaic materials that display an `` absorption edge '' @xcite .",
    "advanced civilizations may conceivably inhabit planets where photovoltaic materials with higher efficiencies are commonly available , implying that their counterparts of solar cells would not be silicon - based .",
    "although this case can not ( and ought not ) be dismissed , there are important reasons that favor the use of silicon for producing mega - scale photovoltaic arrays .",
    "the primary reason is the high cosmic abundance of silicon compared to other photovoltaic elements .",
    "this statement has considerable evidence , both empirical and theoretical , as heavy elements are generated via supernovae nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "hence , in purely probabilistic terms , planets are more likely to be endowed with larger reserves of silicon .",
    "moreover , the importance of silicon in habitability , especially in the galactic context , has also been documented @xcite .",
    "the abundance of silicon is also closely linked with the cost of refining , processing and manufacturing silicon - based solar cells @xcite .",
    "for instance , the present economic expenditures involved in producing gallium arsenide photovoltaics are approximately @xmath21-@xmath22 orders of magnitude higher than their silicon counterparts @xcite .",
    "another important reason is more viable for g - type ( and perhaps k - type ) stars , such as the sun .",
    "the seminal work of @xcite enabled the computation of the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell ( which uses one p - n junction ) .",
    "as per modern estimates , it is around @xmath23 for a band gap of around @xmath24 ev @xcite .",
    "silicon has a band gap of @xmath25 ev , which is close to @xmath26 .",
    "another important factor considered by @xcite is the `` ultimate efficiency '' , which considers the efficiency only based on spectrum losses , ignoring other factors such as impedance matching .",
    "the ultimate efficiency is higher than the aforementioned theoretical efficiency , occurring at a band gap @xmath27 of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the boltzmann factor and @xmath30 is the blackbody temperature of the star . using @xmath31 k for the sun , we see that @xmath32 ev , which equals @xmath33 .",
    "thus , silicon constitutes a fairly effective photovoltaic material for g - type stars .    for m - dwarfs ,",
    "the efficiency of silicon , as per the basic estimates in @xcite , will be lowered .",
    "but , the shockley - queisser limit can be bypassed in several ways , ranging from multiple p - n junctions to concentrating starlight @xcite .",
    "in addition , the existence of continual starlight on tidally locked planets , which occur more often around m - dwarfs , may also compensate for any reduction in the conversion efficiency .       for silicon ( black ) and vegetation ( red )",
    "is shown as a function of wavelength @xmath34 .",
    "the former was adapted from @xcite , whereas the latter ( oak leaf ) is derived from @xcite.,width=340 ]    based on the line of reasoning advanced above , one can envision planets covered with mega - scale arrays of solar cells made of silicon . to quantify the prospects of detecting such structures ,",
    "the reflectance of silicon is plotted in fig .",
    "[ reflectance ] based on table 1 and figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the marked increase in the reflectivity of silicon in the uv region is nearly as dramatic as the red edge of vegetation on earth at @xmath0 @xmath1 m .",
    "hence , the former is dubbed an `` artificial edge '' on account of its similarity with the latter .",
    "silicon also exhibits a red ` shoulder ' , as seen from fig .",
    "[ reflectance ] , which is conceivably a distinct signature .",
    "although we have focused on silicon due to the reasons delineated earlier , similar artificial edges would be realized in the spectra of other photovoltaic materials , such as gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride @xcite .",
    "in fact , for certain ( less ubiquitous ) photovoltaic materials such as organometal halide perovskites , the `` artificial edge '' is manifested at visible wavelengths @xmath35",
    "@xmath1 m @xcite , which may enhance the chances of detection . the application of anti - reflective coatings will also lead to distinctive spectral features .",
    "broadly speaking , any discernible change in the reflectance within a fairly narrow band that can not be explained by natural causes ( e.g. vegetation , oceans , soil ) merits further investigation .",
    "another striking similarity between natural vegetation and photovoltaic arrays is that , on tidally locked planets , they would most likely exist on the day side .",
    "the fraction of the exoplanet s surface covered by edge - producing materials can be deduced by analyzing the temporal photometric variability @xcite .",
    "a schematic illustration of this approach has been presented in fig .",
    "[ schematic]a .",
    "the search for `` artificial edges '' on exoplanets is warranted and feasible with future telescopes , such as the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) , large uv / optical / infrared surveyor ( luvoir ) , habitable exoplanet imaging mission ( habex ) , and high - definition space telescope ( hdst ) .",
    "the change in the reflected - light contrast is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the reflectance , @xmath38 is the fraction of the surface covered by photovoltaic panels , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the radius of the planet and its distance from the star respectively .",
    "note that @xmath40 has been normalized in terms of proxima b s semi - major axis @xcite . the characteristic values of @xmath41 fall within the proposed sensitivity of wfirst ( @xmath42 ppm ) and luvoir ( @xmath43 ppm ) , even for relatively small values of @xmath38 .    the planet s atmosphere , if present , filters the reflected light from the surface , but the artificial edge could still be manifested , albeit in a modulated form .",
    "we examine the possibility of detecting artificial edges either directly or indirectly , and the inferences that can be drawn from their existence .      in principle , one can infer the fractional area of vegetation through photometric observations @xcite .",
    "owing to the similarities between artificial and red edges discussed in section [ ssecartedge ] , @xmath38 could be computed .",
    "the stellar power captured is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the irradiance and bond albedo respectively .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath38 in conjunction with ( [ powpv ] ) enables a heuristic calculation of the civilization class on the kardashev scale @xcite .",
    "if mega - scale photovoltaic arrays are functional , the generated power can be put to many uses .",
    "solar cells can be particularly useful on tidally locked planets around m - dwarfs since the day side receives continual illumination .",
    "the extracted energy could be used to power a plethora of processes on the night side , such as : + * ( i ) heat redistribution : * the simple climate model explored in eq . ( [ climmodel ] ) suggests that the day side is too hot for the sustenance of life ( and photosynthesis ) , whilst the night side is too cold if atmosphere - based redistribution is inefficient @xmath48 .",
    "it may therefore be desirable to generate energy on the day side and redistribute it artificially to the night side . + * ( ii ) light generation : * a requirement for photosynthesis is the availability of photons .",
    "the night side enshrouded in perpetual darkness may prove inimical to photosynthesis .",
    "generating large - scale solar energy is advantageous , since it could be tapped for generating light on the night side to induce photosynthesis .",
    "the consequently larger population of autotrophs would be capable of supporting greater numbers of heterotrophs .",
    "+ a schematic depiction of these terraforming processes is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematic]b .",
    "all of the above operations have important ramifications in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) .",
    "if vegetation is detected on the night side at levels that are higher than predictions based on conventional models , it can be indicative of artificial heat and light redistribution , thereby pointing towards the existence of an advanced civilization .    detecting the existence and composition of exoplanetary atmospheres and oceans , and determining the surface temperature are both technically feasible @xcite .",
    "hence , if a discrepancy between the two is detected , i.e. evidence of heat redistribution that exceeds the theoretical predictions ( based on the atmosphere and ocean circulation ) , this may serve as a signature of extraterrestrial technology reliant on stellar energy .",
    "this signature could be detected even with jwst , based on the analysis in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed techniques for detecting artificial illumination , albeit in the solar system context .",
    "anomalous lighting , _ primarily _ on the night side of a tidally locked exoplanet , could signify the existence of extraterrestrial activity based on stellar energy redistribution .",
    "the feasibility of detecting artificial lighting on the dark side has been recently explored in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and it was concluded that it falls within the capabilities of jwst .",
    "these statements are _ specific _ to stellar power , since other energy sources ought not be dependent on the distinction between the day and night sides .",
    "thus , the existence of mega - scale photovoltaic arrays are also detectable through the above routes .      our basic premise",
    ", that civilizations are advanced enough to build large - scale arrays , implicitly falls under the purview of the rapidly advancing field of ` dysonian ' seti - looking for alien mega - structures @xcite .",
    "but , we note that the civilizations considered here are typically of the kardashev i type , unlike most dysonian seti projects that have investigated kardashev ii or iii civilizations .",
    "alien civilizations may have become extinct , or moved on elsewhere , but left behind these arrays .",
    "although such devices would undergo wear and tear , they can remain functional for a duration of time that is not insignificant by astrophysical standards . in this instance",
    ", such arrays would constitute genuine extraterrestrial artifacts ( albeit `` recent '' ones ) .",
    "although interstellar archaeology , in general , lies beyond our current technological capabilities @xcite , the scenario studied herein ought to constitute a genuine counterexample .",
    "we have based our discussion on habitable exoplanets , typically those around m - dwarfs , but a greater range of possibilities exist .",
    "large - scale photovoltaic arrays are capable of being operational even on habitable exomoons @xcite , although they are truly effective only when the incident stellar flux is significant",
    ". they may even be present on ` uninhabitable ' planets , such as those without an atmosphere or with high temperatures .",
    "these panels can also exist on artificial mega - structures , such as dyson spheres , for the purpose of generating electrical energy . in each case , the stellar energy could be used to power beacons or drive light sails , as recently hypothesized in @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we briefly discussed the distribution of vegetation on exoplanets and its detectability via the spectral `` red edge '' .",
    "we followed this up by positing the existence of `` artificial edges '' that can be studied along similar lines .",
    "our hypothesis stemmed from two simple considerations .",
    "the first is that a civilization needs a power supply , which is easily met via stellar energy .",
    "we reasoned that mega - scale photovoltaic arrays for extracting stellar energy should be made of silicon on account of its wide availability , optimal processing and manufacturing , and reasonable efficiency .",
    "we highlighted the distinctive spectral features of silicon which could make the detection of such arrays feasible , provided that : ( i ) they are large enough , ( ii ) the viewing angle is favorable , and ( iii ) the cloud cover is limited .",
    "the implications arising from the existence of large - scale photovoltaic arrays were explored , including the connections with a civilization s kardashev class .",
    "we argued that the harnessed energy can be employed for undertaking a host of terraforming activities such as : ( i ) heat and light redistribution , ( ii ) induced photosynthesis on the night side of tidally locked planets , and ( iii ) generating artificial beams .",
    "all of these possibilities are likely to be detectable in their own right , thereby improving the chances of testing our hypothesis .",
    "the search for these artifacts belongs to the category of dysonian seti , which has attracted a great deal of attention in recent times .",
    "although our discussion was centered around silicon - based cells , our analysis is potentially valid for other photovoltaic devices , fuels and raw materials ( such as steel , carbon nanotubes and glass ) used for constructing mega - structures . in all of these examples , clear - cut patterns in the photometric variations might be manifested that are not explicable by natural features , thereby serving as indicators of advanced civilizations .",
    "we thank james guillochon , nia imara , laura kreidberg , zac manchester and gary melnick for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "ml wishes to thank chuanfei dong for his generous assistance .",
