    "recent experimental measurements of elliptic anisotropy have challenged the conventional hydrodynamic picture of relativistic heavy - ion collisions that had proven very effective in facilitating our understanding of many features of particle production in such collisions @xcite .",
    "for instance , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , at a given energy and centrality of a collision the elliptic flow for particles and antiparticles is slightly different . in particular the elliptic flow for protons is larger than for antiprotons , and the difference between the two decreases with increasing energy .",
    "this effect can be understood either as a result of baryon stopping @xcite or by including the mean - field potentials in the hadronic phase , as shown in the ampt model xu:2012gf .",
    "an intellectually more challenging experimental observation is the dependence of elliptic flow for @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a function of the event - by - event fluctuating asymmetry parameter , @xmath7where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote , respectively , the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles at a given acceptance region .",
    "according to the preliminary star data @xcite , at a certain energy and centrality class , the elliptic flow for @xmath5 is a decreasing function of @xmath10 , and , for @xmath6 , the opposite trend is observed . in",
    "particular@xmath11where @xmath12 denotes an average elliptic flow at a given value of @xmath4 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parameters .",
    "the preliminary star data shows that in au+au mid - peripheral collisions at various energies @xmath15 @xcite , where both @xmath4 and @xmath16 are measured in @xmath17 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this dependence can not be understood in the baryon- ( or isospin- ) stopping scenario . moreover ,",
    "both urqmd @xcite and ampt @xcite models fail to describe the linear relation ( v2diff ) @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) was proposed as evidence of the effects of a chiral magnetic wave @xcite .",
    "this effect is closely related to the chiral magnetic effect @xcite , discussed extensively in the recent literature , e.g. , the recent review in @xcite .    in this paper , we demonstrate that eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) is consistent with the hydrodynamic picture of heavy - ion collisions with local charge conservation at freeze - out .",
    "we discuss the relation between eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) and the physics underlying the charge balance function @xcite , successfully described by hydrodynamic models , e.g. , schlichting:2010qia , bozek:2012en . in the following section , we derive a general relation between @xmath18 and @xmath4 , yielding a linear dependence . in section @xmath19 , we discuss two mechanisms that qualitatively and partly quantitatively reproduce the experimental data . in section @xmath20",
    ", we detail state - of - the - art @xmath21-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations with local charge conservation , observing a strong signal consistent with the experimental one , within a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "section @xmath23 gives our comments and conclusions .",
    "in this section we derive the relation between elliptic flow at a given @xmath4 , @xmath12 , as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath4 . here , for simplicity , we assume that the distribution of @xmath4 at a given centrality class is symmetric with respect to @xmath25 .. ]    straightforwardly , we notice that for a sufficiently small @xmath4@xmath26where @xmath27 is a parameter whose value is close to unity and @xmath28 , then @xmath29 . in the star measurement , @xmath30 and @xmath4",
    "are calculated from similar sets of particles , but not identical ones .",
    "this distinction may engender a value that differs slightly from @xmath31 .",
    "] , see eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath32 denotes an average over all events characterized by @xmath25 .",
    "we readily notice that @xmath33the left - hand side of the above equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath34 ; thus , only the even powers of @xmath4 are allowed .",
    ", for example , we could increase @xmath35 , or / and decrease @xmath36 .",
    "thus , for larger values of @xmath4 , @xmath36 is expected to decline as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we verified this in our simple model discussed in the next section , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . ] these equations above support our evaluation of @xmath39 and @xmath40@xmath41    to express elliptic flow at a given @xmath4 as a function of @xmath4 we write@xmath42and analogously for negative particles .",
    "here , @xmath43 represents an average number of particles responsible for a non - zero value of @xmath4 . integrating the above equation over @xmath44 and @xmath45 we obtain eq .",
    "( [ npm ] ) that allows us to express @xmath46 by @xmath47 and @xmath4 . multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ d3n ] ) by @xmath48 and integrating over an available phase space , assuming @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and neglecting the @xmath51 terms , we obtain@xmath52 , \\]]and @xmath53 , \\]]where @xmath18 denotes elliptic flow at a given value of @xmath4 , and @xmath54 represents an average elliptic flow of particles responsible for a non - zero value of @xmath4 . the elliptic flow for all events with @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "as is evident from the above equations , a linear dependence on @xmath4 is expected naturally only if the elliptic flow of particles contributing to a non - zero asymmetry differs from the elliptic flow of particles leading to @xmath25 . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss two mechanisms that naturally lead to @xmath56 , being qualitatively consistent with the preliminary data .",
    "in this section , we discuss two mechanisms that offer qualitative and partly quantitative agreement with the preliminary star data .    from various measurements of the balance function in rapidity , we know that electric charges balance each other with a characteristic distance between the charges of about @xmath57 unit of rapidity @xcite .",
    "this finding is confirmed successfully in the hydrodynamic model with locally conserved charge production at freeze - out schlichting:2010qia , bozek:2012en .",
    "consequently , a pair of pions with opposite charges originating from a fluid element or a resonance , create a non - zero @xmath4 in a given rapidity window provided that one pion is produced inside of this window and the other outside it .",
    "if both charges are produced inside a bin they do not contribute to @xmath35 .",
    "in the star experiment , the elliptic flow is measured in @xmath58 that is broader than the typical width of the balance function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_eta ] , we schematically depict the first mechanism , leading to eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) .",
    "fluid elements and resonances , in short clusters , located close to @xmath59 usually produce both pions inside the pseudorapidity window . only clusters located close to @xmath60 typically create a non - zero asymmetry parameter . from the phobos data @xcite , we know that elliptic flow of charged particles as a function of pseudorapidity can be roughly described as @xmath61 ( further discussed in section 5 ) .",
    "thus , clusters located close to @xmath60 have smaller elliptic flow compared to clusters located close to @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , the elliptic flow of pairs responsible for a non - zero asymmetry is smaller than that of pairs leading to @xmath25 . using eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) we conclude that @xmath62 decreases and @xmath63 increases as a function of @xmath4 .",
    ", for example , we trigger configurations wherein positive pions are inside a rapidity window and the negative ones are outside it . in this way",
    ", we add positive particles with small @xmath16 and , effectively , the @xmath16 for positive particles is lowered .",
    "since the number of negative particles with a small @xmath16 is reduced , thus effectively , their @xmath16 is increased . ]    , decay into final particles located inside the rapidity bin @xmath64 and clearly can not create a non - zero asymmetry , @xmath4 .",
    "only clusters located close to the boundary can produce one pion inside and one pion outside of our rapidity bin . from the phobos data ,",
    "we know that elliptic flow is slightly smaller away from @xmath59 . consequently , the elliptic flow of particles creating the asymmetry , @xmath65 , is smaller than that of particles leading to zero asymmetry , @xmath25 . ]",
    "the second mechanism is explicitly related to the late locally conserved charge production in the hydrodynamic picture , see fig .",
    "[ fig_pt ] .",
    "clusters with small transverse momentum ( resonances ) or small transverse velocity ( fluid elements ) usually decay into pairs of pions with a large rapidity separation ( a broad balance function ) .",
    "in contrast , clusters with large transverse momentum or velocity engender a small rapidity separation ( a narrow balance function ) .",
    "undoubtedly , clusters with a broad balance function are more likely to produce a non - zero charge asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 . on the other hand , we know that the elliptic flow of clusters with a small transverse momentum ( velocity ) is less than that of clusters with a high transverse momentum , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "consequently @xmath66 is smaller than @xmath24 , so leading to the linear dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath4 .     are mainly driven by clusters with a small @xmath45 that are characterized by a small @xmath16 . thus , the elliptic flow of particles creating asymmetry , @xmath65 , is smaller than that of particles leading to zero asymmetry , @xmath25 . ]    to quantify these effects , we undertook a simplified monte carlo calculation .. all clusters were uniformly distributed in pseudorapidity over @xmath68 and in transverse momentum according to the thermal distribution , @xmath69 with @xmath70 gev .",
    "a cluster with a given @xmath71 and @xmath45 decays into two oppositely charged particles , located symmetrically around @xmath71 .",
    "the pseudorapidity distance between them is sampled from the gaussian distribution with its standard deviation @xmath72 , so that for a cluster with @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "this dependence on @xmath45 approximately agrees with a rho meson decay at a given @xmath45 into two pions . finally , we sampled the azimuthal angles of the two particles using @xmath75 with @xmath76 given by @xmath77 for @xmath78 gev , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 gev . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath16 are calculated for particles in @xmath17 .",
    "in our calculation we obtained @xmath81 , and approximately @xmath82 charged particles in the midrapidity region @xmath17 , approximately agreeing with @xmath83 gev au+au collisions in the @xmath84 centrality class . ] as shown in fig .",
    "fig_model , the signal we obtained is of the same order - of - magnitude as the data .",
    "in fact , we obtained @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) , that is only a factor of @xmath86 smaller than the preliminary star data , @xmath15 . in our calculation , both @xmath4 and @xmath16 are calculated for particles in @xmath17 .",
    "however , we note that our results represent only an order - of - magnitude estimate , and more advanced calculations are required to draw definite conclusions .    .",
    "in our simplified model we obtain @xmath87 see eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) , to be compared with the preliminary star data @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig_eta ] is responsible approximately for @xmath88 of the signal shown in fig .",
    "we also checked that calculating @xmath16 in @xmath89 and @xmath4 in latexmath:[$|\\eta    when calculating @xmath16 in @xmath91 , and @xmath4 in @xmath17 , we obtained a significantly smaller value , @xmath92 .",
    "taking @xmath16 in @xmath93 and @xmath4 in @xmath17 lowers our results approximately by a factor of @xmath94 . finally , we mention that in our simplified analysis we neglected experimental cuts in the transverse momentum which may slightly modify our numbers",
    ".    it would be desirable to perform a more realistic calculations in an event - by - event @xmath21-dimensional hydrodynamic model , wherein the effect presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_pt ] is naturally present .",
    "this problem is discussed in the next section .",
    "the collective flow in heavy - ion collisions can be reproduced satisfactory within relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "statistical emission and resonance decay at freeze - out account for part of the observed charge balancing correlations .",
    "additionally , local charge balancing in particle production @xcite can be included in the event generator bozek:2012en , yielding the right qualitative description of the one- and two - dimensional charge dependent correlations .",
    "we used a @xmath21-dimensional hydrodynamic model with statistical emission at freeze - out including the local charge conservation mechanism and resonance decays @xcite . in order to study non - flow correlations , particle emission from the freeze - out hypersurface",
    "should be done via monte - carlo event generation .",
    "the default implementation of the statistical emission in therminator @xcite generates primordial particles with the poisson distribution for each type of particle . in the present calculation ,",
    "we fix the total charge produced in the fireball , for simplicity fixing the multiplicities for all particles emitted from the fireball in each event .",
    "the charge asymmetry measured in a limited acceptance window mainly is due to the separation of an unlike charged pair as described in the previous section .     and @xmath95 elliptic flow coefficients in the hydrodynamic model followed by statistical emission with local charge conservation .",
    "we obtained @xmath96 compared with the preliminary star data , @xmath15 . ]",
    "the statistical emission code @xcite follows resonance decays , and such charge correlations are realistically described in the model . together with the effects of local charge conservation , correlating the emission of primordial particles",
    ", it yields a good quantitative description of charge balance functions in semi - central au - au collisions bozek:2011ua . to study the weak charge splitting signal ,",
    "a large statistics is required .",
    "we generated @xmath97 events for the centrality 30 - 40% wherein the measured signal is the strongest , and where the hydrodynamic model agrees best with the data on charge balance functions . the elliptic flow , @xmath16 , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 is calculated for events with different charge asymmetry in the interval @xmath17 , using two subevents with a pseudorapidity separation @xmath98 to define @xmath99 , following the experimental procedure ke:2012qb .",
    "the monte - carlo calculation with local charge conservation and resonance decays exhibits the expected signal , viz .",
    ", a decrease of @xmath100 and an increase of @xmath101 with the charge asymmetry @xmath4 in the event ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hydcmw ] ) .",
    "the slope parameter , @xmath102 , is about one half of the observed magnitude .",
    "we note that the pseudorapidity dependence of the elliptic flow @xmath103 observed experimentally @xcite is noticeably underestimated in @xmath21-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the steeper pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath16 is expected to improve the agreement between the calculated charge splitting of the elliptic flow with the experimental findings . in the next section ,",
    "we comment further on this issue .",
    "finally , we discuss the centrality dependence of the signal .",
    "two effects that are not well controlled in hydrodynamic models may cause the decrease of the slope parameter for peripheral events .",
    "first , the balance function in pseudorapidity is widening for peripheral events .",
    "second , for peripheral events , correlations due to elliptic flow are diluted by the larger contribution of particles emitted from the nonthermal corona in the interaction region , while the charge asymmetry acquires contributions both from the core and the corona .",
    "several comments are warranted .",
    "\\(i ) in this paper we discussed two mechanisms leading to elliptic flow splitting as a function of the asymmetry parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "we note that we expect a similar effect for higher harmonics , @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , for the triangular flow@xmath105although the signal is expected to be significantly weaker in comparison to the case for @xmath16 . we expect that @xmath14 , see eq .",
    "( [ v2diff ] ) , should be smaller roughly by a factor of @xmath106 @xcite . this problem will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "\\(ii ) the key ingredient in our analysis is the assumption of local charge conservation at freeze - out . in this scenario ,",
    "particle pairs with higher momentum are more strongly collimated in rapidity than are pairs with smaller momentum , see fig .",
    "[ fig_pt ] .",
    "this allows us to understand the centrality dependence of the rapidity balance function @xcite , in contrast to models with initial charge creation ( such as urqmd ) . consequently , in models without late local charge conservation we do not expect to observe the elliptic flow splitting discussed in this paper .",
    "\\(iii ) according to the phobos data , the elliptic flow of charged particles in the midrapidity region changes significantly as a function of pseudorapidity @xcite .",
    "however , the results of the star collaboration indicate that elliptic flow in the midrapidity region weakly depends on @xmath71 abelev:2008ae , so being consistent with hydrodynamic calculations ( see section @xmath20 ) .",
    "consequently , the mechanism presented in fig . [ fig_eta ] may be suppressed if we take the star data into account .",
    "however , this is not a problem because , as we discussed in section @xmath19 , this mechanism is responsible for only @xmath107 of the measured signal , and @xmath88 of the signal presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .    in conclusion , we studied the dependence of the elliptic flow coefficients for positive and negative particles as a function of the event - by - event charge asymmetry parameter .",
    "recently , this phenomenon was interpreted as evidence of the chiral magnetic wave . in this paper",
    ", we argued that the origin of this effect may be less exotic and actually is consistent with the hydrodynamic picture of heavy - ion collisions with late local charge conservation .",
    "we argued that particle pairs leading to a non - zero asymmetry parameter , @xmath65 , are characterized by a smaller elliptic flow in contrast to particle pairs resulting in @xmath25 .",
    "we showed that this fact alone is sufficient to qualitatively explain the preliminary star data , in particular , a linear dependence of @xmath108 , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "our quantitative results , based on a simplified monte carlo estimation and the state of the art @xmath21-dimensional hydrodynamic model calculations , are in agreement , within a factor of @xmath22 , with the preliminary star data .",
