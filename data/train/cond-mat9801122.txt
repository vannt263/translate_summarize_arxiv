    "the calculation of finite temperature correlation functions is a long - standing problem in the theory of integrable models .",
    "apart from the obvious conceptual importance of the problem there are many direct applications of the results to experiments on quasi-1d materials like @xmath0 @xcite or @xmath1 @xcite , which are described by integrable models .",
    "finite temperature dynamical correlation functions in the systems have been measured by neutron scattering and nmr and it is highly desirable to develop a method to calculate them exactly .",
    "important progress was made during the eighties when it was realized that in gapless models conformal field theory can be used to obtain the low - temperature asymptotics of dynamical correlation functions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "however , models with a spectral gap as well as higher temperatures in gapless models remain outside the scope of the conformal approach .    in a remarkable further development it became possible to determine the behaviour of _ static _ correlators at finite temperatures through an ingenious mapping of integrable d - dimensional quantum theories to d+1-dimensional integrable classical statistical models @xcite .",
    "however , dynamical correlation functions can not presently be calculated by this approach .",
    "for integrable models with free fermionic spectra powerful methods to calculate finite temperature dynamical correlation functions have been available for some time @xcite . very recently",
    "the method of @xcite was successfully extended to cases corresponding to _ interacting _",
    "fermions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in @xcite a formula describing the exponential decay of correlations in the delta - function bose gas at finite temperatures was presented .",
    "said formula is implicit in the sense that it is written in terms of solutions of certain nonlinear integral equations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze these integral equations by both analytical and numerical methods and present explicit expressions for the correlation lengths describing the decay of correlations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 1",
    "we review some relevant facts on the delta - function bose gas . in section 2",
    "we study the special case of impenetrable bosons , in which particularly simple expressions for the correlation lengths are obtained at low temperatures . in section 3",
    "we consider the general case of interacting bosons and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the @xmath2-function bose gas is one of the paradigms of exactly solvable strongly correlated many - body problems in one spatial dimension .",
    "it describes @xmath3 bosons interacting _ via _ a repulsive @xmath2-function potential of strength @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 at the special value @xmath6 the model describes noninteracting hard - core bosons and essential simplifications occur in the exact solution .",
    "we refer to this case as `` impenetrable bosons '' .",
    "the second - quantized form of the model is known as the quantum nonlinear schrdinger equation and the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the canonical bose field @xmath7 as @xmath8    the model is solvable by bethe ansatz @xcite and in what follows we recall some important ingredients of the exact solution .    *",
    "* ground state and excitations * + in momentum space a pauli principle holds @xcite and consequently the zero temperature ground state is given by a filled fermi sea of negative energy pseudoparticles . at @xmath6",
    "this is simply the usual free - fermion ground state .",
    "the physics of the model is most conveniently described in terms of a rapidity variable @xmath9 , which is related to the momentum @xmath10 by + @xmath11 + where @xmath12 .",
    "the density @xmath13 of pseudoparticles in the ground state is described by the integral equation @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the rapidity corresponding to the fermi momentum @xmath16 and @xmath17 + excitations over the ground state can be either particles or holes .",
    "the particle energy as a function of the rapidity is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the chemical potential .",
    "we note that the excitation energy vanishes on the fermi surface @xmath20 .",
    "the dependence of the integration boundary @xmath15 on the chemical potential @xmath21 is determined from the condition ^0(q)= 0  . in the impenetrable case the excitation spectrum is given in terms of free - fermionic particle - hole excitations .",
    "the fermi velocity is defined as usual to be @xmath22 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the derivative of momentum with respect to rapidity on the fermi surface is called dressed charge and is related to the density of states on the fermi surface @xmath23 * * asymptotics of correlation functions * + the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions at very low temperatures can be determined from the exact finite - size spectrum by conformal field theory techniques @xcite .",

    "+ in @xcite the following formula describing the exponential decay of correlations at _ any _ temperature was derived from the determinant approach to quantum correlation functions @xcite @xmath26 the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the finite - temperature equivalents of the dressed energy , pseudoparticle density and fermi velocity defined above .",
    "they are solutions of the following integral equations @xcite ( ) & = & ^2-h- _",

    "t()&=&+ _ -^d  k ( , )  _ t ( )  . [ inteq ] the velocity @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 note that for @xmath31 these equations reduce to , and respectively .",
    "we first investigate the simpler case of impenetrable bosons . in the limit @xmath32 simplifies to @xcite @xmath33 and we are left with performing a single integral . expanding the exponentially decaying part of the integrand as || = -2_n=1^ ( -||(2n-1 ) ) we obtain an expansion of in terms of error functions and exponential functions , which in turn yield an _",
    "asymptotic _ low - temperature series on @xmath34 in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "the fermi velocity is @xmath36 , and we distinguish two cases .    * after some elementary calculations we find the following expansion for @xmath34 ( as defined in ) ~-_m=0^ ( ) ^2 m ( 1 - 2 ^ -2 - 2 m )  ( 2m+2 )  , where @xmath37 is the riemann zeta - function .",
    "note that this expansion breaks down as we approach @xmath38 .",
    "the first few terms are = -  .",
    "the inverse correlation length thus has an asymptotic power series expansion in _ odd _ powers of temperature for @xmath39 .",
    "we also see that in the space - like regime there is no exponential decay with respect to the time @xmath40 at low temperatures as the @xmath40-dependence only enters in terms such as @xmath41 which are smaller than any power of the temperature @xmath35 . * in the time - like regime we find that there are no power - law corrections to the conformal result = - - ( -[h - x^2/4t^2]/t ) +  thus , up to exponentially small corrections the conformal result is exact in the time - like regime and there is exponential decay of correlations with respect to @xmath40 only at small temperatures .    for general finite temperatures one needs to resort to numerical integration of .",
    "if we define a correlation length @xmath42 by = -(x - v_ft ) -(v_ft - x )  , [ length ] where @xmath43 is the heaviside theta - function , we can study the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath35 and the `` direction '' @xmath45 by determining @xmath34 numerically . from the above low - temperature analysis",
    "we already know that at very low temperatures @xmath44 becomes independent of @xmath45 .",

    "the dependence on @xmath47 becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures . in the regions @xmath48 and @xmath49 the dependence on @xmath47 disappears as expected .",
    "we also see that the exponential decay of correlations is fastest in the direction of the `` light - cone '' @xmath50 .",
    "we now consider the case of finite coupling constant @xmath51 . in order to derive an analytical low - temperature expansion of the correlation length we first need to perform an ( asymptotic ) expansion of @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath27 in powers of @xmath35 is readily established along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we first note that the function @xmath27 has precisely one zero for @xmath52 @xcite .",
