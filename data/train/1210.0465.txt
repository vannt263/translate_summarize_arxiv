    "in the last few years graphene has generated an intense amount of activities due to its numerous unique properties .",
    "@xcite apart from a very strong multidisciplinary interest in the properties of pure graphene , the scientific community is engaged heavily in the modifications of graphene to realize new and novel effects .",
    "there is a tremendous interest in tuning the electronic structure of graphene to open up an energy gap suitable for the applications in electronic devices .",
    "one of the ways is by the chemical modification of graphene @xcite and the other is to realize confined structures in the form of nanoribbons , nanodots etc .",
    "@xcite in this context , a considerable research effort is continuing in attaching hydrogen @xcite or fluorine atoms @xcite to graphene in order to have a stable composite system with a desired energy gap .",
    "graphane is a hydrogenated graphene lattice with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom giving rise to an insulating system with sp@xmath0 bonds , first predicted by ab initio theory @xcite and then confirmed by experiments .",
    "@xcite the most attractive aspect of hydrogenation in graphene is the opening of a band gap . in a previous paper , we studied various concentrations of hydrogenation on graphene .",
    "we showed that a semimetal to metal to insulator transition occurs as a function of hydrogen concentration in graphene and hydrogenation favors clustered configurations leading to the formation of compact islands .",
    "@xcite    one of the results in our earlier work as well as work reported by others @xcite showed that the patterning of graphane via hydrogen desorption , the partial hydrogenation with the simultaneous presence of bare and hydrogenated carbon atoms , is a novel way of modifying the properties of pure graphene .",
    "it turns out that such a pattern can lead to conducting channels , quantum dots , opening of band gap and finally magnetically coupled graphene / graphane interfaces .",
    "these interesting properties of graphene / graphane interface structures have attracted a large number of researchers .",
    "@xcite recent studies show that the energy band gaps of both armchair and zigzag graphane nanoribbons decrease as the nanoribbons become wider .",
    "@xcite a variety of other interesting properties such as thermal stability , interface engineering , thermal conductivity , etc .",
    "have also been investigated for these hybrid systems .",
    "@xcite recently zigzag graphene nanoribbons have been experimentally synthesized by selectively removing hydrogens from epitaxial graphane . @xcite thus patterning offers a definite possibility of generating stable nanoribbons in the form of patterned graphene nanoribbons .",
    "graphene being a potential candidate for spintronic device has led to a number of theoretical and experimental studies on the determination of the magnetic properties of graphene .",
    "@xcite the existence of a spin - polarized edge state has been predicted by a number of theoretical works , when graphene sheet is cut to have parallel zigzag edges ( called zigzag graphene nanoribbon or zgnr ) .",
    "@xcite however , armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agnr ) does not show such a spin - polarized state .",
    "the spin - polarized edge state in zgnr is predicted to be highly dependent on the edge geometry and may not be robust . @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that transition metal ( tm ) termination at the edge transforms semiconducting zgnr to a metallic one .",
    "@xcite it was also shown that fe terminated zgnr shows an anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling between the two edges of the nanoribbon .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been showed recently that the magnetic properties of transition metal doped zgnrs are more robust than those moments arising due to the edge geometry .",
    "@xcite the most attractive feature of patterning graphene with partial hydrogenation is the similarity of creating bare carbon channels having similar edge state properties as those of graphene nanoribbons",
    ". recently edge states of graphene / graphane interface has been studied using tight - binding approximation and it was shown that edge state of an interface oriented along a zigzag direction enhances the effects related to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "@xcite a recent study of zigzag graphene nanoribbon patterned on graphane using spin polarized _ ab initio _ calculations showed that the electronic and magnetic properties of the graphene / graphane superlattice strongly depends on the degree of hydrogenation at the interfaces between the two materials .",
    "@xcite    quite clearly the nature of electronic states in these two channels are different .",
    "the electrons in armchair channel are localized and non magnetic .",
    "however the electrons in zigzag channel are delocalized .",
    "a weak anti - ferromagnetic coupling across the edges exists which decreases as the width increases",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate the effect of magnetic impurities in both these channels .",
    "therefore we have carried out spin - polarized _ ab initio _ density functional theory calculations ( dft ) to study the electronic and magnetic response properties of one and two magnetic impurities placed in these channels .",
    "we have considered three different widths of the channels along with two to three possible fe - fe distances .",
    "we have also investigated the nature of the magnetic exchange coupling between two fe impurities .",
    "there is another aspect that needs attention namely the effect of spin orbit coupling .",
    "one may expect an increase in the orbital moment of nanostructures compared to that of the bulk due to reduced symmetry .",
    "an experimental determination of magnetic moments includes both spin and orbital moments .",
    "another point of relevance is the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the orbital magnetic moments including spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the hamiltonian and have also discussed the strength of magnetic anisotropy along with the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "it is noteworthy that one of us has shown recently @xcite that the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) of an fe atom of fe - porphyrin molecule deposited on a defected graphene lattice can be manipulated by straining the graphene lattice . in that case",
    ", the predicted mae is between 0.4 and 2 mev .",
    "so , in the present case , it is interesting to study the effect of soc induced changes in magnetism of the fe impurities .",

    "this volume is equal to the volume of an equivalent graphane system .",
    "this is similar to the experimental situation where graphene nanoribbons are designed in a graphane sheet with fixed boundary .",
    "we have tested the influence of the cell relaxation and have found that the lattice parameter is decreased by less than 1@xmath4 , which is insignificant for our present discussion .",

    "we begin by presenting the results of a single fe atom placed on three different widths of these channels .",
    "it is known that for pristine graphene , the energetically favorable position of an fe atom is at the hollow site of the hexagonal ring with an fe to carbon distance of 2.1   . @xcite our calculations show that the minimum energy position of fe is dependent on the type of channel . for the armchair channel",

    "interestingly there is an induced up spin density in between the carbon atoms of fe surrounding ring .",

    "in contrast to the armchair channel , the dos for the edge channel ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fe1-edge](a ) ) shows a finite dos near the fermi energy .",
    "this is mainly because of spin - down electrons from the fe site and bare c sites with peaks below and above the fermi energy .",
    "the detailed examination of site and angular momentum projected dos shows that the down spin peak just below the fermi energy comes from both fe @xmath28 orbitals and the @xmath17 orbitals of the interface bare carbon atoms . the contribution in up spin peak just below the fermi energy is from delocalized @xmath17 orbitals of edge bare c atoms as well as a small contribution coming from @xmath23 bonded c atoms surrounding the fe atom .    our analysis",
    "also show that the effect of magnetic impurity is felt up to 4th nearest neighbor interface c atoms .",
    "it reduces the on - site magnetic moments on edge c atoms and the maximum reduction is @xmath19 15% on the nearest site .",
    "this is a sharp contrast compared to the armchair channel where the fe impurity affects only up to 1st nearest neighbor .",
    "another interesting difference is in the induced spin density on the hexagonal c ring nearest to fe . in the present case",
    "this ring is not anti - ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "only three c atoms ( belonging to same sub lattice ) show significant down spin density ( see in fig .  [",
    "fig : fe1-edge]-(ii ) ) .",
    "this is understandable from the fact that the delocalized electron density present in the channel interacts with the fe atom .",
    "it reduces the amount of charge transfer from fe @xmath27 states to fe @xmath26 states , resulting in an increment of local magnetic moment on fe to @xmath29 .",
    "this also leads to a somewhat long ranged perturbation in the underlying c lattice .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we have included soc in the hamiltonian to calculate the orbital moments and magnetic anisotropy energies for the case of 3-rows wide armchair and zigzag channels with a single fe atom .",
    "the calculated orbital moment of the fe atom in the armchair channel is 0.09 @xmath30 , which is enhanced compared to the calculated value for bulk fe ( @xmath19 0.05 @xmath31 without orbital polarization ) in the bcc phase .",
    "this is expected due to the lowering of symmetry in the present case . however , the enhancement is not dramatic due to the strong crystal field produced by the c atoms in the hexagon to which fe is chemically bonded .",
    "the calculated easy axis of magnetization is in - plane with mae equal to 19 mev / fe .",
    "this strong magnetic anisotropy should hold the fe moment in the plane of the substrate .",
    "the orbital moment along the 001 direction ( hard axis ) is 0.02 @xmath30 , consistent with the fact that the orbital moment is reduced along the hard axis .",
    "we have observed an interesting effect in the case of the zigzag channel . in the presence of soc ,",
    "some of the c atoms have spin moments of the order of 0.1 @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the total moment of the unit cell in much increased ( 4.5 @xmath30 ) compared to the case without soc .",
    "although the fe spin moment stays more or less the same , the additive contribution from c atoms gives rise to this enhancement of the total moment .",
    "also , in the case of zigzag channel , the mae is smaller ( @xmath19 4 mev / fe ) with an in - plane easy axis .",
    "the in - plane orbital moment amounts to 0.1 @xmath30 , which is slightly larger than the out - of - plane moment ( 0.08 @xmath30 ) the topic on the magnetic anisotropy of adatoms on graphene and the tuning of mae with an electric field has been discussed very recently .",
    "@xcite      now we will discuss the case of two interacting fe impurities .",
    "as expected , it turns out that the response of the channel electrons are different for the armchair and zigzag channels .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] shows the binding energy of fe atoms , total magnetic moment , on - site magnetic moment on fe atoms and exchange energies ( wherever possible ) . for armchair channel",
    "we have considered two possible fe - fe distances for all the channel widths . in this channel",

    "although the individual magnetic moment on fe atoms are similar and of the order of 2.5 @xmath16 , the total magnetic moment reduces from 7.0 @xmath16 ( 3-rows ) to 4.14 @xmath16 and 4.07 @xmath16 for the 5-rows and the 7-rows channels respectively . in this case the specific position of 2nd fe atom induces negative spin densities on the surrounding c atoms which in turns affect the spin densities of both edge row c atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all - spin ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the channel becomes ferromagnetically coupled across the edges and develops a large total magnetic moment .",
    "for the larger widths , as the fe atoms are placed nearest to one edge , the interaction between the fe atoms and the other edge is much weakened .",
    "therefore the edges remain weakly anti - ferromagnetically coupled reducing the total magnetic moment .",
    "as expected , the exchange energy @xmath32 is stronger for the smallest fe - fe distance ( 2.17 ) for all the widths ( see table .  [ tab2 ] ) . for 3-rows width , as the fe - fe distance increases , the exchange energy value decreases to 0.038 ev . thus there is a stable ferromagnetic state for all the fe - fe distance with possible transition temperature @xmath19 350 k. however it was not possible to estimate @xmath32 in other widths because we could not get properly converged anti - ferromagnetically state for longer fe - fe distances .    from the above discussions , it is evident that for the zigzag channel , the magnetic atoms interact strongly .",
    "thus one can envisage to achieve a magnetic graphane lattice by depositing magnetic atoms ( fe in the present case ) in the metallic channel of bare carbon atoms .",
    "indeed our preliminary calculations shows that it is possible to obtain stable linear fe chain by placing fe atoms nearest to the interface of the zigzag channel . the total magnetic moment and",
    "the binding energy was found to be 2.42 @xmath16/fe atom and 2.14 ev / fe atom respectively .",
    "it may be possible to form novel magnetic nanostructures ( chains , islands etc . ) with the help of scanning tunneling microscopic tips and study magnetism as a function of the width of the bare carbon channels .",
    "therefore , an ultrathin device with novel functionalities may be achieved .",
    "in conclusion , our detailed density functional investigations have revealed some novel electronic and magnetic response of single and a pair of fe atoms placed in patterned dehydrogenated channels in graphane .",
    "our work shows that the response of the two channels  the `` armchair '' and the `` zigzag '' channels are different . in the armchair channel , the magnetic response of the single fe atom",
    "is localized in nature while for the zigzag channel it is fairly long ranged .",
    "the easy axis of magnetization is in the plane of graphene with a large magnetic anisotropy energy of 19 mev / fe atom in the case of the armchair channel .",
    "as compared to armchair channel , the binding energies and the total magnetic moments with two fe impurities are distance dependent in the zigzag channel suggesting that the pair of fe atoms are rather strongly interacting in this channel .",
    "the magnetic coupling between a pair of fe atoms is very weakly ferromagnetic in the semiconducting armchair channel whereas a relatively stronger ferromagnetic coupling is observed for the closest separation between the fe atoms in the delocalized zigzag channel .",
    "our result for the armchair channel with two fe atoms shows a possibility of having a novel spin gapless semiconductor material by doping appropriate magnetic impurities in partially hydrogenated graphene of a particular width .",
    "the magnetic interaction between the impurities in partially hydrogenated graphene with conducting channels shows an oscillating ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic coupling across the edge of the channel for a particular width of zigzag channel .",
