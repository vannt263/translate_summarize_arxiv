    "lately there have been some renewed interest in the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory of gravitation @xcite .",
    "on one hand , it is important for cosmological inflation models @xcite , in which the scalar field allows the inflationary epoch to end via bubble nucleation without the need for fine - tuning cosmological parameters ( the `` graceful exit '' problem ) .",
    "also , it was found that in the low - energy regime , the theory of fundamental strings can be reduced to an effective bd one @xcite .    because scalar - tensor gravitation can agree with general relativity ( gr ) in the post - newtonian limit",
    ", it is important to study strong field examples in which the two theories may give different predictions .",
    "these examples may not only provide further experimental and observational tests that might distinguish between gr and scalar - tensor gravitation , but they may also illuminate the structure of both theories .    the bd theory incorporates the mach principle , which states that the phenomenon of inertia must arise from accelerations with respect to the general mass distribution of the universe .",
    "this theory is self - consistent , complete and for @xmath0 in accord with solar system observations and experiments @xcite , where @xmath1 is an adjustable parameter . in this theory , the matter couples minimally to the metric and not directly to scalar field .",
    "indeed , the scalar field does not exert any direct influence on matter , its only role is that of participating in the field equations that determine the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "more recently , many authors have investigated the gravitational collapse and black hole formation in the bd theory @xcite .",
    "till now , nonlinear charged rotating black hole solutions for an arbitrary value of @xmath1 has not been constructed . in this paper , we want to construct exact rotating black brane solutions in bd - born - infeld ( bdbi ) theory for an arbitrary value of @xmath1 and investigate their properties .",
    "one can find that solving the field equations directly is a non - trivial task , because they include the second derivatives of the scalar field .",
    "we remove this difficulty through a conformal transformation . by using this transformation",
    ", the bdbi action reduce to einstein - born - infeld - dilaton ( ebid ) action , and one can solve their field equations analytically .",
    "the idea of the non - linear electrodynamics ( bi ) was first introduced in @xmath2 by born and infeld in order to obtain a finite value for the self - energy of point - like charges @xcite .",
    "although it become less popular with the introduction of qed , in recent years , the bi action has been occurring repeatedly with the development of superstring theory , where the dynamics of @xmath3-branes is governed by the bi action @xcite .",
    "lately , black hole solutions in bi gravity with or without a cosmological constant have been considered by many authors @xcite .",
    "both of the lagrangians of ebid gravity presented here and in @xcite show similar asymptotic behavior but only the one we considered is consistent with bd theory .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions in the higher dimensional brans - dicke - born - infeld theory and investigate their properties . solving the field equations </S>",
    "<S> directly is a non - trivial task because they include the second derivatives of the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we remove this difficulty through a conformal transformation . </S>",
    "<S> also , we find that the suitable lagrangian of einstein - born - infeld - dilaton gravity is not the same as presented in @xcite . we show that the given solutions can present black brane , with inner and outer event horizons , an extreme black brane or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen suitably . </S>",
    "<S> these black brane solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter </S>",
    "<S> . then we calculate finite euclidean action , the conserved and thermodynamic quantities through the use of counterterm method . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we argue that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics , and the entropy does not follow the area law . </S>"
