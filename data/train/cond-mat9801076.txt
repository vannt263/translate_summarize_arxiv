    "growing amount of experimental data indicates that many of high - temperature and heavy - fermion superconductors have highly anisotropic order parameter on the fermi surface . the possibility for the order parameter to have opposite signs in different regions on the fermi surface , lines of nodes between those regions ( and , possibly",
    ", point nodes too ) has attracted much attention .",
    "since the presence of nodes of the order parameter leads to the existence of low - energy excitations in spectrum , this strongly modifies low - temperature behavior of thermodynamic and transport characteristics both in the absence and under the applied magnetic field (  see reviews@xcite and for more recent literature , for example,@xcite  ) . for these reasons measurements of temperature and magnetic field dependences of those characteristics",
    "are important experimental tools for probe the anisotropic structure of the order parameter@xcite .",
    "as compared to thermodynamic characteristics like specific heat , an important advantage of studying transport properties , in particular , the thermal conductivity is that it is a directional probe , sensitive to relative orientations of the thermal flow , the magnetic field and directions to nodes of the order parameter .    for isotropic @xmath6-wave superconductors low temperatures",
    "are obviously defined as satisfying the condition @xmath7 , when the number of quasiparticles thermally activated above the gap is exponentially small . in the presence of nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface an additional small energy scale @xmath8 appears , describing the bandwidth of impurity - induced quasiparticle bound states .",
    "then the low - temperature region should be divided into two parts . for temperatures @xmath9 transport properties",
    "are dominated by bound states .",
    "non - zero density of these states on the fermi surface results in linear temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity in this case . at the same time under the condition @xmath10 , which can be satisfied for sufficiently clean superconductors , one can disregard the influence of bound states",
    ". then the presence of nodes of the order parameter leads to characteristic higher order power - law behaviors of the thermal conductivity with temperature@xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of @xmath6-wave isotropic superconductors in the presence of the applied magnetic field exhibits nonmonotonous dependence upon the field@xcite . in high fields",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath11 rises rapidly due to suppression of the order parameter as the magnetic field approaches @xmath12 . at low fields @xmath11 decreases with increasing magnetic field",
    "this phenomenon is usually attributed to the scattering of electrons ( or / and phonons ) by the fluxoids , which was theoretically considered in@xcite . however , in isotropic @xmath6-wave superconductors at low temperatures the number of quasiparticles thermally activated into scattering states are exponentially small , so that the contribution to the thermal conduction along the magnetic field from bound states within the vortex cores become essential .",
    "in contrast to isotropic superconductors , for anisotropically paired superconductors with nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface , the intervortex space can dominate thermodynamic and transport characteristics at low temperatures due to low energy excitations with momentum directions near the nodes@xcite . under these conditions",
    "the characteristics usually become quite sensitive to the applied magnetic field even if it is of relatively small value . for example , quasiparticle density of states on the fermi surface for clean superconductors with nodes , takes nonzero value just due to the applied magnetic field (  as well as impurities  ) . since low - temperature behavior of thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat",
    "is directly associated with the behavior of the density of states on the fermi surface @xmath13 , this is the reason for their sensitivity to the magnetic field@xcite . for transport characteristics",
    "additional quantities are of importance in this respect",
    ". these are scattering relaxation times for various channels .",
    "for instance , it is known that the relaxation time @xmath14 at sufficiently low energies for elastic impurity scattering in clean superconductors with nodes , may be quite small for unitary scatterers and extremely large in the case of born scatterers@xcite . while @xmath14 for born scatterers is directly associated with @xmath15 , in the unitary limit @xmath14 , as a function of energy ,",
    "is not reduced entirely to the density of states and should be considered as an independent quantity .    below",
    "we show that for anisotropically paired clean superconductors with nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface , at low temperatures there is important additional mechanism for nonmonotonous dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity upon the magnetic field .",
    "this mechanism is associated with the electronic contribution to @xmath11 mostly from the intervortex space due to the presence there of extended quasiparticle states of low energies with momentum directions near nodes of the order parameter .",
    "contrary to isotropic @xmath6-wave superconductors , the main effect comes in this case from the influence of condensate flow field ( even of relatively small value ) on the quasiparticle impurity scattering in the unitary limit , rather than from scattering of quasiparticles directly on vortex cores .",
    "for these two types of scattering inverse relaxation times could be added under certain conditions@xcite .",
    "however , the contribution from scattering of quasiparticles by vortex cores is supposed to be negligibly small under the conditions considered below , as compared to the one from scattering by impurities in the intervortex space .    in the unitary limit relaxation time for scattering by nonmagnetic impurities of low - energy quasiparticles ,",
    "is found below to be a nonmonotonous function upon the condensate flow field .",
    "this takes place even for uniform superfluid flow , that is in the absence of any scattering by vortices .",
    "furthermore , for type ii superconductors with large ginzburg - landau parameter , the superflow induced by magnetic field in the intervortex space can be considered on sufficiently large distances from vortex cores ( much greater than the coherence length ) as quasihomogeneous flow .",
    "this allows one to consider approximately the thermal conductivity as a function of the local value of condensate flow field , as this would be for the uniform flow .",
    "magnetic field dependence of the thermal conductivity obtained in the first approximation as spatial averaging of the result over the intervortex space , is found below to be nonmonotonous under certain conditions .",
    "this effect can be important , in particular , for the analysis of recently observed nonmonotonous behavior of the thermal conductivity in @xmath1 , since the electronic contribution to @xmath0 is known to dominate there below 1k@xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath16 phases both for the @xmath2 representation and for the @xmath5 one as candidates for the type of superconducting pairing in @xmath1 at low temperatures and under the weak applied magnetic field @xmath17 ( see , for example,@xcite ) .",
    "our theoretical results , basing on this consideration , are in a qualitative agreement with those experimentally observed in@xcite .",
    "mostly the both models give rise to such an agreement .",
    "the difference between corresponding predictions is not too great , although it is of importance permitting to distinguish between them .",
    "recent experimental data@xcite , in particular , allow for determining the low - temperature interval , where the power law temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity takes place .",
    "we find , that the behavior of the zero - field anisotropy ratio for the thermal conductivity for these temperatures seems to indicate in favor of @xmath2 type of pairing . at higher temperatures",
    "the behavior of the thermal conductivity becomes essentially depending upon the particular form of the order parameter all over the fermi surface , not only near its nodes . under this condition",
    "there are various possibilities to fit experimental data within the framework of both models , so that the problem to distinguish between them becomes ambiguous one@xcite .",
    "by contrast , at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath18 the behavior of the thermal conductivity is governed mainly by the behavior of the order parameter near nodes , as well as by the strength of scatterers .",
    "this leads , in principle , to the possibility to identify the behavior near the nodes and , hence , the type of superconducting pairing , but not a particular form of the order parameter all over the fermi surface .",
    "this circumstance was already emphasized earlier in@xcite , where the accent was made on the ultra low temperatures @xmath19 . quite a small value @xmath20 taking place for clean samples of ref .",
    "give the possibility to determine and concentrate on the low - temperature region @xmath21 , while the ultra low temperatures in this case seem not to be sufficiently studied experimentally yet .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "basic equations are listed in the next section .",
    "we consider clean superconductors at low temperatures under the applied magnetic field (  @xmath22  ) and disregard the contribution from impurity bound states up to sec.6 . in sec.3",
    "we determine the nonmonotony of the relaxation time in the unitary limit .",
    "it is shown , that for the energy dominating regime @xmath23 the relaxation time @xmath24 decreases with increasing superflow in the presence of the line of nodes of the order parameter , in contrast to the case of superflow dominating condition @xmath25 , when the relaxation time rises .",
    "analytical calculations are carried out for sufficiently small quantities @xmath26 . in sec.4 the thermal conduction as a function of the superflow as well as along the applied magnetic field",
    "is analyzed .",
    "we examine three important examples of anisotropic gap functions : the polar state and ( 1,i ) superconducting states for @xmath5 and @xmath2 types of superconducting pairing in hexagonal crystals (  like @xmath1  ) .",
    "we find that in the temperature dominating region @xmath27 the thermal conductivity diminishes with the magnetic field for all three types of pairing considered , if the magnetic field is applied within the basal plane .",
    "this turns out to be valid as well for @xmath28 and the magnetic field along @xmath29-axis ( of high symmetry ) for @xmath5 and @xmath2 types of pairing , not for the polar state .",
    "the contribution to the magnetic field dependence of @xmath0 from the intervortex space @xmath30 dominates in this case , which justifies the semiclassical approximation we use . for higher fields or lower temperatures",
    "the thermal conductivity always rises with the increasing magnetic field , although in this case intervortex space dominates only for the magnetic field oriented within the basal plane .",
    "this ensures the nonmonotonous magnetic field dependence of @xmath0 (  at least for @xmath2 and @xmath5 models  ) under the condition @xmath31 , where numerical factor @xmath32 may be of the order of unity . in sec.5 the low - temperature behavior of the thermal conductivity in zero field and the magnetic field dependence of @xmath33 at low fields and low temperatures are studied in clean limit ( the @xmath34-th axis is aligned along the magnetic field ) .",
    "we show for the temperature region @xmath35 , that scaling of the thermal conductivity with a single parameter @xmath3 at low fields and low temperatures ( both for @xmath36 and for @xmath37 ) as well as weak low - temperature dependence of the anisotropy ratio @xmath4 in zero field , are approximately valid in clean limit for @xmath16-phase of @xmath2-type of pairing .",
    "qualitatively it is quite close to what it is observed experimentally for @xmath1 in@xcite . under the same conditions @xmath5 model results in more noticeable deviations from the scaling , and in essential temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "new test is suggested for discrimination between candidates for the type of pairing in @xmath1 , based on the dependence of @xmath28 upon the value of transport supercurrent flowing in thin films or whyskers along the hexagonal axis in the absence of the magnetic field . in sec.6",
    "we describe the behavior of the thermal conductivity under the condition @xmath39 , when contribution from impurity bound states dominates the thermal conductivity .",
    "we find in this limit , that the thermal conductivity monotonously decreases with increasing condensate flow field ( at least for @xmath40 ) and does not satisfy the above - mentioned scaling behavior .",
    "this is also in agreement with the experimental results for @xmath1 .",
    "taking into account influence of the magnetic field ( satisfying the condition @xmath41 ) on the thermal conductivity , we are interested in the contribution from large distances from vortex cores ( @xmath42 ) , where the problem can be considered approximately as locally quasihomogeneous one on the basis of semiclassical approximation@xcite .",
    "being justified for those cases , when the contribution from the intervortex space @xmath43 turns out to be dominating , such an approach simplifies greatly all analytical considerations permitting to obtain correct results up to numerical coefficients of the order of unity . besides , we assume the particle - hole symmetry and consider superconducting states to be unitary : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 unit matrix . then the expression for the thermal conductivity under the applied magnetic field can be written in the form @xmath47 @xmath48 here",
    "@xmath49 is the gauge - invariant condensate flow field induced by the magnetic field ( see , for example,@xcite ; @xmath50 is the phase of the order parameter ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the quasiparticle energy and the order parameter renormalized by impurities ; notation @xmath53 means the averaging over the fermi surface .",
    "further we ignore contributions to the quasiparticle group velocity due to the momentum direction dependence of the order parameter , since for small enough parameter @xmath54 this would lead to a quite small corrections to the thermal conductivity@xcite . also we assume below for simplicity a spherical fermi surface and introduce the superfluid velocity @xmath55 , so that under this simplification @xmath56 .",
    "the branch of square root function in ( [ kappaij ] ) should be chosen to have nonnegative imaginary part .",
    "considering sufficiently clean superconductors in the temperature region @xmath57 , one can disregard the contribution from impurity bound states .",
    "then eq.([kappaij ] ) reduces to @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the thermal conductivity in the normal state at @xmath60 ; @xmath14 and @xmath61 are relaxation times for quasiparticle scattering on impurities in superconducting and normal - metal states respectively . the quantity @xmath62 in the case of spherical fermi surface is defined as follows @xmath63    assuming particle - hole symmetry",

    "for the chosen branch of square root function the real part of the integrand in ( [ g0 ] ) ( that is the density of states ) is a nonnegative quantity .",
    "let us consider superconducting phases with order parameters having line of nodes in the equatorial plane on a ( spherical ) fermi surface , and the applied magnetic field satisfying the condition @xmath17 and aligned along the crystalline axis of high symmetry ( @xmath29-axis ) .",
    "as particular examples , there may be the polar phase and @xmath16-superconducting phases of @xmath5- and @xmath2-types of pairing in hexagonal superconductors .",
    "last two phases are widely discussed as candidates for the type of superconducting pairing taking place in the heavy fermion superconductor @xmath1@xcite .",
    "all these particular order parameters change their signs under the reflection across the equatorial plane on the fermi surface : @xmath70 . due to this property function",
    "@xmath67 is equal to zero for the magnetic field parallel to @xmath29-axis .",
    "the applied magnetic field influences the relaxation time mainly due to its dependence upon the superflow , induced by the field and aligned in the particular case parallel to the basal plane . in calculating the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath14 upon the superflow under the condition @xmath71 ,",
    "it is essential that only narrow regions near nodes of the order parameter on the fermi surface govern the dependence of @xmath72 upon the superfluid velocity . at the same time",
    "the quantity @xmath73 , generally speaking , is formed by the whole fermi surface .",
    "we assume that the order parameter near the line of nodes ( @xmath74 ) may be represented as @xmath75 , while near the point node on one of the poles ( @xmath76 ) it has the form @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "calculations show , that if one keeps terms up to @xmath79 in the expansion in powers of the superfluid velocity , taking into account as well the first power of small parameter @xmath80 , then contributions from the line of nodes and quadratic points are essential . at the same time contributions from linear points",
    "may be neglected as compared to ones from the line of nodes . as a result",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the relaxation time in the unitarity limit @xmath81 @xmath82 ^ 2 \\enspace , \\qquad p_fv_s\\le \\omega \\ll \\delta_{max } \\enspace , \\label{tau1}\\ ] ]    @xmath83 @xmath84    the most important feature of the dependence upon the superflow , describing by eqs.([tau1 ] ) , ( [ tau2 ] ) , is its nonmonotonous behavior .",
    "indeed , one can easily see under the conditions @xmath85 , that the relaxation time decreases with the increasing superfluid velocity according to the relation @xmath86 @xmath87    at the same time under the opposite condition @xmath88 we see from ( [ tau2 ] ) , that @xmath89 increases linearly with the parameter @xmath90 .",

    "the relaxation time is described by the relation@xcite @xmath103 and may manifest nonmonotonous magnetic field dependence ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "nonmonotony of the relaxation time as a function of the applied magnetic field may take place for various orientations of the field , due to the same reasons as for the field parallel to the @xmath29-axis . in this subsection",
    "we present shortly some results on magnetic field dependence of relaxation time for the field lying within the basal plane for polar phase @xmath104 , @xmath16-phase of @xmath5-representation of @xmath105 point group @xmath106 , and @xmath16-phase of @xmath2-representation @xmath107 .",

    "let the magnetic field be aligned firstly along the @xmath29-axis , so that the supercurrent flows parallel to the basal plane .    for low temperatures and small superfluid velocities satisfying the conditions @xmath126  , there are two characteristic regions @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where dependences of the thermal conductivity upon @xmath121 may differ essentially .",
    "while within the region @xmath128 the thermal conductivity always rises with increasing @xmath121 , it may be possible both increase or decrease under the condition @xmath129 . thus , nonmonotonous behavior of the relaxation time may result in respective nonmonotonous dependence of the thermal conductivity upon the superflow ( and eventually upon the magnetic field ) . however , nonmonotony is not a inevitable consequence for the thermal conductivity , which would be valid for any types of pairing in the presence of such a behavior of the relaxation time .",

    "it is important , however , that the contribution from linear point nodes in this limit is evidently less than from the line of nodes . at the same time",

    "we found that the contribution from low energy quasiparticles in the intervortex space is quite important in this respect and specific for superconductors with nodes .",
    "the effect comes from the influence of condensate flow field in the intervortex space on the scattering by nonmagnetic impurities of low - energy extended quasiparticles with momentum directions near nodes of the order parameter .",
    "the scattering is considered to be sufficiently close to the unitarity limit .",
    "we showed that the relaxation time at low energy is a nonmonotonous function upon the condensate flow field .",
    "nonmonotonous magnetic field dependence of the thermal conductivity due to this contribution may take place for type ii superconductors with large ginzburg - landau parameter within the temperature interval @xmath315 , where numerical factor @xmath32 may be of the order of unity .",
    "these results are in a good qualitative agreement with recent experiments@xcite on the heavy - fermion superconductor @xmath1 .",
    "we explain the anomalously strong influence of the magnetic field on the quasiparticle scattering , observing in this compound@xcite .",
    "we obtained as well that scaling behavior of the thermal conductivity with a single parameter @xmath3 as well as weak low - temperature dependence of the anisotropy ratio @xmath4 in zero field , are valid with logarithmic accuracy within the temperature interval @xmath259 for @xmath16-phase of @xmath2-type of pairing .",
    "qualitatively it is quite close to that observed for @xmath1 in ref .. under the same conditions @xmath5 model results in more noticeable deviations from the scaling , and in essential temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "new test is proposed for discrimination between candidates for the type of pairing in @xmath1 , based on the dependence of @xmath28 upon the value of transport supercurrent flowing in thin films or whyskers along the hexagonal axis .",

    "the effect of the supercurrent flow on the relaxation time and on the thermal conductivity for superconductors with nodes was discussed about ten years ago in@xcite .",

    ". then the basic formula of@xcite for the thermal conductivity in the presence of the supercurrent reduces to our relation ( [ thc ] ) .",
    "note , that when the relaxation time by impurities is associated with one - particle propagator ( see , for example@xcite ) , the processes of quasiparticle scattering and of the pair creation and annihilation by impurities are automatically considered together , and there is no need to separate them as it is done in@xcite .",
