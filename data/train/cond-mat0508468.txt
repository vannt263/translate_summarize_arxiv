    "there continues to be a controversy about the nature of the ising spin glass .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick model,@xcite with its infinite - range interactions between the spins , is described by the parisi replica - symmetry breaking mean - field theory.@xcite to understand models with short - range interactions on finite - dimensional lattices , however , it is necessary to include the effects of interfaces , which do not exist in a well - defined way in an infinite - range model .",
    "the droplet model of fisher and huse,@xcite which starts from the domain - wall renormalization group ideas of mcmillan@xcite and bray and moore,@xcite and studies the properties of interfaces , provides a very different viewpoint on the spin - glass phase .",
    "more recently , numerical results@xcite indicate that the actual situation for three - dimensional ( 3d ) models combines elements of both pictures in a nontrivial way .    in two dimensions ( 2d ) ,",
    "the spin - glass phase is not stable at finite temperature .",
    "because of this , it is necessary to treat cases with continuous distributions of energies ( cde ) and cases with quantized distributions of energies ( qde ) separately.@xcite    in three or more space dimensions , where a spin - glass phase is believed to occur at finite temperature , the general framework of thermodynamics requires that the cde and the qde should be treated on the same footing .",
    "the way this comes about is that in these cases the typical domain wall energy increases as a positive power of the size of the lattice .",
    "thus the quantization energy becomes a negligible fraction of the domain wall energy for large lattices .",
    "all bond distributions behave in a qualitatively similar way , except that the qde have finite ground state entropies.@xcite    amoruso , hartmann , hastings and moore@xcite have recently proposed that in 2d there is a relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fractal dimension of domain walls , and @xmath10 is the exponent which characterizes the scaling of the domain wall energy with size . for continuous energy distributions the existing numerical estimates of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "satisfy eqn .",
    "it is known from the droplet theory,@xcite that for the qde , which have a positive entropy at zero temperature , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the exponent for the scaling of domain wall entropy with size .",
    "thus , for the qde , eqn .",
    "( 1 ) provides a relation between the scaling of the energy and the entropy of domain walls .",
    "it is not known how to calculate @xmath9 directly for the qde case , so we need to use eqn .",
    "( 2 ) to verify eqn . ( 1 ) in that case .    for the qde",
    ", it is known that @xmath13.@xcite then using eqn .",
    "( 1 ) gives @xmath14 , or using eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath15 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath12 by saul and kardar,@xcite found @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath9 can not be less than 1 , this result was interpreted as a strong indication that @xmath17 .    in this work",
    "we will demonstrate that eqn .",
    "( 1 ) actually _ does _ work for both continuous and quantized distributions in 2d .",
    "the actual behavior of the qde probability distributions under finite - size scaling turns out to be more subtle than what has been assumed until recently.@xcite as pointed out by wang , harrington and preskill,@xcite domain walls of zero energy which cross the entire sample play a special role when the energy is quantized .",
    "we will analyze data for the domain wall energy , @xmath3 , and the domain wall entropy , @xmath4 , for the ground states ( gs ) of 2d ising spin glasses obtained using methods from earlier work.@xcite we will demonstrate that for @xmath18 square lattices the edwards - anderson@xcite ( ea ) model with a @xmath19 bond distribution has a strong correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the gs domain walls .",
    "because of this correlation , we will need to treat domain walls of different energies as distinct classes , whose entropies scale in different ways as @xmath20 is increased .",
    "we will find that the scaling parameter identified by saul and kardar@xcite is the one associated with domain walls having @xmath6 .",
    "it is not , however , the one which controls the dominant behavior for large @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ea model for ising spins is @xmath21 where each spin @xmath22 is a dynamical variable which has two allowed states , + 1 and -1 .",
    "the @xmath23 indicates a sum over nearest neighbors on a simple square lattice of size @xmath18 .",
    "we choose each bond @xmath24 to be an independent identically distributed quenched random variable , with the probability distribution @xmath25 so that we actually set @xmath26 , as usual .",
    "thus @xmath2 is the concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds , and @xmath27 is the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds .    the data analyzed here used an ensemble in which , for a given value of @xmath2 , every @xmath0 random lattice sample had exactly @xmath28 positive bonds and @xmath29 negative bonds .",
    "details of the methods used to calculate the gs energies and the numbers of gs have been described earlier,@xcite and the data analyzed here were used before to obtain other properties of the model.@xcite",
    "the gs entropy is defined as the natural logarithm of the number of ground states . for each sample",
    "the gs energy and gs entropy were calculated for the four combinations of periodic ( p ) and antiperiodic ( a ) toroidal boundary conditions along each of the two axes of the square lattice.@xcite we will refer to these as pp , pa , ap and aa . in the spin - glass region of the phase diagram , the variation of the sample properties for changes of the boundary conditions is small compared to the variation between different samples of the same size,@xcite except when @xmath2 is close to the ferromagnetic phase boundary and the ferromagnetic correlation length becomes comparable to @xmath20 .",
    "we define domain walls for the spin glass as it was done in the seminal work of mcmillan.@xcite we look at differences between two samples with the same set of bonds , and the same boundary conditions in one direction , but different boundary conditions in the other direction .",
    "thus , for each set of bonds we obtain domain wall data from the four pairs ( pp , pa ) , ( pp , ap ) , ( aa , pa ) and ( aa , ap )",
    ". the reader should remember that the term  domain wall \" , as used in this work , refers only to this procedure .",
    "saul and kardar@xcite follow the same procedure used in this work , but use the term  defect \" instead of  domain wall \" .",
    "it is important to realize that the meaning of a domain wall is very different when the gs entropy is positive , as in the model we study here , as compared to the standard case of a doubly degenerate ground state . in the standard case",
    "one can identify a line of bonds which forms a boundary between regions of spins belonging to the two different ground states .",
    "it is not possible to do that when there are many ground states . despite this",
    ", we continue to use the term  domain wall \" .    due to the @xmath30 we have chosen and the fact that we have only used even values of @xmath20 , the energy is always a multiple of 4 .",
    "thus , the energy difference , @xmath3 , for any pair must also be a multiple of 4 .",
    "the sign of @xmath3 for a pair is essentially arbitrary for the values of @xmath2 we will study here , which are deep in the spin - glass region of the phase diagram .",
    "thus we can , without loss of generality , choose all of the domain - wall energies to be non - negative .",
    "for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , it turns out , crudely speaking , that about 75% of the time we find @xmath6 , and 25% of the time @xmath5 . for a given @xmath20 ,",
    "the fraction of @xmath6 domain walls , @xmath33 , is about 3% higher at @xmath32 than at @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to note that wang , harrington and preskill@xcite use an analytical argument to predict that @xmath33 is approximately 0.75 , independent of @xmath2 , in the spin - glass regime .",
    "the value of @xmath33 tends to increase slightly as @xmath20 increases , but our statistical errors are too large for a good estimate of the finite - size scaling behavior to be made .",
    "our results for @xmath32 are consistent with the results of amoruso _",
    "et al._@xcite    our calculated statistics for these values of @xmath2 , as a function of @xmath20 , are given in table i and table ii .",
    "estimating the statistical uncertainties in these numbers is not trivial , due to the fact that the values of @xmath3 obtained from the same set of bonds with the four different pairs of boundary conditions are not statistically independent .",
    "an upper bound on the statistical uncertainties is obtained by counting the number of samples , rather than the number of pairs .",
    "no domain walls with energies greater than 8 were observed at any @xmath20 for these values of @xmath2 .",
    "this , however , does not have much fundamental significance .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath3 is also a function of the aspect ratio of the lattice.@xcite    .[tab : table1]domain wall energy statistics for @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the number of negative bonds in each sample , and @xmath36 is the number of distinct bond configurations studied for a given @xmath20 and @xmath35 .",

    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the domain wall entropy , @xmath4 , is defined , by analogy to @xmath3 , to be the difference in the gs entropy when the boundary condition is changed along one direction from p to a , with the boundary condition in the other direction remaining fixed .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath4 for the cases where @xmath6 should be symmetric about 0 , and our statistics are consistent with this . as shown by saul and kardar,@xcite the variance of @xmath4 when @xmath6 increases with @xmath20 in approximately a linear fashion .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , for both @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the calculated skewness of these essentially symmetric distributions is , naturally , consistent with zero , but their kurtosis is not . for @xmath40 the calculated kurtosis for different values of @xmath20 varies between 1.0 and 2.5 , with no apparent trend in the @xmath20 dependence . for @xmath41 , where the number of samples is about twice as large",
    ", the kurtosis varies between 1.35 and 2.05 , again without any apparent trend with @xmath20 .",
    "if we average over @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath42 for @xmath31 and @xmath43 for @xmath32 . from this",
    "we conclude that the @xmath6 distributions are not gaussian , and that they probably do not become gaussian even as @xmath20 becomes large .",
    "the results are consistent with a probability distribution which has a kurtosis of about 1.7 , independent of @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the model is critical at @xmath44 for both values of @xmath2 , this result is not surprising .",
    "variance of the entropy vs. @xmath20 for the @xmath6 domain walls , for the cases @xmath31 and @xmath45.,width=326 ]     average entropy vs. @xmath20 for the @xmath5 domain walls , for the cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 , log - log plot .",
    "the error bars indicate 1 @xmath46 , and the statistical errors are larger for @xmath31 because the numbers of samples are smaller.,width=326 ]    when @xmath3 is not zero , the relative signs of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not arbitrary . having chosen @xmath3 to be nonnegative , we then find that , when @xmath3 is positive , it turns out that @xmath4 is almost always positive . in fig .",
    "2 we show the behavior of the average value of @xmath4 for the cases where @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we see that for @xmath5 , the average value of @xmath47 grows approximately as @xmath48 , for both values of @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , a least - squares fit to the form @xmath49 gives @xmath50 for @xmath31 , and @xmath51 for @xmath32 .",
    "these numbers should be compared to the prediction of droplet theory,@xcite eqn .",
    "( 2 ) . because of the large gs degeneracy in the @xmath19 ising spin glass",
    ", one does not know how to compute @xmath9 directly for this model .    for the ising spin glass with a gaussian bond distribution",
    ", however , this calculation in 2d is straightforward , and the result@xcite is @xmath52",
    ". it would be desirable to improve the accuracy of our estimate of @xmath12 sufficiently to demonstrate that @xmath12 is really different for the cde and the qde , as predicted by eqn .",
    "the predicted numerical difference is small , however , so this will be difficult .",
    "the skewness and kurtosis of the @xmath4 distributions for @xmath5 are both small , in contrast to the @xmath6 case .",
    "it is likely that these distributions become gaussian in the large @xmath20 limit .",
    "average entropy divided by its standard deviation vs. @xmath20 for the @xmath5 domain walls , for the cases @xmath31 and @xmath32.,width=326 ]    the result of saul and kardar,@xcite obtained by looking at the distribution of @xmath4 for all values of @xmath3 combined , was @xmath16 . to obtain this exponent ,",
    "saul and kardar fit the data at small values of @xmath4 . for practical purposes ,",
    "this part of the data belongs to the @xmath6 component .",
    "it is clear that if our extrapolations from small @xmath20 are correct , however , eventually , at large enough @xmath20 , the width of the total @xmath4 distribution will be dominated by the @xmath5 component . although they did not identify it , the peak in the probability distribution of @xmath4 due to the @xmath5 component is clearly visible in fig .",
    "19 of the 1994 paper of saul and kardar.@xcite    in fig .",
    "3 we show the values of the ratio of average value of the @xmath53 distribution for @xmath5 divided by the rms width of the distribution . except for @xmath54 , where the ratios are smaller , we see that this ratio is about 2.9 for @xmath31 , and about 3.2 for @xmath32 .",
    "thus this characteristic of the distributions seems to depend on @xmath2 .",
    "however , it seems likely that the ratio is actually @xmath20-dependent , and that the large @xmath20 limit is universal , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "what we have learned is that in this model there are two distinct classes of domain walls , the @xmath6 domain walls and the @xmath55 domain walls . for @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the only type of @xmath55 domain walls which we need to worry about are the @xmath5 ones .",
    "if we wanted to study values of @xmath2 of 0.15 or less,@xcite or values of the aspect ratio less than one,@xcite then we would need to consider larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "it should be expected that these are qualitatively similar to the @xmath5 case , as explained below .",
    "as we have seen , the @xmath5 domain walls behave in a way which is essentially consistent with the predictions of the droplet model , but the @xmath6 domain walls do not .",
    "this difference in behavior can not be understood within the droplet model . it must be related to the special feature of the model caused by the quantization of the energy spectrum , which is the positive gs entropy .",
    "another fact which we need to use is the recently discovered result@xcite that the average gs entropy is an increasing function of the gs energy .    for an @xmath55 domain wall ,",
    "a contribution to @xmath4 comes from this shift in the average gs entropy with the shift in the gs energy .",
    "what remains to be understood is why @xmath4 should scale with increasing @xmath20 in the way predicted by the droplet model .",
    "the conventional derivation of the droplet model@xcite appears to use the assumption that the gs is unique , up to a reversal of the entire state , in an essential way .",
    "the extension of the droplet model to the more general case was given by fisher and huse.@xcite    as long as @xmath55 , the two boundary conditions which we are comparing are not on an equal footing .",
    "as wang , harrington and preskill@xcite express the situation , the @xmath55 domain wall does not destroy the topological long - range order .",
    "however , in the @xmath6 case the two boundary conditions are on an equal footing , and the topological order is destroyed . therefore the @xmath6 class of domain walls can be expected to behave in a special way , which differs from the prediction of the droplet model .",
    "it is well established that this model displays large corrections to finite - size scaling.@xcite the reader may object that nothing reliable about the large @xmath20 behavior can be learned from data which is restricted to @xmath1 . however , our results indicate that the reason for the large corrections to scaling is that the differences in the scaling exponents for different classes of domain walls is small . when each class is analyzed separately ,",
    "this effect is eliminated .",
    "thus , going out to only @xmath56 is not as bad as it might appear at first .",
    "a more significant limitation in our work is that the number of samples we have data for is much smaller than we would like .",
    "we also wish to point out that there is a natural similarity between the @xmath6 domain walls in the 2d ising spin glass with @xmath19 bonds and the large - scale low energy excitations which have been found@xcite in the three - dimensional version of the same model . a similar , and",
    "possibly related large - scale low energy excitation has also been seen in the 3d random - anisotropy xy model.@xcite similar ideas have also been discussed by hatano and gubernatis.@xcite    the domain - wall renormalization group of mcmillan@xcite is based on the idea that we are studying an effective coupling constant which is changing with @xmath20 . for the case of a continuous distribution of bonds , we can use the energy as the coupling constant . for the quantized energy case ,",
    "what we should really do is a slight generalization of this idea .",
    "we should think of the coupling constant as the free energy at some infinitesimal temperature .",
    "when we do this , the entropy contributes to the coupling constant . and",
    "as we have seen , the distribution of @xmath3 rapidly becomes essentially independent of @xmath20 as @xmath20 becomes large . under these conditions , it becomes natural to treat each value of @xmath3 as a separate class , representing a different coupling constant .",
    "therefore , since @xmath4 increases as a positive power of @xmath20 for @xmath5 , and presumably for all other ( finite ) positive values , this coupling constant must eventually be controlled by @xmath4 . and",
    "this coupling constant is also the one described by the droplet model .",
    "the @xmath6 class behaves differently , and therefore represents a different coupling constant .",
    "it is natural to wonder if topological long - range order can be related to replica - symmetry breaking , and if the @xmath6 domain walls can be described by the replica - symmetry breaking theory .",
    "we will not attempt to do this here .",
    "the argument that all classes other than the @xmath6 class behave in the same way should certainly be checked . the way to do",
    "this would be to do calculations with odd values of @xmath20.@xcite in this way we would obtain results for the @xmath57 class , and possibly also for the @xmath58 class .",
    "the computing effort used to obtain the results described here was rather modest by current standards .",
    "the algorithm@xcite is capable of generating data for greater numbers of samples out to somewhat larger values of @xmath20 ( perhaps to @xmath59 ) with a reasonable effort .",
    "the method of lukic _",
    "et al._@xcite appears to be more powerful , and has been used by them to generate energy - entropy statistics for ground states of this model out to @xmath60 .",
    "we have studied the statistics of domain walls for ground states of the 2d ising spin glass with + 1 and -1 bonds for @xmath0 square lattices with @xmath1 , and @xmath2 = 0.25 and 0.5 , where @xmath2 is the fraction of negative bonds , using periodic and/or antiperiodic boundary conditions . under these conditions ,",
    "almost all domain walls have an energy @xmath3 equal to 0 or 4 .",
    "the probability distribution of the entropy @xmath4 is found to depend strongly on @xmath3 .",
    "the results for @xmath4 when @xmath5 agree with the prediction of amoruso , hartmann , hastings and moore,@xcite eqn .",
    "( 1 ) . our results for @xmath4 when @xmath6 agree with those of saul and kardar,@xcite but in addition we find that the distributions are not gaussian in that case , even in the limit of large @xmath20 .",
    "due to the special role of the @xmath6 domain walls , we can understand the difference between the scaling exponent found by saul and kardar and the prediction of eqn .",
