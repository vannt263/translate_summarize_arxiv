    "moreover , the stronger the disorder , the more gradual the transition is from the patterned state to the zero uniform state .        to better understand the effects of the heterogeneous parameters on the dynamics and on the critical transition , we investigated the cross - correlations between the dynamical variable , @xmath16 , and the disordered parameter ( we present here the results for the disorder in @xmath2 , but similar results were obtained for the disorder in @xmath3 ) . because the system includes nonlocal terms , the cross - correlation is maximal when considering the average value of @xmath2 in the vicinity of each point .",
    "the length over which @xmath2 should be averaged is determined by the diffusion coefficient . in the appendix @xcite",
    ", we provide a more detailed analysis of the optimal averaging length .",
    "figure [ fig : cross ] presents the cross - correlations between @xmath16 and @xmath2 versus the bifurcation parameter .",
    "the left panel ( a ) corresponds to the full swift - hohenberg model ( eq . ) and different strengths of the disorder .",
    "the cross - correlation is almost constant away from the critical point , and it increases significantly as the system approaches the critical point .",
    "after the system collapses to the zero uniform state , it reaches zero , reflecting the fact that @xmath17 , regardless of the value of @xmath2 . in the right panel ( b ) , we present the same cross - correlation for a non - pattern forming system that was obtained by setting the coefficient of the fourth derivative to zero and changing the sign of the coefficient of the second derivative ( to ensure convergence of the system ) in eq . .",
    "this simplified system exhibits a bistability of two uniform states .",
    "the cross - correlation here is much higher than in the pattern - forming system , and it decreases to zero as the system undergoes the critical transition .",
    "no increase , or peak , is seen in this case .        to verify that the results presented above are not unique to the swift - hohenberg model and are applicable to other , more complex , pattern - forming systems , we consider , in the next section , a well - explored model describing the dynamics of dryland vegetation .",
    "spatially extended ecosystems are often heterogeneous at various scales . moreover , the environmental conditions vary due to climate dynamics and interactions with other ecosystems .",
    "much is known about regime shifts ( i.e. , critical transitions ) in homogeneous systems .",
    "the model studied in the next section will help us to shed light on the effects of the oft - neglected quenched disorder on the dynamics of pattern - forming ecosystems both close to and away from the critical points .",
    "to demonstrate the generality and the importance of the effects of quenched disorder on pattern - forming systems , we use the context of water - limited vegetation dynamics .",
    "vegetation patterns have been observed in many places around the world , including africa , australia , north and south america , and asia @xcite .",
    "vegetation pattern formation is commonly seen as a self - organization phenomenon due to competition for water and positive feedbacks .",
    "the positive feedbacks considered in different models include infiltration contrast , water uptake and root augmentation @xcite .",
    "the interplay between these feedbacks is highly non - trivial and affects the patterns formed by the vegetation @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the vegetation and the water variables is described by a set of nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "these models predict five basic vegetation states that are observed along a decreasing rainfall gradient  uniform vegetation cover , vegetation cover interspersed with gaps of bare soil , vegetation stripes , vegetation spots , and uniform bare soil @xcite  and the existence of a bistability range for each pair of consecutive states , e.g. , bistability of stripes and spots .",
    "the extensive research of vegetation models and the deep knowledge of these systems make them an ideal choice for the study of the effects of quenched disorder .",
    "the backgrounds for the vegetation patterns are the landscapes in which they occur .",
    "almost all soil in nature is heterogeneous .",
    "this heterogeneity arises from small changes in the soil texture and composition , the presence of small rocks and stones , micro - topography , changes in soil depth @xcite , changes in the slope , the spatial distribution of nutrients @xcite and many other factors @xcite .    , and the standard deviation is @xmath18 .",
    "the bare - soil state at a low precipitation rate and the uniform vegetation cover at a high precipitation rate are not shown . ]    to study the effect of quenched disorder , we used an extensively explored model for the dynamics of water - limited vegetation @xcite .",
    "the model describes the spatio - temporal dynamics of three variables : the areal densities of vegetation , @xmath19 , soil water , @xmath20 and surface water , @xmath21 .",
    "only one pattern - forming mechanism , the infiltration feedback , is captured by the model @xcite .",
    "the infiltration feedback represents the increased infiltration rate of surface water in vegetation patches , thereby increasing the local vegetation growth rate . in bare - soil areas , a biological soil crust tends to form , reducing the infiltration rate .",
    "in addition , the plant root systems increase the porosity of soil and , thus , the infiltration rate .",
    "the total amount of water is conserved , and therefore , the increased soil - water density in the vegetation patches inhibits the growth in bare areas .",
    "the combination of local positive feedbacks and long - range competition for water leads to a finite wavenumber instability of the uniform state and to the pattern formation .",
    "the model equations are :    [ rmodel ] @xmath22    the dynamics of the biomass density describes its soil - water - dependent growth rate , @xmath23 ( this form ensures a linear dependency at a low soil - water density and saturation of the growth rate at a high soil - water density ) , the natural mortality rate , @xmath24 , and its dispersal , by clonal growth or seed dispersion , which is characterized by the diffusion coefficient , @xmath25 .",
    "the soil - water density grows due to surface - water infiltration whose rate depends on the biomass density , @xmath26 . in patches of very high biomass density ( @xmath27 ) , the infiltration rate is @xmath28 , while in bare - soil domains , it is reduced by a factor @xmath29 ( the infiltration rate in bare - soil domains is @xmath30 ) .",
    "the soil - water density is reduced by the vegetation water uptake , whose rate is @xmath31 , and by the evaporation and drainage , whose rate is @xmath32 .",
    "the spatial dynamics of the soil water consists of a simple diffusion with diffusivity @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that the diffusivity of soil water varies significantly with the soil - water content ; however , for the temporal and spatial scales captured by the model , the description using a simple constant diffusivity is justified .",
    "the surface - water dynamics accounts for the precipitation rate , @xmath34 , the infiltration rate , @xmath35 , and the surface - water evaporation rate , @xmath36 ; for simplicity , we assume a plain topography in which the spatial dynamics of the surface water is described by simple diffusion with diffusivity @xmath37 . the disorder was introduced in the evaporation and drainage rate , @xmath32 .",
    "variability in the soil texture , depth , composition and nutrient content can significantly affect the drainage rate @xcite and motivates the use of this parameter as the disordered parameter . for simplicity , we considered two simple distributions of the disorder , a gaussian distribution @xmath38 which is fully characterized by its mean , @xmath39 and variance , @xmath40 , and the uniform distribution ( ) .",
    "different realizations of the quenched disorder are presented in the appendix @xcite . in what follows , we investigated the model in two spatial dimensions , and we used the following model parameters : @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 , @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 , @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "these values were adopted from previous studies @xcite , to allow for an easy comparison with published results for homogeneous ( non - disordered ) systems .",
    "the first expected effect of the disorder is a modification of the patterns formed by the vegetation ( similar to the effect we saw in the swift - hohenberg model , fig .",
    "[ fig : shpatt ] ) .",
    "we find that the same basic five states along a rainfall gradient appear in disordered systems .",
    "the steady state patterns under different precipitation rates are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in systems with no disorder , a state composed of domains of different stable states is unstable @xcite , and one of the states will propagate and eventually cover the whole domain ( note the difference between coexistence and bistability ) .",
    "the disorder allows for the coexistence of different patterns as a steady state ( see the panels for @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and the panel for @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a ) .",
    "this effect is important in explaining the observations of mixed patterns , such as those shown in the appendix @xcite .    the effect on the pattern formed by the vegetation for different strengths of the disorder is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a . under the same precipitation rate ,",
    "the vegetation formed different patterns due to the disorder .",
    "the pattern formation , in the presence of the disorder , is the result of the interplay between two effects , the self - organization and the imposed pattern . for weak disorder ,",
    "the pattern is mostly determined by the self - organization interactions , and for strong disorder , the dominant effect is the disorder - imposed pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b , we show the fourier transform amplitudes of the patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a .",
    "the transition from a pattern with strong peaks , for the self - organized pattern , to a broad spectrum , for the disorder - imposed pattern , is easily seen . to further clarify the effect of the disorder , we show , in fig . [ fig:2]c , the cross - correlation between @xmath32 and the biomass density , @xmath19 . for weak disorder",
    ", there is very little correlation between the two . for stronger disorder",
    ", there is a significant anti - correlation , which reflects the fact that vegetation tends to grow in `` niches '' where the evaporation and drainage rate is small .",
    "the two datasets ( red and blue ) correspond to gaussian and uniform distributions of the disorder , respectively .",
    "the error bars were derived from eight realizations of the quenched disorder for each of the distributions .    , at precipitation values corresponding to the black dots ( @xmath55 @xmath56 in panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ) .",
    "the panels in the right column of the inset show the vegetation patterns at the same precipitation rate values for the homogeneous system .",
    "other model parameters are specified in the text . ]",
    "the most significant effect of the disorder is the increased durability . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we show the total biomass in the simulated system versus the precipitation rate .",
    "the more disordered the system ( the larger @xmath57 is ) , the more deleterious conditions ( lower precipitation rate ) it can survive . in addition , the transition from the vegetation pattern to the bare - soil state becomes more gradual as the disorder increases .",
    "the inset panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] show the vegetation patterns at precipitation values corresponding to the dots .",
    "the left column of the inset shows the patterns for the disordered system , @xmath58 , and the right column shows the patterns for the homogeneous system .",
    "the inset panels demonstrate the fact that the vegetation in the disordered system survives under conditions in which the homogeneous system collapses to the bare - soil state .    in figure [ fig:4 ]",
    ", we present the critical value of the bifurcation parameter , @xmath59 , for which the vegetation collapses into the bare - soil state ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the two datasets ( blue and red ) correspond to gaussian and uniform distributions of the disorder , respectively .",
    "the error bars were derived from eight realizations of the disorder for each value of @xmath57 and each distribution .",
    "the qualitative behavior , namely the increased durability for stronger disorder , is the same for both distributions .",
    "the inset shows @xmath59 versus @xmath32 for homogeneous systems .",
    ", versus the standard deviation of @xmath32 s probability density function .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviation in the value of @xmath59 as derived from eight realizations of the quenched disorder .",
    "the inset shows @xmath59 for the case of no disorder and different values of @xmath32 .",
    "the two datasets correspond to gaussian and uniform distributions of the disorder . ]",
    "another important effect of the disorder is seen when investigating the resilience of the system .",
    "when the precipitation rate is decreased , the total biomass is decreased and vice versa . in the absence of disorder , the dynamics of the system in both directions , increase and decrease of the bifurcation parameter , occurs along the same line in the bifurcation diagram as shown by the red and green lines in figure [ fig : hysteresis ] .",
    "however , the disorder induces a hysteresis in the response of the system as shown by the black and blue lines in figure [ fig : hysteresis ] .",
    "it is important to note that this type of hysteresis occurs well before the critical transition from one basic state to another .",
    "our results show that as expected , the quenched disorder affects the patterns formed . in the swift - hohenberg model",
    ", the modification appears mainly as distortions of the periodic patterns .",
    "interestingly , the interplay between the self - organized and imposed patterns not only modifies the pattern formed but also allows the coexistence of several patterns , such as labyrinthine and spotted patterns , as a stable state of the system .",
    "the latter is easily seen in the results for the model for dryland vegetation dynamics , which was simulated in two spatial dimensions that allowed patterns with different symmetries .",
    "we showed that as the disorder increases , the pattern formed shifts from the self - organized pattern to the imposed pattern .",
    "the disorder allows for different domains to be in different states , thereby not only affecting the patterns but also increasing the durability of the system and making the transition to the bare - soil state more gradual .",
    "the cross - correlations between the disordered parameter and the dynamical variable reveal that there is an essential difference between pattern - forming systems and systems exhibiting a bistability of uniform states . in the latter type of systems , the cross - correlations are very high for all values of the bifurcation parameter , reflecting the fact that the dynamical variable responds locally to better / worse conditions .",
    "however , for pattern - forming systems , the cross - correlations are lower due to the short - range positive feedbacks that allow the dynamical variable to respond to the conditions in the vicinity ( and not just to the local conditions ) .",
    "interestingly , this behavior suggests that the cross - correlations may serve as an indicator for approaching critical transitions . as the system approaches the critical transition , the cross - correlations are stronger due to the fact that the dynamical variable survives only in preferred niches .",
    "similar , but much weaker , results were obtained for disorder in the soil - water diffusivity @xcite .",
    "the reason for the weaker effect of disordered diffusivity is the spatial averaging by the nonlocal term  the spatial derivatives .",
    "the averaging narrows the effective width of the diffusivity distribution , thereby reducing the effects of its disorder .",
    "interestingly , the disorder qualitatively affects the dynamics of the system even far from the critical point . in pattern - forming systems",
    ", the feedbacks representing the short - range facilitation can stop the propagation of fronts between domains in different states , and therefore , the disorder strongly affects the dynamics of the system .",
    "we showed that the disorder induces a hysteresis in the response of the system to adiabatic changes in the bifurcation parameter .",
    "for homogeneous systems , the dynamics is reversible , while in disordered systems , local domains shift from one state to another and only recover at higher values of the bifurcation parameter , thereby inducing the hysteresis .",
    "in addition to the fundamental swift - hohenberg model and the model for dryland vegetation dynamics , we also used other pattern - forming models and found qualitatively the same results as those presented here . therefore , we believe that the results are valid for any pattern - forming system . spatially extended systems ( and , in particular , ecosystems ) are often heterogeneous , and therefore , the effects of quenched disorder can not be ignored when studying critical transitions and , in particular , early warning signals for imminent regime shifts .",
    "a very interesting question is how spatially correlated disorder affects the dynamics and bifurcation diagrams of nonlinear systems .",
    "it is expected that the interplay between the correlation length of the disorder and the typical length of the self - organized pattern will also affect the system .",
    "the significance and relevance of the results presented here extend beyond the context of vegetation dynamics ; the findings emphasize the importance of studying the effects of quenched disorder in a wide array of physical systems , including condensed matter ( in particular , vortex matter in type - ii superconductors , which is strongly affected by quenched disorder @xcite ) , nonlinear optics , chemical reactions , sand dune dynamics and many others .",

    "the altitude is @xmath66 above sea level .",
    "the mean precipitation rate in this area is less than @xmath67 .",
    "the coexistence of labyrinthine / striped and spotted patterns is remarkable . ]",
    "the cross - correlation between the disordered parameter and the dynamical variable is suggested as an early indicator for imminent regime shifts .",
    "we mentioned in the main text that due to nonlocal terms , the cross - correlation is maximal when the average value of the disordered parameter in the vicinity of each point is considered rather than the local value .",
    "the size of the domain is determined by the nonlocal term whose length scale is dictated by the parameter @xmath69 . in order to find the optimal size of the domain , we calculated the following cross - correlation function : @xmath70 here , @xmath2 is the disordered parameter , @xmath16 is the dynamical variable , @xmath71 is the number of sites simulated , @xmath72 is the length of the domain over which the disordered parameter is averaged and the angular brackets denote spatial averaging over the whole simulated domain . in figure",
    "[ fig : ccl ] , we present the cross - correlation versus @xmath72 for different realizations of the disorder . in this figure , we used the swift - hohenberg model with the parameters specified in the main text and @xmath73 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 was drawn from a uniform distribution of width @xmath14 .",
    "one can easily see that while the maximal cross - correlation varies between the different realizations of the disorder , it is obtained for the same size of the spatial averaging domain , @xmath74 ( because the size of each grid cell is @xmath75 , it implies a domain of size @xmath76 ) .",

    "<S> in addition , the disorder induces hysteresis in the response of the system to changes in the bifurcation parameter well before the critical transition occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the cross - correlation between the disordered parameter and the dynamical variable can serve as an early indicator for an imminent critical transition . </S>"
