    "in recent years much attention has been paid to the origin of intermittency in fully developed turbulence .",
    "progress has been made in the somewhat simpler problem of the anomalous scaling in the passive advection of a scalar quantity ( e.g.  temperature or the density of a pollutant ) .",
    "fundamental analytical results have been obtained when the advecting velocity field was assumed to be gaussian and delta - correlated in time , the so - called kraichnan model @xcite , and in the context of shell models @xcite . here",
    "we consider the perhaps more realistic situation where the passive scalar shell model is driven by a non - gaussian velocity field with finite correlation time , namely the velocity field of the goy model @xcite . in this case",
    "the model can be analyzed using standard techniques of ( low ) dimensional dynamical systems , e.g.  the study of bifurcations , eigenvalue spectra and lyapunov exponents .    in absence of convective effects",
    "the passive scalar field @xmath2 is governed by the equation : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the velocity field , @xmath5 is an external forcing and @xmath6 is the diffusion coefficient .    according to the analogue of the k41 theory @xcite for the passive scalar , developed by obukhov and corrsin @xcite , the structure functions @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) scale linearly with p , more precisely @xmath9 .",
    "experimentally , however , one observes for @xmath10 @xcite strong deviations from this .",
    "this is usually referred to as anomalous scaling or intermittency .",
    "the deviations seem to be even more pronounced than for the structure functions of the velocity : the passive scalar is said to be more intermittent",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows : after having introduced the model , we examine in section iii the scaling of its fixed points and in section iv their stability .",
    "these studies have already been performed for the goy model @xcite , to which the passive scalar model is coupled .",
    "we will review these results for the sake of completeness . in section v we study the full dynamics of the model and investigate its chaotic and intermittent behavior .",
    "shell models appear to capture many properties of fully developed turbulent flows but are easier to study than the navier - stokes equations ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this letter",
    "we study the passive scalar shell model proposed in ref .",
    "the multiscaling of the model is in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the goy model has been studied intensively @xcite ; the passive scalar model has attracted somewhat less attention @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "both models are constructed in fourier space , retaining only the complex modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 as a representative of all modes in the shell of wave number @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "one uses the following assumptions : ( i ) the dissipation resp .",
    "diffusion is represented by a linear term of the form : @xmath16 resp .",
    "@xmath17 ( ii ) the nonlinear terms of the form @xmath18 resp.@xmath19 with ( iii ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 among the nearest and next - nearest neighbors of @xmath22 and ( iv ) in absence of forcing and damping conservation of volume in phase space and conservation of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "moreover the scaling laws @xmath25 and @xmath26 form a fixed point of the inviscid unforced equations .",
    "the resulting equations are @xcite : @xmath27    a possible choice for the coefficients is : @xmath28 the boundary conditions are : @xmath29    for the parameters , we choose for example the following standard values : @xmath30 the free parameter @xmath31 is related to a second quadratic invariant which for the canonical value @xmath32 is similar to the helicity @xcite .",
    "these equations determine the evolution of the vector @xmath33 and thus form a @xmath34 dynamical system .",
    "a first step towards a full understanding of the model consists of an investigation of its static properties . in this section",
    "we examine the scaling properties of the fixed points of equations ( [ goy])-([passhell ] ) .",
    "the major problem is to find the static solutions of ( [ goy ] ) , those of ( [ passhell ] ) can then be found easily because @xmath35 is linear in both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that ( [ goy ] ) in the unforced inviscid limit allows three self - similar static solutions : the trivial fixed point @xmath38 , a `` kolmogorov '' fixed point @xmath39 and a `` flux - less '' fixed point @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 any function of period three in @xmath22 and @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding fixed points of ( [ passhell ] ) are : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we will here focus on the kolmogorov fixed point which is believed to be the most important for the dynamics @xcite although it was suggested that also the trivial fixed point might play a major role @xcite .",
    "we note that the static solution for @xmath47 can be turned into real form by a change of phase .",
    "following schrghofer et al.@xcite we choose the phases : @xmath48 it can be shown that the static solution of @xmath37 picks up the same phase as that of @xmath36 .",
    "as has been observed @xcite , the dynamics of the system converges to the kolmogorov fixed point for @xmath49 . when increasing @xmath31 the system undergoes a series of hopf bifurcations and becomes chaotic at @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "in order to find the kolmogorov fixed point one can thus vary @xmath31 in small steps and refine the solution with newton s method @xcite .    to study the scaling behavior of the static solutions , we apply a much larger number of shells , using the same parameter values as kadanoff et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 the forcing acts in this case on the first shell .    for the static solution of @xmath11 we obtain the same result as @xcite , see figure [ ukad ] , where @xmath52 is plotted versus @xmath22 .",

    "there is clearly not a well - defined power law scaling .",
    "this solution also displays the period three behavior . in the diffusive range",
    "the solution looks somewhat noisy , presumably due to the boundary conditions .",
    "it is clear , that there is a `` slow '' bending in the diffusive regime but as @xmath6 approaches zero , the curve becomes more and more flat and we recover the obukhov scaling in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "we thus note that in contrast to the velocity - case where the viscosity only affects the viscous range , for the passive scalar the diffusion seems to act on the whole inertial range , at least for prandtl numbers @xmath55 .",
    "this might have its origin in the linear character of the problem .",

    "now the stability of the kolmogorov - obukhov fixed point is examined in terms of the eigenvalue spectra .",
    "the system eq.([goy]-[passhell ] ) is written as @xmath57    the jacobian matrix is symbolically given by : @xmath58 the matrix @xmath59 will not matter for the eigenvalues of @xmath60 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath61 were studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is most convenient to look at disturbances of phase and modulus of the velocity variable @xmath62 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "one then obtains for the stability of the modulus : @xmath65 the matrices @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the contributions of the dissipation and cascade terms , respectively .",
    "their expressions are : @xmath68 and @xmath69 where the index @xmath70 has been dropped , for convenience .",
    "the linearized equation for the variation of the phase is : @xmath71    thus the stability eigenvalues of modulus and phases differ only in a minus - sign in front of the cascade term .",
    "we obtain similar results as in @xcite . for values of @xmath72",
    "all the eigenvalues of both phase and modulus matrix have negative real part . above this value ,",
    "some of the real eigenvalues of the phase matrix turn complex ( in pairs ) and cross the imaginary axis . at @xmath73",
    "they have become real again , but now positive .",
    "this situation is shown in figure [ ueig ] .",
    "the eigenvalues of the modulus matrix eventually turn positive at @xmath74 . in figure [ ueig ]",
    "we have multiplied both real and imaginary part with a factor @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76 thus the phase remains unchanged , while the modulus is rescaled . in case",
    "the eigenvalues have constant ratios , they are evenly spaced on the plot .",
    "thus we are able to visualize both the very small and very large eigenvalues .",

    "gets @xmath84    we note that since @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the matrix @xmath81 is antisymmetric and its eigenvalues will be purely imaginary",
    ". the stability of phase and modulus will thus be the same .",
    "this is actually a consequence of the conservation of @xmath87 . in the model",
    "any cascade term @xmath88 has to be supplemented by a term @xmath89 , since the conservation implies @xmath90 .",
    "the first term gives a contribution to the matrix @xmath81 : @xmath91 , the second @xmath92 which corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "the matrix is thus antisymmetric and this is not an artefact of the model since it stems from a conservation law also valid in a real system .",
    "one does not expect to find any bifurcations since the diffusion matrix @xmath94 will cause the eigenvalues to have negative real parts , whatever the value of the driving velocity .",
    "indeed one finds that for all values of @xmath31 , the spectrum of eigenvalues of the phase matrix is like shown in figure [ theig ] , where the eigenvalues are again multiplied by @xmath75 .",
    "one observes evenly spaced eigenvalues organized in branches .",
    "the presence of three branches ( in both upper and lower half of the complex plane ) might be caused by the period three of @xmath11 ( in @xmath22 ) .",
    "if one inserts in the matrix @xmath81 a fixed point of an imaginary model without period 3 , one just finds one branch in each half plane .",
    "= 0.0022    ( 200,200)(0,0 ) ( 0,0)(200,200)=180    let s us now consider what the above imply for the dynamics of the model . at time",
    "@xmath95 , starting from the particular state of the scalar @xmath96 we impose a small perturbation : @xmath97 and look how the perturbation evolves in time , subjected to the _ same _ velocity field . for modulus and phase of @xmath98 we have again equations ( [ thmod ] ) and ( [ thphas ] ) , since the matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 do not depend on @xmath37 .",
    "because the eigenvalues of @xmath101 have negative real parts , the perturbation will damp out , meaning that after some time @xmath102 .",
    "this has been observed already by crisanti et al .",
    "the term intermittency is used in different contexts and a precise mathematical definition does not exist . in turbulence one speaks of intermittency corrections to the kolmogorov or obukhov - corrsin power law . in dynamical systems in general",
    ", intermittency means the presence of quiescent periods randomly interrupted by burst .",
    "it is believed that these phenomena are related : the scaling corrections should have their origin in intermittent behavior ( in space and/or time ) of velocity or energy dissipation .",
    "here we ask ourselves the question whether the more pronounced deviations from classical scaling for the passive scalar are reflected by a more intermittent behavior ( in time ) of the passive scalar field . in order to test this",
    "we invoke a definition of intermittency for dynamical systems proposed by benzi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "firstly , the response function @xmath103 is defined as the rate at which a disturbance vector @xmath104 of the system @xmath105 has expanded after a time @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 in chaotic systems one typically observes that @xmath108 @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "this maximum lyaponov exponent can be calculated by averaging the _ instantaneous _ lyapunov exponents @xmath111 : @xmath112 .",
    "intermittency can be thought of as connected to the fluctuations of the instantaneous lyapunov exponent .",
    "an intermittency parameter @xmath113 is thus defined as the _ variance _ of @xmath114 @xcite : @xmath115 numerically we proceed as follows : the equations of motion ( [ goy]-[passhell ] ) are numerically integrated along the equations for the disturbance vector @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath60 is the jacobian matrix .",
    "we then estimate the response function and the first two cumulants of its logarithm . from time to time",
    "the disturbance vector is renormalized in order to avoid numerical overflow @xcite .",
    "consider now the lyapunov exponents of the full system of velocity and passive scalar field ( [ goy]-[passhell ] ) , with the parameters ( [ standpar ] ) .",
    "we distinguish how the perturbation , initially applied equally on _ both _",
    "systems ( @xmath118 for all @xmath22 ) , evolves independently in each of the two parts of the system .",
    "therefore we introduce response functions that measure the expansions on the velocity part @xmath119 and on the scalar part @xmath120 .",
    "they are defined as : @xmath121 the corresponding maximal lyapunov exponents is defined as : @xmath122 and the analogue for @xmath123 .",
    "this is reminiscent to the `` eulerian lyapunov exponent '' and `` lagrangian lyapunov exponent '' introduced by crisanti et al.@xcite .",
    "however the lagrangian behavior of the particles is only equivalent to the eulerian passive scalar field in the case of vanishing diffusion .",
    "the intermittency parameters are related to the variance of @xmath124 is the same way as before .",
    "we find numerically : @xmath125 where we have denoted the lyapunov exponent for the full system as : @xmath126 . on expects theoretically : @xmath127\\ ] ] since the disturbance vector will evolve towards the most expanding direction .",
    "our result is obviously in agreement with this relation .",
    "for the eulerian and lagrangian lyapunov exponent , one has numerically found the generic inequality @xmath128 . our result @xmath129 might be due to the presence of a finite value of diffusivity .",
    "the intermittency parameters @xmath113 differ on the other hand significantly from each other .",
    "we find ( for @xmath73 ) : @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "thus the passive scalar behaves equally chaotic , but more intermittent , than the velocity . in order to understand this we write the equation for @xmath37 as follows : @xmath133 where a is a matrix depending on @xmath36 , whose eigenvalues @xmath134 fulfil the inequality @xmath135 .",
    "thus , if @xmath36 is constant in time , @xmath37 will converge to its fixed point @xmath136 .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath36 fluctuates as for @xmath73 in the goy model , this `` fixed point '' will fluctuate as well",
    ". moreover the convergence towards it will be irregular since the eigenvalues of @xmath137 vary .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the behavior of @xmath37 is more intermittent than that of @xmath36 .",
    "we studied various properties of a shell model for the advection of a passive scalar .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of the kolmogorov fixed point and show that the passive scalar part is stable against perturbations .",
    "this is in fact not very surprising since it follows from conservation of @xmath138 .",
    "the fixed point does on the other hand not follow the obukhov - corrsin scaling .",
    "this suggests that the scaling properties of the passive scalar are much more sensitive , than the velocity , to non - inertial properties such as the dissipation and perhaps also the forcing . in experiments the scaling zones of the passive scalar",
    "are less clearly observed and some `` nonuniversality '' ( with respect to forcing ) seems to have been observed in @xcite , but we of course can not pretend that the mechanism observed here will be found also in real systems .    we have measured the relation between lyapunov exponents and intermittency parameters of the passive scalar and velocity .",
    "we find : @xmath129 and @xmath139 .",
    "thus the passive scalar behaves more intermittently which is in agreement with its more pronounced deviations from linear scaling .",
    "it would be interesting to establish these relations from the equations of motion .",
    "it could also be interesting to investigate the relation between coherent structures in the goy model @xcite and those in the passive scalar model .",

    "discussions with hugues chat , ted janssen , anal lematre and paolo muratore - ginanneschi are kindly acknowledged .",
