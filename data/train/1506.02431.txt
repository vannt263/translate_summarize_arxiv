    "the recent technological revolution with widespread presence of computers and internet has created an unprecedented situation of data deluge , changing dramatically the way in which we look at social and economic sciences .",
    "the constantly increasing use of the internet as a source of information , such as business or political news , triggered an analogous increasing online activity .",
    "the interaction with technological systems is generating massive datasets that document collective behavior in a previously unimaginable fashion @xcite . ultimately , in this vast repository of internet activity we can find the interests , concerns , and intentions of the global population with respect to various economic , political , and cultural phenomena .    among the many fields of applications of data collection , analysis and modeling , we present here a case study on financial systems .",
    "we believe that social aspects as measured by social networks are particularly useful to understand financial turnovers .",
    "indeed , financial contagion and , ultimately , crises , are often originated by collective phenomena such as herding among investors ( or , in extreme cases , panic ) which signal the intrinsic complexity of the financial system @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility to anticipate anomalous collective behavior of investors is of great interest to policy makers @xcite because it may allow for a more prompt intervention , when appropriate .",
    "[ [ state - of - the - art . ] ] state - of - the - art .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we briefly review the state - of - the - art research which investigates the correlation between the web data and financial markets .",
    "three major classes of data are considered : web news , search engine queries , and social media . regarding news ,",
    "various approaches have been attempted .",
    "they study : ( i ) the connection of exogenous news with price movements@xcite , ( ii ) the stock price reaction to news@xcite ; ( iii ) the relations between mentions of a company in financial news @xcite , or the pessimism of the media@xcite , and trading volume ; ( iv ) the relation between the sentiment of news , earnings and return predictability@xcite , ( v ) the role of news in trading actions @xcite , especially of short sellers @xcite ; ( vi ) the role of macroeconomic news in stock returns @xcite ; and finally ( vii ) the high - frequency market reactions to news @xcite .",
    "there are several analyses of search engine queries .",
    "a relation between the daily number of queries for a particular stock , and daily trading volume of the same stock has been studied by @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was done for a sample of russell 3000 stocks , where an increase in queries predicts higher stock prices in the next two weeks @xcite .",
    "search engine query data from google trends has been used to evaluate stock riskiness @xcite .",
    "some other authors used google trends to predict market movements @xcite .",
    "also , search engine query data has been used as a proxy for analyzing investor attention related to initial public offerings ( ipos ) @xcite .",
    "regarding social media , twitter is becoming an increasingly popular micro - blogging platform used for financial forecasting @xcite .",
    "one line of research investigates the relation between the volume of tweets and financial markets .",
    "for example , @xcite studied whether the daily number of tweets predicts the s&p 500 stock indicators .",
    "another line of research explores the contents of tweets . in a textual analysis approach to twitter data ,",
    "the authors find clear relations between the mood indicators and dow jones industrial average ( djia ) @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that the twitter sentiment for five retail companies has statistically significant relation with stock returns and volatility .",
    "a recent study @xcite compares the information content of the twitter sentiment and volume in terms of their influence on future stock prices .",
    "the authors relate the intra - day twitter and price data , at hourly resolution , and show that the twitter sentiment contains significantly more lead - time information about the prices than the twitter volume alone .",
    "they apply stringent statistics which require relatively high volume of tweets over the entire period of three months , and , as a consequence , only 12 financial instruments pass the test .    [",
    "[ motivation . ] ] motivation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    despite the high quality of the data sets used , the level of empirical correlation between stock price derived financial time series and web derived time series remains limited , especially when a textual analysis of web messages is applied .",
    "this observation suggests that the relation between these two systems is more complex and that a simple measure of correlation is not enough to capture the dynamics of the interaction between the two systems .",
    "it is possible that the two systems are dependent only at some moments of their evolution , and not over the entire time period .    in this paper",
    ", we study the relation between stock price returns and the sentiment expressed in financial tweets posted on twitter .",
    "we analyze a carefully collected and annotated set of tweets about the previously - mentioned 30 djia companies . for each of these companies",
    "we build a time series of the sentiment expressed in the tweets , with daily resolution , designed to mimic the wisdom - of - crowd effect , as observed in previous works . as first analysis",
    "we compute the pearson correlation between price return time series and the sentiment time series generated from the tweets .",
    "we also run a granger causality test @xcite to study the forecasting power of the twitter time series .",
    "when considering the entire period of 15 months , the values of pearson correlation are low and only a few companies pass the granger causality test .    in order to detect the presence of a stronger correlation , at least in some portions of the time series",
    ", we consider the relation between the stock price returns and twitter sentiment through the technique of `` event study '' @xcite , known in economics and finance .",
    "this technique has been generally used to verify if the sentiment content of earnings announcements conveys useful information for the valuation of companies . here",
    "we apply a similar approach , but instead of using the sentiment of earnings announcement , we use the aggregate sentiment expressed in financial tweets .    [ [ contributions . ] ] contributions .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    by restricting our analysis to shorter time periods around the `` events '' we find a statistically significant relation between the twitter sentiment and stock returns .",
    "these results are consistent with the existing literature on the information content of earnings @xcite .",
    "a recent related study @xcite , also applies the `` event study '' methodology to twitter data .",
    "the authors come to similar conclusions as we do : financial twitter data , when considering both , the volume and sentiment of tweets , does have a statistically significant impact on stock returns .",
    "it is interesting that two independent studies , to the best of our knowledge the first adaptations of `` event study '' to twitter data , corroborate the conclusions .",
    "this paper presents a complementary study to @xcite , and uses a slightly different experimental setup .",
    "the studies use disjoint sets of stocks ( s&p 500 vs. djia 30 ) , non - overlapping time windows ( january  june 2010 vs. june 2013september 2014 ) , different sentiment classification techniques ( naive bayes vs. support vector machine ) , different event detection algorithms , and different statistics for significance testing .",
    "we point out the differences between the two studies in the appropriate sections of the paper . despite the methodological differences",
    ", we can confirm the main results reported in @xcite to a large extent . from this perspective ,",
    "one of the contributions of this work is in providing even more evidence , over a longer time period , for the conclusions drawn in both studies .",
    "the second contribution is that the twitter sentiment time series are made publicly available .",
    "they can be used not only to validate our results but also to carry out additional studies that do not necessarily follow the same methodology .",
    "the dataset allows one to study different sentiment aggregations , different events ( points in time ) , and different post - event effects ( such as drifts , reversals , and changes in volatility rather than abnormal returns ) .",
    "the third contribution , as compared to @xcite , is the use of a high quality sentiment classifier , and the realistic evaluation of its performance .",
    "our sentiment classifier was trained on a much larger training set ( 2,500 vs. over 100,000 annotated tweets in our case ) , and exhaustively evaluated .",
    "this resulted in the performance that matches the agreement between financial experts .",
    "the human annotation of such large number of tweets is relatively expensive .",
    "however , there are several advantages . first",
    ", a considerable amount of tweets can be annotated twice , by two different annotators , in order to compute the inter - annotator agreement and thus establish an upper bound on the performance .",
    "second , there is no need to collect domain - specific vocabularies , since the annotation process itself is domain and language specific .",
    "third , once a large enough set of tweets is assigned a sentiment label , the classifier construction is automated and the domain - specific sentiment models are available for real - time processing .",
    "we have already applied the same sentiment classification methodology in various domains , such as : ( i ) to study the emotional dynamics of facebook comments on conspiracy theories ( in italian ) @xcite , ( ii ) to compare the sentiment leaning of different network communities towards various environmental topics @xcite , and ( iii ) to monitor the sentiment about political parties before and after the elections ( in bulgarian ) @xcite .",
    "our analysis is conducted on 30 stocks of the djia index .",
    "the stock data are collected for a period of 15 months between 2013 and 2014 .",
    "the ticker list of the investigated stocks is shown in table [ tbl_stocks ] . in the analysis",
    "we investigate the relation between price / market data , and twitter data .",
    "the details of both are given in the remainder of this section .",
    ".the collected twitter data for the 15 months period : the company names and the number of tweets . [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results are similar to the ones reported by sprenger at al . @xcite .",
    "in addition , the authors show statistically significant increase in the @xmath0 values even before the positive event days .",
    "they argue that this is due to the information leakage before the earnings announcements .",
    "we observe a similar phenomena , but with very low @xmath0 values , and not statistically significant ( cf . the positive events at day @xmath1 in figure [ eapeaks4 ] ) .",
    "in this work we present significant evidence of dependence between stock price returns and twitter sentiment in tweets about the companies . as a series of other papers",
    "have already shown , there is a signal worth investigating which connects social media and market behavior .",
    "this opens the way , if not to forecasting , then at least to `` now - casting '' financial markets .",
    "the caveat is that this dependence becomes useful only when data are properly selected , or different sources of data are analyzed together .",
    "for this reason , in this paper , we first identify events , marked by increased activity of twitter users , and then observe market behavior in the days following the events .",
    "this choice is due to our hypothesis that only at some moments , identified as events , there is a strong interaction between the financial market and twitter sentiment .",
    "our main result is that the aggregate twitter sentiment during the events implies the direction of market evolution .",
    "while this can be expected for peaks related to `` known '' events , like earnings announcements , it is really interesting to note that a similar conclusion holds also when peaks do not correspond to any expected news about the stock traded .",
    "similar results were corroborated in a recent , independent study by sprenger et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors have made an additional step , and classified the non - ea events into a comprehensive set of 16 company - specific categories .",
    "they have used the same training set of 2,500 manually classified tweets to train a naive bayesian classifier which can then reasonably well discriminate between the 16 categories . in our future work",
    ", we plan to identify topics , which are not predefined , from all the tweets of non - ea events .",
    "we intend to apply standard topic detection algorithms , such as latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) or clustering techniques .",
    "studies as this one could be well used in order to establish a direct relation between social networks and market behavior .",
    "a specific application could , for example , detect and possibly mitigate panic diffusion in the market from social network analysis . to such purpose there is some additional research to be done in the future .",
    "one possible direction is to test the presence of forecasting power of the sentiment time series .",
    "following an approach similar to the one presented by moat et al .",
    "@xcite one can decide to buy or sell according to the presence of a peak in the tweet volume and the level of polarity in the corresponding direction .",
    "however , detection of twitter events should rely just on the current and past twitter volume .",
    "also , during the events , we might move to a finer time scale , e.g. , from daily to hourly resolution , as done by @xcite .",
    "finally , our short term plan is to extend the analysis to a larger number of companies with high twitter volume , and over longer period of time .",
    "the authors would like to thank sowa labs for providing the raw twitter data and the annotated tweets of the djia 30 stocks for this research , and to sao rutar for running the annotator agreement and sentiment classification evaluations .",
