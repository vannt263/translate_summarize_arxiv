    "many experimental groups are presently working on the formation of ultracold molecules and molecular quantum gases .",
    "a very efficient scheme is the photoassociation reaction , where two colliding atoms absorb a photon to make a molecule @xcite ; moreover ultracold photoassociation spectroscopy @xcite is capable of providing deep insight into the properties of long range molecules , cold atomic collisions , or pair correlations in a condensate .",
    "theoretical two - body scattering models have been developed to compute the photoassociation rates @xcite , in the framework of a perturbative treatment , adapted to situations where low - intensity cw lasers are employed and many - body effects are negligible . a linear variation of the photoassociation rate as a function of intensity is then predicted . in the work of bohn and julienne @xcite , which develops a semi - analytic theory yielding laser - induced energy shifts and l ine broadening ,",
    "the departure from this linear behavior is described , the saturation limit at larger laser intensities being evaluated . in a condensate , the two - body model should fail and javanainen and mackie @xcite have developed a many - body theory which predicts a saturation limit occurring at lower intensities and attributed to rogue photodissociation .",
    "the search for saturation effects has stimulated several experiments .",
    "measurement , by mc kenzie _ et al _ @xcite , of the photoassociation rate in a sodium condensate as a function of laser intensity has shown a linear behavior in the intensity range considered , in agreement with the two - body bohn and julienne estimation , and in contrast with the prediction of javanainen and mackie . for a quantum degenerate lithium atomic gas , measurement @xcite of the intensity dependence of the photoassociation rate",
    "has verified both the large value of this rate ( at a temperature @xmath0=600 nk ) and the two - body saturation effect at intensities @xmath1 30 w/@xmath2 .",
    "the agreement with theory is considered as reasonable within the present experimental accuracy : the higher value of the measured saturation limit , and the oscillations in the experimental rate in the 30 - 80 w/@xmath2 intensity range should be confirmed by measurements with a smaller error bar . for a non - degenerate gas of cesium atoms , at a temperature of 40 @xmath3k , within an optical dipole trap , saturation limit is reached for intensities above 100 w/@xmath2@xcite , and the experimental values then lay around the theoretical curve : it is not clear whether such oscillations are due to uncertainties or should be attributed to a physical effect .",
    "+ recently naidon and masnou - seeuws @xcite have developed a time - dependent many - body theory of photoassociation in an atomic bose - einstein condensate , showing that several physical effects depend on pair correlations .",
    "they show that the two existing models for the description of such correlations @xcite , differ in their predictions of the photoassociation line shapes at large intensities .",
    "precise measurements of the variation of the line shapes as a function of cw laser intensity should therefore give insight into the optimal description of many - body effects .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to anticipate such measurements by revisiting the theoretical treatment of photoassociation line shapes , taking advantage of the efficiency of grid methods @xcite for the numerical description of cold collisions and long range molecules , particularly in cases where several channels are involved .",
    "actually , the later methods have been widely used for the computation of photoassociation rates @xcite , since they can determine very precise energies and wave functions , both for bound and for continuum levels .",
    "it has been demonstrated that due to their global character , mapped grid methods are ideally suited to precise computation of the perturbations occurring in molecular spectra , such as rb@xmath4@xcite or k@xmath4@xcite singlet - triplet mixing . in such cases , the perturbation of one level of a given series should be attributed to a large number of bound or continuum levels of the other series , and local perturbation treatments are poorly adapted .",
    "however , up to know , attempts to compute the photoassociation line shapes via grid methods have not been very efficient @xcite and the interpretation of precise measurements is routinely performed with numerov type approaches @xcite .",
    "the present paper is proposing an alternative way of implementing grid methods for the calculation of photoassociation line shapes , energy shifts , and rates .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : the description of the present model is reported in section ii - iv .",
    "the link with previous models , such as the bohn and julienne model is discussed in section v , where the various assumptions and approximations are underlined .",
    "application to the cases of sodium photoassociation in the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite is presented in section vi .",
    "section vii will summaries and discuss the outlook of the method .",
    "the physical process of photoassociation ( pa ) can be divided into three steps . _ initially _ ( step i ) , a thermal ensemble of cold atoms is in the ground electronic state ; the probability to find a colliding pair with relative motion at energy @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath0 is the temperature , and @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the partition function @xmath9 was shown in @xcite to be well approximated by the classical expression @xmath10 for a gas of non - interacting pairs in a volume @xmath11 .",
    "further discussion regarding @xmath9 could be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the radial wave function which corresponds to the pair is represented with a continuum eigenfunction @xmath12 of the single - channel hamiltonian @xmath13 @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the pair , and @xmath16 is the born - oppenheimer potential curve for the relevant , here the ground , electronic state .",
    "+ at the second step ( step ii ) , the intensity of a cw laser with frequency @xmath17 is ramped within a time scale that can be varied from hundreds of ns to several @xmath3s . along this _ preparation _ period ,",
    "the continuum states are coupled to one or more bound vibrational levels @xmath18 that belong to one or more excited electronic states @xmath19 .",
    "each of the levels in the excited state , denoted by @xmath20 , may decay spontaneously with a natural free width @xmath21 , which is typically at the order of ns .",
    "the field that is applied on this stage varies with time , and so are the states of the total system .",
    "+ finally , during the stable period of the experiment ( step iii ) , the laser reaches its peak constant intensity @xmath22 . for the trap - loss or multiphoton detection scheme which will be described here ,",
    "the duration of this period is on the order of ms .",
    "each of the energy levels of the system at this step can now be written as : @xmath23 where we include the possibility of populating bound levels @xmath24 of the ground state . in the present work",
    ", we shall consider only this third step , which of course is influenced by the preparation step .",
    "since we shall not treat explicitly the preparation step , and possible transitory effects , a rapid switching on of the photoassociation laser will be assumed , justifying sudden approximation .",
    "the density of probability for a transition from initial state @xmath25 to a final state @xmath26 is given by : @xmath27 + at section iv it will be shown that a knowledge of @xmath28 is sufficient to extract the experimental parameters of the pa process .",
    "an efficient method to compute the initial and the final states , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is the subject of the next section .",
    "the initial state is a thermal ensemble composed of atom pairs , with several angular momenta @xmath6 .",
    "each pair is coupled to several @xmath31 partial waves components on the excited state . for simplicity",
    ", the equations will be written hereby for one value @xmath6 and@xmath31 of the angular momentum . to obtain @xmath32",
    "one has to compute the initial and final eigenstates of the hamiltonian without and with the light interaction . in the global grid method",
    "used here , this is achieved by representation of the hamiltonian in a certain basis , and then a diagonalization .",
    "the diagonalization step is the most expensive computationally , and it scales as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of basis function .",
    "a selection of an appropriate basis prior to the diagonalization is hence crucial for the efficiency of the method .",
    "+      using numerical grid methods , a numerically complete set of of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the time - independent schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath36 is obtained for the isolated molecule , for the ground and excited potentials .",
    "this is achieved by using the mapped fourier grid method ( see for example the references @xcite ) . within the procedure",
    ", a unitary transformation @xmath37 is performed on the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) , which is written in equally space grid @xmath35 .",
    "the resulted hamiltonian @xmath38 , is represented on a grid with non - uniform distribution of points in the position space @xmath39 , to take advantage of the phase - space occupancy of the problem .",
    "the potential energy operator is written simply as @xmath40 , and the kinetic energy operator reads : @xmath41 @xmath42 is the length of the grid , @xmath43 is the first derivative operator matrix , given by ( assuming even number of grid points ) : @xmath44}},i \\ne j }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath45 is the ( diagonal ) jacobian operator for the transformation .    a sufficient representation for @xmath36 by an equally spaced grid demands typically @xmath46 basis functions for the example considered below in section [ sec : sodium ] .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the use of a mapped grid leads to a reduction of about an order of magnitude in the basis size , to several thousands . +",
    "a diagonalization of @xmath47 gives the initial , interaction - free , wave functions and their energies for both electronic states @xmath48 and @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenvalues with @xmath49 , correspond to bound , discrete states and the ones with @xmath50 refer to box - normalized quasi - continuum states .",
    "the continuum under this picture is therefore tied to the box size from which is was deduced .",
    "+ in order to take account of the spontaneous emission in the excited channel @xmath19 , an imaginary potential is introduced : @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the transition dipole moment , and @xmath53 .",
    "a diagonalization of @xmath54 results a complex eigen - energies .",
    "the imaginary part of the eigenvalues , @xmath55 is interpreted as the lifetime of the level @xmath56 .",
    "a cw laser with constant intensity @xmath22 , detuned by @xmath57 relative to the atomic resonance line , introduces a radiative coupling between the ground state and the excited state . after making the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the full dressed hamiltonian under the interaction can be written as : @xmath58\\ ] ] the coupling between the ground and the excited state is introduced by the rabi coupling operator through the transition dipole moment : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the spatially dependent transition dipole moment between the two electronic states , and @xmath61 is an angular factor depending upon the polarization of the laser and the orientation of the molecular axis . in the @xmath35 representation",
    "@xmath62 is a local , i.e. diagonal , operator .",
    "a diagonalization of @xmath63 gives the final states @xmath64 .",
    "+      for the final states , one has to diagonalize the hamiltonian describing the interaction of the molecule with the radiation field routinely for many experimental parameters .",
    "a direct diagonalization of @xmath65 even for the mapped grid representation , is inefficient , mainly due to mainly due to the redundancy in the representation of the basis for both potentials .",
    "an improved representation for the coupled system is hence crucial",
    ". this can be obtained by writing @xmath66 in the energy eigenstates of the single channels hamiltonians @xmath67 .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath68 is performed on @xmath65 to give @xmath69 the hamiltonian in the energy representation .",
    "the eigenvectors that were obtained as the solutions for the single channel problem serve as the transformation matrices between the two representations , so that : @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 are the matrices which contain the complete set of eigenvectors for the ground and excited states , @xmath48 and @xmath20 , respectively . + the coupled channel hamiltonian in the energy states picture",
    "becomes : +    * for the diagonal part in the excited channel subspace @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the detuning from the atomic resonance , and @xmath74 the natural width for the vibrational level @xmath75 . * for the diagonal matrix elements in the ground channel subspace : @xmath76 for clarity , explicit @xmath6 dependency is ommited .",
    "we remark here again that @xmath77 include both the bound and the quasi - continuum parts of the spectrum .",
    "@xmath78 is therefore discrete , for a given box normalization .",
    "+ *   for the non - diagonal part of @xmath79 : @xmath80 we can employ the r - centroid approximation for @xmath81 and write : @xmath82 where now @xmath83 denotes the frank - condon factor between vibrational levels from the two different electronic states .",
    "the advantage of the energy representation is the possibility to pick the energy levels that participate in the process and thus reduce the required basis set .",
    "we shall consider formally the case of an isolated resonance where the ground state continuum @xmath84 is coupled only to single bound level in the excited state @xmath85 .",
    "the detuning from the atomic resonance @xmath57 could be replaced by @xmath86 , the detuning from the excited bound level .",
    "a generalization to several bound excited states , or even a whole continuum , is straightforward . from this point on , we reduce all the indices for the excited state .",
    "+ by moving to the energy representation we reduce the representation for the coupled channels problem by about one half , to the order of @xmath87 in the example discussed below in section [ sec : sodium ] .",
    "note that so far , the representation of the continuum is done using a box unity - normalized wave functions .",
    "this box - dependent basis for the continuum is arbitrary , and therefore it could be reduced .",
    "+ in order to do so , one had to defined a box - independent frank - condon factor .",
    "box - independent quantities for the continuum are obtained by moving from the box - normalized to the energy - normalized wave functions . the relation between the two",
    "is given by : @xmath89 where the inverse of the level density , @xmath90 , is given simply , for a large enough box , by the energy difference between two adjacent quasi - continuum levels , given under the box - normalization constraint .",
    "an energy normalized frank - condon profile : @xmath91 could now be obtained .",
    "@xmath92 is a box - independent , numerically continuous function of the scattering energy .",
    "in fact , @xmath92 is a physical measure for the energy dependence of the interaction and it thus the function that one would like to sample for obtaining the minimal energy representation .",
    "the alternative basis has to capture the functional energy dependence of the frank - condon profile , using the smallest basis .",
    "this could be done in principle with any sampling procedure @xcite .",
    "the technical details regarding the numerical procedure we employed in this work is described at the appendix .",
    "+ assuming such a minimal representation basis was found , we will denote it by @xmath93 for the ground state continuum , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the number of bound states .",
    "the expression for the quasi - continuum diagonal part of the full hamiltonian ( eq.[eq : hdiag_g ] ) reads now : @xmath96 and all the other diagonal parts remained unchanged .",
    "the nondiagonal part in the alternative basis is defined through the energy normalized frank - condon profile as : @xmath97 + a diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( eqs.[[eq : althdiag_g],[eq : alt_nond ] ] ) gives the set of eigenstates for the coupled hamiltonian , @xmath64 , which include components on both channels , with possible contributions from all the bound or free levels .",
    "the energy eigenvalues which are obtained are again complex and @xmath98 is the width of the level @xmath64 .",
    "the transition probability from any initially populated state @xmath93 to any final state @xmath64 , is simply : @xmath99 + it is important to notice here that because @xmath100 is an eigenstate of the coupled hamiltonian , a pair that reaches this state at the beginning of the final step of the experiment remains in the same state without any significant dynamics beside an exponential decay with the lifetime @xmath101 .",
    "+ table 1 summarizes our procedure so far with the different representations and their typical necessary basis sizes .",
    "we started from the hamiltonian on the equally spaced grid representation .",
    "a minimal representation of the problem with such a grid demands a basis of about @xmath102 function .",
    "we then used the phase space occupation of the problem to move to a mapped grid , and reduce the basis set in about an order on magnitude to @xmath103 , for each of the electronic states .",
    "the transformation to the energy representation reduces the excited state manifold .",
    "the reduced @xmath88 representation minimizes the basis for the ground state , so that finally we could solve the whole coupled channels problem with a basis at the order of @xmath104 , or even smaller . at this sizes of basis",
    "the method become efficient , even compared to the semianalytic perturbative methods .",
    "+    .summary of the different representations used in this paper . @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the typical basis set sizes for the ground and the excited electronic state , respectively , adapted to the example of section [ sec : sodium ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the thermal energy is commonly the smallest energy scale .",
    "it ranges from about a hundred of nanokelvins for the coldest condensates , to a few hundreds microkelvins , for ` hot ' mots . for low temperatures ,",
    "the narrow width of the populated energy band makes the coupling profile to be almost insignificant .",
    "saturation could then be described quite well with the perturbative methods . as the temperature increases , the inner structure of the continuum is encrypted into deviations of the lineshape from a symmetric lorentzian , and an inverted region of @xmath107 as the intensity increases .",
    "some of these deviations , especially the ones which are visible at the low intensity limit , for relatively high temperatures , could be well described by the single - path perturbative models . other features which result only at high intensities ,",
    "could be calculated only with the help of the multi - path model .",
    "+ the non perturbative model that we presented in this paper can serve as a useful tool to model easily other cases where non trivial lineshapes appear .",
    "these include :    * photoassociation close to threshold . *",
    "accidentally degenerate or almost degenerate levels that originate from different electronic states . in both cases ,",
    "interaction between several levels in the excited state need to be put in the framework of a higher order model .",
    "the case of resonant coupling photoassociation @xcite is a good example . * active interaction between multiple continuum manifolds , where more than a single continuum is populated or depopulated during the process .",
    "one possibility is when more then one partial wave participates in the scattering , e.g. , the @xmath108 resonance in @xmath109rb ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in cases of lower barriers , higher temperatures , or in the cases of processes that take place by explicitly populating the continuum ,",
    "highly structured lineshapes might be resolved by our method .",

    "two purposes are the objects of this appendix : the numerical details of the sampling of the continuum profile @xmath116 ( see eq . ( [ eq : fc_profile ] ) ) , and the demonstration of the energy scale that is needed for the calculation of the energy shift .",
    "the sampling of the continuum profile @xmath116 could be done in principle by a global or local numerical sampling procedure ( see for example @xcite).the common procedures take advantage of an a - priori knowledge about the given function to be sampled . in this work we limited ourselves to a naive approach and determined the sampling of the profile a - posteriori according to the results that were obtained with a given basis .",
    "the criterion we employed was the numerical convergence of the integral over a given moment of the interaction profile @xmath116 : @xmath117^n de } } \\approx \\sum_j \\delta(e_j)[{\\cal f}^e ( e_j)]^n\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the order of the moment , @xmath119 is the discrete sampling energy points , and @xmath120 is the energy difference between two adjacent points .",
    "the upper bound for the profile @xmath121 is discussed below .",
    "the procedure initiates with a small set of points , and a new point is added or rejected between any two old points according to its influence on the value of @xmath122 .",
    "the quality of the procedure is determined by the tolerance parameter @xmath123 .",
    "the number of basis functions for the sampling the @xmath124 continuum , as a function of the tolerance parameter is presented in figure a1 .",
    "the various lines present different moments . +    as can be understood , the convergence of the sampling becomes more efficient for higher moments , which emphasize more the features in the profile .",
    "too high moments , however , smear completely the functional structure and so an optimum moment have to be found .",
    "we have to comment here that in order to increase the resolution of the basis set with respect to the thermally populated energy near the threshold ( for @xmath125 , n is usually 10 ) , we inserted a small energy grid ( typically 50 - 100 basis functions ) with constant energy step at close - to - threshold energies .",
    "+ in figure a2 the resulted energy shifts are plotted as a function of the tolerance parameter for the various moment orders .",
    "the numerically exact value which was calculated using the perturbative method is @xmath126 . the values for moment order above the @xmath127 , convergence to this values within less",
    "then 5% for tolerance value of @xmath128 . the basis set that was taken in this paper uses @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "larger moments than the chosen exhibit slower convergence and demand much smaller values of @xmath131 to produce an adequate basis set .",
    "+    we must remark also , that the only physical parameter which demands such a care in the sampling is the energy shift .",
    "the values for the lifetime are much less influenced by the size of the basis , and converged even at @xmath131 as small as @xmath132 . to demonstrate the importance of very large energy scale that are needed to calculate the energy shift correctly we present in figure a3 the calculated energy shift as a function of @xmath121 the upper bound of the energy grid .",
    "convergence of the energy shift is achieved only when reaching hundreds of kelvins .",
    "note , again , that only the energy shift exhibit a sensitivity for such high energies . for low laser",
    "intensities the lifetime is found to converge @xmath121 at the order of the thermal energy grid .",
    "convergence near the saturation limit demands extension of the grid up to the first minimum of the coupling profile , i.e.,@xmath133 , or tens of milikelvins .",
    "a basis set for such energies contained less then 150 function and is adequate for calculating most of the lineshapes features , except for energy shifts ."
