    "glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) is the simplest amino acid and a key constituent of living organisms .",
    "it is believed that its formation may have occurred in the interstellar medium ( ism ) since glycine and other amino acids have been found in meteorites @xcite and comets ( wild 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "laboratory experiments have also reported the formation of amino acids , including glycine , via ultraviolet ( uv ) and ion photolysis of interstellar ice analogues @xcite , supporting the idea that amino acids may have an interstellar origin @xcite .",
    "the detection of glycine is thus key to understand the formation of pre - biotic molecules in the ism and their subsequent delivery onto planetary systems",
    ".    over a decade glycine has extensively been searched for in high - mass star forming regions such as the hot molecular cores in sgrb2 , orion kl and w51 e1/e2 @xcite .",
    "hot cores , with temperatures @xmath1100 - 200@xmath3k , show a rich chemistry in complex organic molecules ( coms ) due to the evaporation of ices from dust grains @xcite .",
    "however , although glycine is expected to be released into the gas phase together with other coms @xcite , none of the studies performed to detect glycine in hot cores yielded any firm detection @xcite .",
    "several challenges are faced in the search of glycine in hot cores .",
    "first , the spectral line density in these objects is high , leading to high levels of line blending and line confusion .",
    "second , the linewidths of the molecular line emission in hot cores are broad ( several km@xmath3s@xmath4 ) , which prevents clear identifications of weak lines from less abundant species . finally , hot cores are typically located at distances @xmath51@xmath3kpc @xcite and beam dilution limits the detection of low - abundance , large coms such as glycine .",
    "in contrast with their high - mass counterparts , low - mass star forming regions may be better suited for the detection of glycine for several reasons .",
    "the level of line confusion , especially at the earliest stages represented by pre - stellar cores @xcite , is low because the measured gas temperatures are @xmath610@xmath3k @xcite and the number of molecular lines excited at these temperatures is smaller than in hot cores .",
    "the molecular emission in dark cloud cores also shows linewidths @xmath60.5@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows accurate identifications of the observed transitions since they suffer less from line blending .",
    "coms such as propylene ( ch@xmath0chch@xmath7 ) , acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath7cho ) , dimethyl ether ( ch@xmath7och@xmath7 ) or methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath7 ) have indeed been detected in dark cloud cores such as tmc-1 and b1 @xcite and the pre - stellar core l1689b @xcite , unexpectedly revealing a high chemical complexity in the cold gas of these objects .",
    "previous studies toward hot cores mainly targeted glycine lines with frequencies @xmath5130@xmath3ghz because their einstein @xmath8 coefficients , @xmath9 , are @xmath9@xmath510@xmath10@xmath3s@xmath4 , and their upper level energies are e@xmath11@xmath560@xmath3k , in agreement with the temperatures in these objects @xcite .",
    "however , for pre - stellar cores , the detection of glycine should be attempted via observations of glycine lines with low values of e@xmath11 while having _ not too small _ @xmath9 coefficients . in the frequency range between 60@xmath3ghz and 130@xmath3ghz , glycine ( conformer i ) ( @xmath11000 k ) above that of conformer i. ] has several transitions whose energy levels lie below 30@xmath3k and whose @xmath9 coefficients are @xmath510@xmath12 s@xmath4 , only a factor of 10 lower than those of the glycine lines observed in hot cores @xcite . in this letter , we test the detectability of glycine toward a well - known pre - stellar core , l1544 @xcite , by performing simple radiative transfer calculations of glycine between 60@xmath3ghz and 250@xmath3ghz , and by making reasonable assumptions of the dominant chemical processes in pre - stellar cores and of the abundance of glycine on ices and in the gas phase .",
    "for our calculations , we have considered the l1544 pre - stellar core located in the taurus molecular cloud ( distance of 140@xmath3pc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this core has largely been studied in the past and its internal physical structure is relatively well - constrained @xcite .",
    "figure@xmath3[f1 ] reports the 1d spherically symmetric distribution of the h@xmath0 density , @xmath13 , and gas temperature , @xmath14 , derived by @xcite for this core , and considered in our calculations .",
    "we have also included in the model the gas velocity profile ( due to the subsonic phase of the core contraction ) and the linewidth of the emission deduced by @xcite .",
    "l1544 represents an excellent candidate for our analysis of the detectability of glycine in pre - stellar cores because water vapour has recently been found toward the central few thousand au of this core @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the gas - phase water abundance , @xmath15(h@xmath0o ) , is shown in figure@xmath3[f1 ] ( blue line ) , where @xmath15(h@xmath0o ) increases by a factor of @xmath5100 within the central 10000@xmath3au ( from @xmath12@xmath1610@xmath17 to @xmath13@xmath1610@xmath18 ) to decrease again to @xmath110@xmath19 . as proposed by @xcite , water vapour in l1544 ( with @xmath10.5% of the total water abundance on ices injected into the gas phase )",
    "is produced by the internal fuv field induced by the impact of cosmic rays with h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "the models of @xcite do not include the gas - phase chemistry of water .",
    "however , their simple calculations not only recover the results from the comprehensive gas - grain models of @xcite , but also reproduce the inverse p - cygni profile observed for water in this core . since gas - phase chemistry is not the dominant process in the production of water vapour in l1544 @xcite , we assume that it is mostly produced by comic ray induced fuv photons .",
    "we note that this is consistent with the depletion of co in l1544 ( by a factor of 100 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since a higher co desorption rate ( 30 times higher than that used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is needed to explain the observed c@xmath20o and c@xmath21o lines @xcite .",
    "this indicates that co is still present in the gas phase in the core center as a result of the ice photodesorption by cosmic ray induced fuv photons @xcite .",

    "the radial distribution of water vapour , @xmath15(h@xmath0o ) , was inferred by @xcite from herschel hifi data ( blue line ) .",
    "the glycine abundance , @xmath15(gly ) , is assumed to follow the distribution of water vapour in l1544 , but scaled down by the fraction of solid glycine expected to be formed on ices ( red line ; see sections@xmath3[mod ] and [ gly]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        in our calculations , we also consider that glycine is fuv photo - desorbed together with water in l1544 .",
    "multilayer simulations of ice mantle formation indeed show that complex organics ( e.g. methanol and formaldehyde ) are formed in the outer layers of the mantle , while water is uniformingly distributed across these layers @xcite .",
    "therefore , most of the complex organics are expected to be released alongside with water once the mantle outer layers are photo - desorbednm and 200@xmath3 nm @xcite . ] . from this , the distribution of gas phase glycine is assumed to follow the water vapour abundance profile deduced in l1544 ( see discussion in section@xmath3[gly ] ) , but scaled down by the fraction of solid glycine expected to be formed on ices .",
    "this can be calculated as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the abundance of solid glycine on ices , @xmath24 is the water abundance ( relative to h@xmath0 ) in the mantles ( @xmath24=7.25@xmath1610@xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath25 is the distribution of gas phase water in l1544 @xcite .",
    "we assume a solid glycine abundance of @xmath23@xmath110@xmath2 with respect to water on ices ( @xmath110@xmath19 with respect to h@xmath0 ; see section@xmath3[gly ] ) .    as shown in figure@xmath3[f1 ] , the maximum gas - phase abundance of glycine reached in the model ( red line ) is @xmath26@xmath13@xmath1610@xmath27 , which corresponds to column densities @xmath110@xmath28@xmath3@xmath29 .",
    "this glycine abundance is reasonable since it is a factor of @xmath1100 lower than that of amino acetonitrile ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cn , a precursor of glycine ) measured in sgrb2(n ) ( of @xmath12@xmath1610@xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance ratio @xmath30@xmath1@xmath31 is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio between acetic acid and methyl cyanide in sgrb2(n ) ( @xmath32@xmath1@xmath33 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected if the pairs glycine / amino - acetonitrile and acetic - acid / methyl - cyanide were formed by similar chemical pathways .",
    "the spectrum of glycine is obtained toward the core peak position considering spherical symmetry and lte conditions .",
    "the 1d radiative transfer model follows the procedure described in @xcite and @xcite , which was used for pre - stellar cores .",
    "the column density of glycine and the optical depth of every line are calculated as a function of radius and the radiative transfer is performed along the line - of - sight considering the core s velocity profile and linewidth of the emission at every position .",
    "the spectroscopic information of glycine is extracted from the cdms @xcite .",
    "non - lte calculations are not possible due to the lack of collisional coefficients of glycine with he or h@xmath0 . assuming that these coefficients are of the same order as those derived for methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath7 , coefficients of @xmath12 - 3@xmath1610@xmath27@xmath3@xmath34@xmath3s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the estimated critical density for the glycine lines is @xmath35@xmath15 - 7@xmath1610@xmath36@xmath3@xmath37 , similar to the average h@xmath0 density measured toward l1544 ( n(h@xmath0)@xmath17@xmath1610@xmath36@xmath3@xmath37 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the glycine emission is probably not far from lte .      in figure@xmath3[f2 ]",
    "( upper panel ) , we show the simulated spectrum of glycine obtained between 60@xmath3ghz and 250@xmath3ghz considering the physical and kinematic structure of l1544 ( section@xmath3[mod ] ) .",
    "while the lines at 1@xmath3 mm and 2@xmath3 mm show brightness temperatures @xmath65@xmath3mk , the 3@xmath3 mm and 4@xmath3 mm transitions ( from 60@xmath3ghz to 80@xmath3ghz ) have peak intensities @xmath510@xmath3mk .",
    "the brighter emission at 3@xmath3 mm and 4@xmath3 mm is due to the combination of low values of e@xmath11 ( @xmath630 k ) and large upper level degeneracies , @xmath38 , for these lines .",
    "since e@xmath11 progressively increases for higher frequencies , the higher energy levels are more difficult to populate making their expected line intensities very low .",
    "the glycine emission is optically thin across the core because the maximum optical depths attained for the brightest glycine lines are @xmath610@xmath2 .",
    "since the glycine emission is extended across the core , this emission is expected to fill the beam of the telescope and the brightness temperature , t@xmath39 , will be similar to the main beam temperature , t@xmath40 , measured by the telescope ( t@xmath39@xmath1t@xmath40 , beam - filling factor @xmath11 ) .",
    "this has also been considered in previous studies of pre - stellar cores where radiative transfer calculations were compared to observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , our simulations show that _ for reasonable abundances of glycine in the gas - phase , the glycine lines could reach detectable levels in pre - stellar cores between 60@xmath3ghz and 80@xmath3ghz .",
    "_    we note that even if glycine did not follow the gas - phase water profile deduced for l1544 @xcite , peak intensities @xmath510@xmath3mk would still be measured between 60@xmath3ghz and 80@xmath3ghz if a constant glycine abundance of 1.5@xmath1610@xmath27 were present in the gas phase in this core .",

    ". therefore , even if glycine were not photo - desorbed from ices in l1544 , column densities of @xmath110@xmath28@xmath3@xmath29 could still be found in the gas phase assuming a 1% efficiency for the desorption of glycine via cosmic ray impacts @xcite and/or exothermic surface reactions @xcite .",
    "these column densities are similar to those considered in our modelling ( section@xmath3[res ] ) .",
    "the destruction rate of glycine by pure gas - phase reactions at low temperatures ( mainly with h@xmath7@xmath59 , h@xmath7o@xmath59 and hco@xmath59 ) is expected to decrease the abundance of this molecule by a factor of 10 in @xmath12@xmath1610@xmath56@xmath3yrs ( as derived for methyl formate , a precursor of glycine , for which its gas phase reaction rates are relatively well - constrained ) . however , in the cold gas of pre - stellar cores , other processes such as surface diffusion by tunneling effects of atomic oxygen @xcite , cosmic rays induced diffusion ( or crid ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and episodic chemical explosions on ices @xcite could also enhance the abundance of coms by factors from a few to @xmath11000 in both the gas phase and on ices @xcite .",

    "shows that the 3@xmath3 mm and 4@xmath3 mm glycine lines are factors @xmath13 - 15 weaker in hot sources than in cold objects .",
    "this is due to : i ) the lower efficiency to populate the low energy levels of glycine at temperatures @xmath5130@xmath3k ; and ii ) the large beam dilution produced by the single - dish telescope . if observed with interferometers ( beam sizes @xmath17 - 17@xmath61 , as in",

    "as noted in section@xmath3[intro ] , the presence of more abundant coms in hot cores whose emission has linewidths of some km@xmath3s@xmath4 , is a major issue in the detection / identification of glycine in hot sources due to line blending and line confusion .",
