    "@xcite discuss a graphical approach to conditional independence .",
    "a probabilistic influence diagram is a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) that helps to model statistical problems .",
    "the graph is composed of a set of nodes or vertices , representing the variables , and a set of arcs joining the nodes , representing the dependence relationships shared by these variables .",
    "the construction of the model helps to understand the problem and gives a good representation of interdependence of the variables involved in the problem .",
    "the joint probability of these variable can be written as a product of conditional distributions , based on the relationships of independence and conditional independence among the variables involved in the problem .",
    "sometimes the interdependence of the variables is not known , and in this case , the model structure is required to be learnt from data .",
    "algorithms such as the _ ic - algorithm ( inferred causation ) _ described in @xcite are designed to uncover these structures from data .",
    "this algorithm uses a series of ci tests to remove and direct the arcs connecting the variables in the model , returning a dag that minimally ( with the minimum number of parameters , without loss of information ) represents the variables in the problem .",
    "the problem of learning dag structures from data motivates the proposal of new powerful statistical tests for the hypothesis of conditional independence , since the accuracy of structures learnt are directly affected by errors committed by these tests .",
    "recently proposed structure learning algorithms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate as main source of errors the results of ci tests .    in this paper , we propose the full bayesian significance test ( fbst ) for tests of conditional independence for discrete datasets .",
    "fbst is a powerful bayesian test for precise hypothesis , and can be used to learn dag structures from data , as an alternative to ci test currently used , such as _ pearson s _ @xmath0 _",
