    "among close binary stars there are cataclysmic variables a containing white dwarf ( the primary ) and a main - sequence star ( the secondary or the donor ) .",
    "the primary accretes matter from the donor star through the inner lagrangian point . in non - magnetic systems",
    "the material forms an accretion disk around the primary .",
    "one of the subclasses of cataclysmic variables are dwarf novae and among them there are su uma type stars .",
    "they can be characterized by short orbital period ( @xmath1 h ) and in their light curves we see two types of outbursts : normal and superoutbursts .",
    "outbursts are about one magnitude fainter and last shorter than superoutbursts .",
    "tooth - shaped oscillations called superhumps manifest their presence during superoutburts ( hellier 2001 ) .",
    "ht cas was discovered 70 years ago and classified as a variable star ( hoffmeister 1943 ) .",
    "unfortunately , for 35 years this object did not received any attention , until the eclipses of ht cas were noticed ( discovery made by bond in 1978 , private communication with patterson ) and this amazing dwarf nova became a top priority object for observing season organized in 1978 .",
    "patterson called ht cas `` a rosetta stone among dwarf novae '' because of the variety of manifested features presented in light curves ( patterson 1981 ) . over 30 years since this statement literature concerning ht cas is still growing , reaching several dozens of publications .",
    "we present observations of superoutburst in ht cas made during 21 nights .",
    "data were collected between 2nd and 27th of november . during this world - wide campagin five observers were gathering observations in four countries : poland , turkey , spain and usa , and",
    "eight telescopes with diameters ranging from 10 to 100 cm were used simultaneously .",
    "moreover , data collected by aavso organization were used for this analysis .",
    "ht cas was monitored in clear filter ( `` white '' light ) .",
    "bias , dark current and flat - field correction was made using iraf package .",
    "profile photometry was obtained with daophotii ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "relative manitudes were transform to the standard johnson v manitudes using data published by henden and honeycutt ( 1997 ) . in fig.[f1 ] there are presented resulting light curves from our observing campaign .",
    "the superoutburst lasted 11 nights ( 3rd-13th nov ) and we gathered data covering almost whole this period except of the last night of the superoutburst .",
    "ht cas reached maximum brightness of @xmath2 mag and the amplitude of this superoutburst was about @xmath3 mag .",
    "the @xmath0 diagram is an excellent tool to check the stability of superhump or orbital period and to determine their values .",
    "we analyzed light curves from 10 subsequent nights where superhumps clearly manifested their presents and we identified 69 moments of maxima .",
    "the least squares linear fit to the gathered data gave the following ephemeris for the maxima :    @xmath4    one can observe the decreasing trend of superhump period presented in fig.[f2 ] . due to this fact the second - order polynomial fit to the moments of maxima was derived and the following ephemeris was obtained :    @xmath5    based on those calculations , we can confirm that the period of superhumps was not stable and can be described by a decreasing trend with a rate of _ _ p__=@xmath6 .    to obtain the value of orbital period we constructed the @xmath0 diagram for the moments of minima . in total the timings of 70 eclipses from november 2010 superoutburst were used to calculate the following ephemeris of the minima :    @xmath7    there is a relation between superhump and orbital period ( osaki 1985 ) : @xmath8 and we used eq.[eq3 ] to calculate the beat period of @xmath9 days .",
    "this value is in full agreement with previous results presented by zhang et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for the superoutburst in ht cas in 1985 . in fig.[f3",
    "] one can observe regular humps near cycles : 18 , 47 and 80 , we checked those features and it is beat period manifestation .",
    "we used values of superhump @xmath10 and orbital @xmath11 periods to calculate the period excess @xmath12 which can be obtained based on formula :    @xmath13    based on eq.[eq4 ] the value of period excess for ht cas is @xmath14 and it is a typical value for su uma - type stars .",
    "there is an empirical formula with the relation between period excess and mass ratio of the binary @xmath15 ( patterson 1998 ) :    @xmath16    based on eq.[eq5 ] the mass ratio of ht cas with the value of @xmath17 was obtained .",
    "to summarize the results of the autumn 2010 observations of the ht cas we can confirm :    * after 25 years of quiescence or normal outbursts in november 2010 the superoutburst in ht cas was detected .",
    "this rare phenomenon had an amplitude of about @xmath18 mag , lasted 11 nights was triggered by an outburst precursor . *",
    "during superoutburst mesmerizing superhumps manifested their presence and based on them the superhump period with a value of @xmath19 days and decreasing with an rate of _ _ p__@xmath20 was calculated . *",
    "based on the timinings of eclipses observed during superoutburst an orbital period with a value of @xmath21 days was obtained and its value is in full accordance with results presented by other authors from earlier observations ( horne et al .",
    "1991 , feline et al .",
    "1998 , ioannou et al .",
    "1999 , borges et al .",
    "no anomalies in orbital period were detected as it was mentioned by ioannou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or borges et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . * from the november 2010 superoutburst the period excess with value of @xmath22 was obtained and it has typical value for su uma type stars .",
    "the same value of period excess was derived from the superoutburst in 1985 ( zhang et al .",
    "* mass ratio with the value of @xmath17 was calculated and it confirms the result obtained by horne et al .",
    "( 1991 ) where a different method and set of observations were used .",
