    "the study of dissipative systems and in particular of the brownian motion has been pursued for a long time in the context of classical @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "although there has been a number of publications in this area there are some subtle points that have never been properly investigated in the literature . among these",
    "we could mention three major ones ; a careful investigation of the relation between different models @xcite , the existence of dissipative coherent states @xcite or the condition for the employment of factorizable initial conditions .",
    "these are exactly the issues we shall address in this paper .",
    "usually the dissipation in the system is described as a consequence of its coupling to a reservoir .",
    "the properties of this dissipative systems are generally studied through the evaluation of the time evolution of its reduced density operator .",
    "this evolution is often described either by a generalization of the feynman - vernon approach @xcite or through master equations @xcite . in this work the properties of the system",
    "will be studied through exact diagonalization of different hamiltonians of the dissipative models .",
    "we will consider a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the usual models of dissipation consist of coupling the harmonic oscillator to a reservoir that is conveniently chosen as a group of n noninteracting oscillators .",
    "the coupling between the two systems is bilinear in the creation and destruction operators of quanta of energy .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the total system is given by @xcite @xmath0 being @xmath1 where we consider a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath2 ( the system of interest ) interacting with a bath of oscillators with frequencies @xmath3 through the coupling constants @xmath4 s .",
    "we will take the limit of a continuous spectrum of excitations in the reservoir of the hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "then we will diagonalize @xmath5 and determine the time evolution of the operator @xmath6 exactly .",
    "the analysis of @xmath7 will determine the conditions of validity of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) which consists of neglecting the terms @xmath8 in ( [ 1 ] ) and writing @xmath9    once this has been accomplished we will discuss the existence of dissipative coherent states .",
    "some authors @xcite have stated that the coherent states are special states that remain pure during its decay in dissipative systems .",
    "we will show that the existence of these dissipative coherent states is directly related to the rwa ; they can only exist at zero temperature and in systems that meet the conditions required for the rwa .    once we have determined the evolution of the operator @xmath10 of the system we can determine the evolution of any of its observables .",
    "however , the dynamics of these observables will depend on the specific form adopted for the coupling constants @xmath4 as functions of the frequencies @xmath3 .",
    "our method holds for an arbitrary form but in order to compare our results with the caldeira - leggett model @xcite , we will reduce our results to the case where the function becomes the same as the one they have adopted . then , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will determine the evolution of the mean value of the position operator @xmath11 of the damped oscillator .",
    "the result of this calculation reveals a very special need to carefully treat the initial time of the motion .",
    "we propose a simple initial condition that eliminates the initial transient that would appear in the evolution of @xmath11 and we believe that it is enough to eliminate most of or maybe all the initial transients ( in a certain time scale ) which were noticed in this system in previous works @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we write the hamiltonian ( [ 0 ] ) in the limit of a continuous spectrum for the reservoir excitations and we diagonalize it exactly within and without the rwa .",
    "we compare the model given by the hamiltonian ( [ 0 ] ) with the dissipative model presented in @xcite in sec .",
    ", we also determine the relation between the coupling function @xmath12 , introduced in sec .",
    "ii , and the spectral function @xmath13 introduced in @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the relevance of the different terms that appear in the calculation of the evolution of the operator @xmath7 with relation to the intensity of the dissipation in the system . in sec .",
    "v we show under which conditions the evolution of the operator @xmath7 is reduced to that given in the rwa . in sec .",
    "vi we show that the existence of dissipative coherent states is only possible within the rwa . in sec .",
    "vii we present the calculation of the evolution of the mean value of the position of the damped harmonic oscillator . in sec .",
    "viii we discussed the physical meaning of the initial condition proposed in sec.vii .",
    "finally , we discuss the main results and conclusions in sec .",

    "the expressions obtained for the evolution of the operator @xmath10 , within or without the rwa , remained written in terms of the coupling function @xmath12 .",

    "now we can use the transformation ( [ 230 ] ) in order to consider a continuous spectrum for the excitations of the reservoir .",
    "the second term on the rhs of ( [ 42 ] ) becomes @xmath80 and its last term can be written in the following way : @xmath81 now comparing ( [ 42]-[43 ] ) with ( [ 235 ] ) we see that both hamiltonians will be equivalent if we employ @xmath82 taking the square of ( [ 44 ] ) and comparing it with ( [ 303b ] ) we obtain @xmath83 adopting the drude form ( [ 305 ] ) @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 which is defined only for @xmath86 .",
    "now that we have established the form of @xmath87 corresponding to the caldeira - leggett model @xcite , we can determine @xmath88 through ( [ 278 ] ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath89 will be given by @xmath90    we can also diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ 301 ] ) considering the inclusion of the counter - term @xmath69 ( see appendix a ) .",

    "the spectral function ( [ 305 ] ) is appropriate to the description of the reservoir since we consider @xmath96 .",

    "if we had not considered the inclusion of the counter - term in the interaction hamiltonian , we would have @xmath108 given by ( [ 430 ] ) instead of @xmath117 . in this case",

    "these terms can only be neglected if the condition ( [ 431 ] ) , which limits our system to a much weaker dissipation , is satisfied .",

    "we will see later , in more detail , that for a system subject to very weak dissipation the damping coefficient @xmath107 will be given by @xmath156 and the frequency shift by @xmath157 . observing the expression ( [ 278 ] ) for @xmath88",

    "physically what happens is that if the oscillators of the bath are not `` appropriately '' distributed around the particle ( as in the initial condition ( [ 511 ] ) ) , when it is inserted in the bath , these oscillators will `` pull '' the particle until they reach this `` appropriate '' distribution .",
    "this force will act on the particle during a time interval of the order @xmath257 . therefore , in the limit @xmath97 we will have a delta force that will cause a phase difference in the evolution of the system .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath256 in propagator methods must be accompanied by the above - mentioned modification of the factorizable initial condition .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that we are not addressing here the question of the generalized initial condition @xcite .",

    "@xcite of which one of us is co - author .",
    "the referred article considers an initial condition of the system when the bath of oscillators meets thermodynamical equilibrium with the particle at the position it is placed in the bath . in this case one obtains mean values of the position @xmath11 and momentum @xmath261 which depend on the temperature of the reservoir and that do not exactly coincide with their classical counterparts .",
    "this disagreement was justified within a classical analysis of the model . in this analysis",
    "it was affirmed that the classical initial condition equivalent to the proposed quantum initial state , that corresponds exactly to @xmath262 , would imply in a classical solution of the model different from the trajectories of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "we saw in the present work that this is not true and therefore this argument can not be used .",
    "we believe that the origin of the disagreement when adopting a non - factorizable initial condition is the impossibility to describe the evolution of the system through an independent sum of functions of the system and reservoir variables as in ( [ 502 ] ) .",
    "the quantum effects of the correlation between the variables of the system and reservoir prevent a direct comparison of the quantum mean values with the values obtained through the classical analysis of the model .",
    "accordingly , it can be shown that the discrepancy vanishes in the classical limit @xmath263 .",
    "after we had made the above analysis we became aware that in previous works @xcite the authors had also noticed the existence of initials kicks and jolts in this system when the initial condition ( [ 501],[503 ] ) is used . in both works the existence of an initial kick , given by ( [ 512 ] ) in the limit limite @xmath194 , is noticed ( eqs .",
    "( 3.2 ) and ( 45 ) , respectively ) .",
    "however , the existence of this initial transient is considered as a characteristic of the model to be taken into account . in our analysis",
    "we see that although the existence of the kick given by ( [ 512 ] ) is a real characteristic of the model when it is subject to the initial condition ( [ 501],[503 ] ) it is an undesirable feature that should be corrected .",
    "fortunately , this correction can be made even with an improved factorizable initial condition , that is , ( [ 501],[523 ] ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite have recognized that the presence of initial jolts , in their master equation coefficients , generates certain non - physical effects and so they suppose that they are due the adoption of a factorizable initial condition . in @xcite",
    "the evolution of the system is analyzed for a non - factorizable initial condition , similar to the one used in @xcite and @xcite , in which the initial position of the particle is defined by a measurement process in a state in thermodynamic equilibrium with the bath .",
    "however , the initial jolts in the time scale @xmath257 still persists .",
    "we believe that this happens because this initial condition does not satisfy ( [ 523 ] ) when the initial mean values of the position of the particle and the oscillators in the bath are calculated .",
    "thus , in this aspect , it is less general than the improved factorizable initial condition that we considered .    actually the initial jolt , at least the one they attribute to the decoherence process ( however see discussion below ) , does not appear in the more general initial condition later adopted in @xcite .",
    "it is an initial condition prepared by a dynamic process in a finite time @xmath264 . in this case",
    "we can consider that the condition ( [ 523 ] ) will be satisfied since @xmath265 . indeed in this situation @xmath266",
    ", it was shown that the initial jolt does not appear .",
    "thus , we believe that the initial condition ( [ 523 ] ) is enough to eliminate most of or maybe all the initial transients that would appear in this system in the characteristic time scale @xmath257 . however , another initial transient in this system is also known .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for a factorizable initial state in the high temperature limit @xmath267 of the master equation it presents an initial transient within the time scale of the internal decoherence of the initial wave packet .",
    "if applied to times shorter than this it can lead to nonsensical results .",
    "we believe that this pathology can only be really corrected with the adoption of non - factorizable initial conditions .",
    "in this paper we have applied the fano diagonalization procedure to two hamiltonians commonly used as models for dissipative systems in quantum optics and in condensed matter systems ; the rotating wave and the coordinate - coordinate coupling models , respectively .    by exactly diagonalizing these two models",
    "we have succeeded in showing how the rwa turns out to be the extremely underdamped limit of the more general coordinate - coordinate coupling model .",
    "we have also been able to analyze the role played by the counter - term in this limiting procedure from the latter to the rwa .",
    "we have shown through the evaluation of the destruction operator @xmath7 of the system that the rwa is a good approximation for ( [ 0 ] ) if and only if the conditions ( [ 436 ] ) and ( [ 433 ] ) are satisfied . for certain choices of @xmath268",
    ", we have @xmath269 and the fulfillment of ( [ 436 ] ) automatically implies ( [ 433 ] ) .",
    "however , for other choices , we can have @xmath270 and ( [ 433 ] ) limits the validity of the approximation .",
    "once these conditions are satisfied , we have shown that the time evolution of the system is identical to that determined within the rwa , with the exception of the frequency shift .",
    "we have found that this shift will be given by @xmath183 instead of @xmath181 . as we have shown these functions",
    "usually have the same order of magnitude , but they are not identical . for functions",
    "@xmath12 that extend to frequencies much larger than @xmath2 we have @xmath271 .    the comparison of the hamiltonian ( [ 235 ] ) with the hamiltonian of the coordinate - coordinate coupling model established the relation ( [ 46 ] ) between the spectral function @xmath13 of this model and the coupling function @xmath12 . in the case of ohmic dissipation and",
    "considering the inclusion of the counter - term , we find that @xmath272 in the limit @xmath194 .",
    "then the only condition required for the rwa to be valid is @xmath273    as an application of this method , we have studied the existence of dissipative coherent states and concluded that it can only exist within the rwa and when thermal fluctuations are neglegible .",
    "when these conditions are not met , the initial state will in the long run become a statistical mixture .",
    "finally , we have also addressed the question of the discrepancies in the time evolution of the observables of the system that arise when the factorizable initial conditions are not properly accounted for .",
