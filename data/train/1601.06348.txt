    "stellar magnetic activity cycle , in particular the solar one , has been investigated in an elaborative manner with several types of dynamo model @xcite . depending on the ingredients of the models , such as the field - generation mechanism , location for the dynamo action to work , role of the large - scale flows ,",
    "etc . , the dynamo model may be classified into several categories or classes .",
    "the mean - field @xmath0@xmath1 dynamos @xcite , the interface dynamos @xcite , the flux - transport dynamos @xcite , the nonlinear dynamic dynamos @xcite , are representative ones .    among others , the migrating mean - field dynamo mechanism",
    "@xcite has been paid considerable attentions because of the novelty of its physical insights and the simplicity of the model structure . in the presence of helical properties of fluid motions , magnetic fields moving in the fluid",
    "can be twisted , leading to a possibility of the magnetic - field configuration that is perpendicular to the original magnetic - field one @xcite .",
    "this effect is usually called the @xmath0 effect . under this effect",
    ", the poloidal field can be generated from the twisted toroidal magnetic field .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 effect , if fluid motions perpendicular to the magnetic field are nonuniform with respect to the magnetic - field direction , the magnetic field advected by the inhomogeneous flow leads to a magnetic - field configuration that is perpendicular to the original one .",
    "this differential - rotation effect is often called the @xmath1 effect .",
    "if the toroidal flow in the solar convection zone is nonuniform along the latitudinal direction , a toroidal magnetic field can be produced from a poloidal one .",
    "combination of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effects may lead to an oscillational behavior of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic - field components . on the basis of this notion ,",
    "@xcite constructed a system of equations for the poloidal and toroidal magnetic - field components represented by the toroidal component of the vector potential , @xmath4 , and the toroidal component of the magnetic field , @xmath5 . in this system of equations ( parker equations ) , the statistical properties of small - scale or turbulent motions",
    "are represented by two transport coefficients , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 are obtained with the aid of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence closure theory .",
    "the expressions of @xmath0 and @xmath2 depend on the closure theory adopted , ranging from simplest parameter expressions with no closure to elaborated ones based on a sophisticated mhd theory and modeling .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 represents the helical properties of turbulence . on the other hand , @xmath2 represents the enhanced or effective magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence . this effect",
    "is often called the turbulent magnetic diffusivity or anomalous resistivity . under the assumption that the magnetic reynolds number is low ( @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 : characteristic velocity , @xmath9 : characteristic length , and @xmath10 : magnetic diffusivity )",
    ", @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the turbulent kinetic helicity @xmath11 [ @xmath12 : velocity fluctuation , @xmath13 : vorticity fluctuation , @xmath14 : ensemble average ] .",
    "however , it is well - known that in the high-@xmath15 case , which is much more relevant to astrophysical phenomena , @xmath0 is expressed not only by the kinetic helicity but also with the correction due to the turbulent current helicity @xmath16 [ @xmath17 : magnetic - field fluctuation , @xmath18 : electric - current density fluctuation ] @xcite . since @xmath0 and @xmath2 represent how much magnetic field is generated and destroyed by turbulence , respectively , the evaluations of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , as well as the spatiotemporal distribution and evolution of the differential rotation , are essential information for the evolution of the parker s equations . for a review of mhd",
    "closure theories in dynamos and more elaborated analysis of the inhomogeneous mhd turbulence , see @xcite .",
    "not a few studies have been done in this framework of the parker equations . by assuming some flow configurations compatible with the observation then ,",
    "@xcite succeeded in numerically reproducing the latitudinal evolution of the toroidal magnetic field ( butterfly diagram ) . in order to obtain the equatorward migration of the toroidal magnetic field , it is required that the angular velocity should decrease as the radius increases in the solar convection zone ( @xmath19 for the positive @xmath0 in the northern hemisphere , @xmath20 : angular velocity ) .",
    "however , the developments of helioseismology revealed that the real radial distribution of the angular velocity in the solar convective zone does not satisfy this requirement .",
    "in addition to this point , parker himself argued the limitation of the @xmath0 dynamo in the solar convection zone from the viewpoint of magnetic - field buoyancy @xcite .",
    "once the magnitude of a magnetic field has been amplified to some level , the magnetic flux tube starts moving upward from deeper to shallower regions . since this buoyancy convection timescale , even for a very weak magnetic flux tube , is estimated very short as compared with the @xmath0-dynamo amplification timescale , it reaches the solar surface without being sufficiently amplified by the dynamo .",
    "this is called the magnetic buoyancy dilemma intrinsic to the magnetic flux tube .",
    "these difficulties have been considered to be obviated by assuming that the dynamo action is operated in a convectively stable thin layer between the radiative and convection zones @xcite .",
    "this region is associated with a large differential rotation and is called the _",
    "tachocline_. in the tachocline dynamo picture , the solar magnetic field is generated by a strong differential rotation there , and may have enough time to be amplified by the @xmath0 dynamo before it rises up by the magnetic buoyancy @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , depending on the location of the field generation , the dynamo models are divided into two types ; ( i ) the flux - transport dynamo , which operates in the overshoot layer below the bottom of convection zone ; and ( ii ) the mean - field distributed dynamo , which works in the bulk of the convection zone in particular at the subsurface shear layer .    on the surface of the sun ,",
    "large - scale meridional circulations with the speed of @xmath21 15  m  s@xmath22 in the poleward direction have been observed .",
    "the combination of the meridional circulation and the @xmath0@xmath1 mean - field model demonstrated its ability to reproduce the basic features of the solar magnetic activity cycle such as the equatorward migration of the sunspots , the cycle period , the phase difference between the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields . in the combination with meridional circulations or convective - diffusive motions such as the babcock  leighton - type convection , which produces the east - west tilt of the sunspot pairs under the action of the coriolis force on the magnetic flux tube during its rise through the convection zone",
    ", it is expected that the tachocline dynamo can reproduce several properties of solar activity cycle @xcite .",
    "this approach is called the flux - transport dynamo . in practical numerical simulations of the model ,",
    "the large - scale fluid motion is fixed according to the helioseismology observation data .",
    "it should be noted that the thin flux tube simulations by @xcite showed that , with their initial and boundary conditions , the magnetic field energy is greater than the turbulent equipartition energy inside the convection zone , so it is hard for the toroidal field lines represented by the flux tube to be twisted by the helical turbulence .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0@xmath1 dynamo is unlikely to operate to the flux tube inside the solar convection zone . at the same time",
    ", there are some unresolved problems on the flux - transport model results from the active - region observations , which include that ( i ) emerging bipolar active regions have not tilt , which is developed after while @xcite ; ( ii ) the evolution of tilt depend on the size of the active regions @xcite ; ( iii ) the active regions rotate slower than surrounding plasma with angular velocity that corresponds to the near - surface shear layer @xcite ; ( iv ) the most effect to the relative sunspot number comes from small active regions @xcite ; ( v ) the long - term evolution of tilt in the solar cycle is still open @xcite .    as for the meridional circulation , however , its spatial pattern is still observationally open .",
    "it has been reported that the behavior of dynamo magnetic field highly depends on the flow pattern of the meridional circulation adopted in the numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "the current observational status are seen in @xcite .",
    "the flux transport dynamo with very complicated meridional flow patterns was investigated , and it was shown that if an equatorward flow in low latitudes at the bottom of the convective zone is present , the flux transport dynamo works even in the case of a meridional circulation with very complicated flow structures @xcite .",
    "similar works are seen for dynamos with double and multiple cells @xcite , and dynamos in the global 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "apart from the practical predictability of the solar - activity cycle , there are still open issues in the flux - transport dynamo models .",
    "some of them are related to the evaluation of spatiotemporal distributions of turbulence , its effects and boundary conditions in the solar convection zone .",
    "for example , one of the essential ingredients of the flux - transport dynamo in general is the requirement for the spatial distribution of the effective or turbulent magnetic diffusivity : the turbulent magnetic diffusivity should decrease as the radial position becomes deeper .",
    "because of this requirement , the magnetic field moves in the equatorward direction reflecting the large - scale circulation motion in the deeper region .",
    "otherwise , the magnetic field may move in the poleward direction reflecting the circulation motion in the shallow region .    as has been seen in",
    "the above descriptions on the radial dependence of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath2 , basic behaviors of the large - scale magnetic field highly depend on the turbulent transport coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath2 , whose spatiotemporal evolutions are still not fully understood . in the current flux - transport dynamo model ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath2 is prescribed , and the turbulent helicity - related transport coefficient @xmath0 is often treated as an adjustable parameter . an interesting point is the role of the magnetic fluctuations in magnetic - field reversal @xcite . by comparing the observation of the photospheric magnetic - field data with the predictions from a simple dynamo model with magnetic fluctuations , it was shown that the magnetic fluctuation level is highly connected with the behavior of the solar dipole during the polarity reversal @xcite .",
    "one possible alternative approach is to consider the spatiotemporal distributions of @xmath0 and/or @xmath2 by solving the transport equations of them . since the evolutions of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "depend on the mean fields , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , etc .",
    ", the inclusion of the transport equations of them enables the incorporation of the nonlinear dynamics of dynamo into the model . in this line of thought",
    ", @xcite introduced the dynamic part of the @xmath0 coefficient , @xmath25 , in addition to the given kinetic part @xmath26 , and constructed a simple transport equation of @xmath25 . by solving the equation of @xmath25 as well as the equations for the toroidal components of the vector potential and magnetic field , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", the phase difference between the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields was reproduced in the numerical simulation .",
    "related to the inviscid invariance of the total magnetic helicity @xmath29 , it has some meaning to construct a transport equation of the current helicity density @xmath30 part of @xmath0 , @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite adopted a simple model equation for @xmath31 and estimated the magnitude of the dynamo - generated magnetic field in the solar - type convection zones .    in this paper , we suggest a new dynamo mechanism without showing any preference to the flux - transport dynamo scenario itself .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the inhomogeneous large - scale flow effect on the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) . as we see in the following section , such an effect in the turbulent emf",
    "is represented by the turbulent cross helicity ( cross - correlation between the velocity and magnetic fluctuations ) coupled with the mean or large - scale vorticity . unlike the helicity and energy - related transport coefficients , @xmath0 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the cross - helicity - related transport coefficient , @xmath3 , does change its sign during the magnetic - field reversal . in this sense",
    ", the spatiotemporal behaviors of the turbulent cross helicity is directly connected to the evolution of magnetic fields including the polarity reversal .",
    "the cross helicity itself has been investigated in several contexts in space and astrophysical turbulence @xcite .",
    "plasma relaxation with a cross - helicity constraint @xcite , the large - scale behavior of cross helicity in the solar - wind turbulence @xcite , and the trasnport enhancement and suppression in the turbulent magnetic reconnection @xcite are representative subjects of such investigations . in the context of the solar dynamo and activity cycle ,",
    "some studies have been done related to the cross helicity . on the basis of an expression for the turbulent cross - helicity and/or the evolution equation of the turbulent cross helicity , the dynamic evolution of the turbulent cross helicity under the effects of the density stratification , large - scale magnetic fields , differential rotation , etc .  were examined in the frameworks of a mean - field dynamo and of a flux - transport dynamo @xcite . an attempt to measure the cross helicity on the surface of the sun by observation has been also reported @xcite .",
    "a dynamo model , where the poloidal and toroidal magnetic - fields are induced by the helicity and cross - helicity effects , respectively , had been applied to the solar magnetic - field reversal problem @xcite .",
    "although the dynamics of the toroidal - field evolution was not solved there , an oscillational behavior of the magnetic field was predicted with the aid of a very simple toy model . with this point in mind , in addition to the mean magnetic - field equations , in this work we shall include the transport equation of the turbulent cross helicity rather than the counterparts of the turbulent energy and/or helicity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we point out the importance of the mean - flow inhomogeneity in treating turbulence , and how this inhomogeneity leads to the cross - helicity effect . in section  [ sec:3 ] , the dynamo equations with the cross - helicity effect are presented and reduced to the simplest form with several assumptions and boundary conditions . in section  [ sec:4 ] ,",

    "the concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "the inhomogeneities of the mean or large - scale fields are important ingredients providing a free - energy source for turbulence .",
    "for example , the mean - velocity shear , or strictly speaking , the mean - velocity strain , is considered to be one of the key ingredients producing turbulent energy . in the absence of the large - scale flow shear , we need some external source or forcing to generate and sustain turbulence . here , we focus on the mean - flow inhomogeneity in dynamo and turbulence , and examine the resultant effect on the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) in the global magnetic - field equation .      the equation of the mean magnetic field @xmath23 is written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean velocity , @xmath10 is the molecular magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath34 is the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) defined by @xmath35 ( @xmath12 : velocity fluctuation , @xmath17 : magnetic fluctuation , @xmath36 : ensemble average ) , which represents the turbulence effect in the mean magnetic - field induction . in the first term of eq .",

    "the second term represents the mean magnetic - field reduction ( or induction ) due to the divergence ( @xmath39 ) [ or convergence ( @xmath40 ) ] of the mean velocity .",
