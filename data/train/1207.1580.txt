    "many systems of polynomial equations which are of practical interest can be represented by a graph .",
    "an important example occurs in computer aided design ( cad ) when the location of the geometric elements in a drawing such as points and lines ( corresponding to vertices in the graph ) are determined by relationships between them such as tangency , coincidence and the relative separations or angles between them ( corresponding to edges in the graph ) .",
    "the ability to solve such systems of equations rapidly allows a design engineer to modify input parameters such as the values for the separations or angles ( collectively called `` dimensions '' in a dimensioned drawing ) and to realise a computer model for many variants of a basic design @xcite .",
    "most modern cad systems incorporate the ability to solve these so - called dimensional constraint equations , see for example @xcite .",
    "a simple example of dimensional constraint equations is provided by points in a plane with certain specified relative distances .",
    "both the equations and a particular solution can be represented by a framework @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a graph and @xmath2 is a vector comprising of all the coordinates of the points .",
    "the graph @xmath1 has a vertex for each point and an edge for each specified distance .",
    "since the coordinates of the points are specified in @xmath0 it is a simple matter to determine the relative distance corresponding to any edge of @xmath1 .",
    "the framework @xmath0 therefore represents both a system of polynomial equations and a particular solution to these equations .",
    "we will call these equations the framework equations - they correspond to the dimensional constraint equations referred to above . in general",
    "the framework vector @xmath2 will be just one of the many possible solutions to the framework equations .",
    "( estimates on the number of solutions have been obtained by several authors , see for example @xcite . )",
    "efficient algorithms for solving the framework equations are extremely useful .",
    "a particularly desirable case is when there are only a finite number of solutions , and these solutions can be expressed as a sequence of square , or higher power , roots of combinations of the squared edge distances .",
    "such frameworks are said to be quadratically solvable ( or ruler - and - compass - constructible @xcite ) and radically solvable , respectively .",
    "we will consider the problem of determining which generic frameworks are quadratically or radically solvable .",
    "the condition that the framework equations should have only finitely many solutions is equivalent to the statement that the framework is rigid .",
    "this property has been extensively studied and we refer the reader to @xcite for an excellent survey of the area .",
    "previous work on quadratic / radical solvability @xcite considered generic frameworks which are minimally rigid i.e. cease to be rigid when any edge is removed .",
    "a conjectured characterisation of quadratically / radically solvable minimally rigid generic frameworks was given in @xcite and this conjecture was verified for the special case when the underlying graph is 3-connected and planar in @xcite .",
    "we will extend the study of quadratic and radical solvability to include generic frameworks which are rigid but not necessarily minimally rigid .",
    "we first show in lemma [ radgen ] that the quadratic or radical solvability of a generic framework depends only on the underlying graph .",
    "this means that if a graph is quadratically or radically solvable then there will be a quadratic or radical solution to the corresponding system of framework equations for any sufficiently general but consistent set of input distances .",
    "we next consider globally rigid graphs i.e. graphs for which every generic realisation is a unique solution to the corresponding framework equations .",
    "we show in theorem [ globallyrigid ] that all such graphs are quadratically solvable .",
    "we develop a reduction scheme in section [ 3con ] which shows how the radical or quadratic solvability of a rigid graph is related to the corresponding property for a derived graph which may be chosen to be minimally rigid .",
    "we use this and the main result of @xcite to show in theorem [ planar ] that a rigid 3-connected planar graph is radically solvable if and only if it is globally rigid .",
    "this leads us to consider rigid graphs which are not 3-connected i.e. graphs @xmath3 which can be separated into two subgraphs @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "we show in theorem [ 2sep ] that the radical or quadratic solvability of @xmath1 is determined by the corresponding property of @xmath6 and @xmath7 when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both rigid , and of @xmath6 and @xmath9 when @xmath8 is not rigid and @xmath9 is minimally rigid .",
    "we use this analysis to give a constructive definition for a family of quadratically solvable graphs @xmath10 .",
    "we conjecture that every radically solvable graph belongs to @xmath10 and prove in theorem [ planar2con ] that this holds for planar graphs .",
