    "the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in a optical lattice has attracted much attention of both theorists and experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting problems in this system is the breakdown of the superfluidity . in a recent experiment ,",
    "the stability of becs in a moving 1d optical lattice has been investigated , it has been demonstrated that the landau and dynamical instabilities destabilize the system when the velocity of the lattice exceeds certain critical values  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in a number of theoretical works , the stability of becs in an optical lattice have been studied in great detail  @xcite .    in the present paper , by means of the kronig - penney ( kp ) model , we study the elementary excitations and the stability of becs with supercurrent in a 1d periodic potential . in our previous work , the excitation spectrum of current - free becs in a kronig - penney potential has been calculated by applying the bloch theorem to the solution of bogoliubov equations for a single - barrier problem  @xcite .",
    "we will extend this theory to the case of a current - carrying becs .",
    "we consider a quasi-1d bec at the absolute zero of temperature in a kronig - penney potential , which is a periodic array of @xmath0-function potential barriers , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lattice constant , and @xmath3 is the potential strength .",
    "we consider that the condensate has supercurrent flowing through the periodic potential , which corresponds to the situation where the optical lattice created by two counter - propagating laser beams with frequency difference is moving at a constant velocity  @xcite .",
    "our formulation of the problem is based on the mean field theory , which consists of the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation and the bogoliubov equations  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the condensate is weakly perturbed and seeking the solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation in the form @xmath4 , one obtains them , @xmath5\\psi_0(x ) = 0,\\label{eq : sgpe }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chemical potential and @xmath8 is the coupling constant of the interparticle interaction .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath9 tells us the stability of a bec .",
    "the appearance of the negative excitation energy is a signature of the landau instability , while the appearance of the complex excitation energy is that of the dynamical instability .    , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the number of condensate atoms . , height=3 ]    at first",
    ", we shall solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgpe ] ) .",
    "we assume that the condensate stands in the first condensate band .",
    "then , assuming that the lattice constant @xmath2 is much larger than the healing length @xmath14 , one can approximately obtain the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgpe ] ) as @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined by the boundary conditions at @xmath21 .    imposing the bloch theorem @xmath22 on the condensate wave function ( [ eq : con ] )",
    ", we can calculate the first condensate band @xmath23 , the group velocity @xmath24 and the effective mass @xmath25 as functions of the condensate quasimomentum @xmath26 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "the swallowtail structure in the first condensate band exists around the edge of the first brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all](a ) ) , which disappears when the potential strength is sufficiently large compared to the mean field energy  @xcite .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the upper side of the swallowtail is dynamically unstable  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the system is expected to be stable for the long wavelength phonon in the upper side , because the effective mass is positive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all](c ) )",
    ". we will confirm these two fact , namely the dynamical instability and the existence of the stable phonons in the upper side .",
    "next , we analytically calculate the excitation spectrum . we shall first find solutions of the bogoliubov equations ( [ eq : bdge ] ) in the region @xmath27 where only a single barrier exists .",
    "there exists two independent solutions with the excitation energy @xmath9 of the single barrier problem , corresponding to two types of scattering process .",
    "one is the process in which an excitation comes from the left ( @xmath28 ) , and the other from the right ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath28 is written as  @xcite @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the amplitudes of the reflected , the left localized , the transmitted , and the right localized components , respectively .",
    "all the coefficients can be determined by the boundary conditions at @xmath35 .",
    "once the coefficients of @xmath28 is obtained , the coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 of @xmath29 can be easily obtained as well  @xcite .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath40 strongly depends on the supercurrent as follows .",
    "if there is no supercurrent , the transmission coefficient has a kind of resonant behavior with a peak at @xmath41 , which is called _ anomalous tunneling _  @xcite .",
    "as the supercurrent increases , the width of the peak becomes narrow ; consequently , the anomalous tunneling disappears at a certain critical value of the supercurrent  @xcite .",
    "we can write a general solution of the bogoliubov equations ( [ eq : bdge ] ) in @xmath27 as a linear combination of @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary constants . extending this solution to all regions of @xmath45 by means of the bloch theorem ,",
    "one can obtain the relation between the energy @xmath9 and the quasimomentum @xmath46 of the excitation : @xmath47    + ( t^{\\rm l}t^{\\rm r}-r^{\\rm l}r^{\\rm r } )    { \\rm exp}\\left[{\\rm i}\\frac{(k_1-k_2)a}{2\\hbar}\\right]=    \\nonumber\\\\    t^{\\rm l}{\\rm exp}\\left[{\\rm i }    \\frac{(-2q+k_1+k_2)a}{2\\hbar}\\right ]    + t^{\\rm r}{\\rm exp}\\left[{\\rm i }    \\frac{(2q - k_1-k_2)a}{2\\hbar}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : rel_eq }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 satisfies the bogoliubov excitation spectrum in a uniform system  @xcite , @xmath49 as well as the case of a current - free condensate , we clearly see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_eq ] ) that the tunneling properties in the single barrier problem determine the band structure of the excitation spectrum .",
    "( a ) stability phase diagram of the condensate in a kp potential , where @xmath50 . the light shaded area and the dark shaded area correspond to the regions of the landau instability and the dynamical instability , respectively .",
    "this figure is focused to a region close to the swallowtail .",
    "( b ) second band of the excitation spectrum .",
    ", height=151 ]    now let us discuss the stability of condensates in a kp potential .",
    "we note in advance that there are three important values of the condensate quasimomentum , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath51 corresponds to the point where the anomalous tunneling disappears , @xmath52 to the point where the group velocity reaches its maximum value and the sign of the effective mass changes , and @xmath53 to the edge of the swallowtail , respectively .    calculating the excitation spectrum by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel_eq ] ) , we obtain the stability phase diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability](a ) .",
    "the light ( dark ) shaded area corresponds to the region of the landau ( dynamical ) instability where the negative - energy ( complex - energy ) excitation exists .",
    "both of the instabilities appear in the first band of the excitation spectrum . in the lower side of the swallowtail , @xmath54 is the onset of the landau instability around @xmath55 and the dynamical instability around @xmath56 , while @xmath57 is the onset of the dynamical instability around @xmath55 . in the upper side , the system is always dynamically unstable , which agree with the result of several recent works . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability](b ) , there also exists the gapless and linear dispersion in the upper portion , reflecting the positive effective mass . as @xmath26 in the lower portion of the swallowtail",
    "approaches @xmath53 , the bottom of the second band of the excitation spectrum approaches the origin .",
    "when @xmath26 reaches @xmath53 , the second band turns into a gapless dispersion . consequently , there exists the gapless and linear dispersion in the upper portion , reflecting the positive effective mass , even though the system is dynamically unstable due to the first bogoliubov band .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the excitation spectrum and the stability of becs in a kp potential .",
    "we have found that the onset of the landau instability coincides with the point where the anomalous tunneling disappears , while all the excitations in the first band of the excitation spectrum exhibits the dynamical instability when the effective mass is negative .",
    "it has been shown that the second band of the excitation spectrum takes the gapless and linear form for the long - wavelength excitations in the upper side of the swallowtail , while the system is always dynamically unstable .",
