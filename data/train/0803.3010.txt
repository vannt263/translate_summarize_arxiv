    "a diagram for @xmath0 ( e.g. figure [ ct ] ) is analogical to the diagram which was introduced in @xcite , while in our case , most of generators are presented by a couple of edges , and only specific generators are presented by a single edge .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce a much more convenient presentation of @xmath0 by reduced diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are signed graphs ( see @xcite ) , where the edges of the graph are signed either by @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "signed graphs are subject to a relation of the form @xmath37 for every cycle with odd number of sign @xmath36 ( similarly to @xcite , which we call anti - cycle .",
    "note that this type of relations appears in @xcite , but in a dual form , where the generators are vertices and not edges . due to this additional relation which arises from an anti - cycle , there are signed graphs @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is a generalized coxeter group ( coxeter group with additional relations , which arise from negatively signed cycles , or anti - cycles ) .",
