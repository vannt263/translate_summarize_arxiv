    "it is widely believed that the currently observed large - scale structure of the universe ( the clusters and superclusters of galaxies ) grew gravitationally out of small density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the imprint of this density variation in early universe was left on the cosmic microwave background radiation in the form of spatial temperature fluctuations .",
    "the gravitational origin , however , can be only a part of the story ; the gravity can enhance , but it can not produce these fluctuations . the quest for the physical process(es ) which produced the initial matter - density fluctuations , has led to the emergence of the following two leading mechanisms : inflation , and topological defects @xcite . of these",
    "the former is , perhaps , the most thoroughly investigated . according to this mechanism there exists , in the evolution of the universe , an early inflationary period",
    "in which the universe expands so rapidly ( exponentially ) that quantum fluctuations get trapped in the expansion . by the end of the inflation , therefore , small irregularities covering a wide range of length - scales permeate the entire universe . gravitational instability then acts on these small initial irregularities and enhances the concentration of matter from which galaxies and clusters of galaxies eventually emerge @xcite .",
    "theory of such processes is , by no means , complete and much needs to be done to determine whether tiny quantum fluctuations can provide a strong enough template for gravitational condensation to finally create the structures that we observe today .",
    "cosmologist , usually , rely on the speculated existence of non - baryonic dark matter to augment the gravitational force to aid and accelerate the structure formation .",
    "the question is far from settled !",
    "it is natural , then , to look elsewhere for the source of the seed density `` fluctuations . ''",
    "an obvious possibility is to explore if electromagnetic interactions taking place in a plasma ( known to be the source of a whole variety of linear as well as nonlinear waves ) can cause the required density perturbations . in the standard cosmological model of the hot universe ( the big bang model )",
    ", it is estimated that temperatures as high as @xmath0 prevail up to times @xmath1 1 second ( @xmath2 ) after the big bang . in this epoch ,",
    "the main constituents of the universe are photons , neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , and e - p pairs @xcite .",
    "as the plasma cools down the annihilation process @xmath3 dominates and the @xmath4 pair concentration goes down . since the equilibration rates are fast in comparison with the changes in plasma parameters , an equilibrium e - p plasma should be present in the mev epoch of the early universe .",
    "it is this plasma - dominated era in which we will seek the seeds for future structure formation .",
    "relativistic e - p plasmas have been investigated quite extensively @xcite .",
    "tajima and taniuti  @xcite suggested that collective processes in these plasmas could lead to interesting consequences for structure formation . in the e - p plasma of the early universe ,",
    "localized low frequency electromagnetic ( em ) waves ( @xmath5 ) could propagate as an envelope soliton due to the interaction with sound waves .",
    "plasma density variations related to these solitons could potentially be useful towards structure formation in the universe .",
    "however the analysis @xcite is based on a one dimensional formulation , and the corresponding soliton solutions are likely to be unstable in higher dimensions .",
    "berezhiani and mahajan  @xcite argued that in the mev epoch of the universe , although the e - p pairs form the dominant constituent of the plasma , a minority population of heavy ions is also present due to the baryon asymmetry . they were able to show that , under appropriate conditions ( when the plasma is transparent , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the pulse ( plasma ) frequency ) , the resulting e - p - ion plasma supports the propagation of stable , nondiffracting and nondispersing em pulses ( light bullets ) with large density bunching .",
    "it was further shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that these bullets are exceptionally robust : they can emerge from a large variety of initial field distributions , and are remarkably stable .",
    "note that the characteristic dimensions of such matter - filled light pulses are proportional to the electron to ion density ratio , and tend to be considerably larger than the skin depth ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the implication is that when one deals with the em structures whose characteristic dimensions ( of the spatio - temporal inhomogeneities ) are of the order of the skin depth , the baryon asymmetry affects can be safely neglected , and the dynamical system can be assumed as a pure electron - positron plasma .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the propagation of strong em radiation in a hot pure e - p plasma with the explicit aim of finding soliton - type solutions .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be transparent .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamics of the em field envelope is governed by a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) with a defocusing nonlinearity . in 1d , this equation admits dark soliton solutions , while in 2d , the so called vortex soliton solutions are also possible .",
    "dark solitons exist as dips on a continuous - wave background field .",
    "being stable in one dimensional , they appear as dark - stripe solitary waves in bulk medium .",
    "however , such stripes are unstable to transverse modulations that results in the induced generation of vortices with alternating polarities .",
    "vortex solitons , which are the most fundamental 2d soliton solutions of nse with an angular @xmath10 phase ramp , appear as local dark minima in an otherwise bright background .",
    "vortex solitons have been recently observed in materials with a defocusing optical nonlinearity  the dynamics of laser beams in these materials is generally described by the nse @xcite . since the electromagnetic vortices ( emv ) carry angular momentum that is conserved during propagation",
    ", the generation of vortex solitons in an e - p plasma is a potent mechanism for creating domains with definite angular momenta even out of an initial field distribution devoid of angular momentum . to keep the total angular momentum zero",

    "this should pose no problem because the ambient uniform field background could easily foot the bill .",
    "the next scale length on which we encounter `` bullet - like '' electromagnetic structures ( which owe their origin to the baryon asymmetry ) is considerably larger than the skin depth .",

    "<S> it is shown that the interaction of large amplitude electromagnetic waves with a hot electron - positron ( e - p ) plasma ( a principal constituent of the universe in the mev epoch ) leads to a bunching of mass , energy , and angular momentum in stable , long - lived structures . </S>",
    "<S> electromagnetism in the mev epoch , then , could provide a possible route for seeding the observed large - scale structure of the universe . </S>"
