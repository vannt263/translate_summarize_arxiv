    "quantifying correlations between different stocks is a topic of interest not only for scientific reasons of understanding the economy as a complex dynamical system , but also for practical reasons such as asset allocation and portfolio - risk estimation  @xcite . unlike most physical systems , where one relates correlations between subunits to basic interactions , the underlying `` interactions '' for the stock market problem are not known . here ,",
    "we analyze cross - correlations between stocks by applying concepts and methods of random matrix theory , developed in the context of complex quantum systems where the precise nature of the interactions between subunits are not known .    in order to quantify correlations",
    ", we first calculate the price change ( `` return '' ) of stock @xmath2 over a time scale @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the price of stock @xmath6 . since different stocks have varying levels of volatility ( standard deviation ) , we define a normalized return @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the standard deviation of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes a time average over the period studied .",
    "we then compute the equal - time cross - correlation matrix * c * with elements @xmath11 by construction , the elements @xmath12 are restricted to the domain @xmath13 , where @xmath14 corresponds to perfect correlations , @xmath15 corresponds to perfect anti - correlations , and @xmath16 corresponds to uncorrelated pairs of stocks .",
    "the difficulties in analyzing the significance and meaning of the empirical cross - correlation coefficients @xmath12 are due to several reasons , which include the following :    \\(i ) market conditions change with time and the cross - correlations that exist between any pair of stocks may not be stationary .",
    "\\(ii ) the finite length of time series available to estimate cross - correlations introduces `` measurement noise '' .",
    "if we use a long time series to circumvent the problem of finite length , our estimates will be affected by the non - stationarity of cross - correlations . for these reasons",
    ", the empirically - measured cross - correlations will contain `` random '' contributions , and it is a difficult problem in general to estimate from * c * the cross - correlations that are not a result of randomness .",
    "how can we identify from @xmath12 , those stocks that remained correlated ( on the average ) in the time period studied ? to answer this question ,",
    "we test the statistics of * c * against the `` null hypothesis '' of a random correlation matrix  a correlation matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time series .",
    "if the properties of * c * conform to those of a random correlation matrix , then it follows that the contents of the empirically - measured * c * are random .",
    "conversely , deviations of the properties of * c * from those of a random correlation matrix convey information about `` genuine '' correlations .",
    "thus , our goal shall be to compare the properties of * c * with those of a random correlation matrix and separate the content of * c * into two groups : ( a ) the part of * c * that conforms to the properties of random correlation matrices ( `` noise '' ) and ( b ) the part of * c * that deviates ( `` information '' ) .",
    "the study of statistical properties of matrices with independent random elements  _ random matrices _  has a rich history originating in nuclear physics  @xcite . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the problem of interest 50  years ago was to understand the energy levels of complex nuclei , which the existing models failed to explain .",
    "rmt was developed in this context by wigner , dyson , mehta , and others in order to explain the statistics of energy levels of complex quantum systems .",
    "they postulated that the hamiltonian describing a heavy nucleus can be described by a matrix * h * with independent random elements @xmath17 drawn from a probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "based on this assumption , a series of remarkable predictions were made which are found to be in agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "for complex quantum systems , rmt predictions represent an average over all possible interactions  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the _ universal _ predictions of rmt identify system - specific , non - random properties of the system under consideration , providing clues about the underlying interactions @xcite .    recent studies  @xcite applying rmt methods to analyze the properties of * c * show that @xmath18% of the eigenvalues of * c * agree with rmt predictions , suggesting a considerable degree of randomness in the measured cross - correlations .",
    "it is also found that there are deviations from rmt predictions for @xmath19% of the largest eigenvalues .",
    "these results prompt the following questions :    * what is a possible interpretation for the deviations from rmt ? *",
    "are the deviations from rmt stable in time ? * what can we infer about the structure of * c * from these results ? * what are the practical implications of these results ?    in the following , we address these questions in detail .",
    "we find that the largest eigenvalue of * c * represents the influence of the entire market that is common to all stocks .",
    "our analysis of the contents of the remaining eigenvalues that deviate from rmt shows the existence of cross - correlations between stocks of the same type of industry , stocks having large market capitalization , and stocks of firms having business in certain geographical areas  @xcite . by calculating the scalar product of the eigenvectors from one time period to the next , we find that the `` deviating eigenvectors '' have varying degrees of time stability , quantified by the magnitude of the scalar product .",
    "the largest 2 - 3 eigenvectors are stable for extended periods of time , while for the rest of the deviating eigenvectors , the time stability decreases as the the corresponding eigenvalues are closer to the rmt upper bound .",
    "to test that the deviating eigenvalues are the only `` genuine '' information contained in * c * , we compare the eigenvalue statistics of * c * with the known universal properties of real symmetric random matrices , and we find good agreement with the rmt results . using the notion of the inverse participation ratio , we analyze the eigenvectors of * c * and find large values of inverse participation ratio at both edges of the eigenvalue spectrum  suggesting a `` random band '' matrix structure for * c*.",
    "lastly , we discuss applications to the practical goal of finding an investment that provides a given return without exposure to unnecessary risk . in addition , it is possible that our methods can also be applied for filtering out ` noise ' in empirically - measured cross - correlation matrices in a wide variety of applications .",

    "section iii discusses the statistics of cross - correlation coefficients .",
    "section iv discusses the eigenvalue distribution of * c * and compares with rmt results .",

    "figure  [ distcij](a ) shows that @xmath32 is consistent with a gaussian with zero mean , in contrast to @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we see that the part of @xmath26 for @xmath33 ( which corresponds to anti - correlations ) is within the gaussian curve for the control , suggesting the possibility that the observed negative cross - correlations in * c * may be an effect of randomness .",
    "figure  [ distcij](b ) shows @xmath26 for daily returns from the crsp database for five non - overlapping 7-yr sub - periods in the 35-yr period 196296 .",
    "we see that the time dependence of @xmath30 is more pronounced in this plot . in particular , the period containing the market crash of october 19 , 1987 has the largest average value @xmath29 , suggesting the existence of cross - correlations that are more pronounced in volatile periods than in calm periods .",
    "we test this possibility by comparing @xmath30 with the average volatility of the market ( measured using the s&p 500 index ) , which shows large values of @xmath29 during periods of large volatility [ fig .",

    "as stated above , our aim is to extract information about cross - correlations from * c*. so , we compare the properties of * c * with those of a random cross - correlation matrix  @xcite . in matrix notation , the correlation matrix can be expressed as @xmath34 where * g * is an @xmath35 matrix with elements @xmath36 , and * g@xmath37 * denotes the transpose of * g*. therefore , we consider a `` random '' correlation matrix @xmath38 where * a * is an @xmath35 matrix containing @xmath39 time series of @xmath40 random elements with zero mean and unit variance , that are mutually uncorrelated . by construction * r * belongs to the type of matrices often referred to as wishart matrices in multivariate statistics  @xcite .",

    "thus , a comparison of @xmath50 with the rmt result @xmath43 allows us to distinguish the _ bulk _ of the eigenvalue spectrum of * c * that agrees with rmt ( random correlations ) from the deviations ( genuine correlations ) .",
    "the presence of a well - defined bulk of eigenvalues that agree with @xmath51 suggests that the contents of * c * are mostly random except for the eigenvalues that deviate .",
    "our conclusion was based on the comparison of the eigenvalue distribution @xmath50 of * c * with that of random matrices of the type * r = @xmath67 a a@xmath68*. quite generally , comparison of the eigenvalue distribution with @xmath51 alone is not sufficient to support the possibility that the bulk of the eigenvalue spectrum of * c * is random .",
    "random matrices that have drastically different @xmath50 share similar correlation structures in their eigenvalues  universal properties  that depend only on the general symmetries of the matrix  @xcite .",
    "conversely , matrices that have the same eigenvalue distribution can have drastically different eigenvalue correlations .",
    "therefore , a test of randomness of * c * involves the investigation of correlations in the eigenvalues @xmath0 .",
    "since by definition * c * is a real symmetric matrix , we shall test the eigenvalue statistics * c * for universal features of eigenvalue correlations displayed by real symmetric random matrices . consider a @xmath69 real symmetric random matrix * s * with off - diagonal elements @xmath70 , which for @xmath71 are independent and identically distributed with zero mean @xmath72 and variance @xmath73 .",
    "it is conjectured based on analytical  @xcite and extensive numerical evidence  @xcite that in the limit @xmath74 , regardless of the distribution of elements @xmath70 , this class of matrices , on the scale of local mean eigenvalue spacing , display the universal properties ( eigenvalue correlation functions ) of the ensemble of matrices whose elements are distributed according to a gaussian probability measure  called the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite .",
    "formally , goe is defined on the space of real symmetric matrices by two requirements  @xcite .",
    "the first is that the ensemble is invariant under orthogonal transformations , i.e. , for any goe matrix * z * , the transformation * z*@xmath75z@xmath76*w@xmath37 z w * , where * w * is any real orthogonal matrix ( * w w@xmath37=i * ) , leaves the joint probability @xmath77 of elements @xmath78 unchanged : @xmath79 .",
    "the second requirement is that the elements @xmath80 are statistically independent  @xcite .    by definition ,",
    "random cross - correlation matrices * r * ( eq .  ( [ matrixa ] ) ) that we are interested in are not strictly goe - type matrices , but",
    "rather belong to a special ensemble called the `` chiral '' goe  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by the following argument .",
    "define a matrix * b * @xmath81 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues @xmath82 of * b * are given by @xmath83 and similarly , the eigenvalues @xmath44 of * r * are given by @xmath84 .",
    "thus , all non - zero eigenvalues of * b * occur in pairs , i.e. , for every eigenvalue @xmath44 of * r * , @xmath85 are eigenvalues of * b*. since the eigenvalues occur pairwise , the eigenvalue spectra of both * b * and * r * have special properties in the neighborhood of zero that are different from the standard goe  @xcite . as these special properties decay rapidly as one goes further from zero , the eigenvalue correlations of * r * in the bulk of the spectrum are still consistent with those of the standard goe .",
    "therefore , our goal shall be to test the bulk of the eigenvalue spectrum of the empirically - measured cross - correlation matrix * c * with the known universal features of standard goe - type matrices .    in the following , we test the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of * c * for three known universal properties  @xcite displayed by goe matrices : ( i ) the distribution of nearest - neighbor eigenvalue spacings @xmath86 , ( ii ) the distribution of next - nearest - neighbor eigenvalue spacings @xmath87 , and ( iii ) the `` number variance '' statistic @xmath88 .",
    "the analytical results for the three properties listed above hold if the spacings between adjacent eigenvalues ( rank - ordered ) are expressed in units of _ average _ eigenvalue spacing . quite generally , the average eigenvalue spacing changes from one part of the eigenvalue spectrum to the next .",
    "so , in order to ensure that the eigenvalue spacing has a uniform _ average _ value throughout the spectrum , we must find a transformation called `` unfolding , '' which maps the eigenvalues @xmath0 to new variables called `` unfolded eigenvalues '' @xmath89 , whose distribution is uniform  @xcite .",
    "unfolding ensures that the distances between eigenvalues are expressed in units of local mean eigenvalue spacing  @xcite , and thus facilitates comparison with theoretical results .",
    "the procedures that we use for unfolding the eigenvalue spectrum are discussed in appendix a.      we first consider the eigenvalue spacing distribution , which reflects two - point as well as eigenvalue correlation functions of all orders .",
    "we compare the eigenvalue spacing distribution of * c * with that of goe random matrices . for goe matrices ,",
    "the distribution of `` nearest - neighbor '' eigenvalue spacings @xmath90 is given by  @xcite @xmath91 often referred to as the `` wigner surmise ''  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian decay of @xmath92 for large @xmath93 [ bold curve in fig .",
    "[ spacdist](a ) ] implies that @xmath92 `` probes '' scales only of the order of one eigenvalue spacing .",
    "thus , the spacing distribution is known to be robust across different unfolding procedures  @xcite .",
    "we first calculate the distribution of the `` nearest - neighbor spacings '' @xmath94 of the unfolded eigenvalues obtained using the gaussian broadening procedure .",
    "figure  [ spacdist](a ) shows that the distribution @xmath95 of nearest - neighbor eigenvalue spacings for * c * constructed from 30-min returns for the 2-yr period 199495 agrees well with the rmt result @xmath92 for goe matrices .",
    "identical results are obtained when we use the alternative unfolding procedure of fitting the eigenvalue distribution .",
    "in addition , we test the agreement of @xmath95 with rmt results by fitting @xmath96 to the one - parameter brody distribution  @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98^{1+\\beta}$ ] .",
    "the case @xmath99 corresponds to the goe and @xmath100 corresponds to uncorrelated eigenvalues ( poisson - distributed spacings ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath101 , in good agreement with the goe prediction @xmath99 . to test non - parametrically that @xmath92 is the correct description for @xmath95",
    ", we perform the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "we find that at the 60@xmath102 confidence level , a kolmogorov - smirnov test can not reject the hypothesis that the goe is the correct description for @xmath95 .",
    "next , we analyze the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath96 for * c * constructed from daily returns for four 7-yr periods [ fig .  [ spacdist - daily ] ] .",

    "<S> we test the statistics of the eigenvalues @xmath0 of * c * against a `` null hypothesis ''  a random correlation matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time series . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a majority of the eigenvalues of * c * fall within the rmt bounds @xmath1 $ ] for the eigenvalues of random correlation matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we test the eigenvalues of * c * within the rmt bound for universal properties of random matrices and find good agreement with the results for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices  implying a large degree of randomness in the measured cross - correlation coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that the distribution of eigenvector components for the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues outside the rmt bound display systematic deviations from the rmt prediction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that these `` deviating eigenvectors '' are stable in time . we analyze the components of the deviating eigenvectors and find that the largest eigenvalue corresponds to an influence common to all stocks . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the remaining deviating eigenvectors shows distinct groups , whose identities correspond to conventionally - identified business sectors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss applications to the construction of portfolios of stocks that have a stable ratio of risk to return .    2 </S>"
