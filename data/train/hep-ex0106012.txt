    "as the world s highest  energy accelerator , the tevatron collider provides a unique opportunity to search for evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are many possible additions to the standard model , such as extra spatial dimensions , additional quark generations , additional gauge bosons , quark and lepton substructure , weak  scale gravitational effects , new strong forces , and/or supersymmetry , which may be accessible at the tev mass scale .",
    "in addition , the source of electro - weak symmetry breaking , also below this mass scale , could well be more complicated than the standard model higgs mechanism .",
    "new physics processes are expected to involve the production of heavy particles , which can decay into standard model constituents ( quarks , gluons , and electroweak bosons ) which in turn decay to hadrons and leptons . due to the large mass of the new parent particles ,",
    "the decay products will be observed with large momentum transverse to the beam ( @xmath10 ) , where the rate for standard model particle production is suppressed .",
    "in addition , in many models these hypothetical particles have large branching ratios into photons , leptons , heavy quarks or neutral non - interacting particles , which are relatively rare at large values of @xmath10 in ordinary proton - antiproton collisions .    in this paper",
    "we present a broad search for phenomena beyond those expected in the standard model by measuring the production rate of events containing at least one gauge boson , in this case the photon , and a third - generation quark , the b - quark , both with and without additional characteristics such as missing transverse energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "accompanying searches are made within these samples for anomalous production of jets , leptons , and additional b - quarks , which are predicted in models of new physics .",
    "in addition , the signature of one gauge - boson plus a third - generation quark is rare in the standard model , and thus provides an excellent channel in which to search for new production mechanisms .",
    "the initial motivation of this analysis was a search for the stop squark ( @xmath12 ) stemming from the unusual @xmath13 event observed at the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf)@xcite . a model was proposed@xcite that produces the photon from the radiative decay of the @xmath14 neutralino , selected to be the photino , into the @xmath15 , selected to be the orthogonal state of purely higgsino , and a photon .",
    "the production of a chargino - neutralino pair , @xmath16 , could produce the @xmath17 final state via the decay chain    @xmath18    this model , however , represents only a small part of the available parameter space for models of new physics .",
    "technicolor models , supersymmetric models in which supersymmetry is broken by gauge interactions , models of new heavy quarks , and models of compositness predicting an excited @xmath0 quark which decays to @xmath5 , for example , would also create this signature .",
    "we have consequently generalized the search , emphasizing the signature ( @xmath19 or @xmath17 ) rather than this specific model .",
    "we present generalized , model  independent limits .",
    "ideally , these generic limits could be applied to actual models of new physics to provide the information on whether models are excluded or allowed by the data .",
    "other procedures for signature  based limits have been presented recently@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we begin with a description of the data selection followed by a description of the calculation of backgrounds and observations of the data .",
    "next we present rigorously  derived limits on both minimal supersymmetric ( mssm ) and gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models .",
    "the next sections present the model  independent limits .",
    "finally , in the appendix we present tests of the application of model  independent limits to a variety of models that generate this signature .",
    "a search for the heavy techniomega , @xmath20 , in the final state @xmath21 , derived from the same data sample , has already been published@xcite .",
    "the data used here correspond to 85 pb@xmath1 of @xmath22 collisions at @xmath23 tev . the data sample was collected by triggering on the electromagnetic cluster caused by the photon in the central calorimeter .",
    "we use ` standard ' photon identification cuts developed for previous photon analyses  @xcite , which are similar to standard electron requirements except that there is a restriction on any tracks near the cluster .",
    "the events are required to have at least one jet with a secondary vertex found by the standard silicon detector @xmath0quark identification algorithm . finally , we apply missing transverse energy requirements and other selections to examine subsamples .",
    "we discuss the selection in detail below .",
    "we briefly describe the relevant aspects of the cdf detector  @xcite .",
    "a superconducting solenoidal magnet provides a 1.4  t magnetic field in a volume 3  m in diameter and 5  m long , containing three tracking devices .",
    "closest to the beamline is a 4-layer silicon microstrip detector ( svx )  @xcite used to identify the secondary vertices from @xmath0hadron decays .",
    "a track reconstructed in the svx has an impact parameter resolution of 19@xmath3 m at high momentum to approximately 25@xmath3 m at 2  gev / c of track momentum . outside the svx , a time projection chamber ( vtx )",
    "locates the @xmath24 position of the interaction . in the region with radius from 30  cm to 132  cm , the central tracking chamber ( ctc ) measures charged  particle momenta . surrounding the magnet coil",
    "is the electromagnetic calorimeter , which is in turn surrounded by the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "these calorimeters are constructed of towers , subtending @xmath25 in @xmath26 and 0.1 in @xmath27@xcite , pointing to the interaction region . the central preradiator wire chamber ( cpr )",
    "is located on the inner face of the calorimeter in the central region ( ) . this device is used to determine if the origin of an electromagnetic shower from a photon was in the magnet coil . at a depth of six radiation lengths into the electromagnetic calorimeter ( and 184 cm from the beamline ) , wire chambers with additional cathode strip readout ( central electromagnetic strip chambers , ces ) measure two orthogonal profiles of showers . for convenience",
    "we report all energies in gev , all momenta as momentum times @xmath28 in gev , and all masses as mass times @xmath29 in gev .",
    "transverse energy ( @xmath30 ) is the energy deposited in the calorimeter multiplied by @xmath31 .",
    "collisions that produce a photon candidate are selected by at least one of a pair of three - level triggers , each of which requires a central electromagnetic cluster .",
    "the dominant high@xmath30 photon trigger requires a 23  gev cluster with less than approximately 5  gev additional energy in the region of the calorimeter surrounding the cluster  @xcite .",
    "a second trigger , designed to have high efficiency at large values of @xmath30 , requires a 50  gev cluster , but has no requirement on the isolation energy .",
    "these events are required to have no energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter outside of the time window that corresponds to the beam crossing .",
    "this rejects events where the electromagnetic cluster was caused by a cosmic ray muon which scatters and emits bremsstrahlung in the calorimeter .",
    "primary vertices for the @xmath2 collisions are reconstructed in the vtx system .",
    "a primary vertex is selected as the one with the largest total @xmath32 attached to it , followed by adding silicon tracks for greater precision .",
    "this vertex is required to be less than 60  cm from the center of the detector along the beamline , so that the jet is well - contained and the projective nature of the calorimeters is preserved .      to purify the photon sample in the offline analysis , we select events with an electromagnetic cluster with @xmath3325  gev and @xmath34 . to provide for a reliable energy measurement we require the cluster to be away from cracks in the calorimeter . to remove backgrounds from jets and electrons",
    ", we require the electromagnetic cluster to be isolated .",
    "specifically , we require that the shower shape in the ces chambers at shower maximum be consistent with that of a single photon , that there are no other clusters nearby in the ces , and that there is little energy in the hadronic calorimeter towers associated with ( _ i.e. _ directly behind ) the electromagnetic towers of the cluster .",
    "we allow no tracks with @xmath35  gev to point at the cluster , and at most one track with @xmath36  gev .",
    "we require that the sum of the @xmath10 of all tracks within a cone of @xmath37 around the cluster be less than 5 gev .",
    "if the photon cluster has @xmath38  50  gev , we require the energy in a @xmath39 array of trigger towers ( trigger towers are made of two consecutive physical towers in @xmath27 ) to be less than 4  gev .",
    "this isolation energy sum excludes the energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter trigger tower with the largest energy .",
    "this requirement is more restrictive than the hardware trigger isolation requirement , which is approximately 5  gev on the same quantity . in some cases the photon shower leaks into adjacent towers and the leaked photon shower energy",
    "is included in the isolation energy sum .",
    "this effect leads to an approximately 20% inefficiency for this trigger .",
    "when the cluster @xmath30 is above 50  gev , a second trigger with no isolation requirement accepts the event . for these events , we require the transverse energy found in the calorimeter in a cone of @xmath40 around the cluster to be less than 10% of the cluster s energy .",
    "these requirements yield a data sample of 511,335 events in an exposure of 85  @xmath41 of integrated luminosity .",
    "jets in the events are clustered with a cone of 0.4 in @xmath42 space using the standard cdf algorithm@xcite .",
    "one of the jets with @xmath43 is required to be identified as a @xmath0quark jet by the displaced - vertex algorithm used in the top ",
    "quark analysis@xcite .",
    "this algorithm searches for tracks in the svx that are associated with the jet but not associated with the primary vertex , indicating they come from the decay of a long  lived particle .",
    "we require that the track , extrapolated to the interaction vertex , has a distance of closest approach greater than 2.5 times its uncertainty and pass loose requirements on @xmath10 and hit quality .",
    "the tracks passing these cuts are used to search for a vertex with three or more tracks .",
    "if no vertex is found , additional requirements are placed on the tracks , and this new list is used to search for a two  track vertex .",
    "the transverse decay length , @xmath44 , is defined in the transverse plane as the projection of the vector pointing from the primary vertex to the secondary vertex on a unit vector along the jet axis .",
    "we require @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the uncertainty on @xmath44 .",
    "these requirements constitute a `` tag '' . in the data sample the tag is required to be positive , with @xmath47 .",
    "the photon cluster can have tracks accidentally associated with it and could possibly be tagged ; we remove these events .",
    "this selection reduces the dataset to 1487 events .",
    "the jet energies are corrected for calorimeter gaps and non - linear response , energy not contained in the jet cone , and underlying event energy@xcite . for each jet",
    "the resulting corrected @xmath30 is the best estimate of the underlying true quark or gluon transverse energy , and is used for all jet requirements in this analysis .",
    "we require the @xmath30 of the tagged jet in the initial @xmath48 event selection to be greater than 30  gev ; this reduces the data set to 1175 events .",
    "while the photon and @xmath0tagged jet constitute the core of the signature we investigate , supersymmetry and other new physics could be manifested in any number of different signatures . because of the strong dependence of signature on the many parameters in supersymmetry , one signature is ( arguably ) not obviously more likely than any other . for these reasons we search for events with unusual properties such as very large missing @xmath30 or additional reconstructed objects .",
    "these objects may be jets , leptons , additional photons or @xmath0-tags .",
    "this method of sifting events was employed in a previous analysis@xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to objects with large @xmath30 since this process is serving as a sieve of the events for obvious anomalies .",
    "in addition , in the lower @xmath30 regime the backgrounds are larger and more difficult to calculate . in this section",
    "we summarize the requirements that define these objects .",
    "missing @xmath30 ( @xmath11 ) is the magnitude of negative of the two - dimensional vector sum of the measured @xmath30 in each calorimeter tower with energy above a low threshold in the region @xmath49 .",
    "all jets in the event with uncorrected @xmath30 greater than 5  gev and @xmath502 are corrected appropriately for known systematic detector mismeasurements ; these corrections are propagated into the missing @xmath30 .",
    "missing @xmath30 is also corrected using the measured momentum of muons , which do not deposit much of their energy in the calorimeter .",
    "we apply a requirement of 20  gev on missing @xmath30 , and observe that a common topology of the events is a photon opposite in azimuth from the missing @xmath30 ( see figure [ figoptnb ] ) .",
    "we conclude that a common source of missing @xmath30 occurs when the basic event topology is a photon recoiling against a jet .",
    "this topology is likely to be selected by the @xmath11 cut because the fluctuations in the measurement of jet energy favor small jet energy over large . to remove this background",
    ", we remove events in the angular bin @xmath51 for the sample , where we have raised the missing @xmath30 requirement to 40  gev .",
    "we define @xmath52 as the scalar sum of the @xmath30 in the calorimeter added to the missing @xmath30 and the @xmath10 of any muons in the event .",
    "this would serve as a measure of the mass scale of new objects that might be produced .    to be recognized as an additional jet in the event",
    ", a calorimeter cluster must have corrected @xmath3315  gev and @xmath43 . to count as an additional @xmath0 tag",
    ", a jet must be identified as a @xmath0 candidate by the same algorithm as the primary @xmath0 jet , and have @xmath53  gev and @xmath502 . to be counted as an additional photon , an electromagnetic cluster is required to have @xmath54  gev , @xmath34 , and to pass all the same identification requirements as the primary photon .",

    "we search for electrons in the central calorimeter and for muons in the central muon detectors .",
    "candidates for @xmath4 leptons are identified only by their hadronic decays  as a jet with one or three high@xmath10 charged tracks , isolated from other tracks and with calorimeter energy cluster shapes consistent with the @xmath4 hypothesis@xcite .",

    "electrons and muons must have @xmath34 while @xmath4 s must have @xmath61 .",
    "we summarize the kinematic selections in table  [ tab : selection ] .",
    "the backgrounds to the @xmath48 sample are combinations of standard model production of photons and @xmath0 quarks and also jets misidentified as a photon ( `` fake '' photons ) or as a @xmath0quark jet ( `` fake '' tags or mistags ) . a jet may be misidentified as a photon by fragmenting to a hard leading @xmath63 .",
    "other jets may fake a @xmath0quark jet through simple mismeasurement of the tracks leading to a false secondary vertex .",
    "there are several notable effects apparent immediately from table [ tab - object - results ] and figure [ fig - object - results ] .",
    "the first is that the comparison of efficiencies for one model point fares especially poorly .",
    "this occurs when the branching ratio for the model is very small ( 2% ) .",
    "when the events do not contain many real photons and @xmath0 quarks , the small number of objects misidentified as photons and @xmath0-quarks becomes important .",
    "for example , jets may pass photon cuts and @xmath28 quarks may be @xmath0-tagged .",
    "when this occurs , the full simulation will be more efficient than a method which specifically requires that the monte carlo generate an isolated photon or @xmath0-quark in order to accept the event .",
    "this is true of the object efficiencies method and the efficiency model method .",
    "we note that the public monte carlo method does allow misidentification and so it does not show this large mismatch .",
    "we can conclude that when the branching ratios are small , the public monte carlo method is vastly superior to the others .    in the object efficiency method ,",
    "the acceptance of the signature is computed by running the monte carlo without a detector simulation . as each object in the signature is identified and passes acceptance cuts , the individual object efficiencies are multiplied .",
    "these object efficiencies which may or may not be @xmath30 or @xmath27dependent , are listed in section [ section : objeff ] . in this test , these efficiencies are typically well  matched to the rigorously  derived efficiencies .",
    "the average of @xmath64 over all models except the first , is @xmath65 where 0.21 is the rms computed with respect to 1.0 , the ideal result .    in the efficiency model method",
    ", we generate a monte carlo model that is not related to a search for new physics but produces the signature of interest . for the signature of @xmath66",
    ", we generated @xmath67 .",
    "the efficiency model results are also optimistic , the average is a ratio of @xmath68 where again the uncertainty is actually the rms with 1.0 , the ideal result .",
    "we found that the difficulty of applying this method was in choosing the mass scale .",
    "for example , we chose to match the `` @xmath69 '' mass to the @xmath70 mass in the direct production of the @xmath71 model .",
    "however , the photon comes from a secondary decay and the effect of the lsp mass compared to the massless neutrino causes the @xmath30 of the @xmath72 and @xmath0 to be poorly matched to the @xmath30 of these objects in the @xmath73 model .    in the public monte carlo method",
    ", we compute the efficiency using shw , a highly - parameterized , self  contained monte carlo . in general",
    ", results here are somewhat optimistic with the average ratio to the rigorous total efficiency being @xmath74 , where the uncertainty is the rms computed with respect to 1.0 , the ideal result .",
    "the methods for calculating efficiency without access to the full detector simulation are accurate to approximately 30% overall .",
    "they tend to underestimate @xmath76 by 10 - 25% but the result for individual comparisons varies greatly .",
    "these uncertainties are larger than , but not greatly larger than , a typical uncertainty in a rigorously  derived efficiency , which is 20% .",
    "we conclude that to determine if a model is easily excluded or far from being excluded by the data , the model  independent methods are sufficient .",
    "if the model is within 30% of exclusion , no conclusion can be drawn and the efficiency should be rigorously  derived .",
