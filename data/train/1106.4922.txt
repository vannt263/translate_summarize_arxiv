    "this description allows us to derive the correlation functions of the order parameter field without encountering infrared divergences . in the goldstone regime @xmath93 ,",
    "density fluctuations play no role any more and both the transverse and longitudinal correlation functions are fully determined by transverse ( phase ) fluctuations . in this momentum and frequency range , the coupling between transverse and longitudinal fluctuations leads to a divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility and singular self - energies .",
    "nevertheless , in the weak - coupling limit , the bogoliubov theory applies to a large part of the spectrum where the dispersion is linear ( @xmath62 ) and breaks down only at very small momenta @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , thermodynamic quantities are not sensitive to the ginzburg scale @xmath2 and can be deduced from the bogoliubov approach .",
    "a direct computation of the order parameter correlation function ( without relying on the hydrodynamic description ) is possible , but one then has to solve the problem of infrared divergences which appear in perturbation theory when @xmath215 and signal the breakdown of the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "the nprg provides a natural framework for such a calculation .",
    "it shows that in the goldstone regime @xmath93 , the system is described by an effective action with relativistic invariance similar to that of the @xmath207-dimensional classical o(2 ) model .",
    "this similarity sheds light on the critical behavior of the superfluid  mott - insulator transition in the bose - hubbard model which belongs to the @xmath208 universality class when the transition takes place at fixed density ."
