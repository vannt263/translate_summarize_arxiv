    "there is a long history of results showing that galaxy properties vary as a function of environments such as the morphology - density relation in clusters @xcite and its associated star formation rate - density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to show that the anti - correlation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and local projected density holds in clusters up to 2 virial radii from the cluster center . not only is the mean luminosity a function of environment @xcite , but the luminosity function ( lf ) is also a continuous function of the local density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sfr also depends on the local density in groups and in the field .",
    "@xcite showed similar results using the early data release @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and they also showed that the sfr - density relation holds for field galaxies .",
    "@xcite used both the 2dfgrs and the sdss to show that the sfr ( as measured by the  equivalent width ) of field galaxies is strongly dependent on the local projected density .",
    "all these results point to the existence of physical mechanisms that quench star formation as the local density increases , from the field to groups to clusters .    at @xmath14 ,",
    "the quenching of star - formation is apparently already in place . using the wide - field ( @xmath15 ) imager suprimecam at the subaru 8-m telescope , @xcite selected members of the @xmath16 cluster a851 using photometric redshifts and found that the colors of faint galaxies are strongly dependent on the local galaxy density .",
    "follow - up narrow band  imaging of this cluster showed that the fraction of star - forming galaxies is a strong function of the local projected density far ( @xmath171 ) from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "no observations of the sfr - density relation have yet been made at redshifts greater than one .",
    "here , we used ground - based data from the kitt peak 4m telescope fitted with the mosaic wide - field imager to investigate whether or not the sfr - density relation already existed at redshift @xmath13 .",
    "we use photometric redshifts that are accurate to @xmath18 or @xmath19  mpc , comparable in co - moving distance to those of the combo-17 survey .",
    "we present our data and briefly discuss our selection of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in section  [ section : data ] .",
    "we then use mock catalogs from the gif2 collaboration @xcite to show in section  [ section : simulations ] that our photometric redshift accuracy is sufficient to statistically distinguish between low and high density regions .",
    "we estimated the sfr as in section  [ section : sfr ] .",
    "finally , our results are presented in section  [ section : results ] and conclusions in section  [ section : discussion ] .    throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22  km  s@xmath23  mpc@xmath23 . at redshift @xmath24 , @xmath25",
    ", so @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27  mpc in co - moving coordinates .",
    "the observations used here are described in detail in @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bl04 ) .",
    "briefly , we used the wide - field mosaic camera @xcite at the kitt peak national observatory 4 m telescope to image three fields in @xmath1 to a limiting magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "these fields were selected for the presence of a damped  absorber ( dla ) at @xmath28 in our original dla survey ( * ? ? ? * bl04 ) . given the camera s field of view of 36@xmath2936(or @xmath30  mpc on a side ) , our survey covers a total of 0.90 deg@xmath2 .",
    "we selected @xmath313,000 lbgs within the redshift range @xmath32 . from monte carlo simulations , our 50% completeness level is @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , corresponding to @xmath35 , using @xmath36 from @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts were obtained from the algorithm hyperz @xcite coupled with the prior likelihood distribution given by the magnitude @xmath37 of each galaxy ( as in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "see @xcite and bl04 for a detailed description of the tests we performed on the algorithm using spectroscopic redshifts in the hubble deep field - north .",
    "up to @xmath38 , the overall rms @xmath39 is @xmath40@xmath41 , corresponding to @xmath42@xmath3  , and @xmath43 is @xmath44 .    in order",
    "to selected lbgs in a narrow redshift slice , we used the criterion : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the slice redshift , @xmath47 is the redshift slice width , and @xmath48 is the redshift probability distribution ( bl04 ) .",
    "we choose a redshift width of @xmath49 because , as discussed in @xcite , it produces the largest sample in the smallest redshift slice , given the rms of the photo-@xmath50 s . at @xmath51 , there are 68 , 162 , and 104 galaxies in our three fields for a total of 334 .",
    "before investigating the galaxy properties as a function of environment , we used the gif2 numerical simulations of galaxy formation ( described in @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite ) to investigate whether or not , with such a coarse redshift resolution , one can make reliable density estimations based on projected surface densities .",
    "these @xmath52-body simulations were run with 400@xmath53 particles ( each @xmath54 ) over a periodic cube of 110  on a side in a @xmath55 dominated universe . from the output at @xmath13 containing @xmath56 galaxies , we simulated an lbg sample by selecting 975 objects with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the observed @xmath5 magnitude given the absolute magnitude @xmath60 , the redshift of the simulation @xmath13 , and the @xmath61-correction according to the type of spectral energy distribution of the galaxy .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] shows the two - dimensional distribution ( projected along the @xmath50-axis ) of simulated lbgs ( filled triangles ) along with all the galaxies ( points ) in the simulated gif2 volume .",
    "one sees that the simulated lbgs do trace the major over - dense regions and filaments .",
    "importantly , this ` slice ' width corresponds to our redshift resolution , i.e. @xmath62  .",
    "[ fig : compare : n5:n10 ] shows , for the gif2 simulation , the two - dimensional surface density , @xmath7 , versus the three - dimensional true density @xmath63 . both @xmath7 and @xmath63 are computed from the distance to the fifth nearest neighbor .",
    "the horizontal error bars reflect the @xmath64 rms to the mean .",
    "one order of magnitude change in @xmath65 corresponds to about @xmath66 orders of magnitude in @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the projected density gives a statistical measure of the true three - dimensional over - density even when it is projected over 110  .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , one can estimate the sfr from the rest ",
    "frame uv luminosity density @xmath68 in the range @xmath69@xmath70   : @xmath71 for a salpeter initial mass function , covering the range 0.1100  .",
    "this relation applies only to galaxies with continuous star formation over time scales of @xmath72 yr or longer . @xcite",
    "have shown that for a small sample of lbgs , estimates of sfr from eq .",
    "[ eq : kennicutt ] are consistent with the sfr inferred from  line fluxes .",
    "we estimated the rest ",
    "frame luminosity densities ( in ) of the 334  lbgs in our mosaic images from the standard expression @xmath73 and from the luminosity distance .",
    "the luminosity was corrected for dust extinction .",
    "the amount of dust extinction ( @xmath74 ) is estimated simultaneously with the estimation of the photometric redshift @xmath75 .",
    "however , we found , using mock catalogs , that @xmath74 recovered by hyperz is biased : @xmath76 these mock catalogs were created from the same galaxy templates , with the same extinction law used in the redshift fitting and restricted to our redshift range of interest @xmath77 .",
    "we used the @xmath5-band ( @xmath78   ) flux to estimate the sfr ; this filter corresponds to a rest - frame wavelength of 2000    for @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "we used the @xcite extinction curve   to estimate @xmath79 , and the dust corrected sfr ( @xmath80 ) follows from @xmath81 and eq .",
    "[ eq : kennicutt ] .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath82 selected with eq .",
    "[ eq : slicecut ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr - density ] shows the dust - corrected star formation rate ( sfr@xmath83 ) as a function of the normalized local density @xmath84 where @xmath7 is the surface density within the 5th nearest neighbor , i.e. @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is its median in each of our three mosaic fields .",
    "the local over - density @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "we use the normalized density in order to combine our several fields given that they do not contain the same mean number of lbgs per unit area .",
    "error bars are shown for 20 randomly selected galaxies .",
    "there is no detectable difference between the distribution of sfrs of lbgs in low - density environments and those in high - density environments .",
    "we used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to determine whether or not the galaxies in high density regions with @xmath89 are a random subset of those at @xmath90 , i.e. they have the same sfr distribution .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr - density ] shows that we can not reject the null hypothesis : the sample with @xmath90 and the sample with @xmath91 are indistinguishable .",
    "similarly , a pearson correlation test gives a @xmath92-value of @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , there could be a correlation only at the 32%  confidence level .",
    "we repeated the analysis for higher redshift slices , ( @xmath94 , 3.2 , and 3.3 ) and find similar results .    using the gif2 simulations of section  [ section : simulations ] , we performed monte - carlo simulations to test whether or not the scatter in the @xmath7@xmath63 relation is responsible for our null - result .",
    "we selected randomly about a third of the simulated lbgs to match our sample size of 334  lbgs .",
    "these simulated lbgs were assigned a sfr using sfr@xmath95 , where @xmath63 is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare : n5:n10 ] , @xmath96 is the slope of the simulated sfr - density relation , and @xmath97 is the observed mean sfr in our data .",
    "noise with the same properties as in the data ( i.e. @xmath98sfr ) was added to sfr@xmath99 .",
    "note that these mock catalogs have the scatter between @xmath7 and @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare : n5:n10 ] ) built in .",
    "we repeated our analysis of sfr@xmath99 versus @xmath7 1000 times for values of @xmath96 spanning @xmath100 $ ] .    at @xmath11 ,",
    "the sfr decreases by a factor of 5 over 2 decade in density @xcite , i.e. @xmath101 . in this case",
    ", the pearson correlation test gives a probability smaller than @xmath102 ( or @xmath103-@xmath104 ) of finding no correlation .",
    "even if we artificially increase the noise by a factor as large as 2.5 , as if we had underestimated our errors by such a factor , we find that there is less than a 0.1%  chance of finding no correlation if the @xmath13 sfr - density relation were as steep as at @xmath11 . if the @xmath13 sfr - density relation were not as steep , but were 3.6 times flatter ( @xmath105 ) , we would still have detected a correlation at the 2-@xmath104 level .",
    "as advocated by @xcite , because the local density has a signal - to - noise ratio much lower than the other physical quantities , it may be preferable to compute the mean density at constant galaxy properties ( e.g. , sfr , @xmath106 , color , etc . ) . the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : density - sfr ] shows the over - density @xmath87 as a function of sfr . the running median and the 1-@xmath104 spread",
    "are shown by the thick line and the error bars , respectively . again , this plot reveals no evidence of an sfr - density relation .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of galaxy color on density .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : density - sfr ] shows the over - density @xmath87 as a function of the observed - frame @xmath107 .",
    "again , the running median and the 1-@xmath104 spread are shown .",
    "the rest - frame uv colors of lbgs do not appear to change with environment .",
    "we note that this non dependence of rest - frame uv color for blue galaxies such as lbgs is similar to the results of @xmath11 surveys : in contrast to galaxies on the red sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mean color of blue galaxies is only weakly dependent on environment @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out an environment dependence of the mean _ rest - frame _ optical colors ( or age ) of lbgs given that we sample only @xmath108 .",
    "future rest - frame optical observations should address possible variations of the rest - frame optical colors of lbgs with environment .",
    "from our wide - field images , covering a total of 0.90 deg@xmath2 , we selected @xmath109 lbgs in several redshift slices @xmath110  mpc ( co - moving ) deep spanning the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "we computed the sfr from the uv luminosity at rest wavelength @xmath111   . using mock catalogs from the gif2 simulations ,",
    "we show that our photometric redshift accuracy is sufficient to statistically distinguish between low- and high - density regions using projected density estimators such as the density within the fifth nearest neighbor @xmath7 .",
    "our main results are as follows : we find that ( 1 ) there is no evidence of an sfr - density relation at @xmath13 , and ( 2 ) the rest - frame uv colors of lbgs do not appear to change with environment .    using monte - carlo simulations and the same projected density estimators that we applied to our data , we find a probability smaller than @xmath102 of finding no correlation if the steep @xmath11 sfr - density relation were present in our data .",
    "if the @xmath13 sfr - density relation were about four times flatter than the @xmath11 relation , we would still have detected a correlation at the 2-@xmath104 level .",
    "we conclude that , unless the @xmath13 sfr - density relation is even flatter , we would have detected it in our data .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to surveys at @xmath11 and @xmath112 that have shown that the mean sfr is strongly dependent on the local galaxy density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very few predictions have been made of how the sfr - density relation should evolve from @xmath109 to the present .",
    "recently , @xcite , using smooth particle hydrodynamic cosmological simulations , showed that the sfr - density relation is expected to be present as early as @xmath113 , but not at @xmath28 ( see their fig .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed description of the physical mechanisms at play .",
    "our observed non - dependence of sfr on environment supports the theoretical results of @xcite .",
    "naturally , our sample is not representative of the entire galaxy population at @xmath13 ; it is biased towards blue star - forming galaxies and does not include the red population unveiled by the faint infrared extragalactic survey @xcite . with the present data , we are unable to rule out the existence of a sfr - density relation if one were to include this redder population .    we thank the anonymous referee for his / her comments that led to an improved analysis .",
