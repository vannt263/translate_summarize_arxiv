    "nonetheless , these measures are not always sufficient to prevent progressive collapse @xcite . moreover , even though the serious damage amplification due to dynamics has been exhaustively pointed out in @xcite , static analyses are still used in the context of the alpm .    developing efficient tools to evaluate structural robustness and to prove the effectiveness of measures aimed at preventing progressive collapse is therefore an important issue and today several algorithms and models are available in literature . a simplified approach to take dynamics and impacts between falling elements into account",

    "for instance , we know that the loss of external columns from the facades or the corners of a buildings are the most serious scenarios where , according to the alpm method , one column is instantaneously removed ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . moreover , it was shown that beam - column connections are critical points of failure initiation @xcite and that catenary effects in the floor slabs can remarkably improve robustness @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , if the starting damage is more serious than a single column removal , global primary mechanisms can be expected also for larger and more brittle structures . in case of multiple column removal ,",
    "progressive crushing or buckling of the columns is a possible global primary collapse mechanism that was not observed in this context .",
    "we showed that structures with minimal plastic capacity and symmetrically reinforced beams are robust towards a single column removal . on the contrary ,",
    "frames with asymmetric reinforcement would experience partial collapse even if made of elements with large plastic capacity .    if a local primary collapse mechanism is triggered , the final extent of the collapse depends on secondary mechanisms driven by collisions between the structural elements .",
    "we showed that damage can not widely propagate in structures with small plastic capacity since brittle failures compartmentalise the system .",
    "differently , structures with large plastic capacity tend to collapse entirely after a sequence of base cutting .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that , in presence of large plastic capacity , we studied frames with thin structural elements . in facts , columns with larger and thus more realistic cross sectional size and reinforcement would not fail because of base cutting .",
    "collision - driven mechanisms also determine the outcome of the fragmentation process .",
    "we showed that the fragment mass distribution does not depend on the strength and stiffness of the structural elements .",
    "it is namely influenced by the plastic capacity of the elements . in structures with large plastic capacity",
    "the fragments are more massive and represent an extra cost in controlled demolitions processes .    in the present paper , for clearer interpretability of the results , we limited ourselves to simple geometry , collisions , and constitutive models . implementing more sophisticated collision models , e.g. using polyhedral discrete elements , or enabling discrete elements to fragment ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as rate effects are future challenges .",
    "we also neglected shear failures , since the structural elements were sufficiently small and slender , but this hypothesis should be removed to deal with structures made of large elements .",
    "these models should also be refined if the aim is to simulate in detail the collapse of specific real buildings . nevertheless , already at the present state",
    ", several interesting studies can be conducted to analyze the response to earthquakes and to investigate the influence of material disorder , geometric uncertainties , overall geometry , and structural connections .",
    "experimental validation remains problematic in the field of progressive collapse , because of difficulty in monitoring collapse of complex buildings , and due to problems concerning repeatability of experiments .",
