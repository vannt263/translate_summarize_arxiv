    "the discovery of millisecond oscillations in thermonuclear x - ray bursts provided the first direct measurements of the spin frequencies of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of neutron stars rotating with millisecond periods in ns - lmxbs was suggested more than a decade previously @xcite and is key in understanding the relation of lmxbs and millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "x - ray burst oscillation sources form two distinct classes : `` fast oscillators '' with frequencies close to twice the frequency difference of the khz quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) seen in the persistent emission , and `` slow oscillators '' with frequencies near the difference of the khz qpo frequencies @xcite .",
    "if the khz qpo frequency difference is close to the spin frequency of the neutron star , then the slow oscillators have a burst oscillation frequency close to the spin frequency , while the fast oscillators produce signals at twice the spin frequency .",
    "the fast oscillators produce burst oscillations predominately , but not exclusively , in photospheric radius expansion bursts , while the slow oscillators produce oscillations in bursts both with and without photospheric radius expansion @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the difference between the two classes is a physical difference and not a selection effect .",
    "the nature of this physical difference is unknown .    if the fast oscillators indicate twice the spin frequency and the slow oscillators indicate the spin frequency , then the spin frequency distribution of neutron stars in x - ray bursters is clustered with a maximum value near 400  hz .",
    "clustering in the spin frequency distribution has been variously interpreted as evidence for very efficient mass ejection by rapidly rotating neutron stars in binaries @xcite , a gravitational radiation limit on the spin - up of accreting neutron stars @xcite and for the existence of a phase change in superdense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "increasing the sample of sources from which burst oscillations are detected is crucial for determining the physical nature of the difference between the fast and slow oscillators and in accurately measuring the spin frequency distribution of neutron stars in lmxbs . here , we describe observations made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) following the detection of x - ray bursts from the transient source sax j1748.9 - 2021 located in the globular cluster ngc 6440 .",
    "we report the discovery of millisecond oscillations in one x - ray burst . because the source is located in a globular cluster , the distance is known and accurate luminosities can be calculated .",
    "we find that the peak luminosity of the radius expansion bursts is consistent with the eddington limit for a @xmath3 and 10  km radius neutron star with hydrogen - poor matter .",
    "we describe the source and our observations in  2 , the x - ray bursts in  3 , the persistent emission in  4 , and conclude in  5 with a few comments on the nature of the difference between the fast and slow x - ray burst oscillators .",
    "ngc 6440 is a globular cluster at a distance of @xmath4  kpc @xcite and located near the galactic center .",
    "bright , transient x - ray emission coincident with ngc 6440 was first detected with oso-7 and uhuru in december 1971 @xcite .",
    "strong x - ray outbursts were found , again , in august 1998 @xcite and august 2001 @xcite .",
    "the peak luminosities of the outbursts were near @xmath5 .",
    "the durations of the outbursts were from one to a few months .",
    "the 1998 and 2001 outbursts are from the same object @xcite identified with the optical star referred to as v2 in @xcite . whether the 1971 outburst is from the same object or one of the other , currently quiescent , lmxbs in ngc 6440 @xcite is unknown .",
    "type - i x - ray bursts detected in 1998 and 2001 with the wide - field camera ( wfc ) on bepposax and a high resolution image of the cluster obtained with chandra while the source was active during 2001 clearly identify the source sax j1748.9 - 2021 with v2 and as an accreting neutron star @xcite .",
    "the rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) light curve of the 2001 outburst is shown in fig .",
    "[ asmlc ] .",
    "the outburst started around mjd 52129 ( 8 august 2001 ) , as reported by the mit asm team .",
    "this initial event was relatively weak at its peak and lasted only 12 days .",
    "after a pause of about 20 days , ngc 6440 again became bright in x - rays .",
    "the x - ray emission rose gradually over about 10 days and then jumped rapidly to the peak flux level near 12 asm c / s , which corresponds to a flux near @xmath6 in the 210  kev band or a luminosity of @xmath7 for a source located at the distance of ngc 6440 .",
    "high flux levels persisted for about 20 days , and then the source rapidly declined and became undetectable with the asm .",
    "the x - ray bursts found with the wfc during the 2001 outburst triggered an rxte target - of - opportunity program which led to an observation on 2001 september 28 and multiple observations during october 7 - 16 .",
    "the total observation time was 81  ks .",
    "our observations occurred during the bright phase of the outburst and in the initial part of the final decline .",

    "we note that we did use the most recent response matrices , which include a correction for the spectral response due to the loss of the propane layer .",
    "spectra were accumulated for 0.25  s intervals and corrected for deadtime effects .",

    "the fluxes reported from the rxte pca with pcus 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 operating ( which was the case during bursts 1 and 5 ) are systematically a factor of 1.2 higher than from other instruments . assuming that this factor represents an error in the absolute calibration of the pca @xcite , we reduce the flux by this factor and find an average peak luminosity for these two bursts of @xmath28 which is consistent with the eddington luminosity for a @xmath3 and 10  km radius neutron star with hydrogen - poor matter @xcite .",

    "bursts 4 , 8 and 9 show no evidence of radius expansion , no temperature drops , and decay more slowly than the other bursts .    using high time resolution data ( merged event lists from the event and burst catcher modes ) with no energy selection , we computed power spectra for overlapping 3  s intervals of data , with 0.25  s between the starts of successive intervals , and searched for excess power in the range 100 - 1000  hz .",
    "we found oscillations in burst 9 , with a maximum leahy normalized power of 38.7 at a frequency of 409.7  hz , occurring in the burst decay about 5  s after the burst peak . given 2700 independent frequencies in the 900  hz interval searched , the signal power corresponds to a probability of chance occurrence of @xmath29 , equivalent to a @xmath30 detection . the dynamical power spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "we did not find any statistically significant signals .",
    "our discovery of burst oscillations from the x - ray transient in ngc 6440 adds another source to the 10 sources previously known to exhibit burst oscillations . as described above , x - ray burst oscillation sources form two classes : `` slow oscillators '' versus `` fast oscillators '' with the distinction being whether the burst oscillation frequency is close to once or twice the frequency difference of the khz qpos in the persistent emission @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the fast and slow oscillators is different with the fast oscillators being much more likely to produce burst oscillations in photospheric radius expansion bursts which indicates that there is a physical difference between the two classes @xcite .",
    "if the khz qpo frequency difference is close to the spin frequency of the neutron star , then the slow oscillators produce signals at close to the spin frequency and the fast oscillators at twice the spin frequency .",
    "the fast oscillators have frequencies in the range 521 - 620  hz , while the slow oscillators have frequencies in the range 270 - 363  hz .",
    "the 410  hz burst oscillation frequency of sax j1748.9 - 2021 lies between the two classes .",
    "the detection of oscillations during a non - radius expansion burst and the absence of detections in radius expansion bursts is more consistent with the phenomenology of the slow oscillators .",
    "however , conclusive assignment of the source to either class must wait until khz qpos are detected in the persistent emission .",
    "if sax j1748.9 - 2021 is a slow oscillator , then it has the highest frequency of any of the slow oscillators and the highest inferred spin frequency of any burst source , but it is slower than the spin frequency of the millisecond x - ray pulsar xte j1751 - 305 @xcite . if it is a fast oscillator , it has the lowest frequency of any of the fast oscillators and the lowest inferred spin frequency of any burst source , but it is faster than the millisecond x - ray pulsar xte j0929 - 314 @xcite .    the dichotomy between slow and fast oscillators may be related to the magnetic field configuration of the neutron star . diametrically opposed magnetic poles provide a natural means to produce oscillations with once or twice the spin frequency .",
    "however , the low upper limits placed on the subharmonic for fast burst oscillators are a serious problem for models containing two diametrically opposite hot spots because of the high degree of symmetry required @xcite .",
    "the problem is particularly severe when oscillations are detected early in the burst rise because nearly simultaneous ignition of the hot spots would be required .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field of a neutron star which is spinning - up or down is determined by interactions between superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons within the stellar core @xcite . for a spinning - up star , quantized magnetic flux tubes in the superconducting core move inwards towards the rotation axis @xcite . for the ns - lmxbs of interest here , it is likely that sufficient accretion has occurred during spin - up so that the neutron star crust has been replaced several times , giving a corresponding movement of the surface magnetic fields even if neither eddy current dissipation nor creep in the crust has been effective .",
    "since accretion is still occurring , the surface magnetic field emerging from the crust should closely follow the configuration of the core magnetic field .    for the case",
    "where all of the emerging magnetic flux returns to the same spin hemisphere , the magnetic flux is squeezed into a small polar cap where the spin axis intersects the crust @xcite . for spin - up from periods near 10  s to periods of milliseconds , both the north and south magnetic poles move close to one rotational pole and the net magnetic dipole field becomes nearly orthogonal to the rotation axis ",
    "an orthogonal rotator .",
    "the local surface magnetic field strength within the magnetic polar cap is then much higher than the dipole field , typically @xmath36 for a dipole field of @xmath37 . for the case",
    "where flux returns in the opposite hemisphere , the magnetic field is confined to small polar caps at the north and south spin poles .",
    "the dipole magnetic field in this spun - up configuration is oriented nearly parallel to the spin axis  an aligned rotator .",
    "radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are similar to ns - lmxbs , indeed they may be the descendants of the ns - lmxbs , in that they have experienced significant spin - up subsequent to their formation .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field in radio pulsars can be constrained using pulse profile and polarization measurements .",
    "the fraction of msps in the galactic disk which are either orthogonal rotators or nearly aligned rotators ( exactly aligned rotators would not be pulsars , so there must be a slight offset , @xmath38 , of the magnetic field from the rotation axis ) is significantly higher than for canonical pulsars @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this overabundance of orthogonal and nearly aligned rotators in msps can be understood as a consequence of the magnetic field evolution of a neutron star with a superfluid and superconducting core , as described above .",
    "the orthogonal and nearly aligned msps represent the two endpoints of the magnetic field evolution of a spun - up neutron star",
    ".    the magnetic field configuration in lmxbs should be even more tightly compressed towards the rotation poles than in msps because in lmxbs the neutron star is still actively accreting and spinning up .",
    "the same physical processes which cause the migration of the magnetic poles toward the rotation axis during spin up cause migration away from the rotation axis during spin down .",
    "because msps are spinning down , some motion of the magnetic field away from the poles has occurred ( the magnitude of the motion is small , since the magnitude of the spin down is small compared to that of the spin up ) , thereby decreasing the level of symmetry between the poles .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the same dichotomy may apply to ns - lmxbs .",
    "the orthogonal rotator geometry provides a natural means to produce oscillations at twice the spin frequency , while a slightly misaligned parallel rotator would produce oscillations at the spin frequency .",
    "the dichotomy between the fast and slow burst oscillators would then be related to physical differences between the magnetic field configurations of the neutron stars .",
    "the magnetic field geometry of orthogonal rotators would produce a high degree of symmetry between the two magnetic poles which would be located very close to each other . this would naturally suppress the signal at the 1/2 subharmonic , i.e.  the spin frequency , in the fast oscillators and allow nearly simultaneous ignition since the two poles are located very close together .",
    "@xcite estimate that spin up from 10  s to millisecond periods compresses the magnetic field into a region with a radius of about @xmath39 around the spin axis . for a typical neutron star radius of @xmath40 , the poles",
    "would then be less than @xmath41 from the spin axis and be antipodal within @xmath42 as @xcite conclude is required to explain the lack of harmonics and sub - harmonics in burst oscillations .",
    "the requirement that there be no more than 2% difference in the relative brightness of the two poles in the main and decaying portions of bursts @xcite is more difficult to address , but the high degree of symmetry between the two poles and their close location for orthogonal rotators suggest that such uniformity may be achieved several rotation periods after ignition of the burst .",
    "we greatly appreciate the assistance by the duty scientists of the bepposax science operations center in the near to real - time wfc data analysis and the efforts of the rxte team , particularly jean swank and evan smith , in performing these target of opportunity observations .",
