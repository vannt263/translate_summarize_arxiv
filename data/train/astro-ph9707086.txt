    "x - ray observations of supernova remnants have been stimulated by recent reports of nonthermal power - law x - ray detections suggesting supernovae as sites of charged particle accelerations and sources of cosmic rays . the first strong evidence for charged particle acceleration near supernova shock fronts in the x - ray energy band is demonstrated by the morphological and spectral correlation between x - ray and radio emission from the bright ne and sw rims of sn 1006 @xcite .",
    "the brightest radio emission regions show almost featureless power law x - ray spectra when compared with sn 1006 central region which is dominated by emission lines of highly ionized elements in a non - equilibrium ionization thermal plasma .",
    "the nonthermal x - ray component has been modeled as a synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated to @xmath0100 tev within shock fronts @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the radio spectrum is produced by synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated to @xmath0gev energies with the radio power - law index being less steep than the x - ray power - law index .",
    "several similar evidences also have been demonstrated by asca measurement of rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite and ic 443 @xcite , and rxte and osse measurements of cas a @xcite .",
    "osse with a total accumulation time of 15@xmath410@xmath5 detector - seconds , detected a hard continuum between 40 - 150 kev from cas a snr at a 4@xmath6 confidence with a flux of @xmath09@xmath410@xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 s@xmath10 kev@xmath10 at 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the detection is the hardest x - ray detection from a snr without plerionic source .",
    "however , the shape of the continuum has not been strongly constrained .",
    "the continuum can either be a bremsstrahlung with kt@xmath1135 kev or a power law with @xmath33.06 .",
    "in this paper , we use the 2 - 30 kev rxte / pca too and the 40 - 150 kev cgro / osse cas a data to better determine the shape of cas a hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the rxte / pca data used in this analysis is the too by rxte on aug . 2 , 1996 with a total observing time of @xmath04000 sec .",
    "we fit the 2 - 30 kev pca data simultaneously with the 40 - 150 kev osse data .",
    "the results of fitting several models with one or two continuum plus about six emission lines from si , s , ar , ca , and fe are shown in table 1 .",
    "the line widths are fixed to 100 ev and the hydrogen column density toward cas a is fixed at 1@xmath410@xmath12 h @xmath9@xcite .",
    "we find that a single thermal bremsstrahlung model for the data can be ruled out .",
    "nevertheless , a single power law model gives a mediocre fit .",
    "we also find the two models that best fit the exosat@xcite and _ tenma_@xcite data can not give acceptable fits to the pca and osse data . a two component model , either the bremsstrahlung + bremsstrahlung or the bremsstrahlung + power law , each gives an equally good fit . in figure 1 for the current interest in a nonthermal power law model , we show the result of the thermal bremsstrahlung + power - law model fit to the data .",
    "the power law continuum is detected with a higher confidence level and the power - law index is more tightly constrained than using the osse data alone@xcite .",
    "the pca and osse data is consistent only at a 3.8% level with the x - ray bremsstrahlung from accelerated mev electrons at shock fronts as suggested by asvarov et al.@xcite which would have @xmath13 + 1.5=2.26 where @xmath14 is the radio spectral index .",
    "rxte pca + hexte in its ao-1 observing period detected a continuum between 10 and 60 kev@xcite .",
    "the continuum is fitted well with a model of two raymond - smith thermal bremsstrahlung of kt = 0.7 kev and kt = 2.8 kev and a power law with @xmath152.4 which exponentially steepens at e - fold 50 kev .",
    "the shape of the model is in good agreement with the result we find here .",
    "the bremsstrahlung + bremsstrahlung model is expected in the reverse shock model . in this model ,",
    "the hot temperature ( t@xmath023 kev ) of the shocked circumstellar gas behind the blast - wave is consistent with the assumption that the blast - wave velocity is slightly larger than the observed median - filament velocity of 5500 km / s@xcite and the circumstellar density @xmath161.5 @xmath17 . the shocked gas temperature behind the reverse shock of t@xmath04 kev suggests the swept up mass is @xmath06 m@xmath18 and @xmath191.4 @xmath17@xcite .",
    "a summary of the detected nonthermal continuum from four snrs is shown in table 2 .",
    "cas a is of interest because from the 4 snrs with measured nonthermal power - laws , it is the youngest , has the strongest magnetic field , its detected nonthermal energy is the highest , and it has the steepest x - ray and radio power - law indexes , of four snrs with measured nonthermal power law . in figure 2 , we show for cas a , ic 443 , and sn 1006 how close their detected hard x - ray energies to the maximum synchrotron energies .",
    "the synchrotron energy is related to the maximum electron energy which is limited by the synchrotron energy loss and the snr s age .",
    "cas a , as the brightest radio snr source , has the most intense magnetic field and therefore it causes the large synchrotron energy loss which limits cas a s maximum electron energy .",
    "figure 2 shows that the hard x - ray emission detected from cas a by osse is near the cutoff synchrotron energy or indirectly to the maximum electron energy .",
    "further cas a measurements by osse may detect the cutoff energy and hence would provide the evidence that the nonthermal power law emission is the synchrotron radiation from accelerated electrons at the shock fronts near the maximum energy .",
    "another evidence of the synchrotron radiation being the process for the nonthermal emission is the steepening of spectral index from radio to x - ray energy .",
    "it has been suggested that the turnover or break @xmath00.25 kev is observed in sn 1006 spectra@xcite .",
    "we expect the turnover in cas a spectra is @xmath01 - 10 kev due to cas a s strong magnetic field .",
    "however , in order to observe this turnover in cas a spectra , an x - ray imaging detector is needed because cas a s thermal bremsstrahlung contributes substantially near this energy .",
