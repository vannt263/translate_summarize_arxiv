    "the classic theory of electron field emission from a cold metal surface due to fowler and nordheim ( fn ) @xcite was one of the earliest applications of wave mechanics since its foundation in the early 1920 s . with increased interest in field emission processes , especially for use in display screens @xcite",
    ", it is worth examining closely the foundations of this theory . as well as",
    "metal - vacuum interfaces , proposed applications of the theory includes graphite - vacuum , graphite - insulator - vacuum , carbon - nanotube - vacuum and schottky junctions @xcite . since our approach can be generalized to other cases of interfaces between dissimilar media , it may have application to the systems discussed by mott and gurney @xcite and herring @xcite",
    ". these other cases might include vacuum breakdown and electrical forming processes @xcite . in section [ experiments ]",
    "we show that our new analysis removes discrepancies of many orders of magnitude between theory and experiment .    in the fn theory , the role of the fermi surface ,",
    "fermi - dirac statistics and in particular the unique property of quantum mechanical tunnelling were key concepts .",
    "the essentially equilibrium distribution of electrons is modeled by a one dimensional ( @xmath1 dependent only ) hamiltonian : @xmath2 where all energies are measured with the same reference as the effective potential @xmath3 .",
    "then the current density @xmath4 of the emitted electrons is given by an integral over the energy @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 gives the number of electrons within @xmath8 that emerge form the metal per second per unit area , with @xmath9  an appropriate lower energy reference .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is easily expressed as the product of a quantum mechanical tunnelling transmission coefficient @xmath11 and a fermi type supply function @xmath12 : @xmath13}\\right \\rbrace , \\label{supplyfunction}\\ ] ] in which @xmath14 is the fermi energy . in view of the complexity of the schrodinger equation ,",
    "the transmission problem was originally treated within a wkb approximation or variants of it @xcite : @xmath15    , \\label{wkbtransmission}\\ ] ] in which @xmath16  and @xmath17  are the classical turning points of the potential @xmath3 .",
    "it is a well known result however that the validity of the wkb approximation involves a criterion , see section [ wkbvalidity ] , that can be derived from the requirement that the variation of the debroglie wavelength of the electron must be less than the dimension of the region of tunnelling @xcite .",
    "this restriction on the validity of the fn theory was unfortunately not discussed in many of the earlier papers , including the classic paper of @xcite .",
    "the limitations of the wkb approach are well known , however , in the treatment of thermionic emission ; a common technique for improving the calculation@xcite is to make a parabolic approximation to the top of of the barrier .",
    "nevertheless , fn theory has been applied in regimes where it is not valid . in section [ imagefreecase ]",
    "we shall examine the image - free problem exactly , , these results are actually very relevant to the latter , which however we shall not take up here in this paper .",
    "] whose solution in one dimension is amenable to analytical treatment in terms of airy type functions .",
    "some preliminary assessment of the fn - wkb can already be made for this case , which is a preamble to the full image problem which we shall treat in section [ withimage ] by various analytical methods .",
    "interestingly the tunnelling problem close to the barrier top appears to be amenable to analytical treatment as well and has not been published to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we shall note that the failure of the wkb criteria coincides quite closely to this regime , hence the availability of analytical results are extremely welcomed . next we shall note that the role of screening has also been omitted in the original fn theory .",
    "we shall introduce the additional screening potentials in section [ screening ] and thereby propose that this is one mechanism for a significant barrier reduction , in addition to negative electron affinity attributed to diamond like carbon systems . in section [ experiments ]",
    "we shall apply our theory to the analysis of experimental data for carbon field emitters@xcite . regardless of reasonable assumptions of point tip field enhancement effects",
    ", we shall see that the fn theory does not even get close to the order of magnitude agreement with the data by comparison with ours .",
    "we shall conclude in section [ conclusion ] with a summary of our results , postponing further solutions of the problem involving screening to a future paper .",
    "following @xcite it is straightforward to derive the criterion for the validity of wkb : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the external field and we shall ignore the electron image for the moment . here",
    "@xmath20 is the electron momentum so that : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the work function . assuming a carrier effective mass equal to the free electron mass and inserting numerical values appropriate to a field in v/@xmath23 m and a work function in ev , ( which shall be our units throughout this paper ) gives @xmath24 in which the tunnelling length @xmath1 has been set to zero , representing the best case for wkb , the very top of the barrier ( @xmath1 is typically of the order of nm ) .",
    "typical numerical values for @xmath25 are given table  [ tab_1 ] , where we see that the wkb approximation begins to be questionable for fields above about @xmath26 for typical work function values and is certainly seriously questionable in the range close to dielectric breakdown fields which are typically @xmath27 .",
    "a smaller effective mass such as for p - si where ( @xmath28 for holes ) would increase @xmath25 further . later on in the paper we shall show further anomalies with the fn theory when we are close to this limit of validity . in order to proceed and be able to assess the approximation further",

    "we shall start with the image free tunnelling problem given by the schrodinger equation : @xmath33\\psi(x)=0 , \\label{schrodinger1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath34 with the potential given by @xcite : @xmath35 here @xmath36 under normal circumstances is zero which yields the work function @xmath22 as the barrier height and @xmath19 is as before the applied external field .",
    "for later convenience we shall recast eq([schrodinger1 ] ) into the more compact form : @xmath37 with @xmath38 in which @xmath19 is measured in @xmath39 . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    "this elementary quantum exercise does not seem to have been fully documented in the literature , although variants of it have been scattered around @xcite . following landau and lifshitz @xcite",
    ", we shall transform to the new variable @xmath40 .",
    "then equation ( [ schrodinger2 ] ) in region 2 becomes the typical airy s equation : @xmath41 however some care needs to be exercised in selecting the appropriate type of airy functions , since the standard ai function has asymptotic form @xcite : @xmath42 as this also contains a reflected wave , it is not appropriate to our boundary conditions .",
    "the correct approach is to revert to the original 1/3 fractional bessel functions definition for the airy functions and then construct appropriate linear combinations to yield the forward travelling wave solution only .",
    "this approach of course leads to a modified appropriate hankel function which as we shall see has the correct asymptotic form required .",
    "it is this construction that seems to be rather rarely seen in the literature except perhaps in the wkb derivation of moll @xcite . with this proviso ,",
    "we can write down the solution for the wave functions of equation ( [ schrodinger3 ] ) as : @xmath43 & in region                    2,\\cr } \\label{wavefunctions1}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by bessel functions of order @xmath47 , here defined as : @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "note however that analytical continuation to negative @xmath50 requires some care : see appendix a. it is then straightforward to obtain the reflection and transmission amplitudes by matching the wave functions and their derivatives at the interface @xmath51 .",
    "we provide the results here in terms of @xmath52 which is a slightly modified hankel function @xmath53 where @xmath54 while @xmath55 .",
    "an important check must be made to these formulas which requires that the transmission coefficient : @xmath56 and reflection coefficient : @xmath57 satisfy the unitarity property @xmath58 .",
    "this is easily checked to be the case when appropriate use is made of the wronskian identity : @xmath59 for sufficiently small fields , we can obtain an asymptotic expansion ( where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) that yields : @xmath62 the prefactor being a new result not obtainable within wkb . for convenience we set @xmath63 which for @xmath22 of order @xmath64 is adequate as a lower bound ( at room temperatures ) , the exception being very narrow band semiconductors which we are not concerned with here .",
    "we shall at the moment ignore any possible barrier height lowering ( i.e. image free case ) so that @xmath65 is the vacuum level and consider tunnelling near the fermi level , so that @xmath66 and thus @xmath67 .",
    "then we see that the above prefactor differs from the wkb result by a mere factor of two i.e. : @xmath68 that this asymptotic result is valid for only small fields is clearly seen now for otherwise if we naively allow the field to be large , then we could arrive at an unphysical result in which @xmath69 which is absurd .",
    "in fact this occurs for @xmath70 when @xmath19 reaches the order of @xmath71 .",
    "hence the use of the wkb formula for large transmissions without knowledge of the prefactor in the transmission can be dangerous .",
    "unfortunately this caution does not seem to have been exercised by good and mller @xcite , nor by murphy and good @xcite .",
    "the latter have derived widely used criteria @xcite for the validity of fn theory on the basis of the wkb integrand properties equation ( [ wkbtransmission ] ) alone , which is thus a logically inadequate procedure .",
    "if we examine the classic fn formula for the emission current : @xmath72 in which @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given in terms of elliptic integrals , for @xmath75 say , the exponent practically vanishes at @xmath76 .",
    "hence the entire emission current comes from the supply function which is the @xmath77 factor and , as discussed above , this can be untenable .",
    "in fact it is well known from elementary quantum mechanics that the transmission coefficient is in general not unity at the top of the barrier @xcite .    later on , in section [ withimage ]",
    ", we shall see that an exact solution is obtainable for the full image theory at the top of the barrier , in which the transmission coefficient has a finite value less than unity , but nevertheless with significant tunnelling current contributions .",
    "as far as we are aware , this solution has not been noted in the field emission literature for the last 40 years . in figure",
    "[ fig 1 ] we provide two curves that compare the exact transmission coefficient equation ( [ transmissioncefficient ] ) for the image free case against the asymptotic formula equation ( [ asymplimit2 ] ) close to the fermi level for very large fields where the latter becomes problematic .",
    "fortunately these fields are very large and being much greater than typical breakdown fields this failure is unimportant in practice .",
    "we note that for smaller fields figure [ fig 2 ] the wkb formula is quite good , in spite of its failure to satisfy our earlier criterion of section [ wkbvalidity ] .",
    "the accuracy of the wkb for small fields is however due to us staying away from the top of the barrier .",
    "we now compare equation ( [ asymplimit2 ] ) with the exact result equation ( [ transmissioncefficient ] ) as we approach the barrier , i.e. @xmath78 . one mechanism for this to occur could be due to a large image term i.e. schottky effect , but there are other screening effects as well as we shall see later .",
    "for simplicity we shall not include the image effect in the schrodinger equation yet but merely consider the effect of approaching the barrier top in the image free case first .",
    "here we can compare the results of three formulas , the exact equation ( [ transmissioncefficient ] ) , the asymptotic formula equation ( [ asymplimit1 ] ) and the standard wkb result in which the prefactor in equation ( [ asymplimit1 ] ) is missing : these are shown in figure  [ fig 3 ] , where we have set @xmath79 .",
    "here we see that for quite small fields @xmath80 , significant departures from wkb are found .",
    "these results motivate us to further include the schottky image term in the schrodinger equation which we take up in the next section .",

    "in particular for the matching conditions we are only interested in the solution near to @xmath104 which corresponds to the origin @xmath51 so that we can transform to the variable : @xmath105 which is small for our purpose @xmath106 so that equation ( [ schrodeqimagetop1 ] ) can be approximated by : @xmath107 the appropriate solution for the above is then given by the hankel function of order @xmath108 which upon transforming back to the original variables @xmath50 is given by : @xmath109 we can now obtain the transmission coefficient as was done in the previous section by matching the wave function and its derivative at the origin .",
    "the result is now given by : @xmath110 where the derivative of @xmath111 is easily shown to be given in terms of the hankel function of order @xmath112 : @xmath113 as usual we can verify that this solution satisfies unitarity @xmath58 through the use of the appropriate wronskian identities for the hankel functions .",
    "that this is satisfied exactly in spite of our approximation in equation ( [ schrodeqimagetop2 ] ) means that we have picked out the essential features in the theory .",
    "equation ( [ timage ] ) gives zero transmission at the top of the barrier because of a weak logarithmic singularity ( typical of the @xmath114 potential near the origin ) in @xmath115 .",
    "we may write @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a renormalization constant , which we can arbitrarily set to @xmath118 .",
    "physically , we may think of this as correcting for the situation in which the electron and the image charge are both at the interface by limiting the distance of closest approach to atomic dimensions .",

    "the two roots become : @xmath124 where @xmath125 and in the limit @xmath97 large reduces equation ( [ schrodeqimagetop2 ] ) to : @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "this poses no difficulties and the method outlined above can be adapted to the solution .",
    "we summarize the appropriate formulas without further ado : @xmath128 where : @xmath129 and @xmath130    log - linear plot of the exact transmission coefficient equation ( [ timage])(solid line ) vs the fn formula ( dashed line ) i.e. equation ( [ fncurrent ] ) less the prefactors in the full image case .",
    "f is in units of @xmath131 . ]    in figure [ fig4 ] we compare the transmission coefficient equation ( [ timage ] ) versus the fn formula equation ( [ fncurrent ] ) less the prefactors .",
    "we see that the fn formula is not only in error as we trespass the barrier giving a non physical value of @xmath69 , for the region near the top of the barrier ( around @xmath132 here ) , it drops exponentially fast as opposed to the exact solution .",
    "using equation ( [ timage2 ] ) we can estimate the current near the barrier top which occurs for @xmath133 700 v/@xmath23 in this case , remembering that we have considered @xmath22=1 ev and @xmath63 .",
    "hence for temperatures much less than @xmath134 , the current is obtained from the integral : @xmath135 which has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "we can however make an estimate using the approximate expression equation ( [ timage1 ] ) .",
    "we can set the fermi level at the top of the barrier and integrate only over a small region of order @xmath117 near to it , since outside this region the contributions are exponentially small .",
    "we choose @xmath117 according to equation ( [ deltadefn ] ) as before and thus the @xmath136 pre - factor dominates in the transmission coefficient since the logarithmic term is slowly varying in the region of integration .",
    "as we take @xmath137 which is large compared with @xmath117 , we now arrive at the expression for the current density as : @xmath138 note that the field dependence of the current is in this case @xmath139 which differs from the fn prediction of @xmath77 and could be experimentally discernable in view of its non - exponential dependence .",
    "we can now compare equation ( [ currentneartop2 ] ) with the standard fn formula equation ( [ fncurrent ] ) see figure [ fig5.eps ] .",

    "@xmath19 is in units of @xmath141 . ]",
    "having shown that we can have a large ( non - exponential ) current in spite of a smaller field than in the image - free case , due to proximity to the barrier top , we shall next examine other mechanisms by which the barrier lowering can occur , whose magnitude is comparable with , or might exceed the schottky image effect . the effect to consider",
    "is due to the dielectric screening of the applied field f which we shall take up next .",
    "screening is an important property of metals or dielectrics , and the mechanism itself plays a crucial role in the previous section in the form of the image potential which is a screening effect . in recent years",
    "there has been a revival of interest in screening , @xcite especially in semiconductors , where surface effects can significantly alter the properties of devices . on the surface the screening length , typically of the order of @xmath142 from thomas - fermi theory ranges between the order of a few   for metals to a few @xmath143 for semiconductors or even higher to tenths of mm due to surface effects since it is the charge carrier density at the surface layer that matters .",
    "the ( laplace ) screening problem for a flat surface is easily solved for an external field @xmath19 .",
    "this modifies the external potential @xmath3 in equation ( [ imagefreepotential ] ) by having a non - zero @xmath36 such that @xmath144 .",
    "we shall neglect an exponential penetration field inside which in fact modifies the inner potential to @xmath145 the latter leads to a 2d electron gas which requires a self - consistent theory to treat since this in turn affects our @xmath142 as already mentioned .",
    "further the proper inclusion of screening must now include its effects on the image potentials which pick up yukawa type terms .",
    "it suffices here to estimate the barrier lowering from our expression for @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath19 is in @xmath39 then a @xmath146 will completely wipe out a barrier of @xmath147 . for 3d",
    "this corresponds to a carrier density of order @xmath148 but for a 2d layer this can be down by a @xmath149 power i.e. @xmath150 . if we include the effects due to a diminished electron affinity as in the case of diamond - like carbon bonds , then we see that the present theory provides a strong candidate as an explanation for the high current densities in carbon granular samples recently observed in materials for field emission displays @xcite , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "comparison with experiments such as for carbon field emitters @xcite can be made by assuming that there is a barrier lowering mechanism such as the dielectric screening as mentioned above .",
    "the tunnelling current will then be assumed to be given by equation ( [ currentneartop2 ] ) but we shall include a factor @xmath151 to account for granularity or inefficient screening ( and hence barrier lowering ) which diminishes the current .",
    "this modifies equation ( [ currentneartop2 ] ) trivially to : @xmath152 in figure [ figx.eps ] we have plotted the results which shows that for a granularity factor of @xmath153 our results compare favorably with experiments @xcite bearing in mind that our results are only estimates and not accurate numerical evaluations . in particular the parameters as given in the figures have not been fine tuned in anyway . on the contrary without assuming a significant field enhancement due to pointed tips ,",
    "the fn theory is out by numerous orders of magnitude .",
    "however even with the assumption of a large field enhancement factor @xmath154 which is reasonable for ellipsoids @xcite , and a barrier lowering @xmath155 , the fn curve figure [ figx.eps ] does not in any way resemble the experimental data , a feature we have found to occur quite commonly in analyzing data from the carbon field emitting samples . note the vast order of magnitude differences and the fast drop in the slope of the fn curve which is shown more clearly in the inset to figure [ figx.eps ] .",
    "log - linear plot of the tunnelling current vs electric field @xmath19 , assuming that a significant barrier lowering mechanism ( @xmath156 ) , such as dielectric screening ( see text ) has occurred .",
    "the solid line is our theory , the dots are experimental points from tuck et al @xcite while the fn theory is given by the dash line . in addition a large field enhancement factor @xmath154 has to be assumed for the fn formula equation ( [ fncurrent ] ) . our result compares much more favourably with the experimental points than does the fn theory . ]    these results clearly show that our theory has captured some essential physics associated to tunnelling near the barrier top which may be relevant to the carbon field emitters .",
    "in conclusion we have presented a closer look at the traditional fn theory of field emission and found that the latter is untenable for calculations of emission currents when significant barrier lowering occurs .",
    "a full quantum mechanical solution of the problem provides us with an estimate which , coupled with a proposed barrier lowering due to screening or negative electron affinity , constitutes a reasonable order of magnitude estimate for the high current densities in samples with embedded particles , not available via fn theory .",
    "further work is necessary to provide more quantitative comparisons noting that the granularity of the systems would lead to less total current density although on the other hand some field enhancements due to shape effects @xcite not considered here might partially compensate for this loss .",

    "confusion arises with bessel functions of order @xmath47 due to special care needed to treat the phase factors : some popular mathematical software uses incorrect continuation formulae .",
    "firstly our convention is the same as watson s so that the appropriate continuation formula is given by :    @xmath157    an alternative approach is to perform the continuation for negative @xmath158 as : @xmath159 which is incorrect .",
    "the negative argument prevents the use of the first form of equation([watson1 ] ) .",
    "instead the branch cut properties requires the continuation formula @xcite : @xmath160 which holds similarly for the @xmath161 functions .",
    "then : @xmath162 without any complex phase factors .",
    "similarly @xmath46 picks up a minus sign : @xmath163 hence one has to manually continue the @xmath164 to the @xmath161 functions for negative arguments when if using the incorrect continuation , equation ( [ eq_error ] ) .",
    "we have found that mathematica v4.1 uses equation ( [ eq_error ] ) .",
    "the generic form of the full image problem is given by the following second order differential equation @xmath165 as before a straightforward linear transformation : @xmath166 leads to the following form : @xmath167 where @xmath168 , and @xmath88 .",
    "clearly the image free case @xmath89 reduces to the usual airy differential equation . equation ( [ eqna2 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath169 unfortunately this equation does not belong to the standard hypergeometric class and can not therefore be treated by the usual mathematical physics functions . however using the standard frobenius method one can obtain the following power series solutions .",
    "let @xmath170 then equation ( [ eqna4 ] ) leads to the following 5 term recursion relation for the determination of the coefficients @xmath171 : @xmath172 all the coefficients are well determined in terms of the coefficient @xmath173 .",
    "the first term satisfies @xmath174 giving @xmath175 which shows as expected that we shall have two linearly independent solutions .",
    "carrying on we have @xmath176 and @xmath177 notice that @xmath176 regardless but @xmath178 is only finite for @xmath179 i.e. @xmath180 .",
    "the following coefficients can be sequentially determined : @xmath181 and so on .",
    "the general 5 term recursion relation can be re - written as @xmath182 .",
    "\\label{eqna10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately there is no way to simplify this any further . when @xmath89 ( image free case ) the above in fact reduces to a two term relation given by : @xmath183 this immediately leads us to the two independent solutions , for @xmath184 @xmath185 and for @xmath186 @xmath187 which are the series expansions for the bessel functions of order @xmath47 .",
    "the oscillatory nature of these functions means that the convergence is in general poor and some more sophisticated re - summation method must be used to obtain in particular the asymptotic properties of these functions . in the next appendix we shall show just one method as to how this can be achieved .",
    "an alternative solution for the full image problem which is an effective re - summation of the previous power series solution that will allow us to perform numerical calculations , will now be shown .",
    "the approach is to first use a laplace transform on equation ( [ eqna1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath188 over some contour @xmath189 , then the resulting differential equation in @xmath111 becomes converted into a second - order differential equation in @xmath190 : @xmath191 it is easy to show that the solution for @xmath192 reduces to the airy integral where @xmath193",
    "so we shall factorize @xmath190 in the form : @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "the equation for @xmath196 now simplifies tremendously : @xmath197 unfortunately there is still no closed form solution for this equation although it can be proved that solutions for @xmath196 must be an entire function , by which we can develop an expansion as an infinite series : @xmath198 the boundary condition requires that when @xmath199 then @xmath200 . with this",
    "we can show that @xmath184 is the only allowed index .",
    "then we have the following 4 term recursion relation : @xmath201 the first few solutions are easily obtained : @xmath202 , @xmath203,@xmath204,@xmath205 and so on . as required only the first term survives in the limit @xmath206 .",
    "interestingly the 4 term relation equation ( [ eqnb5 ] ) can actually be reduced to a three term one .",
    "let @xmath207 then @xmath208 which may be more convenient for computation .",
