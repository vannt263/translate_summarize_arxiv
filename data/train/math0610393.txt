    "the main goal of this paper is to study the effective resistance between two finite sets of vertices in a random electric network with i.i.d resistances .",
    "the infinite grid @xmath6 will be the essential graph that we will focus on .",
    "let us first briefly describe our notation for a deterministic electrical network ( for more background , see doyle and snell @xcite , peres @xcite , lyons and peres @xcite and soardi @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be an unoriented locally finite graph with an at most countable set of vertices @xmath8 and a set of edges @xmath9 ( we allow multiple edges between two vertices ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be a collection of positive real numbers , which are called resistances . to each edge @xmath11 , one may associate two oriented edges , and we shall denote by @xmath12 the set of all these oriented edges .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be two finite , disjoint , non empty sets of vertices of @xmath15 : @xmath13 will denote the source of the network , and @xmath14 the sink . a function @xmath16 on @xmath12",
    "is called a flow from @xmath13 to @xmath14 with strength @xmath17 if it is antisymmetric , i.e @xmath18 , if it satisfies the node law at each vertex @xmath19 of @xmath20 : @xmath21 and if the `` flow in '' at @xmath13 and the `` flow out '' at @xmath14 equal @xmath17 : @xmath22 in this definition , it is assumed that all the vertices in @xmath13 are considered as a single one , as if they were linked by a wire with null resistance ( and the same is true for @xmath14 ) .",
    "the effective resistance @xmath23 may be defined in different ways , the following is the most appropriate for us : @xmath24 where the infimum is taken over all flows @xmath16 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 with strength 1 .",
    "this infimum is always attained at what is called the _ unit minimal ( or wired ) current _ ( see @xcite theorem 3.25 p.  40 ) .",
    "a current is a flow which satisfies , in addition to the node law , kirchhoff s loop law ( see @xcite p.  12 ) . in finite graphs ,",
    "currents are unique whereas in infinite graphs , there may exist more than one current .",
    "but in @xmath6 , for instance , between two finite sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 , it is known to be attained uniquely when the resistances are bounded away from 0 and infinity ( see lyons and peres @xcite p.  82 or",
    "soardi @xcite p.  39 - 43 ) .",
    "electric networks have been thoroughly studied by probabilists since there is a correspondence between electrical networks on a given graph and reversible markov chains on the same graph .",
    "let us introduce randomness on the electrical network itself by choosing the resistances independently and identically distributed .",
    "that is to say , let @xmath25 be a probability measure on @xmath26 , and equip @xmath27 with the tensor product @xmath28 .",
    "when the resistances are bounded away from 0 and @xmath29 , it is easy to see that the mean of the effective resistance is of the same order of that in the network where all resistances are equal to 1 .",
    "in fact , different realizations of this network are `` roughly equivalent '' ( see lyons and peres @xcite p.  42 ) , and for example , the associated random walks are of the same type .",
    "related results are those of berger @xcite , p.  550 and",
    "pemantle and peres @xcite , which give respectively sufficient conditions for almost sure recurrence of the network and a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure transience . in this paper , we are mainly concerned with the typical fluctuations of the function @xmath30 around its mean when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are `` far apart '' . for simplicity",
    ", we choose to focus on the variance of the effective resistance .",
    "typically , we will take @xmath13 and @xmath14 reduced to two vertices far apart : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and we shall note @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 . following the terminology used in first passage percolation ( see @xcite ) , we shall call this the _ point - to - point effective resistance _ from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .    in this paper , we prove that the type of fluctuations of the point - to - point effective resistance on @xmath6 is qualitatively different when @xmath37 and @xmath4 . indeed , when @xmath4 , we will see , quite easily , that these fluctuations are of the same order as its mean . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath38 , and the resistances are bounded away from 0 and @xmath29 , it is easy to show that the mean of @xmath39 is of order @xmath3 , where @xmath40 stands for the @xmath41-norm of the vertex @xmath1 ( see section [ sec : z2 ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following variance bound on @xmath0 when the resistances are distributed according to a bernoulli distribution bounded away from 0 .",
    "[ thmmain ] suppose that @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the set of edges in @xmath0 , and define @xmath44 .",
    "then , as @xmath1 goes to infinity : @xmath45    here as in the rest of the article , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two functions on @xmath6 , we use the notation `` @xmath48 as @xmath1 goes to infinity '' to mean there is a positive constant @xmath49 such that , for @xmath1 large enough , @xmath50 we shall also use the notation `` @xmath51 '' to mean `` @xmath48 and @xmath52 '' .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ secbernoulli ]",
    "we introduce the main tool of this paper , which is a modified poincar inequality due to falik and samorodnitsky @xcite .",
    "a first result is given in proposition [ propbkselectric ] , which announces our main result , on @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : z2 ] is devoted to the analysis of @xmath0 : we prove our main result , theorem [ thmmain ] and compare it to the simpler case of @xmath6 , for @xmath53 .",
    "the choice of the bernoulli setting has been done for the sake of simplicity , but it is possible to extend our variance bound to other distributions , and even to obtain the corresponding exponential concentration inequalities .",
    "this is developped in section [ sec : other ] . in section [ sec : leftright ] , we make some remarks and conjectures on the a priori simpler case of the left - right resitance on the @xmath54 grid .",
    "finally , section [ sec : penergy ] is devoted to an extension of theorem [ thmmain ] to the non - linear setting of @xmath5-networks .",
    "in this section , we suppose that @xmath25 is the bernoulli probability measure @xmath55 , with @xmath43 and that for each collection of resistances @xmath56 in @xmath57 , there exists a unique current flow between two finite sets of vertices of the graph @xmath15 .",
    "we want to bound from above the variance of the effective resistance .",
    "let us denote : @xmath58 a first idea is to use poincar inequality , which in this setting is equivalent to efron - stein inequality ( see e.g. steele @xcite or an et al .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the following discrete gradient : @xmath61 @xmath62 let @xmath63 be a flow attaining the minimum in the definition of @xmath33 . using the definition of the effective resistance ( [ eqdefresistance ] ) , @xmath64 for any real number @xmath65",
    ", we denote by @xmath66 the number @xmath67 , @xmath68 it is quite possible that this last bound is sharp in numerous settings of interest , including @xmath0 ( see section [ sec : z2 ] ) , but in general we do not know how to evaluate the right - hand side of inequality ( [ eqmajopoincare ] ) .",
    "we are just able to bound it from above using the fact that when @xmath16 is a unit current flow , @xmath69 for every edge @xmath11 .",
    "this last fact is intuitive , but for a formal proof , one can see lyons and peres @xcite , p.  49 - 50 . therefore @xmath70 we have shown that the variance of @xmath46 is at most of the order of its mean .",
    "it is possible to improve on this , under some suitable assumption , by using the following inequality , due to falik and samorodnitsky @xcite : @xmath71 in order to state it as a bound on the variance of @xmath46 , and to avoid repetitions , we present it in a slightly different way :    * falik and samorodnitsky . * [ lemmfs ] let @xmath46 belong to @xmath72 .",
    "suppose that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are two real numbers such that : @xmath75 @xmath76 and : @xmath77 then , @xmath78    inequality ( [ logsobfs ] ) is proved by falik and samorodnitsky only for a finite set @xmath9 , but it extends straightforwardly to a countable set @xmath9 , for functions in @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath79 now , consider the following disjunction :    @xmath80 either @xmath81 ,    @xmath80 or @xmath82 , and plugging this inequality into ( [ eqmajobeforedisj ] ) gives us : @xmath83    in any case , since @xmath84 , the second possibility is weaker than the first one , and we get : @xmath83    this inequality is very much in the spirit of an inequality by talagrand @xcite and could be called a modified poincar inequality ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for more informations on such inequalities ) .",
    "the idea to use such a type of inequalities in order to improve variance bounds is due to benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite in the context of first passage percolation . in our setting of random electric networks ,",
    "it allows us to show that as soon as the expected resistance is large but the minimal energy flow via all but few resistances is small , then the variance of the resistance is small compared to the expected resistance .",
    "this statement is reflected in the following proposition , which is an introduction to the case of @xmath0 in section [ sec : z2 ] .",
    "[ propbkselectric ] let @xmath7 be an unoriented graph with an at most countable set of vertices @xmath8 , a set of edges @xmath9 .",

    "let @xmath88 be any subset of @xmath9 such that @xmath89 is finite .",

    "we have already seen in inequality ( [ eqmajoenergy ] ) that : @xmath99 and so , define : @xmath100 where @xmath95 . besides , @xmath101 recall that when @xmath16 is a unit current flow , @xmath69 for every edge @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath102 also , using inequality ( [ eqmajodiscgrad ] ) , @xmath103 therefore , @xmath104 define @xmath105 the assumption @xmath93 ensures that @xmath106 .",
    "we conclude by applying lemma [ lemmfs ] .    unfortunately , it is not very easy to bound the terms @xmath107 and @xmath108 in an efficient way , essentially because in a random setting , we have no good bound on the amount of current through a particular edge .",
    "for example , in section [ sec : z2 ] , we will have to resort to an averaging trick , and we shall not be able to use directly proposition [ propbkselectric ] . nevertheless , for some interesting graphs such as trees , but also the lattices @xmath6 , exact calculations are available when all resistances are equal",
    ". therefore , proposition [ propbkselectric ] would become more helpful if one could prove the following stability result , which we deliberately state in an informal way .",
    "assume the flow on the fixed resistance 1 environment on a graph satisfies the condition that , except for a small set of edges , only @xmath109 flow goes via all the other edges , then is the same true for a perturbed environment ?",
    "it is natural to inspect the bernoulli setting on the most studied electrical networks , which are @xmath6 , @xmath110 . here , we focus on the point - to - point resistance between the origin and a vertex @xmath1 when @xmath1 goes to infinity ( @xmath111 when @xmath112 ) .",

    "when the resistances are bounded away from 0 and infinity , @xmath113 , and therefore its expectation , is of order @xmath137 . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ eqcompresist ] ) implies that it is of the same order as the resistance on the network where all resistances equal 1 .",

    "- 107 ) . in a more simple way",
    ", it can be easily bounded from below by using nash - williams inequality , and from above by embedding a suitable tree in @xmath0 ( see doyle and snell @xcite p. 85 , or alternatively",
    "lyons and peres @xcite p.  39",
    "a more complicated question to address is the existence of a precise limit of the ratio @xmath138 .",
    "this would lead to an analog of the `` time constant '' arising in the context of first passage percolation ( see kesten @xcite ) .",
    "closely related questions are the existence of an asymptotic shape and , if it exists , whether it is an euclidean ball or not .",
    "we believe that the time constant and the asymptotic shape exist .",
    "define @xmath139 there exists a non empty , compact subset of @xmath140 , @xmath141 such that , for every positive number @xmath142 , @xmath143    what about the order of the variance of @xmath113 , when @xmath1 goes to infinity ?",
    "reasonably , it should be of order @xmath124 .",
    "since we did not manage to prove this , we state it as a conjecture :    suppose that @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the set of edges in @xmath0 , and define @xmath44 . then , as @xmath1 tends to infinity : @xmath144    a first intuitive support to this conjecture comes from inequality ( [ eqmajopoincare ] ) .",
    "it is quite possible that it gives a bound of order @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , this would be the case if the current in the perturbed environment remained `` close '' ( for example at a @xmath146-distance of order 1 ) to the current in the uniform network ( with all resistances equal to 1 ) .",
    "a second support to this conjecture comes from the analysis of the graph @xmath147 .",
    "this one arises when one applies in a classical way the nash - williams inequality to get a lower bound on the resistance between the origin and the border of the box @xmath148 .",
    "the set of vertices @xmath149 is just @xmath150 . for @xmath151 in @xmath152 , draw @xmath153 parallel edges between @xmath151 and @xmath154 , and call them @xmath155 .",
    "this is a parallel - series electric network , and the effective resistance is easy to compute : @xmath156 one can show the following result .    [ propparser ] if the resistances on @xmath157 are independently distributed according to a symmetric bernoulli law on @xmath128 , with @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160    to shorten the notations , we treat the case @xmath161 and @xmath162 . for any @xmath56 in @xmath163 , denote @xmath164 the estimate on the mean is obvious .",
    "the estimate on the variance is easy too .",
    "first note that @xmath165 denote by @xmath166 the random variable : @xmath167 remark that : @xmath168 where @xmath169 has a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath153 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , denoting @xmath170 when @xmath151 tends to infinity , @xmath171 converges weakly to a standard gaussian variable , and : @xmath172 therefore , @xmath173 define : @xmath174 since the sequence @xmath175 is weakly convergent , it is bounded in probability .",
    "hence , using that : @xmath176 as @xmath19 goes to zero , we deduce that @xmath177 is bounded in probability , and therefore @xmath178 converges in distribution to a standard gaussian random variable . using the concentration properties of the binomial distribution , it is easy to show that @xmath178 and @xmath179 are asymptotically uniformly integrable .",
    "this implies that the variance of @xmath178 tends to 1 as @xmath151 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath180 and consequently , @xmath181    of course , on @xmath0 , things are more difficult to compute",

    "actually , wehr s result is stated for effective conductivity , that is the inverse of effective resistance , but in this context , they both are of order @xmath124 , and the lower bound of wehr implies a lower bound of the same order on the variance of the resistance .",
    "a very appealing question is therefore :    defining @xmath264 does @xmath265 converge in distribution as @xmath119 tends to infinity ?",
