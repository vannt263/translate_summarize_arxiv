    "if one looks at the formidable legacy left by the lep experiments , probably the most precious clue to unravel the mystery on the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the evidence , although not yet conclusive , in favor of a light higgs  @xcite . according to the modern understanding of field theories , combined with an intuitive naturalness criterion ,",
    "the existence of a light scalar in the low - energy spectrum , such as a light higgs boson , is a clear indication of a highly non - trivial completion of the standard model ( sm ) , with a new symmetry and new particles . or",
    ", it might be the sign of a dramatic failure of naturalness arguments  @xcite .",
    "the most notorious example of symmetry protection for the light higgs is supersymmetry : according to its paradigm , the radiative correction of each sm field to the higgs mass is fine tuned against that of a superpartner of opposite statistics .",
    "the top quark contribution , in particular , is balanced by the contribution of its scalar partners , the stops .",
    "another kind of symmetry protection , however , could be at work : the light higgs could be the pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry  @xcite . in this case",
    "the radiative correction of the top quark to the higgs mass is balanced by the contribution of new partners of the same spin .",
    "the naturalness criterium suggests that these new heavy fermions should have masses below , or not much heavier than , 1 tev .",
    "it is the production of these top partners at the lhc that we want to study in this paper .",
    "particularly motivated is the possibility that the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry and the new states originate from a strongly - coupled dynamics .",
    "this would allow for a complete resolution of the hierarchy problem without the need of fundamental scalar fields , and would make it possible to generate a large enough quartic coupling for the higgs via radiative effects .",
    "as suggested by the theoretical developments on the connection between gravity in higher - dimensional curved spacetimes and strongly - coupled gauge theories  @xcite , the strong dynamics that generates the light higgs could be realized by the bulk of an extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "these extra - dimensional theories are not only fascinating because of the profound impact they would have on our understanding of high - energy physics , but are also extremely interesting as they admit , under certain assumptions , a perturbative expansion that allows one to compute several observables of key interest , such as for example the higgs potential",
    ".    the lep precision data are once again crucial in guiding our theoretical investigation , as they seem to be compatible only with a specific kind of strong dynamics : the new sector must possess a custodial symmetry @xmath16su(2)@xmath17 to avoid large tree - level corrections to the @xmath18 parameter  @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies an unbroken su(2)@xmath19su(2)@xmath20u(1)@xmath21 invariance of the strong dynamics before ewsb , meaning that its resonances , in particular the heavy partners of the top quark , will fill multiplets of such symmetry .",
    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that possible modifications to the @xmath22 coupling can also be substantially suppressed , and the relative lep constraint more easily satisfied , if the custodial symmetry of the strong sector includes a @xmath23 parity , @xmath16su(2)@xmath24 .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath25 vertex will not receive zero - momentum corrections from the strong dynamics if @xmath26 couples linearly to a composite fermionic operator transforming as a @xmath27 under su(2)@xmath19su(2)@xmath20u(1)@xmath21 ( hypercharge being defined as @xmath28 ) . in this case , as explicitly illustrated by the 5-dimensional models built to incorporate the @xmath29 protection  @xcite , the heavy partners of @xmath30 can themselves fill a @xmath27 representation .",
    "the latter consists of two su(2)@xmath31 doublets : the first , @xmath32 , has the quantum numbers of @xmath30 ; the second  its `` custodian ''  is made of one fermion with exotic electric charge @xmath33 , @xmath2 , and one with charge @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "since the higgs transforms like a @xmath36 , the partners of @xmath37 , if any , will form a @xmath38 or a @xmath39_{2/3}$ ] of su(2)@xmath19su(2)@xmath20u(1)@xmath21  @xcite .    as explained in detail in section [ section : model ] , these new fermions are expected to couple strongly to the third generation sm quarks plus one longitudinal @xmath40 , @xmath41 gauge boson or the higgs .",
    "these interactions are responsible for both their single production in hadron collisions and their decay , while pair production will proceed via qcd interactions .",
    "the production at the lhc of the heavy fermions with electric charge @xmath42 ( the heavy tops @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath35 ) has been studied in detail in the literature , mainly because of their role in little higgs models .",
    "pair production of the su(2)@xmath31 singlet @xmath43 , @xmath45 , was considered in  @xcite , focussing on final states with one charged lepton .",
    "the process with both heavy tops decaying to @xmath46 was found to be the most promising , though channels with one neutral decay to @xmath41 or @xmath47 help increase the discovery reach as well . the minimum integrated luminosity to have a @xmath48 statistical significance , @xmath49 ,",

    "the process @xmath62 leads to spectacular events with @xmath63 s and two bottom quarks , though its observability into final states with one charged lepton or two leptons with opposite charge is challenged by the large @xmath64 sm background .",
    "to get rid of the latter , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed hard cuts on the total effective mass respectively of the jets and of the entire event . ref .",
    "@xcite also proposed the use of the single - jet invariant mass distribution as a strategy to further isolate the signal events and reconstruct the hadronically decayed @xmath4 .",
    "the basic idea is that the top and the @xmath40 originating from the decay of a very massive @xmath4 are highly boosted , and the quarks emitted in their hadronic decay will merge into a single jet with invariant mass @xmath65 close to @xmath66 or @xmath67 .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the pair production of the @xmath4 and of its custodial partner @xmath2 proposing a different strategy to get rid of the @xmath64 background : looking at final states with two _ same - sign _ leptons .",

    "we conclude with a critical discussion of our results .",
    "although the main results of our analysis will be largely independent of the specific realization of the new sector , we will adopt as a working example the `` two - site '' description of ref .",
    "@xcite , which reproduces the low - energy regime of the 5d models of  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for an alternative 4d construction ) .",
    "its two building blocks are the weakly - coupled sector of the elementary fields @xmath70 and @xmath37 , and a composite sector comprising two heavy multiplets @xmath27 , @xmath38 plus the higgs ( the case with partners of the @xmath37 in a @xmath39_{2/3}$ ] can be similarly worked out ) : @xmath71 the two sectors are linearly coupled through mass mixing terms , resulting in sm and heavy mass eigenstates that are admixtures of elementary and composite modes .",
    "the higgs doublet couples only to the composite fermions , and its yukawa interactions to the sm and heavy eigenstates arise only via their composite component .",
    "the lagrangian in the elementary / composite basis is ( we omit the higgs potential and kinetic terms and we assume , for simplicity , the same yukawa coupling for both left and right composite chiralities ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 are the masses of the composite states , @xmath75 their yukawa coupling and @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the mixing masses between elementary and composite fields . after rotating to the mass eigenstate basis ,",
    "the yukawa lagrangian reads ( now denoting with @xmath78 , @xmath37 the sm fields , and with @xmath44 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath35 , @xmath43 the heavy mass eigenstates ) : @xmath79 here the dots stand for terms with two heavy fermions , and @xmath80 denote the degree of compositeness of the sm @xmath81 quarks : @xmath82 , @xmath83  @xcite . equation ( [ eq : yuk ] ) explicitly illustrates the specific pattern expected for the couplings of the heavy fermions : they couple to one ( third - generation ) sm quark of defined chirality plus one longitudinal @xmath40 or @xmath41 boson , or the higgs .",
    "the values of the couplings are linked to the sm top yukawa coupling @xmath84 ; in the two - site model , in particular , the largest couplings are to the sm fermions with the largest composite component .",
    "for example , if @xmath85  as one naturally expects if the heavy fermions are bound states of a strongly coupled sector ",
    "the couplings of @xmath44 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , @xmath35 are large in the limit of @xmath37 mainly composite , @xmath86 , while those of @xmath43 are suppressed  @xcite . also , the small ratio between the bottom and top quark masses can be easily explained in this scheme by assuming that the @xmath87 has a very small composite component .",
    "this in turn implies that any coupling of @xmath87 to the heavy fermions will be suppressed ( for that reason we have omitted @xmath87 and its own partner(s ) from the lagrangian  ( [ eq : tslagrangian ] ) ) .",

    "<S> a natural , non - supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem generically requires fermionic partners of the top quark with masses not much heavier than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the pair production and detection at the lhc of the top partners with electric charge @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , that are predicted in models where the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson . </S>",
    "<S> the exotic @xmath2 fermion , in particular , is the distinct prediction of a lr custodial parity invariance of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector . </S>",
    "<S> both kinds of new fermions decay to @xmath5 , leading to a @xmath6 final state . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the golden channel with two same - sign leptons , and show that a discovery could come with less than @xmath7 ( less than @xmath8 ) of integrated luminosity for masses @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . in the case of the @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple strategy for its reconstruction in the fully hadronic decay chain . </S>",
    "<S> although no full mass reconstruction is possible for the @xmath4 , we still find that the same - sign dilepton channel offers the best chances of discovery compared to other previous searches that used final states with one or two opposite - sign leptons , and hence suffered from the large @xmath11 background . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also directly applies to the search of 4th generation @xmath12 quarks .    </S>",
