    "the ultraviolet - optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars is usually called the `` big blue bump '' and characterised by a smooth continuum , which is considered to be thermal emission from an accretion disk , emission lines attributed to this emission reprocessed in surrounding clumped gas in a form of broad and narrow line regions as well as in a dust obscured torus , broad absorption lines ( possessed by about 10% of quasars ) related to some streams outward quasar centre , and sets of narrow absorption lines caused by intergalactic medium . despite of general similarity in uv - optical sed of quasars",
    ", they differ in equivalent width ( ew ) of emission lines and spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "the proximity of the regions producing emission in continuum and absorption lines ( i.e. the torus and the clumped broad line region , blr ) is considered to be the most promising explanation of the @xcite effect : the inverse correlation of ew of some emission lines with the monochromatic luminosities at uv region .",
    "this effect was found , e.g. , for ly@xmath2 ( 1215   ) , siii ( 1260   ) , oi ( 1304   ) , siiv+oiv ] ( 1400   ) lines ( see e.g. @xcite ) . but the physical explanation of the difference in @xmath0 and relation of quasar luminosity and lines ew to @xmath0 are still not clear .",
    "previously , using composite spectra of quasars with different @xmath0 , we showed that there is no correlation between @xmath0 and monochromatic luminosity at 1450 , @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also have not found any dependence of ew of lines within 12101450  on spectral index @xmath0 ( calculated within the range 12701480   ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "but due to the fact , that the latter study was carried out without separation by luminosity , its result requires verification on a sample of spectra with different luminosity as well .",
    "such verification has been done in the present study .",
    "we also have checked the possible relation between the spectral index and the mass of the central black hole .",
    "we used the sample of 3535 individual quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 with medium resolution of @xmath3 , compiled by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : distr ] shows the redshift and the spectral index distribution of this sample .",
    "we selected @xmath4 subsamples with different spectral index @xmath0 ( 16 steps , from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) and monochromatic luminosity at 1450 , @xmath1 ( 12 steps , from 42.4 to 43.4 ) , and then compiled 192 composite spectra from them . here",

    "the wavelength ranges 12151285   , 12901320   , 13201350    and 13501430    were considered separately and fitted with the help of the ` idl lmfit ` subroutine with a superposition of constant ( @xmath9 ) or power - law ( @xmath10 ) continuum and the smallest possible number of gaussian - profile emission lines in the following form : @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the rest - frame wavelength , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the amplitude , the central wavelength and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ( up to @xmath16-factor ) of the @xmath17-th line . then the equivalent widths of these four separate sets of lines were calculated using obtained model parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] shows the whole wavelength range considered in the present study along with the known lines .",
    "c    the virial mass of central supermassive black hole for each of 3535 individual quasar spectra was calculated using c  iv emission line and the following empirical formula from @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are flux and luminosity , @xmath22 is the fwhm of c  iv ( 1549   ) , @xmath23 is the photometric distance .",
    "we used the following values of cosmological parameters : @xmath24 kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 from planck collaboration results ( @xcite ) , and calibration parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 for c  iv from @xcite .",
    "the obtained @xmath0ew diagrams for different luminosities are shown in figure  [ fig : res1 ] .",
    "one can clearly see dependence between these two characteristics in some cases . in all cases",
    "the significance of possible dependence was checked with the f - test using constant and linear models as restricted and unrestricted ones , respectively .",
    "the resulting coefficients of the fitted models ( the constant @xmath29 for the first case and @xmath30 , @xmath31 for the second one ) along with their errors , and the values of cumulative probability @xmath32 are presented in tables  1 , 2 .",
    "summarising the obtained results gives us the following :    \\(i ) for lines ly@xmath2+ov+nv+siii@xmath33+siii",
    "( 12151285   ) the ew decreases with @xmath0 ; the significance of the linear coefficient of regression in most cases is @xmath34 , and the baldwin effect is clearly seen for this set of lines .",
    "the more detailed analysis with separation of this region into three parts showed the same trend for ly@xmath2+ov and siii , unlike nv+siii@xmath33 for which we did not found any dependence . at the same time , the baldwin effect is seen for ly@xmath2+ov and siii lines , while for nv+siii@xmath33 we do not see any correlation between ew and luminosity , which agree with previous studies .",
    "presence of the baldwin effect was found by other authors for our first two parts together ( ly@xmath2+ov+nv+siii@xmath33 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some authors , e.g. @xcite tried to separate this set into two parts .",
    "all of them report on the baldwin effect for ly@xmath2+ov , and only @xcite claims for baldwin effect for nv+siii@xmath33 unlike two others who did not found baldwin effect for this spectral feature .",

    "the significance of the linear coefficient of regression differs for subsamples with different luminosity , moreover the values of @xmath31 differ in sign and have errors @xmath35 , thus we can not speak about some general trend .",
    "this confirms the absence of any dependence of ew on @xmath0 seen by eye .",
    "we also did not see any baldwin effect for this set of lines , although it was found by @xcite for oi line .",
    "\\(iii ) unlike the first case , for two other sets of lines , cii+ov+caii ( 12901350   ) and x1+siiv+oiv]+x2 ( 12901350   ) , we found the increase of ew with @xmath0 , but only for the second set we can clearly see the baldwin effect , found previously by other authors .",
    "on the other hand , note that the significance of the @xmath0ew dependence in most cases are @xmath34 , but in the second case for some subsamples we have negative @xmath31 values and also large errors .",

    "it is clearly seen that there is no dependence in both cases .      unlike the case of relation between the monochromatic luminosity of the quasar and the ew of its emission lines ( the baldwin effect ) , interpretation of relation between the spectral index , @xmath0 , and",
    "the ew is not so simple .",
    "firstly , one have to remember that the term ` spectral index ' describes here only a slope of some limited part of the uv - optical quasar sed ( the big blue bump ) .",
    "it has nothing common with a real power - law spectra inherent to non - thermal radiation , and serves here only as tool for some classification of quasar seds .",
    "the big blue bump is considered to be a result of thermal emission of inhomogeneous gas - dust torus , i.e. a superposition of a number of planck curves with different temperature .",
    "it has been shown previously that there is no correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xcite ) and in the present work we also show that there is no dependence between @xmath0 and the bh mass .",
    "hence we can assume that the shape of uv - optical sed of quasars does not depend , at least directly , on the central bh .",
    "it has to be influenced by the physical properties of the torus and can also be affected by the host galaxy . on the other hand , the obtained dependence between @xmath0 and ew of some emission lines , mostly for those lines for which the baldwin effect is observed , claims for some relation between the physical properties of the torus and the blr , e.g. the chemical abundance .",
