    "the overall luminosity distribution of galaxies in any environment is the traditional tool for describing the galaxy population ( see @xcite , bst ) .",
    "however , while it categorises the number - density as a function of absolute magnitude it provides no information on the morphology , structure , spectra or star - formation rates of the contributing galaxies . while studies may show that the luminosity function ( lf ) of the field , groups and rich clusters are comparable at bright magnitudes ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) , this is by no means conclusive proof that the entire galaxy population and characteristics are identical . indeed the morphology - density ( @xcite ) and the dwarf population - density @xcite relations clearly tell us that local galaxy density is important and that luminous elliptical galaxies prefer clustered environments and low luminosity irregular galaxies field environments . in short ,",
    "a single luminosity distribution may bypass exactly the information that is required to decipher the subtleties of the environmental dependency of galaxy evolution .",
    "in addition , recent measurements of the lfs in rich clusters have led to inconsistent conclusions as to whether there is a universal lf ( see for example @xcite ) or a dwarf population - density relation @xcite . in a study of 7 abell clusters @xcite , using a statistical background subtraction method , found significant variation in the faint - end slopes whereby low density clusters exhibit steeper slopes ( or higher dwarf - to - giant ratios ) . the same result was independently found for a separate sample of 35 clusters by @xcite .",
    "however , both methods rely on a statistical subtraction of the background population which , although rigorously tested in @xcite , has been criticized by @xcite as being susceptible to cosmic variance along the line of sight  although , it is difficult to understand how cosmic variance can lead to the relatively clean relation between luminosity and local density seen by @xcite and the smooth radial increase in dwarf - to - giant ratios seen in a2554 @xcite and a2218 @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite report a general trend of an increase in faint - end slope with cluster radius from @xmath8 to @xmath9 for a sample of 17 nearby clusters .",
    "for very local clusters where cluster membership can be ascertained more easily , such as virgo and coma , @xcite summarise the state - of play and argue for a universal lf ( see also review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite however argue the opposite noting the significant difference in dwarf - to - giant ratio between virgo and ursa major .",
    "some part of this confusion most likely comes about from the apparent different clustering of the two dwarf populations .",
    "for example @xcite found a generally centrally concentrated distribution of dwarf ellipticals in virgo , whereas @xcite report to the contrary a significant steepening in the luminosity function faint - end slope with cluster - centric radius , also in virgo , due to low surface brightness dwarf irregulars . in the coma cluster @xcite",
    "identify three dwarf populations ( dis , des and dsphs ) each with distinct clustering signatures .",
    "taken together , the sparse information contained within a single lf and the contradictions in the literature , it seems necessary to deconstruct the lf further , incorporating morphological / structural and/or color information in the analysis .",
    "it is also worth noting that some component of the confusion may arise from radial dependencies and the specific areal extent over which the cluster has been surveyed  particularly if the above radial trends seen in virgo are confirmed as universal . to this end",
    "we have embarked upon a detailed observational program , including space - based optical and x - ray observations , and ground - based narrow - band imaging , of the rich cluster a868 . in this paper",
    "we focus purely on the morphological aspects based upon a 12 orbit _ wide field planetary camera 2 _ mosaic of the cluster a868 .",
    "in particular we are interested in the suggestion that there may exist a universal lf for each morphological type ( bst ) and that only the relative normalisation changes with environment .",
    "analysis of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey by @xcite find that although the overall luminosity distribution is invariant between the field and cluster composite , differences do arise when subdivided according to _ spectral _ type .",
    "@xcite confirm this result based on their independent spectral study of the population in and around 6 low redshift clusters .",
    "these latter results , based on spectral classifications , generally supports the developing notion that star - formation is quenched in the infalling galaxy population ( @xcite , @xcite , see also review by @xcite ) , unfortunately spectral classifications can not address whether the population has _ physically _ changed as well .",
    "the cluster a868 itself , is unremarkable , except that it formed part of a cluster population study by @xcite , in which a high dwarf - to - giant ratio was found .",
    "the primary purpose of these hst data were to study the morphologies and structural properties of the giants and dwarfs , and in particular to identify the nature of the population responsible for the apparently steep lf upturn at the faint - end .",
    "an initial attempt in this regard , using ground - based data , was made by @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the population responsible for the faint upturn could be subdivided into three categories : a contaminating population of background high - redshift ellipticals , an overdensity ( relative to the giants ) of dwarf ellipticals , and an overdensity of dwarf irregulars .",
    "the type classification was made on the basis of color .",
    "@xcite noted that when the population of contaminating background galaxies was removed , the overall lf still showed a distinct upturn ( @xmath10 ) and a generally high overdensity of dwarf galaxies . from the colors",
    "it was concluded that the main component of this population was blue and therefore presumed to consist of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "furthermore @xcite argued that the core was devoid of dirrs which were mostly destroyed via processes such as galaxy harassment @xcite , thus accounting for the increase in the luminosity function faint - end slope from the centre outwards @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we summarise the observations , reduction and analysis of the _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ images . in section 3 we describe and validate the morphological classification process , and in section 4 we describe the appropriate error analysis incorporating the clustering signature of the background population . in section 5",
    "we show the overall and morphological luminosity distributions , determined via statistical background subtraction , and compare them to recent field estimates to test bsts hypothesis . in section 6",
    "we investigate the radial distribution in terms of the luminosity- and number- density profile of each morphological type and conclude in section 7 .",
    "we adopt @xmath11 km / s / mpc , @xmath12 and @xmath13 throughout , this results in a distance modulus to a868 of @xmath14 mags ( excluding k - correction ) .",
    "a868 formed part of a cluster population study by @xcite , in which a high dwarf - to - giant ratio was found ( see also @xcite ) . to pursue this further 12 orbits",
    "were allocated in cycle 8 with the _ wide field planetary camera 2 _ onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) to obtain a six - pointing f606w mosaic of the cluster .",
    "a868 lies at coordinates @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the cluster has an abell richness class 3 , and is of bautz - morgan type ii - iii ( see @xcite and @xcite for the earlier work on a868 ) .",
    "the data comprise 24 individual exposures of 1100s , each targeted at six individual and marginally overlapping pointings ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the data were combined using a pixel clipping algorithm based on local sky statistics developed for use with wfpc2 images in the lmorpho package @xcite .",
    "extensive tests were made comparing the photometry derived from such stacks , to those derived from the drizzle algorithm @xcite with no appreciable systematic difference found .",
    "the lmorpho stacks , produced in a more straight - forward fashion , and free of problems associated with correlated pixel noise , were adopted for further use .",
    "the final pixel scale is 0.0996 arcsec / pixel and the full mosaic field covers an area of 0.007545 sq",
    ". degrees . fig .",
    "2 shows the wfpc2 chip containing the cluster core , showing the dominant cd and d galaxies , and evidence for strong gravitational lensing .",
    "the photometric zeropoint for each mosaic was 30.443 , as taken from @xcite , placing the photometry onto the vega system .",
    "initial object source catalogs were derived with sextractor @xcite using a 2@xmath16 sky level threshold ( per pixel ) and a minimum isophotal area of 5 pixels .",
    "a gui - based image editor in the lmorpho package was used to visually inspect image segmentation over the field and edit obvious problems .",
    "image postage stamps were prepared for each detected source and the galphot package in lmorpho was used to perform automated galaxy surface photometry .",
    "this package incorporates information about nearby cataloged sources and performs modest corrections designed to decrease photometric degradation from field crowding .",
    "the lmorpho catalog for 1616 valid objects in a868 contained a variety of image structural parameters as well as total magnitudes and quartile radii ( including the effective radius )  for full details of the inner workings of this software package see @xcite .",
    "note that final magnitudes are extinction corrected using @xcite dust maps .",
    "briefly an initial isophotal magnitude within an elliptical aperture is measured and the data is corrected to total based upon the extrapolated profile fit . in most cases",
    "this provides an excellent approximation to the total magnitude and is ideal for crowded sight - lines such as a868 .",
    "however its well known that for anomalous and/or flat profile objects the isophotal correction can become unrealistically large . as a check of the isophotal corrections we show the isophotal versus total magnitudes for the full a868 galaxy population ( see fig .",
    "clearly a small fraction of objects do indeed have unrealistic isophotal corrections .",
    "we hence adopt a cap to the isophotal correction shown as the dotted line .",
    "this is a simple power - law fitted to the lower bound of the brighter data ( note that not surprisingly the cap is only required for the late - types , triangles on fig .",
    "4 , which exhibit non - standard profile shapes ) .",
    "the expression for the isophotal cap is given by : @xmath17    finally fig .",
    "4 shows the apparent bivariate brightness distribution , this highlights that stars and galaxies are well separated to @xmath18 mag , and that the bulk of the galaxy population lies above the surface brightness detection isophote to the same limit . from fig .",
    "4 it is also apparent that earlier - types are of higher effective surface brightness in line with conventional wisdom .      in order to determine the contribution to the a868 galaxy counts from the field , we performed an identical reduction and analysis on the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) , hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) and the deep field 53w002 @xcite  all observed in f606w , covering @xmath19 sq deg , and calibrated onto the same photometric system as a868 ( see @xcite for further details of these specific fields ) .",
    "however these three deep fields only provide reference counts at faint magnitudes ( @xmath20 mag ) . to provide reference counts at brighter magnitudes we adopt the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; @xcite ) and convert the mgc photometry from @xmath21 to f606w .",
    "this is achieved by convolving the _ isaac newton telescope s _ kpno @xmath22 and the _ hubble space telescope s _",
    "f606w filter+instrument transmission functions with the mean zero redshift cosmic spectrum from the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , after dividing out the equivalent flux calibrated spectrum for vega ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this resulted in a transformation of : @xmath23 .",
    "although the mgc counts extend to @xmath24 mag , the color transformation above will only be appropriate for non - cosmological distances , i.e. , @xmath25 mag .",
    "object classification for the a868 , hdfn , hdfs , 53w002 fields were performed using an artificial neural network ( ann ) , as described in @xcite . briefly , the anns were initially trained on a sample classified by eye , drawn from a variety of datasets including the hst bbpar @xcite and rc3 catalogues @xcite .",
    "the anns take as input parameters a set of structural measurements for each image ( seven isophotal areas and a seeing / psf measurement ) and output a classification onto the 16 step de vaucouleurs t - type system ( see @xcite ) with an additional step added for stars .",
    "stars are defined as t - type=12 , early - types ( e / s0 ) as @xmath26 t - type @xmath27 , mid - types ( sabc ) as @xmath28 t - type @xmath29 , and late - types ( sd / irr ) as @xmath30 t - type @xmath31 .",
    "an error is allocated to each classification based upon the dispersion amongst five independently trained anns . as a check of the classification accuracy we visually inspected all objects brighter than @xmath32 mag . in 80 out of the 663 cases",
    "a visual override was necessary .",
    "the majority of these were due to entangled isophotes ( i.e. , crowding ) which is known to cause some problems with ann classifications .",
    "table 1 sumarises the overrides and no obvious classification bias is apparent .",
    "we also note that three of these errors were the a868 central cd and two d galaxies which were all erroneously classified as sabcs .",
    "as no cd or d galaxies were included in the ann training sets , it is understandable that the giant bulge surrounded by a low surface brightness halo could readily be confused with a mid - type spiral . excluding these three specific objects ,",
    "thereby gives an unchecked ann classification accuracy of @xmath33 per cent .",
    "postage stamp images for randomly selected galaxies are shown in fig . 5 , ordered by type and apparent magnitude .    for the ground - based mgc data all galaxies brighter than @xmath34 were classified by eye ( sco ) to provide fully consistent bright magnitude reference counts .",
    "prior to field subtraction it is first worth making careful consideration of the error budget , particularly in light of concerns raised by @xcite that many of the steep faint - ends observed in clusters , are due to the clustering signature of the background field population .",
    "this has some justification as the error analysis involved when subtracting reference counts from cluster counts has often been overlooked ( for example in @xcite ) .",
    "here we intend to extend the normal analysis to now incorporate this additional error component .       in this particular analysis",
    "there are five components to the error budget : counting errors in ; the reference counts ( @xmath35 ) , the field counts in the cluster sight - line ( @xmath36 ) , and the cluster population itself ( @xmath37 ) ; along with the clustering error in the two sets of field counts ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that we separate out the two counting errors in the cluster sight - line as in reality there are two distinct superimposed populations ( field , f and cluster , c ) .",
    "for all three counting errors we adopt the usual assumption of @xmath40 statistics for the associated error ( _ i.e. , _ poisson statistics ) . for the clustering error",
    "we start from the prescription given in @xcite [ eqn .",
    "45.6 ] which provides an expression for the total variance in cell - to - cell counts for a randomly placed cell as : @xmath41 here n is defined as the counts in a given cell ( i.e. , per field - of - view , @xmath42 ) , n is the global mean count per sq degree and @xmath43 is the separation between the solid angle elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this expression",
    "the first term represents the poisson error ( @xmath16 ) and the second the clustering error ( @xmath46 ) , i.e. , @xmath47 the above simple approximation for @xmath46 uses the mean separation between points in a square of side @xmath48 @xcite and the standard expression for the angular correlation function of @xmath49 . replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( the number - counts for the specified field - of - view ) and @xmath52 with @xmath53 yields the variances from the clustering error for any field size ( @xmath42 or @xmath54 ) and magnitude interval ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "observationally we find @xcite that : @xmath56 hence by combining eqns  5 & 6 and adopting @xmath57@xmath58 we get a final approximation for @xmath46 of : @xmath59 assuming @xmath60 remains a power law out to the size of the field . here",
    "@xmath61 are the galaxy counts per 0.5 mag for the specified field of view , @xmath42 , which is given in sq degrees .",
    "the five errors identified above can now be written down explicitly as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the number - counts for the combined reference fields , the field population in the a868 sight - line and the number - counts of the cluster population respectively , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the field - of - views of the 3 individual reference fields ( 0.0011 sq deg ) and the cluster field - of - view ( 0.007545 sq deg ) respectively . where appropriate these errors , or their adaptations , are combined in quadrature and used throughout all further analysis steps .",
    "the overall and morphological galaxy number - counts for the full a868 mosaic and the combined reference fields scaled to the same area are shown on fig .  6 .",
    "note that the a868 total counts lie above the reference field counts until @xmath67 ( and for each class until @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , at which point the a868 counts drop sharply indicating the approximate completeness limit(s ) of the a868 data ( see also fig .",
    "we hereby adopt @xmath71 mag as the completeness limit ( equivalent to @xmath72 mag ) and 0.75 mag brighter than the apparent completeness limit .",
    "the reference counts , obtained from the two hubble deep fields and 53w002 , extend substantially deeper than the a868 counts but provide no available data at bright magnitudes ( @xmath73 mag ) . to circumvent this",
    "we add in the mgc bright counts after transposing from b to f606w as discussed in section 3 .",
    "to provide continuous coverage over the full magnitude range we now elect to represent the field counts by a second order polynomial fit to the combined reference field data . as well as providing continuous coverage this has the additional advantage of smoothing the reference data to remove unwanted structure from the 3 contributing fields . the field data used and the resulting fits are shown in tables 2 & 3 respectively .",
    "note that the data were only fitted over the magnitude range @xmath74 although additional data are shown in table 2 for completeness .",
    "the smoothing of the counts does not reduce the associate errors but redistributes it over the specified magnitude range .",
    "subtracting the smoothed reference field counts from the a868 counts for each population yields a direct statistical representation of the morphological luminosity distribution for the cluster ( adopting a universal sab k - correction of @xmath75 mags ) , as shown on fig .  7 and tabulated as table 4 .",
    "also shown on fig .",
    "7 ( upper left , dotted line ) is the 2dfgrs composite cluster luminosity function ( lf ) as derived by @xcite , shifted to the f606w bandpass .",
    "this gives a formally acceptable fit to the cluster .",
    "the open squares show the previous and deeper ground - based @xmath76-band data which agrees well within the errors .",
    "given that the background subtraction is derived from an entirely different region of sky to the earlier work ( see @xcite ) this provides a further indication that the steep faint - end slope seen in a868 is a robust result .",
    "of course one might argue that the a868 sight - line could be contaminated by a more distant cluster , although this would boost the faint elliptical counts / lf which is not seen .",
    "7 shows the lfs of ellipticals ( e / s0s , upper right ) , spirals ( sabcs , lower left ) and irregulars ( sd / irrs , lower right ) .",
    "morphological k - corrections of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 were calculated for the f606w filter combined with the 15gyr evolved e , sa and sc model spectra of @xcite .",
    "the formal @xmath80 error ellipses for the schechter function fits , based on the @xmath81-minimisation of the standard schechter lf , are shown as fig .",
    "the results and formal @xmath82 errors are also tabulated in table 5 . for fig .",
    "7 ( upper left , all types ) the solid line shows the sum of the three individually derived morphological lfs showing interesting structure consistent with recent reports of an upturn at fainter magnitudes ( e.g. a0963 , @xcite ) and/or a dip at intermediate mags ( e.g. coma , @xcite ) . if each morphological class has a universal lf , as has been suggested @xcite , this dip then naturally arises as the morphological mix changes ( as required by the morphology - density relation , @xcite ) .",
    "the errorbars shown in fig .  7 and the resulting error contours shown on fig .  8 include the five error components discussed in section 4 .",
    "it is worthwhile assessing which of these error components dominate the error budget .",
    "9 shows the total and individual error components involved in this analysis . from this figure",
    "we can see that the dominant error at bright magnitudes comes from the number of cluster members , whereas at faint magnitudes the dominant error typical comes from the clustering of the background population in the cluster sight - line .",
    "one interesting point to note is that a full blown spectroscopic study would fail to reach the faint magnitudes probed here , and of course be unable to improve the statistics at bright magnitudes .",
    "in fact a spectroscopic study is more likely to lead to additional uncertainty due to completeness issues .",
    "further improvement can only come from the combination of extensive deep _ imaging _ data for a large sample of combined cluster data .",
    "nevertheless it is clear from fig . 7",
    "that the steep faint - end seen in a868 is almost entirely dominated by late - types with some contribution from mid - types in general agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately while field morphological lfs exist , no comparison is sensible unless an identical morphological classification methodology has been applied .",
    "however as a general result , morphological field studies typically find @xmath83 for early - types , @xmath84 for mid - types and @xmath85 for late - types ( see for example ssrs2s morphological lfs , @xcite ; 2dfgrss spectral lfs , @xcite , @xcite ; and sdss - edrs morphological lfs , @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the recent results , from the sdss - edr , who classify 1500 galaxies onto a similar but not identical morphological system in @xmath86 . to adapt nakamura",
    "et al s numbers to provide consistent morphological lfs we added 2/3s of their sbc - sd class to their s0a - sb class and 1/3 of their sbc - sd class to their i m class and rederived the schechter function parameters .",
    "we also derive @xmath87 ( from @xcite ; @xcite ; and our estimate of @xmath88 from section 2.1 ) and adopt @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this gives the following morphological field lfs :    @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94    the location of the morphological field lfs are shown on fig .",
    "8 as solid symbols with errorbars .",
    "we see that the e / s0 , sabc and sd / irr field and cluster lfs are all consistent at the @xmath95-level ( and in qualitative agreement the field and cluster lfs of @xcite ) .",
    "clearly though the errors dominate and many clusters must be studied in a combined analysis before the universality of morphological luminosity functions can be confirmed or refuted . given the extensive sdss - edr database and the incoming acs cluster data this is likely to be established in the near future and the current results should be taken as indicative that the morphological lfs are not widely variant between cluster and field environments .",
    "we now subdivide the mosaic into five radial intervals of @xmath96 ( 130 kpc ) around the dominant cd , and calculate the contribution of each morphological class to the luminosity- and number- density within the range @xmath97 mag ( equivalent to @xmath98 mag ) . to achieve this",
    "we build a map of the mosaic to calculate the relevant active fields - of - view , within each annulus , and use the expressions given in table 3 to subtract off the appropriate field component .",
    "10 ( upper ) shows the radial dependency of the luminosity - density , @xmath99 , for each type in arbitrary units and fig .",
    "10 ( lower ) the number - density .",
    "whereas the former is skewed towards brighter systems ( which dominate the luminosity - density ) the latter is skewed towards fainter systems ( at least for mid- and late- type spirals which have rising lfs ) . from fig .",
    "10 we find a number of indicative results .",
    "first though , we note the rise in luminosity - density and number - density in the final radial bin .",
    "this is likely because of the presence of the second d galaxy which lies 0.7 mpc from the central cd and may represent an infalling sub - group . ignoring the bias introduced by this last bin we find that the luminosity - density of each class falls in a near linear fashion in log(j ) versus radius with gradients of : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , for e / s0+cd / d , sabc and sd / irr respectively . ignoring the cd / d galaxies results in a gradient of @xmath103 , for the e / s0s alone (",
    "i.e. , consistent with the mid - type population ) .",
    "this is of course an independent confirmation of the well known morphology - density relation @xcite .",
    "note that the exclusion of the cd / ds has little impact upon the derived schechter function for early - types , ( c.f .",
    "dashed line on fig .",
    "8 , middle , e / s0s , see also table 5 ) .",
    "similarly the number - densities also fall near linearly in log(n ) versus radius with a significant variation in gradient depending on type ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , for e / s0+cd / ds , sabcs and sd / irrs respectively ) is roughly equivalent to a real profile of @xmath107 , hence the positive projected profile for sd / irrs still implies a decreasing 3d radial profile . ] .    from fig .",
    "10 two clear conclusions can be drawn .",
    "firstly the classical result that early - type galaxies are more centrally concentrated in number than mid - type spirals which in turn are more centrally concentrated than late - type irregulars .",
    "secondly the flat number - density profile of late - types implies that the core must be devoid of late - types which therefore exist exclusively in the cluster halo , independently confirming the result of @xcite .",
    "this halo extends beyond the field - of - view studied here but from the luminosity - density profile it is unlikely to contribute significantly to the total luminosity - density at any radii . within the field - of - view",
    "studied we note that the total luminosity - density , within all annuli , is divided into ( @xmath108 ) per cent e / s0+cd / ds , ( @xmath109 ) per cent sabcs , and ( @xmath110 ) per cent sd / irrs .",
    "this can be compared to those derived from the sdss - edr field lfs shown above ( where @xmath111 ) of 29 per cent , 59 per cent , and 12 per cent for early- , mid- , and late- types respectively . neglecting the cd / ds changes the cluster percentages to 63 per cent , 34 per cent and 3 per cent respectively ( with similar errors ) .    as a comparison we note that values of 33 per cent , 53 per cent , and 14 per cent for the field were derived by @xcite for a volume limited sample at @xmath112 drawn from the hubble deep field and classified using the same ann classifiers as used here .",
    "the consensus between these two independent field studies is reassuring and provides some indication of the associated errors . if one assumes that both the field and cluster environments originate from an identical shape primordial mass spectrum but with differing amplitudes , this discrepancy _ must _ be due to an additional / accelerated evolutionary mechanism(s ) over those at work in the field . from this data alone",
    "one can not argue factually for the exact nature of this mechanism other than it has the _ net _ effect of converting later types towards earlier types , and is most efficient in the cluster core .",
    "in fact if one crudely adopts conservation of luminosity ( strictly more valid at longer wavelengths ) then up to 50 per cent of the ellipticals must have been formed from mid- or late- type spirals .",
    "this requires some contrivance given the apparent universality of the morphological lfs between the field and a868 environment although far more data for both field and clusters are required before any real significance can be attached to the difference seen , as well as a more fully consistent classification scheme .    in general",
    "the results here are consistent with the conventional picture whereby the core environment is hostile to disks and converts mid - types to early - types  which remain captured in the core  and destroys late - types entirely as they transit through the core .",
    "we report the first reconstruction of morphological luminosity functions for a cluster environment since the founding work of bst . through the method of background subtraction we recover the overall lf seen for a868 in a previous ground - based study , but which used an entirely different region of sky for the background subtraction",
    ", this adds credence to the methodology of background subtraction for this very rich cluster at least . in our analysis",
    "we lay down a methodology for accounting for background clustering bias missing in previous analysis of this type and addressing concerns raised by @xcite .",
    "the overall cluster lf is comparable to the general field lf ( 2dfgrs ) and we find that the early- , mid- and late- type lfs are all consistent with the field lfs .",
    "however the errors are such that one can not yet argue convincingly for , or against , ubiquitous morphological lfs as proposed by bst .    in exploring the luminosity- and number- density radial profiles we find flat profiles for late - types and argue that this implies an absence of late - type galaxies in the core region .",
    "furthermore we find a significantly skewed luminosity - density breakdown towards early - types , as compared to the field .",
    "we _ speculate _ that this implies that cluster cores are in essence disk - destroying engines resulting in the build up of a hot inter - cluster member and the formation of a tightly bound population of intermediate - luminosity core ellipticals most likely formed from mid - type bulges .",
    "finally from our error analysis we note that more definitive results can only be obtained from the combination of cluster data , as the dominant error at bright magnitudes is simply the number of cluster members .",
    "such data is is now becoming freely available via the _ sloan digital sky survey _ and the _ hubble space telescope _ archives . in this paper",
    "we have laid down a rigorous methodology for the analysis of such data and look forward to an illuminating era .",

    "<S> we also examine the luminosity - density and number - density profiles as a function of morphology and draw the following conclusions : ( 1 ) the galaxies responsible for the steep faint - end slope are predominantly of late - type morphology , ( 2 ) the cluster core is dominated by elliptical galaxies , ( 3 ) the core is devoid of late - types systems , ( 4 ) the luminosity - density as a function of morphological type is skewed towards early - types when compared to the field , ( 5 ) up to half of the elliptical galaxies may have formed from the spiral population through core disk - destruction process(es ) .       </S>",
    "<S> we believe the most plausible explanation is the conventional one that late - types are destroyed during transit through the cluster core and that mid - types are converted into early - types through a similar process , which destroys the outer disk and results in a more tightly bound population of core ellipticals . </S>"
