    "the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ swift _ observatory @xcite , is designed to rapidly follow - up gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows in the @xmath7 range .",
    "uvot observations of grb afterglows were first cataloged by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper1 ) and includes 229 bursts discovered between 2005 january 17 and 2007 june 16 .",
    "these bursts were primarily discovered by _",
    "swift _ but also include grbs discovered by the _",
    "high energy transient explorer  2 _ ( hete2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( integral ) , and interplanetary network ( ipn ; * ? ?",
    "* ) . in paper1 ,",
    "positional , temporal , and photometric information is provided for each grb afterglow , as well as filter - dependent light curves which are fit with a single power - law .    in this paper",
    "we describe the second _ swift _ uvot grb afterglow catalog and corresponding databases , which contain information on bursts observed during the first six years of uvot operations ( 2005 - 2010 ) .",
    "this catalog more than doubles the number of observed grbs and also includes uvot observations of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero _",
    "( agile ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) discovered grbs .",
    "the catalog and databases include much of the same type of information provided in paper1 but also include important additions : data is optimally co - added ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m08 ) to increase the number of detections , optimally co - added data is normalized to a given bandpass , and normalized data are fit with single and broken power - laws . additionally , redshift and extinction corrected spectral slopes and filter dependent temporal slopes are provided .",
    "in section  [ sec : obs ] we present the observations made by the uvot . in section  [ sec : construct ] we describe the construction of the image / event and normalized optimally co - added databases and the resulting grb catalog . in section  [ sec : format ]",
    "we describe the databases and catalog . in section  [ sec : sum ] we provide a summary of the catalog and in section  [ sec : concl ] discuss future work .",
    "the databases and catalogs are provided in electronic format as part of this paper and are also available at the barbara a. mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) and _ swift _ websites .",
    "the uvot utilizes seven broadband filters during the observation of grbs : uvw2 ( @xmath8 ) , uvm2 ( @xmath9 ) , uvw1 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and a clear - filter @xcite .",
    "data in each filter are collected in either image or event mode . in image mode ,",
    "individual photons are collected , aspect corrected , and added to an onboard image buffer . at the conclusion of an exposure",
    ", images are packaged and sent to the spacecraft awaiting transfer to the ground . in event mode ,",
    "individual photons are collected , time tagged , and sent to the ground where they are converted to event lists and aspect corrected sky images .",
    "the event data is used to create high time resolution ( @xmath17 ) photometry of bright bursts while image data is used for fainter sources .",
    "a more complete description of the filters , image acquisition , and observing sequences can be found in paper1 .",
    "this catalog includes 626 bursts first detected by the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hete2 , integral , ipn , lat , and agile during the period from 2005 jan 17 to 2010 dec 25 .",
    "a total of 538 of the 626 bursts were observed ( but not necessarily detected ) by the uvot representing 86% of the cataloged bursts .",
    "bursts detected by bat but not observed by uvot were either too close in angular distance to a bright ( @xmath18 ) source ( including the sun and moon ) , or occurred during uvot engineering operations .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the notation @xmath19 for the afterglow flux density as a function of time , where @xmath20 is the frequency of the observed flux density , @xmath21 is the time post trigger , @xmath22 is the spectral index which is related to the photon index @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 is the temporal decay slope .",
    "to provide context for understanding the work described herein , we define the following : image pipeline , event pipeline , databases , and catalog . the image pipeline is an idl - based program that incorporates the uvot tool , uvotsource , and is used to perform photometry on level-1 images .",
    "the event pipeline is a collection of tools used to perform fine aspect corrections on uvot event data and photometric measurements on the resulting event lists ; photometry is performed with uvotevtlc .",
    "the event pipeline software is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the databases are a repository for all photometric measurements made by the photometry pipeline .",
    "there are two databases : the image / event database that is the result of processing the raw uvot data , and the normalized optimally co - added ( noc ) database that is the final product used to produce the noc light curves .",
    "the catalog is a compilation of the top - level data derived from the image / event and noc databases , and other sources such as the bat catalog @xcite , the _ swift _ grb archive ( sga ) , and the gamma - ray burst coordinate network circulars . as such",
    ", this catalog provides the primary characteristics for each burst .",
    "the image / event database was constructed using the image and event pipelines which are essentially the same as those described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of paper1 .",
    "differences are noted below .    to ensure that all images and exposure maps benefited from consistent and up - to - date calibrations , the _ swift _ data center ( sdc ) reprocessed images taken before grb  070621 .",
    "this reprocessing was necessary due to the fact that earlier versions of the processing pipeline did not take advantage of essential lessons learned from the first years of operations .",
    "images for subsequent bursts were taken directly from the _ swift _ archive .",
    "the ftool uvotskycorr was manually run on a small number of archive images to improve the aspect solution . in paper1",
    ", we reported the position of potentially contaminating sources .",
    "this has been dropped from the current version of the database since its primary purpose is already accounted for in a quality flag .    for event lists , all available event data ( including settling exposures ) from the first observation segment , which can span more than one orbit ,",
    "was extracted ; in paper1 , we only considered event data taken in the @xmath15- and @xmath1-filters in the first orbit .",
    "we note that for the earliest settling exposures ( @xmath26 ) the cathode is still warming up , therefore these exposures can produce erroneous values .",
    "all settling exposures in these databases are marked with a quality flag .",
    "both image and event pipelines utilized headas version 6.10 and the 2011 january 31 uvot caldb . in paper1",
    ", we provided only @xmath27 radius apertures that were used for aperture photometry . in this version",
    "we provide both @xmath27 and @xmath28 radius photometry apertures in the image and event pipelines .",
    "upper limits were reported for sources @xmath29 .",
    "here we use @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 ( as in paper1 ) since the position of the burst is often known to the arcsecond - level .    to determine the fraction of false positives ( @xmath32 ) we use equation  [ q - func ] , where @xmath33 is the number of non - detections ( @xmath34 ) in the catalog ( 98,601 and 98,689 for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 databases , respectively ) ,",
    "@xmath35 is the q - function at two standard deviations , and @xmath36 is the number of observations ( 119,598 and 120,217 ) . @xmath37 we conservatively estimate that the fraction of false positives is 1.92% and 1.91% for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 databases , respectively .",
    "the noc database was created through a five step process : initial optimal co - addition of the data , preliminary fits to the light curves , rerunning of the optimal co - addition , refitting of the light curves , and normalization of the color light curves to a single filter .",
    "optimal co - addition is one of the fundamental differences between this work and that presented in paper1 .",
    "the first step was to perform optimal co - addition on each burst in the @xmath28 image / event database for each filter .",
    "optimal co - addition uses the @xmath25 of a grb to  optimally weight each exposure during image summation to maximize the signal - to - noise of the final co - added image \" ( m08 ) .",
    "this initial step recovers a greater number of individual detections in each filter with which to generate light curves .",
    "our method differs slightly from the one provided by the ftool uvotoptsum since uvotoptsum is optimized for individual detections whereas our code is optimized for producing detailed light curves .",
    "m08 have shown that using an @xmath25 within @xmath38 of the actual grb @xmath25 during optimal co - addition provides for a more significant detection than an unweighted co - addition technique ; therefore , during the initial optimal co - addition process , we used a  canonical \" @xmath25 of 0.88 , an average decay value determined from a sample of light curves for @xmath39 after the trigger @xcite . from the optimally co - added data we produced detailed light curves for each burst in each filter .",
    "we then fit each segment , or data points between break times , of the light curve with a single power law varying the temporal slope each time .",
    "our fitting routine is centered around the idl - based program mpfit @xcite . for each @xmath25 ,",
    "a model fit is produced , compared to the data , and an overall @xmath40 for the entire light curve is calculated . for purposes of this catalog , we assume that the cooling frequency ( @xmath41 ) has not , or has already , passed through the uvot bandpass for all bursts .",
    "confirmation of this assumption will be provided in a forthcoming publication .",
    "based on this assumption , for each segment of the burst and a given @xmath25 , the average @xmath40 for all filters is calculated .",
    "the @xmath25 with an average @xmath40 that most closely approaches unity is the temporal slope used for the given segment in the remaining steps .    with newly determined temporal slopes for each burst ,",
    "optimal co - addition was rerun on each burst in the image / event database .",
    "the newly produced light curves were then refitted as described previously ( e.g. figure  [ fig-8up ] ) .",
    "all color light curves for each burst were then normalized to a given band ( typically @xmath15-band ) and then fit with a single , broken , or multiply - broken power law ( e.g. figure  [ fig-8up ] ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "as in paper1 , we compare a sample of the resultant light curves with those published in the literature to check for consistency : grbs 050525a @xcite , 050603 @xcite , 050730 @xcite , 050801 @xcite , 050802 @xcite , 060124 @xcite , 060313 @xcite , 060729 @xcite , 061007 @xcite , 070125 @xcite , 080319b @xcite , 080810 @xcite , 081008 @xcite , 081203a @xcite , 090426 @xcite , 090510 @xcite , and 090902b @xcite . for each of these bursts ,",
    "we look for at least three events with comparable exposure times at similar epochs while keeping the normalized and published filters the same whenever possible .",
    "based on these criteria , we compare the magnitudes , fluxes , or count rates to determine if they are consistent with each other , within the errors .",
    "we note that some values are visually extracted from the literature for comparison as there are no tabular values available .",
    "our resultant light curves are found to be consistent with the published values .",
    "the uvot grb catalog was constructed by combining information from various databases and catalogs .",
    "the filter , magnitude , and flux of the first and peak detections , along with the start times of these events , were taken from the image / event database for each burst .",
    "temporal slopes in each filter for each burst were derived from the noc light curves . from these temporal slopes ,",
    "dust extinction and redshift corrected fluxes in each filter were computed at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and spectral slopes were determined .",
    "these times were chosen so as to be after the period of greatest afterglow variation ( @xmath45 ; * ? ? ? * ) and to span two decades in time .",
    "details of the spectral slope fitting are provided in table  [ catdd]-column 332 .",

    "<S> we present the second _ swift _ ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ) gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow catalog , greatly expanding on the first _ swift _ uvot grb afterglow catalog . </S>",
    "<S> the second catalog is constructed from a database containing over @xmath0 independent uvot observations of 538 grbs first detected by _ </S>",
    "<S> swift _ , the _ high energy transient explorer  2 _ ( hete2 ) , the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( integral ) , the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , _ fermi _ , and _ astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero _ ( agile ) . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog covers grbs discovered from 2005 jan 17 to 2010 dec 25 . </S>",
    "<S> using photometric information in three uv bands , three optical bands , and a ` @xmath1 ' or open filter , the data are optimally co - added to maximize the number of detections and normalized to one band to provide a detailed light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog provides positional , temporal , and photometric information for each burst , as well as _ swift </S>",
    "<S> _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) grb parameters . </S>",
    "<S> temporal slopes are provided for each uvot filter . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal slope per filter of almost half the grbs are fit with a single power - law , but one to three breaks are required in the remaining bursts . </S>",
    "<S> morphological comparisons with the x - ray reveal that @xmath2 of the uvot light curves are similar to one of the four morphologies identified by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath3 have a newly identified morphology . </S>",
    "<S> for many bursts , redshift and extinction corrected uv / optical spectral slopes are also provided at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 seconds . </S>"
