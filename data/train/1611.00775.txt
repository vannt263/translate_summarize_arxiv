    "since its proposal as a means to detect compact dark objects in the halo of the galaxy @xcite , microlensing has been applied to various fields of astronomy including planetary science @xcite .",
    "although the number of planets detected by the microlensing method is far less than that of planets detected by other major methods such as the radial velocity and transit methods , microlensing provides a unique tool to find planets that are difficult to detect by other methods , such as planets around faint and dark objects , planets at or beyond the snow line , and planets not gravitationally bound to their host stars ( see a detailed review by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is complementary to other methods , enabling the comprehensive study of extrasolar planets .",
    "the microlensing signal of a planet is almost always a short - term perturbation on the standard lensing light curve caused by the host of the planet .",
    "the signal is usually produced by the passage of the source star close to or over a caustic , which are the locations on the source plane at which the magnification of a point source would be infinite @xcite .",
    "the shape , size , and number of caustics vary depending on the separation and the mass ratio between the planet and the host . as a result , planetary perturbations take various forms depending on the characteristics of the planetary system as well as the source trajectory .",
    "interpretation of the planetary microlensing signal and the characterization of the planetary system require detailed analyses of the signal in the observed light curve .",
    "however , accurate interpretation of the signal is often hampered by various scenarios that can mimic the planetary signals .",
    "for example , the signals induced from two different binary - lens systems can be similar despite the great difference between their underlying physical characteristics .",
    "this degeneracy was presented by @xcite and @xcite , where they showed that short - term anomalies of a subset of lensing light curves could be explained equally well by either a binary lens with roughly equal mass components or a binary with a very large mass ratio ( i.e. , planetary system ) . in addition , @xcite showed that microlensing of star spots can give rise to light - curve deviations that very strongly mimic planetary anomalies .",
    "furthermore , the binarity of the source star rather than the lens also can masquerade as planetary signals .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if a source is a binary star with a large flux ratio between the components and a single lens passes close to both members of the binary source , the light curve can appear to be a normal single - lens curve superposed by a short - term perturbation , which is similar to that of a planetary event .",
    "@xcite showed that this degeneracy could be severe by presenting the light curve of an actually observed event .    in this paper , we present the analysis of ogle-2016-blg-0733 , which displayed a new and unexpected form of the binary - source degeneracy : the light curve of the event shows a long - term asymmetric perturbation that appears to be due to a planet , but which is actually due to a binary source . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observation of the event , and the light curve modeling is presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the implications of the results .",
    "the microlensing event ogle-2016-blg-0733 occurred on a star located toward the galactic bulge with the equatorial coordinates @xmath0 , which corresponds to the galactic coordinates @xmath1 .",

    "in addition to the ogle and the moa surveys , the event was also in the footprint of the korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "the kmtnet survey utilizes three identical 1.6 m telescopes that are located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile ( kmtnet ctio ) , south african astronomical observatory in south africa ( kmtnet saao ) , and siding spring observatory in australia ( kmtnet sso ) .",

    "the event lay in one such pair of fields ( blg02 and blg42 ) and thus the cadence of the event reached up to @xmath5 . combining this feature with its globally distributed telescopes ,",
    "the kmtnet survey densely and continuously covered the event .",
    "photometry data used for the analysis were processed using the customized pipelines that are developed by the individual survey groups : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the ogle , moa , and kmtnet groups , respectively .",
    "these pipelines are based on the difference imaging analysis method ( dia : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    for the case of kmtnet",

    "as presented in figure  [ fig : one ] , the light curve of ogle-2016-blg-0733 shows deviations from the smooth and symmetric form of an event produced by a single - mass lens .",
    "the deviations appear in two regions , one strong anomaly near the peak of the light curve at @xmath31 and the other weak but long - term anomaly in the falling side of the light curve .",

    "we adopt the center of mass of the binary - lens .",
    "another two parameters describe the binary lens , including the projected binary separation @xmath24 ( normalized to the angular einstein radius of the lens system , @xmath34 ) and the mass ratio @xmath25 @xmath35 between the binary - lens components .",

    "this parameter is needed to describe the part of the lensing light curve affected by finite - source effects .",
    "( see the appendix of @xcite for graphical presentation of the parameters . )",
    "modeling the light curve based on the binary - lens interpretation is carried out in multiple steps .",
    "first , we conduct a preliminary grid search for the lensing parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 using the map - making method @xcite . in this process , the other lensing parameters are searched for by using a downhill approach .",
    "we set @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 as grid parameters because the binary - lensing magnification varies sensitively to the change of these parameters , while the magnification varies smoothly to the changes of the other parameters . from the @xmath13 map in the grid - parameter space obtained from this initial search ,",
    "we then identify local minima . in the second stage , we refine each of the local minima by first refining the grid space and second by allowing all lensing parameters to vary . in the final stage ,",
    "we compare the goodness of the identified local minima and find a global solution .",
    "deviations in binary - lensing light curves are mostly caused by either caustic approaches or crossings during which lensing magnifications are affected by finite - source effects .",
    "we account for the finite - source effect in computing finite - source magnifications using the inverse ray - shooting method @xcite in the immediate neighboring region around caustics and using the semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite in the outer region surrounding caustics . in computing finite - source magnifications",
    ", we additionally consider the surface - brightness variation of the source star caused by limb darkening @xcite by modeling the surface brightness profile as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the limb - darkening coefficient and @xmath39 is the angle between the normal to the surface of the source and the line of sight toward the source . from the de - reddened color",
    ", it is found that the source is a g - type main - sequence star .",
    "see section 3.3 for the details of the source color measurement . based on the source type , we adopt the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath40 from @xcite . for the moa data , which are obtained from a non - standard filter system ,",
    "we use @xmath41 .    in table",
    "[ table : one ] , we present the best - fit lensing parameters of the binary - lens solutions along with the @xmath13 values per degree of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "we find that the best - fit binary - lens model has two masses with a projected separation @xmath42 and a mass ratio @xmath43 , which would make the companion a planetary - mass object projected near the einstein radius of its host .",
    "the lens system induces two sets of caustics , where one ( central caustic ) is located close to the host and the other ( planetary caustic ) is located away from the host between the planet and the host . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the model light curve of the binary - lens solution in the region of anomaly .",
    "also presented is the geometry of the lens system where the source trajectory with respect to the lens components ( concave closed curves ) is illustrated by a straight line with arrow head .",
    "we note that the source trajectory in the upper panel is aligned so that the data points marked on the trajectory match those on the light curve in the lower panel .",
    "the fit in figure  [ fig : one ] appears quite good . in particular , within the context of binary - lens models , the asymmetric peak by itself unambiguously indicates a low - mass companion aligned along the source trajectory , and it therefore unambiguously predicts an additional post - peak perturbation due to a planetary caustic .",
    "such predictions were actually made in real time , just after the peak of the event and were seemingly confirmed by the late time `` planetary '' deviations .",
    "moreover , there were at this time no known alternative class of physical effects that could induce a complex `` planetary '' light curve deviation of this type .",
    "however , there were two important clues that this solution was not in fact correct . at first sight",
    "these appear to be independent , but are actually closely related .",
    "the first is that the normalized source size is very large @xmath44 considering that the source is a dwarf .",
    "this would lead to a very small einstein radius @xmath45mas and very small lens - source relative proper motion @xmath46 .",
    "these values are a priori unlikely , although not impossible : they could be generated by a very slow lens lying a distance @xmath47 in front of the source .",
    "what raises this suspiciously large @xmath48 to the level of implausibility is that it appears to be `` driven '' by the need to match basically smooth data to an intrinsically `` bumpy '' model .",
    "because the source crossing time @xmath49hr is similar to the duration of an observing night , it is appropriate to bin these data by observatory and by day .",
    "figure  [ fig : two ] compares these binned data to the best - fit model and also to the same model but with a more typical value of @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that the data are much smoother than the model for a typical @xmath48 and are still considerably smoother than the model for the best - fit @xmath48 .",
    "we therefore were led to consider what other physical effects might generate this `` planetary '' anomaly .",
    "we consider the possibility that the long - term deviation may be caused by a single - lens event with a binary source ( binary - source event ) .",
    "the lensing magnification of a binary - source event corresponds to the flux - weighted mean of the magnifications of the two single - source events generated by the individual source stars @xcite , i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the lensing magnification of each source star with a flux @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the flux ratio between the two source stars .",
    "the single - source magnification is related to the lens - source separation normalized to the angular einstein radius , @xmath55 , by @xmath56^{1/2 } , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the moment of the closest lens approach to each source star , @xmath58 denotes the lens - source separation at that moment , and @xmath23 is the time required for the source to cross the angular einstein radius ( einstein time scale ) .",
    "therefore , one needs 6 principal parameters @xmath59 for the description of a binary - source event .",
    "since the flux ratio varies depending on the passband , one must add additional flux ratio parameters for each of the observed passbands .",
    "we search for the solution of the binary - source parameters by a downhill approach .",
    "the initial values of the parameters are set based on the peak time , magnification , and duration of the event . for the @xmath13 minimization of the downhill approach",
    ", we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we find that the binary - source model is a good fit to the observed light curve . in table  [",
    "table : one ] , we list the best - fit parameters of the binary - source solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : three ] , we present the geometry of the relative lens - source motion ( upper panel ) and the model light curve ( lower panel ) of the binary - source solution . in the upper panel ,",
    "the two lines with arrows represent the trajectories of the two source stars with respect to the lens ( marked by `` @xmath60 '' ) .",
    "we designate the source passing closer to the lens as the `` primary '' source and the other source as the `` secondary '' source .",
    "we find that the flux ratio ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) is greater than unity , indicating that the source approaching closer to the lens is fainter than the source approaching farther from the lens .",
    "while binary - lens light curves are almost perfectly achromatic ( after subtraction of the blended light ) , binary - source event light curves can be chromatic , implying that the magnification varies depending on the observed passband , and thus we present two model light curves corresponding to @xmath63 band ( moa ) and @xmath64 band ( the other groups ) data sets . according to the binary - source interpretation ,",
    "the anomaly near the peak of the light curve was produced when the faint source star approached close to the lens and the anomaly in the declining wing was produced when the brighter source approached .    by comparing the binary - lens and binary - source interpretations , we find that the binary - source model better explains the observed light curve .",
    "the binary - source model improves the fit by @xmath65 compared to the binary - lens model . in figure",
    "[ fig : four ] , we present the cumulative distribution of @xmath66 of the binary - source model with respect to the binary - lens model as a function of time .",
    "this shows that the improvements occurs during the strong anomaly near the peak and the declining part of the light curve after the peak .",
    "we find that the major improvement comes from kmtnet data which densely and continuously cover the anomaly throughout the event .",
    "the fit improvement from kmtnet data is @xmath67 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fit improvement from ogle and moa data , whose coverage of the anomaly is sparse and incomplete , are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of the high - cadence observation for the unambiguous characterization of the lensing event .      knowing that ogle-2016-blg-0733 is better explained by the binary - source interpretation",
    ", we characterize the individual source stars by estimating the source type based on the de - reddened color @xmath70 and brightness @xmath71 . for this",

    ", we first estimate the offsets in color @xmath73 and magnitude @xmath74 of individual sources with respect to the centroid of giant clump ( gc ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : five ] shows the instrumental cmd of one of four kmtnet fields ( ctio blg02 ) where the locations of individual sources and gc are shown . under the assumption that the source and gc suffer the same extinction combined with the known de - reddened color and magnitude of gc ,",
    "@xmath75  @xcite , we then estimate the de - reddened color and magnitude of the individual sources . by applying this procedure to each kmtnet field , we find that the mean de - reddened color and magnitude of the individual sources are @xmath76 for the primary and @xmath77 for the secondary .",
    "these correspond to a late and an early g - type main - sequence star for the primary and the secondary , respectively .",
    "note that we also characterize the source star based on the binary - lens interpretation solely for the purpose of incorporating the limb - darkening coefficients into the binary - lens model . by following the same procedure , we determine the mean de - reddened color and magnitude of the source as @xmath78 corresponding to a g - type main - sequence star .",

    "<S> the result also signifies the importance of considering various interpretations of planet - like perturbations and of high - cadence observation not only for resolving the degeneracy but also for ensuring the unambiguous detection of the planet . </S>"
