    "about 23 @xmath4 energy density of the present universe is made up of dark matter and it plays a key role in the large structure formation .",
    "however , we do nt know what it is .",
    "dark matter candidates do nt exist in the standard model ( sm ) .    weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )",
    "is one of the most plausible candidate for dark matter .",
    "it is neutral , massive , and sufficiently stable particle and such particle naturally explains the observed dark matter abundance , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "many models of physics beyond the sm including wimp dark matter have been proposed .",
    "the tev physics could be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the lhc is now operating , but the precision measurement of events including dark matter in final state is difficult at the experiments . on the other hand , it would be possible at the ilc .",
    "the measurements is important for not only dark matter physics but also identification of the tev new physics model .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the possibility of general wimp search and new physics model identification studying @xmath3 process at the ilc , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the wimp and the charged new particle , respectively . using the process ,",
    "we have already studied about the possibility of precision measurements of the little higgs model @xcite .",
    "we have shown that we can extract fruitful information from the signal of the process : the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath6 can be determined from the edges of the energy distribution of the reconstructed @xmath7 bosons .",
    "it is also possible to confirm that the spin of @xmath1 and the vertex structure using the angular distribution of the @xmath1 pair procudion and the polarization of @xmath8 .",
    "the gauge charges of the @xmath1 boson could be measured using a polarized electron beam .",
    "it is worth noting that such process exists in many tev physics models which explain the smallness of electroweak scale , because wimp candidates would interact with the sm particles weakly .",
    "thus , the process plays a key role of the general wimp search .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in our study , both signal and background events have been generated by physsim @xcite .",
    "the initial - state radiation and beamstrahlung have been included in the event generations .",
    "we have ignored the finite crossing angle between the electron and positron beams . in the event generations , helicity amplitudes were calculated using the helas library @xcite , which allows us to deal with the effect of gauge boson polarizations properly .",
    "phase space integration and the generation of parton 4-momenta have been performed by bases / spring @xcite .",
    "parton showering and hadronization have been carried out by using pythia6.4 @xcite , where final - state tau leptons are decayed by tauola @xcite in order to handle their polarizations correctly .",
    "the generated monte carlo events have been passed to a detector simulator called jsfquicksimulator , which implements the gld geometry and other detector - performance related parameters @xcite . in the detector simulator , hits by charged particles at the vertex detector and track parameters at the central tracker are smeared according to their position resolutions , taking into account correlations due to off - diagonal elements in the error matrix .",
    "since calorimeter signals are simulated in individual segments , a realistic simulation of cluster overlapping is possible .",
    "track - cluster matching is performed for the hit clusters in the calorimeter in order to achieve the best energy flow measurements .",
    "the resultant detector performance in our simulation study is summarized in table [ tb : gld ] .",
    "we use events in which both @xmath7 bosons decay hadronically , @xmath9 , as signal events .",
    "thus , the main background processes are @xmath10,@xmath11 , etc .    in order to identify the two @xmath7 bosons from @xmath1",
    "decays , two jet - pairs have been selected so as to minimize a @xmath12 function , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the invariant mass of the first ( second ) 2-jet system paired as a @xmath7 candidate , @xmath15 is the true @xmath7 mass ( 80.4 gev ) , and @xmath16 is the resolution for the @xmath7 mass ( 4 gev ) .",
    "we required @xmath17 to obtain well - reconstructed events .    since @xmath18 escape from detection resulting in a missing momentum , we have thus selected events with the missing transverse momentum @xmath19  above 84 gev . we have also selected events with a energy of @xmath7 below 500 gev .",
    "the number of remaining background events is much smaller than that of the signal after imposing all the cuts .",
    "the masses of new particles , @xmath18 and @xmath1 , can be determined from the edges of the @xmath7 energy distribution . after subtracting the backgrounds ,",
    "the distribution has been fitted with a line shape determined by a high statistics signal sample .",
    "the fitted masses of @xmath18 and @xmath1 are summarized in table [ tb : reso_1tev ] .",
    "the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath18 will be determined with @xmath20% accuracy .",
    "the production angle of @xmath1 can be calculated with 2-fold ambiguity from the momenta of @xmath7 bosons , assuming back - to - back production of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : angle ]     production angle at each models.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( ih ) +     production angle at each models.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( susy ) +     production angle at each models.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( lh ) +    shows 2-dimensional histogram . to estimate the possibility of the new physics model identification",
    ", we compare the distribution with the `` template '' which is the distribution of high statistics signal samples using @xmath23 analysis : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the number of the data and the number of the template at each bin , respectively .",
    "the @xmath27 is the error of the signal and backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath23 values are summarized in table [ tb : chi2_1tev ] .",
    "it shows that the identification of these new physics models is possible by comparing of production angles of @xmath1 .",
    "we study the possibility of general wimp search and new physics model identification using @xmath3 process at the @xmath28 tev ilc with integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath29 .",
    "we have shown that the masses of new particles can be determined very accurately at the ilc in a model independent way . furthermore , using @xmath12 analysis , the identification of new physics models is possible by comparing of the @xmath1 production angles .",
    "finally , we have also studied the threshold scan to separate the new physics model .",
    "it shows that the susy like case will be separate from other models .",
    "the authors would like to thank all members of the ilc physics subgroup @xcite for useful discussions .",
