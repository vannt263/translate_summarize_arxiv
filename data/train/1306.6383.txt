    "observations of the dynamics of galaxies as well as the dynamics of the whole universe reveal that a main part of the universe s mass must be missing or , in modern terminology , this missing mass is made of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "one of the important astronomical systems which is the subject of dark matter studies is galactic scale dynamics .",
    "the observations of galaxies reveal that there is a discrepancy between the observed dynamics and the mass inferred from luminous matter  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem of missing mass is to replace dark matter by a modified gravity theory .",
    "there are various approaches to modifying gravity , such as modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) or its relativistic version the so - called tensor  vector ",
    "scalar ( teves ) theory  @xcite . in some modified gravity theories ,",
    "the dark energy responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe is described by a generic function of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action , as in @xmath8-gravity models  @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , safe quantum gravity can produce quantum corrections derived from a renormalization group calculation , which can generate galaxy rotation curves compatible with observation  @xcite .",
    "there has also been an attempt to interpret missing mass by introducing non - local gravity  @xcite .",
    "the generally covariant modified gravity ( mog ) theory is a scalar tensor vector gravity ( stvg )  @xcite . in the following , we will study its astrophysical applications and possible predictions  @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the dynamics of a test particle are given by a modified equation of motion in which , in addition to the curvature of space  time , a massive vector field couples to the charge of a fifth force and produces a lorentz - type force .",
    "since the metric field is coupled to scalar fields and a massive vector field , the solution of the field equations for a point mass is different from the point mass schwarzschild solution of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of mog for the rotation curves of galaxies have been compared to the data  @xcite , using a static spherically symmetric point mass solution derived from the field equations .",
    "the same approach has also been applied to the dynamics of globular clusters  @xcite , clusters of galaxies  @xcite and the bullet cluster  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the weak field approximation of the mog field equations by perturbing the fields around minkowski space  time . the result for the dynamics of a test particle",
    "is that the acceleration of a particle is driven by an effective potential .",
    "this potential contains newtonian gravity with a larger gravitational constant @xmath9 and a repulsive force with a length scale @xmath10 associated with a massive vector field . for length scales shorter than @xmath10 ,",
    "when the yukawa exponent is of the order of unity , the repulsive force cancels the strong attractive force and we recover newtonian gravity . on the other hand , at larger length scales the repulsive vector field force becomes weaker and we obtain a newtonian potential with a larger newtonian constant @xmath9 .",
    "the advantage of the weak field approximation , in contrast to the exact spherically symmetric point particle solution of the mog field equations , is that we can use it to describe extended objects such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies . the agreement of general relativity with solar system data is retained by the modified acceleration law for massive test particles , derived in the weak field approximation from the mog field equations .",
    "in section ( [ mogfield ] ) , we review the action and the field equations of mog . in section ( [ weakapprox ] )",
    ", we obtain the weak field approximation of mog and derive an effective potential for an arbitrary distribution of matter . in section ( [ rotcurve ] ) , we apply the results of the weak field approximation to two classes of galaxies . for the first class , we use the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) catalogue of nearby galaxies to fix the two free parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the theory .",
    "then we apply the effective potential predictions to fit the observed galaxy rotation curves in the ursa  major catalogue of galaxies with the only free parameter , the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath7 used to fit the galaxy data are shown to be correlated with the coluors of galaxies .",
    "based on the dynamics of galaxies derived from mog and the luminosities of galaxies obtained from observation , we obtain results in good agreement with the tully  fisher relation .",
    "section ( [ conc ] ) contains a summary of our results .",
    "we use the metric signature convention @xmath11 . the generic form of the mog action is given by @xcite :",
    "@xmath12 it is composed of the einstein gravity action : @xmath13 the massive vector field @xmath14 action : @xmath15\\sqrt{-g}~d^4x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the action for the scalar fields : @xmath16\\sqrt{-g}~d^4x . \\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath18 , the faraday tensor of the vector field is defined by @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath21 is a scalar field representing the gravitational coupling strength and @xmath2 is a scalar field corresponding to the mass of the vector field .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the self - interaction potentials associated with the vector field and the scalar fields , respectively . the action for pressureless dust can be written as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the density of matter and @xmath27 is the fifth force source charge , which is related to the mass density , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant .    varying the action with respect to the fields results in the mog field equations .",
    "we start by varying the matter action @xmath30 with respect to the metric , which yields the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath31 the variation of @xmath30 with respect to the vector field @xmath14 results in the fifth force current : @xmath32 for the dynamics of a test particle , we adopt the action of a point particle  @xcite which can also be obtained by substituting @xmath33 in equation ( [ sm ] ) : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the fifth force charge of the test particle , which is related to the inertial mass of the particle , @xmath36 . varying this action results in the equation of motion of a test particle with an extra force on the right - hand side : @xmath37 as in general relativity , the equation of motion is independent of the mass of the test particle , so that the particle motion satisfies the weak equivalence principle .",
    "a main difference between this equation of motion and the standard geodesic equation in general relativity is that the fifth force contributes an extra repulsive force which depends on the velocity of the particle .",
    "we set for simplicity the potentials of the fields to zero i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , the exact static spherically symmetric solution of the mog field equations has been obtained for a point - like mass @xcite . for extended physical systems",
    ", we must use numerical calculations to solve the nonlinear mog field equations .    a natural way to study",
    "the behaviour of mog on astrophysical scales is to derive a weak field approximation for the dynamics of the fields .",
    "our aim is to obtain the field equations for such a weak field approximation by perturbing the fields around minkowski space ",
    "time for an arbitrary distribution of non - relativistic matter .",
    "we perform a perturbation of the metric around the minkowski metric @xmath39 : @xmath40 for the vector field , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the zeroth order and @xmath43 the first order perturbations . for minkowski space ",
    "time , we set @xmath42 equal to zero , for in the absence of matter there is no gravity source for the vector field @xmath14 .",
    "we write for convenience @xmath44 . for the scalar field @xmath21 ,",
    "we perturb it around the minkowski metric background : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant in minkowski space .",
    "we perturb the scalar field @xmath2 around the minkowski space background : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant which we for convenience will label as @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath49 is negligibly small and fix the scalar field @xmath2 in equation ( [ scalar ] ) to be the constant value @xmath2 , representing the mass of the vector field . finally , we perturb the energy - momentum tensor about the minkowski background : @xmath50    we vary the action with respect to the three fields @xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath14 , taking into account the perturbations around flat space .",
    "varying the action with respect to the @xmath21 field gives @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the first ",
    "order perturbation of the ricci scalar .",
    "again , for convenience , we replace the background value of @xmath46 by @xmath53 .    varying the action with respect to the metric and ignoring the higher orders of perturbation , we get @xmath54 where the first term on the right - hand side of this equation represents the energy - momentum tensor of matter , and the second term corresponds to the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the vector field given by @xmath55 by taking the trace of equation ( [ ein1 ] ) , we obtain on the left - hand side of the equation @xmath56 and on the right - hand side the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of matter and the vector field .",
    "we will ignore the higher order perturbation of the vector field @xmath14 , and ignore the density of the vector field compared to the density of matter ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) . the trace of equation ( [ ein1 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath58 where on the right - hand side we have for pressureless matter @xmath59 . substituting equation ( [ perturbr ] ) into equation ( [ g1 ] ) , for the static solution",
    ", we get @xmath60 from the solution of this equation , we know that @xmath61 is of the order of the gravitational potential or @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the internal velocity of the system .",
    "hence , for systems such as galaxies or clusters of galaxies , the deviation from the constant @xmath53 is of the order of @xmath64 . in what follows",
    ", we only keep the background value of @xmath53 in our equations .    in the weak field approximation , for the @xmath65 component",
    "we have @xmath66 and we obtain the field equation : @xmath67    for the vector field , we obtain the field equation by varying the action with respect to @xmath68 : @xmath69 let us assume that the vector matter current @xmath70 is conserved , @xmath71 , then we can impose in the weak field approximation the gauge condition , @xmath72 . for the static case , we obtain @xmath73 which has the solution @xmath74    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      observations by tully and fisher ( 1977 ) showed that there is an empirical relation between rotation curves of galaxies and their luminosities , @xmath75 .",
    "we want to test whether this relation is satisfied in mog .",
    "the right - hand side of the tully - fisher relation ( absolute magnitude ) can be obtained from observations , using the apparent magnitude , distance and extinction factor . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotation curves of galaxies , as we discussed in the pervious sections , are measured .",
    "here we adopt the rotation velocities of galaxies from the best fits of mog to the data , given in the last sections .",
    "for the the tully - fisher relation , we can use both the maximum rotation curve of the galaxies , @xmath76 , and the flat rotation curve , @xmath77 .    in order to calculate the flat rotation curve",
    ", we adopt the convention in  @xcite : ( a ) for the galaxies with a rising rotation curve , @xmath77 can not be measured , ( b ) for the galaxies with a flat rotation curve , @xmath78 , ( c ) for galaxies with a declining rotation curve @xmath77 is calculated from averaging the outer parts of the galaxy . figure ( [ figtf ] )",
    "displays the distribution of galaxies in terms of apparent magnitude versus the logarithm of the flat rotation curve .",
    "the best fit to the data is given by the apparent magnitude : @xmath79 the slope of this function is compatible with the observational data analysed by verheijen ( 2001 ) .",
    "for various samples of galaxies the slope of the observed data in equation ( [ tuequation ] ) changes from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .    .",
    "[ figtf],width=302 ]",
    "we have developed the weak field approximation of mog as an alternative to dark matter models .",
    "mog is a covariant modified gravity theory which contains tensor , vector and scalar fields in the action .",
    "the non - linear field equations in mog and the equation of motion for a massive test particle were applied to the study of the dynamics of galaxies .",
    "the modified equation of motion contains an extra contribution from the gradient of the vector field @xmath14 , proportional to the fifth force charge @xmath35 , which is related to the inertial mass , @xmath82 .",
    "we expanded the fields in the mog action around minkowski space  time and combined the test particle equation of motion with the field equations .",
    "an effective potential for an arbitrary distribution of matter was obtained . for any extended object this effective potential",
    "is composed of an attractive and a repulsive yukawa contribution .",
    "it contains two free parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath83 is the characteristic length scale associated with the vector field @xmath14 .",
    "we have shown that the effective potential at small and large scales is given by the newtonian potential , but with different effective gravitational constants .    to test the observational consequences of the effective potential",
    ", we used the well measured things catalogue of galaxies to fit the theoretical rotation curves predicted by mog to the observed data .",
    "this catalogue of galaxies contains both lsb and hsb galaxies .",
    "for this set of galaxies , we let the three parameters of the model , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath84 be the free parameters of the theory .",
    "the best values from the combined likelihood functions yielded @xmath85 and @xmath86 . as for the second step",
    ", we used a larger set of ursa - major galaxies and with the fixed universal parameters @xmath87 and @xmath86 , we let the mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 of the galaxies be the only free parameter in the fitting of the data .",
    "we obtained excellent fits for the velocity rotation curves to the observational data with the average value @xmath88 .",
    "as a prediction of mog , we compared the deduced stellar mass - to - light ratios of galaxies with their colours both for the things and the ursa - major galaxies . depending on the initial mass function ( imf ) the theoretical relation between these two parameters can change .",
    "in addition there is more uncertainty in the shorter wavelengths data compared to the near infrared wavelengths data .",
    "our mog prediction in the infrared wavelengths ( @xmath89 m ) was consistent with the predictions of theoretical astrophysical models .",
    "the advantage of this result is that , knowing the colour of galaxies in the infrared ( @xmath90 ) , we obtain valuable information about the stellar mass to light ratios @xmath7 . on the other hand , from the luminosity of galaxies in the visual band and the hi radio emission data ,",
    "we can obtain the baryonic masses of the galaxies . from this information , we are able to calculate the dynamics of galaxies and other large - scale systems , such as clusters of galaxies and the merging of galaxies _ without any free parameters_. this means that there will be no free degrees of freedom in mog when calculating the dynamics of astrophysical systems .    in dark matter models",
    "in which galaxies are fitted with a dark matter spherical halo , it has not been possible so far to obtain parameter - free fits to rotation velocity curve data .",
    "dark matter profiles require at least two free parameters for each galaxy , in addition to the stellar mass - to - light ratio , to enable fits to rotation curve data .",
    "this is in contrast to our results for mog which yields excellent fits to rotation curve data with only one free parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we can successfully predict the tully - fisher relation for galaxies because of the direct relationship between rotation curves and luminous matter .",
    "this is not possible in standard dark matter models because there is no relation between the dominant dark matter and the stellar luminosity of galaxies .",
    "we used the values of the flat rotation curves of galaxies predicted by mog and plotted the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies in terms of @xmath91 .",
    "the best fit to the data has a slope of @xmath92 , which is in good agreement with the observed data .",
    "our analysis from the solar system scale to the galactic scales showed that mog is a consistent covariant modified gravity theory without exotic dark matter , and for these scales we can replace the non - linear mog field equations with an effective weak field gravitational potential , which can be easily adapted to any astrophysical system .",
    "the john templeton foundation is thanked for its generous support of this research .",
    "the research was also supported by the perimeter institute for theoretical physics .",
    "the perimeter institute was supported by the government of canada through industry canada and by the province of ontario through the ministry of economic development and innovation .",
    "we also would like to thank niayesh afshordi , viktor toth and martin green for helpful discussions and comments .",
