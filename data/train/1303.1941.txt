    "in recent years , the production and application of ultracold molecules have attracted much attention .",
    "ultracold polar molecules in particular are being investigated eagerly because of their great promise for numerous applications such as the quantum simulator@xcite , ultra high precision measurements@xcite , ultracold chemical reactions@xcite , _",
    "etc_. however , adaptation of standard laser cooling techniques to molecules is not readily achieved .",
    "instead experimentalists have employed a scheme to convert ultracold atoms into molecules without heating , _",
    "i.e. _ the combination of fano - feshbach resonance(ffr ) and stimulated raman adiabatic passage(stirap)@xcite .",
    "in this scheme , two atoms get combined to form a quasi - bound molecule in a higher electronic state via a ffr .",
    "the molecules formed get subsequently transferred to the ground state by two color laser pulses .",
    "in this situation , the total production rate is limited by the ffr conversion rate , the transfer efficiency of stirap being very high . developing an understanding of the ffr phase of the ultracold molecule formation process thus remains important .",
    "the first reported experiment@xcite swept the external magnetic field to move the unbound low temperature atoms through the ffr region . according to the experiments , the molecular conversion rate saturates at a very slow magnetic sweep , the so - called adiabatic region .",
    "the adiabatic magnetic sweep is used for the ground state molecular production experiments@xcite in order to maximize the number of molecules at a given temperature .",
    "this paper focuses on molecular production at the adiabatic region .",

    "at any rate , hodby _",
    "et al_.@xcite , developed a semi - classical monte carlo simulation method , called the stochastic phase space sampling(spss ) method to estimate the relation between phase - space density and molecular conversion rate by using a phase - space criterion dependent on a single parameter fitted to the experimental data at one temperature .",
    "no explicit reference to the lz - type transition mechanism is made in this approach .",
    "nevertheless the spss method has been applied to the @xmath2k-@xmath2k@xcite , @xmath3rb-@xmath4rb@xcite , and @xmath2k-@xmath4rb@xcite cases , and the results show good agreement with the corresponding experimental data down to the lowest temperature realized in the lab .",

    "s.  watabe and t.  nikuni@xcite extended the theory of williams _",
    "et al_. and proposed the so - called ( chemical ) equilibrium theory ( chet for short in this paper ) .",
    "the chet has been applied to noninteracting ideal atomic gases trapped by a harmonic potential , resulting in agreement with the @xmath3rb-@xmath4rb experiment down to the lowest temperature realized in the lab .",
    "and they commented in ref.@xcite on a possible difference between the spss model and the chet , at temperatures below the bec - critical temperature @xmath5 , a vital region that has not been experimentally examined in detail thus far .",

    "as regards the spss model , no systematic assessment of its basic assumptions has been made .",
    "there has been no study of the meaning of the phase - space criterion adopted , nor of possible alternative criteria .",
    "here we propose a few new phase - space criteria for comparison and analyze the temperature dependence of molecular conversion rate for each criterion . in doing so , we present an overview of the statistical evaluation of the ultracold molecular conversion rate through comparison between the spss and the chet models . furthermore , the molecular conversion rate below @xmath5 is estimated since its experimental and theoretical exploration is much desired . to understand the dependence on thermodynamic distributions of the atoms and on the phase - space criterion adopted",

    "the results are compared with the chet results . through these comparisons ,",
    "we clarify the distinct temperature dependence of the molecular conversion rate between the spss and chet models qualitatively .",
    "number - imbalanced systems are also considered for other effects such as the gravitational sag as well as the gap between two different values of @xmath5 .",

    "we define four independent phase - space criteria , the first one being the version initially employed by ref.@xcite which yielded an extremely good fit to the experimental results for the bose gas and for a two - component fermi gas . as we will see in the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sect : discussions ] , all these separate criteria reproduce the temperature dependence of the experimental molecular conversion rate satisfactorily at thermal temperatures , but show some departures below the bec critical temperature .",

    "criterion 2 is introduced under the premise that the low partial waves are important for molecular formation .",
    "the use of @xmath8 instead of @xmath50 for criterion 2 is thus intentional .",

    "[ sect : discussions ] .",
    "the chet was developed by e.williams _",
    "et al_.@xcite , and extended further by s. watabe _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "it is based on the result of the coupled atom - molecule boltzmann equation approach . in the chet ,",
    "one solves simultaneous equations consistently with equilibrium conditions to obtain the molecular conversion rate .",
    "the first equation is the conservation of the total number of atoms , @xmath53 and the second equation states the constancy of the number of each atomic species , hence @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 denotes the number of the majority atoms , of the minority atoms , and of the molecules , respectively . and the ratio @xmath27 is defined by the initial ratio @xmath58 , where we consider @xmath59 , where @xmath60 thus @xmath61 .",
    "there are two equilibrium conditions , one representing chemical equilibrium , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the chemical potential of each component , and @xmath64 denotes the detuning , namely the energy difference between dissociated atomic state and the molecular bound state .",
    "the other condition represents thermal equilibrium , @xmath65 , where @xmath36 denotes the temperature of each component .",
    "the population of each component is a function of @xmath63 and @xmath36 .",
    "chet uses two assumptions .",
    "one is that the magnetic sweep process is adiabatic , thus the total entropy of the system is conserved .",
    "and the other one is that molecular production halts at @xmath660 , due to the conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "so the method first calculates the total entropy at @xmath67 at a given @xmath36 and @xmath27 , and then traces the adiabatic state until @xmath660 .",
    "thus the molecular conversion rate is given by equating the total entropy at @xmath67 and that at @xmath660 , @xmath68 where s denotes the entropy of each component .",
    "features of the molecular conversion rate are now explored for three statistically distinct types of atom - atom pair , namely fermi - fermi , bose - bose , and bose - fermi . to this end , we employ k@xmath1 as a prototype for our analysis , considering @xmath69k for the boson , and @xmath2k for the fermion .",
    "the k@xmath1 system simplifies the situation on two accounts .",
    "firstly , there is negligible gravitational sag thanks to the nearly equal masses of the isotopes .",
    "secondly , we may presume that there are no more than two characteristic temperatures in the k@xmath1 system , namely the fermi temperature @xmath70 and the bose - einstein condensation point @xmath5@xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile pointing out that in a theoretical proposal as well as in a recent experiment with @xmath2k-@xmath4rb@xcite , the authors of the experimental study employed an optical dipole trap with the so - called `` magic frequency '' , which eliminates the gravitational sag .",
    "for this reason , the molecules @xmath69k-@xmath2k and @xmath2k-@xmath4rb can be considered equivalent under an appropriate scaling of parameters@xcite . at any rate ,",
    "the issues gravitational sag and the gap in @xmath5 are explored as supplementary items later in subsection b.    let us now compare the results of spss models and that of the chet . to begin with ,",
    "observe that the chet is based on entropy conservation during an adiabatic magnetic sweep and on the condition that the statistical distribution of atomic pairs and that of molecules are always in equilibrium .",
    "the spss model presumes the conservation of the two - body local phase - space volume but no equilibrium .",
    "however , when atomic pairs are chosen the spss appears to be adiabatic since conservation of the phase - space volume amounts to adiabatic invariance and thus to conservation of entropy . but",
    "consistency with thermal equilibrium is not met . in the presence of an atomic bec in the bose - bose and bose - fermi cases",
    ", chet assumes the chemical potential of the bosonic atom component is 0 , so that the conversion rate gets flat - lined .",

    "the thermal limits look similar for the three types of systems .",
    "it is probable that this is due to the fact that the hamiltonian and the geometrical constraints are all quadratic in @xmath77 and @xmath78 . and also the chemical potential plays little role in the thermal limits .",
    "then the relevant quantities can all be expressed in terms of temperature - scaled distance and momentum , namely @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the conversion rate grows close to 100% as @xmath83 , suggesting complete overlap of the two becs in this limit which makes it easy to satisfy the imposed criterion .",
