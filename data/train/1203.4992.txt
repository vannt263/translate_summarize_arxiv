    "the presence of multiple stellar populations , in all globular clusters ( gcs ) so far spectroscopically examined , is shown with convincing evidence in the recent analysis of @xcite of about two thousand stars in 19 gcs .",
    "each cluster displays a sodium  oxygen anticorrelation",
    "( though the extension of the anticorrelation differ from cluster to cluster ) due to the existence of a population of stars which are richer in sodium and poorer in oxygen than halo stars with the same metallicity .",
    "the na  o anti  correlation is typical of gcs , whose constituent stars belong to two or more stellar populations differing in the abundances of the elements produced by the hot cno cycle and by other proton  capture reactions on light nuclei .",
    "in fact , these chemical signatures are present also in turn  off stars and among the subgiants ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so they can not be due to  in situ \" mixing in the stars , but must be due to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the cluster life .",
    "photometric evidences for the presence of multiple populations are also numerous , and sometimes suggestive of star formation occurring in separate successive bursts .",
    "the photometric signatures of different populations can be ascribed in part to helium differences , inferred from the morphology of the horizontal branches ( hb ) @xcite , or from the presence of multiple main sequences ( ms ) , in @xmath3  cen  @xcite and ngc  2808 @xcite .",
    "the strong link between the abundance anomalies ( sodium rich and sodium poor groups ) in the cluster m  4 @xcite and their location on the hb is proven by @xcite , who find that the blue hb stars of m  4 have high sodium , while the red hb stars have normal sodium .",
    "this supports the interpretation that there is a slight increase in the helium abundance of the  anomalous \" stars ( the sodium rich group ) @xcite .",
    "two other important links between photometric and spectroscopic evidence have been recently given .",
    "the first one comes from the analysis of elemental abundances of two main sequence ( ms ) stars in ngc  2808 @xcite showing that the blue ms star only has  anomalous \" sodium and aluminum .",
    "this supports the interpretation that the blue ms was formed from helium rich , cno processed gas .",
    "the second link has been stressed most recently by @xcite who , directly comparing the he  i  10  830  lines in the spectra of two ngc  2808 giants having different o and na abundances , find direct evidence of a significant he line strength difference . from a detailed chromospheric modeling , they show that the difference in the spectra is consistent and most closely explained by an he abundance difference between the two stars of @xmath4y @xmath50.17 , consistent with the expected difference in abundance required by stellar models to account for the blue ms .    based on these and on a large body of other complex evidences , the formation of globular clusters is now schematized as a two  step process , lasting no longer than @xmath2100 myr , during which the nuclearly processed matter from a  first generation \" ( fg ) of stars gives birth , in the cluster innermost regions , to a  second generation \" ( sg ) of stars with the characteristic signature of a distribution of element abundances fully cno  cycled .",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed to identify the matter constituting the sg stars : these could have formed either from the gaseous ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars or from the ejecta of fast rotating massive stars .",
    "these studies investigated whether the observed abundance patterns found in gcs can be accounted for by models .",
    "problems are present in both scenarios ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a critical review ) .",
    "in order to go from a  scenario \" to a  model \" , the sg formation must be investigated quantitatively , and must rely as far as possible on computed models . from this point of view , very few are the  models \" available in the literature , in spite of the large number of works recently published on this subject .",
    "in particular , the o  na anticorrelation is a signature present in all cluster , but the cluster - to - cluster differences are very large : some clusters ( the most massive ones ) show very extended anticorrelations , down to values of [ o / fe ] , more than 1  dex smaller than the values of the fg stars , other clusters show a  mild \" anticorrelation , in which [ o / fe ] is reduced by @xmath20.20.3  dex . in addition ,",
    "@xcite point out that there is a direct correlation between the _ minimum _ [ o / fe ] and the _ maximum _ [ na / fe ] for the examined clusters .",
    "any model , in the end , must account quantitatively for these features .",
    "@xcite followed the hydrodynamical formation of a cooling flow at the cluster center that occurs following the epoch of supernovae type ii ( sn  ii ) explosions , and the associated loss of the remnant gas from which the fg stars had formed .",
    "the cooling flow is due to the low ",
    "velocity stellar winds and planetary nebulae of super  agb and massive agb stars , and meets the physical conditions for a second epoch of star formation .",
    "they show that the three populations with different helium content , necessary to explain the presence of a triple main sequence in ngc  2808 @xcite can be reproduced if the most helium rich population forms from the pure ejecta of super  agb stars , collecting in the cluster core devoid of pristine gas after the end of the sn  ii epoch . afterwards , pristine gas is re - accreted and mixes with the massive agb ejecta , giving origin to the intermediate population having a helium content intermediate between that of the agb and of the pristine gas .",
    "this hydrodynamical model could investigate only the helium content behaviour , as the yields of super  agb stars for elements different from helium were not available at that time .",
    "it is important to understand whether the agb pollution model is consistent with the other abundance patterns of gc stars , so @xcite ( hereafter d2010 ) developed a chemical evolution model to test how the o  na and mg  al anticorrelations could be built up in different clusters . d2010",

    "originally , @xcite proposed to explain the color spread in the hb of most gcs not as an effect of a mass loss spread , as generally thought , but as an effect of helium increase from the cooler to the hotter side . at a given age ,",
    "the mass of stars evolving off the main sequence is smaller for larger helium abundances .",
    "this implies that , for a similar mass loss , stars with a larger helium abundance end up with a smaller mass and thus at a bluer location on the hb .",
    "depending on the metallicity , a very small helium increase ( from y=0.24 to y@xmath110.27 ) is necessary to produce the gap a real lack of stars in the rr  lyr region between the red clump and the blue hb in ngc  2808 @xcite . in clusters like m  4 ,",

    "thus we employ in the following @xmath230  myr as total duration of the sg sn  ii epoch .",
    "the main difficulty encountered in models including sn  ii explosions from the extreme sg is to reproduce at the same time the extension and distribution of stars along the o ",
    "na anticorrelation and the helium distribution function .    * case ngc  2808 - 3 ( fig .",
    "[ f9 ] ) : in this model we stop the sg formation from pure ejecta at 50  myr , allow for a @xmath2330  myr period without star formation , and then resume star formation from the agb ejecta mixed with pristine gas , with a choice of = 87  myr .",
    "the clumps in the distribution of stars in the o  na plane are probably too separated to be consistent with the observations . moreover , in order to obtain a reasonable number ratio between the extreme stars ( y@xmath180.34 ) and the intermediate population ( y@xmath20.30 ) , we are forced to extend the star formation of this latter population to @xmath220 myr , much longer than allowed by the beginning of the new ( third ) sn ii epoch . * case ngc  2808 - 4 ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , top panel ) : this model is identical to ngc  2808 - 3 , but we limit the formation of the intermediate population to 90  myr : as discussed above , the intermediate population is a bare 11% , too small to reproduce the number ratio of the extreme and intermediate  helium ms . * ( case ngc  2808 - 5 , fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , bottom panel ) : we increase the relative number of intermediate population stars by increasing the dilution .",
    "the second peak of helium content occurs at y@xmath20.28 , and the number ratio of extreme and intermediate population becomes reasonable , but the o  na values become much too close to the fg values , due to the strong dilution ( a problem discussed in @xcite in a different context ) .",
    "we find then that these simulations do not reproduce the observations so well as models ngc  2808 - 1 and 2 .",
    "nevertheless , the variety of observational results for different clusters may have their explanation in the variety of relevant parameters .",
    "for instance , model ngc  2808 - 4 ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] top panel ) could be relevant to explain the horizontal branch stellar distribution of the cluster ngc  2419 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have explored the possible role of super - agb in the formation of the observed abundance patterns in multiple - population globular clusters .",
    "our models are based on the set of yields calculated by @xcite .",
    "the results of our investigation show that the new super  agb yields broaden the range of possible formation histories leading to the observed abundance patterns . specifically :    * we have built models for m  4 , a cluster representative of numerous other gcs characterized by a shorter na  o anticorrelation . for this cluster ,",
    "we show that the observed abundance pattern can be reproduced also by models with a short sg formation phase ( @xmath2 10 - 20  myr ) involving only super - agb ejecta and pristine gas .",
    "we confirm that models presented in our previous work ( dercole et al .",
    "2010 ) which are characterized by a more extended sg formation epoch involving super  agb and agb ejecta ( along with pristine gas ) can also reproduce the observed abundance patterns .",
    "while models with a shorter sg formation epoch can include the effect of sg sn  ii , the narrower range of agb progenitors providing gas for sg formation implies that they require a larger fg initial mass ( by a factor 3 - 4 compared to models with a more extended sg formation phase ) . * in order to account for the o - poor na - rich stars of ngc 2808 we assumed the presence of deep - mixing in sg giants forming in a gas with helium abundance y@xmath0 , which significantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content , while preserving the sodium abundance . the use of the super ",
    "agb yields does not change the main requirements on sg formation history of models for the more complex clusters like ngc  2808 . in these clusters , an extreme population with very large helium content form from the pure ejecta of super  agb stars , followed by formation of an intermediate population by dilution of massive agb ejecta with pristine gas .",
    "we also attempted to model the three populations of ngc  2808 allowing for a long hiatus between the formation of the extreme and intermediate population ( possibly due to sn  ii explosions of the extreme populations ) , but our attempts to model each star formation epoch in a period as short as @xmath210  myr were not satisfactory .",
    "nevertheless , further study is probably needed to settle this issue .",
    "we finally want to point out that one - zone models such as those presented here ( and in d2010 ) , while very useful to understand rather easily and very quickly the role of different ingredients in shaping the gc chemical evolution ( agb ejecta , amount of pristine gas , duration of the system evolution , etc . ) , can not of course capture the complexity and variety of effects connected with the gas hydrodynamics . as a simple example",
    ", we mention that , during the cooling flow evolution of the gc gas ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of it cumulates in the centre of the cluster which therefore at each time hosts not only the agb ejecta delivered `` in situ '' , but also that delivered at earlier times by fg stars located at the gc outskirts .",
    "it is thus expected that sg stars with different chemical properties can form in different places at the same time , and not only at different times as in one - zone models .",
    "for this reason we plan to work out hydrodynamic models similar to those of @xcite , but taking into account the detailed chemistry as in the present models .",
