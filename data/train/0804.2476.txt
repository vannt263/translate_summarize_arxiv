    "stars escaping from a star cluster in the gravitational field of a galaxy form extended _ tidal tails_. these have been observed in the milky way @xcite and have often been modelled @xcite .",
    "they exhibit significant longitudinal structure , i.e. clumps , or over- and under - densities , which are usually attributed to the influence of gravitational shocks , e.g. encounters with spiral arms or giant molecular clouds , or passages through a galactic disk or past a galactic bulge , or simply motion in a triaxial potential . here",
    "we show that clumps also arise when the tidal field is static , in the simplest case of a star cluster in a circular orbit about an axisymmetric galactic potential . in the next section",
    "we describe a theoretical approach to the problem , which we verify in @xmath0-body calculations in section 3 .",
    "the final section is a slightly extended summary with discussion .",
    "as in standard theory @xcite we describe the position of a star in a rotating , accelerated coordinate system with origin at the centre of the cluster , and axes aligned towards the galactic anticentre , in the direction of galactic motion of the cluster , and orthogonal to the plane of motion of the cluster , respectively .",
    "then the equations of motion are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the cluster around the galaxy , @xmath3 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath4 is the frequency of motions orthogonal to the plane of motion of the cluster , and @xmath5 is the gravitational potential of the cluster stars .",
    "we are interested in escaping stars , and so we shall adopt a point - mass approximation for @xmath5 .",
    "we let @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the total mass of the cluster and @xmath9",
    ". there are equilibria at the lagrangian points @xmath10 , where @xmath11 the total effective energy of a star ( per unit mass ) is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the star s speed and the effective potential energy is @xmath14 the lagrangian points are saddle points of @xmath15 , where its value is @xmath16 .",
    "this is also the escape energy from the potential well of the cluster in the galactic field .    except for high - speed escapers created in few - body encounters ,",
    "stars escape as a result of two - body encounters and then an escaper usually has an energy only slightly above the escape energy @xmath17 @xcite . therefore such escapers pass close to one of the lagrange points at slow speed .",
    "thereafter the acceleration due to the cluster rapidly diminishes , and the motion of the escaping star can be well approximated by eqs.([eq : xeom])-([eq : zeom ] ) with the right sides set equal to zero .",
    "the solution starting at time @xmath18 at position @xmath19 with zero velocity is then easily found to be @xmath20 the solution for the stars starting at @xmath21 can be found as easily .    after leaving the lagrange",
    "point the solution traces an oscillatory path along the tidal tail and comes to rest again at the cusp of the orbit , which is reached when @xmath22 at this time the location of the star is @xmath23 where @xmath24    now let us suppose there is a stream of stars following this motion . because the @xmath25component of velocity is zero at @xmath23 , there is a peak ( actually , an infinite peak ) in the distribution of the values of @xmath26 at this location . in the evolution of a star cluster , however , it will not be visible until the first escapers reach this location , at around time @xmath27 . furthermore , as the star cluster loses mass by escape , @xmath28 decreases , and the location of this peak moves closer to the cluster as the cluster dissolves .",
    "the existence of this peak , and the time when it begins to become apparent , are the two main predictions of this theory .",
    "now we discuss the extent to which the solution we have used is a satisfactory approximation to the motion of slow escapers from a star cluster .",
    "there are two factors to consider .    1 .",
    "the effect of neglecting the field of the cluster is shown in fig.[fig : orbitplot ]",
    ". what will be important in what follows is the @xmath26-coordinate of the first cusp after the star leaves the lagrange point , and it is clear that this is well approximated .",
    "our other main approximation is the assumption that the star leaves the lagrange point with a very small velocity .",
    "this can not be tested thoroughly without recourse to an @xmath0-body simulation , which we postpone to sec.[sec : numerical ] .",
    "but we can develop a feel for the result by changing the initial conditions , e.g. by adding a small initial value to @xmath26 , of order @xmath28 .",
    "then the cusp is displaced in @xmath26 by the same amount , so that the relative displacement of the cusp is @xmath29 which is @xmath30 in the case of a point - mass potential in which @xmath31 .",
    "while this is not large , it shows that the density enhancement at @xmath32 will be smoothed out .",
    "similar results are obtained if we vary other initial conditions appropriately , though usually the cusp disappears , and may be replaced by a small epicyclic loop .",
    "this calculation also shows that the distance of the density enhancement from the star cluster is of order @xmath33 tidal radii , again in the case of a point - mass galactic potential .",
    "now we consider the number of stars between the cluster and the first density enhancement ( near @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is occupied by stars which escape in a time interval of order @xmath27 .",
    "if we assume that a constant fraction , @xmath34 , of stars escapes in each half - mass relaxation time ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the relevant number of escaping stars is @xmath35 where @xmath36 in which @xmath37 is the half - mass radius , @xmath0 is the number of stars , @xmath38 is the ( mean ) stellar mass , and @xmath39 is a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 the point of this result is not so much to furnish a numerical estimate , but to point out that it is only weakly dependent on @xmath0 . in this sense",
    "a single numerical simulation with large @xmath0 is not more useful for investigating the distribution along a tidal tail than a single small simulation",
    ". however , relaxation proceeds by the cumulative effect of many small encounters , and the mean change ( in the energy of a star ) per encounter decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "therefore the assumption of zero velocity at the moment when the star crosses the tidal radius becomes increasingly accurate as @xmath0 increases , and we may expect that the density enhancements become increasingly pronounced in this limit .",
    "the numerical simulations used to verify the existence of the predicted substructure were carried out with the collisional @xmath0-body code nbody6 by sverre aarseth @xcite on the 52-processor sun fire e15k at the edinburgh parallel computing centre .",
    "we used the supercomputer as a work farm to compute a set of 64 renditions of our test model which were then coadded to gain statistical accuracy .",
    "the test model is a cluster of 1000 stars of each 1 @xmath41 , following a plummer density profile with a half - mass radius of 0.8 pc .",
    "the cluster orbits about a point mass galaxy of @xmath42 at a galactic distance of @xmath43 kpc , which corresponds to a rotational velocity of @xmath44 kms@xmath45 .    in this particular case of a point - mass potential the tidal radius , @xmath28 , is given by @xcite @xmath46 which yields an initial value of 12.9 pc for the above given values .",
    "therefore the cusps of the orbits of escaping stars are initially located at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 but this decreases with the ongoing loss of cluster mass .",
    "the epicyclic frequency of the cluster s orbit about the galactic centre is given by @xmath49 hence the time the first stars need to reach this first cusp , @xmath27 , is about 240 myr . before this time we do not expect any overdensity within the growing tidal tails .",
    "the simulations were conducted until total dissolution , which occurred at about 2000 myr . for several times",
    "the positions of the stars were first centred on the density centre of the remaining cluster stars within the tidal radius .",
    "this was done for each rendition before they were combined .",
    "then the number density of stars along the direction of the tidal tails , i.e. the y - axis , was counted in bins of 25 pc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : folded ] the time evolution of the number density of stars along the tidal tails is shown . due to the symmetry of the leading and trailing tail",
    "they have been folded together to increase the statistical accuracy . as predicted in section 2",
    "the first stars need at least the time @xmath27 to reach the first cusp of their oscillatory orbit along the tail at @xmath50 . at @xmath51",
    "the overdensity has built up completely and has become very pronounced .",
    "as time goes by , the loss of mass causes a decrease in @xmath28 , and by eq.([eq : yc ] ) the location of the overdensity moves closer to the cluster . at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 myr )",
    "the cluster mass is only about 300 @xmath41 , hence @xmath28 has decreased to about 8.6 pc and so @xmath54 is supposed to be at about 320 pc at @xmath52 which agrees fairly well with the numerical results .",
    "different simulations lose mass at different rates , and the resultant distribution of values of @xmath28 ( and hence @xmath50 ) contributes to the smoothing out of the density maxima as @xmath55 increases",
    ". nevertheless , there are signs of density extrema also at about @xmath56 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : speed ] the evolution of the mean speed outside the cluster is shown . the velocity change as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] is fairly well reproduced . in the beginning",
    "the mean speed is dominated by a few high - velocity escapers .",
    "but after building up , the overdensities correspond to a minimum in the mean speed while maxima correspond to underdensities . here",
    "again the second peak is visible .",
    "furthermore the initial rise of speed verifies the assumption that most stars leave the cluster with small velocities .",
    "[ fig : contour ] shows a snapshot of the surface density along the tidal tails after 1250 myr . in both the x - y and y - z plane the over- and underdensities",
    "are fairly pronounced , including ( especially in the upper diagram ) the additional overdensities at @xmath57 .",
    "we have considered the longitudinal structure of the tidal tails generated by stars escaping from a star cluster in a circular galactic orbit .",
    "even though the tidal field is steady ( in a rotating frame in which the cluster centre is at rest ) , the tails exhibits density enhancements .",
    "these correspond to places where escaping stars slow down in their epicyclic motion away from the star cluster . because stars escape with a somewhat limited range of initial positions and velocities ( when they cross the tidal boundary ) the location at which this happens is similar for most escapers , and the resulting density enhancement is visible in simulations provided that sufficient numbers of simulations are coadded to improve the sampling statistics .",
    "we have conducted such simulations , using stars of equal mass .",
    "the distance of the main clump is around 38 tidal radii , in the case of a galaxy modelled as a central point mass .",
    "similar clumps have been observed by @xcite , but those examples were a little ambiguous because ( i ) the galactic potential was triaxial , ( ii ) the orbit was not quite circular , and ( iii ) the code was collisionless . for these reasons",
    "the mechanism of escape in their model was not clear , and could include an unquantified episodic contribution from the time - dependence of the tidal field .",
    "nevertheless they showed that the clumps coincide with places where the escaping stars slow down .",
    "the main additional contribution of the present paper is that we have identified the mechanism causing those overdensities , by placing the problem in a more idealised setting and providing a theoretical explanation .    whether such density enhancements would be visible in the tidal tails of real star clusters is complicated by their mass spectrum and , especially for globular clusters , by the non - circularity of their orbits",
    "nevertheless our results show that the density enhancements in tidal tails , which are apparently observed , should not necessarily be taken to indicate time - dependent tides , or encounters with perturbers such as giant molecular clouds , dark matter clumps or spiral arms .",
