    "one of the best tools to use in attempting to disentangle the structure of the nucleon is lepton - nucleon scattering where the lepton , whose couplings to electroweak gauge bosons is fully known , is used as a probe on the constituents of the nucleon .",

    "for example ,",
    "the net number of up quarks in a proton is two , hence @xmath8 . by forming appropriate combinations of scattering cross - sections",
    ", quantities can be measured that correspond to these conserved quantum numbers and hence have simple values in the naive parton model .",
    "these quantities are referred to as parton model sum rules .",
    "they can then be compared with experiment and the fundamental properties of theory tested .",
    "this naive parton model is subject to corrections in the full theory of strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics or qcd @xcite , for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "these corrections fall into two types ; those that are strongly suppressed at high energy ( higher twist corrections ) and those that vanish only logarithmically with the momentum transfer .",
    "the latter are fully calculable in terms of the coupling constant @xmath9 of qcd .",
    "comparison of the sum rules with these qcd expectations then provides a powerful test of qcd and enables @xmath9 to be measured .    in the remainder of this article",

    "the baryon ( gross llewellyn - smith ) sum rule @xcite uses the average of @xmath31 measured on a proton and a neutron .",

    "@xmath95 the isospin ( adler ) sum rule @xcite measures the isospin of the target and depends on the difference in @xmath60 measured in neutrino scattering off proton and neutron targets . @xmath96",

    "we can introduce `` valence '' distributions defined by @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "hence the momentum sum rule .",
    "@xmath103 this sum rule can not be tested directly since the gluon distribution function does not appear in the structure functions .",

    "the integrals are related to the quantities @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath106 by @xmath107    the polarized isospin ( bjorken spin ) sum rule @xcite : @xmath108 if we assume that the strange quarks are unpolarized @xmath109 then we have the spin ( ellis jaffe ) sum rules @xcite @xmath110 the parton model prediction @xmath111 leads to a trivial prediction for the @xmath41 ( burkardt - cottingham ) sum rule @xcite .",
    "in the full theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) , the naive parton model and its expectations for the values of the sum rules are modified .",
    "these modifications are of two types . at high energy ( large momentum transfers ) , the coupling strength of qcd becomes small and perturbation theory can be used @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "corrections to the sum rules can be expressed as a power series expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath113 . at lower values of @xmath63 non - perturbative corrections",
    "enter which can be expressed as power series in @xmath114 . unlike the perturbative corrections ,",
    "these can not be calculated at present . in some cases",
    ", corrections to different processes can be related to each other and experimental results may be used to determine the effect of these corrections on the sum rules .",
    "this section analyses both the perturbative and non - perturbative corrections .    in section 2.1 perturbative corrections",
    "are given first in the framework of the qcd improved parton model .",
    "this approach allows to give a very appealing and intuitive description of the basic ideas of factorization and @xmath63 evolution of structure functions .",
    "we restrict our discussion in this paragraph to leading order corrections and will see that in the leading logarithmic approximation all sum rules remain valid .    for the discussion of higher order perturbative corrections it is convenient to employ the framework of the operator product expansion , since the structure of the corrections becomes most transparent in this more formal approach .",
    "it leads of course to the same results as one would get with the qcd parton model .",
    "in fact , the connections between both descriptions will be pointed out wherever possible .",
    "the operator product expansion has the further advantage that non - perturbative effects can easily be incorporated .",
    "power corrections of higher twist are studied in section 2.2 .        in the previous chapter",
    "the relation between the structure functions and quark distributions was given and it was stated that the naive parton model predicts the @xmath63-independence of the structure functions @xmath115 .",
    "violations of this scaling behaviour were observed experimentally and may be explained theoretically due to strong interactions .",
    "the qcd improved parton model gives a simple and quantitative description of these effects and introduces the correct @xmath63 dependence into the parton distribution functions .",
    "the qcd generalization of eqn .",
    "( [ f2parton ] ) is provided by the factorization theorem for deep inelastic scattering ( see @xcite ) @xmath116 here @xmath117 serves as a generic notation for @xmath118 and @xmath31 . for polarized structure functions @xmath119 one should replace @xmath120 by @xmath121 . for simplicity",
    "we consider the nonsinglet combination of structure functions like @xmath122 .",
    "accordingly @xmath123 are the appropriate combinations of parton densities , e.g. for @xmath124 one has @xmath125 in eqn.([factorization ] ) the factorization of high momentum ( short distance ) and low momentum ( long distance ) effects is expressed .",
    "the former are described by the coefficient function @xmath126 and calculable in perturbation theory . as a characteristic feature for perturbative computations",
    "one finds a dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath127 .",

    "the separation between the low and high momentum regime calls for another scale , the factorization scale @xmath128 . in the following",
    "we shall choose @xmath129 .",

    "two popular choices are the dis scheme and the @xmath138 factorization scheme ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) . with the @xmath63",
    "dependent quark distributions the structure functions can be rewritten in the following form if terms of order @xmath130 are neglected : @xmath139 it can be seen in the last step that in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) the relations between structure functions and parton distribution functions remain unchanged except that the parton densities now depend on @xmath63 . with the same modification",
    "all parton model sum rules of the previous chapter remain valid in this approximation .",
    "the @xmath63 dependence of the distribution functions and hence the structure functions and sum rules is most readily expressed by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution equation which to leading order in qcd has the following form @xmath140 if one is not restricted to flavour non - singlet combinations the other function @xmath141 comes into play due to the probability of finding a quark inside a gluon .",
    "both splitting functions are determined by perturbative qcd and can be written as an expansion in @xmath9 .",
    "this equation can be used to determine the perturbative qcd corrections to the various sum rules .",
    "it should be noted that the dglap equation contains more information about the behaviour of the structure functions than does the set of sum rules .",
    "however , the higher order qcd corrections to the sum rules are easier to compute than those to the dglap equation .",
    "hence while the dglap evolution equation is only known to order @xmath130 @xcite , @xcite , the corrections that we discuss below to some of the sum rules are known to order @xmath142 .",
    "modifications of the sum rules due to higher order qcd corrections were indicated in the previous section for the qcd improved parton model . in this section",
    "we explicitly discuss those corrections .",
    "their structure becomes particularly transparent in the framework of the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "this approach will also prove to be useful in the following section for the discussion of non - perturbative effects .",
    "the mellin moments of the structure functions are expanded in a form @xcite where the short distance and long distance contributions are factorized in a similar fashion as in eqn.([factorization ] ) @xmath143 the expansion is expressed in terms of reduced matrix elements @xmath144 of operators renormalized at scale @xmath145 which describe the long distance effects and have to be determined from experiments and coefficient functions @xmath146 that describe the short distance effects and can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the operators are characterized by their quantum numbers which can be broken into two types .",
    "the label @xmath147 refers to the twist of the operator and @xmath4 refers to the flavor quantum numbers such as isospin .",
    "the `` twist '' of an operator is defined by its dimension @xmath148 minus its spin @xmath149 . since @xmath150 , operators of lowest twist ( @xmath151 ) dominate in the large @xmath63 limit .",
    "we shall postpone the discussion of higher twist operators to the next section and omit the twist label when considering the leading , twist-2 , terms .",
    "if one considers for simplicity the moments of flavour non - singlet structure functions , one can readily see the similarity between the approaches of the qcd parton model and the operator product expansion .",
    "taking the moments on both sides of eqn.([factorization ] ) shows that the parton model analogues of the coefficient functions and operator matrix elements of eqn.([factor ] ) are given by the following moments @xmath152    the @xmath63 behaviour of the coefficient functions is governed by their renormalization group equation @xcite , which follows from the fact that the lhs of eqn.([factor ] ) as a measurable quantity is independent of @xmath127 .",

    "the @xmath127 dependent part of the exponential in eqn.([rgesolution ] ) may be combined with the reduced matrix element @xmath166 to form the renormalization scale invariant expression @xmath167 in the case of the sum rules all relevant operators have @xmath168 .",

    "( [ cfexpansion ] , [ q2exponential ] ) the rhs of eqn.([factor ] ) approaches a constant value as @xmath171 that is basically given by @xmath172 and may be identified with the corresponding expression obtained in the naive parton model .",

    "in this case the anomalous dimensions vanish and the qcd corrections are already completely determined through eqn.([cfexpansion ] ) .",
