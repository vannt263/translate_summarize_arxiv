    "supermassive black holes are believed to power quasars and other types of agn .",
    "the agn activity manifests itself as radiation from the region around the black hole and as highly collimated outflows from the immediate vicinity of the black hole ( e.g. rees 1984 ) .",
    "two defining properties of astrophysical black holes that can be measured in principle are the black hole mass and spin .",
    "a significant amount of progress has been made toward measuring the masses of supermassive black holes ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) , though measuring the spin has been more challenging .",
    "general theoretical studies of black hole spins indicate that accretion of gas is likely to produce rapidly spinning black holes ( volonteri et al .",
    "2005 ) , the merger of two nonspinning black holes of comparable mass is likely to produce a rapidly spinning black hole ( gammie , shapiro , & mckinney 2004 ) , and the capture of a smaller companion may cause the hole to spin down ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) . to date , there are only a few direct observations that allow black hole spins to be studied .",
    "observations of seyfert galaxies suggest rapidly rotating black holes in these systems ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; fabian et al .",
    "a large spin is indicated by observations of the galactic center black hole ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ; ashenbach et al .",
    "2004 ) . and",
    ", x - ray observations of active galaxies suggest rapidly rotating black holes in these systems ( crummy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for the spins of black holes for fri and frii radio sources ( defined by fanaroff & riley 1974 ) have been made by meier ( 1999 ) in the context of a rotating black hole model , and several predictions of this model are very similar to those obtained in the model of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) .    in this work , a new method of measuring the spin of a supermassive black hole",
    "is proposed .",
    "the method may be applied to sources with large - scale outflows that power radio sources , and , perhaps , other types of sources .",
    "a double radio source is powered by two oppositely directed highly collimated outflows from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole .",
    "the spin energy that is available to power the outflow can be written in terms of the black hole mass and spin . thus ,",
    "if the spin energy and black hole mass can be estimated or constrained , the black hole spin can be estimated or constrained .    the method to obtain a measure of the black hole spin",
    "is described in section 2 .",
    "this method is independent of the specific model of energy extraction .",
    "the results obtained by applying the method are presented in section 3 .",
    "a discussion follows in section 4 .",
    "the results are obtained assuming a standard cosmological model with @xmath3 km / s / mpc , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and zero space curvature .",
    "the energy @xmath6 that can be extracted from a black hole is related to the black hole spin @xmath7 and mass @xmath8 , as discussed , for example , by blandford ( 1990 ) , where @xmath9 is defined in terms of the spin angular momentum @xmath10 , the speed of light @xmath11 and the black hole mass @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the gravitational radius of the black hole , @xmath14 .",
    "the spin energy is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the irreducible mass of the hole . setting @xmath6 equal to the spin energy and solving for the black hole spin , we find that @xmath17 where @xmath18 , or @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for sources with outflows powered by the spin energy of a black hole , the black hole spin @xmath1 can be measured when the total energy @xmath6 of the outflow and the black hole mass @xmath8 are known .",
    "determinations of the black hole spin obtained using equation ( 1 ) do not depend upon the details of the energy extraction .",
    "the use of this equation assumes only that the ultimate source of the energy is the black hole spin , and that , during the short period of spin energy extraction , the black hole spin changes only because of the energy extraction .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 provides an important diagnostic of the black hole system .",
    "studies of the ratio @xmath0 provide insight into the physical state of the system at the time the outflow is generated irrespective of whether the outflow is powered by the spin energy of the hole .",
    "the spin energy of the black hole is thought to power the large - scale outflows from agn ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; rees 1984 ; blandford 1990 ; wilson & colbert 1995 ; daly 1995 ; meier 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "the total energy @xmath6 that will be channeled through a large - scale outflow can be determined for the most powerful classical double radio galaxies ( e.g. daly & guerra 2002 ; wan , daly , & guerra 2002 ; daly et al .",
    "2008 ; odea et al .",
    "this empirically determined total energy @xmath6 can then be combined with the black hole mass to obtain the ratio @xmath0 and a measure of or bound on the spin parameter of sources using eq .",
    "( 1 ) . if only part of the spin energy is tapped , or if some of the tapped energy is dissipated or radiated away and does not reach the extremities of the radio source , the value of @xmath1 obtained using eq . ( 1 ) will be a lower bound .",
    "if the outflows are powered by energy from some other source , such as an accretion disk , then the energy per unit black hole mass , @xmath0 , could be used to probe the physics of the disk and , perhaps , place a limit on the black hole spin . for models in which the large scale outflow is powered by processes in the accretion disk , the black hole spin may be studied by combining the beam power of the outflow and mass of the black hole .",
    "there are 19 powerful radio galaxies for which we have estimates of both the black hole mass @xmath8 and the total energy @xmath6 .",
    "all of these very powerful frii radio sources have radio powers at least a factor of ten above the classical fri / frii transition , and are referred to as friib sources .",
    "the sources and their properties are listed in table 1 .",
    "the source redshifts range from 0.056 to 1.79 , and the hot spot to hot spot source sizes range from about 100 kpc to over 600 kpc ( odea et al .",
    ". the black hole mass for cygnus a ( 3c 405 ) is obtained from tadhunter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; those for the next four sources are obtained from mclure et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and those for the remaining 14 sources are obtained using equation ( 3 ) of mclure et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where the values of @xmath21 were provided by mclure ( mclure , private communication 2008 ) .",
    "the total energies are obtained from wan , daly , & guerra ( 2000 ) , guerra , daly , & wan ( 2000 ) , and odea et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and converted to the cosmological model adopted here .",
    "the energy from the two sides of each source are combined to obtain the total outflow energy @xmath6 , which is taken to be twice the weighted mean of the outflow energies from each side of the source .",
    "deviations of the magnetic field strength of the extended radio source from the minimum energy value only enter @xmath6 through the normalization of this quantity , as discussed in detail by odea et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . the lobes of cygnus a are used to normalize the sources , and an offset of 0.25 of magnetic field strength from the minimum energy value , appropriate for cygnus a ( carilli et al . 1991 ; wellman , daly , & wan 1997 ) has been adopted .",
    "note that if there is no offset from minimum energy conditions in cygnus a , the empirically determined values of @xmath6 and @xmath0 decreases by about a factor of 5 ( odea et al . 2008 ) , so the values of @xmath1 decrease by about @xmath22 from those discussed below .",
    "the dimensionless ratio of outflow energy to black hole mass , @xmath23 , is obtained for each source and substituted into eq .",
    "( 1 ) to obtain the spin parameter @xmath1 , and the values are listed in table 1 .",
    "the sources have very similar values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with no dependence of either parameter on source size or redshift .",
    "the weighted mean values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for these 19 sources are @xmath24 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , within the measurement error , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each source are consistent with the mean value of the 19 sources .",
    "the values of @xmath1 are shown as a histogram in figure 1 and as a function of black hole mass in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the total outflow energy as a function of black hole mass .",
    "it would appear that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for these friib sources is constant , suggesting that the physical state of the system at the time the outflow is generated is very similar in each of the sources studied .",
    "this could indicate that the outflow is triggered when a particular threshold , given by @xmath25 , is reached . a model that includes a threshold of this type",
    "is discussed by meier ( 1999 ) .",
    "a threshold for the onset of the outflow is also indicated by a comparison of individual source properties with the properties of the full population of sources ( e.g. daly & guerra 2002 ; daly et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "there are now many examples of galaxy clusters in which the intracluster medium ( icm ) has been displaced as the result of powerful outflows from agn ( e.g. mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ; rafferty et al .",
    "the displacement of the icm provides a measure of the total energy that has been pumped into the icm by the large - scale outflow from the agn associated with the central dominant galaxy ( cdg ) .",
    "if the highly collimated outflow is powered by the spin energy of the agn , then the energy of the outflow and the mass of the black hole can be combined to solve for the spin @xmath1 of the black hole .",
    "of the 33 galaxy clusters studied by rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , 29 have estimates of both the mass of the black hole associated with the large - scale outflow and the total energy input to the icm by the agn .",
    "one source , a1068 , does not have an estimate of the total energy input to the icm by the agn , and three sources , rbs 797 , macs j1423.8 + 2404 , and 3c401 , do not have estimates of the black hole mass .",
    "the remaining 29 sources are considered here .",
    "almost all of these sources have fri radio source structure or have amorphous radio structure , with a few exceptions such as cygnus a ( birzan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) was used to estimate the spin of each of the 29 sources for which there is a measure of both the energy @xmath6 and the black hole mass @xmath8 .",
    "the energy @xmath26 and black hole mass for each source are obtained from rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where the values of @xmath27 are used since they are obtained in a manner that is very similar to the black hole mass determinations described in section [ frii ] .",
    "the values of @xmath27 listed in table 3 of rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) had been modified by those authors by a factor of 0.35 , and this adjustment has been removed .",
    "this brings the mass estimates for cygnus a ( 3c 405 ) and m84 into good agreement with the independent determinations by tadhunter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and maciejewski & binney ( 2001 ) , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", the average value of asymmetric error bars was used .",
    "the values obtained for the ratio @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 of each source are listed in table 2 .",
    "the median value of @xmath1 is 0.026 , the average value of @xmath28 is @xmath29 , and the values of @xmath1 range from about 0.001 to 0.4 .",
    "a histogram of the values of @xmath30 is shown in figure 1 , and @xmath1 is shown as a function of black hole mass in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the total outflow energy as a function of black hole mass . clearly , there is a much broader range of @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 for the cdgs relative to those of powerful classical double radio galaxies .",
    "most of the values of @xmath30 lie in the range from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "the values of the energy extracted for the 29 cdgs studied include the energy extracted up to the time of observation , and each source is being observed at a different stage in its lifetime .",
    "in addition , relativistic plasma left from a prior outflow event could cause the outflow energy from the current outflow event to be overestimated .",
    "these effects can cause the observed distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be quite broad .",
    "the range of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the friib radio galaxies studied is remarkably small , while the range of values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for outflows associated with cdgs is quite broad .",
    "there are two key distinctions between these samples that may partially explain these differences .",
    "firstly , the outflow energy measured for a friib source is an estimate of the total outflow energy that will be produced over the entire lifetime of the outflow , whereas the outflow energy measured for the cdgs is an estimate of the outflow energy produced by the source up to the time of the observation .",
    "catching each cdg outflow at a different phase in the course of its lifetime will cause the distribution of outflow energies for cdgs to be broad ; this is not a factor for the friib sources .",
    "in addition , a prior outflow event from a cdg could cause the outflow energy of a given event to be overestimated .",
    "secondly , the friib radio galaxies are selected from the flux limited 3crr catalogue ( laing , riley , & longair 1983 ) , so only the most powerful sources are detected at each redshift .",
    "interestingly , the total outflow energy @xmath6 measured for powerful 3crr radio galaxies increases as @xmath33 ( odea et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the black hole mass rises as @xmath34 ( mclure et al .",
    "2006 ) , so the ratio @xmath0 is independent of redshift .",
    "the fact that lower mass and lower energy black holes are not observed at high redshift is due to the flux limit of the survey .",
    "the fact that the high mass and high energy sources friib sources are not seen at low redshift may suggest that the higher mass sources are more active at high redshift , or that changes in the environment cause the radio power of the sources to fall below the flux limit of the survey , that is , the sources may be lower power frii sources or fri sources , though they could still have large outflow energies ( e.g. hardee et al . 1992 ; odonoghue , eilek , & owen 1993 ; bicknell 1995 ) .",
    "a selection bias also seems to be present in the cdg sample ; the 6 sources with outflow energies less than @xmath35 are all at very low redshift , and the outflow energy , black hole mass , and black hole spin all tend to increase with redshift .    very powerful 3crr radio galaxies are likely to evolve into the cdgs ( lilly & longair 1984 ; best et al . 1998 ; mclure et al . 2004 ) .",
    "thus , the two samples studied are representative of the early and late phases of evolution of these systems .",
    "the systems have black holes with similar mass .",
    "clearly , the friib sources have a very small range of outflow energy per unit black hole mass , @xmath0 .",
    "it would appear that there is a larger range of values for this parameter for cdgs , but , given the factors affecting the measurements of outflow energy from black holes of cdgs , it is possible that these sources have a similarly small intrinsic range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results obtained here are consistent with the idea that the different radio structures of fri and frii sources are due to differences in their gaseous environments ( e.g. burns et al .",
    "1994 ; bicknell 1995 ) , and suggests that the gaseous environments of these sources has evolved significantly .",
    "the evolution of the gaseous environment could be due in part to the large - scale outflows ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; eilek & owen 2002 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that so few sources have values of @xmath1 close to the theoretical limit of unity ; that is , almost all sources have values of @xmath0 much less than the theoretical limit of 0.29 .",
    "all of the friib sources have @xmath36 .",
    "this suggests that each system is in a similar physical state at the time the outflow is generated , and may indicate that the outflow is triggered when a particular threshold is reached .",
    "if the sources have intrinsic values of @xmath1 that start out close to one , each outflow event is tapping a very small fraction of the available spin energy , and each source may have multiple outflow events .    the spin values obtained here could be compared with independent measures of the black hole spin .",
    "this may provide a diagnostic of whether it is the black hole spin or the accretion disk that is powering large - scale outflows from these sources .",
    "in addition , the method of using outflow energies and black hole masses to estimate black hole spins presented here may be applicable to other systems .    it is a pleasure to thank george djorgovski , brian mcnamara , david meier , and the referee of this paper for very helpful comments and suggestions on this work .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank ross mclure for providing stellar masses for the fourteen highest redshift sources listed in table 1 .",
