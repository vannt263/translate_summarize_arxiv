    "the wkb - theory works surprisingly well , but it breaks down in the vincity of _ quantal _ regions , where the wkb - wave function is plagued by singularities . for an exhaustive review on this topic see @xcite and references therein .",

    "we get the running time differences between classical and quantum motion moving from an arbitrarily chosen point to a turning point and back : @xmath115 from ( [ runningtime ] ) , we obtain the total time - shift between quantum and classical motion @xmath116 the total time - shift is a positive function of energy and a consequence of the isoenergeticity .",
    "its meaning is the following : the quantum particle moves with a larger local momentum as the classical particle does and reaches the turning point earlier than the classical particle .",
    "but for the backward motion the quantum particle is delayed with respect to the classical particle , resulting a positive , total time - shift .",
    "the delay of the quantum particle at the turning point stems from the finite quantum momentum there and reflects the finite probability for entering the potential barrier .",
    "we emphasize , that a negative sign of the total time - shift ( [ totaltimeshift ] ) would result in acausal behaviour , because then the quantum particle would leave before it would have arrived , which is not possible .",
    "the result ( [ totaltimeshift ] ) allows us to derive a remarkable property of quantum trajectories , that is , they leave the phase - space integral invariant . comparing the classical and the quantum mechanical phase - space integral ,",
    "this can easily be seen .",
    "if we define @xmath117 as the classical period and @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 from the last line of equation ( [ invariance ] ) equation ( [ totaltimeshift ] ) readily follows .",
    "thus , if isoenergeticity is fulfilled , classical and quantum mechanical motion are described by the same action hypersurface . with the time - shift ( [ totaltimeshift ] )",
    ", we now can construct the trajectories @xmath120 by this procedure one obtains quantum trajectories in the classically allowed region , forming a sum of disconnected branches @xmath121 the trajectories form disconnected branches , because their shape in the classically forbidden region is not available by the trajectory equation ( [ trajectoryeq ] ) , but below , when the quantum trajectories of the harmonic oscillator will be discussed , we will see how this problem can be solved in a physically reasonable way .",
    "to demonstrate how quantum mechanics is done from the hamilton - jacobi point of view , we will discuss two important systems , that are widely used as models for various physical systems : the linear potential and the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "especially , we will work out the differences between the schrdinger point of view and the hamilton - jacobi point of view . by the ladder",
    ", we will obtain an insight into the quantum mechanical behaviour , which can not be gained by the wave - function alone .",
    "we consider a linear potential @xmath122 . by this example , we will focus on the improvement , that is gained by the use of the zeroth order quantum correction function @xmath36 in contrast to the usual wkb - approximation . from the potential ,",
    "we obtain local the classical momentum and the local classical action as @xmath123 the zeroth order quantum corrections function in this case can be calculated analytically , giving @xmath124\\gamma_{1/3}\\left[-i 2 s(x)\\right]\\quad .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] during the following , we set @xmath125 and @xmath126 , because the system is translationally invariant on the energy - axis .    in figure ( [ linpot1 ] ) , we have plotted the phase - space functions of the linear potential . the quantum correction function @xmath127 , far away from the classical turning point , here @xmath128 , is negligible and the classical momentum @xmath27 is in charge .",
    "approaching the turning point region , the quantum correction function @xmath127 starts to grow , describing the importance of quantum mechanical behaviour in the vincity of the turning point . at the turning point itself , the real - part of the corrected momentum @xmath129 is finite , while the classical momentum @xmath27 is zero as usual .",
    "this allows only one interpretation : for a classical particle , the potential represents an inpenetrable barrier , and reaching the classical turning point leads undoubtedly to a change of the direction of motion . for a semiclassical particle , described by @xmath130 , the classical picture is not true anymore .",
    "the corrected momentum @xmath129 is finite at the classical turning point , meaning that the potential barrier becomes penetrable with some probability . for a classical particle ,",
    "the potential barrier represents a hard wall , but for a semiclassical particle , the potential barrier becomes soft .",
    "the softness of the potential barrier in the semiclassical case is decribed by the finite momentum functions and by the finite probability to find a particle inside the barrier .",
    "we want to emphasize here , that in the wkb - approach the potential barrier remains hard , because of the turning point singularity . the proper connection between classically allowed and classically forbidden region in the wkb - case can only be established by the knowledge of the exact solution of the schrdinger equation , leading to the reflection - phase @xmath131 . by the use of quantum correction functions ,",
    "the turning point singularity is overcome .",
    "the linear potential serves as a model for the one turning point case .",
    "taking the turning point @xmath76 as the turning point of the system , the wave - function can be constructed by ( [ wavefunctionleft ] ) @xmath132 \\cos\\left[-\\int_{x}^{\\infty}\\left(p(x')+\\re{q_{0}(x')}\\right)dx'-\\frac{\\phi_{\\leftarrow}}{2}\\right]\\quad.\\ ] ] the second turning point @xmath77 must be set to infinity .",
    "this becomes clear when we remember that ( [ wavefunctionleft ] ) was derived from the symmetry properties of a two turning point system : the particle comes in from infinity until @xmath76 is reached , where it is reflected back to infinity - and at infinity it is reflected again into direction of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a one turning point system follows from a two turning point system by setting one of the two turning points to infinity .",
    "this procedure is necessary , because it is the only way to take into account the symmetry properties of the quantum correction function as discussed above .",
    "together with ( [ phasertol ] ) and the symmetry property of @xmath133 we obtain the wave - function @xmath134 \\cos\\left[\\int_{x_{1}}^{x}\\left(p(x')+\\re{q_{0}(x')}\\right)dx ' - \\frac{\\phi_{\\leftarrow}^{{\\rm{inv}}}}{2}\\right]\\quad .",
    "\\label{wavefunctionlinpot}\\ ] ] expression ( [ wavefunctionlinpot ] ) perfectely demonstrates how the gauge - dependent part of the reflection - phase cancels , while the gauge - invariant part @xmath135 remains present .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ linpot3 ] ) the invariant phase @xmath136 is not the wkb reflection - phase @xmath137 obtained by the asymptotical expansion of the airy - function .",
    "the asymptotical reflection - phase follows from the limit @xmath138      the harmonic oscillator is surely the most considered and best understood quantum system .",
    "this fact makes it a very interesting test object for the viewpoint on quantum mechanics we haves developed here , because by the harmonic oscillator , we can demonstrate at best the differences between schrdinger and hamilton - jacobi quantum mechanics .",
    "we will work in suitably scaled quantities @xmath139 for simplicity , but without loss of generality , we have set @xmath140 in all numerical calculations .    in figure ( [ ho1 ] )",
    "we have plotted the quantum mechanical and the classical phase - space of the harmonic oscillator for the ground state energy ( left picture ) .",
    "again we see the typical effect of the quantum correction functions , breaking up the closed classical phase - space , thus making the potential barrier soft and penetrable .",
    "the effect of the quantum correction functions is largest for the ground state , as one would naturally expect , because the ground state is close to the anticlassical limit of the system .",
    "for the tenth excited state , the right picture in ( [ ho1 ] ) shows that the influence of @xmath26 already has declined , the system has already entered its semiclassical limit and quantum corrections become negligible .",
    "we will not present pictures of oscillator wave - functions here , because we think that up to now the reader might be convinced , that the wave - functions determined by ( [ wavefunctionright ] ) or ( [ wavefunctionleft ] ) are , up to the normalization amplitude , identical with the oscillator wave - functions determined by the schrdinger equation .",
    "instead we will focus on the calculation of quantities , that are not available within the schrdinger equation .    in figure ( [ ho2 ] )",
    "we have calculated the quantization curve and the maslov - index according the formulae ( [ quantization1 ] , [ quantization2 ] ) .",
    "the quantization curve determines the oscillator eigenstates by knowledge of the classical momentum and its quantum corrections .",
    "although the wave - function is implicitly known when the reflection phases ( [ phaseltor ] , [ phasertol ] ) are known , there is no need to employ them for determining the spectrum .",
    "the knowledge of the quantum correction functions is sufficient for a calculation from first principles .",
    "the maslov - index imposes a tiny oscillating structure onto the quantization curve .",
    "the nodes of these oscillations lie perfectely at @xmath141 , coincidence with the bound states and recover the bohr - sommerfeld rule .",
    "this behaviour of the maslov - index was first calculated in @xcite for the half - sided harmonic oscillator and by a different method .      for the harmonic oscillator , for further details",
    "see part i of this paper , we now will discuss the topic of quantum trajectories in detail .",
    "we will calculate and discuss trajectories for the ground state and the tenth excited state to illustrate the influence of the quantum corrections functions near the anticlassical and in the semiclassical regime .    by ( [ totaltimeshift ] ) the time - shift between quantum and classical motion , see figure ( [ ho4 ] ) is given as @xmath142    the lower bound in ( [ tratimeshift ] ) is zero , because we want to calculate the trajectory of a particle starting its journey from the minimum of the oscillator potential @xmath143 .",
    "we could have chosen any other point , the choice of the point of reference has no influence on the shape of the quantum trajectory . from the trajectory equation ( [ trajectoryeq ] )",
    ", we get @xmath144 where the index @xmath145 denotes the multiple branches obtained by shifting the time by @xmath146 in the classically allowed region for the forward and backward motion , respectively . by the trajctory equation ( [ trajectoryeq ] ) only the quantum motion between the two turning points can be determined .",
    "the cutoff at the turning points is the cause the multiple branches . if we compare ( [ trasubspace ] ) with the classical trajectory @xmath147\\quad . \\label{traclassical}\\ ] ] and unse the fact that quantum and classical motion are described by the same frequency , see ( [ invariance ] ) , we are lead to make the following ansatz for a quantum trajectory @xmath148,\\quad \\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}a_{{\\rm{q}}}(k,\\omega , t ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}}{\\omega^{2}}}\\quad . \\label{traansatz}\\ ] ] the limit in ( [ traansatz ] ) requires , that the quantum amplitude approaches its classical value in the classical limit .",
    "the fact that all quantum effects are now located in an amplitude - function reminds us of the path - integral , where the same phenomenon occurs : phase - quantities are given by the classical action function , but the time - evolution amplitude is quantum mechanical .",
    "however , by comparison between ( [ trasubspace ] , [ traansatz ] ) , we can establish a continous quantum trajectory without cutoffs at classical turning points by analytical continuation beyond the classical turning points , illustrated in figure ( [ ho3 ] ) .",
    "the reader might object this procedure by the argument , that by analytical continuation in this case a kind of information is gained , that does not exist .",
    "we agree with this argument to some extent and will therefor call the trajectories in the classically forbidden region apparent trajectories .",
    "the present situation is similar to the quantum time - shifts in @xcite , where it was found that apparent trajectories enter the classically forbidden region .",
    "but the difference between there to present is , that in @xcite the potential was a singular one - and no particle , classical or quantum can cross a singularity .",
    "but the harmonic oscillator is regular and by the quantum correction functions , the turning point region has become regular , too .",
    "further know we from above , that in the quantum case the potential becomes soft and therefor penetrable .",
    "all this put together means the following : for the harmonic oscillator , the reflection probability at a turning point is @xmath149 for all energies , thus the particle comes back in any case .",
    "the particle reaches the classical turning point with finite momentum , which imposes a time - shift in comparison to the classical particle and a phase - shift on the wave - function as a result of the soft boundary condition to be fullfilled .",
    "the phase - shift of the wave - function and the time - shift of the motion are two manifestation of the same phenomenon , the relative softness of the potential barrier in the quantum mechanical limit .",
    "all these facts allow only one interpretation , the particle as it has arrived at the turning point with finite momentum , goes beyond the turning point and enters the classically forbidden region , appears to be decelerated by the soft barrier , comes to rest and finally moves backward to be expelled again into the classically allowed region .",
    "the only explanation thus is the softness - effect of the potential barrier .",
    "we emphasize , that this softness has nothing to do with sticking or absorptive reactions , it is a pure quantum mechanical effect . for energies approaching the classical limit",
    ", the barrier hardens as is described by the limiting process in ( [ traansatz ] ) .",
    "we have shown how quantum mechanical problems can be solved within the framework of the hamilton - jacobi equation of quantum mechanics , where the central quantity of interest is the quantum mechanical action function instead of the wave - function . to our regards ,",
    "hamilton - jacobi theory and schrdinger theory are fully equivalent to each other , they describe the same physics and differ only in their descriptive manner .",
    "in contrast to the well - known madelung - de - broglie - bohm theory , we do not separate real and imaginary part of the action function initially . a very valuable feature of hamilton - jacobi theory is , that by use of the quantum action function , the wave - function can uniquely be decomposed into running waves in every point in space , regardless whether the wave - functions describes bound or scattering states . in the schrdinger point of view , this is possible only asymptotically .",
    "the use of quantum correction functions enopens a deeper insight into the quantum mechanical behaviour of systems , especially in the vincity of turning points , where the local quantum mechanical momentum is finite .",
    "this property overcomes the wkb - singulariy at classical turning points and furthermore clearifies the special behaviour of a potential barrier in the quantum mechanical case : the barrier becomes soft and therefor allows the quantum particle to enter it .",
    "this softness - property of the potential barrier in the quantum mechanical case is modeled by the soft boundary conditions the wave - function has to obey - and that can be solved exactly by help of the quantum action function - and also explain the finite probability of finding a particle there .",
    "the soft boundary - value problem is solved by a reflection phase .",
    "the reflection phase is the key - quantity to obtain the spectrum of a quantum system with help of a quantization curve and allows a direct calculation of maslov - indices . to obtain the spectrum of a quantum system by this method , only action and momentum functions have to be known , orthonormalized wave - functions are not necessary . especially for potentials where exact wave - functions are not analytically known",
    ", it may be much more simple to calculate the quantization curve instead of searching orthonormalized eigenstates with the schrdinger equation .    besides the hamilton - jacobi theory allows us to calculate quantities that are not available within the schrdinger point of view",
    ", the calculation of quantum trajectories is possible .",
    "the quantum trajectories obtained by the trajectory equation ( [ trajectoryeq ] ) are only defined in the classically allowed region , but by analytical continuation , they can be established also for the classically forbidden region in a physically reasonable manner .",
    "the behaviour of the trajectories again mirror the softness - property of the potential barrier in the quantum mechanical case and the finite probability to enter the classically forbidden region is all described by a total time - shift @xmath146 ( [ totaltimeshift ] ) .",
    "in contrast to de - broglie - bohm theories , no quantum potential is introduced , and therefor no equation of motion .",
    "moreover , the equation of motion in de - broglie - bohm theories @xcite and our trajectory equation ( [ trajectoryeq ] ) contradict each other .",
    "this result was also found by @xcite , but was interpreted differentely . although the trajectories obtained from the quantum action integral by use of the hamilton - jacobi formalism show a somewhat quirky behaviour , they are consistent with our results about the behaviour of the quantum correction function in the vincity of classical turning points and the behaviour of the wave - function .",
    "both , quantum correction functions and trajectories illustrate the softness of a potential function near the anticlassical limit",
    ". moreover , hamilton - jacobi formalism is theoretically very well founded and thus we expect ourselves so travel on safe terrain , whereas , as stated in @xcite the equivalence between velocity and quantum mechanical momentum in de - broglie - bohm theories is up to now an unproved assumption .",
    "the work of floyd @xcite interprets stationary hamilton - jacobi theory in a very different way as we have done here .",
    "although starting from the same key equation ( [ hjs ] ) , floyd developed a completely different theory by separating real and imaginary parts of the quantum action function . by the help of a constrained condition similar to ( [ isoenergetics ] ) he arrived at a nonlinear , second - order equation for the real part of the quantum momentum function @xmath150 \\quad , \\label{floydhj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 denotes a quantum potential .",
    "if @xmath24 is the classical momentum @xmath27 , we obtain from ( [ floydhj ] ) the well - known quantality function , that describes the break - down of wkb - theory in the vincity of classical turning points , see @xcite .",
    "but if we are interested in in the quantum momentum , we are not allowed to simply write @xmath152 because @xmath151 depends on @xmath24 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath24 has been obtained by ( [ floydhj ] ) , equation ( [ floydmomentum ] ) reduces to an identity @xmath153 which is of no use either . because of this , we have argued above , that the concept of a quantum potential becomes misleading in stationary hamilton - jacobi theory .",
    "our second objection is , that by transforming ( [ hjs ] ) into a real but second order equation , there occurs a loss of information , because for ( [ floydhj ] ) neither a closed solution formula , nor any initial conditions are known . the apparent arbitrariness for the choice of initial conditions in ( [ floydhj ] ) lead floyd to interpret , that there are infinitely many quantum microsates , associated with infinitely many possible initial conditions , that map onto the same energy - eigenstate . for nonlinear , higher order differential equations , its the crux of matter that no unique solution may exist , instead of a large number of different solutions , depending sensitively on initial conditions .",
    "but from such a multitude of solutions , the physically relevant one must be extracted . in our first order approach , this is naturally done by ( [ quasilintransform ] , [ operatorequation ] ) .",
    "moreover , the action deduced from ( [ floydhj ] ) , the real part of our action function , is assumed to be real on the whole space . comparing this with our findings above we can state that this is impossible , because a necessary condition for the wave - function to fall off in the classically forbidden region is a purely imaginary action function there .",
    "if the concept of the quantum potential would be dropped , this could be deduced from ( [ floydhj ] ) , together with the equations that relate real and imaginary parts of the action function .",
    "we close this comment and emphasize again , that to our regards , the hamilton - jacobi theory of quantum mechanics does not offer a kind of hidden information that is lost in the schrdinger point of view .",
    "the information provided by both theories is the same , only their descriptive manner is different .",
