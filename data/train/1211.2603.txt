    "as it is well - known , sawyer ( @xcite ) characterized the pair of weights @xmath1 for which the hardy - littlewood maximal operator , @xmath2 , is a bounded operator from @xmath3 to @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "he showed that @xmath6 if and only if @xmath1 satisfies the testing condition @xmath7 on the other hand , it is also known that the two weight muckenhoupt condition @xmath8 , @xmath9 is necessary but not sufficient for the maximal operator to be strong type @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that sawyer s condition involves the maximal operator itself makes it often difficult to test in practice . therefore",
    ", though this condition characterizes completely the two weight problem , it would be more useful to look for sufficient conditions close in form to the @xmath8 condition .",
    "the first step in this direction was due to neugebauer ( @xcite ) : he noticed that if the pair of weights @xmath1 is such that for @xmath11 , @xmath12 for all cubes , then @xmath13 for all nonnegative functions @xmath14 and some positive constant @xmath15 independent of @xmath14 .",
    "if for a given cube @xmath16 we define the normalized @xmath17 norm by @xmath18 then neugebauer s condition can be restated in terms of a normalized @xmath17 norm as follows : @xmath19 notice that the @xmath8 condition can also be rewritten as @xmath20 this tell us that if we replace the average @xmath17 and @xmath21 norms in ( [ ap ] ) by some stronger ones , then we can get a condition that is sufficient for ( [ strong ] ) to hold . at the same time , this new condition preserves the geometric structure of the classical @xmath8 .",
    "conditions like ( [ neugen ] ) are known as power bump conditions because the norms involved in the two weight @xmath8 condition are `` bumped up '' in the lebesgue scale .    motivated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , prez ( @xcite , @xcite ) generalized these last conditions replacing the localized norms in ( [ ap ] ) by some other larger than the @xmath17 one , but not as big as the @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , he proved that it was enough to substitute only the norm associated to the weight @xmath23 by a stronger one defined in terms of certain banach function spaces @xmath24 with an appropriate boundedness property .    to be more precise , we let @xmath25 be a young function ( cf .",
    "section [ sbp ] ) and define the normalized luxemburg norm on a cube @xmath16 by @xmath26 associated with each young function @xmath25 , one can define a complementary function @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "such @xmath29 is also a young function and it plays , together with the class @xmath0 , an important role in the generalization of these bump conditions . recall that a young function @xmath30 if there is a positive constant @xmath31 for which @xmath32 this growth condition was introduced in @xcite where it was proved that if @xmath25 is a young function such that @xmath33 , and @xmath1 is a pair of weights such that @xmath34 for every cube @xmath16 , then holds . moreover the @xmath0 condition is sharp in the sense that : if @xmath2 is strong @xmath35 and @xmath36 satisfy ( [ ap_m ] ) , then @xmath33 .",
    "this result has been generalized very recently to the more general context of banach function spaces by prez and mastylo ( @xcite ) . for a more complete account of all this",
    "we refer to the recent book @xcite .    besides its inherent significance for this problem , for",
    "many other operators conditions like ( [ ap_m ] ) have resulted in optimal sufficient conditions for weak and strong type inequalities . in general , given any pair of weights @xmath1 we will define the @xmath8 bump condition as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath25 are young functions such that @xmath39 and/or @xmath40 and @xmath16 is any cube @xmath41 . this or related conditions are being used in the study of operators more singular than the hardy - littlewood maximal function . the first case was considered by prez in @xcite for fractional integral operators where a fractional version of was used to obtain a two weight @xmath17 estimate . the same problem for the hilbert transform",
    "was proved in @xcite and by different methods in @xcite for any caldern - zygmund operator with @xmath42 kernel .",
    "very recently the solution was extended in @xcite to the lipschitz case , proved full in generality in @xcite and further improved in @xcite with a better control on the bounds .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the two weight norm inequalities for the boundedness of the strong maximal function using an appropriate @xmath0 condition .",
    "we define this operator as @xmath43 where @xmath14 is a locally integrable function and the supremum is taken over all rectangles @xmath44 with sides parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "the corresponding two weight problem for the strong maximal function was characterized by jawerth ( see @xcite ) in terms of a testing condition that it is even harder to verify than sawyer s condition ( [ sp ] ) .",
    "the problem was also solved in @xcite with a more similar approach to the one that we study here .",
    "it was proved that if @xmath1 is a couple of weights satisfying the power condition for some @xmath11 @xmath45 for every rectangle @xmath44 , and suppose that @xmath46 satisfies the condition @xmath47 : there are constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for all measurable sets @xmath51 , then @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", the strong weighted estimate is obtained from weak type ones using interpolation and the fact that there is a reverse hlder s property for the weights that verifies ( [ ap , r ] ) .",
    "however , this good property disappears if we substitute the @xmath22-norm associated to the weight @xmath23 by a weaker one .",
    "therefore , we will need a different approach to solve the two weight problem with general bump conditions .    to state the main result of this article",
    ", we define the class of young functions that enable us to obtain bump conditions in the rectangle case .",

    "* theorem 1.5 ) ) , then there is a key difference between them . for the former not only",

    ", we should keep in mind the next relevant fact .",
    "the study of the boundedness properties of a maximal operator with respect to a family of bounded measurable sets is closely connected to studying the covering properties of that family ( cf .",
    "but since the geometry of rectangles in @xmath41 is much more intricate than that of cubes in @xmath41 , the classical covering lemmas do nt work in the rectangle case .",
    "particularly , the caldern - zygmund decomposition that is strongly used in the cube case can not be used here . in this sense ,",
    "the condition @xmath47 is necessary to deal with rectangles and with their covering properties ( see lemma [ scatteredproperty ] below ) .",
    "the problem with this condition is that , as happened with sawyer s condition , it involves itself the operator and therefore it would be useful to have a replacement that did not .",
    "the @xmath68 condition would be a good candidate since it is simpler than the @xmath47 condition ; however , it is also stronger ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , repeated efforts to get a weaker condition and a simpler covering argument have failed , but we believe that such a result would be very interesting and would provide new insights about the study of the strong maximal operator .    in this article , we also address similar questions involving the multilinear version of the strong maximal function and some other more general maximal functions .",
    "we define the strong multilinear maximal function as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an @xmath71-dimensional vector of locally integrable functions and where the supremum is taken over all rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes .",
