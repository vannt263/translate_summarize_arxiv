    "the area of the surface of a nonspinning , quiescent ( schwarzschild ) black hole is is @xmath4 , which is written @xmath5 in the usual relativist s convention in which units are chosen so that both newton s constant and the speed of light are set equal to unity .",
    "the usual schwarzschild coordinate @xmath6 is defined to be an areal coordinate ( spherical area = @xmath7 ) , so its value at the black hole surface ( the _ horizon _ ) is @xmath8 . because the black hole is spherical",
    ", we simply need to measure the area in a transverse direction .",
    "this produces the unique result ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the uniqueness follows because if we consider a different definition of the 3-space in which we measure the area , we just shift our points in null directions along the ( null ) horizon .",
    "null directions have zero length and can not contribute to ( or change ) the area .    an occasional question to the teacher of relativity",
    "is :  ... then , what is the _ volume _ of a black hole ? \"",
    "the answer is that , unlike the response about the surface , the volume depends on the way that the 3-dimensional  constant - time \" space containing the black hole is defined .",
    "gravity , described by general relativity , is the curvature of space - time , and the implied curvature for the @xmath10 defined by our choice of constant time depends on how the  now \" space is defined .",
