    "during last decade the nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) were widely studied because of richness of physical effects and their broad spectrum of the practical functionalities@xcite . with small inertial masses and high frequencies of the nanomechanical resonators , together with the ultra - sensitive mechanical displacement detection capabilities of electronic devices used as detectors ,",
    "nems have great promise for application in the force microscopy and mass - sensing @xcite .",
    "many of the applications currently envisioned , such as switches , relays , and actuators , are directly related to the effect of mechanical motion on the electric properties of the system .",
    "recently , the first observation of quantum superposition of states of a mechanical resonator has been reported @xcite .",
    "bottom - up fabricated nems devices are prospective candidates for investigation of quantum effects in nems , since they have frequencies in ghz range , and these frequencies are tunable by the gate voltage@xcite .",
    "these devices , made of suspended carbon nanotubes , function in single - electron tunneling ( set ) regime . the coupling between the charge of the set and mechanical degrees of freedom is provided by the position dependence of the capacitance between suspended beam and the underlying gate , and of the tunnel rates between the reservoirs and the set island .",
    "it was theoretically predicted previously @xcite that for certain energy - dependent tunnel rates even at weak coupling between the set and mechanical motion the latter can considerably influence electric current  the phenomenon of strong mechanical feedback . at strong coupling ( see ref . ) , the effect of the mechanical motion is even stronger , and the physics is dominated by polaronic effect .",
    "this leads to multistabilities and switching in the regime of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the resonator frequency and the typical tunnel rate , respectively@xcite . for @xmath3 ,",
    "one observes franck - condon effect@xcite .",
    "recently , careful experiments on electric transport in suspended carbon nanotubes have been performed@xcite .",
    "in addition to source , drain and gate electrodes , an antenna emitting ac radiation was introduced close to the vibrating beam .",
    "a variety of interesting results have been obtained , including resonances , switching events , and gate voltage dependence of the quality factor of the mechanical resonator .",
    "there are indications that strong coupling regime may have been observed , at least in some parameter range .    in this article",
    ", we consider simultaneous effects of ac and stochastic forces on transport in set - based nems .",
    "a similar problem was previously considered in ref . .",
    "our manuscript is different from ref . in several respects",
    ": we use a different theoretical formulation .",
    "in contrast to ref . , we consider the energy dependent tunneling rates ( in addition to the energy dependence given by fermi functions).we also calculate the dependence of the electric current on the driving frequency .",
    "we find that the regime of strong mechanical feedback , which was discussed in reference , disappears already at weak ac force .",
    "the main effect of the ac force is to create resonances when the external frequency coincides with @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "these resonances can enhance as well as suppress ( anti - resonance ) the current .",
    "we find that in some cases a resonance at @xmath1 can be accompanied by an anti - resonance at @xmath4 and vice versa .",
    "the system we study is an set device coupled to a harmonic oscillator with the frequency @xmath1 , mass @xmath5 and the quality factor @xmath6 .",
    "the most obvious specific realization is a suspended beam ( carbon nanotube ) @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ setup - scheme ] .",
    "the beam is suspended between two leads ; the bias voltage @xmath7 is applied .",
    "the beam thus at the same time is an island where the electron charge is quantized .",
    "the island is capacitively coupled to an underlying gate at which voltage @xmath8 is applied .",
    "this coupling originates from the dependence of the equilibrium position of the oscillator on the charge state of the island and is characterized by the force @xmath9 that acts on the oscillator from the gate electrode when there is an extra electron on it .",
    "the coupling can be quantified by a dimensionless constant @xmath10 , which is the relative shift of the oscillator energy resulting from a single tunnelling event in respect to zero point motion energy .",
    "we assume that oscillator in addition is driven by an external antenna which creates an ac signal with the amplitude @xmath11 and the frequency @xmath12 .",
    "[ scheme ] shows the equivalent circuit : the dot represents the island which is connected to four voltage sources via the capacitances .",
    "we assume that the displacement of the island @xmath13 is much smaller then the distance between the island and the gate electrode @xmath14 and both these distances are smaller then the distance between the island and the antenna @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that the gate capacitance is much bigger than the capacitance between the island and the antenna @xmath17 .",
    "the electrostatic energy of this system in the first order of displacement can be written in the following way , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the charging energy and the induced charge on the island by the electrodes respectively ( @xmath21 is gate capacitance for @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 represents the charge state of the island , and @xmath24 is the force acting on the island from all four electrodes , including the driving force .",
    "charge transfer process at a given @xmath23 is characterized by an energy difference between final and initial state , which is the difference of electrostatic energy given by eq .",

    "what follows , we generalize the treatment of ref . to the case",
    "when the oscillator is ac driven . at weak coupling ,",
    "the motion of the oscillator is classical , and our qualitative evaluation of the electron transport in this regime is based on the master equation for the distribution function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the velocity of the oscillator .",
    "we assume that the bias is low enough so that only two charge states , @xmath23 and @xmath29 , are important for the transport .",

    "the last ones include the external driving force which we choose to be periodic in time .",
    "the `` collision integral '' @xmath34 $ ] consists of two terms : the first representing the set and the second describing interaction of the island with the environment with temperature @xmath35 .",
    "there are four tunnel rates , @xmath36 , where the subscripts @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote tunneling through the left or right junction , and the superscripts @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to the tunneling to and from the island , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ rates2 ] ) @xmath41 .",
    "each rate is a function of the corresponding addition energy @xmath42 associated with the addition / removal of an electron to / from the island .",
    "( 2,2)(1,1 ) ( 151,74.5 )    we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) if we restrict ourselves to the fast tunnelling regime @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is total tunnelling rate , which means that the oscillator coordinate varies so slowly that @xmath45 hardly changes between two successive tunneling events . in this regime",
    "we can apply the adiabatic approximation , arriving to the kramers equation@xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total force @xmath32 excluding the friction force .",
    "coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the following functions of the tunneling rates , @xmath51 here @xmath49 is the diffusion coefficient which contains the term describing the driving of the oscillator by the stochastic force @xmath9 . in further calculation",
    "we assume that environment temperature sets the lowest energy scale in our system , @xmath52 , so that we drop first term in eq .",
    "( [ dif ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath50 is the drift coefficient and if this is positive the corresponding term can be interpreted as a dissipation . for some tunneling rates and sufficiently high quality factors",
    "the drift coefficient can be negative and in this case it gives accumulation of energy .",
    "the third term @xmath48 has a rather trivial effect , it can be included into the oscillator potential energy and just renormalizes the elastic force , not leading to qualitative new effects .",
    "thus we disregard this term in further consideration .    in the single electron transport regime between @xmath23 and @xmath29",
    "the island is subject to the force which is the sum of two terms : the total electric force @xmath24 and the stochastic force @xmath9 due to the stochastic electron transfers events .",
    "the solution of the equation of motion for the oscillator subject to such force can be written in the following way : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is due to the total electric force and is a non - stochastic function obtained from the solution of the equation of motion .",
    "the second term is a stochastic variable which originates from the stochastic force .",
    "if we assume that the quality factor @xmath55 is sufficiently big ( @xmath56 ) and we are out of the resonance ( @xmath57 ) , then the last term can be parameterized by the energy @xmath58 and the phase @xmath59 as follows , @xmath60 .",
    "the master equation can be solved for two limiting cases .",
    "the first is when @xmath61 , dependence of the diffusion and feedback coefficients on @xmath62 can be disregarded . after averaging eq .",

    "this second regime has been studied in ref . .",
    "the stationary distribution function in this regime is given by @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where the angular brackets denote the average over the oscillation period , @xmath72 .",
    "for the entire energy range , whereas we can not solve the kramers equation exactly , we can approximate the solution as follows , @xmath73    the average electric current flowing through the system can be calculated by using this distribution function @xmath74 where @xmath75 using these equations it is possible to calculate the current flowing through the system if we know the energy dependence of the tunneling rates .

    "the linear response of the current on the driving frequency is shown on the figure [ res ] for the different values of the quality factor .",

    "[ res ] shows the current as the function of the driving frequency for the fixed values of voltages ( @xmath86 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "three different panels correspond to the different values of the gate voltage .",
    "thus , by changing the gate voltage it is possible to get either two resonance peaks ( c ) , two anti resonance peaks ( b ) or one resonance and one anti - resonance peaks ( a ) at the resonance frequency and at it s half .",
    "increasing the temperature of transferred electrons causes broadening of coulomb picks and coulomb diamonds .",

    "inset represents temperature dependence of the current for fixed values of applied voltages , which shows that for high temperatures the height of coulomb peak decreases exponentially .",
    "in this article , we studied the behavior of the `` self - detecting '' nems in the regime were it can modeled as a single electron transistor weakly coupled to a harmonic mechanical oscillator . in particular , we studied the dependence of electric current on the external driving frequency .",
    "we demonstrated that current is modified when the system is at the resonance .",
    "we also found that since current can be enhanced by mechanical motion as well as suppressed , depending on the applied voltages , the driving of the resonator can result in the resonance peak ( associated with the current enhancement ) as well as in an antiresonance dip ( associated with the current suppression ) .",
    "additionally , the driving force is proportional contains doubly - oscillating terms , which results in the appearance of an additional resonance peak / dip in the spectrum at the half of the natural frequency @xmath94 . depending on the applied voltages ,",
    "both resonances can be peaks , dips , or one can have a peak and a dip .",
    "the latter situation is realized provided the current is enhanced by mechanical motion at low amplitudes and suppressed at high amplitudes , or vice versa .",
    "the regions of strong backaction discussed in ref . for the system studied above appear to be for high , where the system is not in the single electron tunnelling regime anymore , and our simple analysis can not be applied to this situation .",
    "this article treats the simplest situation  when the oscillator is linear , and the coupling is weak .",
    "experiments @xcite clearly indicate that in certain voltage and power range the resonator can be driven into non - linear and/or strong coupling regime@xcite . with the increase of the driving power",
    "the oscillator enters non - linear regime , and bistabilities and switching effects between states with different amplitude have been experimentally observed .",
    "current response to the external frequency in a non - linear system will have a more complicated form that discussed in this article , in particular , resonances at the frequencies multiple of @xmath95 are expected .",
    "these effects require a more extensive analysis which will be performed elsewhere .",
