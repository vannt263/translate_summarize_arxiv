    "since their publication , the hoava s seminal papers@xcite on a four - dimensional theory of gravity which is power - counting renormalizable and , hence , can be considered a candidate for the short - range ( uv ) completion of the general theory of relativity ( gtr ) , have raised a lot of interest and stimulated an intense research effort on many topics of the theory and its modifications ( a brief review can be found in the recent paper by sotiriou@xcite ) .",
    "hoava s theory admits lifshitz s scale invariance : @xmath7 , and , after this , it is referred to as hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity .",
    "actually , it has anistropic scaling in the uv domain , since it is @xmath8 , while relativistic scaling with @xmath9 is recovered at large distances ( ir ) .    among the other issues , spherically symmetric solutions in hl gravity have been investigated in details@xcite , also in five dimensions@xcite ( as for slowly rotating solutions , see reg . ) ; in particular , kehagias and sfetsos@xcite obtained an asymptotically flat and static spherically symmetric solution that can be considered the analog of schwarzschild solution in gtr .",
    "an open issue in hl theory pertains the role of matter and its coupling to gravity , which has not been clarified in full details . as a consequence ,",
    "the motion of free particles in hl gravity is not trivial : since the fact that particles move along geodesics is not granted , it is possible to expect deviations from geodesic motion@xcite .",
    "however , many authors ( see e.g. ref . and references therein ) assumed that free particles followed geodesics of ks metric to focus on many issues hl gravity , such as gravitational lensing , quasi - normal modes , accretion disks and so on ( moreover , an accurate analysis of ks geodesics can be found in ref . ) .",
    "in other words , they used ks solution as a toy model to study some fundamental aspects of the theory .    in this paper , starting from the same assumption , we aim at constraining the dimensionsless parameter @xmath4 of ks metric . in previous papers@xcite",
    "we obtained bounds both from solar system and extra solar system observations of orbital motions ; other constraints were derived by studying light deflection@xcite and analyzing the impact on the classical gtr tests@xcite . here",
    "we show that tighter results can be obtained by considering the perturbation @xmath0 induced by the ks solution on the two - body range @xmath1 for a pair of test particles a and b orbiting the same central body of mass @xmath2 .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ anale ] , we will analytically work out the perturbation @xmath0 induced by the ks solution on the two - body range @xmath1 , which is a very accurate , direct and unambiguous observable in solar system planetary studies .",
    "we will try to make such a part as more self - consistent as possible , in view of a readership which may not be fully acquainted with the subtleties of celestial mechanics applied to fundamental physics , an endeavor requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across different fields . in this way",
    "the reader has the possibility of following autonomously the future developments of such kind of investigations , and to apply the present approach to other exotic long - range modified models of gravity as well . in section [ osservazioni ]",

    "a step further consists of taking the average of @xmath65 over an orbital period : in doing that we may neglect the terms of order @xmath66 in , but we do not set @xmath16 . the result , exact to @xmath67 , is ( a , e)+.thus , _ 0,according to which a high eccentricity contributes to further strengthen the constraints on @xmath4 .    by applying to the eight major planets of the solar system we have the bounds summarized in table [ tavola ] .",

    "as expected , the tightest constrain comes from mercury , with _ 0 ^ 1.110 ^ -11,which is about @xmath77 times larger than the bound in table 3 of ref .  .",
    "the use of the less accurate would have yielded the weaker constraint _ 0 ^ 8.810 ^ -12 .",
    "however , such a back - to - the - envelope approach can not substitute a more rigorous treatment .",
    "thus , in the following we will compare our predicted results for the ks range perturbation @xmath53 to the post - fit range residuals of some planets produced[multiblock footnote omitted ] with the latest solar system ephemerides@xcite .",
    "as we will see , even tighter constraints will result from such a detailed analysis .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we apply to the system@xcite constituted by the s2 star ( @xmath78 au , @xmath79 ) orbiting the supermassive black hole ( @xmath80 ) located at the center of the galaxy we get _ 0 ^ 810 ^ -10.the bound from would be _ 0 ^ 210 ^ -12 , i.e. 446 times smaller ; this clearly shows how is inadequate for highly eccentric orbits . in order to correctly interpret such result",
    "it should be kept in mind that the ks parameter @xmath4 , contrary to , say , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is not a universal constant of nature ; in general , it may vary from a space - time to another being , thus , connected with the body which acts as source of the gravitational field .    moving to the planetary range residuals , the authors of ref .   processed some radiometric data from the messenger spacecraft during its recent flybys of mercury in 2008 - 2009 with the inpop10a ephemerides ; according to table 1 of ref .",
    ", the resulting mean and standard deviation of the produced range residuals are = -0.61.9  m. in order to constrain @xmath61 from such data we will use the analytical results of section [ anale ] to calculate a time series for @xmath0 with the same numerical characteristics . the result is depicted in figure [ messenger ] :    c    it has been obtained for _",
    "0^= 7.210 ^ -10,and has just = 0.11.9  m. we checked our analytical result by simultaneously integrating the equations of motion of the earth and mercury with and without for the same initial conditions used for producing figure [ messenger ] ; it turns out that the resulting numerically computed ks range signal shows an excellent agreement with the analytical one , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "thus , we can reasonably be confident in our analytical approach . a value for @xmath61 smaller than that in would generate a signal with a larger standard deviation in .",
    "thus , we take the result of as our @xmath83 lower bound on @xmath61 .",
    "it is about two orders of magnitude tighter than the constraint in table 3 of ref .  .",
    "it is also 65 times larger than the naive result of table [ tavola ] .",
    "however , we remark that hl gravity was not modelled at all in the inpop10a ephemerides , which , as usual , only took into account the main well established , standard newtonian and einsteinian effects .",
    "thus , if hl really existed in nature , its signature might have been partially removed by the signal in the estimation of the state vectors during the data reduction process . in other words , there is , in principle , the possibility that @xmath61 may actually be smaller than . as for any other putative exotic models of gravity",
    ", it would be necessary to explicitly include hl in the force models used to process the data and repeat the entire fitting procedure with such a modified dynamical theory : however , such a task is definitely not a trivial one and would require a dedicated analysis by professional teams of astronomers .",
    "it is outside the scopes of the present paper . on the contrary",
    ", the approach outlined here is relatively easy to implement , and can be extended to other modified models of gravity as well .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for mars . indeed",
    ", its range residuals , built with the ephemerides inpop10a and the data of the mars global surveyor ( mgs ) spacecraft over a time span 10 yr long ( 1998 - 2008 ) , yield@xcite = 0.51.9  m. figure [ mgs ] displays the analytically computed ks range signal over the same time interval for _",
    "0^ = 910 ^ -12 .",
    "c    it turns out that = 0.32  m.a numerical integration confirms such features , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the constraint of is 64 times larger than the approximate one in table [ tavola ] . with respect to table 3 of ref .  , is more stringent by three orders of magnitude .",
    "another planet whose orbit s knowledge has greatly been improved in recent years thanks to the continuous radiometric ranging to the cassini spacecraft is saturn .",
    "the range residuals over 3 years ( 2004 - 2007 ) produced with the inpop10a ephemerides@xcite yield = 0.017  m.figure [ cassini ] depicts the analytically computed ks range perturbation for _",
    "0^= 1.710 ^ -12 :    c    it has = 0.717  m.also in this case , a numerical integration fully confirms the characteristics of the analytical signal of figure [ cassini ] .",
    "the constraint of is about four orders of magnitude tighter than that in table [ tavola ] , and six orders of magnitude better than table 4 in ref .  :",
    "cfr . with the much smaller deviations in the case of mercury and",
    "mars amounting to about one order of magnitude .",
    "it is likely so because the radiometric data from the inner planets played a major role in the estimation of the sun s gravitational parameter@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the solar system constraints on @xmath61 obtained in the present paper are more stringent than those derived by the authors of ref .   through the light deflection , and by the authors of ref .   from the orbital motion of mercury , the deflection of light by the sun , and the radar echo delays .",
    "in view of the fact that ranging from the earth to some major bodies of the solar system is one of the most direct and accurate way to determine their orbits , in this paper we analytically worked out the effects that the kehagias - sfetsos solution of the hoava - lifshitz modified gravity at long distances have on the two - body range @xmath1 .",
    "we successfully checked our analytical results by simultaneously integrating the equations of motion of the bodies a and b considered by including such exotic dynamical effects as well .    by comparing our predictions with the range - residuals @xmath3 of mercury ,",
    "mars and saturn produced with the recent ephemerides inpop10a we have been able to effectively constrain the dimensionless free parameter @xmath4 entering the kehagias - sfetsos equations in the case of the sun .",
    "we obtained @xmath5 .",
    "such constraints are orders of magnitude better than those existing in literature .    in principle , one should re - process the entire planetary data set by explicitly modeling the kehagias - sfetsos dynamical effects in addition to the standard newtonian - einsteinian ones and solving for a dedicated parameter in order to avoid the possibility that they , if unmodeled , may be removed from the signal in the estimation of the initial conditions .",
    "however , such a task is very time - consuming and can effectively be implemented only by skilful and expert teams of specialists in astronomical data processing . on the other hand , the relatively simpler approach outlined here can be easily and quickly reproduced , and extended to other exotic long - range modified models of gravity as well in order to yield reasonable evaluations of the magnitude of the effects of interest .",
