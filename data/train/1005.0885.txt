    "<S> we introduce a first principles approach to determine the strength of the electronic correlations based on the fully self consistent gw approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the approach provides a seamless interface with dynamical mean field theory , and gives good results for well studied correlated materials such as nio . </S>",
    "<S> applied to the recently discovered iron arsenide materials , it accounts for the noticeable correlation features observed in optics and photoemission while explaining the absence of visible satellites in x - ray absorption experiments and other high energy spectroscopies .    </S>",
    "<S> many metals , semiconductors , and insulators are well described by the `` standard model '' of solid state physics . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the excitations are band electrons , and their dispersion can be computed quantitatively in perturbation theory starting from the density functional theory using the gw method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when this standard model fails , we talk about strongly correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of strong correlations is debated with each new material discovery , as for example in the context of the iron pnictide superconductors . on the experimental side , controversies arose because optical experiments revealed significant mass renormalizations @xcite while xray absorption , core level spectroscopies and resonant inelastic xray scattering indicated the absence of satellite peaks @xcite , which are standard fingerprints of strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> photoemission studies indicate that the overall bandwidth is narrowed by a factor of two @xcite but substantially larger mass renormalizations are present near the fermi level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar controversies arose within the first principles approaches to the treatment of correlations with some theoretical studies supporting the notion of weak correlations @xcite , while others advocate a more correlated picture @xcite . to make progress on this </S>",
    "<S> issues one needs to develop fully ab initio tools for addressing the problem of determining the strength of correlations and test their predictions against experiments .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new first principles methodology for evaluating the strength of the correlations based on the self - consistent gw method . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been shown to predict accurate total energy  @xcite , and we expect to obtain reliable estimates for the interaction strength since this quantity can be thought as a second derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation of the correlated orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we test successfully the method on the well studied example of a correlated material nio , and then we apply it to a prototypical iron pnictide bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correlations in iron pnictides are strong , as pointed out in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but unlike earlier studies our ab - initio method accounts for the absence of well defined hubbard bands in the spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> our results are thus in excellent agreement with experiment and reconcile the results of apparently conflicting spectroscopies .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the one - particle electron green s function in the solid , @xmath1 , which is measurable in photoemission experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we split it into @xmath2 , where @xmath3 describes the non - interacting system of electrons , and @xmath4 is the frequency dependent self - energy . both @xmath1 and @xmath4 are matrices in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons interact among themselves via the coulomb interaction @xmath6 , however , the mobile electrons screen it and is therefore useful to reformulate the problem in terms of a screened coulomb interaction @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 @xcite where @xmath9 is the exact polarization function .    dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) </S>",
    "<S> maps the many body problem in the solid to that of a correlated _ atomic _ shell embedded in an effective medium . </S>",
    "<S> the medium is described by an energy dependent weiss field @xmath10 , which obeys the following equation @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the local green s function and the local self - energy , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the electrons in the renormalized atom feel an effective retarded coulomb interaction @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> just like the weiss field @xmath15 of the atom reflects the delocalizing effect of the medium at the single particle level , the weiss field @xmath14 captures the screening of the interaction due to the presence of the other atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the weiss field at the two particle level @xmath14 obeys the following relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the local polarization function and the local screened interaction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bare local propagators @xmath19 and bare interaction @xmath14 are chosen so as to give the exact @xmath12 and @xmath18 when all the local feynman diagrams are summed up . </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g0eq ] ) and ( [ ueq ] ) are a version of the extended - dmft equations studied for simplified models in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of this work is to use this approach to estimate the correlation strength in the solid , and illustrate the power of the method by a practical realistic self - consistent implementation .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach shares ideas with other methods to compute the local interaction matrix @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> like constrained lda , it defines correlations on a correlated _ orbital_. it adopts the philosophy of the constrained rpa method @xcite , which divides the _ bands _ into a set that belongs to the low energy model , and the rest of the bands , which contribute to screening . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of the bands , our method uses orbitals to divide the polarization operator of the lattice into a local part , involving the correlated orbital , and the rest , which screens the local interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the steps required for the practical implementation of the method and its interface with lda+dmft @xcite : i ) we perform a _ fully self consistent _ gw calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) we evaluate @xmath21 and @xmath22 using the projector @xmath23 , defined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 is the atom index and @xmath27 is the angular momentum index . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) we evaluate @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ueq ] ) to evaluate @xmath14 , which we now denote by @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) we also evaluate the hybridization function @xmath31 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g0eq ] ) and identity @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 contains the coupling of the correlated orbitals to the valence states of the system @xmath34 , and to the semicore states @xmath35 , and can thus be represented as @xmath36}/{(i\\omega-\\varepsilon)}$ ] . in lda+dmft </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization to these semicore state is eliminated resulting in @xmath37 , which is connected to gw hybridization by @xmath38 where @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this factor is then absorbed by rescaling of the field @xmath40 and consequently the interaction matrix used in the lda+dmft calculation becomes @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this renormalization is usually very small , and in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use this fully ab initio method to determine the interaction matrix strength @xmath30 and the occupancy of the @xmath43 orbital @xmath44 , which fixes the double - counting correction of lda+dmft . with this input , </S>",
    "<S> the lda+dmft method becomes a fully ab - initio method .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective interaction obtained with this method is a general symmetric tensor with four indices @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to inquire to which extent this interaction can be approximated in terms of slater integrals @xmath46 , where @xmath47 runs over @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal determination of this parameters is done with the projector @xmath49 here @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the projection is excellent and can be seen by recomputing the coulomb repulsion from the slater integrals and comparing the resulting @xmath53 with the full @xmath20 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we mention in passing that the naive hartree - fock like estimation of slater integrals @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , can lead to a substantial underestimation of slater integrals .    </S>",
    "<S> we first test our method in an arc - typical charge transfer insulator nio . </S>",
    "<S> we get the following static values of the slater integrals @xmath57ev , @xmath58ev , and @xmath59ev . </S>",
    "<S> if the hund s parameter @xmath60 is computed from @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) we get @xmath63ev ( @xmath64ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> when these parameter are used in lda+dmft , the agreement between the theory and experiment is very good @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we mention in passing that when the gw screened interaction and polarization are computed from the lda kohn - sham states ( non self - consistent gw ) we get slightly smaller interaction strength @xmath65ev .    </S>",
    "<S> next we turn to the coulomb repulsion in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ u_b122](a ) and ( b ) show the frequency dependence of the slater integrals for fe-@xmath66 orbitals on imaginary frequency axis in linear and log scale , respectively . at very high frequency , the interaction is unscreened and approaches its atomic value . </S>",
    "<S> the density - density coulomb interaction @xmath67 is strongly screened in the solid , while the higher multipoles @xmath61 and @xmath62 are much less energy dependent , and almost equal in solid as in the atom .    the static coulomb interaction @xmath67 is estimated to be no less then @xmath68ev , larger then previously estimated by constrained lda  @xcite and constrained rpa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we want to remark that the self - consistency of gw is important in this material , because the non - self consistent version of gw leads to weaker interaction strength @xmath69ev .    </S>",
    "<S> the higher order multipoles @xmath61 and @xmath62 show only a weak frequency dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the highest multipole @xmath62 is less screened then @xmath61 , and hence a single number @xmath60 does not parameterize the form of the hund s coupling very well , as @xmath70 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ u_b122](c ) . finally fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ u_b122](d ) shows that the slater parametrization of the gw coulomb interaction is remarkably accurate in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , with error less then 6% .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the spectral properties of the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> earlier 5-band model lda+dmft calculations @xcite displayed important mass renormalization at low energies ( @xmath71 ) , but also showed a sharp lower hubbard band . </S>",
    "<S> we now perform computations by newly implemented charge self - consistent lda+dmft(ctqmc ) method , based on wien2k  @xcite , and explained in detail in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the gw estimate for the slater integrals , renormalized by @xmath72 due to elimination of the hybridization with semicore states , are @xmath73ev , @xmath74ev and @xmath75ev . </S>",
    "<S> we use the standard localized limit double - counting , which gives for the valence @xmath76 , in perfect agreement with gw estimate @xmath77 , hence there is no uncertainty in appropriateness of the chosen double - counting correction . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle mass renormalization obtained by dmft is @xmath78 for lighter @xmath79 and @xmath80 orbitals and @xmath81 for heavier @xmath82 and @xmath83 orbitals .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aopt](a ) we plot the spectral function @xmath84 along the path shown in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> there are three circular hole pockets at @xmath85 and two electron pockets at @xmath86 , in agreement with arpes @xcite and lda . </S>",
    "<S> the two smaller pockets are degenerate and their crossing occurs at @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in good agreement with arpes @xcite , where the pocket size was estimated to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi velocities at @xmath85 point towards @xmath91 , predicted by our method , are @xmath92 , more then twice smaller then in lda . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity is in reasonable agreement with experiment where somewhat different velocities for the two pockets are estimated to be @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also overlay the arpes intensity from ref .   on our spectral dispersion to emphasize good agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity is also a strong test of the correlation strength , as pointed out in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the strong reduction of drude weight and the presence of mid - infrared peak at @xmath95ev was noticed in refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aopt](b ) we show optics obtained by lda and by dmft , and we compare it to experimental results of refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> although lda gives a reasonable order of magnitude for optics , it clearly disagrees with experiments in strength of the drude peak ( @xmath96ev ) and position of the mid - infrared peak , coming from the interband transitions . in contrary </S>",
    "<S> our dmft results give smaller drude peak of strength @xmath97ev , in very favorable agreement with experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice similar width of the drude peak in dmft and experiments , which shows that the most important channel for scattering in this material is the electron - electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the position of the mid - infrared peak , which lda predicts at frequency @xmath98ev , appears around @xmath99ev in dmft , in very favorable agreement with experiment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to demonstrate the sensitivity of the optical conductivity to the strength of the correlations , we carried out lda+dmft calculation using parameters of ref .  , @xmath100ev , @xmath101ev , and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting quasiparticle renormalization amplitude is @xmath103 , in very good agreement with results of ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aopt](b ) we show optical conductivity thus obtained with label dmft - w . </S>",
    "<S> we noticed that neither drude peak weight ( @xmath104ev ) nor the position of the mid - infrared peak ( @xmath105ev ) is in good agreement with experiments , thus confirming that bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 should not be regarded as weakly correlated material .    finally , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aopt](c ) shows the temperature dependence of optical conductivity as obtained by dmft . </S>",
    "<S> while the interband transitions are roughly temperature independent , the drude peak width and strength is temperature dependent , substantially sharpening at @xmath106k compared to @xmath107k , which is the consequence of the coherence incoherence crossover in this temperature range , discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dos-122](a ) show the total density of states ( dos ) and fe-@xmath66 partial dos . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( b ) shows the as-@xmath108 partial dos . comparing lda+dmft partial dos to lda partial dos </S>",
    "<S> , we notice that apart from the renormalization of the low energy quasi - particles , and broadening of the high energy features , there is only little difference between lda and lda+dmft momentum averaged spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with x - ray absorption spectroscopy @xcite , where good agreement between lda and the experiments was pointed out . given the strong correlation effects present in optics and low energy arpes , it is unusual that no clear hubbard - like satellites of the atomic like @xmath109 state can be identified in local density of states . the dmft valence histogram @xcite , describing the probability of finding each fe-@xmath66 atomic configuration in the solid as a function of the renormalized energy of the atomic state sheds light on the unusual metallic state of the iron pnictides . in a weakly correlated metal , almost all the atomic configurations are significantly present in the ground state of the solid and their energy vary over the scale of the hybridization which represents the bandwidth of the metal . in correlated oxides , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> only a few atomic states in each valence have substantial weight , which results in sharp hubbard bands . in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the atomic ground state with valence @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 is only 0.014 , 0.01 , and 0.007 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> other states have smaller probability , but remarkably _ all _ atomic states with valence 5 , 6 , and 7 have finite probability larger then 0.001 . </S>",
    "<S> the large occupancy of the extremely large number of atomic configurations is reminiscent of an itinerant system . on the other hand , unlike the weakly correlated situation , the spread of the multiplets of the @xmath112 states , ( coming from the slater integrals @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) is @xmath113ev similarly the atomic states with @xmath110 span an energy range of @xmath114ev . </S>",
    "<S> this scale , represents the width of the hubbard bands and is very large , much larger than the scale of the hybridization ( @xmath115ev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the absence of clear atomic - like satellite excitations is not due to weak correlations in feas materials , as suggested in refs .  , </S>",
    "<S> but rather due to the strength of the atomic multiplet splittings and due to the broad bandwidth of the highly polarizable as states . </S>",
    "<S> this situation , arises for the parameters determined from the self consistent gw method . </S>",
    "<S> it is significantly different from what is found in the oxides , and is captured by the charge self - consistent lda+dmft calculation . </S>"
