    "the possibility to simulate graphene - like structures and investigate the physics of dirac points with ultra cold atoms in optical lattices is attracting an increasing interest in the literature @xcite .",

    "the same experiment has also been interpreted by means of an universal tight - binding hamiltonian defined on a _ square _ lattice @xcite , that describes the merging of dirac points and the corresponding topological transition between a semi - metallic phase and a band insulator @xcite .",
    "though this model remarkably captures all the relevant physics , its connection with the optical lattice parameters is indirect and has some limitations , as it relies on a fit of the parameters of the universal hamiltonian to the two lowest lying energy bands in the vicinity of the dirac cones @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive scheme based on composite maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) @xcite for constructing an _ ab initio _ tight - binding model corresponding to the _ tunable honeycomb _ potential with two minima per unit cell as described in ref .",
    "the mlwfs are obtained by means of a gauge transformation that minimizes their real space spread , and are routinely employed in condensed matter physics @xcite . as recently demonstrated ,",
    "these functions represent also an optimal tool for constructing tight - binding models for ultra cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , as they allow for an optimized mapping of the system hamiltonian onto the discrete model defined on a lattice .",
    "they allow for an ab initio calculation of the tight - binding parameters , with a fine control over next to leading corrections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mlwf ] , we review the general approach for mapping a continuous many - body hamiltonian onto a discrete tight - binding model by means of mlwfs . in section [ sec : honeycomb ] we apply this scheme in the tunable two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of ref .",
    "@xcite , discussing the general structure of the associated bravais lattice in direct and reciprocal space , and presenting the tight - binding expansion up to the third - nearest neighbors . here",
    "we also give explicit numerical results for the calculated mlwfs , the inferred tunneling coefficients and the bloch band structure .",
    "then , in section iv , we make use of the tight - binding hamiltonian in reciprocal space - expressed in terms of tunneling coefficients and functions depending on the geometry of the associated lattice - for discussing the behavior of the dirac points as a function of the lattice parameters .",
    "there , we also discuss the dispersion relation close to the merging of dirac points , refining and improving the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", we discuss the effect of parity breaking , that destroys the degeneracy of the two potential minima , providing a finite dirac mass . some accessory but important details are included in the appendices , covering the tight - binding expansion , the gauge dependence of the results , and the numerical application .",

    "we consider the mlwfs for composite bands ( n@xmath171 ) since we are interested in geometries where the wigner - seitz cell has a non trivial basis .",
    "this allows each mlwf to be centered on a single potential minimum inside the elementary cell , in contrast to single - band wannier functions @xcite . for this work ,",
    "the mlwfs have been computed by means of the wannier90 code @xcite and a modified version of the quantum - espresso package @xcite adapted to the case of an optical lattice @xcite .",

    "furthermore , if all the terms in the sum are retained , owing to the following formula valid for an infinite lattice @xmath147 one easily recovers the exact diagonal expression @xmath148 .",
