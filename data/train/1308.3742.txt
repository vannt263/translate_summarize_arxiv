    "the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) of relativistic particles ( krymsky @xcite , axford et al .",
    "@xcite , bell @xcite , blandford & ostriker @xcite ) is generally accepted as the most likely paradigm for production of galactic cosmic rays ( cr ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . over the last 30 years a significant progress has been achieved in the development of theoretical models and understanding of the basic features of dsa ( see e.g. malkov & drury @xcite , schure et al .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . on the other hand",
    ", the recent detailed studies of spectral and morphological features of young snrs , first of all in the x - ray and very - high - energy ( or tev ) gamma - ray band , provide excellent observational material for development of detailed numerical models of acceleration and radiation of relativistic electrons and protons in young snrs .",
    "these observations generally confirm in general terms the predictions of dsa .",
    "in particular the synchrotron x - radiation observed from several young snrs implies an existence of multi - tev electrons which is naturally explained by dsa .",
    "the detection of tev gamma - rays from snrs , like cas  a , rx j1713.7 - 3946 , vela jr .",
    ", rcw  86 ( see hinton & hofmann @xcite ; rieger et al .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) give a more direct and unambiguous information about the effective acceleration of particles , electrons and/or protons , in snrs to energies exceeding 100 tev .",
    "in this paper we conduct detailed study of acceleration of electrons and protons with an emphasis on the spectral and morphological features of high energy radiation produced by these particles in the young supernova remnant cas  a. for that purpose we use a new numerical code of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by one of us in collaboration with v. ptuskin ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) .",
    "this model can be considered as a natural development of existing numerical codes ( see e.g. berezhko et al.@xcite , kang et al @xcite ) , with new additional elements which despite their strong impact on the overall picture of acceleration in general , and on the properties of high energy radiation of snrs in particular , have been ignored in the past .",
    "namely , in our treatment , the solution of spherically symmetric hydrodynamic equations is combined with the transport and acceleration of relativistic particles by the _",
    "forward _ shock and _ reverse _ shocks ( fs and rs , respectively ) .",
    "the nonlinear response of energetic particles via their pressure gradient results in a self - regulation of acceleration efficiency .",
    "the detailed calculations of radio , x - ray , gamma - ray emission components conducted within a self - consistent treatment of the particle acceleration by both forward and reverse shocks should allow a direct comparison of the observed spectral and morphological features with model predictions .",
    "the inclusion of the radiation components related to the reverse shock seems to be a rather obligatory condition , at least for the specific case of cas  a. in this regard we note that the parameters that characterize the reverse shock can be significantly different compared to the parameters of the forward shock .",
    "therefore , the properties of radiation components from the reverse and forward shocks are also expected to be significantly different . in particular",
    ", the magnetic field in the reverse shock can be very small which would dramatically increase the contribution of the ic component compared to the hadronic ( @xmath3-decay ) component of gamma - rays . because of the stronger magnetic field , in the forward shock just opposite relation is expected between the contributions of electrons and protons to production of high energy gamma - rays .    an interesting feature of cas  a is the non - negligible contribution of the decay of radioactive elements in the ejecta to the production of suprathermal electrons and positrons as a potentially important `` injection material '' .",
    "the acceleration of these particles by the reverse shock ( zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite , ellison et al .",
    "@xcite ) can result in a rather high energy content of leptonic component in snrs .",
    "in particular this can explain the high electron to proton ratio found in cas  a ( atoyan et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the results and conclusion of this study have a rather general character and can be applied to different snrs . in this paper",
    "the model is used to interpret the multi - wavelength properties of cas a - one of the youngest supernova remnants in our galaxy .",
    "the high quality x - ray images and energy spectra , as well as the coverage of gamma - ray observations from low to very high energies , provide adequate observational material to conduct detailed theoretical studies of acceleration and radiation processes in this unique source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize multi - wavelength observations of cas a. the short description of the model is given in section 3 .",
    "the results of modeling of the broad - band emission are presented and discussed in sections 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 .",
    "finally , in sections 8 and 9 we discuss and summarize the obtained results .",
    "the supernova explosion related to cas  a is likely to be linked to the event observed by flamsteed in 1680 ( ashworth @xcite ) .",
    "recently krause et al .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of its light echo with a spectrum similar to the spectra of iib supernova 1993j .",
    "therefore one may assume that snr cas a was produced in a iib type supernova explosion . generally , the progenitors of such explosions are red super giants ( rsg ) which already have lost their hydrogen envelope via a powerful stellar wind ( chevalier @xcite ) .",
    "cas a has been extensively observed at radio wavelengths ( bell et al .",

    "@xcite ; etc . ) .",
    "the radio spectrum is close to power - law @xmath4 with a spectral index @xmath5 ( baars et al .",
    "the main fraction of radio - emission comes from the bright radio - ring with an angular radius close to @xmath6 and from the faint outer radio - plateau with an angular radius @xmath7 . for a distance to the source @xmath8 kpc ( reed et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the corresponding spatial radii are 1.7 pc and 2.5 pc , respectively .",
    "in addition to the large - scale structures , several hundreds of very compact and bright radio - knots with steeper spectra ( anderson et al .",
    "@xcite ) are present in the radio - shell .",
    "it is believed that the bright radio - ring is related to the reverse shock propagating into the supernova ejecta .",
    "a large number of fast - moving knots ( fmk ) are observed also in optics ( e.g. fesen et al .",
    "@xcite ) are attributed to densest clumps of ejecta which are not strongly decelerated after the supernova explosion .",
    "this hypothesis agrees with x - ray observations which show that the x - ray line emitting shell roughly coincides with the bright radio ring .",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma is rich in o , si , ar , ca and fe dominated by the contribution from oxygen ( fabian et al . @xcite ; markert et al .",
    "@xcite ; vink et al .",
    "@xcite , hughes et al . @xcite ; willingale et al .",
    "@xcite ; hwang & laming @xcite ; laming & hwang @xcite ) .",
    "besides the line x - ray emission , cas a shows a hard x - ray continuum extending up to 100  kev with a photon index @xmath9 as measured by _ bepposax _ ( vink et al .",
    "@xcite ) , _ integral _ ( renaud et al .",
    "@xcite ) and _ suzaku _ observations ( maeda et al .",
    "@xcite ) satellites . unfortunately , because of limited angular resolution of these instruments , the production region(s ) of the component of radiation can not be localized . at low energies ,",
    "thin and faint nonthermal x - ray filamentary structures have been found at the periphery of the remnant close to the boundary of the radio plateau ( gotthelf et al .",
    "these filaments correspond to the position of the forward shock propagating in the circumstellar medium .",
    "the proper motion of these filaments has been measured by the _",
    "chandra _ observations allowing the estimate of the forward shock velocity of about 4900 km s@xmath10 ( patnaude & fesen @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the inner shell in the radio and x - ray images can be naturally attributed to the reverse shock propagating in the supernova ejecta , assuming that the electrons are accelerated also at the reverse shock ( uchiyama & aharonian @xcite , helder & vink @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the reverse shock is not treated as an efficient accelerator , because the magnetic field of ejecta might be very weak due to the large expansion factor of the exploded star .",
    "however , similar to the case of the forward shock , the magnetic field can be significantly amplified also at the reverse shock ( see ellison et al .",
    "@xcite ) , for example , in the course of the nonresonant streaming instability as suggested by bell @xcite .",
    "this implies that we should expect gamma - rays from both forward and reverse shocks the contributions of which however can not be separated by current gamma - ray telescopes both in gev and tev energy bands",
    ".    very high energy gamma - ray emission from cas  a has been discovered by the hegra system of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and later confirmed by the magic ( albert et al .",
    "@xcite ) and veritas ( acciari et al .",
    "@xcite ) collaborations .",
    "the fluxes published by three groups are in a reasonably good agreement with each other , and indicate on a not - very - hard and not - very - soft energy spectrum with a photon index @xmath11 and a maximal energy of detected photons 5 tev .    at low energies , a weak gamma - rays signal from cas",
    "a has been discovered after the first year of observations with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( abdo et al .",
    "while the flux and the energy spectrum reported at energies above 0.5  gev are quite informative for constraining certain model parameters , they are not sufficient for a robust conclusions concerning , in particular , the origin of radiation . in this regard , the derivation of the energy spectrum at energies below 1 gev seems to be crucial for identification of the radiation mechanism(s ) . in particular , a sharp decline of the spectrum below 1  gev would indicate the dominance of hadronic interactions , at least in this energy band .",
    "motivated by the importance of such spectral measurements , we attempted to reanalyze the _ fermi _ lat data based on much larger statistics accumulated over 4  yr observations , and using the recent _ fermi _ lat software package which allows the extension of the analysis down to 100  mev .",
    "the approach used in this paper for analysis of the _ fermi _ lat data is described in @xcite .",
    "we have selected the events with energy between 60  mev and 100gev and applied the usual filters recommended by the _ fermi _",
    "lat collaboration ( removing the intervals when the rocking angle of the lat was greater than 52  deg or when parts of the region - of - interest ( roi ) were observed at zenith angles larger than 100  deg ) . to derive the energy spectrum we applied the maximum likelihood method in 13 independent energy bins from 100  mev to 100  gev",
    "; the galactic and isotropic diffuse emission was modeled using the tools _",
    "gal-2years7v6-v0 _ and _ iso - p7v6source_. during the broad - band fit , all sources in the second fermi catalog ( 2fgl ) in the field of view have been included in likelihood model .",
    "points with significance of more than 3@xmath12 are shown in fig .",
    "6 , 7,8 and 14 .",
    "it should be noted that below 200  mev , the spectrum determination suffers heavily from the background subtraction due to the uncertainties in the model of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "applying different models generated by the galprop simulator , we obtained a 15 % larger flux that can be account by systematic errors .",
    "the obtained spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shows a significant decrease of the flux below 1 gev which is expected in the sed of gamma - rays from decays of neutral pions produced at interactions of accelerated protons and nuclei with the ambient gas .",
    "throughout this paper we use the approach which lies on a nonlinear treatment of particle acceleration by strong shock waves proposed by zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite .",
    "non - steady hydrodynamical equations for the gas density @xmath13 , gas velocity @xmath14 , gas pressure @xmath15 , and the equation for the quasi - isotropic cr momentum distribution @xmath16 in the spherically symmetrical case are solved numerically with the use of a finite - difference method .",
    "thermal protons are injected at the forward shock with a radius @xmath17 . since it is believed that the ejecta material in cas a consists mainly on heavy elements , the oxygen ions are injected at the reverse shock with a radius @xmath18 .",
    "the injection efficiency that is the fraction of particles injected into dsa at the reverse and forward shocks @xmath19 and @xmath20 is taken to be independent of time , and the injection momenta are @xmath21 , @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass of the proton and oxygen ion respectively .",
    "we normalize the momentum distribution of oxygen ions @xmath25 to the number density of nucleons .",
    "thus the number density of oxygen ions with atomic mass @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .    to obtain the sub - shock compression ratio close to 2.5 - 2.7 , for simulations of cosmic ray modified shocks",
    "we adopt the injection efficiency @xmath28 .",
    "this is in agreement with calculations of quasi - parallel collisionless shocks ( zirakashvili @xcite ) and is supported by radio - observations of young extragalactic ib / c snrs ( chevalier & fransson @xcite ) . the amplified magnetic field is rather large in these snrs and the synchrotron radio - emission is produced by electrons with energies below 1 gev . the observed radio - flux @xmath29 has a power - law dependence on the frequency @xmath30 .",
    "note that since the radiative losses of radio electrons are negligible , this corresponds to a @xmath31 type energy spectrum of accelerated electrons .",
    "such a spectrum can be formed at the sub - shock with a compression ratio 2.5 .    in older remnants ,",
    "the magnetic field strength drops and the energy spectra of gev electrons become flatter due to the higher compression ratio `` seen '' by these particles .",
    "this change of the electron energy distribution is reflected in the spectrum of radio emission    in snr shells the ion injection may be suppressed at oblique shocks ( see vlk et al .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of this topic ) .",
    "this can be realized in cas a where the forward shock propagates in the stellar wind with an azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "that is why below we consider two extreme cases with @xmath32 ( hadronic model ) and @xmath33 ( leptonic model ) .",
    "usually the pressure of energetic electrons is neglected , i.e. the electrons are treated as test particles . however , recently it has been proposed that gamma - rays from the radioactive decay of @xmath34ni may produce a large number of energetic electrons via compton scattering in the circumstellar medium .",
    "in addition the decays of @xmath2ti can directly supply energetic electrons and positrons in supernova ejecta ( see zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite for details ) .",
    "these energetic particles are further accelerated by the forward and reverse shocks . under these conditions , the reverse shock may be modified by the pressure of electrons ( positrons ) . for this reason in calculations",
    "we include the contribution of relativistic electrons to the overall pressure .",
    "the evolution of electron distribution is described by an equation similar to transport equation for protons , but with additional terms describing synchrotron , coulomb , bremsstrahlung and ic losses . in the scenario of electron injection through the decays of radioactive nuclei @xmath34ni and @xmath2ti ,",
    "the amount of positrons and electrons injected at the forward and reverse shock is described by the injection efficiencies @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . for the forward shock",
    "the injection efficiency is determined by the probability of appearance of an energetic electron due to the compton scattering of gamma - rays from @xmath34co decay and is given by ( zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite )    @xmath37    here @xmath38 is the mass of @xmath34ni just after the explosion and @xmath39 is the distance from the center of the remnant expressed in parsecs .",
    "@xmath34co is produced via decay of @xmath34ni .    for the reverse shock",
    "the injection efficiency of electrons and positrons produced directly from the decay of @xmath2ti can be written as ( zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite )    @xmath40    here @xmath41 is the mass of ejecta , @xmath42 is the mass of @xmath2ti just after the explosion , and @xmath43 yr is the half - time of @xmath2ti .",
    "it was taken into account that one electron and 0.94 positrons appear per a decay of @xmath2ti .",
    "cr diffusion is determined by magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "strong streaming of accelerated particles changes medium properties in the shock vicinity .",
    "in particular , the cr streaming instability in young snrs results in a high level of magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence ( bell @xcite ) and even in the amplification of magnetic field ( bell @xcite ) . due to this effect protons can be accelerated to energies beyond the the so - called lagage and cesarsky upper limit , @xmath44  tev ( lagage & cesarsky @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field amplified upstream the shock is enhanced further via compression in the shock transition region .",
    "it can even play a dynamical role downstream of the shock .",
    "we take magnetic pressure and magnetic energy flux into account downstream of the shock .",
    "this is a new element in comparison with the approach of zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite where the magnetic field spatial distribution was prescribed .",
    "the magnetic field was transported in the downstream region as the gas with adiabatic index @xmath45 .",
    "its impact on the shock dynamics was also taken into account via hugoniot conditions .",
    "upstream of the forward shock where dynamical effects of the magnetic fields are small , the coordinate dependence of the magnetic field @xmath46 can be prescribed as : @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the undisturbed gas density at the shock position and the density of the medium where the shock propagates respectively , @xmath50 is the speed of the forward shock .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is similar to the alfvn much number of the shock and determines the value of the amplified magnetic field strength far upstream of the shock . in the shock transition region",
    "the magnetic field strength is increased by a factor of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the shock compression ratio .",
    "an expression similar to eq .",
    "( 3 ) is used also in the upstream region of the reverse shock .",
    "below we use the adiabatic index of isotropic random magnetic field @xmath54 . for this value of the adiabatic index",
    "the magnetic pressure @xmath55 is three times smaller than the magnetic energy density ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "cr advective velocity may differ from the gas velocity by the value of the radial component of the alfvn velocity @xmath57 calculated in the isotropic random magnetic field : @xmath58 .",
    "the factor @xmath59 describes the possible deviation of the cosmic ray drift velocity from the gas velocity .",
    "we use values @xmath60 and @xmath61 upstream of the forward and reverse shocks respectively , where alfvn waves are generated by the cosmic ray streaming instability and propagate in the corresponding directions .",
    "the damping of these waves heats the gas upstream of the shocks ( see mckenzie & vlk @xcite ) and limits the total compression ratios of cr modified shocks . in the downstream region of the forward and reverse shock at @xmath62 we put @xmath63 and therefore @xmath64 .",
    "we use the diffusion coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the forward and reverse shocks in the following form @xmath67 were @xmath68 is the bohm diffusion coefficient . since it is expected that the highest energy particles are scattered by small - scale magnetic fields generated in the course of the non - resonant streaming instability , their diffusion coefficient is larger than the bohm diffusion coefficient and is proportional to @xmath69 ( dolginov & toptygin @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is described by the second term in parenthesis where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the momenta which separate these two different regimes of diffusion .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 describes the possible deviations of diffusion coefficient from the one achieved in the regime of bohm diffusion at small energies .",
    "it is expected that @xmath73 because small energy particles can be resonantly scattered only by a fraction of the magnetic spectrum . throughout the paper",
    "we use the value @xmath74 . note that at high energies the particle diffusion is determined by the small - scale magnetic fields , and the values of @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) are adjusted to reproduce the gamma and x - ray observations ( see below ) .",
    "therefore the results of calculations do not strongly depend on the chosen value of @xmath74 .    in real situations",
    "the level of mhd turbulence drops with distance upstream the shock , so the diffusion could be quite fast there .",
    "the characteristic diffusive scale of highest energy particles is a small fraction ( @xmath76 ) of the shock radius ( see zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) , and is determined by the generation and transport of mhd turbulence in the upstream region . the value @xmath77 is determined by the ratio of diffusion coefficient @xmath78 in the circumstellar medium and diffusion coefficient @xmath79 in the vicinity of the shock .",
    "the mhd turbulence is amplified exponentially in time before the shock arrival from the background level by the cosmic ray streaming instability .",
    "this process is not modeled in the present study ; we simply multiply the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath80 to the additional factor @xmath81 upstream the forward shock and to a similar factor @xmath82 upstream the reverse shock .",

    "the maximum energy of protons @xmath234 40 tev in the hadronic model h1 is in agreement with previous estimates of maximum energies attainable at fast shocks with non - resonant streaming instability ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite , bell et al .",

    "generally , the high - energy part of the observed spectrum is well reproduced in the leptonic model l1 ( see figure 8)",
    ". however the low energy part of the spectrum below 1 gev contributed by non - thermal bremsstrahlung of electrons , does not agree with _ fermi _ lat data .    to avoid overproduction of the non - thermal bremsstrahlung , in the hadronic model h1",
    "we assume that the magnetic field at the reverse shock is rather large .",
    "it is interesting that this is possible only due to the presence of the rsg shell .",
    "as mentioned in section 8.1 , this shell results in an effective transfer of the explosion energy in the reverse shock region and in a stronger magnetic field . because of the lack of such a shell in the hadronic model h2 , the energetics of the reverse shock is low , and the magnetic field is rather weak .",
    "therefore , the number of relativistic electrons must be very high to reproduce the radio flux observed from the reverse shock .",
    "then , the non - thermal bremsstrahlung produced by same electrons might significantly exceed the gamma - ray flux observed at sub - gev energies ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the hadronic models demand strong amplification of the magnetic field in order to reproduce the shape of the observed broad - band energy spectra of gamma - rays . for the model h1 ,",
    "the required upstream values are 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg for the forward and reverse shocks , respectively .",
    "the alfvn drift in such fields may lead to steepening of the energy spectra of accelerated particles .",
    "this effect has been earlier recognized and explored by ellison et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for cas  a , and recently also by morlino and caprioli ( @xcite ) for tycho .",
    "the comparison of the magnetic fields in the stellar wind and ejecta implies very large amplification factors : @xmath315 and 700 for the forward and reverse shocks , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field of the ejecta is the field of the exploded supernova progenitor . presumably , the field was additionally amplified during the propagation of the radiative shock inside the exploded star when vortex motions downstream of the shock result in the efficient gas mixing ( see the modeling of iwamoto et al .",
    "these motions can also amplify random magnetic fields in the star interior .",
    "the random magnetic field may be amplified downstream of the shock moving in the medium with density perturbations ( giacalone & jokipii @xcite ) .",
    "eventually the shock crosses the outer layers of the exploded star and enters into a circumstellar medium .",
    "the downstream material forms a supernova ejecta .",
    "in order to estimate the ejecta random magnetic field in this scenario , let us assume that a small fraction @xmath316 of a supernova mechanical energy @xmath161 is transformed into a magnetic energy .",
    "at later epochs the magnetic field strength drops proportional to @xmath317 , where @xmath303 is the radius of a progenitor and @xmath318 is the characteristic velocity of ejecta .",
    "hence the magnetic field of ejecta at time @xmath287 is determined as    @xmath319 @xmath320 even for the modest value of @xmath321 the magnetic field in the ejecta of a core collapse supernovae at @xmath322 yr achieves @xmath323 level .",
    "lower values @xmath324 g are expected for ia supernovae originating from a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf with a characteristic radius @xmath325 cm .    in the case of cas",
    "a , we obtain the magnetic field of ejecta @xmath234 0.5 @xmath208 g which is close to the value found in the previous section .",
    "although this field is random , it has a rather large scales , namely an order of 1/100 of the radius of the reverse shock .",
    "it can be considered as a large scale field because the non - resonant streaming instability amplifies magnetic fields with even smaller scales .",
    "we should note that the above amplification factors are significantly larger compared to the results obtained from the numerical modeling of nonresonant streaming instability ( zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite ) . to a large extent",
    "this is not a surprise ; it is difficult to amplify the magnetic field by three orders of magnitude in mhd modeling with its limited spatial resolution .",
    "it is likely that the amplified magnetic fields are strongly underestimated in the available numerical simulations because of the numerical viscosity .",
    "another possibility can be related to a possible additional amplification that takes place in the upstream regions of cr modified shocks moving in the medium with strong density perturbations .",
    "the deceleration of gas clumps by the cr pressure is slower compared to a less dense plasma .",
    "they will stretch and additionally amplify the random magnetic field pre - amplified far upstream of the shock by the non - resonant streaming instability .",
    "the possibility of this kind of magnetic amplification was demonstrated recently by drury and downes ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar idea was also proposed earlier by beresnyak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . given that the stellar winds and ejecta are very clumpy , so this scenario of additional amplification seems quite plausible .",
    "it should be noted that the high magnetic fields found in our modeling are not rare in young supernova remnants .",
    "for example chandra et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , based on the observed effect of synchrotron aging of radio electrons in the extragalactic iib snr 1993j , derived the downstream magnetic field strength between 0.19  g and 0.33  g after 3200 days of the explosion .",
    "this value is also in agreement with the synchrotron self - absorption model of fransson and bjrnsson ( @xcite ) . for comparison , in our hadronic model h2 for cas",
    "a the downstream magnetic field strength is only 0.04 g at the same 3200th day after the explosion .",
    "the upper limit of the maximum energy of accelerated protons at the forward shock is estimated as ( see zirakashvili & ptuskin @xcite )    @xmath326 @xmath327    here @xmath328 is the ratio of the energy flux of run - away particles @xmath329 to the flux of kinetic energy @xmath330 , @xmath331 is the strength of the random magnetic field in the circumstellar medium .",
    "this limit corresponds to the situation when the random magnetic field is amplified via the nonresonant streaming instability exponentially in time ( see also bell et al .",
    "@xcite , schure & bell @xcite ) .",
    "the instability is driven by the electric current of the highest energy particles .    for estimates ,",

    "( 10 ) , and fix the expansion parameter @xmath333 .",
    "the parameter @xmath334 is determined by the energy density of particles @xmath335 at the end of their spectrum , just before the cut - off . for shocks with compression ratio @xmath336 the parameter @xmath334",
    "is estimated as @xmath337 .",

    "since the parameters of our modeling are adjusted to reproduce the multiwavelength observations of cas  a , we conclude that both magnetic amplification and maximum energy of accelerated particles are underestimated by the theory , despite the rather modest maximum energy of about 40  tev required to explain the spectral points at very high energy gamma - rays .",
    "the reason is the steep energy distribution of accelerated particles derived from the gamma - ray data .",
    "this results in a small value of @xmath344 at the forward shock .",
    "the steep particle spectrum itself is explained by the strong magnetic field and correspondingly by the high alfvn speed upstream the shock .",
    "this result found for cas a has a more general implication ; it shows that the strong magnetic field does not necessarily provide higher maximum energy of accelerated particles .",
    "we should note that in the more realistic case of oblique shocks the maximum energy is higher than the one given by eq .",
    "this equation was derived for quasiparallel shocks . taking this into account",
    "we can conclude that maximum energy of particles accelerated in cas a corresponds to the number density of the highest energy particles ( see eq.10 ) .",

    "the problem of electron injection remains one of the poorly understood aspects of the theory of diffusive shock acceleration of particles in snrs .",
    "this general problem becomes especially important in the models of cas a without a rsg shell ( models h2 and l1 ) which require very high electron - to - nucleon ratio @xmath346 at the reverse shock .",

    "for this reason we invoke the electron ( positron ) injection from @xmath2ti decays ( zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite ) . to our knowledge",
    ", no other ideas have been proposed so far which would provide such a high electron - to - nucleon ratio .",
    "note that the electron injection from @xmath2ti decay is not required in the model h1 in which @xmath348 .",
    "thus , any other electron injection mechanism which can provide this ratio at the reverse shock can be used in the model h1 .",
    "however , the positrons from @xmath2ti decays accelerated later by the reverse shock are of certain interest from the point of view of origin of galactic cr positrons .",
    "the reason of high values of @xmath349 in the models h2 and l1 is the low energetics of the reverse shock . correspondingly , the amplified magnetic fields are weak . thus , to reproduce the radio flux from the reverse shock , one has to assume large number of injected nonthermal electrons .    the forward shock of cas a propagates in the stellar wind with a @xmath92 density profile . in this environment",
    "the energy of the shocked ejecta consists only 1@xmath202 of the total energy in shocked plasma .",
    "the energetics of reverse shocks is higher and is of the order of @xmath350 for snrs expanding in the uniform medium .",
    "it can reach up to @xmath351 for snrs expanding in the bubbles where plasma density increases towards the walls of the bubble .",
    "this is exactly what happened 40 years after explosion in the model h1 .",
    "the collision of the shock with the rsg shell transfers a significant fraction of the explosion energy into the region of the reverse shock .    as for the electron injection at the forward shock of cas",
    "a , we used a standard approach and prescribed some injection efficiency in models h1 and h2 . because of the low wind density , the amount of suprathermal electrons produced via compton scattering of gamma - rays from the decay of @xmath34co appears to be not sufficient for explanation of the radio and x - ray production by the forward shock of cas a. at first glance one may increase the injection momentum of electrons to reproduce observations .",
    "however , any assumption on injection momenta higher than 200 - 300 mev / c leads to contradiction with the radio spectrum .",
    "while the acceleration of particles by the reverse shock in cas  a seems to be a natural and well justified component in the general picture , it is fair to ask a question whether can we explain the multiwavelength data of cas  a without invoking the contribution of the reverse shock .",
    "formally , the available data do not allow us to give a certain answer to this question .",
    "note that a nonlinear dsa model without the consideration of the reverse shock has been discussed by berezhko et al .",
    "their model contains many components of our models h1 and h2 , including the presence of the rsg shell .    in the model",
    "h2 almost all non - thermal x - rays are produced at the forward shock while the thermal bremsstrahlung from the reverse shock contributes to x - rays at energies below 10 kev .",
    "the production of non - thermal x - ray emission at the reverse shock is a favored option ( uchiyama & aharonian @xcite , helder & vink @xcite ) , however it is not yet firmly established . in particular , it has been argued that the non - thermal x - ray filaments in the reverse shock region are in fact the projected filaments and belong to the forward shock ( delaney et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observed bright radio - ring can also be explained without the electron acceleration at the reverse shock .",
    "the development of the reighley - taylor instability at the contact discontinuity can result in an additional amplification of magnetic field in the snr interior ( see e.g. the mhd modeling of jun and norman @xcite ) , thus the electrons accelerated at the forward shock may produce enhanced synchrotron radio - emission inside the shell of snr .",
    "so , perhaps one may argue that the major morphological and spectral features of cas  a reported so far , can be addressed , in principle , by the forward shock .",
    "on the other hand one may ask another question about the fundamental difference between the reverse and forward shocks in cas a. both shocks propagate in the media having a common origin .",
    "they are the same stellar material ejected prior to the explosion ( the stellar wind ) and during the explosion ( the supernova ejecta ) .",
    "as argued in section 8.2 , presently the magnetic fields in the wind and ejecta are comparable .",
    "the speeds of both shocks also are similar .",
    "therefore , there is no reason for dsa to operate effectively in the forward shock and be suppressed in the reverse shock",
    ". the situation could be quite different for snrs produced in ia supernova explosions .",
    "the magnetic field of ejecta in these snrs is significantly lower compared to the interstellar magnetic field ( see section 8.2 ) .",
    "thus only the forward shock can contribute to the very high energy radiation .",
    "however , even at such small fields , the reverse shock can accelerate electrons to gev energies , and thus be a source of radio emission and gamma - ray bremsstrahlung .",
    "such a scenario presumably is realized in the tycho where non - thermal x - ray emission is not observed in the reverse shock region while we see radio - emission related with the supernova ejecta ( dickel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the distinct features of the reverse shock is the high electron - to - nucleon ratio at the reverse shock , @xmath352 .",
    "since the reverse shock is modified by the pressure of accelerated ions , a significant part of energy goes into accelerated electrons at the reverse shock . in this",
    "regard a plasma of the reverse shock have properties similar to properties of bright radio - knots .",
    "atoyan et al .",
    "@xcite found that the energy of relativistic electrons in the knots is close to @xmath353 fraction of the explosion energy . since",
    "a volume factor of the knots is of the order of @xmath354 it is easy to estimate that the energy density of accelerated electrons in the radio - knots may be comparable with the mean energy density inside the supernova shell . this may be considered as an independent evidence for a common origin of radio - knots and supernova ejecta . in our model",
    "the high energy density is explained by the `` radioactive '' origin of electrons and positrons injected at the reverse shock ( zirakashvili & aharonian @xcite ) .    in the inner region of cas",
    "a , the sheet - like structures and filaments are observed in the infrared band ( isensee et al .",
    "this material has not yet encountered the reverse shock .",
    "these clumpy structures can produce the x - ray , optical and radio - knots knots after the reverse shock passage .",
    "it is expected that the ejecta clumps have a broad range of densities .",
    "the clumps with the lowest density contrast move with a velocity close to the the gas velocity just downstream of the reverse shock .",
    "this velocity @xmath355 km s@xmath10 in the model h1 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the corresponding expansion age @xmath356 years is close to the measured value of the radio - knots of the bright radio - ring ( tuffs @xcite , anderson & rudnick @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale expansion of the radio - ring is even slower and is treated as the expansion of the reverse shock with the speed @xmath357 km s@xmath10 ( delaney & rudnick @xcite ) which is comparable with the reverse shock velocity @xmath358 km s@xmath10 in the model h1 .",
    "denser ejecta clumps are less decelerated after the reverse shock crossing and are initially observed as x - ray knots , while the densest clumps are initially observed as optical knots . at later epochs they have entered the region downstream the forward shock .",
    "the radio - electrons accelerated during the transition through the reverse shock are still inside the clumps .",
    "alternatively they can be accelerated by internal shocks in the clump .",
    "the clumps are eventually destroyed by the shear kelvin - helmholz instability .",
    "a material and accelerated electrons of clumps are mixed with the plasma of radio - plateau ( see discussion and modeling of anderson et al .",
    "the electrons emit a radio synchrotron radiation in the strong magnetic field downstream of the forward shock .",
    "this field probably is additionally amplified by the shear instability .",
    "since the reverse shock is strongly modified by cr pressure , the electron spectra at the reverse shock and in the clumps have concave shape and are steeper at low energies .",
    "this results in steep radio - spectra of the reverse shock and knots .",
    "the electrons that escape the knots may produce even steeper radio - spectra because of higher magnetic fields and because of an energy dependent propagation as discussed by atoyan et al . @xcite .",
    "in addition , the radio - knots near the forward shock are observed with steeper spectra ( anderson & rudnick @xcite ) . a possible interpretation could be that closer to the forward shock the magnetic field is stronger . here , the electrons emitting at the given radio frequency have lower energies",
    ". then their concave spectrum results in the steeper spectra of the knots near the forward shock .",
    "this qualitative picture seems in agreement both with theoretical ( berezhko et al .",
    "@xcite ; atoyan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and observational conclusions ( anderson & rudnick @xcite ; delaney & rudnick @xcite ) .",
    "below we summarize the main results of study of the present work on the nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration in cas  a , and the related broad - band electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the available observational properties of cas a are better reproduced by the hadronic model h1 when both the forward and reverse shocks significantly contribute to the broad - band emission .",
    "the gamma - ray production is strongly dominated by decays of @xmath3-mesons from interactions of protons ( in the forward shock ) and ions ( in the reverse shock ) .",
    "the contributions of the forward and reverse shocks around 1 tev are comparable .",
    "the reverse shock produces also approximately 50% of the radio , and 90% of the x - ray synchrotron emission of cas a.    \\2 .",
    "the model requires ejected mass of about @xmath359 and the explosion energy @xmath360erg .",
    "the forward shock propagates into the stellar wind with the mass - loss rate @xmath361 km s@xmath10 ) yr@xmath10 .",
    "magnetic fields required by the model significantly exceeds the strength of the magnetic field allowed by the mhd treatment of the nonresonant streaming instability .",
    "either the current mhd simulations strongly underestimates the strength of the amplified magnetic field , or an additional amplification is needed .",
    "a possible mechanism could be related to the clumpiness of ejecta and the circumstellar medium .",
    ". another important ingredient of the model h1 is the presence of the dense shell of the compressed red supergiant stellar wind at the distance @xmath249  pc from the supernova progenitor .",
    "contrary to the pure stellar wind models h2 and l1 , this permits to explain several observational features of cas a like the fast decrease of the flux of non - thermal x - rays , the dominance of the reverse shock in the production of non - thermal x - rays and the slow expansion rate of the bright radio - ring and radio - knots .",
    "the acceleration efficiency in cas a should be very high . at present 25@xmath190 of the energy of supernova explosion",
    "is transferred into accelerated particles .",
    "the previous claims of the low acceleration efficiency have been based on the high gas density derived from x - ray observations .",
    "the plasma density has been strongly overestimated because the non - thermal x - ray component was not properly taken into account .",
    "\\5 . the reverse shock of cas a is modified by the pressure of energetic ions , positrons and electrons .",
    "the energy content in accelerated electrons and positrons from radioactive decay of @xmath2ti is very close to @xmath1 erg or 0.1% of the explosion energy .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated particles in cas a can not exceed 100  tev .",
    "this can be related to the weak magnetic field of about @xmath362 in the red supergiant stellar wind where the forward shock propagates .",
    "because of this , the scale of the random magnetic field generated by the nonresonant streaming instability is rather small @xmath363 cm .",
    "the corresponding to the small - scale scattering @xmath69 type dependence of the diffusion coefficient is favored by hard x - ray and tev gamma - ray data .",
    "more accurate spectroscopic measurements of the gamma - ray spectrum of cas a are highly desirable .",
    "the measurements at sub gev and multi - tev energies will help to better distinguish between the hadronic and leptonic scenarios . in the case of hadronic origin of gamma - ray emission ,",
    "the spectral shape at multi tev energies will give an important information about the maximum energies of accelerated particles .",
    "it will be also interesting to search gamma - rays from the vicinity of cas a. the dense gas shells formed by the winds of the cas a progenitor seems to be ideal targets for production of gamma - rays by highest energy particles which already have left the remnant .",
    "these shells , presumably situated at 5 - 30@xmath364 from the center of cas a , can be considered as potential sources of multi - tev gamma - rays - presently or in the near future .",
    "it depends on whether or not the high energy particles have already reached the shells ."
