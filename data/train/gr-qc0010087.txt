    "the important studies of peebles @xcite and bond and efstathiou @xcite have led to the formula for the multipole moments of the cmb radiation , @xmath9 , caused by small density perturbations with flat spectrum ( also known as harrison ",
    "zeldovich  peebles , or scale - invariant spectrum ; spectral index @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 this formula aims to describe the lower order multipoles of the cmbr variations in a spatially flat universe .",
    "the general acceptance of this result is reflected in the fact that the @xmath9 distributions are usually plotted in terms of the function @xmath12 versus @xmath6 . in these units ,",
    "formula ( [ eq : one ] ) is conveniently plotted as a horizontal line .",
    "clearly , formula ( [ eq : one ] ) was derived under some assumptions , and this derivation requires amendments .",
    "indeed , let us start from the monopole moment @xmath1 , setting @xmath13 in this formula .",
    "expression ( [ eq : one ] ) predicts infinity for @xmath1 , in conflict with observations . surely , it would be difficult to observationally distinguish a monopole component caused by perturbations from the isotropic unperturbed temperature @xmath14 , but it is strange that a theoretical formula gives infinity for an effect produced by small perturbations",
    "let us now consider the dipole , @xmath15 , and the quadrupole , @xmath16 , moments . according to ( [ eq : one ] ) ,",
    "the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath4 are numerically of the same order of magnitude , @xmath17 .",
    "however , we know from observations that the observed dipole variation of the temperature is about 100 times larger than the observed quadrupole variation .    the predictions of formula ( [ eq : one ] ) also seem to disagree with independent theoretical studies . according to grishchuk & zeldovich , in the limit of long - wavelength perturbations , which normally provide dominant contributions to the @xmath13 and @xmath18 multipoles , the monopole and quadrupole variations of the cmbr temperature",
    "should be small and approximately equal . at the same time",
    ", the dipole variation should be suppressed , as compared with the monopole and quadrupole , in proportion to the ratio @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hubble radius and @xmath21 is the perturbation s wavelength , @xmath22 .",
    "the multipole moments @xmath9 , being quadratic in the temperature variations , contain this factor in the second power .",
    "the factor @xmath23 becomes much larger than 1 in the opposite limit of short - wavelength perturbations , @xmath24 .",
    "the dipole component is , thus , expected to be very sensitive to short waves , and its value should eventually exceed the values of the monopole and quadrupole components , as soon as the contribution of short - wavelength perturbations is also included .",
    "however , formula ( [ eq : one ] ) suggests results differing from these conclusions .",
    "the discrepancy is especially troublesome , as the derivation of ( [ eq : one ] ) seems to have taken into account the perturbations of all wavelengths .",
    "indeed , this formula arises from the table integral ( discussed below in section [ sec - third ] ) @xmath25 ^ 2 \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}n}{n } =   \\frac{1}{2\\ell ( \\ell + 1)},\\ ] ] where the integration over wave - numbers @xmath26 ranges formally from zero to infinity .",
    "therefore , according to this integral , the very short - wavelength perturbations have also been taken into account in the calculation of all @xmath9 s , including the dipole @xmath2 .",
    "the demonstrated deficiencies of formula ( [ eq : one ] ) for @xmath13 and @xmath15 indicate that there could also be significant deviations from the values suggested by ( [ eq : one ] ) in the case of @xmath16 and higher order multipoles . this consideration has prompted us to reanalyse the derivation of formula ( [ eq : one ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec - first ] we introduce the necessary notations and remind the reader the basics of the sachs  wolfe result @xcite . for the purpose of later comparison with observations , we consider primordial spectra with arbitrary spectral indices",
    ", so that the flat spectrum @xmath27 is simply a particular case .",
    "section [ sec - second ] summarises the statistical assumptions and defines the multipole moments . in section [ sec - third ]",
    "we identify the terms that were dropped out in the course of the original derivation of formula ( [ eq : one ] ) .",
    "we show the importance of these terms and restore them . after this correction ,",
    "the numerical values of the monopole and quadrupole moments become comparable to each other , while the dipole moment becomes sensitive to short - wavelength perturbations , as it should . at the same time",
    ", the correct formula for @xmath9 requires the function @xmath28 to deviate from the horizontal line and grow with @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "formally , this growth would be unlimited if one were allowed to use the primordial power - law spectrum for arbitrarily large values of the wavenumber @xmath26 .",
    "however , it is known that the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations should experience a turnover , caused by the transition of the cosmological expansion from the radiation - dominated to the matter - dominated regime @xcite . by the time of decoupling , the primordial spectrum gets modified .",
    "mathematically , the original power spectrum gets multiplied by the modulating function ( transfer function ) .",
    "the modulating function is practically unity in the spectral region of long - wavelength perturbations , but it strongly suppresses the power in short - wavelength perturbations . as a result , the growth of the function @xmath28 terminates and is being followed by its decline at multipoles , roughly , around @xmath29 .",
    "this causes the function @xmath30 to form the first peak , recently observed @xcite . the following ( less prominent ) peaks of the modulating function are responsible for the further peaks of the function @xmath5 . in section [ sec - fourth ] we analyse in detail the form of the modulating function and derive the possible ( theoretical ) positions and heights of the first peak .",
    "we think that the origin of the subsequent peaks in the @xmath6-space is due to the modulation of the metric power spectrum of density perturbations ( oscillations in the @xmath26-space ) .",
    "this modulation , in its turn , entirely arises due to the standing - wave character of the initial density perturbations .",
    "travelling sound waves in the radiation - dominated era would not have produced sakharov oscillations at the time of decoupling , as was explained long ago ( see section 11.6 in zeldovich & novikov ) .",
    "the recent paper @xcite may be providing support to this interpretation of the peaks .",
    "however , the origin and position of secondary peaks is not the subject of this paper , so we leave the door open for alternative interpretations .",
    "the full computation of all multipoles is presented in section [ sec - fifth ] .",
    "we replace the existing uncertainties about the matter content of the universe by the two phenomenological parameters : the decoupling red - shift @xmath31 and the matter - radiation equality red - shift @xmath32 .",
    "we also vary the third parameter , @xmath33 , which characterises the spectral slope of the primordial perturbations .",
    "( the flat spectrum @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath34 . )",
    "we show how the distributions of multipole moments depend on the choice of these parameters .",
    "since we concentrate on anisotropies of gravitational origin , the chemical composition of matter in the universe is unimportant , as long as the perturbations can be described by solutions to the perturbed einstein equations at the radiation - dominated stage ( equation of state @xmath35 ) followed by the matter - dominated stage ( equation of state @xmath36 ) .",
    "section [ sec - sixth ] gives a preliminary comparison of the calculated multipole moments ( including the dipole ) with the available cmbr observations .",
    "we require the theoretical ( statistical ) dipole , as well as the location and the height of the first peak , to be as close as possible to their observed values .",
    "it appears , then , that the values of the cobe - observed @xcite multipoles , around @xmath37 , are somewhat larger than the theoretical curves for @xmath5 would require .",
    "the , so far neglected , intrinsic anisotropies ( temperature variations at the last scattering surface ) can only increase the height of the first peak making this discrepancy larger .",
    "the most natural way of removing this discrepancy is to take into account gravitational waves .",
    "they mostly contribute to the multipoles from @xmath16 to approximately @xmath38 , without changing the dipole , and not seriously affecting the location and height of the peak .",
    "section [ sec - seventh ] describes the contribution of gravitational waves . in effect , we calculate the amount of gravitational waves needed in order to raise the ` plateau ' at lower @xmath6 s to the actually observed level . in section [ sec - eighth ]",
    "we again compare the theory with observations , this time including gravitational waves , and discuss the values of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 that produce distributions @xmath39 in better agreement with cmbr observations .",
    "we argue that a slightly larger amount of gravitational waves allows the primordial spectrum to be somewhat ` blue ' ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) instead of being flat .",
    "the @xmath9 s produced by such ` blue ' spectra are still consistent with the discussed observations .",
    "we consider this fact as a satisfactory conclusion , since , from the theoretical standpoint , the flat spectrum and ` red ' spectra ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) are undesirable . indeed , the mean square values of the metric ( gravitational field ) fluctuations are logarithmically divergent for the @xmath27 case and power - law divergent for all @xmath42 , in the limit of long waves .",
    "the removal of these divergences would require extra assumptions .",
    "appendix a contains some technical details of the derivation of the corrected formula for @xmath9 .",

    "the scale factor behaves as @xmath46 , which we write as @xmath47 where @xmath20 is the hubble radius at the present time @xmath48 .",
    "the constant @xmath49 is needed for further considerations .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath50 . with this convention , the wave - length equal to the hubble radius today corresponds to the wave - number @xmath51 . in the matter - dominated era ,",
    "the employed coordinate system is both synchronous and comoving - the most convenient choice @xcite .",
    "the elements of plasma emitting the cmb photons , as well as the observer , are ` frozen ' in the perturbed deforming matter and , by the definition of the comoving coordinate system , have zero velocities with respect to the matter fluid .",
    "let the direction of observation of a photon emitted at @xmath52 be characterised by a unit vector @xmath53 the relative temperature variation @xmath54 seen in a given direction @xmath55 is described by the integral @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and the integration is performed along the path @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is related to the red - shift @xmath31 at decoupling as @xmath61 typically , the quantity @xmath60 is very close to 1 .",
    "the fact that the photons coming from different directions might have been emitted at slightly different @xmath62 s is irrelevant for this calculation , as the integrand in expression ( [ eq : swformula ] ) is already a small quantity of first order .",
    "a first order variation of the upper limit of integration will change the result only in second order of smallness .",
    "however , a small initial variation of the temperature over the last scattering surface will be reflected in an additive term to the integral ( [ eq : swformula ] ) .",
    "this term would be effective even in the absence of the intervening gravitational field @xmath45 along the photon s path , and it can be called the intrinsic anisotropy @xmath63 .",
    "we discuss this term later , in section [ sec - fifth ] . as long as further scattering and absorption of cmb photons can be neglected ,",

    ", one can normally neglect one of the two linearly - independent solutions to the perturbed equations , and work with the so - called growing solution . in the case of density perturbations at the matter - dominated stage , the growing solution is @xmath64 using formula ( [ eq : firstpertdp ] ) in the integral ( [ eq : swformula ] ) , one obtains @xcite @xmath65 the exceptional property of the solution ( [ eq : firstpertdp ] ) is that the integrand becomes a total derivative , so the integral ( [ eq : swformula ] ) reduces to the values of the under - integral quantity at the end - points of integration .",
    "this property is responsible for formula ( [ eq : tempanisfirst ] ) . in the general case , this is not true , and is only approximately true for other types of perturbations when they are taken in the long - wavelength limit @xcite . in view of the already existing disorder in the literature with respect to the naming and interpretation of different parts of the sachs ",

    "<S> the important studies of peebles , and bond and efstathiou have led to the formula @xmath0 $ ] aimed at describing the lower order multipoles of the cmbr temperature variations caused by density perturbations with the flat spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this formula requires amendments , as it predicts an infinitely large monopole @xmath1 , and a dipole moment @xmath2 only @xmath3 times larger than the quadrupole @xmath4 , both predictions in conflict with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we restore the terms omitted in the course of the derivation of this formula , and arrive at a new expression . according to the corrected formula </S>",
    "<S> , the monopole moment is finite and small , while the dipole moment is sensitive to short - wavelength perturbations , and numerically much larger than the quadrupole , as one would expect on physical grounds . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the function @xmath5 deviates from a horizontal line and grows with @xmath6 , for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of the modulating ( transfer ) function terminates the growth and forms the first peak , recently observed . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the theoretical curves to the position and height of the first peak , as well as to the observed dipole , varying three parameters : red - shift at decoupling , red - shift at matter - radiation equality , and slope of the primordial spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that there is always a deficit , as compared with the cobe observations , at small multipoles , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a reasonable and theoretically expected amount of gravitational waves bridges this gap at small multipoles , leaving the other fits as good as before . we show that the observationally acceptable models permit somewhat ` blue ' primordial spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to avoid the infra - red divergence of cosmological perturbations , which is otherwise present .    cosmic microwave background </S>"
