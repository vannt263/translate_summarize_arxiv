    "the most precise determinations of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element  @xmath9  @xcite are obtained using combined fits to inclusive @xmath1  decay distributions  @xcite .",
    "these analyses are based on calculations of the semileptonic decay rate and spectral moments in @xmath10 and @xmath11  decays in the frameworks of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , which predict these quantities in terms of @xmath9 and a number of non - perturbative heavy quark ( hq ) parameters including the @xmath4-quark mass  @xmath12 .",
    "analyses combining measurements from different experiments  @xcite quote the most precise numbers for @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , as the correlated systematic uncertainties are not precisely known , there is some concern that uncertainties are underestimated . in this analysis ,",
    "we have chosen the opposite approach and perform fits to the data from the belle experiment only .",
    "in addition , we use two independent sets of theoretical expressions , derived in the 1s  @xcite and kinetic mass  @xcite schemes respectively , to test the compatibility of these two frameworks .    the present document is organized as follows : sect .",
    "[ sect:1 ] describes the measurement of the first and second moment of the inclusive photon energy spectrum in @xmath0 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , using the belle measurement of this decay in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the previously published analysis",
    "the first and second moments were obtained for one value of the minimum energy threshold , namely @xmath15  gev . here",
    "we report additional measurements with @xmath16  gev , and perform a re - evaluation of the systematic error . in sect .",
    "[ sect:2 ] we use these data together with the recent belle measurements of the lepton energy and hadronic mass moments in @xmath17  decays  @xcite to extract @xmath9 and @xmath12 using theoretical expressions derived in the 1s and kinetic mass schemes .",
    "the analysis described in ref .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath18  events equivalent to 140  fb@xmath19 of integrated luminosity ( on sample ) and 15  fb@xmath19 taken 60  mev below the @xmath20  resonance energy ( off sample ) .",
    "photon candidates with energy greater than 1.5  gev as measured in the @xmath20  rest frame are reconstructed .",
    "vetoes are applied to photon candidates with high likelihood of originating from @xmath21 or @xmath22  decays to two photons .    in general ,",
    "the background of photons from the @xmath23  continuum is dominant .",
    "it is suppressed with event shape variables used as the inputs to two fisher discriminants  @xcite .",
    "the first discriminant distinguishes spherically - shaped @xmath24 from jet - like continuum events and includes the fox - wolfram moments  @xcite , the thrust calculated using all particles detected in the event including and excluding the candidate photon , and the angles of the corresponding thrust axes with respect to the beam and candidate photon directions , respectively .",
    "the second discriminant is designed to exploit the topology of @xmath0  events by utilizing the energy sum of detected particles , which is measured in three angular regions bounded by cones that are subtended from the direction of the candidate photon in the @xmath20  frame ; defined as @xmath25 ( forward ) , @xmath26 ( middle ) , and @xmath27 ( backward ) .",
    "after these selections are applied , the remaining continuum background is removed by subtracting scaled off data from the on data set .",
    "backgrounds in @xmath24  events , including photons from @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( veto leakage ) , other real photons ( mainly from @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) , clusters in the calorimeter not due to single photons ( mainly electrons interacting with matter , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and beam background , are estimated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ( fig .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we calculate the truncated first and second moments , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , of the efficiency corrected spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_1 ] for minimum photon energies ranging from 1.8 to 2.3  gev .",
    "the following corrections are applied to these moments : the non - zero @xmath1  meson momentum in the @xmath20  rest frame changes the first moment of the photon energy by 0.2% and adds a doppler broadening of 0.006  gev@xmath33 to the second moment ; the finite energy resolution , uncorrected in fig .  [ fig:1_1 ] , causes a broadening of the spectrum and increases the second moment by 0.004  gev@xmath33 ; the 100  mev binning in fig .  [ fig:1_1 ] increases the second moment by 0.0008  gev@xmath33 .    the above corrections assume a symmetric photon energy distribution , and do not account for expected and known asymmetries in the true spectrum and detector response , respectively . to account for these effects an additional bias correction , derived from a mc simulation ,",
    "is implemented .",
    "the @xmath0  model contains decays of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is any known spin-@xmath36 resonance with strangeness @xmath37 .",
    "the relative amounts of these decays are adjusted by matching the total photon spectrum to the theoretical model of ref .",
    "the bias correction , calculated as the difference of the true moment and the moment measured in the @xmath0  mc simulation once all aforementioned corrections are applied , is listed in table  [ tab:1_1 ] .",

    "we have determined the first and second moments of the photon energy distribution in @xmath0  decays , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for minimum photon energies in the @xmath1  meson rest frame ranging from 1.8 to 2.3  gev using the measurement of this spectrum published in ref .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab:1_4 ] .",

    "we have combined these measurements with recent belle data on the lepton energy and hadronic mass moments in @xmath17  decays  @xcite to extract @xmath9 , @xmath12 and other non - perturbative parameters using theoretical expressions derived in the 1s  @xcite and kinetic  @xcite schemes .",
    "the fits give consistent values of @xmath9 in the two schemes .",
    "in the 1s scheme analysis we find @xmath42 and @xmath6  gev . in the kinetic scheme , we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44  gev .",
    "note that the @xmath12  values can only be compared after scheme translation .",
    "the fit results using only the @xmath17  data are @xmath45 and @xmath46  gev in the 1s  scheme , and @xmath47 and @xmath48  gev in the kinetic scheme ( see tables  [ tab:2_3 ] and [ tab:2_5 ] ) .    the ckm magnitude @xmath9 and the @xmath4-quark masses @xmath49 have been extracted with values that are consistent with previous determinations  @xcite . in the 1s  scheme @xmath9 has been measured with 1.6% precision .",
