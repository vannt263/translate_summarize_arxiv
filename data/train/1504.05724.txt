    "atomic ensembles stored in microscopic dipole traps provide an excellent system in which to study atomic collisions and light scattering processes .",
    "these microscopic dipole traps , so - called microtraps , enable the generation of atomic samples of very high density at modest atom number and temperature .",
    "such a system holds the potential for generating microscopic bose einstein condensates  @xcite . additionally , the use of rydberg states within these small and dense atomic ensembles has applications in quantum information , such as the realization of collective qubits @xcite and non - linear absorption and dispersion of light through collisions between rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "one of the key challenges in this system is the determination of the number of atoms in the microtrap .",
    "in particular , determining the atom number below the level of poissonian noise is important for realizing collective quantum gates based on rydberg `` superatoms '' @xcite .",
    "a standard approach is to fluorescence image the atomic sample by exposing it to red - detuned optical molasses and detecting a portion of the scattered light through high numerical aperture ( na ) optics @xcite .",
    "the laser cooling provided by the optical molasses enables an atom to scatter many photons while remaining trapped .",
    "however , the optical molasses drives light - assisted collisions that cause rapid pair - wise loss from the trap ; this occurs because the red - detuned light excites a colliding pair of atoms onto an attractive molecular potential energy curve that is typically many times deeper than the optical trap @xcite .",
    "this technique has been used to produce single atom occupancy in a microtrap @xcite , but is not well - suited to the non - destructive counting of more than one trapped atom .",
    "one can avoid this loss by releasing the atoms from the dipole trap and counting the atoms once the density is sufficiently low , either in free - space @xcite , or by recapturing them in a larger volume trap such as a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and probing them there @xcite .",
    "recently , atom counting in a mot has been demonstrated with single atom resolution for over 1000 atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , if the atomic sample is to be further manipulated within the microtrap , or if one wishes to count atoms in several adjacent microtraps , it would be particularly useful to employ an _ in situ _ method .    here",
    ", we describe an in - trap fluorescence detection method that allows us to count one to more than a hundred atoms held in a microscopic dipole trap , thereby permitting subsequent probing of the trapped atomic cloud .",
    "this is an extension of earlier work  @xcite , where fluorescence was induced using a standing wave of light that was blue - detuned from atomic resonance ; this configuration realizes a laser cooling mechanism that works well for small detunings ( @xmath0mhz ) and for intensities in excess of saturation , thereby yielding high photon scattering rates that make it ideal for fluorescence imaging .",
    "the sign of the detuning and the spatial variation of intensity lead to a form of sisyphus cooling @xcite that allows an atom to remain trapped during imaging and be detected with near unit efficiency .",
    "this capability permits us to eliminate the artifacts of loss during the imaging process . for samples containing more than one atom ,",
    "the small blue detuning limits the losses from inelastic light - assisted collisions , both by reducing their rate via optical shielding , and , in the case where such an inelastic collision occurs , by limiting the energy gained by the colliding atom pair to the detuning of the imaging light @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we show that this method can count atoms in samples of very high density ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) with sub - poissonian precision .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the experimental setup . in section  [",
    "sect : lightshifts ] , we summarize the methods used to calculate the light shifts of the dipole trap and probe light",
    ". section  [ sect : singleatomdetection ] describes fluorescence detection of a single atom held in a microtrap , and section  [ sect : multipleatomdetection ] extends this to the case of multiple atoms . in section  [",
    "sect : conclusion ] we present conclusions and provide an outlook for future work .",
    "rb atoms are loaded from a mot into a microscopic dipole trap .",
    "the microtrap is formed by passing 828  nm light through a high na lens mounted inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "atoms held in the microtrap are probed by a standing wave of light on the d1 line of @xmath4rb .",
    "the mot cooling beams are not shown .",
    "a portion of the light scattered by the trapped atoms is detected by an emccd camera.,width=325 ]    we prepare small atomic samples by loading a microscopic dipole trap from a cloud of @xmath4rb atoms held in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] is a schematic of the setup .",
    "the mot operates on the @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition of the d2 line of @xmath4rb ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) at wavelength @xmath9  nm .",
    "the light for the mot is supplied as three retro - reflected beams with gaussian intensity profiles , each with spot size ( @xmath10 waist ) 6.4  mm and apertured to 7  mm in diameter ; throughout the paper , we state the power measured after the apertures .",
    "a compressed mot ( cmot ) phase typically lasting 150  ms overlaps the center of the mot cloud with the dipole trap .",
    "subsequently , the magnetic field is extinguished and 5  ms of polarization gradient cooling leads to the loading of approximately one hundred atoms in the microtrap . the number of loaded atoms is typically varied by changing the duration of the mot loading time ( @xmath11  s ) and the cmot phase .",
    "three sets of helmholtz coils serve to null the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the microtrap is formed by focusing a linearly polarized gaussian beam with wavelength 828  nm by a high numerical aperture lens held in the vacuum chamber to a spot size of the lens is a single - piece molded asphere with numerical aperture 0.55 and working distance 2.92  mm ( lightpath model 352230 ) .",
    "the size and gaussian intensity distribution of the dipole trap beam were confirmed in a replica setup outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "these dipole beam parameters generate microscopic optical traps that are several mk deep using @xmath12  mw of optical power ; a detailed description of the light shifts induced by the dipole trap beam is presented in section [ sect : lightshifts ] .",
    "to detect atoms in the microtrap , we induce fluorescence with a probe beam on the d1 line of @xmath4rb . typically , the probe beam is blue - detuned from the @xmath13 to @xmath14 transition on the d1 line ( @xmath7 to @xmath15 ) for an atom at the center of the dipole trap .",
    "we choose the d1 line for imaging so that we can block stray light from the mot and dipole trap using standard optical filters .",
    "the detuning is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency of the laser field , and @xmath18 the frequency of the atomic resonance ; a blue detuning corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "the probe beam detuning an atom experiences depends on its position in the microtrap . in this paper",
    ", we reference the probe detuning to that experienced by an atom at the center of the dipole trap , and denote this by @xmath20 .",
    "the probe beam is linearly polarized ( along direction @xmath21 in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) and retro - reflected to form a standing wave by a metal mirror placed outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "a mechanical shutter lies in the return beam path so that the probe beam can be toggled between traveling and standing wave configurations within the course of an experimental run .",
    "the probe beam has a gaussian intensity profile and is focused with a waist of @xmath22 m at the position of the atoms .",
    "we use a focused beam primarily to avoid it hitting the high na lens so as to minimize stray light in images . due to the available ports of the vacuum chamber , the probe beam runs at an angle of @xmath23 to the radial axis of the dipole trap .",
    "given there is no cycling transition on the d1 line , we require repump light to return the atoms to the @xmath13 ground state . for this",
    ", we primarily use the mot cooling beams detuned by an amount @xmath24 from the d2 @xmath5 to @xmath14 transition for an atom at the center of the trap , averaged over the magnetic sublevels and assuming a uniform population distribution across these levels .",
    "we may also use the @xmath5 to @xmath25 transition on the d1 line to optically pump the atoms back to the lower ground state .",
    "this beam shares the same optical path as the probe beam ; i.e. , both d1 beams propagate through the same optical fiber . since our imaging system detects all d1 light , this repump beam increases the signal by about 80%  @xcite . for imaging ,",
    "the d1 and d2 beams are applied with rectangular pulse envelopes .",
    "a portion of the scattered light by the atomic sample is collected by the high na lens and directed onto an electron multiplying charge coupled device ( emccd ) camera .",
    "assuming fluorescence into a solid angle of @xmath26 , the high na lens collects 10% of the scattered light , and half of this is reflected by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the remaining light is optically filtered for dipole trap light at 828  nm and d2 light at 780  nm .",
    "room light is further suppressed using shields that enclose the vacuum chamber and surrounding optics .",
    "an image is formed on the emccd by a high quality lens with focal length 200  mm .",
    "the combined transmission of the pbs , filters and additional optics is 37@xmath27 .",
    "the emccd has a measured quantum efficiency of @xmath28 , so that the total detection efficiency is 2.3@xmath27 .",
    "we typically operate the camera with multiplication gain set such that the total ( mean ) gain @xmath29 , where the number of analog - to - digital units ( adu ) and the incident number of photons are linked by @xmath30 .",
    "the gain of the emccd is a result of several amplification stages in series leading to an additional multiplicative noise term of approximately @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the imaging system has magnification 44 , and the camera has pixel - size 16@xmath32m@xmath33 .",
    "the image of the atomic sample is integrated over an 11@xmath34  pixel region of interest , from which we subtract the mean background level from two ( @xmath35 80 x 80 pixel ) regions on either side of the atomic signal .",
    "the number of atoms held in the trap can be reduced by engaging the probe beam further blue - detuned from resonance @xcite .",
    "this technique excites an atom pair onto a repulsive molecular potential curve ; the energy gained by the atom pair in the process is at maximum @xmath1 , in contrast to the case of excitation by a red - detuned beam . in previous work",
    ", we have achieved a single atom loading efficiency in excess of 90%  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the imaging of single atoms produced by this technique , but we also employ it to obtain a single atom fluorescence signal as a reference level when imaging multiple trapped atoms .",
    "the use of a deep dipole trap to hold an atomic sample means that the atoms can scatter many photons and remain trapped , but it also requires us , when imaging , to take account of the significant light shifts induced by the microtrap @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the blue sisyphus mechanism used for probing relies on the spatial variation of the light shifts induced by the standing wave probe beam , so an accurate calculation of these shifts is critical to analyzing this mechanism applied to in - trap fluorescence detection .",
    "our approach is to calculate the light shifts generated by the dipole trap and to include these as effective spatially dependent detunings in the calculation of the light shifts due to the probe beam .",
    "this approach is valid and convenient because the large detuning from any optical transition of the dipole trap light means that the dressed states within the dipole trap are very well approximated by the bare atomic states with shifted energy levels @xcite .",
    "we calculate the light shifts induced by the dipole trap in a semi - classical picture where an applied laser beam is represented by a classical electric field @xmath36 .",
    "to second order in perturbation theory , the shift of atomic level @xmath37 is given by @xcite @xmath38 where the sum is taken over all other electronic states @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) denotes the dipole matrix element ( atomic transition frequency ) between states @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "if the frequency of the applied field is close to a given atomic transition , the rotating - wave approximation may be applied and the second term in parenthesis in eq .   may be discarded , leaving the denominator as the detuning from the chosen transition .    to calculate the light shifts for @xmath4rb",

    "we treat the probe beam as propagating orthogonal to the dipole trap beam . with the choice of a small blue detuning for an atom at the center of the trap , the effective detuning of the probe beam increases away from the center . thus ,",
    "at the center of the trap , the effective probe beam detuning is minimal and the light shift induced by the probe beam is maximal .",
    "away from the center , the effective blue detuning increases and the probe beam light shifts decrease in magnitude .",
    "our main goal in single atom fluorescence detection is to detect as much light scattered by the atom as possible while leaving it trapped . as such",
    ", the two quantities we use to characterize the detection performance are the integrated fluorescence  the number of adus we detect on the camera  and the retention probability  the probability that a single atom remains in the microtrap following a fluorescence image .",
    "the retention probability is a measure of the heating caused by the detection process .",
    "the higher the single atom scattering rate , the higher the integrated fluorescence signal and the greater the accuracy with which we can distinguish between the presence and absence of an atom in the microtrap .",
    "the integrated fluorescence and the retention probability are coupled in the sense that a low retention probability leads to the loss of an atom from the microtrap during the detection process , and thereby a lower signal than if the atom had remained trapped throughout the exposure .",
    "figure  [ fig : blue_spectrum_comp](a ) is a schematic of the experimental sequence we use to investigate fluorescence detection of a single atom held in the microtrap .",
    "the sequence begins by loading @xmath65 atoms into the microtrap from the mot , whereupon we drive inelastic light - assisted collisions to reduce the number of atoms in the trap to one or zero  @xcite .",
    "the first fluorescence image confirms the presence of an atom . for this image ,",
    "the probe beam is applied as a standing wave with @xmath64w power and detuning @xmath66  mhz , and the d2 beams each has power 1.4  mw and detuning @xmath67  mhz . by this imaging procedure",
    ", an atom is retained in the microtrap with 99% efficiency . in the second ` variable ' image ,",
    "an imaging parameter is varied , and the integrated fluorescence for this setting is recorded . the third image , identical in parameters to the first , tests whether the atom is still trapped after the second image .",
    "the outcome of the third image , conditioned on there being an atom present in the first image , gives the retention probability .",
    "all images have 10  ms exposure time .",
    "unless otherwise stated , each data point shows the mean of 200 ( unconditioned ) experimental runs and error bars show the standard error of the mean ; to avoid obtaining unphysical retention probabilities exceeding 100% , we do not correct for the small loss induced by the first and third images when calculating the probability of retaining an atom . with a view to presenting qualitative arguments to describe single atom detection , we simplify the physical picture by omitting the d1 repump light on the @xmath5 to @xmath25 transition .",
    "the addition of the d1 repump light does not change the performance of the fluorescence detection other than to increase the observed signal , a feature we make use of when imaging samples containing several atoms ( see section  [ sect : multipleatomdetection ] ) . to investigate the characteristics of the blue sisyphus mechanism as a function of detuning , and to confirm the light shift calculations of section  [ sect : lightshifts ]",
    ", we performed an in - trap fluorescence spectrum of a single atom . to do this , we varied the detuning of the probe beam in the ` variable image ' in the experimental sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : blue_spectrum_comp](a ) ) , while holding the power at @xmath64w .",
    "the mot cooling beams were set to @xmath68mhz and 1.4  mw per beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : blue_spectrum_comp](b ) shows the observed single - atom spectrum .",
    "the red squares show the mean integrated fluorescence for the experimental runs where there was an atom present in the first image .",
    "the black circles show the mean integrated fluorescence conditioned on there being an atom present both in the first and third images .",
    "the two data sets have been fitted with an asymmetric lorentzian model @xcite .",
    "the unconditioned data is asymmetric because the standing wave probe beam has a cooling effect on the blue side of the spectrum and a heating effect on the red side .",
    "this sign dependence of the detuning also shifts the peak of the unconditioned data approximately 3  mhz to the blue .",
    "in contrast , the peak of the conditioned data agrees well with @xmath69 , confirming the validity of the light shift calculation . this illustrates a great advantage of non - destructive imaging at the single atom level",
    ": it allows one to identify artifacts from features . in this case",
    ", we avoid the corruption of the spectroscopic signal due to atom loss .    the sisyphus mechanism realized by the standing wave probe beam cools an atom for blue detunings and heats for red detunings @xcite ,",
    "so it is somewhat surprising that for modest red detunings of the probe beam , , an atom remains trapped in some of the experimental runs .",
    "there are two reasons for this , both relating to the position of the atom in the microtrap and the effect this has on the frequency of the applied light fields for probing and optical pumping .",
    "first , the effective probe beam detuning is pushed to the blue as an atom travels into the wings of the microtrap . as such , although the standing wave probe beam heats an atom at the center of the trap for , in the wings the effective blue detuning is restored and the atom experiences the blue sisyphus cooling mechanism , thereby remaining trapped .",
    "second , the mot cooling beams laser cool a trapped atom when it moves to the wings of the microtrap : although tuned so as to optically pump an atom at the center of the trap back to the @xmath13 ground state , i.e. , @xmath70 , away from the center of the microtrap , an atom experiences the mot cooling beam frequency closer to the @xmath5 to @xmath6 cycling transition , thereby realizing a standard red - detuned optical molasses . as such , an atom can be heated at the center of the trap by the probe beam , but be cooled by the mot beams in the wings of the microtrap so that it remains trapped .",
    "to @xmath14 , @xmath47 , at constant mot cooling light power .",
    "the experiment was performed using standing wave ( black circles ) and traveling wave ( red squares ) probe beams .",
    "( a ) probability of retaining an atom in the microtrap .",
    "( b ) integrated fluorescence.,width=325 ]    this shows that it is important to characterize the role the mot cooling light plays in the detection process , even though its nominal role is to optically pump a trapped atom to the electronic ground state addressed by the probe beam . to do this , we varied the detuning of the mot cooling light while keeping the d1 imaging parameters constant .",
    "the experiment was performed for standing and traveling wave probe beams in the second image in order to test the cooling effect of the mot cooling light in the presence and absence of the sisyphus cooling mechanism . as noted above",
    ", the blue sisyphus cooling mechanism relies on the spatial modulation of the probe beam intensity : in a traveling wave configuration , the probe beam has a flat intensity distribution over the extent of the microtrap and therefore provides no cooling .",
    "figure  [ fig : retrovtravel_d2](a ) shows the probability of detecting an atom in the third image , conditioned on it being detected in the first . for both standing and traveling wave detection and @xmath71mhz ,",
    "the retention probability is in excess of 97% .",
    "however , below this detuning , both standing and traveling wave probe beams show an approximately linear decrease in retention probability , but the decrease is much sharper for the traveling wave case .",
    "thus , for @xmath71mhz , the d2 beams perform enough laser cooling to keep an atom trapped while imaging for this choice of probe beam parameters , whereas below this detuning , the blue sisyphus cooling mechanism of the probe beam is necessary to keeping the atom trapped .",
    "figure  [ fig : retrovtravel_d2](b ) shows the integrated fluorescence counts of the second image . in the standing wave case ,",
    "the counts are maximized for @xmath68mhz .",
    "5 ( black circles ) , 15 ( red squares ) and 35 ( blue diamonds )  mhz . ( a ) probability of retaining an atom in the microtrap .",
    "( b ) integrated fluorescence .",
    ", width=325 ]    to investigate this imaging process further , we scanned the probe beam power for several values of detuning . in order to focus on the cooling effect of the blue sisyphus mechanism ,",
    "the d2 light was set to @xmath72  mhz with 1.4  mw per beam .",
    "this value of the detuning was a compromise between accentuating the cooling effect of the standing wave probe beam , and ensuring efficient optical pumping and hence a good signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : imaging_d2_1 ] shows the retention probability and integrated fluorescence for three values of the probe beam detuning :    the retention probability shows an interesting structure for the low detuning , which is approximately equal to the natural linewidth of the transition . for zero power , the retention probability is of course approximately one , limited only by the performance of the first and third images .",
    "however , as the power of the probe beam is increased very slightly , the retention probability drops sharply and reaches a local minimum at a power of @xmath73w , corresponding approximately to saturation intensity @xmath74 for the transition . as the power",
    "is further increased , the retention probability increases to a peak value and eventually begins to decrease .",
    "the initial drop at low power can be understood as doppler heating predominating over the sisyphus mechanism . to give a qualitative picture of this behaviour",
    ", we argue using the simple treatment of doppler heating / cooling , where the total force on an atom due to a counter - propagating pair of laser beams is given by the sum of the contribution from each beam  @xcite . using this description ,",
    "the doppler heating rate attains its maximum value for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . above @xmath73w , the doppler heating rate decreases and the cooling effect of the blue sisyphus mechanism increases as the magnitudes of the dressed state energies increase at the anti - nodes of the standing wave .",
    "the minimum temperature achievable with the blue sisyphus mechanism is proportional to the modulation amplitude of the dressed states @xmath77 in the standing wave @xcite ; as the power is further increased , the temperature of the sample increases and eventually becomes commensurate with the trap depth , so that the d2 cooling beams can no longer provide enough cooling to keep the atom trapped .",
    "if one assumes a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the energy of an atom with temperature @xmath78 in the microtrap , integrating the distribution from zero to @xmath79 shows the same trend as this experimental retention probability .    at higher blue detunings , the dip in retention probability at low power",
    "is significantly reduced : shows a small decrease at @xmath80w , and at the retention probability is essentially flat for low power .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that for detunings larger than the natural linewidth , the peak doppler heating rate shifts to higher intensities , where the modulation of the dressed state energies ( eq .  ) is already significant , and thus the cooling effect of the blue sisyphus mechanism predominates over doppler heating .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : blue_spectrum_comp ] , we saw that trap loss can distort the fluorescence signal of a single atom .",
    "however , due to the fact that one atom can be detected with near - unit efficiency , this loss effect could be eliminated by adding additional pictures to the experimental sequence and appropriate post - processing . in the case of fluorescence detection of multiple atoms in a microscopic volume , the process is complicated by rapid two - body loss due to light - assisted collisions between atoms . in previous work",
    "@xcite , we showed that fluorescence imaging using a blue - detuned standing wave of light could be used to count three atoms held in a microtrap based on the unambiguous signature of steps in the integrated fluorescence .",
    "however , this signature is lost when counting larger atomic samples because light - assisted collisions reduce the atom number during a given exposure time , thereby blurring the steps in fluorescence .",
    "thus , to accurately count multiple atoms in a microscopic volume , we must devise additional techniques to mitigate the effects of loss during the imaging sequence .    in our system ,",
    "inelastic light - assisted collisions during fluorescence imaging are the dominant loss mechanism . in general ,",
    "binary collisions between cold alkali atoms in their electronic ground states occur through an induced dipole - dipole interaction , a second order effect with interaction energy given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the inter - atom distance and @xmath83 is the van der waals interaction coefficient @xcite . in the presence of near - resonant light ,",
    "the electronic excited state population is non - zero and atoms can interact via a resonant dipole interaction @xmath84 .",
    "one can estimate the inter - atom distance at which the light is resonant with the two - atom system , the condon point @xmath85 , by @xmath86 .",
    "a typical @xmath87 value is 20  ev@xmath88 , so for @xmath89mhz , @xmath90   . for 100 atoms in the microtrap at @xmath91k ,",
    "the peak density is @xmath92  @xmath3 , and the mean inter - atom distance is @xmath93250   .",
    "thus , in this system the mean inter - atom distance is of the same order as the interaction length , and light - assisted collisions predominate .",

    "<S> we investigate fluorescence detection using a standing wave of blue - detuned light of one or more atoms held in a deep , microscopic dipole trap . </S>",
    "<S> the blue - detuned standing wave realizes a sisyphus laser cooling mechanism so that an atom can scatter many photons while remaining trapped . when imaging more than one atom , the blue detuning limits loss due to inelastic light - assisted collisions . </S>",
    "<S> using this standing wave probe beam , we demonstrate that we can count from one to the order of 100 atoms in the microtrap with sub - poissonian precision . </S>"
