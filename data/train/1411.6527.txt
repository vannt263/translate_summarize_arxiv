    "the notion of resonance was introduced in quantum mechanics to study metastable states of a system , that is long - lived states from which the system deviates only with sufficiently strong disturbances .",
    "mathematically , resonances replace discrete eigenvalues of linear operators on non - compact domains and appear as poles of the meromorphic continuation of their resolvents .    the mathematical study of resonances initiated for schrdinger operators on @xmath3 .",
    "later , it was extended to more geometric situations , such as the laplacian on hyperbolic and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds , symmetric or locally symmetric spaces , and damek - ricci spaces . in a typical situation ,",
    "one works on a complete riemannian manifold @xmath4 , for which the positive laplacian @xmath5 is an essentially self - adjoint operator on the hilbert space @xmath6 of square integrable functions on @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 has a continuous spectrum @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the resolvent @xmath9 of the shifted laplacian ( or helmholtz operator ) @xmath10 is then a holomorphic function of @xmath11 on the upper ( and on the lower ) complex halfplane , with values in the space of bounded linear operators on @xmath6 .",
    "let the resolvent act , not on the entire @xmath6 , but on a dense subspace of @xmath6 , for instance the space @xmath12 of compactly supported smooth functions on @xmath4 or on some suitable weighted @xmath13 space .",
    "then the map @xmath14 might admit a meromorphic extension across @xmath15 to a larger domain in @xmath16 or to a cover of such a domain . the poles , if they exist , are the resonances of @xmath10 .",
    "sometimes also the name scattering poles is used , but the two concepts are not completely synonymous ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the basic questions concern the existence of the meromorphic extension of the resolvent , the distribution and counting properties of the resonances , the rank and interpretation of the residue operators associated with the resonances .",
    "let @xmath17 be a connected noncompact real semisimple lie group with finite center and let @xmath18 be a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath17 .",
    "then the homogeneous space @xmath19 is a riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type .",
    "it is a complete riemannian manifold with respect to its canonical @xmath17-invariant riemannian structure .",
    "the positive laplacian is the opposite of the laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "an important example of such spaces are the real hyperbolic spaces @xmath20 .",
    "the resonances of the positive laplacian on @xmath21 have been studied by guillop and zworski , @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "they proved that there are no resonances for @xmath22 even ; for @xmath22 odd , there are resonances ( which are explicitely determined ) and the corresponding residue operators have finite rank .",
    "the study of the analytic extension of the resolvent of the laplacian for general riemannian symmetric spaces of the noncompact type @xmath19 was started by mazzeo and vasy , @xcite .",
    "the motivations were of different nature .",
    "first of all , these spaces form a natural class of complete riemannian manifolds for which the geometric properties are well understood . moreover",
    ", the analytic properties of their laplace - beltrami operator play an important role in representation theory and number theory .",
    "furthermore , the radial component of the laplace - beltrami operator on a maximal flat subspace is a many - body type hamiltonian , with the walls of weyl chambers of the maximal flat corresponding to the collision planes .",
    "this suggested that many - body methods of geometric scattering theory could have been appropriate to this setting .",
    "more precisely , the analysis carried out in @xcite combines microlocal techniques and an adaptation of the scattering method of complex scaling of aguilar - balslev - combes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a different point of view , using the helgason - fourier analysis , was employed by a. strohmaier , @xcite , and by hilgert and pasquale , @xcite .",
    "a further approach , using asymptotics of solutions the laplacian on damek - ricci spaces , was employed by miatello and will in @xcite .    for a general riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type @xmath19 , mazzeo and vasy @xcite and",
    "strohmaier @xcite independently proved that the resolvent @xmath23 of the shifted laplacian @xmath24 admits a holomorphic extension across @xmath15 .",
    "the domain of the extension depends on the parity of the real rank of the symmetric space @xmath4 ( i.e. the dimension of the maximal flat subspace of @xmath4 ) .",
    "this dependence on the parity of the dimension parallels the case of the laplacian on @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    despite the many articles studying resonances on complete riemannian manifolds , detailed information on the existence and nature of the resonances for the laplacian on @xmath4",
    "is so far available only in the so - called even multiplicity and real rank one cases .",
    "the even multiplicity case corresponds to the situation in which the lie algebra of @xmath25 has a unique class of cartan subalgebras .",
    "this happens for instance when @xmath25 possesses a complex structure . in the even multiplicity case",
    ", the resolvent has an entire extension to a suitable covering of the complex plane , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) .",
    "so there are no resonances in this case .",
    "the general rank - one case was considered , with different approaches , in @xcite and @xcite : unless the symmetric space has even multiplicities ( in which case there are no resonances ) , the map @xmath23 admits a meromorphic extension to @xmath16 with simple poles along the negative imaginary axis .",
    "the poles are at the points @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a constant depending on the normalization of the riemannian measure and the @xmath29 s range among the spectral parameters of the spherical functions @xmath30 on @xmath4 which are matrix coefficients of finite dimensional spherical representations of @xmath17 .",
    "the resolvent residue operator at @xmath31 is a constant multiple of the convolution operator by @xmath30 and its image is the space of the corresponding finite dimensional spherical representation . in particular ,",
    "the rank of the residue operators is finite . see ( *",
    "* theorem 3.8 ) .    in @xcite and @xcite , mazzeo and",
    "vasy considered the specific case of @xmath32 , to exemplify their microlocal and complex - scaling methods of analytic extension of the resolvent of the positive laplacian .",
    "the space @xmath0 is a symmetric space of real rank - two which can be realized as the space of symmetric 3-by-3 positive definite matrices with determinant @xmath33 .",
    "restricted to a maximal flat , its laplace - beltrami operator is a calogero - moser - sutherland 3-body hamiltonian of type ii associated with the root system @xmath34 , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.1.14 ) and ( 3.8.3 ) ) . the analysis of @xcite and @xcite left nevertheless open the basic questions on the existence and nature of resonances and resolvent residue operators .    in this paper",
    "we provide complete answers to these questions . in a first step one",
    "notices that for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36 the resolvent function @xmath37 extends holomorphically to @xmath38 \\cup i(-\\infty , -\\frac{1}{2}{\\rho_\\x}]\\big)$ ] .",
    "the cut @xmath39 $ ] leads to a logarithmic riemann surface covering @xmath40\\cup \\{0\\}\\cup   i[\\tfrac{1}{2}{\\rho_\\x},+\\infty)\\big)$ ] to which @xmath41 can be lifted holomorphically ( see corollary  [ cor : logriemann ] ) .",
    "this narrows down the location of the resonances to the negative imaginary axis .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ thm : meroextshiftedlaplacian ] , then says that for each @xmath42 there is an open neighborhood of @xmath43 together with a branched cover @xmath44 to which @xmath37 can be lifted meromorphically .",
    "poles can occur only above the points @xmath45 , and they are of order at most one .",
    "for special @xmath46 and @xmath47 the lift may be holomorphic at some of these points .",
    "obviously this is the case for @xmath48 .",
    "the residues of the lifted functions may be calculated and they are given as convolution of @xmath46 with the spherical function whose spectral parameter is the resonance .",
    "unlike the rank one case , the residue resolvent operators are not of finite rank ( see proposition  [ prop : eigenspaces ] ) . on the other hand , as in the rank one case",
    "the range of each of the residue operator is a @xmath17-representation which can be identified explicitly .",
    "more precisely , it is the unique irreducible subquotient of a ( non - unitary ) principal series whose langlands parameter can be read off from the resonance ( see proposition  [ the range of the residue operator ] ) . since the unitary dual of @xmath2 is known , we are able to detect the unique resonance for which the corresponding representation is unitarizable . unfortunately the spherical unitary dual of some other real rank",
    "two semisimple groups was not classified yet .",
    "thus in these cases the question of unitarizibility of the residue representations will be more difficult .",
    "we are not aware of any place in the literature where the authors actually prove that any residue operators have infinite rank .",
    "typically one uses analytic fredholm theory to show that these operators are of finite rank .",
    "the fredholm theory is not applicable in the case we consider .",
    "instead we use langlands classification to show that the rank is infinite .",
    "alternatively , the range of the residue operator at some resonance is given by the differential equations which determine the image of the poisson transform associated with this resonance ( see remark  [ rem : poisson2 ] ) .    in order to compute the residues ,",
    "initially we tried to reduce the problem from rank two to the rank one , considered in @xcite , by pursuing a double rank - one integration and deforming the real line to an unbounded cycle in the complex plane .",
    "however this method leads to technical difficulties .",
    "instead we decided to use polar coordinates , deforming a circle to an ellipse , see section [ subsection : deformations1 ] , and get directly to the result .",
    "since the laplacian has rotational symmetry this is a natural approach , which was used in the euclidean case to show that there are no residues on @xmath49 despite the fact that there is a simple pole at zero for @xmath50 , see @xcite .",
    "these computations lead quickly to a local meromorphic extensions of the resolvent , see section [ subsection : meroextgn ] .",
    "we glue them together in order to get an explicit global extension .",
    "this is a non - trivial process , described in sections [ subsection : mero - ext - f ] and [ subsection : mero - ext - resolvent ] .",
    "we shall use the standard notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath15 , @xmath53 , @xmath16 and @xmath54 for the integers , the nonnegative integers , the reals , the positive reals , the complex numbers and the non - zero complex numbers , respectively .",
