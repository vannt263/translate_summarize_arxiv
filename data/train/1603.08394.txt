    "when and how did massive quiescent or evolved galaxies like present - day elliptical galaxies form ? according to the current @xmath17 cold dark matter paradigm , dark matter halos grow by assembling material from their neighborhood , or by merging with other halos .",
    "this view is supported by cosmological simulations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the growth of galaxies , the baryonic components of the halos , seems not to proceed in a simple bottom - up manner .",
    "observations have shown that many of the most massive galaxies ( m@xmath18 @xmath19 10@xmath20m@xmath5 ) in the local universe assembled quickly and at early epochs ( @xmath21 ) while less massive galaxies grew more gradually @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the baryonic physics of galaxy formation involves more than just cooling and accretion of gas at a rate dictated by gravity .    in order to understand the balance among several processes in galaxy formation [ major / minor mergers , harassment , feedback by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or supernovae , cold gas accretion , and so on ]",
    ", it is important to unravel the relationship among different galaxy populations such as actively star forming galaxies , quiescent galaxies , and agns .",
    "the first quiescent galaxies to emerge are especially interesting because their redshifts and masses will have much to say about the history of galaxy formation and star formation activity in the very early universe .",
    "however , our present knowledge of galaxies at these epochs are based primarily on star - forming galaxies and agns , due to the limited sensitivity and volume of surveys carried out to - date , as well as an intrinsic rarity of quiescent galaxies at high redshift @xcite . a new",
    ", larger sample of quiescent galaxies at higher redshift is needed to obtain a more complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution at early epochs .",
    "in contrast with star - forming galaxies , which typically exhibit numerous emission lines or strong lyman breaks , quiescent galaxies are relatively difficult to be identified at high redshift because of their nearly featureless spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the balmer/4000- - break is the only strong feature in the seds of quiescent galaxies , and it has long been used to identify them at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "for example , objects with @xmath23 or @xmath24 in the vega magnitude system select elliptical galaxies with a strong 4000 - break at @xmath25 ( extremely red objects : eros ; @xcite ) .",
    "this ero selection was extended to higher redshift , @xmath26 , by adopting the red @xmath27 $ ] color criterion ( @xmath28 , irac - selected extremely red object ( iero ) ; @xcite ] .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) color criterion @xmath29 ( vega ) is often used to select quiescent galaxies at @xmath30 ( distant red galaxies : drgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "while dusty star - forming galaxies also satisfy these simple @xmath31 and @xmath32 color criteria , a substantial fraction of eros and drgs are spectroscopically confirmed to be passively evolved galaxies @xcite .",
    "as spectroscopy is time - consuming , many authors have instead separated passive and dusty star - forming galaxies photometrically using two colors so that one color brackets the balmer break and the other color represents the shape of spectrum at longer wavelengths . the @xmath33 color selection [ @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the vega magnitude system ] is similar to the drg selection , but more sensitive to the evolved galaxy population at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that passive and dust - obscured galaxies at @xmath21 separate well in the @xmath37 vs. @xmath38 $ ] two color diagram @xcite .",
    "recently , rest - frame @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( rest-@xmath41 ) color selection is favored , which allows us to distinguish passive galaxies from star - forming galaxies independently of their redshifts as long as sed fitting works well @xcite .    at @xmath42 , the balmer/4000  break",
    "is shifted to @xmath43 m , and detecting quiescent galaxies at those redshifts is a challenging task . however , some candidates at @xmath44 have been found in extremely deep nir and ir surveys @xcite .",

    "huang et al . ( 2011 ) argued that the four extremely red objects are likely distant passive galaxies rather than nearby dusty galaxies , because their multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) 24-@xmath47 m fluxes are weaker than expected if their rest - infrared seds are similar to those of the central region of m82 ( a local dusty galaxy with @xmath48 ) or those of the dust obscured galaxies ( dogs ) at @xmath49 . employing a similar strategy",

    "the survey volume was calculated from the seds area ( 0.34deg@xmath3 ) and the redshift range ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "their classification of quiescent and star - forming galaxies using rest @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors is qualitatively similar with our bbg selection , in the sense that both selections aim to isolate galaxies with red color by balmer breaks and blue color in longer wavelength than balmer breaks .",
    "we estimated the stellar mass densities at @xmath101 by integrating their stellar mass functions down to @xmath103m@xmath104m@xmath112 , which equals the stellar mass lower limit assumed for our bbg sample .",

    "for the 15 quiescent galaxies at @xmath91 , we adopted our stellar mass limit to calculate the stellar mass density .",
    "we show these stellar mass densities of quiescent galaxies with @xmath103m@xmath104m@xmath105 in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the stellar mass density at @xmath16 revealed in this paper is much lower than that at @xmath114 and consistent with the trend that the stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies decrease continuously with increasing redshift .",
    "we also compared the stellar mass density of evolved galaxies at @xmath0 with those of @xcite .",
    "the color selection of @xcite for bbgs at @xmath0 is similar to our bbg selection in which case they require red @xmath2 $ ] colors , but different from our because they remove the lower redshift contaminations by using the blueward colors ( @xmath32 and @xmath46 $ ] ) instead of @xmath59 - [ 4.5]$ ] .",
    "they identified four candidates for evolved galaxies at @xmath106 without the 24@xmath47 m detection in the 0.04deg@xmath3 area of the goods - south field which have the physical properties similar to ours : @xmath115 and @xmath116gyr . the stellar mass density after correcting the detection incompleteness is @xmath117m@xmath7mpc@xmath15 , which is much more than our measurement ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we can not give a conclusive explanation for this inconsistency , although it is partially due to the fact that they did not use the nebular line emitter templates .",
    "in figure [ fig8 ] , the stellar mass densities of star - forming galaxies are also plotted ; they were estimated by integrating the stellar mass functions of star - forming galaxies at @xmath101 @xcite and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath44 @xcite down to @xmath103m@xmath104m@xmath112 .",
    "from these , we estimated the quiescent fraction , which is defined as the fraction of stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies compared with the total stellar mass density . here",
    "we assume the sum of stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies and star - forming galaxies ( lbg at @xmath118 ) as the total stellar mass density .",
    "the quiescent fraction at @xmath16 is only @xmath119 , which is much lower than @xmath120 at @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that evolved galaxies do not dominate the massive end of stellar mass functions at @xmath100 .",
    "such rare but non - zero evolved galaxies are naturally considered to be embedded in prominent massive halos , because both theoretical works ( e.g. , @xcite ) and observations @xcite suggested that mass assembly and quenching of galaxies preferentially proceeded in the proto - cluster regions .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate the surrounding environments of the evolved galaxy candidates individually in future .       as a function of duty cycle .",
    "duty cycle for `` maximum starburst '' smgs are estimated from their star - forming timescale .",
    "the expected region for progenitor of evolved galaxies is shown by grey shading .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    finally , we discuss the progenitor of the evolved galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "our finding of evolved galaxies at @xmath100 strongly suggests intense starburst in these systems at much larger redshift .",
    "submilimeter - selected galaxies ( smgs ) are considered as possible progenitors , because their dust - obscured star formation is much more active than that of uv - selected star - forming galaxies which leads to rapid consumption of gas and subsequent quenching @xcite .",
    "although very few smgs with spectroscopic redshifts are available above @xmath121 , the object hfls3 @xcite may be a good example of a progenitor of the evolved galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "hfls3 was identified by ultra red colors in the herschel spire wavelength range ( @xmath122 m ) , and its redshift was determined to be @xmath123 based on several emission lines @xcite .",
    "they found that hfl3 has an extremely high sfr ( @xmath124m@xmath5yr@xmath8 ) , a large amount of gas ( @xmath125m@xmath5 ) , and large stellar mass ( @xmath126m@xmath5 ) .",
    "these quantities are not changed very much even if the lensing magnification by the two foreground galaxies is taken into account @xcite .",
    "although the gas depletion timescale of hfls3 is 36myr , star formation may be suppressed on a shorter timescale ( @xmath127myr ) because of supernova ( and agn ) feedback . if hfls3 continue to produce stars with sfr@xmath128m@xmath5yr@xmath8 for 10myr and experiences subsequent passive evolution , it should become bbg with m@xmath129m@xmath5 and age @xmath130gyr at @xmath131 , which is consistent with stellar mass and age of our evolved galaxy candidates within the @xmath132 uncertainties .",
    "this suggests that the most active starburst ( or `` maximum starburst '' ) smgs can be progenitors of evolved galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we also checked their abundances .",
    "the expected number density of progenitors depends on their duty cycle .",
    "we here define duty cycle as the ratio of the time duration for which galaxies can be detected to the time interval that corresponds to the searched redshift range .",
    "once galaxies are quenched , they can be observed as evolved galaxies at all times , which means that the duty cycle of evolved galaxies is 100% . if a progenitor has a duty cycle of 100% , the expected number density should be same as the observed number density of evolved galaxies , @xmath133mpc@xmath15 .",
    "but the duty cycle of a star - forming progenitor may be small , because the time duration for which it was in active star - forming phase is expected to be short .",
    "the number density of such a progenitor should be @xmath133mpc@xmath134duty - cycle .",
    "for `` maximum starburst '' smgs such as hfls3 , we adopt the following simple assumptions",
    ". intrinsic redshift distribution is flat at @xmath106 .",
    "completeness of the herschel observation of @xcite , which is a part of hermes @xcite in the first look survey ( fls ) field , locman hole , and goods - north fields , for galaxies analog to hfls3 at @xmath106 is 0.6 .",
    "this completeness is consistent with that estimated in @xcite for objects with flux of 30mjy at 500@xmath47 m ( flux limit of @xcite ) .",
    "observed time interval corresponding to @xmath106 is 0.42gyr , and star - formation timescale of hfls3 is @xmath135myr .",
    "these assumptions lead to a spatial number density of @xmath136mpc@xmath15 and duty cycle of @xmath137% for `` maximum starburst '' smgs at @xmath106 .",
    "the number densities of `` maximum starburst '' smgs at @xmath106 and expected progenitor as a function of duty cycle are shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "the number density of `` maximum starburst '' smgs is consistent with that of expected progenitors .",
    "@xcite reported on the four analogs of hfls3 , which have similar red herschel spire colors .",
    "they may explain the small difference between the number density of `` maximum starburst '' smgs and expected progenitors , while there are large uncertainties caused by the simple assumptions .",
    "the picture that star - formation in the progenitor of evolved galaxies at @xmath0 rapidly proceeds surrounded with dust is a natural extension of the picture for lower - redshift , quiescent galaxies @xcite .",

    "this stellar mass density of evolved galaxies at @xmath106 is consistent with the declining trend previously observed within a range of @xmath144 .",

    "<S> we report on the identification of the old stellar population galaxy candidates at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a new infrared color selection scheme to isolate galaxies with the strong balmer breaks at @xmath0 , and applied it to the ultra - deep and wide infrared survey data from the @xmath1 extended deep survey ( seds ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> the eight objects satisfying @xmath2 > 1.3 $ ] and @xmath2 > 2.4 ( [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] ) + 0.6 $ ] are selected in the 0.34 deg@xmath3 seds ultra deep survey field . </S>",
    "<S> rich multi - wavelength imaging data from optical to far - infrared are also used to reject blending sources and strong nebular line emitters , and we finally obtained the three most likely evolved galaxies at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> their stacked spectral energy distribution is fitted well with the old stellar population template with m@xmath4m@xmath5 , star formation rate @xmath6m@xmath7yr@xmath8 , dust @xmath9 , and age @xmath10gyr at @xmath11 , where the dusty star - forming galaxies at @xmath12 is disfavored because of the faintness in the @xmath13 m . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass density of these evolved galaxy candidates , @xmath14m@xmath5mpc@xmath15 , is much lower than that of star - forming galaxies , but the non - zero fraction suggests that initial star - formation and quenching have been completed by @xmath16 . </S>"
