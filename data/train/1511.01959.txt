    "the existence of a metastable liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) in deeply supercooled water was posited by poole et al.@xcite more than two decades ago on the basis of numerical evidence from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the st2 water model @xcite .",
    "the preponderance of evidence from subsequent computational studies supports this hypothesis @xcite , suggesting that st2 phase - separates into a high - density liquid ( hdl ) and a low - density liquid ( ldl ) at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "an alternative hypothesis @xcite argues , however , that reported signatures of the llpt in st2 and other water models @xcite are non - equilibrium artifacts associated with crystallization . according to the _ artificial polyamorphism _ hypothesis ( aph ) @xcite , all previous reports of llpt - like behavior occur at temperatures near the stability limit of the liquid @xmath0 , in a regime where crystallization occurs by a sluggish coarsening process .",
    "large density fluctuations during coarsening give rise to the illusion of an ldl - like phase with a density similar to that of the stable crystal .",
    "this behavior would then arise from a purported separation of relaxation time scales in which fluctuations in density relax rapidly compared to those associated with bond - orientational order .",
    "thus , the aph argues that the ldl is a transient manifestation of the burgeoning ice phase that has equilibrated its density , but not its bond - orientational order @xcite .",
    "although the aph is supported by some free energy calculations @xcite for the st2 model showing evidence of only a single liquid phase in approximate coexistence with cubic ice near the reported llpt , these findings are in direct conflict with recent computational investigations @xcite , and they have not been independently verified .    the aph is inconsistent with findings from our recent study of st2 water @xcite showing evidence of hdl - ldl in coexistence at deeply supercooled conditions .",
    "in particular , the free energy surface in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the ldl persists after relaxing all fluctuations accessible to the system by sampling reversibly _ back and forth _ between the liquid and crystal regions .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to the predictions of the aph .",
    "the salient features of our free energy results have been independently verified by several research groups @xcite , and we have carefully scrutinized their accuracy using six different computational techniques @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic analysis shows that the free energy difference between the liquids and the stable ice phase predicted by our simulations is consistent with expectations based on an accurate empirical equation of state for real water @xcite .",
    "the llpt in st2 also exhibits scaling behavior consistent with a first - order transition over the range of system sizes whose free energy surfaces can be calculated with currently available computational resources @xcite . furthermore , smallenburg and sciortino @xcite recently demonstrated that by adjusting a single model parameter , the bond flexibility , the llpt in st2 can be traced in a continuous fashion to a thermodynamically stable liquid - liquid transition .",
    "their findings therefore exclude the possibility that crystallization could be mistaken for an llpt and confirm the reversible nature of our calculations @xcite .",
    "recent work by these authors also shows that llpts are an inherent property of fluids with interpenetrating tetrahedral networks similar to those found in st2 water @xcite .",
    "our study @xcite shows that signatures of the llpt in st2 are reversible and do not slowly disappear over time or vanish when sampling is performed to and from the crystal region , as incorrectly predicted by the aph @xcite .",
    "we are , however , unaware of computational studies that have systematically examined the physical assumption underlying this hypothesis , namely that density fluctuations relax rapidly compared to those associated with bond - orientational order . here , we use molecular simulation to characterize the relaxation behavior of four different water models : st2 , tip5p , tip4p/2005 and mw . following previous studies @xcite , we characterize the relaxation of fluctuations by computing autocorrelation functions ( @xmath1 , acfs ) for the molecular density of the system , @xmath2 , and the nelson - steinhardt - ronchetti bond - orientational order parameter , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 quantifies the extent of bond - orientational coherence in the system , and it assumes typical values @xmath4 and @xmath5 for configurations with liquid- and crystal - like symmetry , respectively . according to the aph @xcite , @xmath6 in deeply supercooled water , where @xmath7 is the characteristic relaxation time computed by integrating over the acf . for each water model , in contrast , we observe that @xmath8 , which suggests the aph is fundamentally inconsistent with the relaxation dynamics of deeply supercooled water .",
    "we first examine st2 , which is the only water model where an llpt has been identified using rigorous free energy techniques designed to investigate phase transitions .",
    "there are several variants of st2 that differ in their treatment of long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "the ewald variant described in our recent study @xcite , namely one involving the ewald summation and vacuum boundary conditions , henceforth denoted st2-ew(v)^*^ , is identical to the model employed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite ( st2-ew(v ) ) , except that long - range corrections to the lennard - jones interactions are neglected . our previous calculations with this model",
    "demonstrate that density and bond - orientational relaxations are highly coupled in the ldl region @xcite .",
    "the aph , however , is concerned with relaxation behavior at higher densities @xcite near the hdl basin reported in our study @xcite .",
    "this is because the putative physical picture underlying the aph is that of rapid density fluctuations in hdl causing the transient appearance of ldl , which subsequently and slowly gives rise to the stable crystal phase via slow equilibration of @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast , unrestrained npt md simulations of st2-ew(v)^*^ reveal that fluctuations in @xmath2 relax considerably more slowly than those in @xmath3 in the hdl at 228.6 k and 2.4 kbar ( figure [ figure1 : fig1 ] ) , which is the same condition where we previously demonstrated metastable phase separation in this model @xcite .",
    "the system remains liquid - like over the course of the md simulations as evidenced by the fact that @xmath9 .",
    "although some statistical noise is observed in the tails of the acfs due to sampling over a finite period of time , they fluctuate about zero at long times , demonstrating that they are well - converged .",
    "such convergence is possible under these conditions because the barrier separating hdl and ldl is ca .",
