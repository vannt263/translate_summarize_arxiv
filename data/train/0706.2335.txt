    "the wave function of two fermions is antisymmetric under exchange of the two particles , as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle . for this reason ,",
    "the probability amplitude for their being spatially close together is small and their correlated detections are reduced when compared to a random sequence of classical particles .",
    "this very distinctive quantum feature is named antibunching and has no classical analog .",
    "notice that in general the two particles can be emitted from totally incoherent sources .",
    "the analogous phenomenon for bosons is a cornerstone in the study of quantum correlations and was first observed in astronomy , where it is known as the hanbury brown - twiss effect @xcite .",
    "photon second - order coherence effects @xcite , yielding bunching , are discussed in physics textbooks @xcite , and led to novel interesting applications in quantum imaging @xcite and lithography @xcite .",
    "the most relevant difference between the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics are the phase space densities ( occupation numbers ) , that change by several orders of magnitude . in a laser beam ,",
    "one obtains values of order @xmath0 , while typical densities for thermal light , synchrotron radiation and electrons are of order @xmath1 ; finally , for the most advanced neutron sources , one gets @xmath2 .",
    "these figures make it very difficult to observe fermion antibunching .",
    "in addition , for charged particles ( electrons and pions ) , additional coulomb repulsion effects should be considered , that tend to reduce the visibility and mask the observation of the phenomenon .",
    "quantum correlations have been detected in a series of interesting experiments : in condensed - matter physics , where the electronic states are confined within the fermi surface @xcite , for superconductor emitters @xcite , in the coincidence spectrum of neutrons from compound - nuclear reactions at small relative momentum @xcite , as well as in pion pairs emitted from a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "recently , antibunching was observed on a beam of thermal neutrons emitted from a nuclear reactor @xcite .",
    "this can be considered as a direct experimental evidence of free fermion antibunching , in which an ensemble of free fermi particles displays quantum coherence effects .",
    "other remarkable antibunching experiments have been recently reported for neutral atoms , both in a degenerate atomic fermi gas @xcite and in fermi / bose gases @xcite .",
    "huge numerical differences in phase space densities , like the afore - mentioned ones , call for close scrutiny of the theoretical premises as well as dedicated experimental efforts . notice that these quantum statistical effects appear to play a prominent role in phenomena that are characterized by figures that differ by almost 30 ( ! ) orders of magnitude .",
    "the present study is motivated by this observation .",
    "we intend to analyze the antibunching phenomenon in the correlated detections of two neutral fermions , such as neutrons , emitted by a generic thermal source at a given temperature .",
    "notice that bunching effects from ( pseudo-)thermal sources still raise controversial interpretations @xcite and are therefore worth investigating from first principles .",
    "our main objective will be to analyze the spatial coherence and in particular the coherence area and volume .",
    "lateral effects are becoming a critical issue , in view of a new generation of experiments .",
    "they were carefully analyzed in a series of experimental articles on x - ray bunching @xcite .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we will focus on fermions , but our analysis can be very easily extended to bosons ( by replacing the energy distributions of the source and changing relevant signs in the formulas ) .",
    "we will treat both the source ( a thermal oven ) and the particle beam as fully ( second ) quantized systems and will study the emission process at thermal equilibrium , when the beam has reached its stationary configuration .",
    "this approach will have the advantage of treating both the oven and the fermion beam on an equal footing and of introducing the properties of the source in a natural way .",
    "before starting a detailed analysis , let us outline the main features of the setup we have in mind and stress the main points of our argument .",
    "our setup is the simple one schematically shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "particles are emitted from a source through a small window , go through a monochromator ( not shown ) , and are detected by two detectors .",
    "we count the number of coincident detections . at the initial time",
    "@xmath3 , the source is in the thermal equilibrium state at a finite temperature and outside there is the vacuum . starting from this initial condition , we shall solve the dynamics of the emission , so that a stationary beam of particles will be prepared at @xmath4 , after a transient period .",
    "the beam profile will not be added  by hand , \" but will be obtained by solving the equations of motion , so that the coherence properties of the emitted particles will reflect the dynamics of the emission .",
    "the lateral features of the system affect the antibunching , even when both detectors are placed on the longitudinal axis and we shall look at the correlation in the longitudinal direction . to this end , the lateral size of the detector mouth must be duly taken into account .",
    "we shall therefore implement the lateral resolution of the detector , as well as the longitudinal one , in the two - particle distribution function .",
    "the variables and parameters that characterize the setup are summarized in table [ tab_corr ] .",
    "we shall start by writing down the hamiltonian of this many - body system in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] .",
    "this is the crucial part of the present analysis , since it fully relies on dynamical consideration . in order to facilitate the introduction of the characteristics of the source , like temperature , size of the window , and so on , in a natural way",
    ", we shall adopt a two - field approach : one field describes the particles in the source and the other one the emitted particles outside .",
    "the emission hamiltonian @xmath5 ( which converts a particle in the source into a particle outside and _ vice versa _ ) is at the heart of our analysis and must fully take into account all important features of the experimental setup , as well as the main characteristics of the physics of the emission process .",
    "the hamiltonian below will enable us to discuss the lateral coherence features of the emitted beam , yet it will be simple enough to be ( almost ) solvable . as we will see , the diffraction of the particles emitted through the window governs the lateral coherence and is controlled by the lateral size of the emitting window .",
    "once the hamiltonian is written down , one has  only \" to solve the equations of motion ( and has no  freedom \" anymore ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the dynamics of the emission is perturbatively solved in sec.[sec - dynamica ] , under the assumption of weak emissivity , namely weak coupling @xmath6 , and the stationary limit @xmath4 realizes a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "the beam profile thus prepared is studied at a large distance from the source in sec .",
    "[ sec - beamprof ] .",
    "we then compute the two - particle distribution function , or in other words , the second - order correlation function , defined in sec.[sec - antib ] .",
    "the interplay between the singlet and triplet contributions determines to which extent the coincidence counts are reduced ( antibunching ) when the two detectors are close to each other .",
    "indeed , the singlet contribution yields bunching and the triplet one antibunching , with the latter three times larger than the former .",
    "the detector sizes ( resolutions ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 are implemented into the correlation functions , the saddle - point approximation is carefully worked out for the case in which the detectors are placed on the longitudinal @xmath9 axis , and we obtain a formula for the normalized two - particle distribution function . the noncollinear case , with the two detectors placed off the longitudinal axis , is also discussed .",
    "the antibunching is then discussed and the coherence properties are clarified in sec .",
    "[ sec : tempeff ] , on the basis of our formula for the collinear case , and the effect of the temperature of the source is scrutinized .",
    "the temperature effect is shown to be very weak .",
    "the dependence of the antibunching correlation function on the distance between the two detectors is found to be controlled by the lateral monochromator window and the longitudinal detector resolution , while the magnitude of the antibunching effect is determined by the lateral size of the source .",
    "finally , a variety of experiments are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : exps ] , in the light of the lateral coherence , and the main results are summarized in sec.[sec - concl ] .",
    ".summary of the variables and parameters used in the calculation .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     another interesting experiment is that performed with x - rays @xcite .",
    "an important part of this experiment is devoted to the analysis of the lateral coherence features of the beam .",
    "the setup involves the values @xmath10 , @xmath11 , while the detector size was changed in the range @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "the authors observed a reduction of the bunching peak very similar to that described in our fig.[fig : lateral](b ) , as a function of the size of the detector mouth @xmath7 , and estimated the lateral coherence length of the beam from the width of the plot , obtaining a source size of order @xmath14 .",
    "the longitudinal coherence length is known to be @xmath15 , while the length of the photon bunch is @xmath16 : by plugging these values in our eq .",
    "( [ eqn : analytical ] ) , the first factor is @xmath17 for @xmath18 , while the second one is @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 , which explain well the observed data ( a positive bump @xmath21 . )    finally , it is interesting to look at some experiments done with thermal optical photon , in order to study both their correlations and imaging .",
    "experiments of this kind were widely debated during the last few years @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on the experiment @xcite , in which the source is a he - ne laser ( in other similar experiments a green - doubled nd : yag laser was used ) .",
    "one estimates @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the pseudothermal source is obtained by randomizing the phase of the photon field by means of a rotating ground - glass disk ( so that the expression random source would probably be more appropriate ) . the first factor in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : analytical ] ) is therefore @xmath26 while the second one is essentially 1 ( @xmath27 , yielding @xmath28 , which is to be compared to the much larger coherence length of the laser ) .",
    "this yields an overall dip of good visibility .",
    "unfortunately a quantitative comparison with the experimental data is difficult because the authors , being interested in the change of the width of the second order correlation function with the source size , only plotted a _",
    "( re)normalized _ correlation function .",
    "this brief summary of experimental data shows that our analysis and final formulas agree well with most experiments performed so far , with different particles . in some cases a comparison is more complicated and/or requires additional information .",
    "one phenomenon that we find of interest , but still lacks experimental confirmation , is our prediction that for fermionic systems we expect that the visibility of second - order interference effects should show _ no dependence on temperature _ , as explained in fig.[fig : temp ] .",
    "we emphasized at the end of sec.[sec : tempeff ] that this is due to the exactness of pauli s principle ( yielding perfect antisymmetrization ) even for mixed states .",
    "we analyzed antibunching in a beam of non - interacting fermions and investigated the behavior of the visibility as a function of the size of the source and the detectors , as well as the temperature of the source .",
    "these parameters are critical and play a prominent role in experimental applications .",
    "our analysis makes use of gaussian functions both for the emitting region of the source and the detector , and is adapted to an approximately cylindrically symmetric situation , with circular detector placed close to the longitudinal axis .",
    "this is the relevant situation in most experiments , in particular with neutrons and electrons ( where however additional coulomb effects , as well as more specific emission features of the source need to be scrutinized ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in the observation of pion correlations @xcite the experimental data have been exploited to determine the dimension and the expansion dynamics of the pion  source \" ( fireball produced in central pb - pb collisions , which is expected to be a droplet of quark gluon plasma at the freeze - out point ) .",
    "clearly , our approach can prove to be quite useful in such a situation as well , when source size and temperature are not known .",
    "let us look at possible applications and future perspectives .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that although our analysis was performed for fermions , all formulas can be easily translated to the case of bosons , enabling one to scrutinize interesting novel experiments in quantum imaging and lithography .",
    "some recent applications make use of chaotic or pseudo - thermal light sources , to which our formalism immediately applies @xcite .",
    "other possible applications are in solid state physics , where , as a consequences of the symmetrization procedure of the many - body wave function , entanglement should be present in bulk matter , raising delicate problems in relation to its detection and extraction @xcite .",
    "since one should get entangled neutron pairs within the coherence volume of the wave packet ( antibunching being observed within the same coherence volume ) , these pairs could be used as very efficient  probes \" for entanglement in solids in future experiments .",
    "this is clearly relevant for quantum information processing and for tests of the bell inequalities .    finally , we mention some interesting speculations in neutrino physics and the structure of the universe , where , as a consequence of entanglement formation , the hypothesis of a collisionless fluid of classical point particles can be critically re - examined , yielding a  quantum overpressure , \" with significant consequences during the non - linear structure formation epoch at low redshifts @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that independent ideas can bear consequences in very diverse fields .",
