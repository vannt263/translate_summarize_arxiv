    "neural systems in many cases are characterized by oscillatory behavior @xcite , which is often quite complicated @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that neural oscillatory dynamics can have different origins , being either self - sustained @xcite , or induced by random fluctuations alone @xcite .",
    "these oscillations can also be multimodal , i.e. , consisting of several components with different prominent timescales .",
    "for example the thalamocortical relay neurons can generate either spindle or @xmath0 oscillations @xcite , whereas the electro - receptors in a paddle fish are able to generate biperiodic oscillations @xcite .",
    "coupled neurons are able to demonstrate synchronization , which plays a very important role in neurodynamics , having either constructive , or destructive effects depending on the circumstances .    on one hand , the ensembles of different neurons can be synchronized in order to process biological information , i.e. , this synchronization might be beneficial for a more efficient data transmission @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , these synchronized neurons can induce a regular , rhythmic activity , which is believed to play a crucial role in the emergence of pathological rhythmic brain activity in parkinson s disease , essential tremor , and epilepsy @xcite . in both situations ,",
    "synchronization phenomena occur spontaneously , and the mechanisms behind them are the subjects of intensive research @xcite . hence , the development of techniques that would allow one to manipulate the neural synchrony is an important clinical problem .    starting with the work of ott , grebogi and yorke @xcite , a variety of methods for the control of irregular behavior have been developed in the last 15 years @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of methods have been proposed for suppression of synchrony in the arrays of coupled oscillators in which oscillations are self - sustained @xcite . however , the problem of control of the dynamics in coupled systems where oscillations are induced merely by random fluctuations is still open .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of using for this purpose the delayed feedback scheme introduced by pyragas @xcite : it constructs a control force from the difference between the current state of the system and its state some @xmath1 time units ago .",
    "this method is known as _ time - delay autosynchronization _",
    "it has been applied to control of deterministic chaos in a wide range of systems including spatially extended models , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that it can be used to control the coherence and the timescales of noise - induced oscillations in a single system @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction has recently been verified experimentally in an electrochemical oscillator system @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to extend time - delayed feedback control of noise - induced dynamics to _ coupled _ excitable systems , and investigate if _ local _ control applied to a subsystem can allow one to steer the _",
    "global _ cooperative dynamics in a system of coupled neural oscillators . in particular , we are interested in the study of the effects of delayed feedback on the _ synchrony _ properties in coupled neuron systems .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : system ]",
    "we introduce the model system used , and discuss the properties of their cooperative behavior without control .",
    "in section  [ sec : control ] we study the effects of local delayed feedback control on the global behavior of coupled systems . in section  [ sec : sum ] the results are summarized and the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in order to grasp the complicated interaction between billions of neurons in large neural networks , those are often lumped into groups of neural populations each of which can be represented as an effective excitable element that is mutually coupled to the other elements @xcite . in this sense the simplest model which may reveal features of interacting neurons consists of two coupled neural oscillators . each of these will be represented by a simplified fitzhugh - nagumo system , which is often used as a paradigmatic generic model for neurons , or more generally , excitable systems @xcite . here",
    "we use two fitzhugh - nagumo systems with substantially different intrinsic timescales , and parameters corresponding to the excitable regime . before attempting to control their global dynamics with locally applied feedback",
    ", we will first study the dynamics of the uncontrolled coupled system .",
    "the dynamical equations are given by : @xmath2 where subsystems eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fhnc2 ] ) represent two different neurons , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) describing the transmembrane voltages and @xmath5 modelling the behavior of several physical quantities related to electrical conductances of the relevant ion currents across the respective membranes . here",
    "@xmath6 is a bifurcation parameter whose value defines whether the system is excitable or demonstrates periodic firing ( autonomous oscillations ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive parameters that are usually chosen to be much smaller than unity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent sources of gaussian white noise with zero mean and unity variance , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are noise intensities .",
    "the synaptic coupling between two neurons is modelled as a diffusive coupling considered for simplicity to be symmetric @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath13 summarizes how information is distributed between neurons .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to the range of the parameter values where without noise each of the two subsystems exhibits excitability with only one attractor in the form of a stable fixed point .",
    "noise sources @xmath14 and @xmath15 model random inputs that represent integral signals coming from the part of the neural network or of the environment with which the neuron is connected .",
    "since the neurons can be coupled to different parts of the neural network or of the environment , the noise intensities in the two systems can be quite different .",
    "let us illustrate the dynamics of a single neuron model by considering an uncoupled subsystem eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) ( @xmath13@xmath16@xmath17 ) under the influence of noise .",
    "we arbitrarily fix @xmath18@xmath16@xmath19 , and also set @xmath20 , @xmath7@xmath16@xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp](a ) dashed lines show the null - clines of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) that intersect at a fixed point marked by a white circle .",
    "the phase point that is initially placed at the fixed point stays in its close vicinity if the applied random perturbation remains small .",
    "however , if the perturbation is larger than some threshold value , the phase point makes a large excursion in the phase space before returning to the vicinity of the fixed point again . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp](a ) the black solid line illustrates a phase portrait and in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp](b ) realizations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 time series from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) are shown .",
    "the motion of the phase point consists of two stages : an activation time during which the system waits for a sufficiently large perturbation before it can make an excursion , and the excursion itself .",
    "the excursion time is almost completely defined by the deterministic properties of the system and is hardly influenced by noise .    on the contrary ,",
    "the activation time is completely determined by the properties of noise if all other parameters are fixed : the stronger the noise , the smaller the activation time and the larger the mean frequency of noise - induced oscillations is .",
    "thus , the noise strengths @xmath18 and @xmath24 control the average frequencies of noise - induced oscillations in the systems eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fhnc2 ] ) , respectively , and the difference between them defines the mean frequency detuning between the systems .      before studying the effects of delayed feedback control on the model eqs . ( [ eqn : fhnc1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fhnc2 ] ) , let us examine the basic features of cooperative dynamics of two systems in which oscillations are induced merely by noise .",
    "the cooperative dynamics of a system of coupled stochastic oscillators can be characterized differently depending on the feature of interest .",
    "the most popular features are timescales involved , degree of order in each partial subsystem and in the system of coupled oscillators as a whole , and the degree of synchronism between the subsystems . to quantitatively characterize each feature of interest",
    ", a number of criteria can be used , and here we will choose those that seem to suit best our purposes .    *",
    "* the fourier power spectral density , to which in the following we will refer as _ spectrum _ for brevity , seems to be the most universal and sensitive tool that allows one to fully reveal the frequency content of random oscillations and thus characterize the timescales involved .",
    "the central frequencies of the highest spectral peaks will characterize the timescales involved .",
    "another convenient and less computationally expensive way to characterize the timescales of oscillations is to introduce the interspike intervals ( isi ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the two systems from their realizations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "the average isis @xmath29 , @xmath4 , will also characterize the timescales of two systems .",
    "* coherence . *",
    "generally , the width of the spectral peak can serve as an indication of the coherence of the oscillations : the narrower the peak is , the more coherent the oscillations are .",
    "however , as we will see below , the spectra of the observed oscillations have several distinguishable peaks with comparable heights placed at incommensurate frequencies ( i.e. , at frequencies that are not multiples of each other ) , and all peaks have different widths .",
    "it is not obvious the width of which peak should be taken as a measure of coherence , and thus the peak width does not represent an unambiguous criterion here and will not be used .",
    "another measure of coherence of oscillations is the correlation time @xmath30 .",
    "it is also not unambiguous because it can be introduced in several ways . here",
    "we will use the following method which seems the most universal : an autocorrelation function @xmath31[x(t)-\\langle x\\rangle]\\rangle$ ] will be calculated from the simulated realizations @xmath32 , and @xmath30 will be introduced as @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the variance of @xmath32 . the larger @xmath30 is , the more regular @xmath32 is .",
    "timescales and coherence can be introduced for each subsystem separately and then compared , or for some variable characterizing the state of the system as a whole .",
    "thus , we will estimate the statistical characteristics of the variables @xmath22 and @xmath36 , and of the global state variable @xmath37 .",
    "* synchronization . * finally , we need to characterize the synchronization between the two coupled oscillators .",
    "most generally , synchronization means an adjustment of timescales of oscillations in systems due to the interaction between them : if the timescales in the uncoupled systems are not rationally related , introduction of coupling can shift the timescales to make their ratio closer to a rational number @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 , where @xmath38 and @xmath40 are integers .",
    "this phenomenon is usually referred to as @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 frequency synchronization , and its suitable measure would be the closeness of the ratio of average isis @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 to the chosen rational number @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "note that frequency synchronization is associated with the time - averaged behavior of the coupled oscillators .",
    "a closely related , but not identical , phenomenon , which is usually called phase synchronization , is associated with instantaneous coordination between the interacting systems .",
    "it requires the definition of phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 for each oscillator and comparison between them",
    ". in our system the spiky nature of oscillations allows one to introduce the phase for each system as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the time at which we observe a spike in the respective system s realization .",
    "we define @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 phase synchronization to occur if the phase difference @xmath48 exhibits horizontal plateaus of sufficient duration . usually , if @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 synchronization takes place , @xmath49 demonstrates plateaus occasionally interrupted by @xmath50 jumps . on the plateaus",
    ", @xmath49 usually oscillates around some local average level .",
    "as time grows , @xmath49 drifts to plus or minus infinity .    in @xcite several measures to characterize phase synchronization",
    "were introduced . here",
    ", we choose to estimate the synchronization index @xmath51 @xmath52 can vary between @xmath17 ( no synchronization ) and @xmath53 ( perfect @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 phase synchronization ) . note that even if the ratio of average isis is close or even equal to some rational number @xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 , i.e. , frequency synchronization takes place , phase synchronization does not necessarily occur , and the synchronization index might be close to zero .",
    "all results in this paper are presented for @xmath6@xmath16@xmath54 , @xmath7@xmath16@xmath21 , @xmath8@xmath16@xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "mean frequency detuning will be determined by the choice of @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath57 , i.e. the systems are not identical , therefore at @xmath58 the mean frequencies of oscillations in two uncoupled ( @xmath59 ) systems will be different .",

    "we found that in our model both these synchronization mechanisms can be realised , depending on how well the timescales of interacting oscillators were separated from each other when uncoupled .",

    "namely , the initial increase of @xmath1 from zero leads to the growth of both @xmath41 and @xmath43 , the former growing faster than the latter .",

    ", both subsystems respond only slightly and comparably to the changes in @xmath1 .",
    "note that either for a moderately synchronized system , or for a system that is less synchronized , the feedback is able to make @xmath53@xmath39@xmath53 synchronization substantially stronger for a suitable choice of its parameters .",
    "however , it can not destroy the existing synchronization or weaken it as much as it can strengthen it .",
    "=    =    for the system that is very well synchronized from the beginning at @xmath18@xmath16@xmath84 and @xmath13@xmath16@xmath83 with @xmath74@xmath16@xmath95 , we reveal the isi ratio and synchronization index @xmath74 for a large range of @xmath79 and @xmath1 ( fig .  [ fig : fhnc_k_tau_d1_0.15_c_0.2 ] ) .",
    "already this picture shows that delayed feedback can either enhance or suppress synchronization .    for a more detailed picture of the phenomena induced by the feedback , a cut of this picture along @xmath79@xmath16@xmath53",
    "is given in fig .",

    "an immediate obvious observation is that , in contrast to the two previously considered cases of less synchronous subsystems , here the feedback can make synchronization perfect with @xmath74@xmath16@xmath53 , and can maintain it like this for a substantial range of @xmath1@xmath96@xmath97 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isi_tau_d1_0.15_c_0.2_k_1](a ) ) .",
    "the fact that the two subsystems are very synchronous from the beginning is also supported by very similar values of the correlation times of both systems realizations and of their sum at @xmath1@xmath16@xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isi_tau_d1_0.15_c_0.2_k_1](b ) ) .    as @xmath1",
    "is slighly increased from zero , as in the two previous examples , both @xmath41 and @xmath43 grow .",
    "but , as before , @xmath41 grows a little faster than @xmath43 .",
    "this can hardly be resolved in the plots , since @xmath41 and @xmath43 are very close and hardly distinguishable .",
    "however , the difference between them , and the disapperanace of this difference , is visible through the isi ratio ( fig .  [ fig : isi_tau_d1_0.15_c_0.2_k_1](a ) ) .    with this , @xmath30 and @xmath74",
    "slightly grow , too .",
    "all quantities considered achieve their maxima at @xmath1@xmath90@xmath67 . after that , as @xmath1 increases , the individual isis @xmath41 and @xmath43 grow simultaneously and remain equal , so that their ratio and synchronization index @xmath74 stay equal to @xmath53 with high accuracy in the range @xmath1@xmath96@xmath97 $ ] .",
    "however , surprisingly , while the isi ratio and @xmath74 are equal to @xmath53 , i.e. , the subsystems maintain the same level of perfect synchrony , all three correlation times decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "this means that while the two subsystems fire simultaneously , these firings occur less regularly .",
    "thus , the feedback here can introduce disorder into the system without destroying its perfect synchronization .    then",
    ", as @xmath1 continues to increase beyond the value of @xmath86 , as in the previous examples , the second subsystem demonstrates a noticeable maximum of its isi @xmath43 .",
    "although unlike in the two other examples , here @xmath41 continues to decrease , the isi ratio and @xmath74 exhibit a sharp minimum , and then grow again .    at @xmath1 increases beyond @xmath88 , the isi ratio and @xmath74 become less and less dependent on @xmath1 , asymptotically tending to some values that are only slighly lower than without the feedback . on the contrary , @xmath30 continues to change nonmonotonically with @xmath1 , never becoming less than without the feedback .",
    "since the system is in the state of a strong synchronization throughout the changes in @xmath1 , the changes in all three curves @xmath30 occur synchronously .",
    "thus , the feedback can make both local and global dynamics of the system more coherent , and at the same time weaken synchronization .",
    "we have considered a model describing two coupled excitable neurons , in the form of two mutually coupled non - identical excitable fitzhugh - nagumo systems , subject to independent sources of noise with different strengths . in order to assess the effect of time - delayed feedback control upon the coupled system",
    ", we have analyzed the following characteristics : the timescales of the individual systems quantified as mean interspike intervals ( isi ) ; the isi ratio as a measure of frequency synchronization ; the coherence quantified by the correlation time of the individual subsystems realizations and of their sum ; and the index of @xmath53@xmath39@xmath53 phase synchronization between the subsystems .",
    "the coupled system without control displays a @xmath53@xmath39@xmath53 synchronization tongue in the @xmath98 parameter plane , given by the noise strength @xmath18 in the first subsystem and the coupling strength @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , frequency and phase synchronization occurred in the same area of the parameter plane .",
    "two mechanisms for synchronization were identified : phase ( frequency ) locking , and suppression of natural dynamics , respectively .",
    "next , the first of the two interacting subsystems was subjected to the local delayed feedback with the aim to manipulate the global dynamics of the system of interacting oscillators .",
    "the feedback force was constructed as a difference between the current state of the system and its state some @xmath1 time units before , multiplied by a positive constant @xmath79 .",
    "the delayed feedback was applied to the system in three states of synchrony : moderately synchronized , weakly synchronized , and strongly synchronized . in all three cases ,",
    "@xmath53@xmath39@xmath53 synchronisation could be either improved or weakened , depending upon the choice of @xmath1 and @xmath79 .",
    "like the correlation times , the synchronisation index is modulated nonmonotonically as a function of the delay time @xmath1 , indicating that there is resonance - like behavior for certain values of @xmath1 .",
    "perfect synchronisation can only be achieved if the uncontrolled state is already sufficiently synchronized .",
    "the mechanism behind the reported action of the delayed feedback is as follows .",
    "as it was shown earlier @xcite , the feedback applied to a single excitable system is able to change the timescales and coherence of noise - induced oscillations . when the system subjected to the feedback is coupled to another system , the shift of the timescale of",
    "the former will lead to a proportional shift of the timescale of the latter .",
    "the exact magnitude of the shift in the second subsystem will depend on the closeness of the two subsystems to the state of synchronization .",
    "only if the two subsystems are sufficiently @xmath53@xmath39@xmath53 synchronized from the beginning , the shift in the second system can be expected to match the shift in the first system .",
    "interestingly , the above mechanism does not always work in the system considered .",
    "namely , for some ranges of time delay @xmath1 , the change in @xmath1 does not cause any noticeable change in the system to which the feedback is applied .",
    "however , it does change the properties of oscillations in the system that is coupled to it , albeit that does not experience the influence of the feedback directly .",
    "an important observation is that the delay - induced increase of coherence of the global dynamics is most frequently accompanied by the growth of the degree of synchronization .",
    "however , a high synchonization index does not always mean high coherence : delayed feedback can induce , or make stronger , the synchronization between the two subsystems , but the state of each subsystem , and their global dynamics , can become more disordered at the same time .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "it is remarkable that delayed feedback control can influence global characteristics of the two coupled neurons although the control is only applied locally to a subsystem .",
    "we were able to enhance or destroy the regularity of oscillations and the stochastic synchronization of the two neurons by choosing appropriate control parameters , in particular a suitable delay time .",
    "we consider these findings as important for the understanding of coupled nonlinear systems and see possible applications especially in neuroscience .",
    "in fact , experimental studies of two coupled neurons from the stomatogastric ganglion of a lobster @xcite , and from a leech @xcite have reported various degrees of synchrony of excitatory postsynaptic potentials . as stochastic sources of the spontaneous random firing of neurons , noise due to the conducting ion channels , synaptic noise , and noise resulting from the coupling to a large number of other neurons emitting signals , have been identified @xcite .",
    "also it was demonstrated experimentally @xcite that spatially and temporally coherent @xmath99 waves , mediated by network noise , may play an important role in generating correlated neural activity . by applying delayed feedback control to real neural systems one should be able to influence neural synchrony .",
    "first results of applying time - delayed neurofeedback from realtime meg signals to humans via visual stimulation in order to suppress the alpha rhythm , which is observed due to strongly synchronized neural populations in the visual cortex in the brain , look promising @xcite . further work should focus on more sophisticated models and on coupling more than two neurons .",
