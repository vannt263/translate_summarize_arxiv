    "the higgs - like boson has been discovered recently at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in a few decay channels .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath11 are particularly spectacular @xcite .",
    "before the discovery many of the higgs properties were strongly dependent on its mass . now knowing the higgs boson mass @xmath12 126 gev we can fix parameters for production and decay of the higgs boson , at least within the standard model .",
    "we slowly enter era of more detailed studies .",
    "in particular , it is very important to know what is the higgs boson spin and parity and if it is standard model object . also understanding the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions is particularly interesting . while the total cross section is well under control and was calculated in leading - order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and even next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) approximation @xcite the distribution in the higgs boson transverse momentum is more chalanging .",
    "this can be addressed e.g. in transverse momentum resummation approach ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was advocated recently that precise differential data for higgs boson in the two - photon final channel could be very useful to test and explore unintegrated gluon distribution functions ( ugdfs ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown very recently @xcite that the @xmath0-factorization formalism with commonly used ugdfs ( kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite and jung ccfm @xcite ) gives a reasonable description of recent atlas data obtained at @xmath13 8 tev @xcite .",
    "we perform similar calculation and , as will be seen in the following , draw rather different conclusions .    in the present study we present several differential distributions for the higgs boson and photons from the higgs boson decay at @xmath14 = 8 tev for various ugdfs from the literature , also the ones used in the context of low-@xmath15 physics ( kutak - stato @xcite and kutak - sapeta @xcite ) .",
    "we include both leading - order and next - to - leading order contributions .",
    "we shall critically discuss uncertainties and open problems in view of the recent atlas data .",
    "in the @xmath0-factorization approach the cross section for the higgs boson production can be written somewhat formally as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are so - called unintegrated ( or transverse - momentum - dependent ) gluon distributions and @xmath18 is @xmath3 ( off - shell ) cross section .",
    "the situation is illustrated diagramatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg_h ] .",
    "it is easy to show in the collinear approximation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that : @xmath19 after some manipulation the formula ( [ higgs_kt_factorization ] ) can be written conveniently as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath20 which can be also used to calculate rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of the higgs boson .    in the last equation : @xmath21 is transverse momentum of the higgs boson and @xmath22 is auxiliary variable which is used in the integration .",
    "furthermore : @xmath23 is the so - called higgs transverse mass and @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the factor @xmath26 is the jacobian of transformation from @xmath27 to @xmath28 variables .",
    "similar formalism was used in the past for production of gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "there gluon distributions have to be replaced by unintegrated quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "let us concentrate for a while on the matrix element for the @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the on - shell matrix element was used . in ref .",
    "@xcite the off - shell matrix element was used instead , however in the approximation of infinitly heavy top in the triangle - coupling of gluons to the higgs boson ( see also@xcite where the off - shell matrix element was discussed ) .",
    "then the effective @xmath1 coupling is relatively simple .",
    "the matrix element under discussion ( for on - shell higgs boson ) takes the simple form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the effect of finite - mass corrections was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of @xmath0-factorization and in @xcite in the context of higher - order collinear approximation corrections",
    ". then the corresponding matrix element is more complicated and can be written with the help of two form factors : @xmath31   \\ ; . \\label{better_me}\\ ] ] the form factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 have an integral representation .",
    "however , at not too big virtualities of gluons and higgs boson the following approximate formula for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 form factors can be used @xcite : @xmath34 where the expansion variables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 above are defined as : @xmath38      the matrix element for the higgs boson decay into photons with helicity @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42 the leading - order ( lo ) vertex function can be decomposed as the sum @xmath43 where the first term includes loops with intermediate @xmath44 and the second term triangle(s ) with top quarks .",
    "the dots represent contribution of triangles with bottom and charm quarks and with @xmath45 leptons , etc .",
    "the vertex function can be written as : @xmath46 in the standard model the @xmath47 constant is : @xmath48 where the arguments are : @xmath49 the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the simple form : @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 reads : @xmath54 for light fermions the function @xmath53 is slightly different @xcite .",
    "the two - photon decay width can be calculated as : @xmath55 the factor @xmath56 is due to identity of the final state photons . using eq.([decay_width ] ) with matrix element given by eq.([me_h_gamgam ] ) we get @xmath57 = 0.91 @xmath58 10@xmath59 which , when combined with the total decay width @xmath60 4 mev @xcite , gives branching fraction @xmath61 = 2.27 @xmath58 10@xmath62 , consistent with what is known from the literature ( see e.g. ref .",

    "this has consequences some distance from the resonance position where the cross section is however small . in principle , also @xmath74 in definition of the @xmath47 functions should be replaced by @xmath75 here .",
    "since we integrate over full phase space in @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 we have to include in addition identity factor @xmath56 , in full analogy to the calculation of the decay width into two photons .    how to remove the @xmath76 function in eq.([kt_2_to_2 ] ) in a convenient for calculation way is described in ref .",
    "the calculation of the cross section according to formula ( [ kt_2_to_2 ] ) with matrix element ( [ me_gg_h_gamgam ] ) is not easy as the light higgs boson discovered recently is a very narrow resonance .",

    "we have checked that the @xmath77 contribution dominates over the two other types of contributions .",

    "@xcite .",
    "calculation of the off - shell matrix element for the process under consideration is rather complicated in the most general case as it involves loops ( triangles and boxes ) .",
    "since the box diagrams with very heavy top quarks / antiquarks dominate at high energies we expect that the off - shell effects should be relatively small . in the present approach",

    "it is well known that in contrast to gauge boson ( @xmath44 and @xmath93 ) production for calculating inclusive cross section for the higgs boson production not only lo but also nlo and even nnlo corrections are pretty large .",
    "collinear nnlo contributions to the higgs boson production associated with dijet production was discussed e.g. in ref .",

    "the matrix element for the @xmath6 which can ( should ) be used to compare the collinear factorization result with the @xmath0-factorization approach result reads : @xmath94 where dependence on renormalization scale was made explicit .",
    "here the matrix element is evaluated as in ref .",
    "@xcite using high - energy approximations .",
    "it can be written somewhat schematically as : @xmath95 the matrix element is particularly simple in the limit : @xmath96 we have made explicit running of strong coupling constant in ( [ gg_ghg ] ) . in practical calculation",
    "it is reasonable to take @xmath97 and @xmath98 . at high energies @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the phase space integration is performed then with the @xmath6 matrix element squared and collinear gluon distribution functions ( gdfs ) , see for example next subsection . both integrated and differential cross sections can be then compared with those obtained within the @xmath0-factorization approach . especially inspiring is to understand the interrelation between the two approaches for larger jet / higgs transverse momenta @xmath101 , @xmath102 .    in the high - energy approach quark and antiquarks contributions",
    "can be easily included by replacing gluon distributions @xmath103 and @xmath104 by so - called effective parton distributions ( see e.g. ref .",

    "we shall evaluate and show the quark / antiquark components separately as they are not taken into account explicitly in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "now we wish to consider purely electroweak corrections that are known to give sizeable contribution to the higgs boson production .",
    "the second most important mechanism for the higgs boson production is the fusion of off - shell gauge bosons : @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "it is known that at the lhc energy the @xmath107 fusion constitutes about @xmath109 of the integrated inclusive cross section .",
    "if the weak boson fusion contribution was separated , the measurement of the @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) coupling would be very interesting test of the standard model .    in the present paper we are interested in differential distributions of higgs boson rather than in the integrated cross section .    for the gauge boson fusion",
    "the partonic subprocess is of the 2 @xmath80 3 type : @xmath112 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ww_fusion ] ) .        the corresponding proton - proton cross section can be written as @xmath113 the next - to - leading order corrections to the matrix element of the @xmath107 fusion are rather small @xcite .",

    "it is convenient to introduce the following new variables : @xmath117 which allow to eliminate the momentum - dependent @xmath118 in eq.([ww_fusion ] ) . instead of integrating over @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "we shall integrate over @xmath121 and @xmath122 . then using eq.([ww_fusion ] )",
    "we can write the inclusive spectrum of higgs boson as @xmath123 this is effectively a four - dimensional integral which can be calculated numerically .",
    "strong and electroweak corrections to the higgs boson production via vector - boson fusion at the lhc were calculated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "the corrections are relatively small and in the following analysis we shall show only leading - order results as a reference to the @xmath0-factorization result .      the @xmath108 fusion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zz_fusion ] ) can be calculated in an analogous way .",
    "the corresponding matrix element depends on the subprocess type ( set of quark , antiquark flavours ) .",
    "it can be written as @xcite : @xmath125 the flavour dependent coefficients read : @xmath126 the @xmath127 and @xmath128 are well known vector and axial - vector couplings of the @xmath93 boson to quarks / antiquarks .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of third component of the weak isospin , charge of quark / antiquark and sinus of the weinberg angle .",
    "the differential cross section is calculated in exactly the same way as for the @xmath107 fusion .      for completeness one could include also production of the higgs boson associated with gauge bosons @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath93 .",
    "these are formally lower - order ( 2 @xmath80 2 ) processes than the @xmath107 and @xmath108 fusion ( 2 @xmath80 3 ) processes considered above .",

    "the @xmath0-factorization results ( for several ugdfs used here ) are somewhat smaller .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , when calculating gluon longitudinal momentum fractions transverse momentum of the higgs boson is included which increases @xmath119 and @xmath120 and therefore lowers the cross section . secondly , many low-@xmath15 ugdf do not apply and/or are too small in the region of @xmath146 0.01 .",
    "quite different cross sections are obtained for different ugdfs .",
    "this shows that the ugdfs ( often fitted only to hera data ) are much more uncertain than the collinear gluon distribution functions ( gdf ) fitted to many sets of high - energy data .",
    "however , ugdfs have advantage that they can be used for correct ( exclusive ) kinematics including transverse momenta of initial gluons , which can not be addressed properly in collinear calculations . for comparison in the middle block",
    "we show contribution of @xmath144 processes calculated in the collinear - factorization approach for the jet transverse momenta bigger than 10 gev .",
    "the @xmath6 contribution is of similar size as that for the leading order @xmath3 @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "we think that the latter contribution is to large extent contained in the calculation with the kmr ugdf . however , the quark and antiquark initiated contributions which are also fairly large ( @xmath147 0.6 pb ) must be included in addition explicitly .    at the very bottom",
