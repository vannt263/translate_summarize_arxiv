( [ eq : coulomb - contact ] ) implies that there are no coulomb corrections to the effective range once the cut - off is removed , which is in agreement with the next - to - leading order calculation of kong and ravndal  @xcite , but disagrees with the next - to - next - to - leading order results of ref .",
    "it is also implied in our treatment that the pionless treatment of pp scattering can be made almost scale independent if , apart from the usual counterterms @xmath115 , a counterterm contribution proportional to @xmath53 is included in the computations , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "this observation is closely related with the results of ref .",

    "@xcite , where it is argued from the renormalization group behaviour of the counterterms in pds that it needs to be a strong and coulomb version of each counterterm ( to absorb the log - divergences ) , meaning that in the end it is impossible to relate strong and coulomb observables . on the contrary , the renormalization group analysis with cut - off regularization of birse and barford  @xcite seems to support the idea that the coulomb log - divergences can be absorbed in just one counterterm  .",

    "@xcite , further constraints on the short range ambiguities not considered in  @xcite can noticeably reduce the model dependence of strong parameters , in a better agreement with eft expectations .",

    "a complete formulation on the separation of strong and _ electromagnetic _ effects is only possible in the context of quantum field theory , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a modern discussion on the subject .",
    "we should nonetheless remember that cut - off regularization is a physical regularization , in the sense that the cut - off @xmath16 can be interpreted as a physical scale . from this point of view",
    ", the meaning of the log - divergence in the relationship between the strong and coulomb scattering length is straightforward : it represents the expected error of the strong scattering length in the pionless approximation , which scales as @xmath122 ( instead of @xmath123 , as in the other parameters ) , yielding a very large , about @xmath124 , expected relative error ( to be compared with the one for the effective range @xmath125 ) .",
    "one can also argue that the extra counterterm @xmath118 is not needed , as the inclusion of the higher order components of the potential will reduce the scale dependence .",

    "while a complete analysis should of course include vacuum polarization  @xcite , modifications to the coulomb potential  @xcite and even @xmath126 exchange  @xcite , the interesting issue is that one can obtain model independent strong phase shifts , provided that we employ a model independent strong pp potential @xmath3 and model independent coulomb phase shifts . here , we will do so with an eye put on the relevant scales in the problem , an aspect which our two - potential treatment can address in a rather clean way .    for the previous purpose",

    "we can obtain the strong pp phase shift and its error from the pwa @xmath129 and analyze the resulting cut - off dependence , which is an important issue , as for large coordinate space cut - offs the higher order pieces of the chiral potential are not resolved .",
    "it should be noted here that a complete model independent separation between strong and electromagnetic contributions is not always possible , specially if short distance electromagnetic effects are included .",
    "one example is the inclusion of nucleon form factor corrections to the magnetic moment interaction in the proton - proton pwa of ref .",
    "another example is proton finite size corrections to the coulomb potential .",
    "the formalism presented here clearly separates between _ what we define _ as the strong and electromagnetic _",
    "potential_. that does not necessarily mean that exact model independence has been achieved , specially if corrections like the ones mentioned above are added , or that strong and electromagnetic effects have been actually separated , specially as electromagnetic corrections to the proton mass or to the coupling constants have not been included .",
    "the specific procedure we will apply is analogous to the one followed in the pionless case , i.e. , we do not directly use the strong - coulomb two - potential formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2v - formula - coulomb ] ) , but rather perform a subtraction of the equivalent two - potential formula for the scattering lengths , and then check for cut - off independence of the results .",
