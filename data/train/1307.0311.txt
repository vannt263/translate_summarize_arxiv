    "entanglement in a bipartite quantum state , which is a signature of the quantum correlations between the two parts , has been explored from a wide range of viewpoints over last few years .",
    "apart from the main thrust area of quantum computation and information processing , where quantum entanglement is recognized as a resource@xcite , there is a growing interest in exploring entanglement properties of physical models exhibiting quantum critical - point phenomena@xcite , and conformal field theories@xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a subsystem , along with its various monotones , is a quantitative measure of the entanglement between the subsystems@xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy is not extensive as a function of the subsystem size , unlike physical observables . for systems with local interactions ,",
    "the correlations are expected to be short ranged ( implying a energy - mass gap ) in general , and long ranged in the vicinity of a critical point ( where the correlation length becomes very large , or the energy gap vanishingly small ) .",
    "this leads to the entanglement entropy obeying an area law in general , and near a critical point the entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the size .",
    "the study of entanglement in spin systems is dominated by one - dimensional models , with many different quantum spin models that can be exactly solved for the ground state and the excitation spectrum , viz .",

    ", kitaev studied a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice spin model , which is solvable by the jordan - wigner fermion technique , a rare example of exactly - solvable two - dimensional system@xcite .",
    "this model shows remarkable exotic features , such as excitations obeying non - abelian statistics , topological order and entanglement@xcite .",
    "there have been generalizations to other lattices , and to higher dimensions and higher spins@xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional variant of kitaev model with no magnetic field has been explored for the phase diagram and the non - abelian anyon excitations analytically@xcite , for the quenched dynamics@xcite .",
    "there are attempts to realize these spin models in systems of cold atoms@xcite and superconducting quantum circuits@xcite .    here",
    ", we will study the entanglement entropy of a simpler one - dimensional spin chain with kitaev - type interactions in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the one - dimensional model substantially simplifies the task of finding the ground state and further in obtaining the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , as we will see below , but still retaining many of the exotic features of the kitaev honeycomb model .",
    "we will employ a method of operator schmidt decomposition to compute the entanglement entropy .",
    "this method , which can be used in the context of other one - dimensional spin models , enables us to numerically compute the block entropy for spin chains with large number of lattice sites .",
    "we describe the spin chain model and the exact solution from jordan - wigner transformation in the next section .",
    "the ground state is written as a product state of @xmath9 modes , each mode consisting of four single - particle momentum states @xmath10 . in contrast , for the xy spin chain there are @xmath11 modes , each mode consisting of momentum @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in section iii",
    ", we show the schmidt decomposition of the ground state .",
    "we express the ground state using an exponentiated operator , and use the method of operator schmidt decomposition .",
    "this reduce the task of find the entanglement entropy to numerical diagonalization of a @xmath14 dimensional matrix . in the final section",
    "we discuss the results from numerical computation of the block entanglement entropy in the kitaev chain .",
    "we consider a finite one - dimensional closed spin chain with kitaev - type interactions .",

    "the nearest - neighbor spins interact through either x or y components of the spins on alternating pairs .",
    "the hamiltonian for a closed chain of n ( even ) spins is written as , @xmath16 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are interaction strengths on alternating bonds which favor x - x or y - y polarization locally , and @xmath2 is the strength of the transverse magnetic field which favors z polarization globally .",
    "thus , this model can not be mapped on to xy model with homogeneous couplings . as we will see below",
    ", this model has a macroscopic degeneracy in the ground state for all values of the interaction strengths , for @xmath3 .",
    "the degeneracy is completely lifted for a nonzero transverse magnetic field .",
    "the ground state degeneracy can be lifted by a staggered transverse field also .",
    "this implies a large correlation length , and long - ranged spin correlations for @xmath3 , and short - ranged correlations for a nonzero field .",
    "we will show later , that this does not translate directly into a logarithmically increasing block entropy for @xmath3 and all interaction strengths . working with @xmath17 basis for every spin , in a basis state the possible values for the total z - component of the spin are , @xmath18 . as the two interaction terms in the above hamiltonian are bilinear in x and y components of the spin operators , they mix only basis states within even ( or odd ) sector only .",
    "but still , this global symmetry can not account for a macroscopic degeneracy in the ground state for @xmath3 , for all interaction strengths .",
    "we examine the exact solution through jordan - wigner solution below .",
    "a more general spin chain has been investigated@xcite , in terms of unpaired majorana modes and their interaction with the background kink flux fields .",
    "we will use the fermion language , as the fermion operators can be more easily manipulated for calculating the block entropies .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be diagonalized , by following the usual steps of exact diagonalization of spin chains@xcite .",
    "all states can be written as direct products of different fermion modes in momentum space . in xy model",
    "there are @xmath19 uncoupled modes labeled by @xmath20 , a given mode mixing @xmath21 momentum values .",
    "we will see below that we get here @xmath9 uncoupled modes , with @xmath22 , mixing @xmath23 momentum values .",
    "we first go over to fermion variables from the spin operators that appear in the hamiltonian using the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite , given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 creates a fermion at site @xmath26 , and the number operator @xmath27 counts the fermions at the site .",
    "the @xmath28 basis states at a site are mapped to occupied and unoccupied state of the fermion , @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "basis states with even @xmath30 , the number of fermions , do not mix with odd @xmath30 states .",
    "now , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in either even or odd fermion number sector separately .",
    "we confine ourselves to even sector , as the ground state belongs to even fermion sector for @xmath14 even and periodic boundary conditions . now",
    "the bilinear terms in fermion operators can be uncoupled to a degree by going over the momentum space variables , the fermion operator is written as , @xmath31 where the sum is over all momentum values in the first brillouin zone .",
    "for the case of @xmath32 even , and periodic boundary condition , @xmath14 allowed values for @xmath33 are given by , @xmath34 the allowed range in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian now has the form in terms of the momentum - space operators , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we can see that the operators with momentum values @xmath39 are still coupled in this form .",
    "let us define a set of four operators labeled by a positive @xmath40 , as linear combinations of the fermion creation and annihilation operators , @xmath41 using these combinations , the hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 a is four - dimensional operator for a given mode . in the matrix form",

    "thus , the ground state energy is given by @xmath51 the ground state is non - degenerate , and it is given by a direct product over the lowest - energy states constructed from the vacuum state for each mode , we have latexmath:[\\[\\label{gs }    the normal - mode operators are given by , using the eigenvectors @xmath47 , @xmath53 where we have parametrized @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",

    "this even - odd symmetry in the lowest energy state exists for every mode .",
    "this translates to @xmath62 degenerate states for the ground state .",
    "half of these states have even number of fermions , and the other half of states belong to odd sector .",
    "the physical states should have even number of fermions , as we are working with even sector . to choose a physical state",
    ", we first choose any of the four states for @xmath63 modes , which gives us either an even or an odd state .",
    "if the state is even , then we choose either @xmath64 or @xmath65 for the last mode to make it a physical state , else , we choose one of the other two odd states to make the total state even in fermion number .",
    "thus the ground state degeneracy @xmath66 is given by @xmath67",
    "we are now interested in the entanglement distribution in the ground state of the spin chain , as a function of the coupling strengths and the magnetic field .",
    "the entanglement block entropy is expected to follow an area growth law in general , and exhibit a faster growth behavior as a function of the block size @xmath68 near a critical point . for one - dimensional system",
    ", this implies , a size - independent behavior away from critical regions ( where all correlations are short - ranged ) and a logarithmic behavior near a critical point@xcite .",
    "the ground state written using the normal - mode fermion operators , as given in eq.12 , has a slater - determinental wave function . with these wave functions ,",
    "the reduced density matrix for a block of spins , and the entanglement can be calculated using the correlation function matrix@xcite .",
    "we show a method here that can calculate the schmidt eigenvalues of the state directly , using a operator schmidt decomposition of the exponentiated operator that generates the ground state .",
    "let us briefly recall the schmidt decomposition of a many - qubit pure state .",
    "let us bipartition the spin chain , part @xmath69 contains the @xmath68 contiguous spins starting with the first spin , the rest of the spins , @xmath70 contiguous spins form the second part @xmath71 , let @xmath72 .",
    "any pure state of the multi - spin state is written as , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the wave function amplitude for the product basis state of the composite system .",
    "we can view this coefficient as an element of a matrix @xmath75 which has dimension @xmath76 .",
    "the above state can be written as sum over at most @xmath77 terms , in the schmidt - decomposed form , as    @xmath78    where the schmidt numbers @xmath79 are the eigenvalues of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes the transpose of the matrix .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath82 , calculated by a partial trace over @xmath71 states , has the above basis states as the eigenstates , and the schmidt numbers as the eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the entropy of the block @xmath69 , which is a measure of the entanglement between the two parts , is given by @xmath83    -12 cm -3.5 cm   of a block of @xmath68 contiguous spins is plotted as a function of the size for different set of values for the interaction strengths and the transverse magnetic field .",
    "( b ) the entropy for @xmath84 , for @xmath85 , exhibits an even - odd oscillatory variation .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=831,height=1133 ] -11 cm    now , the calculation of the eigenvalues @xmath79 for the ground state ( given in eq.[gs ] ) can still be a daunting task , as this entails construction of the reduced density matrix which is @xmath77 dimensional .",
    "we have the ground state for all values of interaction strengths written in terms of noninteracting fermion modes that are complicated linear combinations of the momentum space fermion variables defined in eq.3 .",
    "we will rewrite the state in a more transparent form below , so that the ground state can be brought to a schmidt - decomposed form .",
    "after unscrambling the operators given in eq.6 , we can express the ground state as , modulo a normalization constant , @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the operator product can be exponentiated , and after a further manipulation we can write the unnormalized ground state as @xmath88 where the operator in the exponent is given by @xmath89 we manipulate from this form of the state in the next section , to bring it to a schmidt decomposed form to calculate the block entanglement entropy .",
    "we employ a method of schmidt decomposing the operator @xmath90 itself , which is tantamount to calculating the eigenvalues of a @xmath91dimensional matrix .",
    "let us express the operator in real space basis as , @xmath92 where the coefficient @xmath93 is the fourier transform of the coefficients in eq.17 . in terms of the coefficients @xmath94 given by , @xmath95 we have @xmath96 + i",
    "\\beta_2(l - m ) [ ( -1)^{l+m } -1]$ ] .",
    "now , the exponentiated operator is written in real space .",
    "we can now partition the operator into three parts as , @xmath97 where the the first ( second ) term involves operators from part @xmath98 only .",
    "the last entangling term involves one fermion operator each from the two parts .",
    "all these three terms commute with each other .",
    "it is easy to see that the exponentiated operator @xmath99 generates a product of local transformations on the two parts ; it will not generate any entanglement .",
    "thus , we may drop the operators that act only on part a ( b ) only .",
    "that is , the ground state @xmath100 , given in eq.19 , and the state given by @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , for @xmath104 .",
    "we can write the operator appearing above as , @xmath105 where the coefficient is given by , @xmath106~ { \\rm re}~ \\beta_1(l - m - l)~\\nonumber\\\\ -~ 2    [ ( -1)^{l+m+l } -1]~ { \\rm im}~ \\beta_2(l - m - l).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we can employ an operator schmidt decomposition , in analogy with the state decomposition of writing the state as in eq.16 from eq.15 , we have @xmath107 where the operator schmidt numbers @xmath108 are eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath109 , and the new operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 are linear combinations of the original site basis operators .",
    "now , the normalized equivalent ground state is a direct product , given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the above has the schmidt decomposed form ( as in eq.16 ) , with @xmath77 terms in the expansion , the amplitude for each term is a product of @xmath68 factors .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath115 are labeled by numbers @xmath116 ( equal to 0 or 1 corresponding to either @xmath117 or @xmath118 appearing in each term of the expansion ) , we have @xmath119 the entropy of @xmath115 , viz .",
    "the block entanglement @xmath120 , is straightforward to evaluate , and we get , @xmath121 where the shanon binary entropy function is given by @xmath122 .",
    "this completes the method of expressing the entanglement entropy in terms of operator schmidt numbers , which gives an efficient method for numerical computation of the block entanglement .",
    "it can be easily employed for other spin chain models that are solvable by jordan - wigner fermionization , where the ground state is amenable to exponentiation , as in eq.[expo ] . however , the method is not applicable for the bethe - ansatz state of the heisenberg - xy spin chain , as it is not clear how to exponentiate it .",
    "we expect the method to work for kitaev honeycomb lattice , and other higher - dimensional systems , as long as the ground state is expressed as a direct product over modes , and exponentiation can be done , as in eq.[expo ] . some well - known states of the interacting electron systems , like the bcs state of the superconductors , have a similar structure .",
    "this method reduces the numerical effort substantially in the study of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for large lattices .",
    "it will be interesting to employ this method to study the entanglement spectrum , and the phase diagram of the electron / spin models from the entanglement perspective .",
    "-12 cm -3.5 cm   of a block of @xmath123 contiguous spins , for a closed chain with @xmath85 spins , as a function of ( a ) the magnetic field ( b ) the interaction strength.,title=\"fig:\",width=793,height=1133 ] -11.5 cm -0.75 cm",
    "we now turn to the block entanglement entropy for the ground state of our model as a function of the interaction strengths , the transverse field and the block size .",
    "we make a bipartition of the lattice of @xmath14 sites in to two blocks of size @xmath68 and @xmath124 .",
    "though the parent state is pure of the composite system , the block reduced density matrix may not represent a pure state , thus it carries an entropy .",
    "the amount of quantum correlations present in the state is quantified by the bipartite von neumann entropy . since the composite state is a pure state , it suffices to study the block entropy @xmath120 as a function of the size @xmath68 for @xmath125 , for all values of the interaction strengths and the transverse magnetic field .",
    "the scaling of the entropy with the block size @xmath68 is related to the quantum correlations of the system , viz .",
    "the entropy is expected to follow the area law@xcite when the correlations are short ranged or the system is away from criticality .",
    "for the one - dimensional system , this implies that the entropy is independent of the size ( since the block has a surface with just two sites irrespective of the size ) , as we will see below this is the case for all values of the interaction strengths when a nonzero field is present .",
    "the deviation from the area law is expected , with a logarithmically increasing entropy as a function of the block size , in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "since the correlations tend to be long ranged near a quantum critical point , they should reflect in behavior of the entropy as well .",
    "it has been shown using conformal field theories , which are related to the continuum limit of the gapless spin systems near a critical point , the coefficient of the logarithmic correction of the entropy is related to the central charge of the system .",
    "we will see below that the spin chain we are investigating shows a critical behavior for @xmath126 , and for all other values it is gapped .",
    "we now turn to the numerical computation of the block entropy using the method we developed in the previous section .",
    "the numerical task is to get the operator schmidt numbers of eq.27 , from the diagonalization of a @xmath68-dimensional matrix @xmath127 ( see eq.25 ) .",
    "this means we can consider spin chains with a large number of sites . to this end , we have numerically computed the operator schmidt numbers from eq.25 , in the various parameter regimes , for a large spin chain with @xmath128 spins .",
    "fig.1a shows the block entanglement entropy as a function of the block size @xmath68 for different values of the interaction strengths and the magnetic field .",
    "we have shown here the block entropy for the case of even @xmath68 only .",
    "this is because there is even - odd oscillatory behavior of the entropy with the size . as we can see from fig.1a , at the macroscopic degeneracy point",
    ", for @xmath129 , the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic behavior for @xmath72 , which is an expected behavior for a system in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "the entropy is given by @xmath130 the coefficient , known as the central charge , seems to fit @xmath131 .",
    "this value of the central charge is different from other spin models@xcite , for example @xmath132 for the heisenberg spin chain .",
    "we can take that the spin correlations are long - ranged at this degeneracy critical point , in analogy with the conformal field theory result for other spin models with known critical - point behavior of the correlation functions .    as we can see from fig.1a , for @xmath4",
    "the block entropy is independent of the block size , thus obeying the area law , implying the system is away from the critical region .",
    "this is expected as the nonzero transverse field lifts the macroscopic degeneracy , shown in eq.14 , we expect the system to be away from criticality , presumably with short - ranged correlations . however , we see from fig.1a that the entropy obeys the area law even for @xmath3 but the interaction strengths are not equal , @xmath7 . here",
    ", the ground state still has a macroscopic degeneracy , just as for equal interaction strengths . in this case",
    "we seem to have conflicting indications , the entanglement entropy obeying the area law indicates the system is away from a critical point with short - ranged correlations , the gapless excitation spectrum accompanying a macroscopic degeneracy indicates the system is in the vicinity of a critical point accompanied by long - ranged correlations .",
    "similar conflicting features have been seen in the two - dimensional kitaev model by baskaran , sen and shankar@xcite , where a parameter regime exists in which the ground state has gapless excitations along with short - range correlation functions .",
    "the present situation may be similar , and we conjecture that off - diagonal correlation functions may be short ranged in this model . the diagonal correlations may be long ranged due to a spin polarization that can result due to the unequal interaction strengths .",
    "the block entropy will depend on the diagonal and off - diagonal correlations functions and their range , analogously of the other measures of the entanglement like concurrence@xcite .",
    "the block entanglement , unlike the concurrence measure , will depend on various multi - spin correlation functions , making the situation more complicated .",
    "since our method deals directly with the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix only , a detailed study of multi - spin correlations can not be addressed here .    in the regime with unequal interaction strengths and zero magnetic field ,",
    "the entanglement entropy exhibits an even - odd non - monotonic behavior as a function of the size .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the block entanglement is highlighted in fig.1b for a smaller chain with @xmath85 spins .",
    "this even - odd effect is persistent for very large sizes also , as the block entanglement itself becomes size independent in this regime .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior may be related to the fact that we have an inhomogeneous chain , and for odd @xmath68 , the block will have unequal number of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bonds .",
    "similar behavior has been seen in spin - one chains with bi - quadratic interactions , in spin chains with boundaries , in su(n ) hubbard chains with further neighbor hopping@xcite .",
    "we can also study the entropy as a function of the interaction strengths and the magnetic field separately , to track the critical - point behavior and its signature .",
    "we fix the block size to be @xmath133 , so the entropy takes its maximum value . in fig.2a",
    ", we have plotted the block entropy of the largest block , for @xmath85 , @xmath133 , as a function of @xmath134 for the case of @xmath135 and @xmath136 . as a function of the magnetic field",
    ", the block entropy displays a peak structure at @xmath3 , for @xmath137 , tracking the quantum critical behavior at @xmath3 . but for the case of unequal strengths , @xmath136 , the peak structure is quite diminished , apart from shifting from @xmath3 , to a slightly negative value .",
    "away from the peak , the entropy itself becomes small for large magnetic field .",
    "the spins are expected to be polarized predominantly along the field direction , thus decreasing the entropy .",
    "we have shown in fig.2b the behavior of the block entropy as a function of @xmath138 , for both @xmath3 and @xmath139 . here also , the block entropy tracks the critical behavior with a sharp peak near @xmath137 for the case of @xmath3 . for large @xmath1 , for a fixed @xmath0 and a small field ,",
    "the spins are polarized along @xmath140 direction , thus decreasing the entropy . in both the cases of a nonzero magnetic field and/or unequal interaction strengths ,",
    "the system is away from critical point , as we discussed earlier in the context of the size dependence of the block entanglement .",
    "the peak structure in this case can not really be associated to the tracking of a critical point , as a true critical behavior obtains only for @xmath141 .",
    "the diminished peak may signify a smear or rounding off in the critical behavior , and thus can be useful in locating a critical point in numerical computations by tuning the parameter regime . in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the spin chain with kitaev - type interactions is exactly solved through jordan - wigner fermionization .",
    "we have employed a method that reduces the task of finding @xmath77 eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of a block of @xmath68 spins , to finding the eigenvalues of a @xmath91dimensional matrix . using this method ,",
    "we have numerically computed block entropies for the spin chains with a large number of spins .",
    "the block entropy obeys the area law for all interaction strengths for a nonzero transverse magnetic field , implying the system is gapped and away from a critical point .",
    "the block entropy shows a logarithmic increase with the block size only at the degeneracy point @xmath141 , though there is a macroscopic degeneracy for @xmath7 .",
