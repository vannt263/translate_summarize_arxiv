    "two different approaches to the critical point @xmath1 are taken by the two - component percolation problem and the more - familiar conductor / insulator percolation problem .",

    "the wdm was developed to calculate effective transport coefficients ( e.g. , conductivity ) of composite materials and systems @xcite .",
    "this method exploits the isomorphism between the transport equations and the diffusion equation for a collection of non - interacting walkers ( hence the name ) .",
    "the phase domains in a composite correspond to distinct populations of walkers , where the walker density of a population is given by the value of the transport coefficient of the corresponding phase domain .",
    "the principle of detailed balance ensures that the population densities are maintained , and provides the following rule for walker diffusion over a digitized ( pixelated ) composite : a walker at site ( or pixel ) @xmath17 attempts a move to a randomly chosen adjacent site @xmath18 during the time interval @xmath19 , where @xmath2 is the euclidean dimension of the space ; this move is successful with probability @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the transport coefficients for the phases comprising sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "( in practice , the unsuccessful moves inherent in this rule are eliminated by use of the variable residence time algorithm @xcite . )",

    "@xmath28 , the walker diffusion is anomalous rather than gaussian due to the heterogeneity of the composite at length scales less than @xmath0 .",
    "there is , however , an additional characteristic length @xmath29 below which the composite is effectively homogeneous @xcite ; this may correspond , for example , to the average phase domain size .",
    "a walker displacement of @xmath0 requiring a travel time @xmath30 is then comprised of @xmath31 segments of length @xmath32 , each requiring a travel time of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the walker diffusion coefficient calculated from displacements @xmath35 .",

    "from the point of view of the wdm , the two - component percolation problem differs from the conductor / insulator percolation problem mainly by the fact that walkers are never `` stranded '' on finite clusters of conductor sites ( until precisely @xmath39 ) .",

    "finite clusters are identified by the fact that _ all _ conductor sites comprising the cluster have been visited by time @xmath149 ( so the cluster is completely surrounded by insulator sites ) .",
    "an `` infinite '' ( or percolating ) cluster includes at least one conductor site on the boundary that was `` created '' by the walker ( in the manner described above ) but never actually visited in time @xmath149 .    in general ,",

    "most calculations of interest require arguably correct ( as well as accurate ) values for the average walker displacement - squared @xmath155 .",
    "in particular it is important that a sufficient number of independent walks ( i.e. , walks over a sufficient number of distinct sections of a percolating system ) be taken in order that a mean value for @xmath155 with reasonably narrow bounds is obtained .",

    "as more walks are taken ( i.e. , as @xmath153 increases ) , the average value @xmath155 fluctuates less and flattens out .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows five sets of points pertaining to walker diffusion on the incipient cluster in 3d .",
    "again , sets of size @xmath151 appear to be sufficient to obtain a defensible value for @xmath155 for use in calculations .",

    "data from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( walk time @xmath173 ) and [ fig3 ] ( @xmath174 ) are used ( together with additional sets of size @xmath171 ) in the calculations of @xmath94 below .      for percolating systems of size @xmath175 , the equivalent of eq .",

    "the latter value reflects the fact that a walker adjacent to the cluster boundary at one length scale is not adjacent at smaller length scales .",

    "the function @xmath238 where the ratio @xmath239 is obtained in the course of generating the large number of walks of time @xmath82 .",
    "this ratio appears in the conductor / superconductor percolation problem . in particular",
    ", the effective conductivity @xmath6 of this system diverges as @xmath241 where the exponent @xmath115 is the walker path dimension at @xmath85 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath242 can be obtained via the relation    @xmath243    it was noted above that @xmath116 indicates the walks needed for this calculation are superdiffusive , meaning some individual moves are very large , in the manner of lvy flights .",
    "this occurs because a walker , upon entering a cluster of superconductor sites , is immediately expelled from a randomly chosen periphery site of that same cluster ( randomly chosen because the walker is immediately equilibrated within the cluster ) .",
    "thus a walk of time @xmath149 consists of diffusion through the conductor phase , punctuated by long jumps across superconductor clusters during which no time passes .",
    "this ensures that walker populations ( reflecting the distribution of conductor and superconductor sites ) throughout the system are maintained .",
    "for the two - component system , the effective conductivity @xmath244 where @xmath245 , and @xmath81 is the walker diffusion coefficient obtained for walk times @xmath82 .",
    "while every system site is accessible to a walker ( in contrast to the conductor / insulator system ) , it is convenient to use the same `` created cluster '' code .",
    "thus the walker is placed on a site that is randomly chosen to be of the @xmath3 sort ( with probability @xmath1 ) or of the @xmath4 sort ( with probability @xmath246 ) .",
    "then each neighboring site is defined to be of the @xmath3 sort ( with probability @xmath1 ) or of the @xmath4 sort ( with probability @xmath246 ) .",
    "then the walker moves to one of those sites over a time @xmath148 as dictated by the variable residence time algorithm .",
    "and so on .    the 3d results for ratios @xmath247 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "the intent of this research was to clarify the relationship between the two - component percolation problem and the familiar conductor / insulator percolation problem .",
    "the walker diffusion method provided a new conceptual , analytical , and numerical approach to this task .",
    "an important achievement is the introduction of a new critical exponent @xmath43 that connects the two types of percolating systems .",
    "this is the fractal dimension of the walker path in the two - component system at the endpoint @xmath39 .",
    "it is also the limit of the walker path dimension @xmath38 in the conductor / insulator system when all conductor clusters are connected by an extremely low conductivity `` background '' ( replacing the insulator phase ) , attained at @xmath85 and background conductivity reduced to zero .",
    "the connection made apparent by @xmath43 ( and the equivalent exponent @xmath118 for the superconducting systems ) leads to eq .",
    "( [ e26 ] ) , relating the conductivity exponent @xmath14 and superconductivity exponent @xmath105 , and the corresponding exponents @xmath44 and @xmath248 .    the value @xmath43 is best calculated from the exponent relation @xmath96 derived in sec .",
    "use of the calculated value for @xmath249 and the standard value for @xmath250 produce @xmath251 for 2d systems .",
    "alternatively , @xmath43 may be obtained via the relation @xmath252 describing walks over the conductor / insulator system at @xmath85 , where walkers on the finite clusters ( in addition to those on the incipient cluster ) are included in the calculation . those trapped walkers",
    "diffuse according to the variable residence time algorithm during the walk time @xmath149 , and so contribute to the average displacement - squared @xmath155 ( hence @xmath253 ) .",
    "additionally , very good values for the critical exponent @xmath94 in two and three dimensions are obtained , which enable calculation of accurate values for the conductivity exponents @xmath249 and @xmath131 .",
    "wdm calculations also support the conjectured value @xmath77 , which motivates a proposed set of equations connecting conductivity exponents across dimensions ."
