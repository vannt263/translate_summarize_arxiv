    "one of the fundamental problems in the search for exoplanets via transits is the relatively small fraction of systems exhibiting periodic transits that are found to be caused by exoplanets after follow - up observations reveal the nature of the orbiting body .",
    "the process of verification consumes a great deal of telescope time on top - class instruments .",
    "this process would be made more efficient by the development of a method that could identify the best and worst candidates from the collection of blends , binaries and exoplanets that comprise a typical candidate set from transit searches .",
    "@xcite touched on this possibility while exploring the feasibility of estimating stellar parameters from the photometric properties of an observed transit . using a fully analytical derivation",
    ", they showed that four parameters ( depth , period , full transit duration , and duration minus ingress and egress times ) could be used to calculate physical parameters such as mean stellar density and radius ratio for the system , assuming that the transiting body is an exoplanet and that the orbit is circular .",
    "non - planetary transiting bodies will produce somewhat aphysical parameters , particularly in the radius of the transiting body .",
    "a typical blend , for example , would produce a radius for the transiting body that would be 20%-50% larger than that expected for a close - in giant planet .",
    "unfortunately , this technique requires extremely precise photometry .",
    "seager & malln - ornelas quote a need for 5 millimag precision with 5 minute sampling for two transits ( provided these two transits define the true period ) for short - period giant planets .",
    "current transit search campaigns do not produce data of this quality , which limits the applicability of this technique .",
    "however , as we show , it is still possible to use the photometric properties of transits derived from less precise data to identify the best exoplanet candidates from a large sample . by using a set of reasonable approximations",
    ", we derive a numerical tool ( called the exoplanet diagnostic ) that indicates how `` planet - like '' a particular event is using only the transit period , duration and depth .",
    "this diagnostic makes it possible to exclude many of the candidates from transit searches without the need for follow - up observations , including many of those caused by blends .    in section 2",
    ", we derive the exoplanet diagnostic and discuss the impact of orbital eccentricity . in section 3 , the results of our analysis of existing transit searches and of the effectiveness of the diagnostic in distinguishing modeled blends is presented",
    "the duration , @xmath1 , of a transit depends on many parameters : the radii and masses of the two transiting objects , semi - major axis , orbital inclination , eccentricity , viewing orientation and period .",
    "a completely general equation describing the duration of the transit can be derived from these variables .",
    "we begin with the derivation of transit duration given by @xcite ,    @xmath2    in which @xmath3 is the eccentric angle between the first and last contacts of the transit , @xmath4 is the angular velocity of the planet at the time of the transit , @xmath5 is the separation between the planet and the parent star at the time of transit , and @xmath6 is the orbital velocity at this time . assuming that @xmath5 does not change appreciably during transit , and that @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , @xmath3 can be written as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the radii of the transiting bodies and @xmath11 is the orbital inclination . invoking conservation of angular moment @xmath12 ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the total mass of the system , @xmath15 is the reduced mass , @xmath16 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , and @xmath17 is the orbit eccentricity . putting these pieces together yields :    @xmath18    where we have absorbed the geometrical effects of the projected inclination into @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 at most unity ( in the case of an @xmath20 central transit ) and increasingly less than unity for increasing degrees of misalignment ( see fig .  2 ) . in order to eliminate @xmath16 and @xmath5",
    ", we invoke kepler s third law ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the period of the orbit . then , recalling the equation for an ellipse    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the eccentric angle at transit center of the system , relative to the semi - major axis of the orbit ( @xmath24 depends only on viewing geometry ; see fig .",
    "1a ) , we can write the final equation for the transit duration as    @xmath25",
    "this equation is general ; in the case of exoplanets , @xmath26 , the mass of the parent star .      as there are a large number of unknowns , we first examine the simplest case of circular ( @xmath27 ) orbits .",
    "this is a relevant case since transit searches are most sensitive to `` hot jupiters '' ( that is , jovian - mass planets with @xmath28 au ) , all of which discovered thus far have very low eccentricities . for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "7 reduces to    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the radius of the exoplanet and @xmath33 is the radius of the parent star .",
    "this contains four unknowns that can not be observed directly : @xmath19 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , as we show below , it is possible to replace all but one of these with observable quantities .    through extensive modeling of planetary transits using a standard zams and limb darkening from from @xcite for many different exoplanet - star size ratios and projected inclinations , we find that the fractional depth @xmath35 of a central exoplanetary transit in the @xmath36 passband can be approximated as    @xmath37    off - center transits will have only slightly lower constants of proportionality unless they are grazing , which is an unlikely , but still possible , scenario .",
    "the mass - radius relationship for the lower main sequence @xcite proposes :    @xmath38    with these three equations , we create a diagnostic @xmath0 , namely the ratio of the theoretical duration @xmath1 ( derived above ) and the observed duration , @xmath39 ( obtained from photometric observations ) .",
    "there are still unknowns : the factor @xmath19 , known to be constrained to lie between 0 and 1 , and one of @xmath33 or @xmath32 .",
    "the latter duality leads to two different forms of the exoplanet diagnostic , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , each of which is useful in different circumstances .",
    "radii of stars that are thought to have a reasonable chance of harboring an exoplanet , namely main sequence spectral types f through late k , can vary by a factor of three or so , while the typical planetary radius that can produce a detectable transit from ground varies by about a factor of two .",
    "therefore , ground - based transit searches would be better served by a diagnostic ( @xmath40 ) that takes the unknown @xmath32 to be constant , while satellite missions , which are sensitive to a much wider range of @xmath32 , would be better served using a diagnostic ( @xmath42 ) that assumed @xmath33 was constant .",
    "we stress , however , that for any primaries for which the radius can be estimated ( from spectral classification , for example ) , @xmath42 should be used .",
    "these two exoplanet diagnostics , easily derivable from the above equations , are :    @xmath43   % % \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\left(\\frac{2\\pi gm\\odot}{\\tau}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3 } }   % % r_{\\rm p}^{\\frac{-7}{12}}r_\\odot^{\\frac{-5}{12}}\\left(\\frac{1.3}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{5}{24 } }   = \\frac{d_{\\rm obs}}{2z \\left(1+\\sqrt{1.3/d}\\right ) }   \\left(\\frac{2\\pi gm\\odot}{\\tau}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3 } }   r_{\\rm p}^{-\\frac{7}{12}}r_\\odot^{-\\frac{5}{12}}\\left(\\frac{1.3}{d}\\right)^{\\frac{5}{24}}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath44    note that @xmath40 is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath42 is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "the one remaining unknown left in these equations , @xmath19 , will not critically affect the viability of these diagnostics .",
    "in what follows , we take @xmath45 and describe the consequences of this assumption .",
    "looking at eqs . 4 and 7 , one would expect the typical binary transit to last longer than the typical exoplanet transit , as the radius of a transiting star would far exceed that of a transiting planet , unless it was an extreme grazing eclipse .",
    "the @xmath46 for an exoplanetary transit becomes @xmath47 for a stellar eclipsing binary  a large increase in this term .",
    "a more in - depth examination of these diagnostics gives greater insight into the situation .",
    "@xmath40 scales as    @xmath48    while @xmath42 scales as    @xmath49    decreasing the inclination of the orbit not only reduces the measured duration , @xmath39 , but also reduces the transit depth , @xmath35 . both factors act to reduce @xmath40 , while they counteract each other for @xmath42 .",
    "the latter has a much stronger dependence on @xmath39 than @xmath35 for the shallow events that are of interest , so decreasing @xmath19 also decreases @xmath42 .",
    "following this line of reasoning , the diagnostics will therefore be a maximum for central transits ( with @xmath50 ) and less for more grazing transits .",
    "thus , true exoplanetary events would have a diagnostic less than or equal to one , while stellar events ( blends or grazing binaries ) would often , but not always , have diagnostics greater than one .",
    "some grazing stellar binaries and blended eclipsing binaries will have similar diagnostics to exoplanets , which will lead to some stellar contamination in the reduced set of candidates even after the diagnostic has been applied .",
    "some grazing binaries can be identified via a clearly v - shaped transit @xcite , the presence of ellipsoidal variations @xcite , or by virtue of the existence of a detectable secondary transit that has a different depth than that of the primary transit .",
    "also , binary systems in which both stars are nearly identical will have a photometric period that is one - half the actual period , as it will have two identical transits per orbit .",
    "because of this , their diagnostics are increased by a factor of @xmath51 , helping to push them out of the regime populated by exoplanetary events .",
    "additionally , a large percentage of systems involving transits of giant stars could in theory be identified as non - planetary , as their large radii lead to very long transit durations .",
    "the exoplanet diagnostic should also be useful in separating most blends from exoplanetary transits .",
    "blended eclipsing binaries would have a high @xmath47 compared to exoplanets and the dilution of their transits to a shallower depth by a third component means that their transits would generally be more central than a grazing binary for a given transit depth .",
    "they would thus have a longer duration ( and a higher exoplanet diagnostic ) relative to other events with a similar transit depth , whether they be grazing binaries or exoplanets .",
    "this is potentially very useful for missions such as kepler , which will likely identify large numbers of objects that exhibit periodic transits of a variety of depths  many of which will be blends .",
    "the shallowest events are both the most interesting and the most difficult to confirm via follow - up observations ; any technique that can eliminate some of these without follow - up will save significant astronomical resources .",
    "a good fraction of the exoplanets that have been discovered to date have nearly circular orbits .",
    "in fact , the average eccentricity for all known exoplanets with periods less than about 60 days is approximately 0.1 .",
    "however , the majority has periods longer than 60 days , where the average eccentricity rises sharply to 0.3 @xcite .",
    "we are thus led to consider the effect of eccentricity on the diagnostic . as can be seen from eq .",
    "7 , the diagnostic depends on the eccentricity in the following fashion :    @xmath52    the dependence on the viewing angle @xmath24 creates a distribution in the possible diagnostics for a given period and eccentricity given by :    @xmath53    however , the probability that a transit will be observed to occur is inversely proportional to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this means that transits are more likely to occur when @xmath5 is smaller , the orbital velocities are correspondingly higher , and thus transit durations are correspondingly shorter .",
    "this selection effect skews the spread in observed @xmath0 toward lower diagnostics ( see fig .",
    "3 ) :    @xmath54    where we have used eq .  15 and eq .  6 to describe @xmath5 in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the average @xmath0 that can be expected is then :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as defined by eq .  15 .",
    "thus , we can expect the average observed @xmath0 to decrease with increasing eccentricity .",
    "unfortunately , the same is also true for binary stars , which increases the chance of a non - planetary system producing a planet - like diagnostic .",
    "we now illustrate the effectiveness of the diagnostic @xmath0 in separating exoplanetary - like transit candidates from a large fraction of the pretenders that may be caused by eclipsing binary stars , which are either grazing or heavily blended .",
    "the transit candidates discovered by the ogle group @xcite provide an excellent opportunity to test the performance of the exoplanet diagnostic .",
    "orbital periods , transit durations and depths for 137 candidates are available , along with a short list of confirmed exoplanets in the sample . the results of the application of the exoplanet diagnostic ( @xmath40 ) to the ogle candidates are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( and the data used to create it are found in table 1).we have assumed a planetary radius of @xmath58 , as representative of the largest hot jupiters found . for comparison , modeled central transits of jupiter and saturn and the actual transit data of hd209458 @xcite and tres-1 @xcite are included .    of those ogle candidates that have been followed up with further observations ( ogle - tr-59 and lower ) , ogle - tr-56 @xcite and",
    "ogle - tr-10 @xcite are the only two confirmed exoplanets in this sample .",
    "indeed , ogle - tr-10 was confirmed after we identified it as interesting from our diagnostic analysis .",
    "they have the lowest and fifth lowest exoplanet diagnostics , respectively .",
    "the exoplanets that have been identified in the later sample ( ogle - tr-111 @xcite , ogle - tr-113 and ogle - tr-132 @xcite ) , which has not been studied completely ( ogle - tr-60 and higher ) , are also among those with the lowest diagnostics .",
    "the modeled jupiter and saturn also produce low diagnostics , as do hd209458 @xcite and tres-1 @xcite .",
    "this evidence makes a strong argument that our diagnostic can effectively identify candidates that are more likely to be exoplanets . as such",
    ", it seems likely that other exoplanets will be discovered in this second set of ogle candidates .",
    "additionally , our analysis suggests that several ogle candidates warrant ( see table 1 ) a more thorough investigation , while other disputed events , such as ogle - tr-33 , do not .",
    "we note , in fact , that the most recent research suggests that ogle - tr-33 is in fact a blend @xcite .",
    "testing the response of the exoplanet diagnostic to blended eclipsing binary systems is not as simple . in order to get an accurate impression of the events that could be observed to mimic exoplanetary transits , many different types of binary systems must be modeled at a variety of projected inclinations .",
    "the types of exoplanets that could be observed must also be modeled .",
    "both of these tasks can be readily performed using the expectations from a standard zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and limb darkening laws  in this case , we used those from @xcite .",
    "the blends can then be constructed using the modeled binary star transits and the equations for blends described by @xcite .",
    "using @xmath42 , the diagnostics of modeled blends can be compared to those of modeled exoplanets .",
    "other methods may be used to eliminate blends .",
    "for example , blends will have v - shaped transits or secondary transits that would be readily identifiable in the light curves . as with grazing binaries , blends can also have primary and secondary transits of almost the same depth , again leading to an erroneous period and an increased exoplanet diagnostic . in",
    "what follows , we ignore these effects , concentrating on information from the diagnostic alone , and assuming circular orbits .",
    "figures 5 - 7 show how the diagnostic @xmath42 evolves for blends compared to exoplanets for a variety of assumptions and conditions .",
    "the modeled blends are created by combining modeled light curves of blends and adding the proper amount of light from the ` primary' ( the constant , brighter component for blends and the parent star for exoplanets ) to create a transit of the desired depth .",
    "these figures are designed to illustrate the overall effectiveness of the diagnostic under different conditions .",
    "when studying these figures , it is important to remember that the spectral type of the primary component of a blend has nothing to do with the spectral type of the eclipsing component  it only provides photons to make the observed transits shallower .    figure 5 shows how the diagnostic @xmath42 evolves for blends relative to exoplanets for different spectral types and transit percentages , assuming that nothing is known about the `` primary '' and therefore using @xmath59 when calculating @xmath42 . the lines help to illustrate the likelihood of finding a blends with the listed spectral type and transit percentage that have similar diagnostic to exoplanets .",
    "the shaded regions show what diagnostics exoplanets with radii from @xmath60 ( right boundary ) to @xmath61 ( left boundary ) and transit percentages from 0% ( top ) to 75% ( bottom ) would produce if the `` primary '' was an f2 star ( angled @xmath62 to the right ) , a solar - type star ( horizontal dotted lines ) and an m3 star ( angled @xmath62 to the left ) .",
    "unblended binaries occupy the right - hand end of each line . from this figure , it is clear that in most cases , even without any knowledge of the `` primary '' , most blends are distinguishable from exoplanets in the case of circular orbits , even for exoplanets smaller than earth .",
    "this is especially true for blends involving earlier - type eclipsing binaries , as those tend to have relatively long transits .",
    "figure 6 shows how @xmath42 is influenced specifically by the spectral type of the binary in the blend for different transit percentages . here",
    "too it is evident that later main - sequence spectral types in the binary produce lower diagnostics .",
    "as this is due to the shorter transit durations ( from the lower stellar radii ) , giant and sub - giant binaries in blends would produce very high diagnostics that would be easily separable from exoplanets .",
    "the shaded regions in this figure are identical to those in fig .",
    "this figure also shows that a relatively high percentage of blends can be separated from exoplanets , especially those orbiting late spectral - type parent stars .",
    "incorporating an estimate of the primary radius improves the performance of the diagnostic .",
    "figure 7 is similar to figure 6 , except that stellar radii are assumed to be known to within 20% ( top ) and 5% ( bottom ) .",
    "for clarity , only the highest ( f2/f2 binary ) and the lowest ( m3/m3 binary ) of the 70% transit percentage contours are shown .",
    "information on stellar radii affects the locations of the exoplanet regions so that central transits have a diagnostic close to one , within the limits of the errors , which is quite different from earlier figures .",
    "moreover , the imprecision in the estimate of stellar radius affects the diagnostics of the blends as well . in this figure ,",
    "the information on spectral type show that blends in which the `` primary '' is a late spectral type will be the easiest to separate from exoplanets , while those involving the earliest spectral types will not gain much from the use of the diagnostic . to date , only about 12% of exoplanets discovered with either radial velocity or transits have been around f stars .",
    "this of course could be affected by the choice of stars in radial velocity searches .",
    "we have devised an exoplanet diagnostic @xmath0 and shown that it can be an effective tool in choosing transit candidates worthy of follow - up observation . using our diagnotic , many eclipsing binary stars , especially those involving giants , and blends can be excluded from further consideration . specifically , we suggest that ogle - tr-33 is unlikely to be planetary , while our analysis indicated that ogle - tr-10 had a high likelihood of begin planetary before it was confirmed @xcite .",
    "estimates of stellar radii improve the performance of the diagnostic , giving it an even greater ability to identify the events that are non - exoplanetary in origin",
    ". the diagnostic will be particularly useful for bodies ( such as hot jupiters ) that have circular orbits .",
    "the addition of eccentricity to the analysis leads to an increased spread in the diagnostic , but does not critically impair the method .",
    "transits are more likely to occur in portions of an eccentric orbit where @xmath6 exceeds @xmath63 , leading to a reduction in the average diagnostic for exoplanetary systems with a given period .",
    "overall , we encourage the use of this diagnostic tool in the search for exoplanets via transits to reduce the large numbers of candidates that require resource - consuming follow - up observations .",

    "<S> one of the obstacles in the search for exoplanets via transits is the large number of candidates that must be followed up , few of which ultimately prove to be exoplanets . </S>",
    "<S> any method that could make this process more efficient by somehow identifying the best candidates and eliminating the worst would therefore be very useful . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated that it was possible to discern between blends and exoplanets using only the photometric characteristics of the transits . </S>",
    "<S> however , these techniques are critically dependent on the shape of the transit , characterization of which requires very high precision photometry of a sort that is atypical for candidates identified from transit searches . </S>",
    "<S> we present a method relying only on transit duration , depth , and period , which require much less precise photometry to determine accurately . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical tool we derive , the exoplanet diagnostic @xmath0 , is intended to identify the subset of candidates from a transit search that is most likely to contain exoplanets , and thus most worthy of subsequent follow - up studies . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of the diagnostic is demonstrated with its success in separating modeled exoplanetary transits and interlopers , and by applying it to actual ogle transit candidates . </S>"
