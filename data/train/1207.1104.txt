    "the key feature of a topological superconductor ( tsc ) in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) @xcite is a topologically protected holographic single majorana bound state ( mbs ) associated with each of its ends .",
    "the recently proposed realization of the 1d tsc in an insb nanowire with strong spin orbit interaction ( soi ) and proximity induced s - wave superconductivity @xcite is so far the most promising candidate as to its experimental feasibility .",
    "meanwhile , first experimental signatures of mbs have been reported by several experimental groups @xcite , however , it should be mentioned that alternative explanations for robust zero bias resonances not owing to majorana zeromodes have been brought forward @xcite .",
    "formally , the presence of the mbs is protected by particle hole symmetry ( phs ) .",
    "note , however , that the phs in this class of systems does not imply a physical symmetry constraint on the underlying band structure of the normal - conducting spin orbit coupled quantum wire .",
    "rather , the phs is emergent from the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) mean field description of superconductivity : the bdg band structure consists of two copies of the electronic band structure where the energy spectrum of the hole bands is mirrored as compared to the equivalent electron bands .",
    "this enforces the spectrum generating symmetry",
    " hole bands and electron bands are conjugated by phs ( see ref . for a detailed discussion of this point ) . an additional chiral symmetry present in the ideal model systems proposed in refs . promotes the @xmath0  invariant characterizing the presence of an unpaired mbs to a @xmath1  invariant @xcite counting the number of zeromodes at each edge .",
    "however , perturbations modifying the soi as well as magnetic impurities can break the chiral symmetry and gap out paired mbs .",
    "the influence of interactions on the topological classification of chiral 1d systems has been analyzed from a matrix product state perspective @xcite .",
    "the classification of a chiral 1d system in terms of its single particle green s function has also been reported @xcite .",
    "aditionally , the robustness of the tsc phase in interacting nanowires has been investigated using renormalization group ( rg ) methods @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , we extend the original @xmath0  classification in terms of the pfaffian of the hamiltonian in majorana representation reported in ref . by including both disorder and adiabatic interactions into the classification scheme .",
    "we present the @xmath0-classification of the 1d tsc phase which , without additional symmetries , generically belongs to the cartan - altland - zirnbauer class @xmath2 @xcite , in terms of its single particle green s function . in a first step , we work out explicitly a dimensional extension procedure for a realization of the 1d tsc in a nanowire with strong soi and proximity induced s - wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the dimensional extension allows us to reduce the topological classification of the 1d tsc to that of the 2d @xmath3  superconductor representing the extended 2d system .",
    "the 2d @xmath3  superconductor is the bdg analog of the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect @xcite which is characterized by its first chern number .",
    "this procedure fits into the general classification framework of topological field theory ( tft ) proposed for time reversal invariant topological insulators in refs . .",
    "this framework allows for a reformulation of the invariant in terms of the single particle green s function .",
    "we note that when going beyond mean field the many body hamiltonian does not show the emergent phs that is present in the bdg mean field descritption of superconductivity .",
    "however , as we discuss in detail below , the single particle green s function in nambu space still has a built in phs @xcite in the presence of arbitrary correlations as an exact feature which is crucial for the construction of the topological invariant via dimensional extension . upon switching on interactions adiabatically , our classification remains valid for luttinger liquid like interactions as argued in ref . .",
    "to further simplify the practical calculation of the @xmath0-invariant , we employ a recently proposed generalized berry curvature method @xcite which has been applied to 2d and 3d tsc in ref . .",
    "we show that the interacting invariant can be expressed in terms of the zero frequency single particle green s function of the physical 1d system , which is independent of the previously introduced extra dimension .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how a hybrid approach of twisted boundary conditions ( tbc ) @xcite in the physical dimension and periodic boundary conditions in the extra dimension can be used to additionally include disorder at the level of the bulk topological invariant , i.e. without probing the presence of unpaired mbs , quantized zero bias resonances , or other finite size effects .",
    "thus , this approach enables us to topologically classify a 1d tsc in the presence of disorder _ and _ electron - electron interaction .",
    "a lattice model of the 1d tsc @xcite can be cast into the form @xmath4 , where the basis is chosen such that @xmath5 . in this basis",
    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath6 for the 1d tsc , @xmath7  is the hamiltonian of a single channel quantum wire in the presence of a @xmath8-field induced zeeman splitting and rashba soi .",
    "the proximity induced s - wave superconducting gap is of the form @xmath9  and @xmath10 . introducing the set of pauli - matrices @xmath11  for the particle hole pseudo spin ,",
    "the bdg bloch hamiltonian reads @xmath12 in this representation , the phs operation has the intuitive form @xmath13 where @xmath14  denotes complex conjugation .",
    "let us very briefly review the salient physics starting from the continuum model obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ham ] ) by substituting @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the band structure consists of two particle hole symmetric copies ( emergent from the bdg picture ) of the shifted rashba parabolae .",
    "the lattice regularization in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ham ] ) is introduced to make the topological invariants well defined .",
    "gaps out the system in its entire brillouin zone ( bz ) . for small @xmath18",
    "this gap competes with a zeeman gap due to @xmath19  leading to a band inversion at @xmath20 . for @xmath21",
    "we have a tsc with a single mbs associated with each end of a finite wire .",
    "applying the general outline in ref . , we explicitly perform a dimensional extension introducing an extra coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "thereby , we connect the 1d tsc state to its 2d parent state , the 2d p+ip superconductor @xcite , which is characterized by its first chern number .",
    "this reduces the topological classification of the noninteracting model to the analysis of the superconducting analog of the qah effect with chiral majorana edge states in the extended 2d system .",
    "the idea of this procedure is quite simple : our system can not be deformed into a trivial 1d superconductor without breaking phs which provides the topological protection of the tsc phase .",
    "however , breaking this constraint , we can deform the tsc , say upon varying @xmath22  from @xmath23  to @xmath24 , into a trivial 1d superconductor without ever closing the bulk gap of the instantaneous system .",
    "it is crucial to perform the particle hole conjugated interpolation to the same trivial state for @xmath25 $ ]  in such a way that the resulting 2d system is @xmath26-periodic in the extra coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "then , the extended 2d system is again in the same symmetry class @xmath2  and its first chern number @xmath27 , is well defined independently of our concrete choice of the interpoloation up to even integers @xcite .",
    "this means that a @xmath0  information , namely @xmath28 ,  is well defined and only depends on the physical 1d system .",
    "it is worth noting that finding a suitable interpolation is nontrivial and requires some insight into the physical mechanisms underlying the model . in the following",
    ", we will explicitly present an extension which works for a generic 1d tsc and can also be used later on for the disordered interacting system .",
    "the main steps are as follows : first , we switch on a fictitious particle hole breaking gap @xmath29  which will keep the gap open for @xmath30 . for the 2d system",
    ", this term amounts to a @xmath31-wave superconducting pairing whereas the intermediate 1d systems are only formally defined because they break the emergent phs symmetry of the bdg picture .",
    "however , the procedure is still well defined since the physical information is only encoded in the original 1d system . during the deformation ,",
    "the band inversion is destroyed by a term @xmath32  which vanishes for the physical model ( @xmath33 ) . for sufficiently large @xmath34  this term will produce a trivial superconducting phase for @xmath35  as it enhances the superconducting gap by @xmath36  beyond the critical strength @xmath37 . in summary ,",
    "the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) @xcite extended hamiltonian reads @xmath38 integrating the berry curvature @xmath39  of this hamiltonian over the @xmath40  bz indeed yields @xmath41 valid for parameters close enough to the band inversion that no artificial level crossings which depend on the details of the lattice regularization occur .",
    "+    for nontrivial parameters ( @xmath42 ) left and trivial parameters ( @xmath43 ) right .",
    "@xmath44  in both plots . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cleancomp ] , we compare the berry curvature of an extension of a nontrivial 1d tsc with that of a trivial superconducting wire . in the extra dimension @xmath22 , the modulus of the curvature is smoothly decaying without any notable difference between the trivial and the nontrivial case .",
    "this is reflected in our derivation below , which shows that the topological invariant of the translation - invariant system can be defined in terms of its single particle green s function without reference to the extra dimension .",
    "note that this picture changes in the framework of tbc as introduced to account for the presence of disorder as is discussed below and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discomp ] . +",
    "we now discuss the possiblity to include interactions into the proposed classification scheme by generalizing the chern number of the noninteracting system to a topological invariant of the single particle green s function in combined frequency momentum space , as has been proposed for time reversal invariant topological insulators in 2d and 3d @xcite . in even spatial dimension @xmath45 ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the homotopy of the single particle green s function determines the hall conductance @xmath46  ( @xmath47 ) and its higher dimensional analogues , respectively , of an insulating fermionic system .",
    "it has been explicitly demonstrated @xcite that this representation of @xmath46  adiabatically connects to the @xmath48th - chern number associated with the berry curvature of a bloch hamiltonian in the non - interacting limit .",
    "the adiabatic assumption in this case implies that the gapped ground state of the interacting system can be continuously connected to the manifold of occupied single particle levels of the noninteracting system which is also separated from the empty states by a finite energy gap .",
    "the most prominent example of interactions which are non - adiabatic in the sense just defined lead to the @xmath49  fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect in a partially filled lowest landau level ( lll ) . in this case ,",
    "the noninteracting system is gapless and the single particle states that span the lll split into @xmath50  degenerate ground states when tbc are applied @xcite .",
    "this ground state degeneracy is at the basis of the concept of topological order @xcite which rigorously classifies fqh systems .    in 1d",
    ", interactions play a peculiar role generically leading to non - fermi - liquid behavior . from a viewpoint of perturbation theory interactions",
    "are therefore considered to be non - adiabatic in 1d , as no meaningful quasiparticles can be defined .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that the fermi surface properties as described by the momentum space topology of the single particle green s function are still adiabatically connected to those of the non - interacting system .",

    "recently , it has been generally shown @xcite that for an interacting system , an invariant of this form can be simplified by introducing a generalized berry curvature @xmath57  associated with the fictitious non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath58 , which takes into account the eigenvectors @xmath59  of @xmath60  with positive eigenvalues , the so called r - zeros @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath61  labels the internal degrees of freedom of the single particle green s function like orbital labels and spin .",

    "@xcite the @xmath0  classification of the particle hole symmetric 1d system can then be further simplified to @xmath63 where @xmath64  is the polarization of the physical 1d system and @xmath65  is the generalized berry connection restricted to the physical system at @xmath33 , i.e. at @xmath66 .",
    "note that this general form does no longer depend on the dimensional extension procedure and can be calculated once the zero frequency single particle green s function @xmath67  is known .",
    "finally , the @xmath68-invariant can be practically determined by formal analogy to the non - interacting case by calculating the majorana number @xcite defined in terms of the pfaffian of the fictitious non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath69  in majorana representation . + we would like to point out some subtleties in our analysis stemming from the fact that we are dealing with a superconducting system here rather than a normal insulator .",
    "most importantly , it is not obvious how the emergent phs present in the bdg mean field description translates to a many body hamiltonian which has terms that are quartic in the field operators .",
    "more concretely , a standard hubbard interaction term @xmath70  does not change sign under the particle hole conjugation @xmath71 .",
    "however , the generalization of our dimensional extension procedure to interacting systems only relies on a built in particle hole symmetry for the single particle green s function and not for the many body hamiltonian . in the absence of interactions , the phs operation ( [ eqn : phs ] ) of the mean field hamiltonian ( [ eqn : ham ] ) can be expressed for the free nambu green s function as @xmath72 in ref .",
    ", it has been shown using the spectral representation that this phs emergent from the nambu spinor representation of the green s function remains an exact feature for the nambu green s function associated with an arbitrary many - body hamiltonian .",
    "this observation renders our dimensional extension arguments well defined in the presence of interactions .",
    "+ furthermore , we note that the physical interpretation of the invariant @xmath50  as a polarization in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pol ] ) does not imply immediate observable consequences since it represents a polarization of bogoliubov quasiparticles that do not have a well defined electric charge .",
    "along similar lines , the chern number of the 2d @xmath3  superconductor is known not to be in one to one correspondence to a quantized hall conductivity .",
    "our formulation so far has been relying on translation - invariance which implies the existence of a bz .",
    "this description will thus no longer be applicable in the presence of disorder .",
    "to this end , the concept of tbc has been introduced to topologically classify quantum hall systems in the absence of translation - invariance @xcite . as long as a bulk mobility gap is present ,",
