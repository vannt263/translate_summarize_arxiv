    "in this paper we consider the advection and diffusion equation @xmath3 for a scalar quantity @xmath4 on the space - time hypersurface @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a closed @xmath1-dimensional moving hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "such equations arise in many applications such as processes on biological cell surfaces , @xcite and the transport of surfactants on fluid interfaces , @xcite .",
    "the variational hilbert space theory for the initial value problem has been considered in @xcite .    here",
    "the motion of the hypersurface is assumed to be periodic in time with period @xmath7 in the sense that @xmath8 .",
    "the velocity , @xmath9 , of the moving hypersurface @xmath6 is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the normal velocity of @xmath6 and @xmath12 is an advective velocity field tangential to @xmath6 .",
    "the tangential gradient and the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath6 are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the material derivative @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 a solution @xmath17 of the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) is called periodic if @xmath18    the aim of this work is to establish the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions . since the mass @xmath19 of a solution @xmath0 of the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) evolves according to @xmath20 a necessary condition for @xmath0 to be periodic",
    "is that @xmath21 however , please note that neither @xmath22 nor the velocity @xmath23 is supposed to be periodic .",
    "that is , in general @xmath24 as well as @xmath25 .",
    "although we prove a slightly more general result , the main result of this paper is that for each given mass @xmath26 there exists a unique periodic solution @xmath27 of the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) with initial mass @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 denotes a suitable hlder space , which we introduce below .    since for @xmath30 the mass @xmath31 of a solution @xmath0 is constant in time",
    ", @xmath0 describes a conservative scalar quantity in this case . in order to prove existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions to the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) we have to look at slightly more general linear parabolic partial differential equations on @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , we have to consider advection - diffusion equations of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a scalar function on the space - time hypersurface @xmath35 that is not required to be periodic .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the periodicity condition in ( [ periodic_condition ] ) is too restrictive in this case even if we assume ( [ condition_on_f ] ) , since in general the mass of a solution @xmath0 to the equation ( [ gen_advec_diff_eq ] ) can not be periodic in time , that is @xmath36 .",
    "the reason for this is the zero - order term in ( [ gen_advec_diff_eq ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath30 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 the mass decays exponentially , that is @xmath39 .",
    "hence , a periodic solution would have to satisfy @xmath40 in this case , which is , however , a much too restrictive assumption for applications .",
    "therefore , we slightly relax the notion of periodicity to @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the mean value of @xmath0 on @xmath43 .",
    "fortunately , for the advection - diffusion equation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) this condition is equivalent to the condition ( [ periodic_condition ] ) as long as the constraint ( [ condition_on_f ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the study of time - periodic solutions to both linear and non - linear parabolic equations has a long history , see for example @xcite and references therein , in particular @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as well as @xcite and @xcite . however , we are not aware of any previous analytic work that studies the periodic problem on moving hypersurfaces .",
    "our methodology reformulates the problem on a moving closed hypersurface to a problem on a fixed hypersurface with time varying coefficients . in order to obtain some analytic results",
    "it is then useful to relate the hypersurface equation to a neumann type boundary problem on a flat domain , see the appendix for further explanations .",
    "observe that the problem in our case is slightly more involved than the results on the oblique derivative problems for flat domains in @xcite , since we can not assume that the zero order term @xmath44 is non - negative .",
    "for example for the choice @xmath45 this is certainly not true in general .",
    "the fact that the zero - order term @xmath44 can be negative is indeed the reason , why this paper is beyond the scope of previous works .",
    "furthermore , the slightly weaker periodicity condition ( [ general_periodic_condition ] ) , which ensures the existence of periodic solutions for any initial mass @xmath46 , does not seem to have been used in the literature so far .",
    "anyway , it is still possible to adopt the techniques used by lieberman in @xcite to our problem .",
    "therefore , our existence proof mainly relies on a simple fixed point iteration and standard fredholm theory .",
    "our work is partially motivated by numerical simulations of periodic solutions of advection - diffusion equations on moving @xmath47-dimensional surfaces for @xmath30 performed in @xcite using an evolving surface finite element method .",
    "the periodic solutions were obtained by computing the initial value problem for arbitrary chosen initial conditions .",
    "indeed , the numerical solutions for different initial conditions with same initial mass appear to converge very quickly to the same time - periodic solution .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in this numerical work the formulation ( [ advec_diff_eq ] ) , which entirely avoids the use of local coordinates and surface parametrisations , is very suitable for the evolving surface finite element method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the notation and the parabolic hlder spaces on the space - time hypersurface @xmath32 as well as their associated norms .",
    "then we rewrite the advection - diffusion equation on the moving hypersurface @xmath6 as an advection - diffusion equation with time - dependent coefficients on a fixed reference hypersurface @xmath48 .",
    "this formulation is more amenable for our purposes , since it can be easily related to a ( non - degenerate ) neumann type boundary problem on a flat domain .",
    "we derive this neumann boundary problem in the appendix . in section @xmath47",
    ", we summarize the results of this paper .",
    "this also serves as a reader s guide to the proof of the main result in theorem [ main_result ] .",
    "the detailed proofs of all results given in section @xmath47 can be found in section @xmath49 . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the technique to extend a surface partial differential equation to a non - degenerate partial differential equation on an extended neighbourhood .",
    "this result is used in section @xmath47 and @xmath49 to prove existence and uniqueness to the initial boundary value problem on hypersurfaces without using any local parametrizations of the hypersurface .",
    "we make use of the convention to sum over repeated indices .",
    "henceforward , we assume that @xmath2 is a family of closed ( that is compact and without boundary ) , orientable , connected , @xmath1-dimensional , embedded hypersurfaces of class @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , and that there is a closed , orientable , connected , @xmath1-dimensional , embedded hypersurface @xmath52 of the same class and a @xmath50-embedding @xmath53 from the closure of the cylinder @xmath54 onto @xmath55 such that for any @xmath56 $ ] the map @xmath57 is a bijection from @xmath48 onto @xmath6 .",

    "note that we use the notation @xmath60 for functions continuously differentiable in time and twice continuously differentiable in space .",
    "we also assume that the motion of @xmath6 is periodic in time in the sense that @xmath8 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath62 be an arbitrary hypersurface .",
    "the tangent space to @xmath63 at the point @xmath64 is the linear space @xmath65 see @xcite . for a function @xmath22 on an arbitrary hypersurface @xmath63 differentiable at @xmath64 , we define the tangential gradient of @xmath22 at @xmath64 by @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes a differentiable extension of @xmath22 to an open neighbourhood @xmath68 of @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 , see @xcite for more details . here , @xmath71 denotes the euclidean scalar product in the ambient space , @xmath72 is a unit normal of @xmath63 at @xmath69 and @xmath73 is the projection onto the tangent space of @xmath63 at @xmath69 .",
    "the components of the tangential gradient are denoted by @xmath74 for a twice continuously differentiable function @xmath22 on @xmath63 we have the commutator rule @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the ( extended ) weingarten map on @xmath63 .",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath63 is defined by @xmath77    these definitions can be easily generalized to moving hypersurfaces @xmath6 , as well as to the space - derivatives on the space - time hypersurfaces @xmath78 and @xmath32 .",
