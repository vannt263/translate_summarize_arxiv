    "understanding how nuclear forces emerge from the fundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) remains an outstanding problem in theoretical physics . to study the physics of hadrons at scales where qcd is strongly coupled ,",
    "it is useful to employ the technique of effective field theories . model independent predictions for low energy nuclear phenomena can be made by using an effective lagrangian which includes nucleons and pions as explicit degrees of freedom and all possible interactions that are consistent with the symmetries of the underlying qcd theory .",
    "this method , known as chiral perturbation theory , has been successfully applied to processes involving 0 and 1 nucleons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "weinberg @xcite originally proposed using effective field theory for few body problems in nuclear physics .",
    "weinberg s procedure applies ordinary chiral perturbation theory power counting to the nucleon - nucleon potential and then solves the schrdinger equation using this potential .",
    "phenomenological studies of nn scattering phase shifts and deuteron properties which use this technique can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "application of effective field theory to two nucleon systems is complicated by the existence of a shallow bound state in the spin triplet channel and the large scattering length in the spin singlet channel . in refs .",
    "@xcite , kaplan , savage , and wise ( ksw ) proposed a new power counting which accounts for these effects .",
    "this approach is more like ordinary chiral perturbation theory in that power counting is applied to the amplitude rather than the potential .",
    "all observables are expanded in powers of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is either @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( the nucleon momentum ) , and @xmath14 is the range of the effective field theory . because the s - wave scattering lengths ( denoted by @xmath15 ) are large , powers of @xmath16 must be summed to all orders @xcite .",
    "this requires a nonperturbative treatment of the leading 4 nucleon operators with no derivatives .",
    "higher derivative operators and pions are treated perturbatively .",
    "the perturbative treatment of pions makes it possible to obtain analytic expressions for amplitudes .",
    "one theoretically appealing aspect of the ksw power counting is that all ultraviolet divergences appearing in loop graphs are cancelled by contact operators appearing at either the same or a lower order in the expansion .",
    "this is in contrast with weinberg s approach in which unsubtracted divergences introduce cutoff dependence which is cancelled at higher orders in the expansion .",
    "the residual dependence on the cutoff gives an estimate of the size of higher order corrections .",
    "it is clear from naive dimensional analysis that the ksw expansion will converge slowly . to see this , compare the contribution to the amplitude from single pion exchange and the pion box diagram : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are dimensionless functions .",
    "the factor of @xmath19 , the nucleon mass , comes from performing the energy integral by contour integration and taking a pole from one of the nucleon propagators .",
    "the factor of @xmath20 is an estimate of the size of the loop correction .",
    "( if a pion pole is taken the contribution is smaller by @xmath21 @xcite . ) from eq .",
    "( [ pilps ] ) one expects an expansion parameter of order @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that perturbative pions will converge , albeit slowly .",
    "many processes involving two nucleons have been computed to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the ksw expansion @xcite .",
    "the results of some of these calculations are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "typically , one finds 30%40% errors at leading order ( lo ) and 10% errors at nlo .",
    "these results suggest an expansion parameter @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of the expansion parameter given above . obviously , it is important to extend existing calculations to higher orders to see if the convergence of the expansion persists .    at the present time , few nnlo calculations , nlo is @xmath25 , and nnlo is order @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "this terminology will be used even for cases where the lo contribution vanishes . ]",
    "are available in the theory with pions .",
    "the deuteron quadrupole moment is calculated to nnlo in ref .",
    "the result of the nnlo calculation of the @xmath0 phase shift has been presented in ref.@xcite and independently in ref.@xcite . however , these @xmath0 calculations are incomplete because the full order @xmath11 contributions from radiation pion graphs were not included . the @xmath26 mixing parameter is calculated to nnlo in ref.@xcite , where it is demonstrated that the expansion is converging for @xmath27 . for these momenta ,",
    "the error is comparable to that of calculations within the weinberg approach  @xcite .    in this paper , we present nnlo calculations of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 phase shifts in nucleon - nucleon scattering , including contributions from radiation pions . at this order",
    "we find that the radiation pion diagrams have trivial momentum dependence and their effect can not be distinguished from the contributions of a local operator . in the @xmath0 channel , the nnlo fit agrees with data to @xmath31% accuracy for @xmath32 . in this channel ,",
    "the ksw expansion works as expected .",
    "however , in the spin triplet channel we find that the expansion breaks down at nnlo . for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 phase shifts ,",
    "the nnlo calculation actually does worse at fitting the data than the nlo prediction . in the @xmath1 channel , the nnlo corrections are as large as the nlo corrections for @xmath33 . in the @xmath2 channel",
    "there is no sign of convergence for any value of @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the failure of the eft expansion in these two triplet channels is due to large non - analytic corrections that grow with @xmath13 coming from graphs with two potential pions .",
    "these terms do not appear in the spin singlet channel .",
    "the reason for the difference in the quality of the perturbative expansions in the two channels is that the potential between nucleons arising from pion exchange is much more singular in the spin triplet channel than in the singlet channel .",
    "we elaborate on this point in section [ discuss ] of the paper .",
    "next , we examine the nnlo predictions for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 wave phase shifts drawing on results from ref .",
    "@xcite . at lo",
    "these phase shifts vanish . in these channels",
    "the only contributions at nlo and nnlo come from potential pion exchange .",
    "contact interaction and radiative pion contributions do not enter until higher order .",
    "thus predictions for these phase shifts contain no free parameters , and it is possible to unambiguously test the perturbative treatment of pions . in the spin singlet channels ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) corrections from two potential pion exchange are small , and the errors at @xmath33 are ( 13% , 33% ) . at @xmath33 , the nnlo predictions for the @xmath38 , @xmath39 channels have errors of the expected size ( 15% , 8% ) . in the @xmath40",
    ", @xmath41 channels errors are bigger than expected ( 170% , 52% ) . like the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , these spin triplet channels have non - analytic contributions that grow with @xmath13 .",
    "our final section includes a comparison of our calculations with those of refs.@xcite which use the weinberg approach . in spin singlet channels the corrections obtained by summing perturbative potential pion exchange to all orders are negligible . in particular , in the @xmath3 and @xmath5 channels ,",
    "single pion exchange gives the same answer as the lo weinberg calculation which treats potential pions nonperturbatively . here",
    "corrections from soft and radiation pion graphs as well as contact interactions appear to be much more important . in the ksw expansion",
    ", these effects appear at one higher order than the results presented in this paper .    in some spin triplet channels ( @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath2 ) the summation of potential pions gives significant improvement relative to the calculation which treats the pion perturbatively .",
    "there are also spin triplet channels where nonperturbative potential pions seem to be less important than soft pion graphs and four nucleon operators .",
    "this is true in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels , where the lo calculation in the weinberg scheme does no better than the lo term in the ksw expansion .",
    "finally , in the @xmath6 channels , the ksw expansion at nnlo gives predictions that are as accurate as the nnlo weinberg calculations and so a nonperturbative treatment of pions does not seem to be necessary in these channels .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the formalism relevant for our calculation is introduced .",
    "we define all operators appearing in the lagrangian to the order we are working and discuss the solution to their renormalization group equations ( rge ) . solving",
