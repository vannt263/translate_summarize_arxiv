    "game theory  @xcite has proved extremely useful in the study of economic , social , and biological situations for describing interactions between agents having possibly different and often conflicting objectives .",
    "paradigmatic games such as the prisoner s dilemma  @xcite have been used in order to represent the tension that appears in society when individual objectives are in conflict with socially desirable outcomes .",
    "most of the vast research literature has focused on conflicting situations in order to uncover the mechanisms that could lead to cooperation instead of socially harmful outcomes ( see e.g.  @xcite for a synthesis ) . however , there are important situations in society that do not require players to use aggressive strategies .",
    "in fact , many frequent social and economic activities require individuals to coordinate their actions on a common goal since in many cases the best course of action is to conform to the standard behavior .",
    "for example , if one is used to drive on the right side of the road and travels to a country where the norm is reversed , it pays off to follow the local norm .",
    "bargaining and contracts are also of this type because , even though expectancies may be different between a buyer and a seller , still both would rather trade than not , provided that the respective prices are not too different . for another example , consider a situation in which coordination in working contributions is required in order to produce a good or a service . in a group",
    "it might pay off not to contribute , if this behavior goes unnoticed , but the total output will be negatively affected .",
    "games that express this extremely common kind of interactions are called _",
    "coordination games_.    coordination games confront the players with multiple nash equilibria and the ensuing problem of equilibrium selection .",
    "given that these equilibria are equivalent from the game - theoretical point of view , how to explain how agents make their decisions ?",
    "a useful approach has been to use evolutionary and learning ideas which offer a dynamical perspective based on the forces of biological and social evolution . in _ evolutionary game theory _ ( egt ) , the concept of a population of players where strategies that score best are more likely to be selected and reproduced provides a justification for the appearance of stable states of the dynamics that represent solutions of the game  @xcite . + for mathematical convenience , standard egt is based on infinite mixing populations where pairs of individuals are drawn uniformly at random at each step and play the game .",
    "correlations are absent by definition and the population has an homogeneous structure .",
    "however , everyday observation tells us that in animal and human societies , individuals usually tend to interact more often with some specified subset of partners ; for instance , teenagers tend to adopt the fashions of their close friends group ; closely connected groups usually follow the same religion , and so on . likewise , in the economic world , a group of firms might be directly connected because they share capital , technology , or otherwise interact in some way . in short , social interaction",
    "is mediated by networks , in which vertices identify people , firms etc . , and edges identify some kind of relation between the concerned vertices such as friendship , collaboration , economic exchange and so on .",
    "thus , locality of interaction plays an important role .",
    "this kind of approach was pioneered in egt by nowak and may  @xcite by using simple two - dimensional regular grids . recently , in the wake of a surge of activity in network research in many fields  @xcite , the dynamical and evolutionary behavior of games on networks that are more likely to represent actual social interactions than regular grids has been investigated ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive recent review ) .",
    "these studies , almost exclusively conducted on games of conflict such as the prisoner s dilemma or hawks - doves , have shown that there are network structures , such as scale - free and actual social networks that may favor the emergence of cooperation with respect to the fully mixing populations used in the theory  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend this kind of approach to games of the coordination type .",
    "we shall use several types of network structures , both networks generated by an algorithm as well as an actual social network to try to unravel the effect of structure on the population behavior . in the present paper",
    ", we ignore that social networks are actually dynamical entities that change constantly .",
    "indeed , actors join and leave networks and they may accumulate and abandon ties over time . using static networks",
    "is a useful first approximation however , especially for the cases where the rate of change of the network structure is slow with respect to the rate of change of individual s behaviors which is the approximation that is made here .",
    "comparatively little theoretical work has been done on coordination games on networks , except for some standard types such as rings or complete networks  @xcite for which rigorous results have been obtained thanks to their regular structure .",
    "although we do mention some known rigorous results as discussed below , our methodology is essentially computer simulation - based .",
    "this is because for most network types , inhomogeneity and correlations do not allow standard mean - field methods to be used .",
    "likewise , pair approximation methods  @xcite provide an acceptable approach for random and regular graphs but not for the other more complex types and thus they are not used here .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we first present a brief introduction to the subject of coordination games , in order to make the work self - contained . then , in sect .  [ maths ]",
    ", we enumerate the main theoretical results on coordination games , as well as the necessary definitions for networks of agents and their dynamics . in sect .",
    "[ num ] we describe the simulation methodology and the parameters used and , in sect .  [ sim - results ] we present and discuss the simulation results on various network classes first for pure coordination games , and then for general coordination ones . finally , in sect .",
    "[ concl ] we give our conclusions and ideas for future work .",
    "general two - person , two strategies coordination games have the normal form of table  [ coord - game ] . with @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both nash equilibria .",
    "now , if we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath5 then @xmath3 is the risk - dominant equilibrium , while @xmath2 is the pareto - dominant one .",
    "this simply means that players get a higher payoff by coordinating on @xmath2 but they risk less by using strategy @xmath6 instead .",
    "there is also a third equilibrium in mixed strategies but it is evolutionarily unstable .    .a",
    "general two - person , two strategies coordination game.[coord - game ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure  [ sh ] shows strategy distribution on the game parameter space for the stag hunt class of coordination games for the scale - free case .",

    "figures on the left column are for best response dynamics without noise , while those on the right column represent a situation in which the probability of mutation @xmath10 .",
    "darker colors mean that risk - dominance prevails ; light color design the region where payoff - dominance prevails .",
    "[ sh],width=453 ]    the two upper images are for equal initial proportions of each strategy , while the bottom figures refer to an initial proportion of strategy @xmath11 .",
    "the first image in each row is for best response without noise , while the second image has noise level @xmath10 .",
    "+ for initially equidistributed strategies , although average values are reported in the figures , almost all simulations attain one or the other absorbing state , i.e. all individuals play @xmath8 or all play @xmath6 , and there is almost no difference when noise is present .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results on scale - free graphs published by roca et al .",
    "@xcite where update was by best response without noise , and also with  @xcite where replicator dynamics instead of best response dynamics was used as a strategy update rule . + for the more extreme case in which initially the fraction of strategy @xmath8 is @xmath9 randomly distributed over the graph vertices ( bottom row images ) , a small amount of random noise does not have a large effect : the cooperative strategy emerges in the favorable region of the parameter space , i.e. for low @xmath12 and high @xmath13 ( upper left corner ) in both cases .",
    "however , the presence of noise enhances the efficient coordination region .",
    "indeed , even when strategy @xmath8 is initially absent , once it is created by mutation , it spreads as in the @xmath9 case .",
    "it is to be noted that the same phenomenon happens when the minority strategy is @xmath14 ; in this case the images are specularly symmetrical , and with colors reversed , with respect to the main diagonal , except for sampling differences ( not shown to save space ) .",
    "+ figure  [ sh2 ] depicts average results for the model social network case of toivonen et al .",
    "results for the collaboration network are very close to those of model social networks .",
    "for this reason , and in order not to clutter the graphics too much , we do not show them .    [ !",

    "darker colors mean that risk - dominance prevails ; light color design the region where payoff - dominance prevails.[sh2],width=453 ]    it is immediately apparent that the case in which strategies are initially randomly distributed in equal amounts seems similar to the scale - free results .",
    "however , looking more carefully , the average results shown in the figures hide to some extent the fact that now many simulations do not end in one of the monomorphic population states , but rather there is a mix of the two strategies , when noise is absent .",
    "this is visible in the upper left figure in the less crisp frontier along the diagonal which is due to a more gradual transition between phase space regions .",
    "however , when a small amount of noise is present ( upper right image ) the transition is again sharp and the dynamics usually leads to a monomorphic population in which one of the two absorbing states is entered .",
    "the reason why there can be mixed states in the noiseless case in social networks is related to their mesoscopic structure . as we have seen in sect .",
    "[ communities ] , model and real social networks can be partitioned into recognizable clusters . within these clusters strategies",
    "may become dominant as in the pure coordination case just by chance .",
    "in other words , as soon as a strategy dominates in a given cluster , it is difficult to eradicate it from outside since other communities , being weakly connected , have little influence .",
    "this kind of effect in the stag hunt game has been observed previously in simulations on grid - structured populations  @xcite .",
    "however , grid structures are not socially realistic ; thus , the fact that more likely social structure do support efficient outcomes is an encouraging result .",
    "however , when noise is present , there is always the possibility that the other strategy appears in the cluster by statistical fluctuations and , from there , it can takeover the whole community . to end this section , we remark that analogous effects due to the presence of clusters in social networks have been observed and interpreted in the prisoner s dilemma game in  @xcite .",
    "we now briefly comment on the relationship between our numerical results and well known theoretical results on stag - hunt games .",
    "these theoretical models are based on ergodic stochastic processes in large populations and state that , when using best - response dynamics in random two - person encounters , and in the presence of a little amount of noise , both for well - mixed populations as well as for populations structured as rings , the risk - dominant strategy should take over the population in the long run  @xcite . from our simulation results on all kind of networks this is not the case ; in other words , at the steady state there is always either a single strategy , but not necessarily the risk - dominant one , or a mix of both strategies . for scale - free and random graphs , the numerical results of  @xcite agree with ours .",
    "the case of social networks , presented here for the first time , also confirms the above and in addition makes explicit the role played by communities .",
    "we may also mention at this point that , for the stag - hunt , the presence of a local interaction structure provided by a network has been shown to increase the region of the phase space in which the pareto - dominant outcome prevails for other strategy update rules , such as imitate the most successful neighbor or reproduce proportionally to fitness ( replicator dynamics )  @xcite .",
    "thus coordination is sensitive to the exact type of underlying dynamics in networks .",
    "this is indirectly confirmed by the theoretical study of robson and vega - redondo  @xcite in which a different matching model is used with respect to kandori et al  @xcite . in  @xcite players",
    "are immediately randomly rematched after each encounter and the result is that the pareto - dominant equilibrium is selected instead .",
    "+ in summary , it can be said that network effects tend to reinforce cooperation on the pareto - dominant case , which is a socially appreciable effect .",
    "however , these results must be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "we are numerically studying finite , network - structured populations during a limited amount of time , while theoretical results have been established for large well mixed populations in the very long run .",
    "the conditions are thus sufficiently different to conclude that numerical results and theoretical predictions based on different assumptions do not have to agree necessarily .",
    "in this work we have studied pure and general coordination games on complex networks by numerical simulation .",
    "situations described by coordination games are common in society and it is important to understand when and how coordination on socially efficient outcomes can be achieved . + in the case of pure coordination games on model networks using deterministic best response strategy dynamics we have found that network effects are small or non - existent in standard complex networks . on model social networks and a real co - authorship network the behavior is similar , but the transition from one convention to the other is smoother and the cluster structure of the networks plays an important role in protecting payoff - weaker conventions within communities and this leads to a clear polarization of conventions in the network . when a small amount of noise is added in order to simulate errors and trembles in the agent s decisions , the dynamics leads to the payoff - dominant norm for smaller values of the payoff difference between strategies .",
    "however , in the case of social networks , even a tiny amount of payoff advantage is enough to drive a minority of @xmath8-strategists to take over the whole network thanks to the cluster structure and mutations .",
    "+ in the case of general coordination games of the stug hunt type where there is a tension between payoff - dominance and risk - dominance , we have confirmed previous simulation results in the sense that , with deterministic best response dynamics the influence of network structure is very limited  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider model and social networks , again their community structure plays an important role which consists in allowing the existence at steady state of dimorphic populations in which both strategies are present and stable .",
    "the payoff - dominant strategy is favored in regions where risk - dominance should be the only stable strategy and , conversely , it allows risk - dominant players to survive in clusters when payoff - dominance should prevail .",
    "+ we have also compared numerical results with theoretical ones when they exist .",
    "the latter actually depend on the detailed structure of the stochastic processes generated by the particular theoretical model . in this sense ,",
    "numerical results are compatible with theoretical predictions when they are applicable , i.e. for well mixed and ring - structured populations  @xcite . also , for pure coordination games the predictions of  @xcite in arbitrary non - homogeneous structures are qualitatively confirmed .",
    "however , finite - size and complex network effects are difficult to describe theoretically and thus our results on complex and social networks can not always be easily compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "our current and future work is to investigate coordination games in a more realistic co - evolutionary scenario in which both the agents strategies as well as their interactions may vary dynamically .",
