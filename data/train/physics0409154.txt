    "we would like to show in our paper how sometimes very usual things taken from our daily live can be formulated into an elegant physical problem .",
    "let us carry out a simple experiment .",
    "we take an ordinary pen by one of its ends while keeping the other in touch with our finger as it is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] . at first , we allow for a large enough initial angle between the long axis of the pen and the vertical , say @xmath0 .",
    "we let the pen fall down . due to the contact with the finger , however , it is not a free fall .",
    "while falling down the pen slides across the finger and this makes it to rotate .",
    "finally , it fell on one side from the finger ( for large initial angles , it is a side where the center of mass of the pen was located initially ) .",
    "if then we decrease gradually the initial angle and repeat the experiment again , at a certain angle we notice that the center of mass of the pen starts to pass through the point of the `` pen - finger '' contact and the pen falls down on the other side from the finger .",
    "the question is : what is the critical value of the initial inclination angle in the considered setup which does separate the two different types of motion of the pen in our experiment ?",
    "first , let us understand upon what this critical angle , @xmath1 , could depend ?",
    "after some trials we can see that it depends on the initial position of the contact point between the pen and the finger .",
    "more precisely , being dimensionless , the critical angle depends on the ratio of the initial distance between the center of mass of the pen and the contact point to its total length , @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , this ratio together with the coefficient of kinetic friction , @xmath3 , between the pen and the finger , which is also dimensionless , are the only parameters which determine the critical angle ( we will consider a pen and a finger of zero thickness which is close to realistic conditions and simplifies essentially the problem ) .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to see that we can not construct any other dimensionless parameter in our problem , for example , from the mass of the pen or the gravitational constant , which means that the critical angle does not depend upon them .",
    "we would like to determine the critical angle for all values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "however , this proves to be rather a hard task .",
    "we will solve it only numerically .",
    "two limits are of particular interest in this problem that correspond to the case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to test our intuition and to try to guess the value of the critical angle in these limits .",
    "is it @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively or not ?",
    "we will try to exploit both of these cases analytically .",
    "differential equations which describe the evolution of the solid body momentum , @xmath9 , and angular momentum , @xmath10 , can be written in the general form @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total external force applied to the body and @xmath13 is the total torque .",
    "there are two independent variables in our problem : the angle @xmath14 and the length @xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : init ] .",
    "however , the normal force , @xmath16 , which acts on the pen at the pen - finger contact point and which is perpendicular to the pen long axis will also enter our equations of motion .",
    "so we will need three equations in total to describe the dynamics of the pen .",
    "it is convenient to derive two of these equations from the angular momentum evolution equation written with respect to two different axes .",
    "first , we write this equation with respect to the axis passing through the center of mass of the pen perpendicular to the plane of fig . [",
    "fig : init ] ( in order to exclude the weight force from consideration ) : @xmath17= n(t)l(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the proper moment of inertia of the pen , @xmath19 its angular velocity , @xmath20 the absolute value of the normal force , @xmath21 the lever of this force .",
    "the dependence on time for quantities we indicate by the parentheses on the right with the time variable , @xmath22 , inside .",
    "now , we consider the evolution of the angular momentum defined with respect to the axis passing through the contact point @xmath23 perpendicular to the plane of fig . [",
    "fig : init ] ( we exclude the normal force from the equation in this case ) : @xmath24      = m g \\ , l(t ) \\sin \\alpha(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the mass of the pen , @xmath26 the gravitational constant .    the last equation we will obtain from the evolution equation for the total momentum of the pen . for this purpose",
    "we choose the frame of reference which rotates together with the pen , contact point @xmath23 being in its origin . in this frame of reference",
    "the center of mass moves along one of two coordinate axes which coincides with the pen s long axis .",
    "since this frame of reference is not inertial we should take into account the centrifugal force acting on the pen as well . finally , we have : @xmath27 = m l(t)\\,\\omega^2 ( t )      - m g \\cos \\alpha(t ) + f_{\\text{fr}}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the velocity of the center of mass along the pen s long axis , @xmath29 the friction force .",
    "we will now simplify the above equations .",
    "first , we transform eq .",
    "( [ ang - mom - contact ] ) to obtain : @xmath30.\\ ] ] then , we find from eq .",
    "( [ ang - mom - center ] ) the normal force : @xmath31 and insert it in eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) which takes now the form : @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that by definition @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ omega - deriv ] ) and ( [ long - velocity ] ) and we obtain the system of two coupled nonlinear second order differential equations which describes the evolution of the angle and the center of mass position in time : @xmath35 here we have made all quantities dimensionless upon the substitutions : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we use a prime instead of @xmath39 from now on in our formulas in order to make them more compact .",
    "we require that the solution of this system would satisfy four initial conditions : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the last two conditions correspond to the zero initial velocity of the pen .    to find a solution of the above system is not a simple task .",
    "one way consists in employing numerical methods . in the next section",
    "we will show results which gives this approach .",
    "after that we will consider two cases when the system can be simplified and investigated analytically .    in appendix [ alt - way ]",
    "we give an alternative way of derivation of the above system of equations specifically for those vigilant readers who could feel themselves uncertain about the rotating frame of reference .",
    "in order to solve numerically the system of eqs .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) we first come back to variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 and we rewrite it as a system of four first order differential equations with four independent variables : @xmath14 , @xmath44 , @xmath15 and @xmath46",
    ". then , we use the finite difference method , namely euler s method , to solve it . for this",
    "we divide the time interval @xmath47 $ ] into @xmath48 small intervals , each of a length @xmath49 , and substitute , e.g. , the derivative @xmath50 by the ratio @xmath51/\\delta t$ ] , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "so , starting from @xmath54 we have at each step : @xmath55\\!\\!,{\\nonumber}\\\\      \\alpha_{i+1 } & = \\alpha_{i } + \\delta t\\ , \\omega_{i } , { \\nonumber}\\\\      l_{i+1 } & = l_{i } + \\delta t\\ , v_{i}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        surprisingly , this simple numerical scheme turns out to be stable and works very well .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : traject ] the results of our calculation for the trajectories of the pen s center of mass for three different initial positions .",
    "we use the value of the proper moment of inertia for a homogeneous stick @xmath56 .",
    "we note a complex behavior of the pen when its center of mass passes through the contact point twice . in two other cases",
    "the pen falls explicitly on different sides from the finger .    in order to determine the critical angle we simulate the fall of the pen for a given initial length @xmath4 .",
    "first , we take the initial angle @xmath57 , to be equal to @xmath58 and calculate the trajectory of the pen .",
    "if the pen fell on the left side from the finger ( we just look at the position of its center of mass at a height @xmath59 ) we subtract from @xmath57 its half and repeat the calculation . otherwise , if the pen fell on the opposite side , we add to the critical angle the half of it .",
    "we repeat the cycle about ten times increasing or decreasing the initial angle at each step by a half of an increment from a previous step .",
    "this procedure allows to achieve a very good precision of the critical angle value of about @xmath60 .",
    "the above method lies in the class of dichotomy methods .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] the calculated critical angle values for the whole range of the initial length @xmath4 .",
    "we have carried out the calculation for three values of the coefficient of kinetic friction @xmath3 . in the case of non zero value of the coefficient",
    "we see that @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath62 when @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no sliding for the angles @xmath63 , when the friction is available , which follows from the couple of equations at equilibrium : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , when @xmath66 the pen first rotates without sliding , its center of mass falls below the finger and then ( when @xmath67 ) it starts to slide .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath68 the pen starts to slide from the very beginning . the numerical result for @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , agree well with the critical angle value @xmath69 .    , b ) @xmath70 , and c ) @xmath71 .",
    "line d ) corresponds to the analytical solution in the case of critical angles close to @xmath7.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    a peculiar feature of the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath4 is its finite value for @xmath72 , i.e. when initially the pen touches the finger by its very end .",
    "this angle is about @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "we consider now two cases when the system of equations ( [ alpha2 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) , which describes the evolution of the inclination angle and the center of mass position of the pen in time , can be substantially simplified .",
    "it should be clear that the critical angle will be about @xmath7 when @xmath4 is close to zero . in the limit @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , eqs .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) simplify to the system ( we consider only the case @xmath74 ) : @xmath78 we have supposed the derivatives @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be negligibly small compared to unity as well .",
    "the solution of this system is a combination of trigonometric and hyperbolic sines and cosines .",
    "however , due to the zero initial condition for the velocity the sines drop out of the solution .",
    "thus , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants and @xmath84 .",
    "we suppose that the critical trajectory corresponds to the case when @xmath85 and @xmath86 for a particular moment @xmath87 .",
    "this could probably contradict the observation that the center of mass can pass twice through the contact point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : traject ] ) .",
    "however , we can hope that our assumption is valid at least for the limit @xmath88 .",
    "it results in @xmath89 and the oscillatory solution for @xmath90 and @xmath15 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , which is exactly the condition we searched for . finally , the critical angle in the considered limit equals to @xmath93 .",
    "we trace this dependence of @xmath61 upon @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] .",
    "the agreement between our theoretical result and numerical data for angles @xmath61 close to @xmath7 is quite remarkable .",
    "another limit of interest corresponds to small angles @xmath14 .",
    "the principal question is whether it is possible to prove analytically that for @xmath72 the critical angle @xmath61 has a finite non - zero value .",
    "so , we consider small angles @xmath94 and @xmath4 close to @xmath95 and we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) in this limit as : @xmath96 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ l2-small - angl ] ) is @xmath97 which corresponds to a free fall of the center of mass . in eq .",
    "( [ alpha2-small - angl ] ) we switch from the time variable , @xmath22 , to the length variable , @xmath15 , arriving at the equation : @xmath98      \\frac{d \\alpha}{d l }      -\\frac{l\\alpha}{2(l^2+i_{0})(l_{0}-l ) } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are not able to fully solve this equation . however , if we consider only the very beginning of the movement , when @xmath99 , we need to keep only third and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - l - small - angl ] ) which simplifies it essentially : @xmath100 the solution of the above equation is @xmath101 which fulfills initial conditions @xmath102 and @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "in order for our approximation to be self - consistent we should have @xmath105 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "while the solution ( [ alpha - small - angl - sol ] ) is valid only for @xmath99 we assume it does not differ much from an exact solution even for @xmath15 close to zero .",
    "we can not prove this assumption analytically , though a numerical simulation of eq .",
    "( [ alpha2-small - angl ] ) supports it .",
    "thus , from the condition of self - consistency for @xmath106 we should have @xmath107 .",
    "this means that , in the case of @xmath72 , the angle @xmath14 is always small if @xmath108 ( we note that this limit is close to @xmath109 ) . for these small initial angles the center of mass of the pen will pass across the contact point with the finger .",
    "in contrast , for larger initial angles the pen will fall on the side where its center of mass was located initially .",
    "so , the critical angle is in between and it is larger than zero .",
    "we have proposed a simple experiment , which needs a pen and a finger all in all , and we have formulated it into a mathematical problem . the key question of the problem is the value of the critical angle which separates two different types of trajectories of the falling pen .",
    "numerical methods allow to solve this problem and to find critical angles for any initial center of mass position @xmath4 .",
    "theoretical analysis of the equations provides us the critical angle value in the limit of small @xmath4 and allows us to say that for @xmath4 close to @xmath95 the critical angle should have a finite non - zero value .",
    "we would like to refer the reader to several problems which are also about the dynamics of the falling pen , however , in a totally different setup .",
    "@xcite we have encountered them while studying our problem .",
    "they are quite nice !",
    "we would like to thank maxim kirillov for discussions of a numerical solution , florian marquardt for remarks on the manuscript and many other people for their interest to the problem .",
    "we keep the equation which describes the evolution of the angular momentum in the center of mass frame of reference : @xmath110= n(t)l(t).\\ ] ] it permits to express the normal force through @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath111 ."
