    "understanding the effects of electron correlations is important not only for comprehending the behavior of a wide class of materials .",
    "it also allows one to get to fundamental principles of quantum theory .",
    "quantum dynamical effects caused by electron correlations are still in the center of interest of condensed - matter physicists .",
    "although a lot of aspects of electron correlations have been successfully explained , there are phenomena the picture of which is incomplete or lacks substantial pieces .",
    "the main obstacle in reaching a complete knowledge of the effects of electron correlations is the difficulty of a reliable description of dynamical many - body phenomena .",
    "the major effort in grasping strong electron correlations is focused on single - impurity anderson model ( siam).@xcite this model was conceived to provide a simple picture of formation of local magnetic moments .",
    "it appeared rather soon that formation of local moments is connected with the kondo effect.@xcite since then siam has been attracting standing attention of condensed - matter theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the first wave of interest in siam was crowned by finding an exact ground state of the model with a flat band of conduction electrons for all interaction strengths.@xcite the kondo effect in siam was then explained and quantitatively described .",
    "the exact expression for the kondo asymptotics in siam has become a hallmark and reference for dynamical effects of strong electron correlations .",
    "impurity models suit for a description of quantum dots and nano - particles@xcite but are unable to describe bulk , macroscopic effects of electron correlations .",
    "it is , however , generally believed that a local electron interaction in the tight - binding scheme offers enough space for the description of most of the dynamical effects of electron correlations .",
    "success of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of electron correlations has proved this.@xcite dynamical mean - field approach , that is local dynamical approximations , renewed interest in siam , since the basic ingredient of dmft is an impurity solver .",
    "the latter essentially is an impurity model with a self - consistent condition on the local one - electron propagators .",
    "the exact thermodynamic solution of siam , however , can not be used , since it does not produce the necessary dynamical renormalization of the energy spectrum . a new wave of attempts to find approximate dynamical solutions of siam in the strong - coupling regime arose",
    ".    presently , the most comprehensive quantitative approaches producing dynamical properties of the impurity models are quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite with its continuous - time extension,@xcite exact diagonalization ( ed ) with a discretized bath,@xcite and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite the first two approaches aim at a precise thermodynamics of the impurity problem , while the last one best reproduces low - temperature and low - energy scales of impurity models .",
    "the first two approaches work naturally in the matsubara formalism and need a numerical analytic continuation to determine spectral properties , while nrg can be straightforwardly extended to dynamical and spectral quantities.@xcite the numerical renormalization group represents now - a - days the most accurate quantitative low - temperature and low - energy dynamical solution of impurity problems.@xcite    apart from pure numerical methods a series of analytically controlled approximations have been proposed .",
    "an approximation based on low - frequency renormalizations of fermi - liquid parameters is able to reproduce the kondo scale in siam and fits for heavy fermion systems.@xcite it is not , however , suitable for the description of critical instabilities of the fermi liquid state .",
    "strong - coupling expansions based on the infinite - interaction model @xcite reproduce as well the kondo scale but fail to reproduce the fermi liquid regime in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "standard truncated weak - coupling expansions fail to reproduce correctly the strong - coupling regime .",
    "an improvement can be reached if the expansion is applied on vertex functions .",
    "expansions for two - particle vertices are mostly based on multiple scatterings of electrons on electrons ( t - matrix , tma ) or electrons on holes ( random phase , rpa ) .",
    "the non - renormalized multiple electron - hole scatterings lead to an unphysical pole that must be removed by a self - consistent treatment .",
    "standardly introduced one - electron self - consistency ( fluctuation - exchange approximation ) removes the pole but fails to reproduce the kondo scale.@xcite a static one - electron self - consistency of the hartree type was introduced in an effective approximate scheme , called local - moment approach.@xcite the expansion for the polarization operator ( rpa vertex ) uses one - electron propagators with a broken spin symmetry in this approximation .",
    "the spin symmetry of the equilibrium thermodynamic state is then recovered via a construction of the self - energy calculated from the polarization operator . in this way",
    "the rpa pole is not crossed and the strong - coupling limit keeps the polarization operator in the critical region of the rpa pole .",
    "the spectral function displays the correct kondo asymptotics of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "this theory , however , contains an artificial symmetry breaking and an auxiliary fitting parameter , the length of the local magnetic moment , in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "an alternative way of introducing a self - consistency at the two - particle level was proposed by us.@xcite we suggested to use parquet equations constructed from multiple electron - electron and electron - hole scatterings and use the criticality of the rpa pole for a simplification leading to a manageable theory .",
    "this approximation allows us to control analytically the rpa pole and the genesis of the kondo asymptotics .",
    "the derived kondo behavior reproduces universal features of the exact bethe - ansatz solution .",
    "real materials are more complex and can not be described by elementary impurity models .",
    "one has to extend the methods to multi - orbital hamiltonians .",
    "not all the methods used as impurity solvers for single - orbital models work also in the multi - orbital case .",
    "the exact solution can be extended to @xmath2 models only in the limit @xmath3.@xcite there are natural extensions of qmc@xcite , ed,@xcite and nrg@xcite methods to multiple - orbitals .",
    "all the numerically exact approaches are , however , computationally rather expensive for realistic atomic structures .",
    "there is hence still a need for simpler , computationally less expensive semi - analytic approaches that could qualitatively correctly describe the transition from the weak to the strong coupling regimes in multi - orbital impurity and lattice models .",
    "some of the existing analytically controlled approaches to strong electron correlations have recently been extended to multi - orbital models , mostly @xmath2 anderson models .",
    "various spectral and thermodynamic quantities have recently been calculated within the renormalized fermi - liquid expansion,@xcite fluctuation exchange,@xcite or local - moment approach.@xcite the aim of this paper is to present a generalization of a two - particle approach based on simplified parquet equations to multi - orbital models and create a full - scale impurity solver for realistic models of correlated electrons . unlike the most of the other multi - orbital approaches , we formulate the method so that it can directly be applied not only to impurity models but also to lattice models within the dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "the approximation is formulated in real frequencies and hence the spectral properties are directly available .",
    "the low and high frequency behavior of the one - electron spectral function , its three - peak structure , is qualitatively well reproduced and the method allows one to control analytically the critical behavior of bethe - salpeter equations for the two - particle vertex .",

    "we use these elementary scattering processes to construct the full two - particle vertex @xmath19 from a two - particle perturbation expansion .",
    "once we have this vertex we construct the one - electron self - energy as the fundamental quantity from which we derive all thermodynamic properties .",

    "we discussed earlier that the latter option is more appropriate in the strong - coupling regime , since we can better control the two - particle singularity in the electron - hole correlation function and consequently both low and high energy scales are qualitatively better reproduced than in approximate schemes with the fully renormalized propagators.@xcite     with vertex @xmath19 .",
    "the first and the second term on the right - hand side of this equation are the hartree and the fock contribution.,width=8 ]",

    "we hence start with simple approximations on vertex @xmath19 .",
    "we resort our analysis only to local approximations , that is , we stay within the dynamical mean - field theory with only local fluctuations and matsubara frequencies , orbital index and spin as dynamical variables .",
    "we will treat these degrees of freedom separately .",
    "the simplest approximations for vertex @xmath19 , beyond the bare interaction , are multiple scatterings of the same form as defined by elementary processes from the preceding section .",

    "we do not take into account the third channel with triplet polarization bubbles .",

    "such an approximation is known to be unreliable in the strong - coupling regime.@xcite    intermediate electron coupling is marked by proximity of a pole in the electron - hole vertex @xmath37 .",

    "this pole is unphysical and indicates that the perturbation expansion for @xmath44 must be renormalized .",
    "the critical interaction @xmath45 from rpa defines an upper limit on the weak - coupling regime where perturbation theory with selected classes of generic diagrams can safely be applied .",
    "we speak about strong coupling if @xmath46 , where only self - consistent approximations may be reliable .",
    "one , and most often used option how to suppress the unphysical pole , or better to shift it to infinite interaction strength is to employ one - particle dynamical self - consistency .",

    "this one - particle self - consistency succeeds in shifting the unphysical pole to infinity , but the kondo regime defined as @xmath47 is not properly reproduced .",
    "moreover , flex - type approximations completely smear out the large - frequency structures .",
    "there are no satellite hubbard bands.@xcite    a better systematic alternative how to move the rpa critical interaction @xmath45 to infinity is to introduce a two - particle self - consistency",
    ". the most straightforward way to do so is to use the parquet approach .",
    "its basic idea is to replace the bare interaction in bethe - salpeter equations and by irreducible vertex functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . in the exact theory then @xmath50 = \\psi\\left[\\lambda^{ee}\\right ] = \\gamma$ ] and equation   transforms to @xmath51 .",
    "when we combine the two bethe - salpeter equations with the parquet equation   modified as above we obtain a set of non - linear integral equations for the irreducible vertices @xmath52 , \\lambda^{ee}\\left[u , g\\right]$ ] and finally also for the full vertex @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "it is , however , impossible to solve the parquet equations in the strong - coupling regime with a vanishing kondo scale @xmath47 .",
    "the problem lies in that all the vertex functions , solutions of the full parquet equations , generally depend on three frequencies and there is presently no method , either analytic or numerical , that would predict the full analytic structure of the two - particle vertices .",
    "we hence have to approximate the full parquet equations .",
    "we proposed a simplification of the parquet equations in the kondo regime of the single - impurity anderson model.@xcite this simplification utilizes a partial separation of large and small frequency fluctuations in the kondo regime when the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - hole channel is almost singular . in the non - renormalized perturbation expansion",
    "it is the rpa pole .",
    "the principal idea of our simplification is that we separate large fluctuations diverging at the critical point from those remaining finite . in this way",
    "we describe correctly universal quantities connected with the critical point in the electron - hole bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we neglect all finite fluctuations and keep only the relevant ones diverging at the critical point .",
    "we then replace all finite frequency - dependent functions by constants and keep only the frequency dependence in the variables controlling large fluctuations .",
    "this simplification is kind of a mean - field ( simplest ) approximation for the dynamics in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we know from the analysis of multiple electron - electron and electron - hole scatterings that only the latter can cause a singularity in the vertex function .",
    "it means that the irreducible vertex in the electron - hole channel @xmath48 remains finite .",
    "we hence can replace it by an effective interaction that we denote @xmath54 .",
    "the renormalized bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - hole channel is rpa - like with the following replacement @xmath55 the effective interaction @xmath54 will be determined from the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - electron channel by using the parquet self - consistency . within the scope of our approximation the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - electron scattering channel holds only in an averaged form smearing out finite frequency differences .",
    "we proposed in ref .   a decoupling of the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - electron scattering channel so that an integral equation is converted to an algebraic , solvable one .",
    "in this approximate simplification an averaged integral kernel is assumed to diagonalize the integral equation .",

    "the dominant contribution to the integral kernel in the electron - electron scattering channel comes from the singular part of the vertex from the electron - hole scattering channel , being @xmath61 . since the averaged integral kernels @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on a fermionic matsubara frequency",
    ", we assume that eqs .  , are valid only for the lowest frequency , being zero at zero temperature . at finite temperatures we use the lowest or a few low frequencies , symmetric around zero , and",
    "add all equations for these frequencies . the effective interaction",
    "is then determined form an average over eq .   and eq .   for a few lowest - lying fermionic frequencies",
    "the low - temperature asymptotics is in this way well reproduced .",
    "the higher the temperature the more matsubara frequencies we must take into account to maintain accuracy of the zero - temperature solution .",
