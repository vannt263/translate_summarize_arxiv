    "jets are ubiquitous in the universe . while their formation mechanisms are still unclear , the required components appear to be a magnetic field , rotation , and accretion . in the case of black holes ( bhs ) , the accretion is usually expected to take the form of a keplerian disc with an angular momentum axis defined by the rotation of the disc material .",
    "the angular momentum of the source of disc matter , however , is capable of being arbitrarily misaligned with respect to the bh spin axis .",
    "because bh jets are so prevalent , either the initial rotation of the matter is not important to jet formation , or the matter is torqued in some way to align with the angular momentum vector of the black hole .",
    "the gravitational potential of a rotating black hole is not spherically symmetric , so a different orientation of the disc could also have a significant effect on emergent radiation , affecting bh spin measurements @xcite , jet orientation @xcite , and timing features in light curves @xcite .",
    "hence , determining whether ( and to what degree ) discs align by the action of bh spin is important .",
    "there are a few processes through which material is torqued : 1 ) the exchange of angular momentum between neighbouring rings of material , a process called the accretion torque ; 2 ) the lense - thirring effect , which is due to the dragging of spacetime by a rotating black hole combined with viscous forces @xcite ; and 3 ) a @xcite ( hereafter bz ) jet that is aligned with the rotation of the black hole near the black hole , but misaligned at larger radii by it trying to push on a misaligned disc @xcite .",
    "a study into magnetic alignment , corresponding to the third process , was performed by ( hereafter kl , see also @xcite ) , who concluded that either the inflow timescale was shorter than the alignment timescale , or the accretion rate was so low that the source could not be observed in the first place .",
    "their negative result hinged on the assumptions that 1 ) the maximum magnetic field strength was limited by weak turbulent eddies in the disc ; 2 ) the disc is rather small in radial extent with a relatively short inflow time ; and 3 ) the disc followed the shakura - sunyaev density profile generalised by @xcite ( hereafter nt ) .",
    "since kl s study on magnetic alignment , several disc models have been proposed , such as geometrically thick radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) as the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model @xcite .",
    "the adaf model has a steeper density profile than the nt solution , so a bh jet can more easily torque material at larger radii",
    ". the nature of the magnetic field can also be quite different , such as in the magnetically arrested disc ( mad ) model @xcite .",
    "in the mad model , the magnetic field builds up near the black hole , until the magnetic tension is high enough that it balances inward forces due to the massive accretion flow .",
    "the magnetic field strengths attained are higher than previously considered , which means that magnetic alignment may yet actually be an efficient method of aligning the disc .",
    "lastly , astrophysical discs can extend to tens of thousands of gravitational radii , where the inflow time becomes quite long and allows for the bz jet torque to cumulate .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how a disc aligns due to the lense - thirring and bz jet torques by computing the disc shape from angular momentum conservation .",
    "we will demonstrate that disc alignment can occur for a variety of accretion rates , bh masses , and magnetic field strengths .",
    "in section [ sec : method ] we will describe the equations we use to compare the different processes . in section [ sec : discsystems ]",
    "we will discuss the different accretion systems and disc models we will use . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we will show the alignment of the different disc models and for a variety of systems such as sgr  a@xmath0 and grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "in section [ sec : discussion ] we will discuss the results , and in section [ sec : conclude ] we will present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will obtain our equations of motion , give a description of the different scalings , and derive the external torques .",
    "we start with the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) equations of motion , given by energy - momentum conservation : @xmath1 for an ideal stress - energy tensor @xmath2 ( given in terms of a coordinate basis ) , where we assume the induction equation controls the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "the source term @xmath3 includes any disc cooling or external torques on the gas .",
    "after the usual height - integration and sticking to an orthonormal vector basis , one obtains for the @xmath4 equation of motion : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the accretion torque per unit area that includes all magnetic and viscous terms that drive accretion and angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "the height - integrated angular momentum per unit area is given by @xmath8 , so that one can write the @xmath4 equation of motion as just @xmath9 the equation in vector form for all components that is valid in the small - angle approximation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total vector torque per unit area that includes the accretion torque and any other external torques ( i.e. lense - thirring , blandford - znajek jet , etc . ) .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows the general setup of our problem of a warped disc produced by torques that act to align an outer disc that is misaligned with respect to the bh spin axis .",
    "we assume the external torques all act to re - align the disc and do not cause twisting , precession , or breaking .",
    "so , the angular momentum vector of the disc reorients towards the bh spin axis without any twist . then , there are only two angular momentum components to consider and so only two equations of motion to consider ( i.e. the vector parallel to the bh spin axis and that perpendicular to the spin axis ) .",
    "we assume small misalignments , so that the vector component for the misaligned angular momentum of @xmath12 is the required lowest - order term , meaning any dependence upon @xmath13 within the full tilted disc solution for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 can be neglected as being a higher - order correction . here",
    "@xmath13 is the angle away from the equatorial plane , and toward the @xmath17 axis is positive @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , for the aligned angular momentum of @xmath18 , the perturbed disc solution would only be higher - order in @xmath13 and can be neglected for small tilts .",
    "this means that we can assume the radial profiles of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 correspond to the original ( e.g. ) nt , adaf , or untilted simulation profiles .",
    "this is why we do not have to consider the rest - mass or energy equations of motion .",
    "the assumption of small tilt angles also means the radial direction and path length are approximately equal to the true disc direction and true disc path length , so we do not need to distinguish ( say ) @xmath19 from @xmath20 , which would be the actual vector position of the disc .",
    "this means @xmath15 is a sufficiently accurate velocity along the disc path .",
    "we calculate the magnitude of the angular momentum per unit area @xmath21 at some outer radius @xmath22 at angle @xmath23 and decompose it into an aligned component @xmath24 , parallel to the spin vector of the black hole , and a misaligned component @xmath25 , pointing perpendicular to this direction .",
    "so , we have starting values @xmath26 at an outer radius @xmath22 and outer disc position angle @xmath23 , where the starting values use @xmath27 from the untilted disc model .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ vectau ] ) to decompose the angular momenta into parallel and perpendicular components , giving : @xmath28    we solve these torque equations discretely for new values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( giving @xmath13 ) for a radial step size @xmath31 , while the new disc angle @xmath32 is obtained from the difference in positions of the disc :    rcl r_n+1 & = & r_n + r , + _ n+1 & = & ( -l_/ l _ ) , + _ , n+1 & = & , [ thetanp1 ]    which after the first step no longer requires information from the untilted disc model for @xmath14 or @xmath33  only @xmath15 is still required .",
    "in our small - angle approximation , the parallel torque equation just becomes an equation that ensures the accretion torque drives the correct behavior for the total angular momentum .",
    "the perpendicular torque equation contains all information about the actual angle , so in principle it can be solved for @xmath13 directly by plugging in the approximation that latexmath:[$\\tilde{l}_{\\perp } \\approx    disc model value of @xmath27 .",
    "we choose a slightly different but same - order accuracy approach , by evolving @xmath29 and @xmath30 independently from each torque equation to obtain @xmath13 as in eq .",
    "( [ thetanp1 ] ) .",
    "this results in a total @xmath21 not identical with the untilted disc model value , but that is consistent with our small - angle approximation and the higher - order error becomes negligible for small @xmath13 .",
    "we use at least ten steps per decade in radius , and to ensure accuracy we half the step size if the change in @xmath13 for any step is more than @xmath35 .",
    "we also check that our choice of initial angle leads to an @xmath21 similar to the untilted disc model value as must be true if we have chosen a sufficiently small angle so our approximations are valid .      because we have systems with a wide range of masses",
    ", we will use the mass of the black hole in solar masses ( @xmath36 ) as our mass scale , the corresponding gravitational radius as our length scale ( @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ) , and the light crossing time as our time scale ( @xmath39 ) , with @xmath40 the gravitational constant , and @xmath41 the speed of light .",
    "we denote with a bar every variable that follows this scaling ( @xmath42 ) , and use small letters , or a different symbol for every variable that has an alternate scaling ( i.e. total angular momentum of the bh as @xmath43 that is the dimensionless bh spin , and magnetic flux @xmath44 as the dimensionless magnetic flux ) .",
    "we scale the accretion rate to the eddington accretion rate for a one solar mass black hole , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the accretion rate at the horizon , @xmath47 allowing for a wind if @xmath48 , and where @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of a proton , @xmath51 is the arbitrarily - chosen nominal accretion efficiency of @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the thomson cross section .",
    "we normalise the spin to the mass of the black hole , @xmath54 .",
    "the dimensionless surface density is given by : @xmath55 and the dimensionless torque per unit area is :    rcl | & = & m = 1.22 10 ^ -44 m .",
    "the dragging of spacetime by a rotating black hole aligns material via the lense - thirring ( lt ) effect @xcite .",
    "the lt effect inevitably leads to precession of the disc , but neighbouring rings can exchange angular momentum through viscosity , allowing alignment of the disc .",
    "although this effect is only efficient very close to the black hole , the torque can also propagate outward via viscous forces , a process known as the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite , which is commonly invoked as a method to align accretion discs with the spin of the black hole .",
    "we assume the lt torque does not cause substantial twisting , so that twist angles are much smaller than the assumed small tilt angles .",
    "we also assume the disc does not break , as can occur for large tilt angles @xcite .",
    "lastly , we assume the disc does not precess , but we check our solutions for when precession is likely to occur ( i.e. @xmath56 for viscosity parameter @xmath57 and height - to - radius ratio of @xmath58 ) . in such cases when lt dominates alignment and @xmath59 , we check if the bz jet torque would have led to alignment anyway without the lt torque .",
    "we neglect apsidal precession , which could lead to additional effects .",
    "the lt precession torque is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 describes the frame - dragging . for a general disc model ,",
    "we assume a scaled keplerian motion , so that the rotational velocity per unit speed of light is given by @xmath62 so the dimensionless form of the lt torque is given by @xmath63    nominally some viscous process acts to redistribute the precession torque that could cause alignment in some cases .",
    "we assume the lt precession torque is re - directed by viscous interaction between differential precession as to maximally align the disc .",
    "this means that the lt torque magnitude is taken as the precession torque , but the direction is taken as that which maximally aligns the disc : @xmath64 this is generally not the case , but the final solution does not depend upon the lt torque direction being exactly along the perpendicular direction , and instead it could have been oriented perpendicular to the accretion torque or oriented along the disc like the electromagnetic torque .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath13 , these all give the same resulting torque and behavior for @xmath21 .",
    "our goal is to conservatively estimate whether the competing bz jet torque can dominate any effect by lt . by choosing the maximal lt alignment effect",
    ", we give the lt torque the best chance to dominate the bz jet torque physics .",
    "if our results show this conservative choice still leads to the bz jet dominating the lt alignment , then our result of bz dominance is robust to any weaker lt effect .",
    "given the current significant uncertainty in how ( or whether ) the lt and other general relativistic effects lead to alignment , we take this simplifying approach in order to make restrictive statements about strength or physics involved in lt leading to alignment . if lt ends up causing less alignment , precession , or breaking , this only weakens the role of lt in aligning the disc and allows the bz jet to more generally dominate .",
    "if the electromagnetic ( em ) jet is aligned with the rotation of the black hole , it can push on one side of a misaligned disc @xcite . the torque described by kl",
    "was derived assuming vacuum conditions , so there is no spin - down or torque when the field is aligned with the black hole spin axis .",
    "however , @xcite showed that even if the field is aligned with the bh spin axis , the bh will release angular momentum .",
    "in general , any orientation of the magnetic field will produce torques in the surrounding disc when the jet satisfies the conditions for force - free or magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "a bz jet contains a constant magnetic flux and rotates at a constant field line rotation frequency along field lines ( and individual field lines rotate at similar frequencies to order unity ) . for small spins",
    ", the spin axis does not necessarily control the jet direction even near the bh , while for larger spins the jet direction near the bh is dominated by the spin axis @xcite .",
    "we assume the regime where the spin magnitude is large enough to have the jet aligned with the bh near the bh , although arbitrary angles applicable to small spins could be considered .",
    "the bz jet torque on the disc is due to the magnetic field draping the surface of the disc and pushing into the disc surface with a magnetic pressure .",
    "kl found that the torque along the azimuthal direction ( into the plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) vanishes , so there is no precessing torque .",
    "so the bz jet torque has components @xmath65 where kl found @xmath66",
    ". one could set @xmath67 and our results are not substantially changed .",
    "we obtain the net torque per unit area @xmath68 .",
    "the net force vanishes for zero tilt due to the jet pushing on the disc from above and below equally , while when the tilt is finite then the jet pushes down more on one side than the other .",
    "so @xmath69 as the field rotates , the field could lag in shape and not follow the disc surface , which could introduce order unity changes to our force difference @xmath70 .",
    "the one - sided force per unit area @xmath71 is due to the magnetic pressure @xmath72 of the jet pushing on the disc orthogonal to the disc surface .",
    "this gives that the net torque per unit area of the jet pushing down on the disc is @xmath73 which is consistent with kl s torque direction and magnitude in the limit they considered where @xmath67 .",
    "the magnetic pressure is @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 in gaussian units ) , @xmath76 is the magnetic field 4-vector , @xmath77 is the levi - civita tensor , @xmath78 is the 4-velocity , and @xmath79 is the electromagnetic tensor @xcite . in flat space - time ,",
    "@xmath80 . at large radii for a jet , @xmath81",
    ", because the field becomes toroidal and the velocity becomes radial , while at small radii @xmath82 with a small angular velocity dominating the radial velocity .",
    "so , @xmath83 is generally small compared to the other term .",
    "the lab - frame magnetic field s radial component @xmath84 is determined by the magnetic flux lines given by @xmath85 with radial magnetic field @xmath84 in gaussian units , and where @xmath86 with jet collimation parameter @xmath87 described by the field shape @xmath88,\\ ] ] which is some constant @xmath89 for a field line of interest that closely hugs the disc surface with @xmath90 .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 could be derived by pressure - matching the jet magnetic pressure with the disc gas pressure for a given disc model @xcite . in our case , we do not model the role of gas pressure , so the disc - jet interaction takes place as effectively having the magnetic field fill most of space for small tilt disc angles and small disc curvatures as if @xmath90 .",
    "we use a dimensionless magnetic flux passing through the bh horizon ( at @xmath92 , the horizon radius ) of @xmath93 / \\sqrt{4 \\pi r_{\\mathrm{g}}^2 \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{bh}}c}.\\ ] ] for force - free jets , the radial field is approximately related to the toroidal field by @xmath94 / c,\\ ] ] @xcite , for field line angular frequency of rotation @xmath95 , where the last approximation comes from the blandford - znajek split monopole valid at high @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "thick discs could restrict some energy outflow and lead to a more rapid change in power as a function of @xmath96 @xcite , but the total power output is the same at high @xmath96 .",
    "for an mhd jet , the behaviour of @xmath97 can be derived from energy conservation via the definition of @xmath98 that is the energy flux per unit rest - mass flux related to the conversion of electromagnetic to kinetic energy .",
    "this gives that @xmath99 so that for given foot point values ( @xmath100 / c$ ] , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 for our @xmath90 case ) , we need @xmath104 to determine @xmath105 @xcite",
    ". this mhd version of @xmath97 would not include any ram pressure or thermal pressure that would act to push the disc into alignment if the jet were aligned with the bh spin axis as it would be if the jet started as electromagnetic .",
    "the ram pressure is @xmath106 for conserved quantity @xmath107 . the magnetic pressure dropping faster than @xmath108 once mhd acceleration occurs is therefore compensated by the ram pressure that still goes as @xmath109 for @xmath110 with @xmath111 going from @xmath112 .",
    "so we generally use eq .",
    "( [ bphi ] ) for @xmath97 to account for the total jet torque .    for the lorentz factor s radial dependence",
    ", we use the results from analytical calculations and simulations @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the force - free lorentz factor , and @xmath98 is the total energy flux per unit mass flux ( and the upper limit of @xmath111 ) .",

    ", @xmath126 can be computed as if the field followed the shape of the disc , and then @xmath84 would be computed by how the local magnetic flux changes in @xmath13 . however , these effects are higher - order in tilt angle .",
    "if the mhd jet is more conical ( so has @xmath127 ) , the lorentz factor behaves qualitatively differently with a lorentz factor given by @xmath128 , replacing the second asymptotic by the solution to the cubic equation @xmath129^{1/3 } , \\label{gamma2m}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 for @xmath13 away from the equator , and @xmath133^{1/3}\\approx ( \\mu)^{1/3}$ ] @xcite . because in this paper we are interested in @xmath90 , we set @xmath134 .",
    "this forces the lorentz factor to grow logarithmically with radius .",
    "this gives reasonable values of lorentz factor as compared to grmhd simulations of discs and jets that have @xmath135 by @xmath136 @xcite , e.g. for @xmath137@xmath138 at @xmath136@xmath139 , this gives @xmath140@xmath141 .",
    "for the given definitions of the internal and external torques , the parallel and perpendicular torques can be written as    rcl _ & = & - _ ( _ ) + _ ( ) , + _ & = & _ + _ ( _ ) + _ ( ) ,    which are used in eq .",
    "( [ vectauperppar ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , to lowest - order in @xmath13 , the torque equation involving @xmath142 controls the evolution of @xmath143 and slight changes in direction of the lt or bz jet torque give the same result .",
    "in this section , we discuss the types of disc systems we consider .      for disc models not based upon simulations , we use that model s arguments for equipartition magnetic fields within the disc itself . to get the field on the bh that drives the jet , we assume the radial field strength in the disc is @xmath144 as expected when small - scale turbulent eddies of size @xmath145 in the disc set the scale of the radial field @xcite .",
    "this leads to a radial field much weaker for thin discs than if one assumed a dynamo existed that drove the toroidal field into a comparably strong poloidal field .",
    "grmhd simulations show that magnetic flux can build - up to a saturated value leading to the so - called magnetically - arrested disc ( mad ) .",

    "the flow is too tenuous to radiate efficiently and becomes a riaf .",

    "a@xmath0 , the inflow time is more rapid than in the standard thin disc case , but the disc still aligns by the bz jet torque by @xmath218 as consistent with grmhd simulations of tilted discs around rotating black holes @xcite .      in some cases",
    ", the lt torque can appear to dominate , but we have assumed a maximally aligning lt torque to test if the bz jet torque still dominates alignment .",
    "we can also check the case when the lt torque is weak ( e.g. , due to the lt torque instead leading to precession ) to see if the bz jet torque alone is sufficient to lead to substantial alignment .",
    "if so , then even in those regions dominated by the lt torque , the bz torque is sufficient regardless of the regime the lt torque operates in ( i.e. diffusive versus wave - like ) .",
    "we repeat the above analysis , but this time turn off the lt torque entirely . for the mad case , we find that the bz jet torque indeed leads to substantial alignment even in regions where the lt torque could dominate .",
    "for example , in the transition region between nt and slim disc regimes , the bz torque alone is sufficient to align material out to thousands of gravitational radii .",
    "this means that even if lt leads to precession once @xmath170 increases compared to @xmath57 as @xmath192 rises towards eddington , the bz torque can still align the disc out to large radii .",
    "so , the bz torque can align the disc before the lt torque would have a chance to cause precession .",
    "in some cases , the intermediate regime occurs , where the bz torque could lead to alignment , but at such radii the lt torque is already strong , in which case the disc could be partially precessing and partially aligning .",
    "the riaf model applies at very low or very high accretion rates . in our default model ,",
    "we select the simulation results as most accurately portraying this regime . here",
    "instead we consider the adaf model as our riaf model .",
    "we repeat the same analysis as for our default case , but consider how the riaf regime changes .    due to the steep density profile in the adaf case , we find that the jet rapidly aligns the disc out near the starting radius .",
    "this is because there is effectively much less angular momentum at large radii compared to the default model .",
    "the adaf case leads to most of the mass reaching the bh , leading to a maximally effective jet that can more readily affect the outer disc . in real discs , such as for sgr  a@xmath0 , one expects the disc to transition to the bondi inflow that itself will transition to the ambient medium outside the influence of the bh s gravitational potential ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the adaf riaf case is the only case where the results are also significantly affected by how we treat the jet as either force - free or mhd . in particular , we have only considered the electromagnetic contribution to any pressure by the jet on the disc . as electromagnetic energy",
    "is converted to kinetic energy in an mhd jet , the electromagnetic contribution drops as our mhd jet case describes .",
    "this leads to an ineffective electromagnetic pressure at large radii in the adaf riaf case .",
    "however , as described above , the total pressure is best modelled by the force - free case , so that the entire adaf aligns out to large radius .      here",
    "we consider the dependence on other model parameters , including the outer disc radius @xmath219 , total energy flux per unit rest - mass flux in the jet @xmath98 , dimensionless bh spin @xmath96 , rotation rate @xmath195 , wind mass loss power - law index @xmath187 , viscosity parameter @xmath57 , and magnetic collimation parameter @xmath91 . in each case , we repeat the analysis for new parameters .    for discs starting at smaller radii down to @xmath220 ,",
    "the lt torque plays a stronger role even for the riaf regime .",
    "this suggests that for small discs , like those that may be present during some deep penetrating tidal disruption events , the disc may tend to precess more than align .    for @xmath205 ( instead of our default @xmath221 ) or slightly higher values of @xmath222 ,",
    "the results are similar with the expected less effective magnetic pressure that scales as @xmath223 where @xmath224 at large radii . for smaller discs",
    "the change in @xmath98 leads to less dramatic effects because @xmath111 has not reached terminal values near @xmath98 .",
    "a smaller bh spin @xmath96 leads to a weaker jet as expected because the magnetic pressure roughly scales as @xmath225 .",
    "because the lt torque scales as only @xmath96 , this means eventually at small enough @xmath96 the lt torque dominates ( whether or not alignment occurs ) and the bz torque plays no role as expected .",
    "the rotation rate factor @xmath195 is typically fixed for each disc model type , but smaller values lead to weaker lt torques and allow the bz torque to more easily dominate and lead to alignment because the disc has less angular momentum for the same jet magnetic pressure ( that does not directly depend upon the disc rotation rate ) .",
    "mads tend to be more sub - keplerian , so the stronger field leads to a stronger jet that even more easily aligns the more slowly - rotating material .    the mass - loss - rate power - law index @xmath187 that enters @xmath226 allows a shallower density profile , which makes the inner jet less effective at aligning material present at fixed large radii .",
    "the simulation scalings used already effectively include a wind , and there is still aligning at least within the region near the bh .",
    "a smaller viscosity parameter of @xmath227 leads to a slower inflow rate , giving the lt torque or bz jet torque more time to align the material out to larger radii . in this case",
    ", the bz jet torque aligns the riaf simulation material out to @xmath228 instead of just @xmath218 .",
    "the nt region is aligned by lt torques out to @xmath229 instead of just @xmath136 .",
    "the magnetic collimation parameter @xmath91 is chosen as @xmath90 as we do not include the disc pressure matching to the jet pressure .",
    "disc vertical stratification and pressure can force @xmath230 @xcite , leading to a stronger magnetic pressure for any given radius .",
    "this would lead to a much stronger bz torque , however a compensating factor is that collimating jets also become causally disconnected from the disc and itself @xcite .",
    "the balance of these effects is left for future work .",
    "the lense - thirring torque has a steep dependence with radius , so it can more readily dominate the bz torque at small radii . at larger radii , the bz jet torque can readily dominate .",
    "if the bz torque leads to substantial alignment at large radii , then the lt torque has no chance to operate and can not align or lead to precession . whether alignment occurs depends upon the disc model : nt models tend to align by lt and other models tend to align by the bz jet torque .",
    "the bz torque depends on the magnetic flux , and since large scale magnetic fields can be more easily supported by thick discs @xcite , it is not surprising that for a thick disc these torques are more effective than for thin discs .",
    "for this reason in the thin novikov & thorne disc , the lense - thirring and accretion torque dominate , but for even higher accretion rates , which cause the disc to become thicker , the ( electro-)magnetic torque becomes more dominant .",
    "the lt torque depends on the density distribution , which can change its radial profile . in the case of the inner region of a novikov & thorne disc ,",
    "this dependency gives it a slope as flat as the accretion torque , making it the strongest throughout that region .",
    "when a density distribution with a negative radial dependence is used , the lense - thirring torque quickly becomes negligible , sometimes not even dominating at all .",
    "if most accretion happens at ( super-)eddington rates , the disc will be thick , and the bardeen - petterson effect will cause precession instead of alignment , also decreasing the importance of the lense - thirring torque .",
    "for these two reasons the bardeen - petterson effect can become negligible in these systems , a hypothesis supported by recent numerical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . as a result we may need to look to other torquing mechanisms to align the disc in astrophysical systems .",
    "the blandford - znajek torque estimates in this paper assume a simple monopolar field geometry ( @xmath90 ) , while collimating jets have a magnetic torque that drops off more slowly , and such geometries may be more effective than we have assumed . on the other hand , the jet can become ballistic before the blandford - znajek torque is completely effective .",
    "these effects need to be modelled with detailed simulations .",
    "we have included the equations for general values of @xmath91 in this paper .",
    "our approach to computing the disc shape and including the torques is quite simplified , but improves the one in .",
    "they compared the timescale of accretion to the timescale of magnetic alignment for a disc that is rigid over an extended range of radii . in our case ,",
    "the disc shape is computed by the inclusion of advection terms that account for the timescale of accretion versus alignment at each radius .",
    "we allow for stronger mad - strength magnetic fields , and we allow the disc to extend to physically reasonable larger radii where the timescale for inflow becomes long enough for the bz torque to become more effective .",
    "we have performed simple calculations of the disc shape due to aligning torques caused by the bh spin axis being different than the disc angular momentum axis .",
    "our approach is rougher in handling the lense - thirring torques than other analytical works @xcite , but no other work has considered the competing effects of lense - thirring and blandford - znajek jet torques .",
    "we treat the blandford - znajek torque fairly accurately .",
    "naturally , prior analytical work is also unable to treat the magnetic field within the disc accurately except as a viscosity .",
    "our calculation for the lense - thirring aligning torque is rough , but we chose the torque to be maximally aligning with the goal of testing whether the bz jet torque could still dominate alignment .",
    "any other missing physics that leads to precession , breaking , or oscillation by lense - thirring would only weaken its ability to align before the bz jet aligns the disc . in that sense , the calculation conservatively determines where the bz jet dominates alignment .",
    "we have also taken a simple approach because simulations are expensive and have yet to be self - consistent .",
    "that is , simulations have so - far been limited to using an effective viscosity instead of turbulent magnetic fields @xcite , tend to not resolve the mri and consider relatively thick discs in full gr @xcite , or approximate gr with relatively thick discs @xcite .",
    "we have also neglected apsidal precession , which could lead to additional external torques .",
    "while our calculations are rough , this has allowed us to scan a broader parameter space of possible disc models , black hole masses , accretion rates , and magnetic field types . and it has allowed us to consider the role of jet - induced alignment that otherwise requires expensive simulations @xcite .",
    "the simulations performed by @xcite show alignment results reasonably consistent with our calculations , with the riafs in the mad state effectively aligning near the bh .",
    "they estimated the bz jet torque analytically as an internal torque with @xmath231  which is only roughly a good approximation close to the black hole .",
    "we have considered the competition between lense - thirring and blandford - znajek jet torques in driving alignment between the disc angular momentum vector and bh spin vector .",
    "we have studied a broad parameter space of possible disc models , black hole masses , accretion rates , and magnetic field types in order to determine the disc shape , what radius alignment occurs , and which torque dominates the alignment process .    in those regions where bz jet alignment is effective at aligning the disc ,",
    "lense - thirring becomes unimportant and ineffective because the material is already aligned by the bz jet before lense - thirring operates .",
    "this also means that lense - thirring will be ineffective at other non - aligning processes like precession and disc breaking .    for bh x - ray binaries ,",
    "state transitions show a variety of temporal and spectral features that are difficult to explain theoretically .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 is particularly prolific by exhibiting an array of complicated temporal features .",
    "some of these temporal features occur when grs  1915 + 105 is near the eddington rate , which we find is where the mad state can cause the bz jet torque to align the material , while for slightly sub - eddington rates the lense - thirring torque dominates and could cause some precession or alignment",
    ". a combination of precession by lt , alignment by lt and bz torques , and quasi - periodic oscillations driven by the mad state and a bz jet @xcite , and variations in the magnetic field ( leading to different alignment and precessing torques ) might interact to produce such a diverse set of temporal phenomena .",
    "if accretion happens at ( or above ) eddington rates , the cosmological evolution of black hole mass and spin may not be determined by the bardeen - petterson effect , but rather by ( electro-)magnetic processes .",
    "the blandford - znajek torque can be a significant factor in a wide range of accretion rates relevant to cosmological large - scale structure simulations , so it should be taken into consideration .",
    "the event horizon telescope ( eht ) focuses on the strong - field gravity regime within tens of gravitational radii , and polarisation is capable of probing the nature of the magnetic field there @xcite .",
    "warps in the disc or bends in the jet near such scales could be revealed by changes in the polarised emission by different cancellations in the polarisation when the jet bends .",
    "our results are consistent with the self - consistent grmhd simulations by @xcite , who found disc alignment occurs within @xmath218 .",
    "this is on the scale observed by the eht , so one expects the warping of the disc or jet to manifest in eht observations .",
    "warps , oscillations , or precession could create observable timing features @xcite .",
    "if warps are present out to large radii , this can affect faraday rotation measures from discs and jets @xcite .",
    "high - energy emission from jets , as observed by fermi , could have signatures of disc or jet warps @xcite .",
    "the primary assumption made in this work is the small - angle approximation , but this has allowed us to investigate a broad space of disc models and parameters .",
    "the hope is this inspires self - consistent simulations that account for the competing roles between the lense - thirring and blandford - znajek jet torques when considering the alignment or breaking of discs .",
    "simulations are now able to account for vertical stratification , winds , magnetic fields , and radiation , which removes the ambiguity of the transitions between disc models and can account directly for these competing effects @xcite .",
    "simulation models include much more physics than we have included , and can treat the regime where the magnetic field undergoes polarity inversions @xcite , which might light up the jet to reveal the warped jet and disc .",
    "simulations in the thin disc regime can be expensive , but our results show that even a study at moderate eddington factors ( @xmath232 ) might show interesting competition between these torques while being in an astrophysically relevant regime .",
