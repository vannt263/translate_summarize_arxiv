    "galaxy gas reservoirs are the raw fuel for star formation and thus play a key role in galaxy evolution . .",
    "therefore , understanding the extent to which environment governs galaxy gas content is a fundamental ingredient to understanding galaxy assembly as a whole .",
    "several studies have highlighted the link between star formation and environment through the color - density relation , which translates into the physical understanding that galaxies in dense regions have lower star formation rates ( sfrs ) and typically older ages than those in the field @xcite .",
    "likewise , galaxies in dense environments show gas deficiencies @xcite while the most gas - rich galaxies are often found in the least dense environments @xcite .",
    "there are multiple possible connections between galaxy gas supply and the surrounding environment .",
    "for example , the low cold gas content among galaxies in dense environments can be attributed to mechanisms that cut off gas replenishment ( i.e. , starvation ; @xcite ) or directly remove gas ( e.g. , tidal , ram - pressure , or viscous stripping ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the absence of these processes ,",
    "galaxies acquire gas from their surroundings over time .",
    "fresh gas infall is needed to explain the roughly constant star formation history of the milky way @xcite , as well as the heavy element abundances in its stellar populations @xcite .",
    "regular ( and possibly overwhelming ) gas infall also explains the high gas content and exponential stellar mass growth of many dwarf galaxies in the local universe @xcite , and there are multiple examples of early - type galaxies that appear to be ( re)growing gas and stellar disks @xcite . while galaxies can acquire new gas through hierarchical merging @xcite",
    ", a more subtle but extremely important alternative mechanism is the smooth accretion of the igm , i.e. `` cosmological accretion . ''",
    "traditional theory suggests that as gas enters a dark matter halo , it shock heats to the halo s virial temperature before slowly cooling onto the galaxy @xcite . below a halo mass threshold ,",
    "the cooling timescale may be short enough that infalling gas can avoid shock heating to the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "this  cold mode \" of accretion is thought to take the form of gas streams that penetrate into halos along cosmic filaments , depositing cool gas onto galaxies much more rapidly than the traditional  hot \" mode .",
    "direct detection of cool gas streams associated with cold mode accretion is difficult since this gas is expected to be in a low - density , warm - hot ionized state that lacks detectable emission at low redshift @xcite .",
    "however , a number of high - redshift studies have detected gas through lyman-@xmath14 emission or absorption with properties consistent with cold - mode accretion @xcite , and some absorption features consistent with pristine gas infall have also been reported at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence comes from observations of neutral atomic hydrogen ( h ) emission around nearby galaxies .",
    "high - velocity clouds have been observed around many galaxies in the local group , particularly the milky way , and some of these clouds may have external origins @xcite .",
    "key group halo mass scales theoretically associated with changes in accretion can be related to observed trends in galaxy properties .",
    "the halo mass scale below which cold - mode accretion is expected to dominate over hot - mode accretion ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) matches the observed  gas - richness threshold scale \" @xcite , where gas - dominated galaxies become the norm .",
    "the scale above which cold - mode accretion is no longer present ( @xmath16 ; @xcite ) matches the  bimodality mass , \" which marks a transition between star - forming and  quenched \" galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations suggest that cold - mode accretion may be less important than previously thought , with infalling streams likely getting disrupted in the inner halo before reaching the central galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , this effect is at least somewhat balanced by a faster cooling rate for gas accreted via the hot mode .",
    "recent work has often emphasized a picture wherein galaxy gas reservoirs are largely governed by dark matter halos and their internal environments : gas accretion rates are expected to be closely tied to the masses of dark matter halos , as are many processes that deplete gas content ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that galaxy properties may also depend on the environment beyond the halo virial radius .",
    "a number of different physical mechanisms have been proposed that either remove gas or slow the infall of gas in dark matter halos in overdense regions .",
    "such environments may have higher rates of flyby interactions ( involving  ejected satellites \" or  splashback galaxies \" ) , wherein a galaxy enters a more massive halo , loses its gas content , and then escapes the inner regions , at least temporarily @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite suggest that the igm in large - scale structure leads to ram pressure stripping of hot halo gas ( particularly at @xmath17 ) , reducing the potential of galaxies to replenish their cold gas supply .",
    "halo gas accretion rates may also be lessened by competition between dark matter halos @xcite , or by longer cooling times caused by earlier heating from the gravitational collapse of cosmic structure @xcite and/or early active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present the first 21 cm data release for the resolved spectroscopy of a local volume ( resolve ) survey , a new multi - wavelength volume - limited census of galaxies in the local universe that has a large dynamic range of group halo masses ( @xmath18 ) and large - scale structure densities ( factor of @xmath19 variation ) , and probes galaxy masses down to the dwarf galaxy regime ( baryonic mass @xmath20 ) . resolve and its h census are ideally suited for environmental studies of global h - to - stellar mass ratios enabling us to address multiple key questions relating to the physical processes governing galaxy fuel supplies : how does gas content scale with halo mass ?",

    "the resolve survey benefits from a variety of multi - wavelength data .",
    "this paper presents new 21 cm observations , but an optical spectroscopic survey is under way , primarily with the soar 4.1 m telescope , and also using salt , gemini , and the aat .",
    "these observations provide either stellar or ionized gas kinematics in addition to gas and stellar metallicities .",
    "resolve also overlaps with several photometric surveys spanning near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths , which are used to estimate colors and stellar masses ( see  [ sec : ch4:photometry ] and @xcite ) .",
    "resolve is designed to be baryonic mass limited as opposed to limited in stellar mass or luminosity .",
    "we define baryonic mass as @xmath23 , where @xmath7 is the stellar mass and @xmath24 is the atomic hydrogen gas mass corrected for the contribution from helium .",
    "we ignore the contribution from molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath25 ) in the cold gas budget .",
    "h@xmath25 may be a significant gas component for intermediate - mass spirals , but for our dwarf - dominated sample , we expect it to be negligible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the baryonic mass is chosen to define the sample since it is a more fundamental characterization of _ total _ galaxy mass than is stellar mass , e.g. , as seen in the necessity to include gas mass to obtain a linear baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) @xcite , or the close association between the observed transitions in galaxy gas fractions and morphologies with _ baryonic _",

    "is then estimated by considering the range of possible baryonic mass - to - light ratios at the @xmath26 completeness limit , which yields baryonic mass completeness limits of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in resolve - a and resolve - b , respectively @xcite .",
    "since gas mass information was not available for all galaxies at the start of the resolve survey , indirect gas mass estimators ( see  [ sec : ch4:indirect_gs ] , @xcite ) were used to identify objects with @xmath27-band magnitudes below the nominal completeness limit but with potentially high baryonic mass - to - light ratios .",
