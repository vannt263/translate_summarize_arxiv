    "when considering application of quantum information processing , two main ingredients must be considered - entanglement and decoherence . while entanglement , or non - local coherence , plays a key role in qubit operations @xcite , decoherence sets the limit to which such operations may be performed @xcite .",
    "decoherence may result from the interaction of the quantum system with a dissipative environment @xcite , dramatically affecting the dynamics of the quantum system , and its entanglement properties .",
    "specifically , it was recently shown @xcite that a ( non interacting ) two - qubit system can be completely disentangled in a finite time , a phenomenon dubbed `` entanglement sudden death '' .",
    "this was followed by a plethora of theoretical studies of this phenomenon in various situations , most of them treating non - interacting qubits ( i.e. a pair of qubits which interact with each other only in the mediation of the environment ) , either with a markovian or non - markovian environment @xcite . from the experimental side , direct measurements of entanglement",
    "have been performed @xcite , and the `` entanglement sudden death '' was observed @xcite .",
    "the loss of entanglement seems to be a generic feature of two - qubit systems @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study a simple system where entanglement sudden death may be avoided . for this aim we study a simple model of an interacting two - qubit system in the presence of a thermal dissipative bath .",
    "we model the qubits as interacting spin-@xmath0 particles in a magnetic field @xcite and use the born - markov approximation for the system - environment coupling .",
    "the environment is assumed to be ohmic and induce thermal transitions , and it only allows for single spin - flip events ( in similarity to spin - boson models @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate analytically the full dynamics of this system , with emphasis given to the different relaxation rates .",
    "we point out here that we use the term `` relaxation rates '' loosely , to describe the time - scales of both processes which include energy changes ( relaxation ) and only coherence loss ( decoherence ) .",
    "both types of processes are inherently present in our calculation scheme .",
    "we show that although the coupling with the environment is characterized by a single relaxation rate , different relaxation rates emerge for different coherent states .",
    "we study the effect of temperature and magnetic field on the different relaxation rates and find that they may be non - monotonous functions of temperature .    as the main results of this paper ,",
    "we demonstrate that as a function of the magnetic field the relaxation rate of the highly - entangled states abruptly changes from being finite as the temperature vanishes to being exponentially small .",
    "this occurs when one of the states of the entangled pair is in a meta - stable state , and indicates that with a proper tuning of parameters the entanglement may survive very long times even in the presence of a dissipative environment .",
    "we demonstrate the long - lifeness of entanglement by calculating the concurrence of a specific entangled state , and show that applying a transverse magnetic field destroys this effect .",
    "finally , we devise a simple way to account for non - markovian effects when calculating relaxation rates . studying the relaxation rates as a function of the environment memory - time ,",
    "we find that some relaxation rates exhibit a non - monotonic dependence on the memory - time , with a cusp - like resonance . for long memory - times ,",
    "the different relaxation rates merge into a single rate .",
    "let us introduce our method for calculating the relaxation times .",
    "we consider a quantum system , characterized by a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath1 with @xmath2 energy levels @xmath3 .",
    "the system dynamics are given by the evolution of the density matrix @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite for the above choice of hamiltonian , in the markovian approximation the evolution of the density matrix is given by a quantum master equation @xcite ( @xmath6 , ( t)=-i [ , ] + [ quantummasterequation ]  , where @xmath7 is a superoperator describing the dissipative dynamics .",
    "it is commonly takes the lindblad form @xcite = _ i ( -\\{v^_i v_i , } + v_i v^_i )  , [ lindbladequation1](where @xmath8 are the anti - commutation relations ) , which ensures positivity of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-operators define the different relaxation processes induced by the environment .",
    "we now follow ref .",
    "@xcite and cast the density matrix into a vector form , defining @xmath10 . here",
    "the first @xmath2 elements account for occupation probabilities and the other elements describe coherence between the states in the statistical mixture .",
    "it is now a matter of rearranging the master equation into a form @xmath11 , where now @xmath12 is a matrix of dimension @xmath13 which includes both the hamiltonian and the dissipative part of the evolution .    due to the semi - group properties the lindblad equation , ( at least ) one of the eigenvalues of @xmath12 is exactly zero @xcite .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue is the steady - state of the system , i.e. the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the other eigenvalues may have an imaginary part , but all of them have a negative real part , which correspond to the relaxation rate of the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "thus , by calculating the eigenvalues of @xmath12 one obtains the relaxation rates for all possible processes . for the most general initial condition , the smallest non - vanishing eigenvalue of @xmath12 ( which we call @xmath15 ) represents the longest relaxation rate .",
    "next we consider the application of the above method to our model two - qubit system .",
    "the hamiltonian , with ising interactions , can be written as = -2 js^(1)_z s^(2)_z+**b**_i=1,2 * * s**^(i )  , [ ham1]where @xmath16 are the two qubit levels ( i.e. spin=@xmath0 particles ) , @xmath17 describes the interactions and @xmath18 is the external magnetic field .",
    "this choice of hamiltonian is not only convenient ( the hamiltonian being very simple ) , but also represents several suggestions for realistic , spin - based quantum computers @xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we start with magnetic field only in the @xmath19-direction , i.e. @xmath20 with @xmath21 . choosing as a basis the four states @xmath22 ( which we number from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , respectively ) , the hamiltonian can be written ( up to a constant energy shift ) as =(    cccc -j - b & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & -j+b +    )  .",
    "[ h ]     in order to account for the environment , the spins are coupled to one that induces spin - flip processes , represented by the @xmath9-operators in eq .",
    "[ lindbladequation1 ] . here",
    "we make two assumptions , namely ( i ) the spins are flipped one at a time ( i.e. there is no direct relaxation from the @xmath25 state to the @xmath26 state , etc . ) and ( ii ) the relaxation rate between two states is proportional to the boltzman factor of the corresponding energy difference between the states @xcite ( these two assumptions on the form of the @xmath9-operators reflect the properties of the environment as described in the introduction ) . for example , the relaxation operator from @xmath25 to @xmath27 ( taking @xmath28 ) is @xcite v_12&=&_12 ^ 1/2| | _ 12&= & ( - )  , where @xmath29 is some typical relaxation rate which represents the strength of the qubit - environment coupling . for the reverse process",
    "the relaxation operator is v_21&=&_21 ^ 1/2| | _ 21&= & ( )  , so that the condition of detailed balance is maintained , i.e. @xmath30 . note that one can normalize the transition rate in different ways and still maintain detailed balance .",
    "here we choose such a normalization that keeps all relaxation rates finite ( even at @xmath31 and preserves the @xmath32 symmetry ( i.e. , does not depend on the gauge of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "however , all the qualitative results presented in this paper equally apply for a different choice of the normalization of the @xmath9-operators .",
    "once the form of the @xmath9-operators is specified , it is now a matter of algebraic manipulation to obtain the @xmath12-matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors . for the steady state",
    "we find ( ) & = & z^-1 ( | |+ e^| | .",
    "& & .+e^(| |+| | ) )  , [ ss ] with @xmath33 being the partition function of the system , which results in a pure @xmath25 state ( which is the ground state of the hamiltonian ) in the limit of @xmath34 .    for the above example",
    ", all the eigenvalues may be calculated analytically . for the lowest rate",
    "1=1-  , [ lambda]which is @xmath35-fold degenerate .",
    "two states contain @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( i.e. a coherence between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , and the third is a mixture of all the diagonal elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 . inspection of @xmath15 in the limit @xmath34 shows that _ t0 _ 1= \\ {    c 0 ,  b < j + _ 0/2 ,  b = j + _ 0 ,   b > j    .  .",
    "[ lambda1 ] this means that for @xmath40 the relaxation time from the coherent @xmath36 state diverges , i.e. the system _ never _ reaches its thermal , disentangled , ground state .",
    "however , for @xmath41 it relaxes to the ground state in a time scale @xmath42 .",
    "this can be easily explained from the following considerations .",
    "note that the @xmath26 state can only relax into one of the degenerate middle states , @xmath27 or @xmath43 . for @xmath44 ,",
    "its energy is negative ( but higher than the ground state energy ) , and therefore the relaxation rate is exponentially small .",
    "put it differently , the @xmath26 state is a meta - stable state which requires an exponentially rare correlated event to escape from . for @xmath45 , however , the energy of @xmath26 is no longer negative , and hence it can relax into the ground state by a cascade relaxation through the middle states .",
    "while all the other eigenvalues are available analytically , writing them in full form is cumbersome , and thus we present them graphically . in fig .",

    "( [ ss ] ) and @xmath58 . by making this choice",

    "( [ lambda1 ] ) .",
    "we point out that one can start with any initial diagonal elements and obtain results similar to those presented below , since the diagonal elements quickly relax to the steady - state ( eq .",

    "a transverse field can either represent an inherent interaction between the two qubit states , or an actual field ( in the qubit relevant hilbert space ) , which is used to perform quantum operations .",
    "since both these ingredients appear in any implementation of a physical qubit , it is important to study their effect on the relaxation time - scales .",

    "in the markovian approximation , the evolution of the system does not depend on its history .",
    "this approximation applies when the correlation times of the thermal bath are much smaller than any timescale associated with the system under consideration . however , there are cases where the bath reacts to the dynamics of the system over a certain memory time , @xmath68 , and the markov approximation is thus not valid . in such instances ,",

    "non - markovian effects on the entanglement dynamics have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite .    in order to include non - markovian effects",
