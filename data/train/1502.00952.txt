    "the exclusion process is a lattice interacting particle system where particles perform independent nearest - neighbor random walks with the added constraint that each site can be occupied by at most one particle ( see the classic references @xcite and @xcite for a complete introduction to the subject ) .",
    "it is a very simplified model for a gas of interacting particles .",
    "we consider in this the case were the lattice is either a @xmath11-dimensional torus or hypercube of side length  @xmath2 .",
    "the number of particle is chosen to be proportional to the number of sites .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the particle system starting far away from equilibrium , relaxes to its equilibrium state .",
    "this question can in fact be treated with different point of views :    * one can describe the evolution of the system at the macroscopic level , giving the evolution of the density of particle in space and time .",
    "this is the study of hydrodynamic limits ( see @xcite for an introduction to the subject ) .",
    "* one can adopt a microscopic point of view , and look at the evolution of the law of the particle , and in particular , its total variation distance to the equilibrium law .",
    "this is the study of the markov chain s mixing time ( see @xcite ) .    with the first point of view , it is now well known that under diffusive rescaling ( space rescaled by @xmath2 and time rescaled buy @xmath12 ) , the density of particle evolves like the solution of the heat equation .",
    "the result is valid in any dimension ( see @xcite for references ) .    concerning the mixing - time approach , progresses are more recent .",
    "it has been shown by morris that in any dimension the time needed to come close to equilibrium in total variation was of order @xmath13 @xcite . in dimension @xmath14 ,",
    "more refined estimates have been obtained and gave the exact location of the mixing time either for the segment @xcite or the circle @xcite with lower bounds proved earlier by wilson @xcite ( see also @xcite for results in the case of arbitrary graph , and @xcite ) .",
    "a natural question is then what does the law of the particle system look like when it is about to reach equilibrium .    at equilibrium ,",
    "the law of the distribution is uniform over all particle configurations .",
    "another way to see it is to say that the state of each site ( occupied or vacant ) is given by a field of i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli variables whose sum is conditioned to be equal to the number of particle ( which is a fixed parameter ) .",
    "what would be natural to expect then , is that up to a small correction , before equilibrium , the particle distribution still is a conditioned product measure , but that the bernoulli variables are no more identically distributed : there is a space dependent bias which is given by the solution of the heat equation .",
    "this brings a strong connection between the problem of the mixing time and that of the hydrodynamical limit .",
    "this connection was previously underlined by lee and yau when studying the related issue of @xmath15-sobolev constant for the simple exclusion @xcite . indeed in the case of small bias , with some minor efforts one can derive sharp estimates on the total - variation distance between the conditioned product of biased bernoulli and the equilibrium measure .",
    "this can be turned into a precise prediction on how the total - variation distance drops from one to zero , the cutoff profile .",
    "the present paper brings this heuristic picture on a rigorous ground in the case of the exclusion on the circle .",
    "we consider @xmath16 , the discrete circle with @xmath1 sites and we place @xmath2 particles on it , with _ at most _ one particle per site . with a slight abuse of notation , we will sometimes use elements of @xmath17 to refer to elements of @xmath18 .",
    "the exclusion process on @xmath18 is a dynamical evolution of the particle system which can be described informally as follows : each particle tries to jump independently on its neighbors with transition rates @xmath19 , but the jumps are canceled if a particle tries to jump on a site which is already occupied .",
    "let us describe the chain more formally .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath14 denotes a particle and @xmath201 denotes an empty site .",
    "this is not the most usual one ( empty sites are more often denoted by @xmath21 ) but it proves to be more practical in our computations .",
    "our state - space is defined by @xmath22 given @xmath23 define @xmath24 the configuration obtained by exchanging the content of site @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 the exclusion process on @xmath18 with @xmath2 particle is the continuous time markov process on @xmath28 whose generator is given by @xmath29 the chain is irreducible and reversible , and the unique invariant probability measure is the uniform probability measure on @xmath30 which we denote by @xmath31 . given @xmath32 we let @xmath33 denote the trajectory of the markov chain starting from  @xmath3 .",
    "we write @xmath34 $ ] for the law of @xmath33 .",
    "we let @xmath0 denote the markov semi - group and write @xmath35 for the probability measure @xmath36 , @xmath32 .",
    "we measure the distance to equilibrium in terms of total variation distance .",
    "if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two probability measures on @xmath39 , the total variation distance between @xmath37 and @xmath40 is defined to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the positive part of @xmath25 .",
    "it measures how well one can couple two variables with law @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we define the distance to equilibrium of the markov chain to be @xmath43    in a previous paper @xcite , we described in detail the asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 .",

    ", we are interested in proving the existence and finding an expression for limiting profile @xmath46    to reach this goal , we have to understand what the distribution @xmath47 looks like much before the time @xmath7 .      the main achievement of our paper is to determine the cutoff profile .",
    "[ maintheorem ] the total - variation distance to equilibrium from the worst initial condition has the following asymptotic profile : for any @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gauss error function @xmath51    the method by which we obtain the result gives us in fact much more information about the relaxation of the system : we are able to characterize fully how @xmath52 looks like much before the mixing time , for all initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "the fact that the profile of the cutoff is given by a function of the type @xmath53 ( the constant is not essential since it depends on the particular process and the choice for the normalization ) is given by wilson @xcite as a conjecture ( supported by numerical evidences ) for a process very much related to the exclusion : the adjacent transposition shuffle .",
    "the reason why the function @xmath50 appears is that the last statistic that comes to equilibrium for the process ( here the first fourier coefficient of @xmath54 , see below ) is well approximated by a gaussian ; the exponential terms are present because the mean of this gaussian converges exponentially to zero .",
    "this is a property which is believed to be shared by many markov chains and rigorously known , for example , the random walk on the hypercube @xcite .",
    "let us mention that however there are the markov chains which exhibit cutoff and do not have this property .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of top to random shuffle @xcite , and also of the transposition shuffle for which the important statistic , the number of fixed point , behaves like a poisson variable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of the paper , from which we deduce theorem  [ maintheorem ] requires some notation to be introduced .",
    "the time evolution of the density of particles is given by the discrete heat equation on @xmath18 and for this reason , the eigenfunction of the discrete laplacian on the circle plays an important role in our analysis ; in particular , those in the eigenspace corresponding to the spectral gap : @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .    to describe the projection of @xmath32 on this eigenspace , it is more convenient for us to have one positive coefficient than two real ones , and for this reason we introduce @xmath57 which is the `` phase '' of @xmath3 in the first eigenspace .",
    "it is the unique @xmath58 satisfying @xmath59\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber \\sum_{x\\in{{\\mathbb z}}_{2n } } \\chi(x ) \\sin \\biggl(\\frac{\\pi x}{n}+ \\theta \\biggr ) & > & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath60 if the system has no solution .",
