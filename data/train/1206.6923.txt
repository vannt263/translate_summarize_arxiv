    "understanding formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the main goals of extra - galactic astrophysics .",
    "this study is approached from two sides , an observational one and a theoretical one . on the one hand ,",
    "observations become more and more detailed , producing ever larger images and catalogues that need to be analyzed . on the other hand",
    ", theoretical research produces ever more refined models describing the formation and evolutionary processes in ever greater detail , often using sophisticated cosmological computer simulations that create enormous , physically motivated data sets .",
    "the increasing specialization and technical sophistication required means that it becomes a problem to successfully match these two approaches as few scientists are familiar with all the details on both the observational and the theoretical side .",
    "for example , it is often difficult for non - experts to understand detailed galaxy formation models or to predict how model parameter changes affect the predictions .",
    "likewise , theorists are often unfamiliar with the extensive processing and the inverse methods that need to be applied to observations in order to derive physical properties that can be matched to the model predictions .    from an observational perspective",
    ", the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) consortium played a pivotal role in opening up the results of one of the most sophisticated observational programs ever performed to the community . through a public database of raw measurements , processed results , and ` value - added ' products , a great many hurdles were removed for using the results of the survey . from a theoretical perspective , the millennium run database ( mrdb ) was the first to make the results of large scale cosmological simulations widely accessible to a broad - based audience .",
    "analogous to the sdss data , the richness of the theoretical data sets available in the mrdb has allowed a wide variety of scientific queries to be performed .    the comparison between cosmological model predictions and observations has historically been performed mostly in one direction only : physical quantities estimated from observations are compared with theoretical predictions . the latter are not affected by the issues that affect the observations , such as incompleteness , contamination , cosmic variance , finite signal - to - noise , or limited resolution .",
    "these are typically assumed to be corrected for in full during the processing of the observations , although some authors have included some of these effects in a number of ways in order to be able to more realistically compare data and predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we propose that the comparison between models and observations should also be performed in the opposite direction .",
    "the strength of this method lies in the fact that one can never be sure to extract the truth out of observations , but one will always know what the true answer is in a set of synthetic observations based on the simulations .",
    "synthetic observations like we propose would also allow one to explore the uniqueness of possible solutions that are found , as different models or different parameter sets may produce indistinguishable synthetic observations .",
    "in this paper we present an extension of the mr cosmological simulations project , which we will henceforth refer to as the _ millennium run observatory _ ( mrobs ) .",
    "it aims to bridge the gap between the two approaches by making the final step from realistic simulations to the observational plane .",
    "mrobs consists of a fully connected set of synthetic data products combined into a unique online framework that ranges from the most fundamental simulations to realistic , synthetic observations .    with the introduction of ` lightcones ' , the comparison between simulations and observations has been greatly enhanced .",
    "this technique allows one to project the galaxy distribution predicted for a set of discrete simulation snapshots along a virtual observer s line of sight , mimicking the main geometric and photometric effects present in deep galaxy surveys @xcite . however , even the lightcone approach to model - data comparisons is still very much idealized . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a typical observational scenario of determining the stellar mass function of high redshift galaxies in a multi - wavelength imaging survey .",
    "such an analysis typically begins with the extraction of sources and their photometric properties across a set of calibrated and registered filter images . due to missed light",
    ", it is often necessary to make corrections to the measured magnitudes .",
    "then , photometric redshifts and physical parameters of the galaxies ( e.g. , stellar mass , age , sfr ) are estimated by fitting the photometry with a set of template galaxy spectra .",
    "it is important to note that the results often depend on , e.g. , the source detection and photometry method , the choice of template spectra , and the fitting method . in order to calculate the number of galaxies detected in different stellar mass bins over different redshift intervals",
    ", it is often required to calculate the ` effective volume ' of the survey .",
    "the latter is an estimate of the completeness of the sample , and usually depends on redshift , limiting magnitude , galaxy colour or size in complicated ways .",
    "this last step can be performed by estimating the probability of recovering certain sources at a given survey depth .",
    "such estimates typically depend on the true source population which is a priori unknown . at the end of the process ,",
    "the stellar mass function estimate is used for comparison with other observational studies , or to constrain certain theoretical models or simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "it should be clear from the process outlined above that a great number of non - trivial steps need to be performed before any comparison with theory can be made .",
    "how better could we test all these steps than by processing the output from the simulations , for which all quantities are exactly known , through the same kind of data analysis pipeline as the real observations",
    "?      we will take the process of simulating the galaxy population for comparison with observations into largely unexplored territory by simulating the observational process applied to the mr simulations .",
    "the main aims of the mrobs are as follows : + @xmath0 extend the mr project approach by producing data products most directly corresponding to observations , namely synthetic images and extracted source catalogs + @xmath0 aid theorists in testing analytical models to observations + @xmath0 aid observers in making detailed predictions for observations and better analyses of observational data + @xmath0 allow the community to subject the models to new kinds of tests + @xmath0 allow observers and theorists to work toward each other from either direction with the freedom of where to meet + @xmath0 allow detailed comparisons with synthetic observations produced by other groups performing cosmological simulations + @xmath0 allow calibration of observational analysis methods by making available synthetic data for which the entire underlying ` reality ' is known + @xmath0 extend the realism with which semi - analytic models can address questions such as what is the probability that a @xmath1 galaxy will be detected within a particular observational data set ?",
    "+ @xmath0 provide a framework for future virtual theoretical observatories +      only recently have simulations become sophisticated enough to allow realistic visualizations of the galaxy population on a cosmological scale . in order to illustrate the particular place that the mrobs occupies within this simulations landscape",
    ", we give a short overview of related work in the literature .",
    "astronomical image simulation software has been developed and used previously , mostly to aid in the development of data processing pipelines for new telescopes and instruments , for proposal planning , or for testing the accuracy of specific measurement tools ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "current hydro simulations of the galaxy population are substantially further from the observations than semi - analytical models .",
    "@xcite pioneered in the production of realistic artificial telescope data based on lightcones extracted from their semi - analytic model .",
    "that paper already laid out most of the workflow that we use here ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ) : dark matter particle simulations are used to construct halo merger trees on which a semi - analytic model is run .",
    "the output from the sam is used to construct galaxy lightcones that are used as input for artificial telescope image simulations .",
    "galaxies are extracted from the artificial images using standard observational tools ( e.g. sextractor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting galaxy catalogs are compared to the original simulations at different levels , or to actual observations . unfortunately , however , the methods of @xcite were never employed on a large scale , and in subsequent years the comparison between sams and real observations has been mostly performed at the lightcone level or even at the snapshot level , thereby sidestepping many of the details involved in analyzing real telescope data that observers typically have to go through . as we shall show , however , numerous problems in the field of galaxy evolution could benefit from a simulation that accounts for the entire observational process .",
    "this leads to new insights involving details that are missed by higher - level comparisons between data and simulations . by expanding on the basic ideas of @xcite , the mrobs aims at making this possible .",
    "although in this paper we lay out the motivation and framework for producing synthetic data from cosmological simulations in general , the mrobs is based around the suite of mr simulations . through the combination of simulations volume and particle resolution , an active development of semi - analytic models , and an online database providing access to numerous data products ,",

    "we introduce this noise correlation in our mock images by smoothing the mock images with a small gaussian kernel ( of about 1.5 pixels fwhm , in this case ) .    the background noise versus aperture size in the real candels images ( red solid lines ) and our mock candels images ( blue dashed lines ) .",
    "the noise in the mock and real data is nearly identical .",
    "the true image noise in the absence of correlated noise introduced by the drizzling process is somewhat higher ( blue dotted lines ) . ]    in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : candelsimages ] we show a portion of the final simulated candels images in the filters f125w and f160w . in the panels on the right , we show a region of the real candels uds images , displayed at the same zoom level and at the same colour stretch as the mock images shown on the left . at a qualitative level the images are remarkably similar .",
    "note that this is not only the result of our accurate image simulation technique , but also because our input galaxy population apparently has a striking resemblance to the observed one ( e.g. , in terms of number density , clustering , size and shape distributions , and brightness ) .",
    "however , before we can compare the galaxy populations in the simulated and the real data , we need to ensure that the image properties of our simulated data are indeed quantitatively similar to the real data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : candelsdepth ] we show the measured background noise fluctuations as a function of aperture diameter as measured in the real candels images ( red solid lines ) versus that measured in our simulated data set .",
    "the blue dotted lines indicate the ( true ) noise level in the absence of correlated noise . when we introduce the correlated noise resulting from the drizzling process , we get a near perfect match between the simulated ( blue dashed lines ) and real ( red solid lines ) candels uds images . as a second test",
    ", we look at the distribution of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for objects detected in the real and simulated images .",
    "we ran sextractor using identical detection parameters on the real and simulated images , and plot the isophotal s / n versus the measured magnitudes .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : candelssn ] for the mock data ( left panels ) and the real data ( right panels ) .",
    "again , the s / n distributions are very similar between the real and simulated data , indicating that our image simulations are accurate .    the isophotal signal - to - noise ratio in @xmath107 and @xmath103 versus the total magnitude of detected objects as measured by sextractor . the signal - to - noise ratio distributions in the mock and the real candels images are very similar .",
    "]    in  [ sec : counts ] we show an application of these candels simulations by comparing the galaxy number counts in our semi - analytic mock lightcones with those extracted from our mock images , and with those in the real candels images .",
    "the simulated candels data produced here are part of our first scientific data release as announced in  [ sec : publicrelease ] .",
    "one of the most basic tests that are used to test the accuracy of semi - analytic model predictions is to compare the number counts of galaxies observed as a function of apparent magnitude in some band with those predicted by a mock lightcone observation constructed from the semi - analytic model as described in  [ sec : lightcones ] .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , these light - cones do not suffer from any of the observational effects afflicting real observations .",
    "the mrobs approach to modeling discussed in sections [ sec : igm ] to [ sec : sextractor ] allows us to make comparisons between observations and semi - analytic predictions in a highly realistic way . by simulating a mock survey matched to the real observations that one wants to compare with , and then running source extraction and photometry software on the mock and real images in identical manner , we can in principle",
    "assess how certain observational biases affect the interpretation of the real data , and how this impacts on our comparison of those real data with the simulations .",
    "of course , one has to be aware that other biases may be introduced simply due to the fact that the models are likely no perfect match to the real data .                 as a first example",
    ", we compare the number counts measured from a mock lightcone to those derived from our mock images based on that lightcone .",
    "[ fig : candelscounts ] shows the two types of number counts from our simulated candels uds data in blue compared to the plain light cone data in black .",
    "the counts extracted from the simulated image were not corrected for completeness . at bright magnitudes ( @xmath117 mag )",
    "the counts are in good agreement , but they diverge toward fainter magnitudes counts detected in the images compared to the lightcone on which the mock images are based .",
    "the extracted counts are about a factor of 2 lower than the lightcone counts at @xmath118 mag .    the red lines in the figure show number counts measured in the real candels uds data ( no completeness corrections applied ) .",
    "at the faint end , the lightcone substantially over - predicts the observed counts , similar to discrepancies between semi - analytic predictions and observations found in earlier studies .",
    "however , it is very interesting to note that the difference between the semi - analytic predictions and the real number counts becomes smaller when we compare the real data to our mock data . simply by ` observing ' the lightcone we already lose a significant number of galaxies that would not be detected in a real observation ( if the lightcone was an accurate reflection of reality ) .",
    "the results presented in fig . [ fig : candelscounts ] suggest that it is important to take observational effects into account when comparing real data with simulations .",
    "these effects need to be quantified before one can change the parameters in a semi - analytic model to better match the observations . with the mock data produced by and published through the mrobs these tests",
    "can now be performed easily .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the number counts in synthetic observations as predicted by the mrobs compared to those predicted by ordinary semi - analytical models will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
    "our new lightcone ` aiming ' technique described in ",
    "[ sec : aiming ] offers an efficient way for predicting the detailed observational properties of , for example , galaxy clusters . here",
    "we present mock sdss and hst observations of a massive galaxy cluster at different redshifts and orientations .",
    "the cluster was selected from the roughly 3,000 clusters in the mr , and has a total dark matter mass of @xmath119 @xmath3 at @xmath5 .",
    "the selection was performed using the table of friends - of - friends groups in the mrdb . after finding fof groups in the right mass range ,",
    "a random selection was made of a cluster .",
    "that cluster was traced backwards in time using the table with halo merger trees . at desired redshifts",
    "the position of the cluster s main progenitor was returned .",
    "that position , together with a direction and using the co - moving distance corresponding to the redshift , was used to define a light cone that had the cluster at its center and at exactly the correct redshift .",
    "this cone was then observed using a few different virtual telescope configurations .    in the first example , we have produced mock sdss images in @xmath120 showing what this cluster would look like at redshifts from @xmath121 to @xmath122 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss ] ) .",
    "these mock data can be compared directly with real clusters found in the sdss .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss ] that the study of galaxy clusters in the sdss survey becomes challenging already at moderately high redshifts . as a second example , we therefore show a mock image of the same cluster , now seen at @xmath123 and observed with hst / acs in the filters @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cl0024 ] , left panel ) .",
    "in the right panel we show an actual hst image of the well - studied @xmath123 cluster cl0024 with a comparable dark matter mass @xcite .",
    "the images were produced using identical parameter settings in the software that produces the colour images from the ` .fits ` files ( see  [ sec : pyramids ] ) .",
    "although both clusters have a dominant population of red sequence galaxies that appear almost identical in these hst / acs colours , the real cluster appears to have a greater number of cluster galaxies than the mock cluster .",
    "the mr contains thousands of these type of galaxy clusters suitable for data - mining .",
    "users will be able to use mock observations such as these to compare the properties of simulated and real clusters in a quantitative manner .",
    "our third example highlights another unique feature of our improved lightcone technique , which allows us to produce observations of structures seen from different directions .",
    "each light cone is created following the same principle as above , the only difference being that the cluster is observed from different directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hizcluster ] we show mock hst images in @xmath125 of the same cluster shown before , but now at @xmath126 .",
    "panels show the exact same cluster viewed from three different directions , with ( proto-)cluster galaxies having log@xmath127 marked with white circles .",
    "the large yellow circle marks the virial radius of the central halo .",
    "while the projected distribution of cluster galaxies appears roughly spherical in the first two orientations ( left and middle panels ) , it is much more filamentary in the third orientation ( right panel ) .",
    "the line of sight velocity dispersions in the three cases are 807 , 704 , and 568 km s@xmath30 .",
    "this example illustrates that projection effects are important to take into account when studying the assembly of galaxy clusters , especially at high redshift where both the samples of clusters and the number of identified cluster galaxies are relatively small .",
    "the multi - wavelength nature of the mrobs data allows for the detailed testing , calibrating and tuning cluster detection algorithms using physically - motivated cluster samples .",
    "+          another new test facilitated by the mrobs is comparison of the structural properties of galaxies in the semi - analytic model to those in real observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msfr ] we show a stellar mass versus sfr diagram for galaxies between @xmath128 and @xmath129 selected from one of our mock lightcone catalogs . in the panel on the right , we show @xmath130 postage stamps indicating the appearance of these galaxies in our simulated hst data ( the image stamps are drawn from a mock @xmath131 colour - composite image based on the hst / ers survey ) .",
    "these mock data can be used to measure galaxy structural properties ( e.g. , sersic index , bulge - to - disk ratio , inclination ) , sizes and colours in exactly the same way as typically performed on real data only . by comparing measurements made based on the mock images with the exact physical quantities given by the semi - analytic model users",
    "could test how well such values can be recovered for a given data set , or for a given galaxy population .",
    "it also allows users to compare the structural properties of mock and real galaxies in a relatively unbiased way .",
    "the last example we show here is the use of the mrobs in the selection of high redshift dropout galaxies from deep multi - wavelength imaging surveys and predictions thereof ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",

    "objects at these high redshift suffer severe attenuation from the igm in their spectra blue - ward of ly@xmath57  ( see  [ sec : igm ] ) .",
    "consequently , these objects can be isolated from lower redshift galaxy population , as their lyman break redshifts through a strategically chosen set of filters .",
    "panels on the top show colour distributions for all objects found in one of our mock lightcones .",
    "the bottom panels show those objects that were detected in a mock survey based on the same lightcone .",
    "the limiting magnitudes used for the lightcone and for the extracted catalog were the same .",
    "this figure highlights some of the main differences between a pure semi - analytic model prediction ( top panels ) and what an observer actually sees ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the colours of galaxies extracted from mock images are significantly scattered compared to their true ( input ) colours , making it harder to distinguish between low and high redshifts , or to derive their physical properties ( e.g. , redshift , mass , dust , star formation history , sfr ) based on fitting their observed colours to a set of spectral synthesis models .",
    "it is straightforward to study and quantify such effects through the use of these kind of mock data . in the mrdb sql queries",
    "can be performed to cross - match the sextractor output catalogs to the lightcone or semi - analytic input catalogs , allowing one to investigate in detail the offsets between intrinsic and apparent properties , and to study which galaxies are included and excluded by certain observational selection criteria ( e.g. colour - colour selections ) .",
    "as described above , the mrobs builds upon and extends the popular mrdb .",
    "apart from the images , all the datasets produced by the mrobs and described in this paper are stored in a database that is accessible through the same interface as the mrdb itself and can be directly joined to the existing data sets . here",
    "we give a summary description of the database and access methods , focusing on the new data products and how they are linked to the existing ones .",
    "the mrdb is a relational database , where data sets are stored in tables ( relations ) .",
    "a table generally stores objects of a particular type , with properties of these objects stored in columns .",
    "for example we have tables storing the the positions and velocities of particles from an n - body simulation , albeit a small one .",
    "we have tables with fof groups and sub - halos as well as galaxies and many more .",
    "the web site giving access to these tables provides all information about the structure of the database .",
    "an important feature of relational database design in general , and the mrdb in particular , is the possibility to manifest relations or links between objects in different tables .",
    "for example , a galaxy in the munich semi - analytical model is always embedded in a subhalo .",
    "this relation is stored in the tables with galaxies as a column storing the ( unique ) identifier of the corresponding halo .",
    "the mrdb has a particularly rich set of such relations , especially where it deals with the relations between objects of the same type at different times @xcite .",
    "recent additions to the database were the results of the latest version of the munich sam from @xcite and pencil - beam and all sky light - cones derived from these in @xcite .",
    "the images produced by the mrobs from such light - cones do not lend themselves easily for storing in a database .",
    "however the sextractor catalogues extracted from the images have been stored and we also have tables storing the different igm absorption models described in  [ sec : igm ] .",
    "more information and examples on how to apply and cross - correlate the various mrdb and mrobs data sets are documented at the url given below .",
    "the mrobs delivers a number of entirely new data products to the community that are useful for independent analysis , or for serving as the starting point for new simulations . here",
    "we will briefly describe the different types of new products .",
    "the random field lightcones released as part of this paper are identical to the 24 multiwavelength lightcones measuring @xmath137 on the sky from @xcite , but with structural information added .",
    "the new structural information ( sizes of the disk and bulge components , inclinations and position angles ) is crucial for building the accurate galaxy models predicted by the mr simulations .",
    "these lightcones can be used , for example , to compare structural properties measured off the simulated images to the true input values .",
    "they can also be used as the starting point for users wishing to perform their own image simulations using realistic input catalogs based on the mr .",
    "in addition to the ` random ' lightcones , we also release entirely new lightcones that specifically target galaxy clusters at a range of redshifts ( see  [ sec : aiming ] and  [ sec : examples_clusters ] ) .",
    "all these lightcone catalogs are made available through the mrdb .",
    "we provide tables that list the mean igm attenuation as a function of redshift for a range of models ( see  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the igm tables are applied to the lightcones to predict accurate colours and magnitudes of galaxies with redshift .",
    "information from the structural light cones , the igm tables , and a plate scale are combined to generate the input to the skymaker code that we use to create our synthetic ` pre - observation ' images .",
    "these object lists may be used by other synthetic image simulators .      as described in  [ sec : sims ] , for each filter we build a so - called pre - observation or ` perfect ' image that is based on the input object list .",
    "these images can be seen as a representation of the sky free of noise , psf , or background .",
    "as such , they are easily convolved , rebinned , and scaled to match an arbitrary observation ( typically a combination of a given telescope , camera , and exposure ) .",
    "the ` perfect ' images are turned into synthetic images that simulate real observational data .",
    "these images can be downloaded for further analysis .",
    "we also provide the psf images that were used to convolve the perfect images to the instrument resolution , as well as documentation providing full details of how the images were produced .",
    "the simulated images are processed using sextractor to produce the so - called segmentation maps identifying which image pixels correspond to which detected object , as well as the standard sextractor output photometry catalogs .",
    "the sextractor catalogs are made available through the mrdb where they can be searched or cross - matched with other data , such as lightcone catalogs , semi - analytic snapshots , dark matter halos , or density fields .",
    "the segmentation images are available for download .      in its current deployment ,",
    "the mrobs offers a number of data sets conveniently matched to some of the most popular extra - galactic surveys ( e.g. the sdss , cfht - ls wide and deep , goods , udf , goods / ers , and candels ) for use by the community .",
    "updates and future data releases will be announced through the mr web portal ( url given below ) , and in forthcoming publications .",
    "a special feature of the mrobs is that many of the data sets can also be accessed directly by means of our interactive mrobs image browser .",
    "this is an online tool that allows users to scan over and zoom into the synthetic images .",
    "these images are linked to the backend database ( the mrdb ) through a simple point - and - click function that allows retrieval of detailed information about the galaxies that are displayed .",
    "this is useful , for example , for familiarizing oneself with the relation between physical and observed properties of different types of galaxies or galaxies at different redshifts , for selecting interesting objects from the mr simulations for subsequent analysis , for comparing the quality expected for different types of data sets or telescopes , and for didactical and outreach purposes .",
    "here we describe the main features of the mrobs browser in brief .    an image pyramid consisting of three levels is shown . at its lowest resolution level ,",
    "the image consists of a single @xmath138 pixels tile having 1/4th of the true image resolution . at the base of the pyramid",
    ", the image is divided into @xmath139 full - resolution tiles each measuring @xmath138 pixels .",
    "the mrobs deep zoom image browser makes heavy use of these kinds of tilings for an efficient viewing of the data .",
    "the browser also makes a translation between pixel coordinates and wcs coordinates within each viewport .",
    "this conveniently enables the user to retrieve high - level properties of any object found within the image by matching its sky coordinates to the underlying lightcone catalog , and by querying the galaxy or halo catalogs stored on the mrdb server based on the ` galaxyid ` or ` haloid ` of any matches found . ]",
    "the images produced by the mrobs are typically very large .",
    "for example , a simulated hst survey covering an area of @xmath140 at a ( drizzled ) pixel scale of @xmath141 already measures 20,000@xmath10620,000 pixels ( 400 megapixels ) , and in principle the mrobs could create much larger fields at much higher resolution than this .",
    "these images therefore do not fit on a standard computer screen . using a technology similar to , e.g. , google maps",
    ", the mrobs browser allows users to efficiently pan around and zoom in such large , high resolution images .",
    "we here describe in some detail how we have implemented this truly virtual telescope .",
    "first the simulated , multi - wavelength filter images are combined into false - colour rgb composites .",
    "we use the publicly available code ` stiff ` that handles the conversion from arbitrarily large scientific fits input images to standard tiff format output images @xcite . `",
    "stiff ` automatically ( or manually ) applies contrast and brightness adjustments , colour balance and saturation , and gamma corrections producing colour images that are highly informative of the level of detail present in the mono - chromatic input fits images . when we have multiple bands available for any of the three rgb channels ( for example when making colour composites of data sets based on more than three filters ) , we reduce the number of input images to three by creating variance - weighted averages and use those as the input for each channel .    from this high - resolution image",
    "we then create a so - called ` image pyramid ' consisting of representations of this high resolution image at ever decreasing resolution .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyramid ] . the top of the pyramid ( level 0 ) consists of a single @xmath142 pixels low resolution image that is a heavily rebinned version of the original or full - resolution @xmath143 pixels image .",
    "the next level contains @xmath144 image tiles each of @xmath145 times higher resolution compared to the previous level . at the @xmath146th level ( corresponding to the base of the pyramid )",
    ", there will be @xmath147 tiles each representing only a small portion of the original image but now at its highest resolution .",
    "the browser software uses this data format to download only those tiles that at the current zoom level are required to show the image .",
    "this significantly reduces the download time and creates a smooth transition between the different levels or different regions of the image when viewed in a web browser . for example , if we adopt a factor of @xmath148 scalings between levels , tiles of @xmath149 pixels , and an original image of @xmath150 pixels , the last level ( level 7 ) will consist of @xmath151 tiles of @xmath138 pixels .",
    "this means that only about 0.1% of data needs to be downloaded at any time to display a particular region at its fullest resolution on a @xmath152 resolution display .",
    "the mrobs browser offers the user the choice of a large number of image pyramids , based on sets of different mock images , for a variety of virtual telescopes and with different wavelength bands .",
    "each mock image is derived from a light cone stored in the mrdb , and the mrobs browser allows interactive querying of these cones .",
    "screen - shots of an hst simulation viewed through he mrobs browser are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrobs ] . clicking",
    "the image leads to an sql query being submitted to the database that searches for the nearest galaxy to the selected ( virtual ) sky position , up to a maximum radius ( currently 1 ) . if a galaxy is found a large amount of information is retrieved and displayed in a table on the screen next to the image , as shown on the right hand side of the screenshots in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrobs ] .",
    "the selected galaxy is indicated on the image with a little white square ( top panel ) .",
    "the table includes information of the galaxy on the light cone , such as redshift , apparent sizes and luminosities in up to 40 bands .",
    "the observed - frame sed is shown in graphical form above the table .",
    "it also includes , through the linking of the light - cone galaxy to the underlying semi - analytical galaxy catalogues , information about physical parameters such as stellar mass , gas mass , metallicities and rest frame magnitudes in the sdss bands .",
    "the information also includes details about the original dark - matter subhalo and friends - of - friends group the galaxy belongs to .",
    "the latter information can in its turn be used to search for all other galaxies in the image that belong to the same fof group as the selected galaxy . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the positions of all galaxies that were retrieved are indicated on the screen .",
    "the structure turns out to be a galaxy group at @xmath153 .",
    "the query capabilities of the mrobs browser will be extended over time and will be tied to the plain sql query capabilities of the mrdb .",
    "future refinements of the modeling recipes in the mrobs currently in preparation include the calculation of extinctions based on the physically motivated inclinations of galaxies (  [ sec : angles ] ) , as well as the inclusion of strong gravitational lensing based on the distribution of dark matter halos along each lightcone .",
    "although the current simulations span the observed far - uv to the observed near - ir , improvements in the dust - modeling should eventually allow us to construct images out to far - infrared and sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "future simulated surveys will be made available through the mrobs web portal .",
    "ultimately , fully interactive , online versions of the sam , the lightcone generator , and the telescope simulator will allow users of the mrobs even greater flexibility in performing the simulations that best suit their needs .",
    "in order to make predictions in the observational plane and to allow unbiased comparisons between semi - analytic models and real data , we have developed the millennium run observatory ( mrobs ) , a new virtual telescope facility that can be used to simulate realistic observational data based on the semi - analytic model galaxy catalogues associated with the dark matter mr simulations .",
    "the mrobs allows one to produce _ scientific _ image data sets in ` .fits ` format .",
    "these artificial data can be analyzed using the standard tools routinely used for analyzing real observations , allowing a relatively unbiased comparison between sams and real data .",
    "this contrasts with previous studies that compare highly idealized sam predictions to observational data .",
    "the new technique will help  but is by no means limited  to :    * extend the mr simulations project approach by producing data products directly corresponding to observations , namely synthetic images and extracted source catalogs * aid theorists in testing analytical models against observations * aid observers in making detailed predictions for observations and better analyses of observational data * allow the community to subject the models to new kinds of tests * allow detailed comparisons with synthetic observations produced by other groups performing cosmological simulations * allow calibration of observational analysis methods by making available synthetic data for which the entire underlying physical ` reality ' is known .",
    "* extend the realism with which semi - analytic models can address questions such as what is the probability that a @xmath1 galaxy will be detected within a particular observational data set ? * allow one to explore the uniqueness of certain physical models that are based on the analysis of astronomical images , as different models or different parameter sets may produce indistinguishable synthetic observations . * provide a framework for future virtual theoretical observatories    one of the great advantages provided by our extended modeling approach is that for the synthetic observations produced by the mrobs , the physical properties ( e.g. , dark matter halo mass , sfr , stellar mass , size , redshift ) and photometric properties ( e.g. , magnitudes and colours ) of every galaxy are precisely known , in contrast to real observations where one does not know the exact or ` true ' answer .",
    "this makes the mrobs an ideal facility for calibrating many of the measurement and analysis techniques that are applied to real observations .",

    "what does this same cluster look like at @xmath135 or at @xmath5 ?",
    "how is the interpretation of observations of such structures affected by viewing angle or chance superpositions ?",
    "special cones centred on clusters at a range of redshifts have been added to the mrdb for studies of cluster evolution .",

    "the data sets are modeled using two different cosmologies ( wmap1 and wmap7 ) , two spectral synthesis models ( bc03 and m05 ) , and three igm absorption models ( madau , meiksin , and inoue - iwata ) . in specific cases ,",
    "we provide synthetic images that have the exact same geometric and identical noise properties as the reference survey .",
    "the mrobs data can furthermore be explored using an online image browser that allows users to interactively explore the available mock observations .",
    "the browser graphically links objects ( galaxies ) in the synthetic images to various types of information available in catalogs in the mrdb . for each synthetic galaxy",
    ", this information includes the physical properties of their dark matter halos , the intrinsic properties of the galaxy itself , the absolute and apparent photometric properties , and the observed properties recovered from the synthetic images using sextractor .",
    "the public data and the mrobs browser can be accessed at the following url : +    http://galformod.mpa-garching.mpg.de/mrobs/    in conclusion , the mrobs allows us to study our simulated universes through the eyes of our telescopes .",
