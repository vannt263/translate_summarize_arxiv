    "the possible formation of black holes in the early universe has long been discussed .",
    "the idea was first proposed by carr and hawking @xcite , who considered the formation of such primordial black holes ( pbhs ) by the gravitational collapse of density perturbations and their subsequent evolution .",
    "they found that the pbh mass distribution is determined by the initial spectrum of density perturbations and the expansion of the universe , with accretion playing a negligible role .",
    "soon after , hawking discovered that black holes can emit particles @xcite , so that microscopic black holes decay very rapidly .",
    "pbhs smaller than about @xmath0 g would have evaporated by today , while larger ones could have survived .",
    "it has been proposed that these relics could make up the cosmic dark matter @xcite , while on the other hand their non - observation constrains the initial spectrum of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the endpoint of black hole evaporation could be a stable planck - sized remnant @xcite , leading to additional observational consequences @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes have also been considered in the context of extra dimensional theories @xcite . in these theories ,",
    "the fundamental scale of quantum gravity , called @xmath1 , can be as low as @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that with extra dimensions , the properties of microscopic black holes ( those smaller than the size of the extra dimensions ) are significantly altered .",
    "a black hole in extra dimensions will be colder , larger , and longer lived than one of the same mass in four dimensions @xcite , with significant cosmological consequences .",
    "in particular , production of pbhs by the collapse of primordial density perturbations in large extra dimensions has been studied @xcite .",
    "the authors show that the unique properties of extra dimensional black holes lead to a relaxation of the bound on the spectral index .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a different class of pbhs  microscopic black holes produced by high - energy particle collisions in the early universe .",
    "the consequences of these tiny black holes have generally been neglected in the literature , under the premise that they are too hot and short lived to have any observational effects .",
    "we argue that in the presence of extra dimensions , absorbtion of matter from the surrounding plasma can not be neglected , and in fact can lead to rapid growth .",
    "consequently , the production and evolution of these black holes must be analyzed .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the mass density of pbhs is determined by the initial temperature of the universe @xmath3 , the number of extra dimensions @xmath4 , and @xmath1 .",
    "we find that for different values of @xmath4 , large regions of @xmath3@xmath1 parameter space can be excluded by observational constraints .",
    "it is worth noting that the effects of accretion in extra dimensional scenarios have previously been considered @xcite .",
    "these authors analyzed rapidly growing black holes formed by other mechanisms in randall - sundrum cosmologies .",
    "there already exist constraints on theories of large extra dimensions @xcite , the most stringent of which come from astrophysical considerations",
    ". for @xmath5 a natural value of @xmath1 requires an extra dimension whose size is comparable to that of the solar system .",
    "this would lead to obvious conlicts with observation . for @xmath6 the overheating of neutron stars by captured kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons constrains @xmath7 .",
    "larger values of @xmath4 are less tightly constrained .",
    "independent bounds have already been placed by previous authors on the initial temperature of the universe in these theories @xcite .",
    "these are obtained by considering the production of kk gravitons in the early universe .",
    "the kk bounds can always be evaded by considering high enough values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , in which case the gravitons decay too early to have observational consequences .",
    "we demonstrate that in many cases these regions of parameter space are excluded by the pbh bounds .",
    "in addition , the graviton constraints can be evaded by , for example , rapid graviton decay onto another brane or a heavier graviton spectrum arising from a complicated bulk geometry .",
    "for example , starkman , stojkovic and trodden @xcite have argued that all existing astrophysical and cosmological bounds can be evaded if the extra dimensions have the geometry of a compact hyperbolic manifold .",
    "the pbh constraints can not be avoided so easily .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider the model of large extra dimensions proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add ) first presented in @xcite . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "these authors noted that bounds can be placed on the so - called `` normalcy '' temperature of the universe  the temperature below which the extra - dimensional bulk must be stable in size and empty .",
    "in contrast , we constrain the properties of the universe prior to attaining normalcy . we do not specialize to any specific cosmological model .",
    "instead we consider two possible thermal states for the extradimensional bulk without specifiying the dynamics which lead to these states .",
    "we examine scenarios where the bulk is cold and empty , and where it is in thermal equilibrium with the brane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : evo ] we analyze the evolution of a single black hole in the hot primordial plasma . in section  [ sec : prod ] we present a simple model for black hole production in the early universe , and use it to derive bounds on @xmath3 and @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : asmp ] we show that the results we obtain with this simple model apply also to much less restrictive and more realistic scenarios .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in the add model , standard model particles are bound to a three - dimensional brane in a @xmath8-dimensional bulk space .",
    "the black holes relevant to this analysis are created on the brane and remain there .",
    "the brane is populated by a thermal distribution of relativistic standard model particles .",
    "we claim that , in this scenario , a black hole upon its creation will instantaneously ( compared to the timescale of cosmological evolution ) attain a maximum mass . in the case",
    "that the bulk is in thermal equilibrium with the brane , this mass will simply be the mass of a black hole the size of the extra dimension , @xmath9^{n+1}m_*,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 if the bulk is empty of energy density , the mass attained by the black hole depends on the temperature @xmath11 of the universe when the black hole is created and is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 the remainder of this section is devoted to demonstrating this claim .",
    "the properties of black holes in infinitely large extra dimensions were first derived in @xcite . in add ,",
    "the extra dimensions are of finite size ; the four dimensional planck scale  and @xmath1 are related by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "we now review the properties of add black holes as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note that they are only valid for black holes much smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "larger black holes behave effectively four dimensionally .",
    "the schwartzschild radius of an add black hole of mass m is given by @xmath16 the temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath17    we consider a black hole with @xmath18 submerged in a thermal plasma at temperature @xmath19 . if we ignore gravitational attraction , the absorption and emission can both be characterized by the stefann - boltzmann law .",
    "the rate of change of the black hole mass @xmath20 is then @xmath21 here , @xmath22 are the 4 and @xmath23-dimensional stefann - boltzmann constants , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the black hole surface areas on the brane and in the bulk . the number of effective degrees of freedom on the brane is @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the number of polarization states of a bulk graviton .    in the early universe ,",
    "the relationship between time , @xmath28 , and @xmath19 is determined by the friedmann equations .",
    "we will show in the next section that the phase of black hole growth takes place long before matter - radiation equality and that the fraction of the universe s energy density in black holes is small .",
    "radiation domination can therefore be assumed , and @xmath29    for a given temperature there is a threshold mass above which a black hole will absorb more than it emits .",
    "this mass , which we call @xmath30 , is plotted in figure  [ fig : mthresh ] .",
    "it has almost the same value whether the bulk is empty or thermalized .    for",
    ", we can neglect hawking radiation entirely , and equation  [ eq : dmdt ] becomes @xmath31    if the bulk is empty , the second term on the rhs can be dropped .",
    "the resulting equation can be trivially solved to obtain @xmath32^\\frac{n+1}{n-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is given in equation  [ eqn : gamman ] .",
    "this equation takes into account the competition between the growth of the black hole by the accretion of plasma and the cooling of the plasma by the expansion of the universe .",
    "but there is no competition .",
    "because @xmath34 , the second term dominates almost immediately and as the universe cools the mass rapidly approaches the value of @xmath35 given in equation  [ eqn : mmax ] .",
    "this value is plotted as a function of time for different values of @xmath4 in figure  [ fig : branemass ] .",
    "numerical integration confirms that , in the regime considered , hawking radiation is indeed negligible .    in figure",
    "[ fig : growth ] , the evolution of a black hole mass with an empty bulk is depicted .",
    "the almost instantaneous growth to @xmath35 is evident .    in this plot , we take the initial mass @xmath36 .",
    "we find , however , that the rapid growth depicted occurs even for initial masses extremely close to @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , initial masses even slightly less than @xmath30 lead to rapid decay of the black hole .",
    "now consider the opposite case in which the bulk is in thermal equilibrium with the brane .",
    "for simplicity , consider integrating equation  [ dmdt_abs ] with the second term only .",
    "once again the equation can be solved to obtain @xmath37^{-(n+1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 this solution will formally diverge after a finite time if @xmath39 it should be noted that @xmath40 is typically much smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the actual threshold for rapid growth of a black hole in the presence of a thermalized bulk is always given by @xmath30 .",
    "we can also ask how quickly the mass of the black hole grows .",
    "the temperature of the universe corresponding to the time when the black hole mass diverges is @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{n+2}}.\\ ] ] from an inspection of equation  [ mdiv ] it is clear that for @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "thus the second term in equation [ eq : tdiv ] is much smaller than one and the black hole mass diverges almost immediately .    of course",
    ", the mass of the black hole does not actually diverge .",
    "in fact , once its size reaches that of the extra dimension the black hole begins behaving four - dimensionally and , as we will see below , the absorption effectively shuts off , so the black hole remains at @xmath44 as claimed .",
    "we have seen that for both an empty and a thermalized bulk the evolution of a microscopic black hole in the early universe can be characterized by a threshold initial mass above which the pbh will rapidly grow and below which it will decay away . in each case",
    "any rapidly growing black hole reaches a uniform maximum mass @xmath35 which is shown in table  [ tab : mmax ] for different values of @xmath4 for both the empty and thermalized bulk .",
    ".the maximum mass , in @xmath45 , of a rapidly growing black hole for @xmath46 .",
    "the two rows correspond to an empty and thermalized bulk .",
    "for the empty bulk @xmath11 is taken to be @xmath47 tev . for the thermalized bulk the values are independent of temperature . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as was noted in the previous sections , the exact properties of extra dimensional black holes of mass close to the fundamental planck scale are rather poorly understood .",
    "specifically , there is no consensus regarding the production cross section or the exact spectrum of hawking radiation .",
    "so far , we have used the canonical choice of @xmath48 and a purely thermal spectrum . in doing so",
    ", we have neglected the effects of angular momentum and the dissipation of energy through gravitational waves in particle collisions .",
    "we have also ignored radiative gray - body factors .",
    "as previously mentioned , the black hole production cross section is given by @xmath49 the factor @xmath50 depends on the center of mass energy , the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the interacting particles ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typical values for @xmath50 can reach as low as @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , the total energy actually trapped behind the black hole event horizon is not necessarily @xmath52 , as we have assumed .",
    "studies have concluded that only approximately @xmath53 of the collision center of mass energy actually forms the black hole , with the rest escaping in the form of gravitational radiation .",
    "also , a black hole created with a high initial angular momentum will undergo a rapid `` spin - down '' phase during which it will shed its angular momentum and a significant fraction of its mass @xcite .",
    "this effect could result in an even lower initial mass of the schwartzschild black hole .    as we have seen , however , the black hole mass density is exquisitely sensitive to the initial temperature .",
    "an order one modification of the cross section will thus have a negligible effect on the bounds on @xmath3 .",
    "the percentage of energy converted to black hole mass will affect the number of such black holes which are created above the threshold for rapid growth , and thus the final pbh mass density .",
    "but , once again , a tiny modification of the intial temperature would compensate for this effect , leaving the final bounds essentially unchanged .",
    "the correction to the spectrum of hawking radiation due to gray - body factors , because it could modify the black hole lifetime , could change the location of the kinks and cutoffs in figure  [ fig : bound ] , but would not qualitatively alter our conclusions .",
    "many authors have explored the possibility that black holes do not evaporate away completely but leave behind a microscopic remnant .",
    "this remnant is typically of the fundamental mass , which in large extra dimensions is @xmath1 .",
    "black hole remnants have been proposed in various contexts .",
    "adler , chen and santiago @xcite argued that the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle must be generalized in the presence of a curved space - time , causing hawking radiation to shut off once the black hole reaches the fundamental scale .",
    "rizzo @xcite investigated the thermodynamics of black holes in the presence of higher curvature gravity and found that the specific heat of these black holes can become positive .",
    "the black hole would then cool as it evaporates , asymptoting to a finite size .",
    "we have incorporated the possibility of black hole remnants by extending the bounds of integration of equation [ eq : bhr ] .",
    "originally we integrated over mass values between @xmath30 and @xmath54 while assuming that , below @xmath30 , the black holes would decay away . with remnants , we should extend the region of integration down to the quantum gravity limit , taken to be several times the fundamental scale .",
    "to each black hole created below @xmath30 we assign a final mass @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting bounds on @xmath3 are approximately @xmath55 orders of magnitude lower than those displayed in figure  [ fig : bound ] and cover the entire range in @xmath1 for all values of @xmath4 for both a full and empty bulk .",
    "the bounds are sensitive to the value of the remnant mass .",
    "lowering this mass below @xmath1 can substantially strengthen the bounds on @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new constraint on cosmological models in theories of large extra dimensions , stemming from the production of rapidly growing microscopic black holes in the very early universe .",
    "we found that generic upper bounds can be placed on the temperature of the universe in any post inflationary epoch .",
    "as an example we analyzed two simple cases , that of a completely empty bulk and a bulk that is fully thermalized with the standard model brane .",
    "we found that in both cases significant regions of @xmath56 parameter space can be excluded .",
    "notably , these bounds are not sensitive to many of the details relating to black holes at the classical - quantum threshold .",
    "this eliminates one of the main sources of uncertainty which plague typical studies of black holes in extra dimensions .",
    "when compared to existing bounds , we showed that the pbh constraints are stronger for high values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in the previously mentioned scenarios where the bulk is depopulated , the graviton bounds are weakened even further . on the other hand , at low values of these parameters ,",
    "our bounds are generally weaker .",
    "this is because while the cross section for black hole production is large , only sufficiently massive ones are long - lived . at low temperatures ,",
    "these represent a small fraction of the black holes produced . even if one includes the possibility of remnants , the black hole mass is bounded from below by the quantum gravity threshold . for temperatures",
    "much lower than @xmath1 very few will be produced above this limit .",
    "although we focused on specific examples , it is important to note that the phenomenon of primordial black hole production and subsequent growth is generic . in any theory of extra dimensions where the fundamental planck scale is low",
    ", a large enough energy density will lead to this effect .",
    "generalizations of our simple scenario could include for example non - thermal brane particle distributions , a range of bulk thermal states , and a non - static bulk radius . rapidly growing microscopic black holes in the early universe represent a conceptually new phenomenon which should be considered in detail .",
