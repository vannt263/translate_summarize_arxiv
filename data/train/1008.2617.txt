    "in  @xcite a three - loop computation of the ghost propagator was presented .",
    "as announced , we now report on a similar computation of the gluon propagator .",
    "the full propagators of gluons and ghosts calculated on the lattice encode information about the non - perturbative vacuum properties of qcd and of pure yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "this requires a non - perturbative extension of the landau gauge .",
    "although brst invariance is essential for other non - perturbative approaches to non - abelian gauge theory , there are principal difficulties to reconcile it with present - day lattice gauge fixing technology ( as applied for calculating gauge - variant objects like gluon and ghost propagators ) in a way avoiding the neuberger problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so far , there is no generally accepted way to deal with the gribov ambiguity in lattice simulations .",
    "other non - perturbative methods for calculations in the landau gauge like schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations  @xcite or the functional renormalization group ( frg )  @xcite are not explicitly taking into account ( and seem not to be affected by ) the complication compared to the standard faddeev - popov procedure that the functional integration should be restricted to the gribov horizon .",
    "zwanziger has argued  @xcite that the form of the sd equations will not be affected .",
    "rather supplementary conditions restricting solutions should account for it .",
    "the so - called scaling solution  @xcite has been an early result of the sd approach obtained for power - like solutions .",
    "the power behavior has been further specified in  @xcite and confirmed by ( time - independent ) stochastic quantization  @xcite .",
    "concerning lattice simulations , zwanziger proposed  @xcite to add nonlocal terms to the action that should control the simulation to stay within the gribov horizon   has been obtained . ] . in the context of the schwinger - dyson approach",
    "this possibility has been analytically discussed first in ref .",
    "standard monte carlo simulations without these refinements have failed to reproduce the theoretically preferred far - infrared asymptotics of the scaling solution and have supported instead the so - called decoupling solution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this solution has later been shown to be possible in the sd and frg approaches with suitable boundary conditions  @xcite , but at the expense of a conflict with global brst invariance .",
    "although we can assume that nspt remains in the vicinity of the trivial vacuum , we have to understand the present situation with respect to monte carlo results for gluon and ghost propagators .",
    "fortunately , the momentum range we are interested in and where we are going to compare with monte carlo lattice results is not influenced by the gribov ambiguity and the way of gauge fixing  @xcite . from various studies",
    "it is known , however , that the intermediate momentum range of @xmath3 is not less important from the point of view of confinement physics , as seen for the gluon propagator  @xcite and the quark propagator  @xcite in landau gauge on the lattice . from the frg approach",
    "it is known that for the onset of confinement at finite temperature the mid - momentum region of the propagators is important  @xcite .",
    "this is the region where violation of positivity  @xcite invalidates a conventional , particle - like interpretation of the gluon propagator .",
    "specific non - perturbative configurations ( center vortices ) have been found to be essential  @xcite to understand the behavior of the gluon and the quark propagator in the intermediate momentum range .    in recent years",
    ", also the large - momentum behavior of the lattice gluon and ghost propagators has attracted growing interest , in particular with respect to the coupling constant of the ghost - gluon vertex  @xcite , which has the potential to provide an independent precision measurement of @xmath4 from these propagators  @xcite .",
    "first estimates of the zero- and two - flavor values of @xmath5  @xcite and a possible dimension - two condensate  @xcite are available already and look promising . therefore",
    ", a detailed knowledge of the propagators lattice perturbative part would much foster these efforts .    when our work begun in 2007  @xcite ,",
    "the intention was to clarify the perturbative background , among other facts the type of convergence of the summed - up few - loop perturbative contributions to the propagators in various momentum ranges .",
    "in standard lattice perturbation theory ( lpt ) such calculations are very difficult beyond two - loop order . to overcome this obstacle ,",
    "we have used the method of numerical stochastic perturbation theory ( nspt )  @xcite , which provides a stochastic , automatized framework for gauge - invariant and gauge - non - invariant calculations .",
    "stochastic gauge fixing is built in , and a high - precision procedure has been devised to fix the gauge to landau , at any given order .",
    "thus , the propagators ( for each lattice momentum ) can be calculated in subsequent orders of perturbation theory .",
    "a limit is set only by storage limitations and machine precision .",
    "there are no truncation errors . for direct comparison with monte carlo results , we present the low - loop results summed up with inverse powers of the bare inverse coupling @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we also try , for the first time applied to the gluon propagator , to improve the convergence by applying boosted perturbation theory .",
    "the effectiveness of nspt relies on the fact that the parametrization of the ( leading and non - leading ) logarithmic terms can follow largely in accordance with standard perturbation theory .",
    "the essential difficulty left to nspt is the computation of the constant contributions , which are in general very difficult to achieve in diagrammatic lpt .    only the one - loop constant term was known since long  @xcite for the ghost and gluon propagator . reproducing these results , which are obtained in the continuum and infinite - volume limits ,",
    "was the first feasibility test for nspt  @xcite .    in general , at any order ,",
    "nspt results are obtained at finite lattice spacing and finite volume .",
    "a fitting procedure is needed to get the continuum ( @xmath1 ) and infinite - volume ( @xmath2 ) limits .",
    "while the extraction of the first ( continuum ) limit relies on hypercubic - invariant taylor series  @xcite , a careful extraction of the second ( infinite - volume ) limit requires the accounting of @xmath7 contributions ( @xmath8 being the momentum scale relevant to the computation and @xmath9 the finite extent of the lattice ) . in the first paper ( abbreviated as i )",
    ", we gave a quite comprehensive description of all this technology while applying it to the ghost propagator . in the present , second paper",
    "we are going to apply the method to an analysis of the gluon propagator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : gluonprop - formulation ] recalls the lattice definition of the gluon propagator , together with specific features that the calculation in the framework of nspt contains .",
    "[ sec : standard - lpt ] contains the nomenclature of standard lattice perturbation theory where our results have to fit in . in sect .",
    "[ sec : implementation ] we only briefly describe the implementation of nspt . the interested reader will find more information of this kind in part i of this series of papers .",
    "however , we document the statistics for different lattice volumes and different orders of perturbation theory that has been collected by the leipzig and parma part of the collaboration . here",
    "we also present the raw data before and after the extrapolation to the langevin time - step @xmath10 limit . in sect .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we compare the results of nspt ( up to four loops ) with monte carlo results and try to improve the convergence by boosted perturbation theory .",
    "[ sec : fitting ] presents the fitting procedure and the final results for the leading and non - leading loop corrections . in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we draw our conclusions and summarize our results .",
    "the lattice gluon propagator @xmath11 is the fourier transform of the gluon two - point function , _",
    "i.e. _ the expectation value @xmath12 which is required to be color - diagonal and symmetric in the lorentz indices @xmath13 . for the definition of the lattice momenta @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 to be used later",
    "we refer to ( i-17)-(i-19 ) .    assuming reality of the color components of the vector potential and rotational invariance of the two - point function",
    ", the continuum gluon propagator has the following general tensor structure   denotes here directly the continuum euclidean four - momentum . ]",
    "@xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the transverse and longitudinal propagator , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal propagator @xmath19 vanishes in the landau gauge .",
    "the lattice gluon propagator @xmath20 depends on the lattice four - momentum @xmath21 . due to the lower symmetry of the hypercubic group",
    "its general tensor structure can be expected to be more complicated than  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) that holds in the continuum . inspired by the continuum form  ( [ eq : decomposition ] )",
    "we consider as one strategy only the extraction of the following lattice scalars @xmath22 that should survive the continuum limit .",
    "note , however , that additional lattice scalars could be measured as well . the first scalar vanishes exactly in lattice landau gauge . in this gauge the second scalar function , corresponding to the transverse part of the gluon propagator in the continuum limit , is denoted by @xmath23 on the lattice , this function is influenced by the the lower symmetry of the hypercubic group .    in nspt",
    "the different loop orders @xmath24 ( even orders in @xmath25 ) at finite langevin step size @xmath26 are constructed directly from the fourier transformed perturbative gauge fields @xmath27 with ( see ( i-6 ) and ( i-7 ) ) @xmath28 what leads to @xmath29 \\",
    ",    \\right\\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : dn}\\ ] ]    note that already the tree - level contribution to the gluon propagator , @xmath30 , arises from quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields with @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , terms with non - integer @xmath32 in the previous equation ( [ eq : dn ] )  which do not correspond to loop contributions  should vanish numerically after averaging over configurations .",
    "similar to the ghost propagator in paper i , we present the various orders of the gluon dressing function ( or `` form factor '' ) in two forms : @xmath33 contrary to the ghost propagator the gluon dressing function can be calculated at the same time for all possible four - momenta given by four integers  the four - momentum tuples @xmath34 .",
    "this makes a calculation of the gluon propagator significantly cheaper .",
    "the tree - level result for the dressing function , @xmath35 in the limit @xmath36 for all sets of tuples is non - trivial and is obtained as the result of averaging .",
    "as discussed in paper i  we relate infrared singularities encountered in our finite volume nspt calculation to powers of logarithms of the external momentum obtained in the infinite volume limit .",
    "therefore , we need the anomalous dimension of the gluon field @xmath37 , the @xmath38-function and the relation between lattice bare and renormalized coupling . the procedure is outlined in detail in section 4 of i. here , we only repeat the essential equations and quote the final numbers . to avoid a possible mismatch of equations we add an index @xmath39 for the gluon propagator case .    in the ri-mom scheme ,",
    "the renormalized gluon dressing function @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 with the standard condition @xmath42 the gluon dressing function @xmath43 is the gluon wave function renormalization constant @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the expansions of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath40 in terms of the renormalized coupling @xmath48 are completely analogous to ( i-39)-(i-41 ) .",
    "the gluon wave function renormalization as an expansion in the lattice coupling @xmath49 is represented as @xmath50 this is the expansion we can measure in nspt .",
    "again we restrict ourselves to three - loop expressions for the landau gauge in the quenched approximation .",
    "the coefficients in front of the logarithms are partly known from calculations of the gluon wave functions and the beta function in the continuum and given as follows ( compare _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath51 \\ , n_c^3    - \\frac{1279}{108 } \\ , z^{g,\\rm ri'}_{1,0}\\ , n_c^2    + \\frac{31}{3 } \\",
    ", z^{g,\\rm ri'}_{2,0}\\ , n_c\\ , .    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the finite one - loop constant @xmath52 is known from the gluon self energy in standard infinite volume lpt  @xcite with the value @xmath53 again the constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 were not known so far .",
    "the form of the coefficients @xmath56 of @xmath57 in ( [ zabare ] ) up to three loops can be read off directly from equations ( i-51)-(i-53 ) replacing there all @xmath58 by @xmath56 .    as a result",
    ", we present the gluon dressing function as function of the inverse lattice coupling @xmath38 to that order @xmath59 with the one - loop coefficients @xmath60 the two - loop coefficients @xmath61 and the three - loop coefficients @xmath62 let us repeat it once more : the leading logarithmic coefficients for a given order can be exclusively taken from continuum perturbative calculations .",
    "the non - leading log coefficients are influenced , however , by the finite lattice constants from corresponding lower loop orders .",
    "to obtain infinite volume perturbative loop results at vanishing lattice spacing , we have to study again the limit @xmath36 and different lattice sizes @xmath63 .",
    "we have used @xmath64 and @xmath65 and studied the maximal loop order for the propagator @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the accumulated statistics for the different @xmath26 s and lattice sizes are collected in tables  [ tab : statistics ] and  [ tab : statistics2 ] .",
    ".number of gluon propagator measurements up to four loops ( @xmath68 ) and up to one loop ( @xmath69 ) using the leipzig nspt code . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the errors are estimated by equally weighting the mean deviations squared of both the individual fits and the sum of the `` best '' ten @xmath70 values .",
    "the results from the different criteria coincide within errors .",
    "we have obtained a very good agreement at the level of 0.5 percent with the expected exact one - loop result @xmath71 given in  ( [ jg1loop ] ) .",
    "comparing the accuracy reached here with that of the ghost propagator , let us mention again that in the gluon propagator case already the tree level is calculated from quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields .",
    "so the one - loop accuracy in the gluon dressing function case should be fairly compared to the two - loop accuracy of the ghost dressing function .    to estimate the influence of the missing larger volumes for the three - loop constant ,",
    "let us compare the two - loop constants obtained in the lattice volume sets ( @xmath72 ) ( one- and two - loop ) and ( @xmath73 ) ( three - loop ) .",
    "the results are collected in table  [ tab : fitcomp ] .",

    "this has to be taken into account as a systematic effect in our estimate of @xmath77 .",
    "finally we decided to take the selection criterion @xmath78 as the most suitable one and present our numerical results for the unknown non - logarithmic constants in the gluon dressing function of infinite volume lattice perturbation theory in landau gauge : @xmath79 collecting all results we can write ( [ zgluonbeta3loop ] ) in a numerical form ( restricting to at most five digits after the decimal point ) @xmath80 a transformation to the @xmath81 scheme can be performed using the relations given in section  [ sec : standard - lpt ] .",
    "in the present work we have applied nspt to calculate the landau gauge gluon propagator in lattice perturbation theory up to four loops . the summed gluon dressing function",
    "is compared to recent monte carlo measurements of the berlin humboldt university group .",
    "both ( nspt ) perturbative and non - perturbative results are in terms of one and the same definition of the gauge fields , both in landau gauge fixing and in measurements of the propagator . to improve the comparison , we have also summed our results in a boosted scheme showing better convergence properties .",
    "the key goal of the lattice study of propagators is to reveal their genuinely non - perturbative content , which asks for disentangling perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the commonly used procedure goes through the fit of the high momentum tail by continuum - like formulae ( anomalous dimensions and logarithms can be taken from continuum computation ) .",
    "while this lets us gain intuition , it opens the way to further ambiguities , since irrelevant effects give substantial contributions to the perturbative tail . at large lattice momenta",
    "our calculations indicate that the perturbative dressing function constructed by means of nspt with more than four loops will match the monte carlo measurements , thus enabling a fair accounting of the perturbative tail .",
    "the strong difference which is left over in the intermediate and  moreover  the infrared momentum region should then be attributed to non - perturbative effects .",
    "power corrections  @xcite and contributions from non - perturbative excitations  @xcite are serious candidates for the description of these ( better disentangled ) effects .",
    "the one - loop result for the perturbative gluon propagator of lattice @xmath0 in covariant gauges ( and in particular landau ) has been known for a long time . using our strategy for a careful analysis of finite volume and finite lattice size effects we find good agreement with this result . in ( [ j3gloopnum ] )",
