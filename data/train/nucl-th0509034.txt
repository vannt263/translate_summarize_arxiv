    "the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the description of the three - nucleon continuum is one of the most challenging tasks in theoretical few - body nuclear physics  @xcite . whereas it has already been solved for elastic proton - deuteron @xmath2 scattering with realistic hadronic interactions using various procedures @xcite",
    ", there are only very few attempts @xcite to calculate @xmath3 breakup , and none of them uses a complete treatment of the coulomb interaction and realistic hadronic potentials allowing for a stringent comparison with the experimental data .    recently in ref .  @xcite we included the coulomb interaction between the protons in the description of three - nucleon reactions with two - body initial and final states .",
    "the description is based on the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equation  @xcite in momentum space . the coulomb potential is screened and the resulting scattering amplitudes are corrected by the renormalization technique of refs .",
    "@xcite to recover the unscreened limit .",
    "the treatment is applicable to any two - nucleon potential without separable expansion .",
    "reference @xcite and this paper use the purely nucleonic charge - dependent ( cd ) bonn potential @xcite and its coupled - channel extension cd bonn + @xmath1 @xcite , allowing for a single virtual @xmath1-isobar excitation and fitted to the experimental data with the same degree of accuracy as cd bonn itself .",
    "in the three - nucleon system the @xmath1 isobar mediates an effective three - nucleon force and effective two- and three - nucleon currents , both consistent with the underlying two - nucleon force .",
    "the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite is technically highly successful , but still limited to the description of proton - deuteron @xmath2 elastic scattering and of electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "reactions involving @xmath4 with @xmath3 initial or final states only .",
    "this paper extends the treatment of coulomb to breakup in @xmath3 scattering and to e.m .",
    "three - body disintegration of @xmath4 . in that extension",
    "we follow the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite , but avoid approximations on the hadronic potential and in the treatment of screened coulomb .",
    "thus , our three - particle equations , including the screened coulomb potential , are completely different from the quasiparticle equations solved in ref .",
    "@xcite where the two - nucleon screened coulomb transition matrix is approximated by the screened coulomb potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented for the first time a limited set of results for @xmath3 breakup using the same technical developments we explain here in greater detail .",
    "we have to recall that the screened coulomb potential @xmath5 we work with is particular .",
    "it is screened around the separation @xmath6 between two charged baryons and in configuration space is given by @xmath7 with the true coulomb potential @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the fine structure constant and @xmath10 controlling the smoothness of the screening .",
    "we prefer to work with a sharper screening than the yukawa screening @xmath11 of ref .",
    "we want to ensure that the screened coulomb potential @xmath5 approximates well the true coulomb one @xmath12 for distances @xmath13 and simultaneously vanishes rapidly for @xmath14 , providing a comparatively fast convergence of the partial - wave expansion .",
    "in contrast , the sharp cutoff @xmath15 yields an unpleasant oscillatory behavior in the momentum - space representation , leading to convergence problems .",
    "we find the values @xmath16 to provide a sufficiently smooth , but at the same time a sufficiently rapid screening around @xmath6 like in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath17 is our choice for the results of this paper .",
    "the screening radius @xmath18 is chosen much larger than the range of the strong interaction which is of the order of the pion wavelength @xmath19 . nevertheless , the screened coulomb potential @xmath5 is of short range in the sense of scattering theory .",
    "standard scattering theory is therefore applicable .",
    "a reliable technique @xcite for solving the ags equation  @xcite with short - range interactions is extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to include the screened coulomb potential between the charged baryons .",
    "however , the partial - wave expansion of the pair interaction requires much higher angular momenta than the one of the strong two - nucleon potential alone .",
    "the screening radius @xmath18 will always remain very small compared with nuclear screening distances of atomic scale , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the employed screened coulomb potential @xmath5 is unable to simulate properly the physics of nuclear screening and , even more , all features of the true coulomb potential .",
    "thus , the approximate breakup calculations with screened coulomb @xmath5 have to be corrected for their shortcomings in a controlled way .",
    "references  @xcite give the prescription for the correction procedure which we follow here for breakup as we did previously for elastic scattering , and that involves the renormalization of the on - shell amplitudes in order to get the proper unscreened coulomb limit .",
    "after the indicated corrections , the predictions for breakup observables have to show independence from the choice of the screening radius @xmath18 , provided it is chosen sufficiently large . that convergence will be the internal criterion for the reliability of our coulomb treatment .",
    "configuration space treatments of coulomb @xcite may provide a viable alternative to the integral equation approach in momentum space on which this paper is based .",
    "references @xcite have provided first results for @xmath3 breakup , but they still involve approximations in the treatment of coulomb and the employed hadronic dynamics is not realistic .",
    "thus , a benchmark comparison between our breakup results and corresponding configuration space results is , in contrast to @xmath3 elastic scattering @xcite , not possible yet . with respect to the reliability of our coulomb treatment for breakup ,",

    "the full resolvent therefore also yields the desired @xmath40 matrix for breakup .",

    "@xcite for treating the screened coulomb transition matrix in high partial waves .",
    "this would not be possible , if we had used yukawa screening as in ref .",
    "@xcite for two reasons : ( a ) the convergence with respect to screening would require much larger radii @xmath18 ; ( b ) the larger values of @xmath18 would necessitate the solution of the ags equation with much higher angular momentum states .",
    "\\(4 ) our method for including the coulomb interaction is efficient .",
    "though the number of the isospin triplet partial waves to be taken into account is considerably higher than in the case without coulomb , the required computing time increases only by a factor of 3  4 for each screening radius @xmath18 , due to the use of perturbation theory for high partial waves .",
    "the obtained results are fully converged with respect to the screening and with respect to the quantum number cutoffs ; they are therefore well checked for their validity .",
    "the employed technique gets cumbersome in kinematical regions with very low relative @xmath24 energy , i.e. , @xmath24 c.m .",

    "disintegration of @xmath4 is extremely important in kinematical regimes close to @xmath24-fsi .",
    "there the @xmath24 repulsion converts the @xmath24-fsi peak obtained in the absence of coulomb into a minimum with zero cross section .",
    "this significant change of the cross section behavior has important consequences in nearby configurations where one may observe instead an increase of the cross section due to coulomb .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of the beam energy and depends solely on specific momentum distributions of the three - nucleon final state .",
    "therefore , unlike in @xmath3 elastic scattering where the coulomb contribution decreases with the beam energy until it gets confined to the forward direction , in three - body breakup large coulomb effects may always be found in specific configurations besides @xmath24-fsi , even at high beam energies .",
    "another important consequence of this work is that we can finally ascertain with greater confidence the quality of two- and three - nucleon force models one uses to describe @xmath3 observables ; any disagreement with high quality @xmath3 data may now be solely attributed to the underlying nuclear interaction . in the framework of the present study we reanalyzed the contribution of @xmath1-isobar degrees of freedom to three - body breakup observables .",
    "the largest @xmath1 effects take place in analyzing powers for given configurations .",
    "nevertheless the lack of high quality analyzing power data on a broad spectrum of configurations prevents a full evaluation of the @xmath1 effects in @xmath3 breakup .",
    "the situation is even worse in three - body photodisintegration of @xmath4 , where there are neither kinematically complete experiments without polarization nor any analyzing power data available .",
