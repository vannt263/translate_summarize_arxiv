    "this project is devoted to the computer algebra experimentation in the area of algebraic graph theory , the part of mathematics on the edge between graph theory , linear algebra , and group theory .",
    "the main objects of interest in algebraic graph theory are highly symmetric graphs , where level of symmetry might be measured both on group - theoretical and purely combinatorial levels .",
    "two books @xcite and @xcite reflect impressive progress in this part of mathematics .    nowadays computer algebra tools , and especially gap ( groups , algorithms , programming - a system for computational discrete algebra @xcite ) , together with a few of its share packages , become an inalienable part of modern graph theory and combinatorics . a  significant portion of striking combinatorial structures",
    "was discovered and analyzed with the aid of a computer .",
    "the main subject of interest in the presented text are directed strongly regular graphs ( briefly dsrgs ) , a natural generalization of a classical ( in algebraic graph theory ) concept from simple to directed graphs .",
    "the concept of a dsrg was suggested and investigated by a.  duval in @xcite . for a while it remained unnoticed , however , during last 15 years this class of structures is becoming more and more popular .",
    "the initial concept of a strongly regular graph ( briefly srg ) has a number of relatively independent origins of interest in such diverse areas like design of statistical experiments , finite geometries , applied permutation groups , and also complexity theory of algorithms .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that srgs are usually regarded as most sophisticated structures for the problems of isomorphism testing of graphs and determination of the automorphism group of graphs .",
    "the main combinatorial invariant of a srg is its parameter set , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "typically , classification of srgs is arranged for each parameter set separately .",
    "similar situation is also observed for dsrgs .",
    "however , these structures appear even more frequently .",
    "for example , while there are 36 parameter sets for srgs on up to 50 vertices , this number is 225 for dsrgs . on the other hand ,",
    "the central problems of the identification of dsrgs and determination of their symmetry are on the same level of difficulty as it appears for the classical case of strongly regular graphs .    in this context , dsrgs provide , in comparison with srgs much more wide training polygons for the experts in the complexity theory which allows more diversity ( undirected versus directed ) for investigated graphs .",
    "the previous experience ( earned , in particular , by m. klin and his coauthors ) shows that a clever use of computers helps to discover new examples of dsrgs and after that to reach an honest theoretical generalization of the detected structures .",
    "this line of activity stimulated the authors to join their efforts in a new attempt .",
    "at this stage , we are concentrating on the association schemes as possible origins of new dsrgs .",
    "namely , we wish to consider any association scheme @xmath0 , for which a suitable union of classes provides a dsrg , preferably new , moreover , with a new parameter set .",
    "this text is an extended version of a paper ( with the same title ) to appear soon in a special volume ( casc 2014 ) of lncs series .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "the necessary basic notions are introduced . in section  3 , we describe our approach to the problem of finding new directed strongly regular graphs using computer algebra experimentation . in section  4 ,",
    "the mentioned strategies are explained with enough rigorous details and the results of different approaches are reported . in section  5 , the results of a classical strategy using cayley graphs are submitted .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and summary of new graphs , being discovered .",
    "information , provided in the appendix , allows one to reconstruct ( with the aid of a computer ) all new dsrgs discovered by us .",
    "below we present brief account of most significant concepts exploited in the paper .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for more information .      a _ simple graph _",

    "edges_.    a _ directed graph _ ( briefly digraph ) @xmath1 is a pair @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the set of _ vertices _ and @xmath6 is a binary relation on @xmath3 , that is a subset of the set @xmath7 of all ordered pairs of elements in @xmath3 .",
    "the pairs in @xmath6 are called _ directed arcs _ or _",
    "darts_. the vertex set of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath8 and the dart set is denoted by @xmath9 .    a _ balanced incomplete block design _ ( bibd ) is a pair @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the point set of cardinality @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a collection of @xmath14 @xmath15-subsets of @xmath11 ( _ blocks _ ) such that each element of @xmath11 is contained in exactly @xmath16 blocks and any 2-subset of @xmath3 is contained in exactly @xmath17 blocks .",
    "the numbers @xmath18 , and @xmath17 are _ parameters _ of the bibd . from the parameters @xmath19",
    "the remaining two are determined uniquely , therefore , we use just the triplet of parameters @xmath20 for a bibd .    for any finite group @xmath21 , the _ group ring _",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the set of all formal sums of elements of @xmath21 , with coefficients from @xmath23 .",

    "the element @xmath25 in @xmath22 is called a _ simple quantity _ , and it is denoted as @xmath26 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the identity element of the group @xmath21 .",
    "then the digraph @xmath29 with vertex set @xmath21 and dart set @xmath30 is called the _ cayley digraph over @xmath21 with respect to  @xmath24 .",
    "_      a graph @xmath1 with adjacency matrix @xmath31 is called _ regular _ , if there exists a positive integer @xmath15 such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the all - one matrix . the number @xmath15 is called _ valency _ of @xmath1 . a simple regular graph with valency @xmath15",

    "the quadruple @xmath38 is called the _ parameter set _ of an srg @xmath1 .      a possible generalization of the notion of srgs for directed graphs was given by duval  @xcite . while the family of srgs has been well - studied in the algebraic graph theory cf .",

    "a dsrg with @xmath44 is an srg , and a dsrg with @xmath45 is a doubly regular tournament . throughout the paper",
    "we consider only dsrgs satisfying @xmath46 , which are called _ genuine _ dsrgs .",

    "let @xmath56 denote the digraph obtained by reversing all the darts in @xmath1 .",

    "the coherent configurations which appear in this manner are called _ schurian _ , otherwise _ non - schurian_.    an _ association scheme _",
    "@xmath97 is a _ homogeneous _ coherent configuration , i.e. , where the diagonal relation @xmath98 does belong to @xmath71 .",
    "hence , a very important source of association schemes are transitive permutation groups , since their 2-orbits form a homogeneous coherent configuration .",
    "let @xmath0 be a coherent configuration of rank @xmath16 .",
    "to each relation @xmath82 in @xmath0 we can assign a 01-matrix @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",

    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of these concepts .",
    "graphs and digraphs can be regarded as binary relations , while association schemes are collections of binary relations in the sense of our definition .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask :    * question 1 . *",
    "assume @xmath0 is an association scheme of order @xmath40 .",
    "can we obtain a dsrg on @xmath40 vertices as a union of suitable classes in @xmath0 ?",
    "it turns out that there is no standard easy way to reply to the question .",
    "a very important necessary condition posed for the initial association scheme @xmath0 was given in @xcite :    let @xmath1 be a genuine directed strongly regular graph .",
    "then the coherent closure @xmath125 is non - commutative , and its rank is at least @xmath126 .    in other words , we have to consider non - commutative association schemes of rank at least 6 , when we are searching for directed strongly regular graphs as unions of relations in a prescribed association scheme",
    ".    significant part of our results was achieved following the strategy of creating suitable non - commutative association schemes and taking unions of their relations .",
    "assume that @xmath127 is an association scheme and @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the rank of @xmath129 , thus , @xmath0 has @xmath130 classes . in many cases below , @xmath92",
    "acts transitively on @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is the schurian scheme obtained from permutation group @xmath91 , however , this restriction is not obligatory in the framework of the described approach .",
    "let @xmath1 be a putative dsrg ( with order @xmath40 ) , which is obtained via union of suitable classes of @xmath0 .",
    "then clearly one has to inspect @xmath132 possible unions .",
    "first evident restriction is to look simultaneously for all possible parameter sets of dsrgs of order @xmath40 ; recall that this data is available at @xcite .",
    "typically , in this project , our attention was restricted only to the open parameter sets .    at the second step",
    ", one has to consider multisets of valencies of symmetric and antisymmetric classes in @xmath0 and to find in advance which subsets of classes of @xmath0 may in principle provide a mixed graph with prescribed pair of valencies @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "getting such a list is a simple case of the famous knapsack problem , however , we were using a very naive approach to provide all solutions .    in order to eliminate in further search duplicates of isomorphic graphs",
    "it might be helpful to work with the representatives of orbits on sets of relations in the action of the color group @xmath115 .",
    "sometimes , preliminary sorting with the aid of the action of the algebraic group @xmath116 might be also of help . nevertheless , according to the gathered practical experience , in most of the cases",
    "the order of @xmath116 is relatively small , thus , we are facing exponential complexity in cases of schemes with relatively small valencies .",
    "therefore , we decided to restrict our systematic attempts just to the association schemes of rank not larger than 25 .    finally , for each selected `` suspicious '' union of relations from @xmath0 we have to check whether it is providing a dsrg or not . here",
    "use of the known structure constants of @xmath0 is very crucial : indeed , instead of inspection of the adjacency matrix @xmath134 of a putative graph @xmath1 we arrange calculations with the tensor of structure constants of @xmath0 .",
    "the computational scheme outlined above is , in a sense , the ideal plan of activities , which were arranged in the course of computations . in many cases",
    ", we preferred to use ingredients of a brute - force approach , rather than to being involved in a more sophisticated programming . since in many cases it was impossible to execute an exhaustive search , it was substituted by an ad hoc selection of simple `` promising '' subsets of candidates .",
    "we run all computations in the software gap @xcite with its share packages grape @xcite together with nauty @xcite for computation with graphs ; an unpublished package coco - ii @xcite written by s. reichard for computations with association schemes and coherent configurations ; and the package setorbit @xcite written by ch .",
    "pech and s. reichard , and documented in @xcite , for finding representatives of orbits of group actions on sets of various size .",
    "in addition , some ad hoc computational tricks were used from time to time , like to exploit a simple variation of the calculation of the coherent closure of an auxiliary graph , which is related to the putative dsrg @xmath1 , as well as some helpful functions for the calculations with association schemes borrowed from the site @xcite .",
    "recall that first open parameter set for a dsrg appears for order @xmath135 . with growing of @xmath40 the fraction of open parameter sets is becoming more essential .",
    "this dictated our strategy in the selection of candidates for association schemes being considered . in",
    "what follows , we report only about successful attempts , resulted in discovery of graphs with open parameter sets .",
    "however , as a byproduct , many graphs with known parameter sets were also considered ( their comparison with known ones remains as one of tasks for a more systematic approach in the future ) .    roughly speaking , we distinguish a few different typical origins in our search :    * use of existing catalogues of association schemes ; * inspection of groups of automorphisms of some `` famous '' vertex - transitive graphs ; * consideration of incidence structures ; * investigation of cayley graphs .    in the next section",
    ", we are paying reasonable attention to a more detailed discussion of each of these approaches .",
    "here we consider several strategies for finding non - commutative association schemes which serve as input for searching new dsrgs .      for executing our strategy",
    "it is enough to consider non - commutative association schemes of small order at the first stage .",
    "they are systematically arranged according to their order and rank in the catalogue of hanaki and miyamoto @xcite .",
    "the number of new parameter sets , for which we succeed , using exactly this approach , is @xmath136 , see table [ tabs ] in summary . for several parameter sets , we have found a few non - equivalent dsrgs .",
    "table [ tab1 ] contains just the digraphs which are mutually non - equivalent . in this table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we display sufficient portion of information for reconstructing discovered dsrgs using the catalogue of association schemes by hanaki and miyamoto .",
    "we noticed that in @xcite `` class '' of association schemes is used instead of their `` rank '' .",
    "clearly , the number of classes is less by one than the rank .    from table [ tab1 ]",
    "it is easy to observe that graph nr .",
