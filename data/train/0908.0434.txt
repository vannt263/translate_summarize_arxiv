    "despite the great success of einstein s general theory of relativity , it is generally believed that it has to be modified at small distances , incorporating quantum effects of spacetime . to achieve this goal and arrive at a consistent theory of quantum gravity ,",
    "a number of different approaches have been proposed , including string theory and loop quantum gravity as best known examples . for another prominent approach ,",
    "see the contributions on causal dynamical triangulations to this proceedings .",
    "the aim of these models is to provide a microscopic description of quantum spacetime subsequently to make contact to more macroscopic phenomena , like e.g.  our universe . in doing",
    "so it turns out that it is quite hard to connect the very small length scales on which these models are defined with the large scales on which observable physics takes place , e.g.  cosmic inflation or particle physics .",
    "a complementary approach towards quantum gravity is to construct effective theories as an intermediate step between general relativity and a full theory of quantum gravity and study physical applications within it .",
    "these results can then possibly be used to connect full quantum gravities to physical phenomena .",
    "there have been many approaches in this direction , from which we choose the approach of noncommutative ( nc ) gravity based on a deformation of symmetries  @xcite ( see also the review  @xcite ) . for a generalization to nc supergravity ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind this formalism is to replace the classical symmetries of general relativity ( i.e.  the diffeomorphisms ) by a twist deformed hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms , which can be interpreted as quantum symmetries . as a result of this postulate one obtains that these theories naturally give rise to noncommutative spacetimes .",
    "thus we do not deal with a quantized metric field , but rather with a metric field on a quantum spacetime .",
    "we will give an introductory overview of the noncommutative gravity theory developed in @xcite .",
    "for a deeper discussion we refer to the original works and the review @xcite . after this",
    ", we will shortly review noncommutative symmetry reduction , discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "we will keep the discussion very brief and refer to the original paper for more details . as a next step",
    ", we will show under which conditions deformed symmetric models solve noncommutative einstein equations and discuss some phenomenology of deformed cosmological and black hole models .",
    "more details on exact solutions in nc gravity can be found in @xcite , or in the related works of schupp and solodukhin @xcite and aschieri and castellani @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of noncommutative geometry is to replace the usual coordinate functions @xmath1 on a manifold by noncommuting operators @xmath2 , satisfying nontrivial commutation relations    [ x^,x^ ] = i^(x )  .",
    "analogously to quantum mechanics , the nontrivial commutators imply uncertainty relations    x^x^0  ,    leading to an upper bound on the resolution in spacetime .    for our purposes , a more suitable approach to noncommutative geometry",
    "is to use @xmath0-products instead of operators .",
    "the basic idea is to modify , i.e.  to deform , the point - wise product in the algebra of functions on the manifold , leading to an associative , but noncommutative product .",
    "the @xmath0-products we will use in this work , the so - called rjs products @xcite , are given by    [ eqn : rjsprod ] ( f g)(x ) : = f(x )  ( ^ )  g(x )  ,    where @xmath3 are mutually commuting vector fields on the manifold satisfying @xmath4}=0 $ ] and @xmath5 is a constant and antisymmetric matrix , which can be chosen in the canonical ( i.e.  darboux ) form .",
    "the most widely studied @xmath0-product , the moyal - weyl product on @xmath6 , is part of this class .",
    "this can be seen by choosing the partial derivatives as twist generating vector fields , i.e.  @xmath7 .",
    "note that due to the noncommutativity of the @xmath0-product , we can have nontrivial commutators as well    [ fg ] : = fg - gf0  .    as a next step ,",
    "we want to discuss the symmetries of theories including @xmath0-products . for this",
    ", we have to note that the rjs @xmath0-product ( [ eqn : rjsprod ] ) can be obtained by using a so - called ( abelian or rjs type ) drinfeld twist given by    [ eqn : twist ] = ( - ^ x_x _ )  .    the @xmath0-product ( [ eqn : rjsprod ] ) is then given by    [ eqn : rjsprodtw ] fg = ( ^-1 fg )  ,    where @xmath8 is the usual pointwise multiplication map and @xmath9 is the inverse twist .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 denotes the action of vector fields on functions and is defined via the lie derivative @xmath11 .",
    "having identified the twist , we can construct the twisted symmetries of rjs deformed spaces . in order to do this , we start with the classical infinitesimal diffeomorphisms given by the lie algebra of vector fields on the manifold @xmath12})$ ] . from",
    "that we can construct in a canonical way a hopf algebra @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the universal envelopping algebra of vector fields , @xmath15 is the related multiplication and @xmath16 is the coproduct ( leibniz rule ) .",
    "we will not use the antipode @xmath17 and the counit @xmath18 in the following and refer to @xcite for a definition .",
    "the coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and acts on the generators as follows    ( u):= u1 + 1u  , ( 1):= 11  .    in order to deform the diffeomorphisms , such that they are compatible with the rjs product , we just have to deform the coproduct as follows    _ ( ) : = ( ) ^-1  ,    where @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath20 is still a hopf algebra , but now in general a noncocommutative one .",
    "we obtain the compatibility condition of the coproduct @xmath21    ( fg ) = _ ( fg ) = _ ( _ ( ) fg )  ,    where @xmath22 is the @xmath0-multiplication map .",
    "the @xmath0-product ( [ eqn : rjsprodtw ] ) can be generalized to @xmath0-tensor products , @xmath0-wedge products , etc . ,  by using the corresponding action of vector fields on the involved objects , i.e.  using the appropriate lie derivatives @xcite .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , one can construct covariant derivatives and riemannian curvature on twist deformed spaces .",
    "these objects are deformed covariant under the hopf algebra symmetries by using suitable combinations of the classical objects and the twist .    in this article",
    ", we will not review the nc riemannian geometry in a basis free form as presented in @xcite , but we will give all formulae in a particular simple basis of vector fields and one - forms .",
    "this will lead to a better readability of this review article .",
    "it can be shown that for all rjs twists ( [ eqn : twist ] ) , which are analytical almost everywhere , we can find a densely defined basis of vector fields @xmath23 , such that    [ eqn : basis ] [ e_a , x_]=0,[e_a , e_b]=0  ,    for all @xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 denotes the dimension of the manifold .",
    "this means in particular that the twist acts trivially on the basis vector fields .",
    "the associated dual basis @xmath26 defined by the pairing @xmath27 has the same property .    making use of the natural basis ( [ eqn : basis ] )",
    ", we obtain the following formulae for the geometrical quantities : given a metric @xmath28 , the inverse metric @xmath29 fulfills the condition    g_abg^ca= g^acg_ba= ^c_b  ,    thus it is simply the @xmath0-inverse matrix of @xmath30 .",

    ". other possibilities of defining the dynamics of the nc metric field , like e.g.  constructing a deformed version of the einstein - hilbert action , will be discussed elsewhere .    in the following",
    ", we will construct solutions of the nc einstein equations ( [ eqn : einstein ] ) .",
    "this is in general a very hard task , since these equations are nonlinear and also nonlocal due to the @xmath0-products . as in the classical case",
    ", symmetry reduction will turn out to be a helpful tool for constructing symmetric solutions .",
    "in classical gravity , it turned out that splitting the problem of describing physical situations into finding background solutions and afterwards perturbing them by field fluctuations on those fixed backgrounds is very fruitful for practical applications .",
    "in particular , if the problem obeys some approximate symmetries , like for example isotropy and homogeneity in cosmology , this approach has found many successful applications . using the example of cosmology , the typical steps are the restriction of the metric and inflaton field to spherical symmetric and translation invariant configurations , leading to the friedmann equations , which are in general easier to solve than the full einstein equations . after solving for the background fields",
    ", one allows small fluctuations of the metric and scalar field in order to determine , e.g. ,  the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .    in this article",

    "as it was recognized and explained in @xcite , as well as in the related works @xcite , the deformed symmetric equations of motion reduce to the undeformed ones , if the twist ( [ eqn : twist ] ) satisfies    [ eqn : semikilling ] ^ x_x _   +  .",
    "twists of this form are called semi - killing , since using the canonical form of @xmath5 , half of the vector fields @xmath43 have to be killing vector fields , i.e.  @xmath49 .",
    "the fact that all @xmath0-products between @xmath0-symmetric tensor fields drop out can be easily understood , since acting with ( [ eqn : semikilling ] ) on @xmath0-symmetric tensor fields is trivial due to their remaining classical symmetries @xmath50 , see table [ tab : comparison ] .",
