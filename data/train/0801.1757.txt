    "the term `` master equation '' ( me ) used in this work means an equation of motion for the reduced density operator @xmath0 of subsystem @xmath1 which interacts with ( usually much larger ) another subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "experiences gathered during quite a few years of lecturing indicate that students find it difficult to understand the derivation and consequences of me .",
    "the literature sources ( at least those known to us ) are usually quite brief and not easy to follow .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a full presentation of the so - called microscopic derivation of me together with detailed discussion of the underlying assumptions and approximations .",
    "hence , this work does not bring any original material .",
    "it is just a tutorial which , hopefully , will help the students to obtain a better grasp of the ideas and concepts leading to one of important theoretical methods used in a variety of physical problems .",
    "the literature of the subject is quite rich . entering the term `` master equation '' into _ google scholar _ returns about 30 000 links .",
    "it seems virtually impossible to give an extensive bibliography .",
    "therefore , we concentrate only on several works which were essential in the preparation of this paper .      in order to present the me technique",
    ", we first give the basic ideas which help , so to speak , to set the scene for further developments .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics ( given , for example , in the main chapters of the first volume of the excellent book by cohen - tannoudji _ et al _ @xcite ) .    to start with , we recall that the state of the quantum system is , in the majority of practical applications , given by the density operator .",
    "this concept is introduced and discussed in virtually all handbooks on quantum mechanics , hence we mention only the basic facts which will be needed here .",
    "namely , density operator for any physical system must have three essential properties    [ ii01 ] @xmath3    the last inequality means that @xmath4 for any state @xmath5 from the hilbert space of the states of the given physical system . these properties may be phrased in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath6 of the density operator .",
    "namely , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .    for a closed system with hamiltonian @xmath10 , the evolution of the corresponding density operator",
    "is given by the von neumann equation @xmath11 , \\label{ii03}\\ ] ] which has a well - known solution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a suitably chosen initial condition .",
    "such an evolution is unitary @xcite and obviously preserves all the necessary properties of the density operator .",
    "in such a case everything is conceptually clear although necessary calculation may be quite involved or even requiring some approximate computational methods .",
    "the problem arises when we deal with a bipartite system @xmath14 , consisting of two interacting subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us briefly outline the physical situation .",
    "we assume that the whole system @xmath14 is closed and the total hamiltonian is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are free , independent hamiltonians of each of the subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20  is the hamiltonian describing the interaction between two parts .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the density operator of the total system .",
    "then , @xmath21 evolves according to the von neumann equation ( identical as ) @xmath22 , \\label{ii06}\\ ] ] now , one may ask , what is the problem ? the point is that we are , in fact , interested only in the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "subsystem @xmath2 , for this reason or other , is considered irrelevant , although the @xmath1-@xmath2 interaction certainly affects the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in many practical cases , subsystem @xmath2 is much larger ( with many more degrees of freedom ) and virtually inaccessible to direct measurements .",
    "frequently , @xmath2 is a reservoir @xcite and plays the role of environment upon which we have neither control nor influence",
    ". this may be very important in the context of quantum information theory @xcite when the relevant subsystem is disturbed by the surroundings .",
    "moreover , problems of decoherence and irreversibility are intrinsically connected with the effects occurring in a subsystem influenced by an external reservoir ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall not discuss these problems but focus on master equation technique .",
    "in the view of these brief remarks the question is , how to extract useful information on @xmath1 from the general von neumann equation . we stress that we are interested only in system @xmath1 , so we need to find the reduced density operator @xmath23 the aim is , therefore , twofold :    * extract the evolution of @xmath0 from eq .",
    "for the entire system @xmath24 .",
    "* do it in a way which guarantees that properties of @xmath0 ( as of any density operator ) are preserved for any moment of time .",
    "the solution to the stated problems is found in the so - called master equation technique .",
    "there are two , conceptually different but complementary , approaches to me .",
    "the first one uses mathematically rigorous methods .",
    "such an approach is presented , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also the references given in these books ) .",
    "rigorous mathematics is obviously very important from the fundamental point of view .",

    ", we do not go into the details of the derivation of the standard form of the master equation , we refer the reader to the mentioned references ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "quite interesting derivation of standard me is given by preskill @xcite .",
    "his presentation is somewhat heuristic but certainly worth reading , especially if one is interested in connection with quantum information theory , quantum channels etc .",
    "it is not , however , our aim to pursue formal mathematical issues .",
    "our intentions are quite practical , so the reader may ask , why do we speak about the standard form of me .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the second approach to the stated problems is via `` microscopic derivations '' .",
    "this occurs when we need to consider a specific physical situation when interacting systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are known and well - defined .",
    "then , we want to construct the corresponding me  equation of motion for the reduced density operator @xmath0 .",
    "this is less formal and may be mathematically uncertain .",
    "if the microscopic derivation yields an equation in the standard form , we can say that the aim is achieved , because standard form ensures the preservation of the necessary properties of reduced density operator @xmath0 . hence , both approaches are complementary . formal but rigorous mathematical methods lead to standard form of me which must be matched by equations obtained through microscopic derivation .",
    "all of the already mentioned references give ( usually brief ) account on the microscopic derivation of me .",
    "these presentations seem to be difficult for students who are not acquainted with the subject and who seek the necessary introduction . perhaps the most extensive microscopic derivation is given by cohen - tannoudji , dupont - roc and grynberg @xcite .",
    "this latter presentation is somewhat heuristic and , as it seems to us , leaves some nuances unexplained .",
    "there is , however , one more drawback .",
    "namely , cohen - tannoudji _ et al _ do not compare their me with the standard form .",
    "therefore , essential question of positivity preservation remains untouched .",
    "the derivation given here uses the concepts which can be found in the all references . nevertheless , we are most indebted to cohen - tannoudji _ et al_. their approach and especially their discussion of the time scales and employed approximations strongly influenced our tutorial .",

    "is estimated by @xmath328 because the area of the integration region is estimated by the product @xmath329 ( area of the belt under the diagonal @xmath140 ) .",
    "introduced parameter @xmath50 characterizes the `` strength '' of the interaction between the reservoir and system @xmath18 .",
    "the factor which multiplies @xmath167 in has ( according to ) the sense of the inverse of time @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we obtain an estimate @xmath330      what is the condition of the existence of two time scales ?",
    "the estimate of @xmath45 given in allows us to find such a condition .",
    "let us look upon condition @xmath52 more carefully and introduce the estimate .",
    "this yields @xmath331 the last inequality is the sought condition of existence of two time scales .",
    "if we denote @xmath332 , then we can write @xmath333 .",
    "so the interaction must be characterized by such bohr frequency @xmath334 that during the time interval of magnitude of @xmath44 its influence on system @xmath18 is negligibly small .",
    "we already mentioned ( see the discussion of eq . ) , that it is possible to iterate von neumann equation ",
    "accounting for higher order corrections would increase accuracy .",
    "we can estimate these higher order terms in the same manner as done just above .",
    "for example , for the third order term we have @xmath335 because times @xmath136 , @xmath143 and @xmath336 must be close to each other ( with accuracy of the order of @xmath44 ) .",
    "then the region of integration has volume of the order of @xmath337 .",
    "due to eq .",
    "we get @xmath338 where the last inequality follows from .",
    "the obtained estimate shows that the third order iteration ( and similarly higher ones ) are indeed negligible .",
    "obviously this holds provided the condition is true and ensures the existence of two distinct time scales .      moving from eq .",
    "to we have neglected initial correlations between systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these correlations built up at earlier moments @xmath340 .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that at some earlier moment @xmath341 ( @xmath342 ) both systems were uncorrelated .",
    "this happens , for example , when the interaction was switched on at an instant @xmath341 .",
    "so the correlations described by @xmath343 need time @xmath344 to appear .",
    "if the correlations exist ( @xmath345 ) then averaging of the term linear in interaction ( as in expression ) would not give zero .",
    "hence , @xmath345 would result in the appearance of the linear term .",
    "moreover , this would also automatically modify the quadratic term in .",
    "let us estimate the magnitude of this modification ( which is due to earlier interaction ) @xmath346 the integrand contains correlation functions of the reservoir .",
    "hence the integrand would be practically zero for @xmath347 .",
    "the integration runs effectively from @xmath348 to @xmath349 .",
    "therefore , using condition , we estimate @xmath350 as the integrals are nonzero within the interval of the length of the order of @xmath44 . if @xmath61 then the correction is small ( main contribution to the evolution of @xmath167 is of the order of @xmath351 , which is quite larger ) .",
    "the key assumption that @xmath61 allows us to conclude that the correlations between system @xmath18 and @xmath19 which were built before moment @xmath35 do not significantly change the evolution of @xmath42 , their influence is restricted to the moments from a very short interval @xmath352 .",
    "new correlations , within a much longer interval @xmath163 , are building up and have an effect on the evolution of @xmath42 .",
    "initial correlations have small significance and hence it is justified to neglect them .",
    "secular approximation consists in replacing the function @xmath181 ( defined in ) in by kronecker delta , which leads to eq .. our discussion of this replacement does not rise any doubts when @xmath353 , because then @xmath194 is practically unity . on the other hand for @xmath354",
    "the function @xmath194 is practically zero .",
    "the only problem is to justify the neglecting of the terms for which @xmath355 .",
    "to explain this point , first use the fact that the free evolution of matrix elements @xmath356 is governed by @xmath357 { | \\ , b \\ , \\rangle }     ~=~ -i \\omega_{ab } \\rho_{ab}^{(f ) } , \\label{medd01}\\ ] ] where the small lamb shift ( due to @xmath219 ) is ignored .",
    "the solution is simple @xmath358    now , we analyze the dissipative term which is given by .",
    "we do not discuss the nuances connected with possible degeneracies .",
    "obviously , we can write @xmath359 which we use in . we also interchange indices @xmath360 in the second term and similarly , in the third one we first interchange @xmath361 and then @xmath362 .",
    "the result is @xmath363 we note that @xmath364 implies @xmath365 , and then @xmath366 .",
    "therefore @xmath367 since @xmath366 and changes nothing .",
    "similarly we have @xmath368 finally , we note that @xmath369 , because kronecker delta is even . after these manipulations eq . can be written as @xmath370 the expression in braces is denoted as @xmath371 and we have @xmath372 this is a specific form of me , but useful in the discussion . however , in the degenerate case some care must be exercised and renewed considerations might be necessary .",
    "we proceed to the discussion of conditions and/or possibilities of neglecting the terms for which @xmath355 .",
    "interaction with the reservoir certainly modifies the free evolution of @xmath373 .",
    "if bohr frequencies of the oscillating elements @xmath356 i @xmath374 are such that @xmath375 , then mutual couplings between these elements are quickly averaged to zero ( interfere destructively ) before time @xmath45 elapses and before the interaction has enough time to affect the evolution . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath376 differs much from @xmath351 then the coupling between corresponding matrix elements will have small ( weak ) effect .",
    "this is the situation similar to the one encountered in perturbation theory .",
    "namely , when the energies @xmath377 then the perturbation has small ( usually negligible ) effect .",
    "since , by assumption @xmath378 the discussed situation corresponds , in fact , to the relation @xmath379 . this , in turn means , that such terms have little influence on the evolution of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "such terms are neglected while passing from eq .",
    "thus the last of our approximations is justified .      in our considerations",
    "we have adopted the interaction hamiltonian between the system @xmath18 and reservoir @xmath19 in the form @xmath381 , where operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 do not have to be hermitian . certainly , the full interaction hamiltonian must be hermitian , so we conclude that it must contain operators @xmath75 , @xmath76 and their hermitian conjugates @xmath382 , @xmath383 . constructing linear combinations we can always transform the interaction hamiltonian into @xmath384 , where the primed operators are hermitian .    we shall illustrate this with a simple example .",
    "let the interaction hamiltonian be of the form @xmath385 where operators @xmath225 and @xmath386 are nonhermitian , while the full hamiltonian is clearly hermitian .",
    "we define new operators @xmath387 which are evidently hermitian . expressing operators @xmath225 , @xmath386 and their conjugates via the new ones , we obtain @xmath388 this interaction hamiltonian is expressed as a sum of products of hermitian operators .",
    "hence construction of the interaction hamiltonian with nonhermitian operators is allowed .",
    "one can always build necessary combinations .",
    "however , in some practical applications it is much more convenient to use nonhermitian operators than the linear combinations .      in the main part of the lecture we assumed that eq . holds , that is the average @xmath390 .",
    "we have stated that it is not really restrictive .",
    "we will show that it is true .",
    "this is so , because we can always shift the energy scale . to see this ,",
    "let us write @xmath391 where @xmath392 is a number not necessarily equal to zero .",
    "then we have @xmath393 which holds no matter whether numbers @xmath389 are zeroes or not .",
    "full hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath394 \\otimes { \\mathbf{1}}_{b }         ~+~{\\mathbf{1}}_{a}\\otimes h_{b }         ~+~v^{\\,'}_{ab}. \\label{mef3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rescaled interaction term ( the last one ) has zero average ( as in ) .",
    "this is achieved by the redefinition of the energy scale in system @xmath18  via redefinition of the hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
