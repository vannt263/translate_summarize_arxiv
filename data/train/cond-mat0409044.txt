    "in the passing decade , some specific phases , having quasi - one - dimensional structure , the so called striped phases , have been a highly debated subject in condensed - matter physics . apparently , a broad interest in such phases was initiated by reports presenting experimental evidence for the existence of charge strips in doped layered perovskites , some of which constitute materials exhibiting high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .    however , striped phases had been observed much earlier , for instance on metallic surfaces covered with an adsorbate , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "theoretical descriptions of these phenomena involved various kinds of lattice gas models @xcite .",
    "many other instances of experimental observations of stripe - ordered phases are listed in @xcite , where monte - carlo studies of formation of striped phases in a continuous gas with hardcore and short - range repulsive interactions are reported .    quite interestingly , theoretical studies of striped phases in systems of strongly correlated electrons have preceded experimental observations of such phases @xcite .",
    "but only after those observations , the discussion became much more vigorous , and the nature of stripe - ordered phases started to attract attention of numerous researchers . in the context of the hubbard model , a comprehensive review of the problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "the existence of the same kind of striped phases was investigated also in the @xmath0@xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "a bird s eye view on the problem of stripe - ordered phases in high - temperature superconductors , but emphasizing its general relevance for contemporary condensed - matter physics can be found in @xcite .",
    "the general relevance of striped phases is underlined also in @xcite , where they are viewed as an emergent phenomenon resulting from collective motions of microscopic particles , somewhat analogous to quasi - particles like phonons .",
    "striped phases have been also studied in the framework of quantum - spin models , like @xmath2 model for instance @xcite .",
    "the hubbard or @xmath0@xmath1-like models belong to the most realistic models , in the framework of which the problem of striped - ordered phases in doped layered perovskites can be investigated . in the both models , the spin and the charge degrees of freedom are taken into account , and it is believed that it is the competition between these degrees of freedom that is decisive for the formation of striped phases .",
    "the question of formation of striped phases is closely related to the question of relative stability of these phases against mixtures of an electron - reach phase and a hole - reach phase . due to the tiny energy differences between both phases ,",
    "the results obtained by means of approximate methods , which introduce hardly - controllable errors , are disparate . and",
    "this can be said despite , as emphasized in @xcite , a spectacular consensus of results concerning half - filled stripes , obtained by means of various approximate methods .",
    "therefore , as pointed out in @xcite further careful studies are necessary to settle the problem of formation of stripe - ordered phases .",
    "one of possible ways of attacking this problem is to formulate analog problems in less realistic but simpler models , where some control over the results obtained by means of various methods of many - body physics can be gained .",
    "this leads hopefully to a deeper insight into the , mentioned above , stability problem .",
    "such an approach has been adopted by many researchers , see for instance @xcite .",
    "buhler et al @xcite have found , by means of monte carlo simulations , that upon hole doping antiferromagnetic spin domains and charge stripes , whose properties are in very good agreement with experiments , appear in a spin - fermion model for cuprates . using the so called restricted phase diagrams , the stability problem of charge - stripe phases has been studied in the spinless falicov  kimball model by lemanski et al @xcite .",
    "in their study the formation of charge stripe - ordered phases can be looked upon as a way the system interpolates between a periodic charge - density wave phase ( the chessboard phase ) and the segregated phase ( a mixture of completely filled and completely empty phases ) , as the degree of doping varies .",
    "a considerable reduction of the hilbert space dimension in a spinless fermion model with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion ( as compared to a hubbard model ) has been exploited by zhang and henley @xcite to study carefully , by means of an exact diagonalization technique , the formation of charge stripe - ordered phases upon doping .",
    "they addressed also an interesting question of the role of quantum statistics in the problem of striped phases , by replacing fermion particles with hardcore boson ones .",
    "our work has been inspired mainly by the recent studies of lemaski et al @xcite and by zhang and henley @xcite .",
    "to investigate the key question , whether charge stripe - ordered phases are stable compared to a phase - separated state , we study rigorously the strong - coupling limit of an extended spinless falicov  kimball model on a square lattice , with mobile particles being spinless fermions or hardcore bosons . the usual spinless falicov  kimball hamiltonian ( such as that studied in @xcite ) has been augmented by a direct , ising - like , interaction between the immobile particles .",
    "to explain the role played by the extra interaction we have to make a few remarks .",
    "firstly , for technical reasons , our analysis is restricted to the case of half - filling .",
    "secondly , it is now well established ( proven ) @xcite that , in the fermion spinless falicov ",
    "kimball model the phase - separated state , the segregated phase , is stable only off the half - filling .",
    "thus , an additional interaction is needed to stabilize the segregated phase at half - filling .",
    "thirdly , in the regime of singly occupied sites and for strong - coupling , the strongest effective interaction in the hubbard model is the heisenberg antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "doping of holes can be seen as means to weaken the strong tendency toward antiferromagnetic ordering and to make possible a phase separated state with hole - reach and electron - reach regions . under similar conditions , in the spinless falicov ",
    "kimball model an analogous role is played by the ising - like nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "repulsive interaction between the immobile particles that favors a chessboard - like ordering .",
    "the effect of weakening of the strong tendency toward chessboard ordering can be achieved by an extra ising - like n.n .",
    "interaction that compensates the strongest repulsive interaction , and consequently permits the system to reach a phase - separated state , the segregated phase . on varying , in a suitable interval of values ,",
    "the corresponding interaction constant , which is our control parameter , we can study how the both systems `` evolve '' from the crystalline chessboard phase to the segregated one .",
    "we prove that by varying the interaction constant of the direct n.n .",
    "interaction between the immobile particles , the both systems ( fermion and boson ) can be driven , via a sequence of phase transitions , from a crystalline state ( the chessboard phase ) to a phase - separated state ( the segregated phase ) . moreover , these transitions occur necessarily via charge - stripe phases : via a diagonal striped phase in the case of fermions and via vertical ( horizontal ) striped phases in the case of hardcore bosons .",
    "thus , short - range interactions in quantum gases are sufficient for the appearance of charge stripe - ordered phases .    in our studies",
    ", we include also a subsidiary direct interaction between the immobile particles , an ising - like next nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) interaction , much weaker than the n.n . interaction .",
    "this interaction can reinforce or frustrate the n.n .",
    "interaction , depending on the sign of its interaction constant .",
    "it appears that on varying the control parameter ( the strength of n.n .",
    "interactions ) , the systems ( fermion or boson ) characterized by different values of n.n.n .",
    "interactions , may undergo different sequences of transitions between the chessboard phase and the segregated one .",
    "we find , in particular , that if we set appropriate values of the n.n.n .",
    "interaction in the fermion system and in the boson one , then the both systems settle in the same phases , for typical values of the control parameter . on the other hand , the n.n.n .",
    "interaction enables us to demonstrate that the ground - state phase diagrams in the cases of mobile fermions and mobile hardcore bosons are definitely different .    as a byproduct of our considerations",
    ", we obtain an ising - like short - range hamiltonian , with pair interactions at distance of two lattice constants and four - site ( plaquette ) interactions , whose ground states consist of stripe - like configurations or chessboard - like configurations , depending on the sign of the unique coupling constant .",
    "these ground states are stable with respect to perturbations by n.n . and",
    "n.n.n . interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the considered models and general properties of the corresponding hamiltonians .",
    "then , in section 3 we construct phase diagrams due to truncated effective interactions . after that , in section 4 , we analyze the phase diagrams due to complete interactions ( without truncation ) of the both quantum systems studied here and formulate our conclusions .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "the model to be studied is a simplified version of the one band , spin @xmath3 hubbard model , known as the static approximation ( one sort of electrons hops while the other sort is immobile ) , augmented by a direct ising - like interaction @xmath4 between the immobile particles .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system reads :    @xmath5    in the above formulae , the underlying lattice is a square lattice , denoted @xmath6 , consisting of sites @xmath7 , whose number is @xmath8 , having the shape of a @xmath9 torus . in ( [ hfk],[v ] ) and below , the sums @xmath10 , @xmath11 , stand for the summation over all the @xmath12-th order n.n .",
    "pairs of lattice sites in @xmath6 , with each pair counted once .",
    "the subsystem of mobile spinless particles is described in terms of creation and annihilation operators of an electron at site @xmath13 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , respectively , satisfying the canonical anticommutation relations ( spinless electrons ) or the commutation relations of spin @xmath3 operators @xmath16 ( hardcore bosons ) . the total electron - number ( boson - number ) operator is @xmath17 , and",
    "( with a little abuse of notation ) the corresponding electron ( boson ) density is @xmath18 .",
    "there is no direct interaction between mobile particles .",
    "their energy is due to hopping , with @xmath0 being the n.n . hopping intensity , and due to the interaction with the localized particles ,",
    "whose strength is controlled by the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "the subsystem of localized particles ( here - after called ions ) , is described by a collection of pseudo - spins @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 if the site @xmath13 is occupied by an ion and @xmath23 if it is empty ) , called the _",
    "ion configurations_. the total number of ions is @xmath24 and the ion density is @xmath25 . in our model",
    "the ions interact directly , with energy given by @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , in the composite system , whose hamiltonian is given by ( [ h0 ] ) , with arbitrary electron - ion ( boson - ion ) coupling @xmath19 , the particle - number operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and pseudo - spins @xmath28 , are conserved .",
    "therefore the description of the classical subsystem in terms of the ion configurations @xmath29 remains valid .",
    "whenever periodic configurations of pseudo - spins are considered , it is assumed that @xmath6 is sufficiently large , so that it accommodates an integer number of elementary cells .",
    "nowadays , @xmath30 is widely known as the hamiltonian of the spinless falicov  kimball model , a simplified version of the hamiltonian put forward in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the spinless - fermion falicov ",
    "kimball model is the unique system of interacting fermions , for which the existence of a long - range order ( the chessboard phase ) @xcite and of a phase separation ( the segregated phase ) @xcite have been proved .",
    "a review of other rigorous results and an extensive list of relevant references can be found in @xcite ) .    in what follows",
    ", we shall study the ground - state phase diagram of the system defined by ( [ h0 ] ) in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "that is , let @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the chemical potentials of the electrons ( bosons ) and ions , respectively , and let @xmath34 be the ground - state energy of @xmath35 , for a given configuration @xmath36 of the ions . then , the ground - state energy of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "the minimum is attained at the set @xmath40 of the ground - state configurations of ions .",
    "we shall determine the subsets of the @xmath41-plane , where @xmath40 consists of periodic configurations of ions , uniformly in the size of the underlying square lattice .    in studies of grand - canonical phase diagrams",
    "an important role is played by unitary transformations ( _ hole  particle transformations _ ) that exchange particles and holes , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and for some @xmath44 leave the hamiltonian @xmath37 invariant . for the mobile particles such a role is played by the transformations : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for bosons while for fermions @xmath46 at the even sublattice of @xmath6 and @xmath47 at the odd one . clearly , since @xmath48 is invariant under the joint hole ",
    "particle transformation of mobile and localized particles , @xmath49 is hole ",
    "particle invariant at the point @xmath50 . at the hole ",
    "particle symmetry point , the system under consideration has very special properties , which simplify studies of its phase diagram @xcite .",
    "moreover , by means of the defined above hole - particle transformations one can determine a number of symmetries of the grand - canonical phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the model is that the case of attraction ( @xmath51 ) and the case of repulsion ( @xmath52 ) are related by a unitary transformation ( the hole - particle transformation for ions ) : if @xmath53 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath54 for @xmath52 , then @xmath55 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath56 for @xmath51 . consequently , without any loss of generality one can fix the sign of the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "moreover ( with the sign of @xmath19 fixed ) , there is an _ inversion symmetry _ of the grand - canonical phase diagram , that is , if @xmath36 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath54 , then @xmath57 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to determine the phase diagram in a half - plane specified by fixing the sign of one of the chemical potentials .",
    "our aim in this paper is to investigate the ground - state phase diagrams of our systems , for general values of the energy parameters that appear in @xmath49 . according to the state of art , this is feasible only in the strong - coupling regime , i.e. when @xmath59 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , from now on we shall consider exclusively the case of a large positive coupling @xmath19 , and we express all the parameters of @xmath49 in the units of @xmath19 , preserving the previous notation .    in the strong - coupling regime ,",
    "the ground - state energy @xmath60 can be expanded in a power series in @xmath0 .",
    "one of the ways to achieve this , for fermions and for hardcore bosons , is a closed - loop expansion @xcite .",
    "the result , with the expansion terms up to order four shown explicitly , reads :    @xmath61 \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1 } }   s_{x}s_{y } + \\left [ \\frac{3t^{4}}{16 }",

    "it can be proved that the above expansions are absolutely convergent , uniformly in @xmath6 , provided that @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "under these conditions the particle densities satisfy the half - filling relation : @xmath74 .",
    "we note that on taking into account the inversion symmetry of the phase diagram in the @xmath54-plane and the fact that the ground - state energies depend only on the difference of the chemical potentials , in order to determine the phase diagram in the stripe @xmath75 it is enough to consider the phase diagram at the half - line @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) . at this half - line",
    "we set @xmath79 .    due to the convergence of the expansions ( [ expfmn ] ) and ( [ exphcb ] ) , it is possible to establish rigorously a part of the phase diagram ( that is the ground - state configurations of ions are determined everywhere in the @xmath41-plane",

    "an inspection of ( [ expfmn ] ) and ( [ exphcb ] ) reveals that up to the second order the effective hamiltonians for fermions and hardcore bosons are the same .",
    "hence , the discussion that follows applies to the both cases , and the common effective hamiltonians are denoted as @xmath84 , @xmath85 .    in the zeroth order , @xmath86 where",

    "the set of the minimizing @xmath122-plaquette configurations contains always the subset @xmath168 , but it may contain also some additional @xmath122-plaquette configurations of minimal energy . consequently , the set of the ground - state configurations at the boundary contains always the subset @xmath169 and typically a great many of other ground - state configurations , whose number grows indefinitely with the size of the lattice . in the considered diagrams ,",
    "the only exception is the boundary between @xmath152 and @xmath162 , where the set of the ground - state configurations amounts exactly to @xmath170 .",
    "we start with a few comments concerning the phase diagrams due to the fourth order effective interactions . in the fourth order",
    "effective interaction , the parameters @xmath171 and @xmath172 control the strength of n.n . and",
    "interactions , respectively . the n.n .",
    "interaction is repulsive and favors the chessboard configurations if @xmath173 , for fermions ( @xmath174 , for bosons ) . in the opposite case ( attraction )",
    "it favors the @xmath91 , @xmath90 configurations . in turn , the n.n.n .",
    "interaction is attractive if @xmath175 , for fermions ( @xmath176 , for bosons ) , and then it reinforces the tendency towards chessboard and uniform , @xmath91 , @xmath90 , configurations .",
    "when it becomes repulsive , it frustrates the n.n .",
    "interaction : the more negative it is the larger @xmath171 is needed to stabilize the chessboard configurations and the smaller @xmath171 is needed to stabilize the @xmath91 , @xmath90 configurations . therefore , whatever the value of @xmath172 is , there is a sufficiently large @xmath171 such that @xmath177 and a sufficiently small @xmath171 such that @xmath178 .    apparently , the fourth order phase diagrams in the cases of hoping fermions and hoping bosons are quite similar if we compare the geometry of the phase boundaries and the sets of ground states .",
    "the main difference is in the domain occupying the central position : in the case of fermions the ground - state configurations are diagonal - stripe configurations , @xmath179 , while in the case of bosons this is the set @xmath161 of plaquette - chessboard configurations .",
    "these two sets of configurations are ground - state configurations of the corresponding fourth - order effective interactions with the site , n.n . , and n.n.n .",
    "terms dropped , which corresponds to the points @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "this means that the fourth order phase diagrams can be looked upon as the result of perturbing an ising - like hamiltonian , that consists of pair interactions at distance of two lattice constants and plaquette interactions , by n.n . and n.n.n",
    ". interactions . more generally , it is easy to verify that the set of ground - state configurations of the ising - like hamiltonian , @xmath182 amount to @xmath179 if @xmath183 , and to @xmath161 if @xmath184 .",
    "these ground states are stable with respect to perturbations by n.n . and n.n.n",
    ". interactions , if the corresponding interaction constants are in a certain vicinity of zero .",
    "otherwise , new sets of ground states , shown in fig .",
    "[ t40f ] and fig .",
    "[ t40b ] emerge .",
    "the basic question to be answered , before discussing the phase diagrams due to the complete interaction , refers to the relation between these phase diagrams and the diagrams due to the truncated effective interactions , obtained in the previous section .",
    "firstly , we note , by inspection of the phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ t40f ] and fig .",
    "[ t40b ] , that the @xmath122-plaquette configurations @xmath185 are missing in the phase diagram corresponding to fermion mobile particles . in turn , the @xmath122-plaquette configurations @xmath186 are missing in the phase diagram corresponding to boson mobile particles .",
    "consequently , the ground - state configurations of @xmath161 can not appear not only in the fourth order fermion phase diagram but also in the fermion phase diagram of the complete interaction .",
    "similarly , the ground - state configurations of @xmath179 do not appear in boson phase diagrams .",
    "secondly , by adapting the arguments presented in @xcite , we can demonstrate , see for instance @xcite , that if the remainder @xmath66 is taken into account , then there is a ( sufficiently small ) constant @xmath187 such that for @xmath188 the phase diagram looks the same as the phase diagram due to the effective interaction truncated at the fourth order , except some regions of width @xmath189 , located along the boundaries between the domains , and except the domain @xmath143 . for @xmath188 and each domain @xmath142 , @xmath190",
    ", there is a nonempty two - dimensional open domain @xmath191 that is contained in the domain @xmath142 and such that in @xmath191 the set of ground - state configurations coincides with @xmath142 .",
    "now , consider our systems for specified particle densities , @xmath192 . according to the phase diagrams in the hole - particle symmetry plane ( @xmath193 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ t40f ] and fig .",
    "[ t40b ] , if @xmath194 is in @xmath195 , then the ground state is a phase - separated state , where ion configurations are mixtures of @xmath91 and @xmath90 configurations , called the segregated phase .",
    "another phase - separated state , where the ion configurations are mixtures of @xmath91 , @xmath90 , @xmath93 , and @xmath95 configurations , exists at a line that is a small ( @xmath196 ) distortion of the boundary between the domains @xmath152 and @xmath162 @xcite . in all the other domains @xmath191 of these diagrams",
    "the ground - state phase exhibits a crystalline long - range order of ions .    by the properties of the fourth order phase diagrams , whatever the value of @xmath172 is",
    ", there is a sufficiently large @xmath171 such that the systems are in the chessboard phase ( @xmath197 ) and a sufficiently small @xmath171 such that the systems are in the segregated phase ( @xmath198 ) . in between",
    ", the systems undergo a series of phase transitions and visit various striped phases . consider first unbiased systems ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "then , it follows from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ t40f ] , that the fermion system visits necessarily the diagonal striped phase , described by the configurations in @xmath179 . in turn , the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ t40b ] implies that the boson system has to visit the dimerized - chessboard phase , described by the configurations in @xmath163 , then the vertical / horizontal striped phase , described by the configurations in @xmath199 , and after that a dimerized vertical / horizontal striped phase , described by the configurations in @xmath200 .",
    "these scenarios are preserved , if @xmath201 in the fermion case , and @xmath202 in the boson case .",
    "note that the same sequence of transitions , as found in the unbiased boson system , can be realized by the fermion system if @xmath172 is sufficiently small ( @xmath203 ) .    for somewhat larger values of @xmath172 , @xmath204 , on its way from the chessboard phase",
    "to the segregated phase the fermion systems visits the dimerized chessboard phase , then the diagonal striped phase , and after that the dimerized vertical / horizontal striped phase . the vertical / horizontal striped phase is closer to the segregated phase than the diagonal striped phase . in case the both kinds of stripe phases ( vertical / horizontal and diagonal ) appear in a phase diagram , such a succession of striped phases is perhaps generic , see also @xcite .    for sufficiently large @xmath172 ,",
    "the tendency toward the chessboard and the uniform configurations is so strong that the both systems jump directly from the chessboard phase to the segregated phase .",
    "above , we have described the states of the considered systems for typical values of the control parameter @xmath171 . only in small intervals (",
    "whose width is of the order of @xmath196 ) of values of @xmath171 , about the transition points of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ t40f ] and fig .",
    "[ t40b ] , the states of the systems remain undetermined .",
    "for completeness we present also ground - state phase diagrams of the both systems off the hole - particle symmetry plane , for @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "[ t41f ] ,  [ t41b ] .",
    "away from the hole - particle symmetry plane new phases appear .",
    "in particular we find the phases described by the quasi - one - dimensional configurations @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 , well known from the studies of the phase diagram of the spinless falicov  kimball model @xcite . in the boson phase diagram ,",
    "[ t41b ] , there appears the domain @xmath143 that is not amenable to the kind of arguments used in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we address the problem of the stability of charge - stripe phases versus the phase separated state  the segregated phase , in strongly - interacting systems of fermions or hardcore bosons .",
    "there are numerous works devoted to this problem , where it is studied , by approximate methods , in the framework of relevant for experiments models . unfortunately , due to tiny energy differences involved ,",
    "it is difficult to settle this problem by means of approximate methods , which bias the calculated energies with hardly controllable errors of various nature .",
    "we have studied simple models , that by many physicists can be considered less realistic , but which , in return , are amenable to a rigorous analysis .",
    "our models are described by extended falicov  kimball hamiltonians , with hoping particles being spinless fermions or hardcore bosons .",
    "the ground - state phase diagrams of these models have been constructed rigorously in the regime of strong coupling and half - filling . in the both cases , of fermions and hardcore bosons ,",
    "we have found transitions from a crystalline chessboard phase to the segregated phase via striped phases .",

    "this work was partially supported by scientific research grant * 2479/w / ift * ( university of wrocaw ) .",
    "in this section , at each point @xmath145 we give the sets @xmath208 of the zero - potential coefficients @xmath133 that we used to construct the four phase diagrams , presented in the previous section .",
    "specifically , for each of the four phase diagrams we define a partition , called @xmath209-partition , of the @xmath210-plane ( see the tables displayed below ) into sets that differ , in general , from the domains @xmath142 .",
    "to each set of such a partition we assign a set @xmath211 of triplets of rational numbers , such that the coefficients @xmath212 ( with @xmath144 in the considered set ) are affine functions of the form @xmath213 .",
    "we have not been able to find one set @xmath211 , that turns the fourth order potentials into @xmath83-potentials in the whole @xmath210-plane .",
