    "( 2015 , hereafter m15 ) disentangled the light curve of hd170582 into an orbital part , determining a period of 16.87 days and revealing orbital ellipsoidal variability with unequal maxima , and a long cycle of 587 days , showing quasi - sinusoidal changes with amplitude @xmath10= 0.1 mag .",
    "they modeled the orbital light curve with a cool evolved star of @xmath11 = 1.9 @xmath12 0.1 @xmath13 , @xmath14 = 8000 @xmath12 100 @xmath15 and @xmath16 = 15.6 @xmath12 0.2 @xmath17 , and an early b - type dwarf of @xmath18 = 9.0 @xmath12 0.2 @xmath13 surrounded by a geometrically and optically thick accretion disc of radial extension 20.8 @xmath12 0.3 @xmath17 , contributing about 35% to the system luminosity in the @xmath8-band .",

    "we divide the paper as follows : in section 2 we present the spectroscopic data used in this paper , in section 3 we give insights on emission line profile variability . in the same section we build doppler tomograms for the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission lines , discuss the system evolutionary stage , obtain a value for the mass transfer rate , and present a study of the luminosity of the dpv accretion discs .",
