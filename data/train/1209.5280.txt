    "after their experimental realization , single and bilayer graphene sheets and nanoribbons have attracted intensive attention due to their peculiar properties , which make graphene and its derivatives one of the most prominent material classes for future nanoelectronics.@xcite the vast range of possible applications is due to the high carrier mobility,@xcite and remarkably long spin lifetimes and phase coherence lengths , which are particularly valuable for quantum information processing.@xcite the peculiar electronic structure of gapless semiconductor graphene prevents electrostatic confinement due to klein tunneling and gives rise to unique transport properties.@xcite experimentally , graphene - based tunable nanodevices can be realized , as shown , e.g. , for graphene nanoribbons,@xcite interference devices,@xcite and graphene quantum dots.@xcite graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) play a particularly important role since they are often used in field - effect transistors ( fet ) setups where the current flow is regulated by a gate electric field .",
    "additionally , gated nanoribbons can also be used to create quantum dots . hereby , the spin qubits in quantum dots are a promising candidate for quantum information processing,@xcite for which graphene is better suited than iii ",
    "iv semiconductors due to its reduced hyperfine coupling and spin - orbit interaction.@xcite for nanoelectronics applications , the preferred width of a gnr is in the range of 13 nm as for wider ribbons the band gap diminishes.@xcite    for a proper theoretical description of gnr fet and gnr - based quantum dots , both the effect of an external electric field and the precise electronic structures of the ribbons have to be considered . in ribbons of small width the details of the termination and exact structure of the edges",
    "play an important role for ribbon s electronic structure due to the quantum confinement effects , which have to be properly taken into account .",
    "the two most common types of edge termination of the ribbons lead to very different electronic structures in the vicinity of the fermi energy : while armchair ribbons are insulating with a band gap of up to approximately 2.5 ev , zigzag ribbons exhibit metallic edge states.@xcite for the former , the band gap decreases with increasing width of the ribbon and oscillates in magnitude with a periodicity of three as more rows of carbon atoms are added.@xcite experimentally , armchair ribbons with the width of 1  nm with well - defined edges@xcite and fet with widths down to 2 nm have been realized.@xcite on the other hand , ribbons with the width of around 50 nm have been used to create quantum dots.@xcite    the sensitivity of the electronic properties of narrow gnrs to an external electric field and to the details of the structure , as well as the mechanism for the formation of the quantum dot states , calls for a description and analysis within the highly accurate density - functional theory techniques ( dft ) . in this work , we study the properties of narrow gnrs in an electric field , generated by finite gates , by employing a new scheme specifically designed for this purpose and realized within the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method .",
    "in contrast to common approaches , the latter scheme allows to consider any given distribution of charge in the gates , thus enabling the versatility necessary for studies of complex nanostructured devices from first principles . here",
    ", we describe the details of this approach as implemented within the flapw method,@xcite and study the development of the electronic structure and screening properties of narrow gnrs as the strength of the electric field is varied .",
    "we focus particularly on the emergence of the quantum - dot like states , localized under the gates , and analyze their spatial distribution and symmetry properties .",
    "in a realistic device the electronic properties of the graphene nanoribbon will be modified by gate electrodes . while more complex interactions between the gates and the graphene nanoribbon exist , the most prominent effect of the gates is the electric field they generate . these electric - field effects can be included in a calculation based on dft,@xcite and in the past several different implementations of external fields in dft codes have been reported . however , in contrast to most of these approaches , which model a situation in which the electric field is applied normally to a surface , the key effect of the gates we study is the field and potential distribution in the plane of the graphene ribbon .",
    "we use the film flapw method@xcite as implemented in the fleur code@xcite for our calculations . two slightly different schemes to include the electric fields of the gates have been tested in which the effect of the gates is modeled by : ( i ) a charged sheet far in the vacuum in which the charge varies parallel to the gnr or ( ii ) a plane in the vacuum at which a varying boundary condition to the coulomb potential is applied .",
    "while the second approach is closer to the picture of a metallic gate applying an electric field , the generation of the potential from a charge distribution is performed in all existing dft codes and , hence , the first approach is easy to implement .",
    "we discuss all details of the implementation of the gate electric field in the appendix .    for modeling the effect of a gate electrode on a gnr we have chosen a free - standing 13-carbon - atom - wide graphene nanoribbon of armchair type",

    "the dangling bonds are passivated using hydrogen leading to a ribbon which is about 5.1 nm long and 1.7 nm wide , consisting of 312 carbon and 48 hydrogen atoms .",
    "the setup is periodically repeated in @xmath1-direction to form an infinite ribbon .",
    "as our code requires a two - dimensional periodicity , we also have to repeat the ribbon in @xmath2 direction . a supercell approach with a separation of 5  between adjacent cells",
    "is used to simulate a single isolated gnr .",
    "the center of the gnr is sandwiched between positively charged top and back gates whose charge is compensated by negatively charged top and back gates such that both the gnr and the two charge sheets remain as a whole charge neutral . the positively charged gate has a size of @xmath3 @xmath4 and the distance between the gnr plane and the charge sheets is 7  . for simplicity , we used a homogeneous surface - charge - density distribution on the gates [ method ( i ) ] .",
    "however , for the dimensions of this system , the potential at the position of the plane of the gnr is qualitatively the same for a gate with constant potential  the potential only differs strongly close to the gate ( not shown ) .",

    "the field strength is low , while for the points in between the field is nearly in - plane and stronger .",
    "thus , the potential should cause a charge accumulation under the gate .",
    "figure [ fig : screening](a ) shows the gate potential along the center of the ribbon for a gate charge of @xmath11nm@xmath4 .",

    "the initial potential due to the applied electric field ( black solid curve ) gets reduced ( red dashed curve ) due to the screening by the electrons in the ribbon .",
    "this screening effect is determined by evaluating the potential of the self - consistent calculation . from the reduction ",
    "the blue dotted curve has been obtained by multiplying the red dashed curve by 3.8 to match the black solid curve  a static ( @xmath12 ) dielectric constant @xmath13 can be deduced for the center of the ribbon .",

    "if one compares the total electron density of this structure without field and with a field of 0.67  v /   ( this corresponds to a charge of @xmath21/nm@xmath4 on the gates ) , the charge accumulation and depletion can be visualized by a density - difference plot as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : eigen](a ) the bandstructure of the ribbon without field .",
    "the bandgap is about 0.9  ev and bounded by valence and conduction band states at the @xmath20 point . introducing an additional periodicity in @xmath1-direction by the field leads to a backfolding of the bandstructure along @xmath20@xmath22 .",
    "if the field is modulated with a periodicity of 51    ( 12 unit cells in @xmath1-direction ) , the backfolding occurs at the red lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen](a ) .",
    "the brillouin zone extends then from @xmath20 to @xmath23 . in the following we focus on the states at the @xmath20 point , since they form the valence and conduction band edge .",
    "switching on the electric field leads to a splitting or a shift of the eigenenergies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen](b ) : the two - fold degeneracy of the states at @xmath24  ev and @xmath25  ev , which results from the backfolding of the brillouin zone , is lifted and the bands split almost symmetrically , both for negative and positive fields . the slight asymmetry between positive and negative electric field",
    "is introduced by the shape of the gate electrode as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gnr](a ) .",
    "if there were just a one - dimensionally modulated field acting on the gnr , this asymmetry would vanish .",
    "the splitting can then be understood from the consideration of a system with just two eigenstates with energies @xmath26 and @xmath27 , perturbed by a periodic potential with fourier coefficients @xmath28 . at the @xmath29 backfolding of the bandstructure , the states split according to @xmath30 .",
    "as the states are degenerate , the splitting is linear in @xmath31 . in case of interacting states that are non - degenerate ,",
    "the evolution of these states starts parabolic at small fields and evolves into a more linear behavior at stronger fields ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "with increasing field strength the uppermost valence band states move up in energy , towards the fermi level , while the lowest conduction band states move down by a similar amount .",
    "their interaction causes again a deviation from the linear behavior and at a field strength corresponding to 0.4  v /   the first crossover of states occurs , i.e.  a valence band state becomes unoccupied while a conduction band state is populated . in order to get a better understanding of this scenario , we display the single - particle states in this energy region in fig .

    "[ fig : den - single](f ) gets occupied , which can be regarded as the second quantum dot state . as for atoms , one expects also for quantum dots states an increasing number of nodal planes for higher states with higher energy , which is indeed what one observes : the color of the isosurfaces in fig .  [ fig : den - single ] denotes the sign of the wavefunction , which allows to locate the nodal planes .",
    "the first quantum - dot state ( h ) has at the center one vertical nodal plane ( dashed green line ) and is not nodeless as one might have expected . for the next localized state ( f ) one sees in the charge density a horizontal nodal plane , while the state ( c ) has two : a horizontal and a vertical nodal plane .",
    "the state ( b ) seems to have two horizontal and the state ( a ) one horizontal and two vertical nodal planes .",
    "we have thus shown how under a gate electric field , localized states appear in the band gap ; those show a nodal structure as one expects for a quantum dot .",
    "the states still show the structure of the underlying lattice and are predominately formed by @xmath18 states as one can see in the charge density .",
    "besides armchair nanoribbons , also zigzag ribbons exist , which are known for their ( conducting ) edge states.@xcite those are located just above and below the fermi energy .",
    "the combination of both types of edge states could be useful for future nanodevices ; but missing atoms or sections with different edge terminations might also occur involuntarily during the preparation of nanoribbons .",
    "we have thus simulated an armchair ribbon of width 13 ( as above ) but with a zigzag section in the middle .",
    "for the calculation , a supercell with length of 51.3   and width of 25.8   has been used ; the positive gate charge has been placed at the center over and below the zigzag region ( @xmath33 @xmath4 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dens - zigzag](a ) shows ( for zero field ) the existence of an edge state in the zigzag section ; the highest occupied ( shown ) and the lowest unoccupied state have the same density but locally different phases . if one now turns on an electric field , the edge states gain density in the middle of the ribbon",
    "additionally , states with more density at the outside raise in energy , while more localized states get more localized and become lower in energy .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens - zigzag ] for an electric field of 1 ev /   ( maximal potential gradient before screening ; gate charge is @xmath34/nm@xmath4 ) : ( b ) shows a high lying state at zero field ( 0.87 ev above the fermi energy ) , which moves down in energy to the fermi energy in the electric field ; at the same time its density becomes more localized at the zigzag region , i.e. under the gate .",
    "a scheme to include arbitrary electrical fields has been introduced and its implementation for the film flapw method outlined .",
    "the scheme allows for neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions and for differently shaped gate electrodes .",
    "future use could encompass the calculation of the effects of an electrical field on adatom on films and a wide range other electric - field related phenomena .    the gate electric field",
    "was then applied to an armchair graphene nanoribbon ; the mostly in - plane field caused a charge accumulation under the gate . for small fields , the linear response of the electrons in the ribbon to the electric field allowed to determine a static dielectric constant of @xmath35 .",
    "the field also drove states into the zero - field gap ; as has been shown , the previously unoccupied states entering the gap region are localized under the gate .",
    "those states , mostly formed by @xmath18 orbitals , show the structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "however , they also feature a nodal structure as one would expected for quantum dots .",
    "the states have been obtained from an all - electron density - functional theory calculation , which makes a comparison to less precise techniques such as tight binding interesting ; those techniques have the advantage that much larger systems can be treated . additionally , the influence of the electric field on gnr consisting of zigzag with metallic edge states and semiconducting armchair sections has been shown , where the electric field moves states towards the fermi energy , which are localized under the gate .",

    "<S> quantum - dot states in graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) were calculated using density - functional theory , considering the effect of the electric field of gate electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the field is parallel to the gnr plane and was generated by an inhomogeneous charge sheet placed atop the ribbon . varying the electric field allowed to observe the development of the gnr states and the formation of localized , quantum - dot - like states in the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation has been performed for armchair gnrs and for armchair ribbons with a zigzag section . </S>",
    "<S> for the armchair gnr a static dielectric constant of @xmath0 could be determined . </S>"
