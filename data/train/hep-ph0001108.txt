    "at zero temperature and zero ( baryon number ) density , the chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is dynamically broken .",
    "it is generally believed that at sufficiently high temperature and/or density the qcd vacuum undergoes a phase transition into a chirally symmetric phase .",
    "this chiral phase transition plays an important role in the physics of neutron stars and the early universe and it may be realized in heavy - ion collisions . at finite temperature",
    "the lattice simulation is powerful to study the chiral phase transition at finite temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it is now developing also for finite chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "however , effective theories of qcd are still useful for various nonperturbative phenomena including the phase transition .",
    "recently , it has been argued that importance of a study of the phase structure , especially a position of the tricritical point , has been pointed out in ref .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite in which the interaction is induced by instantons and the random matrix model @xcite have shown almost the same results concerning the tricritical point .",
    "it is also interesting to study the possibility of color superconducting phase at high baryon density [ 2,48 ] .",
    "however we may neglect this phase in the high temperature region where we found the tricritical point . in this paper , we concentrate on the chiral phase transition between @xmath10 and @xmath11 using the effective potential and the qcd - like theory .",
    "one usually studies the phase structure of qcd in terms of the schwinger  dyson equation ( sde ) or the effective potential [ 913 ] .",
    "however , the use of the sde only is not sufficient for its study in particular when there is a first order phase transition ; then , we use the effective potential . the qcd - like theory provided with the effective potential for composite operators and the renormalization group is successful to study the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite .",
    "this type of theory is occasionally called _ qcd in the improved ladder approximation_. the phase diagram in the qcd - like theory has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the position of the tricritical point is largely different from that obtained from the njl model and the random matrix model .    in this paper",
    "we use a modified form of the cornwall  jackiw  tomboulis ( cjt ) effective potential @xcite which is convenient for a variational approach .",
    "the formulation is given for the case where the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken at zero temperature and density .",
    "we , then , consider the cjt effective potential in the improved ladder approximation at finite temperature and/or density .",
    "being motivated by refs .",
    "@xcite , we re - examine the chiral phase transition and phase structure in the chiral limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the effective potential for composite operators and extend it to finite temperature and density . in sec .",
    "iii we first determine the value of @xmath12 by a condition @xmath13 mev at @xmath14 and then calculate the effective potential at finite @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 numerically . using those results , we study the phase structure in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plain .",
