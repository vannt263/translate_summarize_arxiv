    "the franck - condon ( fc ) principle , which determines the relative intensity of the vibration - assisted electron transition spectrum , is of much significance in molecular physics  @xcite . in these excitation and de - excitation processes ,",
    "the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the overlap integrals between the initial and final vibrational states ( the fc factors ) .",
    "compared with the fast electronic transition , the vibrational motion is extraordinary slow . as a result , during the electronic transition , vibrational coordinates nearly keep stationary .",
    "this corresponds to a `` vertical transition '' picture on the effective vibrational potential energy surface , and is called fc effect .",
    "the fc principle was originally proposed by franck to study the mechanism of photon - induced chemical reactions  @xcite and later expanded to the semi - classical formulation by condon  @xcite .",
    "and then lax applied this principle to solid - state physics  @xcite .",
    "however , all the previous works focused on electron - phonon coupling system  @xcite .    in this paper , we will study the fc effect induced by spin - spin interaction for a model of a central spin in collective - spin environment , like a central spin in quantum dot ( qd )  @xcite or in nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the unavoidable hyperfine interaction between the central spin and the collective environmental spins is the chief culprit of decoherence of the interested central spin .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the effect of the spin - spin fc principle on the dynamics of the central spin . on the other hand , in an ideal environment with specific inter - spin coupling ( such as ising type ) , the central spin can be used as a probe to explore the supersensitivity of a quantum critical multi - spin system  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction has been tested in several experiments  @xcite and its robustness has been numerically shown as the longitudinal field ( equivalent to the tranverse hyperfine coupling in our model ) does not effect on the decoherence behaviour around the critical point  @xcite .",
    "we consider the model of a central spin immersed in an environment of nuclear spins . in general",
    ", the central spin can be a nuclear spin or an electron spin .",
    "the central spin is initially polarized by the crystal field in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "the collective environmental spins behave as the vibrational mode in conventional electron - phonon interaction model of fc effect .",
    "and the longitudinal hyperfine coupling between the central spin and its spin environment is analogous to the diagonal electron - phonon coupling , resulting in the effective hamiltonian of the environment spin being central - spin - dependent . due to this hyperfine coupling ,",
    "when the central spin is excited by the external field , the spin bath will be excited simultaneously and this co - excitation generates the collective - spin - based fc effect . and the fc factors , which were originally the overlap integrals between the initial and final displaced vibrational fock states , are defined as the overlaps of the rotated collective spin states in our system .",
    "an earlier paper investigated the spin fc effect , but it was only devoted to demonstrating the stokes shift in a spin - spin interaction system  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that work  @xcite , we study detailedly and systematically the collective - spin - based fc effect and reveal its underlying physical mechanism .",
    "we find that there exists the similar fc effect in our spin - spin interacting system . in zero temperature case ,",
    "the original lorentz absorption spectrum of a naked spin is shifted and split into few small peaks by the weak hyperfine coupling , just as same as the vibronic transition spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the relative transition intensity is determined by the fc factors . and",
    "the most probable transitions , which have largest fc factors , are ruled by the `` vertical transition '' mechanism . on the other hand , if the collective - spin environment is at finite temperature , the peaks of the absorption spectrum of the central spin are depressed and broadened significantly .",
    "especially , when the hyperfine coupling is strong enough , the excitation of the central spin is suppressed intensively .",
    "this behavior is called fc blockade .    in the next section",
