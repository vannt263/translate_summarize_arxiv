    "inclusive decays for heavy - quark hadrons such as @xmath1 mesons are computed in a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass using the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "decay rates are related to the discontinuity of scattering amplitudes at physical cuts , so the calculation is necessarily performed for time - like momentum transfer and is not a short - distance process for which the ope is valid .",
    "nevertheless , one can still use the ope for suitably averaged quantities .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath5 , the inclusive rate for @xmath6 , which is related to the discontinuity in the vacuum polarization amplitude @xmath7 along the real axis for @xmath8 .",
    "the operator product expansion can be applied to @xmath7 far away from the physical cuts , such as at complex @xmath9 , @xmath10 , to give @xmath7 as an expansion in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "analyticity can then be used to relate @xmath13 to an integral of the form @xcite @xmath14 thus smeared averages of @xmath5 can be computed using perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath12 corrections to these depend on the smearing width @xmath15 , and are not under control as @xmath16 . in practice @xmath15",
    "is made as small as possible while keeping the radiative corrections under control .",
    "typically @xmath15 is chosen to be @xmath17mev .",
    "one expects that perturbative computations agree with data , provided one averages over a large number of hadronic resonances .",

    "the total semileptonic decay rate @xmath23 automatically involves averaging over different hadronic states , and one expects that the ope computation for @xmath23 is valid .",
    "inclusive nonleptonic @xmath24 decays can also be computed using an ope @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is no variable such as @xmath20 to integrate over , so the computation has no intrinsic smearing .",
    "one must then make the assumption of local duality , that the quark and hadron computations agree at a single kinematic point . in the case of @xmath5",
    ", this would mean that one could compute @xmath5 for each value of @xmath25 .",
    "this is clearly false when there are narrow resonances ( e.g. , in the @xmath26 region ) , but is valid elsewhere because the large number of overlapping hadronic resonances provide a natural smearing mechanism .",
    "an important question is the extent to which local duality holds for nonleptonic @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "there is a long - standing claimed discrepancy between theory and experiment in the @xmath1 meson semileptonic branching ratio and in the @xmath27 to @xmath1 lifetime ratio , and the failure of local duality is one way to resolve these .    in this paper , we study the violation of local duality using the @xmath3 expansion of qcd @xcite . in this limit ,",
