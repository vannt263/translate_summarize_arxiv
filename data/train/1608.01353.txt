    "this work was motivated by a recent paper by eliahou  @xcite , which constitutes a remarkable contribution towards a better understanding of wilf s conjecture .",
    "much about the conjecture of wilf , so as references to the many papers devoted to the subject , can be found in eliahou s paper .",
    "to each numerical semigroup  @xmath0 , eliahou associated a number , which we denote by @xmath1 ( eliahou s notation was @xmath8 ) , and proposed as an interesting problem the characterization of the class @xmath9 of numerical semigroups . suggesting such a problem is not surprising , since he proved that the set @xmath10 consists of semigroups that satisfy wilf s conjecture .",
    "furthermore , he made use of that number to prove that all the numerical semigroups whose conductor is not bigger than the triple of the multiplicity satisfy wilf s conjecture , which is a great result .",
    "eliahou observed that it seems to be very rare that a numerical semigroup belongs to @xmath11 , where , as observed , any possible counterexample to wilf s conjecture must belong . despite giving infinite families of semigroups in @xmath11 ,",
    "we tend to agree with him .",
    "a ( pseudo- ) random search through all the numerical semigroups would hardly give an example . according to eliahou",
    ", fromentin discovered the first @xmath2 examples through exhaustive search among the numerical semigroups of genus up to @xmath5 , which are more than @xmath4 .",
    "this shows that the probability of a numerical semigroup taken at random from the set of numerical semigroups of genus up to @xmath5 to have negative eliahou number is approximately @xmath12 .",
    "our strategy has been to do a pseudo - random search , but making some naive guesses that allowed us to highly reduce the search space or even to discard huge amounts of candidates without even looking at them . for some of the guesses we were able to sketch simple proofs that no candidate was wrongly rejected , for others",
    "not so simple and for many others we have not even convinced ourselves that a proof can be done .",
    "notice that in our strategy this is not an important point ( we are not even concerned with some kind of uniform distribution ) : once we find an example we can easily verify that it is in fact an example .",
    "we observe that the @xmath2 available examples have been crucial for the initial guesses we made .",
    "nevertheless , finding the first not known examples has not been an easy task , and crucial role was played by computational tools , either in terms of hardware ( the search for examples used a large number of hours in several computers ) or in terms of software ( the  @xcite package  @xcite has been used ) .",
    "after , having a large amount of examples at our disposal we looked for patterns .",
    "the  @xcite package  @xcite played an important role in this part , by allowing us to have an automatic pictorial view of the semigroups .",
    "a particularly simple family emerged and it is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "the structure of the paper briefly follows . besides some motivation and introducing some terminology , to which the first two sections are dedicated",
    ", the paper has several other sections .",
    "section  [ sec : sp ] is the heart of the paper . in it",
    "we show the existence of numerical semigroups with arbitrary large negative eliahou number . to be precise , for each even positive integer @xmath13 we give a numerical semigroup @xmath14",
    "whose eliahou number is @xmath15 .    in section  [ sec : sptau ]",
    "we slightly modify @xmath14 , by adding a kind of remainder @xmath16 .",
    "the numerical semigroup obtained is denoted @xmath17 .",
    "this construction leads us to conclude that every integer is the eliahou number of a numerical semigroup .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : sijptau ] , we give an infinite family of numerical semigroups @xmath18 whose eliahou number is the same as the eliahou number of @xmath17 . we thus conclude that for each given integer there are infinitely many numerical semigroups whose eliahou number is that integer .",
    "we prove that for any even positive integer @xmath13 and non negative integers @xmath19 and @xmath16 , the semigroup @xmath20 satisfies wilf s conjecture .    in an appendix section",
    "we discuss a problem concerning the minimum possible genus of a numerical semigroup having a given eliahou number .    in another appendix section",
    "we give a variety of examples , which essentially may be seen as a source of counter - examples .",
    "we explicitly state some remarks that are merely counter - examples to some questions that could be seen as natural . on the other hand",
    ", the examples given may help in the process of finding right questions to work on .    throughout the paper we derive some interesting consequences of our results .",
