    "<S> it may be assumed that individuals make vaccination decisions based on their past experiences ( i.e. , use inductive reasoning ) rather than based only on the current influenza epidemiology ( i.e. , use deductive reasoning ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we present and analyze for the first time several inductive reasoning games that may apply to influenza vaccination .    </S>",
    "<S> the first inductive reasoning model was introduced in 1994 with the _ el farol bar problem _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly present this problem as a paradigm for inductive reasoning games . consider a group of @xmath0 individuals acting in their own self - interest . </S>",
    "<S> each week , every individual independently decides whether or not to go to the el farol bar . </S>",
    "<S> an individual deems it worth going if fewer than a critical fraction of the total number of individuals @xmath0 are present . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the bar is crowded and the individual would rather stay at home . </S>",
    "<S> no individual knows the bar attendance in advance , nor do they communicate with others ; thus , the decision of going to the bar can not be made in a logical deductive fashion . instead , an individual would predict / guess the bar attendance and base their decisions on these predictions . </S>",
    "<S> once the bar attendance is known , an individual evaluates and adapts their predictions for future decisions . </S>",
    "<S> this continuous adaptation of one s behavior based on expectations about future collective behavior is called _ inductive reasoning _ and applies in many instances where logical deductive reasoning fails either in principle or due to bounded rationality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inductive reasoning games have been applied to financial markets where traders decide to buy or sell a certain asset whose price is determined by their collective action @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a market with more buyers than sellers it is rewarding to be in the minority of sellers to benefit from a higher price of the asset . </S>",
    "<S> such games have been called _ minority games _ @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that there are striking similarities between the el farol bar problem and the dynamics of the market of voluntary vaccination against pathogens that do not induce permanent immunity . </S>",
    "<S> for concreteness of discussion , we consider influenza vaccination . </S>",
    "<S> the influenza vaccine is effective for one year only , thus individuals must decide every year whether to vaccinate or not @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may be assumed that individuals act in their own self - interest trying to avoid infection preferably without having to vaccinate . </S>",
    "<S> the yearly vaccination coverage ( i.e. , the proportion of the population vaccinated each year ) is determined by the collective participation of the individuals . </S>",
    "<S> compartmental models of disease transmission @xcite have shown that there exists a _ critical coverage level _ such that : if the coverage is below the critical level , an epidemic will occur , otherwise epidemics will be prevented . however , whether or not a vaccination coverage larger than the critical level is likely to be reached every year in a voluntary vaccination market is a question that we address here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , inductive reasoning games provide a very suitable modeling background for approaching this question . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a inductive reasoning game of influenza vaccination based on the analogy between the situation at hand and the el farol bar problem . </S>",
    "<S> the critical vaccination coverage will play the role of the critical attendance fraction ( i.e. , _ crowding threshold _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> individuals that go to the bar correspond to individuals that vaccinate . </S>",
    "<S> individuals that stay at home correspond to individuals that do not vaccinate . for the bar problem </S>",
    "<S> : individuals would go to the bar for entertainment , but if the bar is crowded , they would rather stay at home . for the vaccination game : individuals would vaccinate to avoid infection , but if the coverage is larger than the critical level , they no longer need to vaccinate to avoid infection . however , there are also distinctions between the two games . </S>",
    "<S> when an individual does not vaccinate and the critical coverage is not reached , they still have a non - zero probability of avoiding infection due to peer vaccination ( i.e. , they are protected by _ herd immunity _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the bar problem , an individual always regrets not going to the bar if the critical attendance is not reached . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an individual - level model that describes the adaptive dynamics of vaccination decisions in a population of non - communicating individuals acting in their own self - interest ( i.e. , _ selfish _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model tracks both individual - level vaccination decisions and behavior as well as the resulting population - level variables such as influenza prevalence and vaccination coverage levels .    from the public health point of view , our work has important consequences @xcite . in the united states , </S>",
    "<S> influenza vaccination is voluntary and the demand for influenza vaccines ( 70 to 75 million vaccine doses per season ) is generally met . </S>",
    "<S> the vaccine is very effective in offering protection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to evolution of the virus and waning immunity , the vaccine is good only for one influenza season . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , the vaccination coverage has steadily increased @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even so , every year , up to 25% of the united states population is infected with influenza @xcite causing 36,000 deaths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the national health objectives of the united states is to further increase the vaccination coverage @xcite which currently is below the healthy people 2010 objective @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is important to understand the vaccination dynamics and what incentives could be used to increase the vaccination coverage in order to control the epidemic .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows . in sections [ sec:1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we introduce and briefly analyze our individual - level vaccination model with no public health program ( _ basic model _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to derive a dynamical system for the expectations of the variables of the model . </S>",
    "<S> then , we address deviations from this _ mean - field _ limit by adding small gaussian noise to the dynamical systems . using the same approach , in section [ sec:2 ] we discuss analytical results regarding the basic model with superimposed vaccination incentives which results into two public health programs . </S>",
