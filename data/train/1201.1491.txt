    "expects the field theory description to reduce to the thin shell description .",
    "indeed , one can formally expand the einstein - scalar equations in powers of the thickness and obtain the thin shell equations at lowest order in this expansion.@xcite nonetheless , one can not simply assume the validity of such an expansion . instead in a field theory one gets to choose initial data and then the field equations give the results of the evolution of those data .",
    "thus the thin shell approximation is a good approximation for a thick domain wall to the extent that the evolution of initial data that are well approximated by the thin shell treatment continue under evolution to be well approximated by this treatment . to test this approximation , we will choose initial data for a spherically symmetric thick domain wall , perform a numerical evolution , and compare to the corresponding thin shell approximation .",

    "we will use the standard @xmath0 potential @xmath9    for simulations in spherical symmetry , one often takes the area radius as one of the spatial coordinates and chooses time to be orthogonal to this radial coordinate.@xcite however , this coordinate system breaks down when a trapped surface forms and thus can not follow the evolution after black hole formation .",
