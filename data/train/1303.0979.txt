    "the fact that hessj1641@xmath0463  is found within the bounds of a radio snr immediately suggests the possibility of the detection of a new vhe snr .",
    "however , the existing x - ray observations do not provide additional support to this scenario due to the lack of detection of an extended x - ray feature at the position of hessj1641@xmath0463 .",
    "in addition , the larger extension of snr g338.5 + 0.1 as compared to hessj1641@xmath0463 , and the relatively old age of the snr inferred from its physical size of @xmath2630 pc suggests that the emission might not be necessarily connected with the snr but rather with a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) at its center , driven by an yet undetected pulsar . from energy considerations ,",
    "any of the faint x - ray sources of the area near hessj1641@xmath0463  can be its counterpart in the pwn scenario .",
    "in particular , the flux density level of the nearest found x - ray source , ( source l ) is a factor @xmath26 15 less energetic when compared with the energy flux density of hessj1641@xmath0463  at the vhe energies . yet",
    ", several associations of `` dark '' tev sources and weak x - ray synchrotron pwn have been established , were ratios of tev / kev energy flux much larger have been observed ( e.g. hess j1303 - 631 @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility could be that hessj1641@xmath0463  is a binary binary system , similar to hess j0632 + 057 @xcite .",
    "hard spectral indexes ( @xmath29 ) are found in those systems , similar to those measured in hessj1641@xmath0463 . in a @xmath30-ray binary scenario , however , a certain degree of flux variability in both x - rays and tev @xmath30-rays is expected , although this variability could appear in a relatively large range of time - scales . in this regard",
    ", the lack of such variability features does not permit to further constrain the @xmath30-ray binary scenario based on the temporal distribution of the tev datasets .",
    "a flux of @xmath2610@xmath31 erg @xmath22 s@xmath23 may be expected from an x - ray faint binary system similar to hess j0632 + 057 if located at the estimated distance of snr g338.5 + 0.1 ( 11 kpc ) .",
    "massive stars that could be tracers of the location of a @xmath18-ray binary position were investigated , but none were found .",
    "however , the lack of an obvious optical counterpart could be explained due to the high optical extinction expected given both the large distance and the position of the source , close to the galactic plane .",
    "the excellent capabilities of h.e.s.s . have enabled the serendipitous discover a new tev source showing one of the hardest spectral indices found so far .",
    "the inspection of astronomical catalogues and archival x - ray observations do not provide an obvious counterpart to the vhe source but reveal two potential , but weak , x - ray counterparts .",
    "the spectral and morphological characteristics of hessj1641@xmath0463 , as well as its location induce to think it could be most likely a snr or a pwn , but other source types like a binary can not be excluded with the existing data and therefore the source remains unidentified .",
    "further observations , in particular with high resolution x - ray instruments , are encouraged for the proper identification of this new vhe source .                        the support of the namibian authorities and of the university of namibia in facilitating the construction and operation of h.e.s.s .",
