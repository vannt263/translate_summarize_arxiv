    "mathematical modeling of epidemics arguably began with the pioneer work of ross @xcite and developed considerably ever since ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "especially significant contribution was made by kermack and mckendrick @xcite , two students of ross , who considered the situation of microparasite infection , where contacts between individuals are made according to the law of mass - action , all individuals are identical , the population is closed , and the population size is large enough to apply a deterministic description ( for a brief review see @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , if it is assumed that the individuals are infected for an exponentially distributed period of time , then a usual sir model in the form of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) can be written down for the sizes of susceptible , infective and removed classes .    since the work of kermack and mckendrick a great deal of mathematical models",
    "were suggested that relax one or more assumptions that led to the kermack - mckendrick model .",
    "a substantial part of this work was devoted to incorporate heterogeneity into the mathematical models , which is also the main subject of the present text . in what follows",
    "we retain the assumptions of random mixing , no inflow of susceptible or infected hosts , exponentially distributed infectious period , and validity of deterministic description .",
    "specifically , we will look into heterogeneity in disease parameters ( such as susceptibility to a disease ) ; disease parameters are considered as an inherent and invariant property of individuals , whereas the parameter values can vary between individuals .",
    "we analyze heterogeneity that was termed `` parametric '' by dushoff @xcite not addressing important topics of heterogeneity mediated by a structured variable , such as explicit space or age structure .",
    "the most common way to take into account parametric heterogeneity is to divide population into groups @xcite .",
    "an important disadvantage of the subgroup approach is that heterogeneity within a group can not be incorporated .",
    "another approach , which we also pursue , is to consider the population as having a continuous distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or a very large number of subgroups as it was done by may et al .",
    "@xcite ( eventually they used a continuous gamma - distribution ) .",
    "our approach to formulate mathematical models is close to that applied in , e.g. , @xcite , where known experimental data forced the authors to take into account heterogeneity among hosts in their susceptibility to the virus among other key details , and a simple sir model was adjusted to account for new information .",
    "the major novelty of the present text is to introduce the well developed theory of heterogeneous populations into the epidemiological modeling .",
    "using simple models we are able to obtain known results with less effort , and , more importantly , produce new analytical results .",
    "in particular , we show that any heterogeneous sir model can be reduced to a homogeneous one with a nonlinear transmission function , and present the exact form of this function .",
    "it turns out that widely applied nonlinear transmission function in the form of power relationship , @xmath0 , can be a consequence of the intrinsic heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity parameters . for a heterogeneous sir model the equation of the final epidemic size is found .",
    "the explicit form of the final epidemic size emphasizes and illustrates the fact that the goal to model the evolution of a heterogeneous population for a long time can be accomplished only if the exact initial distribution is available .",
    "any moment - closure methods may lead to erroneous estimates .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the basic models and discuss various assumptions that might lead to them . in section 3",
    "we review the necessary analytical tools from the theory of heterogeneous populations . in section 4 a homogeneous model that is equivalent to the heterogeneous one",
    "is explicitly constructed , and it is shown that the former has a nonlinear transmission function ; moreover , the well known power transmission function is shown to be a consequence of the initial gamma - distribution . in section 5 the influence of heterogeneity on the disease course is studied for an sir model with distributed susceptibility , in particular , the final size of an epidemic is found for an arbitrary initial distribution .",
    "section 6 devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "finally , in appendix we collect the definitions of the probability distributions used throughout the text together with some auxiliary facts from the general theory of heterogeneous models .",
    "suppose that each individual of a ( sub-)population has its own value of a certain trait ( which can be , e.g. , susceptibility to a particular disease , social behavior , infectivity , or a hereditary attribute ) that describes his or her invariant property and has a marked influence on the disease course ; that is , the key parameters that determine disease evolution depend on the trait values and we can speak of the trait distribution or the parameter distributions ( in general , we speak of a distribution when no ambiguity is expected ) .",
    "the trait value remains unchanged for any given individual during the time period we are interested in , but varies from one individual to another .",
    "any changes of the mean , variance and other characteristics of the trait distribution in the population ( or the parameter distributions ) are caused only by variation of population structure .",
    "such situation is obviously closer to the reality then the usual assumption of the population uniformity in the sir - like models described by odes .    for the moment",
    "we assume that the susceptible subpopulation is heterogeneous , and denote @xmath1 the density of susceptible individuals at time @xmath2 having trait value @xmath3 ( i.e. , the size of subpopulation of susceptible hosts having trait values in the range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is approximately equal to @xmath5 , and the total size of the susceptibles @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the set of trait values ) . assuming that the subpopulation of infectives is homogeneous ( under the modeling situation ) , the total size of the population is constant",
    ", the disease course keeps within the simplest situation `` susceptible''@xmath8``infective''@xmath8``removed '' , the contact process is described by the so - called mass - action kinetics ( i.e. , the contact rate is proportional to the total population size @xmath9 @xcite ) , and that the rate of change in the susceptibles is determined by the transmission parameter , which is a function of trait values , we can write down the following equation for the change in the susceptible subpopulation having trait value @xmath3 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the size of the subpopulation of infectives , and @xmath12 incorporates information on the contact rate and the probability of a successful contact . hereinafter we assume that the trait that characterizes susceptible individuals is the susceptibility to the disease , although it can be assumed that different individuals have different contact rates ( in the latter case it becomes difficult to interpret the equation for the infectives , see below ) .    the change in the infective class , if the length of being infective is distributed exponentially with the mean time @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 where we used the useful notations @xmath15 hence , @xmath16 is the mean value of the function @xmath12 , and @xmath3 has the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath17 for any time moment @xmath2 .",
    "we need to supplement the model - with the initial conditions @xmath18 and with the third equation for the removed @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the initial sizes of the susceptibles and infectives respectively , and @xmath22 is the given initial distribution .",
    "the model - is the basic model we study in this paper .",
    "this model was formulated from the first principles , as it was done for conceptually similar models in @xcite for the transmission of virus in gypsy moths , in @xcite for the effect of antimicrobial agents on microbial populations , in @xcite for the spread of hiv in the human population , and in @xcite for a class of sis models ( we note , however , that in the last two examples the frequency - dependent transmission was employed @xcite , and the heterogeneity of the contact rates was modelled ) .    the model - can be also deduced from the general epidemic equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the expected infectivity of an individual that was infected @xmath25 units of time ago while having trait value @xmath26 towards a susceptible with trait value @xmath3 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath27 , and set @xmath28 after some algebra we obtain - ( see also @xcite ) . as a side remark",
    "we note that letting @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the heaviside function , we obtain the model studied in  @xcite .",
    "it can be also assumed that the population of infectives is heterogeneous .",
    "now let @xmath12 be the infectivity of an individual with trait value @xmath3 , and @xmath31 be the density of the infective hosts with trait value @xmath3 at time moment @xmath2 , @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the susceptible hosts are homogeneous .",
    "the change in the infective subpopulation should incorporate the law that specifies which trait value is assigned to a newly infected individual , and can be described by the following equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability that a newly infected individual gets trait value @xmath3 if infected by an individual with trait value @xmath35 .",
    "the change in the population @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where now @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the need to specify function @xmath34 precludes the interpretation of the function @xmath12 in section [ s1 ] as the heterogeneity in the contact rates .",
    "it was assumed that the infectives are all identical , and thus the supposition that an individual that have had the trait value @xmath3 turns into another identical infective host is not warranted , at least within the framework of the simple model - .    a variety of choices for the function @xmath34 is possible , but we especially interested in the particular case when a newly infected individual gets the same trait value that was possessed by the individual who passed the infection , namely @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dirac delta function ( this is similar to the assumptions made in @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the equation simplifies to the equation , which is very similar to : @xmath42    model - is another example of a simple mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease in a closed population with heterogeneities .",
    "the list of possible models can be easily extended .",
    "for instance , it is straightforward to assume that the parameter @xmath43 is not constant for the infected individuals , but rather is distributed with a known initial distribution . in this case the equation for the infectives takes the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is now constant .",
    "another obvious generalization is to assume that several model parameters are distributed .",
    "models - and - are infinite - dimensional dynamical systems where the evolutionary operator specifies complex transformations of the initial distributions .",
    "such models are less amenable to qualitative , quantitative , or numerical analysis than their finite - dimensional analogs formulated in terms of odes .",
    "a usual practice is to formulate an infinite - dimensional system of odes for which some approximations methods ( e.g. , assuming that the initial distribution is close to the normal distribution @xcite ) , moment - closure ( @xcite and @xcite ) , or numerical methods ( @xcite ) can be applied .",
    "we show below that in some particular cases , when the analytical form of the heterogeneous models meets certain requirements , the initial model can be reduced to a low - dimensional ode model , which , in turn , can be effectively analyzed .",
    "to keep the exposition self - contained and for the sake of convenience of references we briefly survey the necessary results from @xcite .",
    "we present the results in the form suitable for our goal noting that more general cases can be analyzed @xcite . for the proofs we refer to @xcite , where similar models are considered .",
    "some additional facts are given in appendix .",
    "let us assume that there are two interacting populations whose dynamics depend on trait values @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the densities are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the total population sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "obviously , more than two populations can be considered , or some populations may be supposed to be homogeneous ; we choose two not to be drowned in notations .",
    "assume next that the net reproduction rates of the populations have the specific form which is presented below : @xmath52,\\\\      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial      t}n_2(t,\\omega_1)&=n_2(t,\\omega_2)[f_2(n_1,n_2,\\bar{\\varphi}_1(t))+\\varphi_2(\\omega_2)g_2(n_1,n_2,\\bar{\\varphi}_1(t ) ) ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are given functions , @xmath54 are the mean values of @xmath53 , and @xmath55 are the corresponding pdfs , @xmath56 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath53 , considered as random variables , are independent .",
    "the system plus the initial conditions @xmath57 defines , in general , a complex transformation of densities @xmath58 . for the approach to study such systems based on the analysis of abstract differential equations in banach spaces",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "another approach to analyze models in the form was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the latter is more attractive because eventually one has to deal with systems of odes of low dimensions ( examples of model analysis are given in @xcite ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath59 the moment generating functions ( mgfs ) of the functions @xmath53 , @xmath60 are the mgfs of the initial distributions , @xmath56 , which are given .",

    "theorem [ th1 ] gives a method of computation of the main statistical characteristics of @xmath53 ; the analysis of model - is reduced to analysis of ode system , , , the only thing we need to know is the mgfs of the initial distributions .",
    "it is worth noting that the evolution of distributions can also be analyzed @xcite .    concluding this sections we note that , with obvious notation changes , models - and - fall into the general framework of the master model .",
    "we start with the equation , other equations in the system can be quite arbitrary , e.g. , the full system can contain the class of exposed or several infective classes .",
    "here we show that the heterogeneous model that contains as a modeling ingredient can be reduced to a homogeneous model with a nonlinear transmission function whose explicit form is determined by the initial distribution .",
    "this result is close to the analysis in @xcite where it was argued that the model with heterogeneities can be encapsulated in a homogeneous model . due to the fact that the model considered in @xcite is substantially more general than the models we consider here , no explicit formulas were found . in the case of model nonlinear transmission function",
    "can be found in the exact form for different initial distributions .    according to theorem [ th1 ]",
    "we can rewrite equation in the form @xmath73 where dots denote equations that govern the dynamics of other subpopulations , e.g. , these can be usual equations for infected and removed classes .",

    "was frequently used as a bilinear function of infective and susceptible populations : @xmath104 .",
    "in addition to this it is usually argued that there are a variety of reasons that the standard bilinear form may require modification , including the assumption of heterogeneous mixing @xcite .",
    "we refer to a review paper on the subject @xcite for a general account of different models for incidence rates , while noting that one of the most widely used models has the form @xmath105 and is of direct interest to our study .",
    "the incidence rate in the form was first used in @xcite , with the restriction that @xmath106 , but generally it is only required that @xmath107 , see also @xcite .",

    "consequently , it turns out that the power relationship , at least for the case @xmath123 , can be explained on the mechanistic basis by the inherent heterogeneities of the population .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the case of proportional mixing ( frequency - dependent transmission ) knowledge of only the initial variances of the parameter distributions does not allow inference on the short ran behavior @xcite .",
    "one of the main characteristic of sir models is the final size of the disease , which is often expressed in the number ( or proportion ) of susceptibles that never get infected . for the kermack - mckendrick model @xmath140 it",

    "the heterogeneity of the population has direct impact on the final size of the disease since equation depends on the initial distribution in contrast to the homogeneous analogue @xmath170 ( surprisingly , the last formula is valid under variety of different conditions @xcite ) .     versus the initial variance of the parameter distribution @xmath171 for four different initial distributions , @xmath172 is the same in all cases .",

    "this is true , e.g. , for two gamma - distributions :    assume that we have model - with two initial gamma - distributions with parameters @xmath183 and @xmath184 such that @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",

    "_ the last proposition can be extended to other initial distributions , e.g. , it holds for wald distribution , for a uniform distribution and some others .",
    "however , for any distribution that is not determined by its first two moments ( i.e. , that depends on more than two parameters ) an analogous proposition is no longer true .",
    "here we have presented several results concerning the course of a disease in a closed heterogeneous population , where heterogeneity is mediated by invariable traits whose distributions are determined by population structure at every time moment .",
    "one of the purposes of the present text is to introduce in the area of epidemiological modeling the general technics of the theory of heterogeneous populations @xcite which allows reduction of the initial infinite - dimensional dynamical system to an ode system of a low dimension .    a usual strategy in the literature when analyzing systems similar to - is to consider an infinite - dimensional system of odes where the variables can be moments or cumulants of the corresponding distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and then analyze this system , or consider one of many possible moment - closure strategies to extract valuable information .",
    "having the general theory outlined in section [ s2 ] and the known results from the literature , we can critically discuss the latter and be prepared to possible pitfalls .",
    "for example , in @xcite the equation for the final epidemic size was obtained by using two different strategies : first , an initial gamma - distribution was assumed and analytical treatment was applied , and second , using the procedure suggested in @xcite , an approximation method was used in which the infinite - dimensional system of odes was replaced with two equations under the assumption that the coefficient of variation is constant .",
    "it is not surprising that dwyer et al .",
    "obtained identical results because the gamma - distribution , according to the theory of heterogeneous populations , is the only continuous distribution which does not change its shape during the system evolution , and keeps the coefficient of variation constant ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , the conclusion that `` ... the assumption of gamma - distributed susceptibility is not strictly necessary to derive equation [ for the final epidemic size ] '' is not valid in many situations .",
    "another initial distribution , how it is shown by , can yield another equation for the final epidemic size and , consequently , can produce significant discrepancy with the moment - closure approximation suggested by dushoff @xcite .    the well known fact from the theory of heterogeneous populations that to model the system dynamics for a substantial time period we need to know the _",
    "exact _ initial distribution implies that any results obtained for an epidemic in a heterogeneous population on the ground of knowledge of only several first moments of the initial distribution have to taken with extreme care .",
    "one , two , or more first moments of the initial distribution can be insufficient or even misleading .",
    "we also note that the short run behavior can be predicted when we have information only on several first moments ( section [ s5 ] ) .",
    "another initial distribution which was used in the literature is the normal distribution @xcite . for the normal distribution we have that @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the @xmath195-th cumulant . combining the last property with the fact that the initial normal distribution remains normal within the framework of heterogeneous models",
    "we obtain that @xmath196 holds for any @xmath2 ( see appendix ) .",
    "this was used in @xcite to obtain an explicit solution to the equation @xmath197 here @xmath198 is the number of cells at time moment @xmath2 , which are killed by antimicrobial agents with the kill rate @xmath199 , and @xmath200 is a constant ( notations are changed from the original ) .",
    "first we note that , using theorem [ th1 ] , we obtain explicit solution of this equation for an arbitrary initial distribution of the kill rate : @xmath201 where @xmath202 .",
    "second , the results from sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] can not be applied to the normal distribution because this distribution is defined from @xmath203 to @xmath149 and thus the corresponding mgf does not have an inverse .",
    "which is more important , however , the total system dynamics can be influenced by these negative kill rates even if they occur with vanishingly small probability ( we note that this issue is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such influence can be found in @xcite where infinitely large growth rates occurring with small probabilities drive the population to explosion .",
    "therefore any approximations based on an initial normal distribution in a situation where parameter can take only nonnegative values should be taken with care .    summarizing the main results we can assert that the theory of heterogeneous populations can be successfully applied to many different mathematical models in epidemiology .",
    "examples are given in section [ s2 ] .",
    "in many simple cases the original model can be reduced to a model described by odes , which simplifies the analysis .",
    "the law of mass action for a distributed susceptibility model implies a nonlinear incidence function in a homogeneous model .",
    "moreover , one of the well known transmission functions , power relationship , follows in exact form from the initial gamma - distribution , at least in the case when exponents exceed one ( see section [ s4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a mechanistic derivation has been given to the transmission power function , which was shown previously approximate real data with high accuracy .",
    "the short term behavior of the models considered can be approximately described knowing only two first moments of the initial distribution , whereas the long - term behavior depends on the exact initial distribution and can vary significantly ( section [ s5 ] ) even for the distributions whose several first moments are identical ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) .",
    "it is a tempting challenge to include various demography processes to the analyzed models .",
    "the main obstacle is the need to specify the function @xmath204 similar to the one used in @xmath205 .",
    "the delta - function yields the models that can be analyzed using the general approach from section [ s2 ] but it is usually difficult to interpret the underlying assumptions .",
    "these problems are the subject of ongoing research .",
    "in appendix we collect the definitions of the distributions used throughout the main text .",
    "the definitions are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to that we list some facts concerning evolution of these distributions if they are used as the initial distributions for the models studies in the text . everywhere below it",
    "is assumed that @xmath206 .",
    "inasmuch as we are interested in characteristics of distributions depending on time , the following formula is very useful ( see @xcite ) : @xmath207 where @xmath208 in the solution of the corresponding auxiliary differential equation ( see theorem [ th1 ] ) , @xmath209 is the mgf of the parameter distribution at time @xmath2 .",
    "equation shows that the mgf at any time instant can be expressed using the initial mgf .",
    "it follows from that for @xmath212 the distribution does not change its form , i.e. , it is gamma - distribution with parameters @xmath91 and @xmath213 .",
    "the mean and variance of the distribution are given by @xmath214 note that at any time moment the coefficient of variation is constant : @xmath215 . actually , gamma - distribution is the only continuous distribution whose coefficient of variation remains constant with time within the framework of heterogeneous models .",
    "the pdf of inverse gaussian ( wald ) distribution with parameters @xmath97 and @xmath92 is @xmath216^{1/2}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{\\nu}{2\\mu^2\\omega}(\\omega-\\mu)^2\\right\\},\\quad      \\omega>0,\\quad \\mu,\\,\\nu>0.\\ ] ] the mgf of wald distribution is given by @xmath217^{1/2}\\right)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] again the distribution remains wald distribution with parameters @xmath218^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\,\\nu,\\ ] ] and temporal characteristics of the distribution are @xmath219^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\quad \\sigma^2(t)=\\frac{\\bar{\\beta}^3(t)}{\\nu}\\,,\\quad cv^2=\\frac{\\bar{\\beta}(t)}{\\nu}\\,.\\ ] ]      sometimes it is useful to study evolution of distribution with compact support .",
    "a good candidate in this case is the family of beta - distributions with pdf @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the beta - function .",
    "the initial mean and variance are @xmath222 unfortunately in the case of beta - distribution it is impossible to write down the mgf , and , correspondingly , the temporal characteristics of the distribution . in a special case @xmath223 we have a uniform distribution on @xmath224 $ ] .",
    "equation shows that in this case for @xmath212 the distribution is no longer uniform but turns into truncated exponential distribution .",
    "the pdf of log - normal distribution defined on the nonnegative half - axis @xmath225 with parameters @xmath97 and @xmath92 is @xmath226^{-1}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(\\ln\\omega-\\mu)^2}{\\nu^2}\\right\\},\\quad      \\omega\\geqslant0,\\,\\mu>0,\\,\\nu>0.\\ ] ] the initial characteristics are @xmath227 as in the case of beta - distribution we can not present explicit formulas for the mgf and other characteristics .",
    "we note that this distribution can be used only if @xmath228 for @xmath212 , otherwise the integral in the mgf diverges .",
