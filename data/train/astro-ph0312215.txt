    "we also quote the approximate abell classes of our sample in this table , based on the conversions given by @xcite , in our cosmology .",
    "we note however that these conversions are arbitrary , and hence we base our quoted abell classes on both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 statistics .    a wide variety of environments can be seen amongst the objects in the sample .",
    "p09104 + 4109 resides in an abell 2 cluster , in agreement with previous results @xcite . for the remaining objects ,",
    "three reside in poor environments , and two , f10026 + 4949 and f10119 + 1429 , reside in clusters , of abell class 1 and 0 respectively , though we note that the detection of clustering for f10119 + 1429 is marginal , at @xmath55 .",
    "excluding p09104 + 4109 , the error weighted mean clustering amplitude for the remaining 5 objects is @xmath56mpc@xmath3 .",
    "we can compare the values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 to each other , as these quantities have been used by many previous authors , and a well defined relation has been found between them .",
    "@xcite derive @xmath57 .",
    "in figure [ bggn05 ] we plot this relation , together with @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 for the objects in our sample , and the conversions between @xmath5 and abell class given by @xcite .",
    "we also plot the best fit linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for our data .",
    "the best fit is well matched to the relation derived by @xcite and the objects in the sample follow this relation closely , hence we conclude that our computed values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 are reasonable .",
    "the errors quoted in table [ clusterstats ] for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 statistics are only the counting errors , and do not include three further , potentially important sources of error . in this section , we discuss these three error sources in turn .",
    "the first of these is the luminosity function assumed in calculating the @xmath5 statistic . due to the uncertainties in the high redshift @xmath0-band lf used in this paper",
    ", this is an important issue to address .",
    "@xcite have examined the sensitivity of @xmath7 to the form of the lf , and find that an error in the assumed value of @xmath58 of up to @xmath59 will still yield essentially the same results .",
    "similarly , an error in @xmath60 of up to @xmath61 will only affect @xmath7 by at most @xmath62 .",
    "although the k band lf is not well constrained at the redshifts of our targets , we do not expect that the true lf differs from our assumed lf by such gross margins , and therefore we conclude that uncertainties in our computed @xmath5 statistics due to the assumed lf are at most @xmath63 .",
    "the second of these error sources is the method used to compare the data to the luminosity function in calculating the @xmath5 statistic .",
    "this can be done in two ways .",
    "the data can be @xmath64-corrected to the rest - frame @xmath0-band , and compared to the @xmath0-band luminosity function given by @xcite , or the data can be compared directly to the j band luminosity function presented by @xcite , without applying a @xmath64-correction , as observed frame @xmath0-band approximately samples rest - frame j band at the redshifts of our sample .",
    "both methods have advantages and disadvantages ; the rest - frame @xmath0-band is a less contaminated tracer of evolved stellar mass than the j band , but suffers from the extra uncertainties introduced by applying @xmath64-corrections .",
    "although we chose to @xmath64-correct our data to the rest - frame @xmath0-band , we also examined the effect of comparing our data directly to the rest - frame j - band luminosity function , without applying @xmath64-corrections .",
    "we computed @xmath5 and @xmath65 without applying @xmath64-corrections , and using the j - band luminosity function from @xcite , and found that the @xmath5 values were within 1@xmath66 of the values computed using @xmath64-corrections and the @xmath0-band luminosity function for all the objects except f10119 + 1429 , which was within 1.5@xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , each object still resided within the same type of environment as before , with p09104 + 4109 , f10026 + 4949 and f10119 + 1429 residing in clusters ( with the same significance of detection of clustering ) and the other 3 objects lying in the field .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath65 were however in all cases slightly higher using the j - band luminosity function and no @xmath64-corrections , with f10026 + 4949 and f10119 + 1429 predicted to ( just ) lie in abell 2 clusters .",
    "we conclude that using the @xmath0-band luminosity function with @xmath64-corrections , or just the j - band luminosity function , will not significantly change our results , and that our choice of using the @xmath0-band luminosity function with @xmath64-corrections was the most conservative .",
    "the third of these error sources is the choice of cosmology .",
    "whilst both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are _ relatively _ insensitive to the choice of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the sensitivity to @xmath69 is marked , particularly in the range @xmath70 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ hubble_effect ] , where we have plotted @xmath5 as a function of @xmath69 for f10026 + 4949 . by varying @xmath69 over a relatively small range ,",
    "the effect on @xmath5 is dramatic , changing from @xmath71 for @xmath72 to @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "most current measurements of @xmath69 produce values in the range 70 to 75 , albeit with a significant error ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath75 , and therefore our derived clustering amplitudes , are therefore conservative .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that , whilst there are further , significant sources of error than the poisson errors on the derived clustering statistics , none of these sources of error should significantly change our results .",
    "furthermore , we have in all cases adopted the most conservative method possible in computing the clustering amplitudes , making it highly unlikely that any of our objects that we infer to lie in clusters actually reside in the field .",
    "our sample of five objects ( excluding p09104 ) , although small , exhibit a wide variety of environments , from poor environments to abell @xmath76 clusters .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is a wide variety of environments amongst objects with high levels of ir emission at @xmath77 generally , although a larger sample would be required to confirm this .",
    "this variety of environments is not seen amongst local ulirgs , which are generally not found in rich environments @xcite .",
    "the mean environmental richness of our sample , at @xmath56mpc@xmath3 , is higher , at just over @xmath78 significance , than the galaxy - galaxy correlation statistic both locally @xcite and at moderate redshifts @xcite , though we note that the latter study measured values of @xmath79 up to redshifts of only @xmath80 .",
    "we infer that , in going from @xmath81 to @xmath77 the environments of ir - luminous galaxies become more diverse , and that the mean environment becomes richer than that of normal galaxies both locally and at moderate redshifts .",
    "this is supportive of the idea that a wider variety of galaxy formation processes are important amongst the ir - luminous galaxy population at high redshift than locally , such as hierarchical buildup or encounters in clusters . indeed , one object in our sample , iras f10026 + 4949 , may be an example of such a galaxy .",
    "this source harbours both a starburst and an agn @xcite , and lies in a rich cluster . from hst imaging",
    ", this source also possesses multiple very close companions @xcite .",
    "it is thus an excellent candidate for being a cd galaxy in the process of formation in a cluster at @xmath82 , and may be the higher redshift analogue of the clustered ir - luminous active galaxies p09104 + 4109 and p18216 + 6419 @xcite .",
    "since environments are independent of orientation , we can compare the environments of our sample to those of other classes of active galaxies at comparable redshifts to examine possible relationships between hlirgs and other agn classes .",
    "the environments of agn over a wide redshift range have been studied by many authors in efforts to disentangle the myriad agn taxonomy .",
    "radio loud qsos ( rlqs ) and radio galaxies ( rgs ) are found in a diverse range of environments , from the field to abell class 2 and greater , at both low and high redshift @xcite .",
    "overall , rlqs and rgs appear to prefer moderately rich environments on average , of around abell class 0 . determining whether or not there is evolution in the environments of rlqs or rgs with redshift is difficult , due to gravitational lensing and selection biases , but from recent results it appears that there is no significant difference in rlq and rg environments at @xmath83 @xcite . for radio quiet quasars ( rqqs ) a broadly comparable picture has now emerged .",
    "rqqs are found in a similarly diverse range of environments to rlqs , from the field to abell class 2 or richer , over a wide redshift range @xcite .",
    "indeed , the most recent results , based on deep optical imaging , show that the environments of rqqs and rlqs at moderate redshifts are statistically indistinguishable @xcite . at @xmath84",
    "there is as yet no clear consensus , but the environments of rlqs and rqqs at these redshifts do not appear to be significantly different @xcite .    in the local universe , it was initially suggested that ulirgs as a class are precursors to optically selected qsos , although later results show that this is probably true for only a small subset of the ulirg population @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in their environments , as locally ulirgs and qsos reside in different environments , with ulirgs generally lying in the field and qsos lying in moderately rich environments on average , with a diverse range .",
    "we can compare the range of environments in our sample of hlirgs to those of qsos at comparable redshifts to see if this is also true at high redshift .",
    "the diverse range of environments seen in our sample of hlirgs is qualitatively similar to the range seen in rlqs and rqqs , and our mean value for @xmath5 is comparable to the mean galaxy - quasar correlation statistic , @xmath85 , for rlqs and rqqs at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ qsocomp ] , where we plot clustering amplitudes vs. redshifts for our hlirgs , together with a representative sample of clustering amplitudes for qsos from the literature @xcite , converted to our cosmology .",
    "the error bars on the qsos have been intentionally omitted for clarity , but are comparable in size to the error bars on the hlirgs .",
    "we note that the clustering measures were derived using different data , with our clustering amplitudes derived from @xmath0-band data and the clustering amplitudes from the other samples derived from multiband optical data , however it is unlikely that this will introduce any systematic biases between the datasets .",
    "therefore , we extrapolate from this that evolutionary links between ir - luminous galaxies and optically selected qsos may become stronger with increasing redshift .",
    "furthermore , we postulate that , at approximately @xmath4 , the range of galaxy evolution processes driving ir - luminous galaxy evolution caused by the greater diversity in environments is similar to the range driving qso evolution .",
    "we note that one object in our sample , lbqs 1220 + 0939 , is a qso from the large bright quasar survey @xcite that was only later discovered to be hyperluminous in the ir ; the selection criteria for this object therefore make it unsuitable for determining evolutionary connections between hlirgs and qsos .",
    "even with lbqs 1220 + 0939 removed however , the sample still contains the same diverse range of environments , and the mean clustering amplitude is still comparable to that of qsos at similar redshifts .",
    "we can take this one step further via a comparison of hlirg and optically selected qso host galaxies .",
    "qsos at all redshifts are thought to lie in luminous , @xmath86 host galaxies , with elliptical hosts becoming more prevalent for both rlqs and rqqs with increasing optical nuclear luminosity @xcite .",
    "conversely , although local ulirgs are thought to evolve into ellipticals with a few also passing though a qso phase , are thought to be mergers between ( optically ) sub-@xmath87 galaxies , with the majority of ulirgs themselves also being sub-@xmath87 @xcite . for the hlirgs in our sample ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "one object , f14218 + 3845 , is a qso with a host magnitude that suggests ( similarly to the other qsos in the sample ) the host is a very luminous , massive system @xcite .",
    "for the two non - qsos in our sample , the picture is less clear , with one object ( f00235 + 1024 ) being 0.5 magnitudes dimmer than @xmath88 , but the other ( f10026 + 4949 ) over a magnitude brighter than @xmath88 .",
    "we note however that the @xmath89-band magnitudes of those hlirgs without a qso presented by @xcite are , with the exception of f00235 + 1024 , much brighter than @xmath90 . whilst more data",
    "is evidently needed , it appears reasonable to assume that ir - luminous galaxies may become more similar to qso hosts with increasing redshift .",
    "whilst this reinforces the idea that evolutionary links between ir - luminous galaxies and qsos become stronger with increasing lookback time , it also suggests that , at @xmath91 , a greater number of ir - luminous galaxies evolve directly into optically selected qsos than locally .",
    "we have presented deep wide - field k - band imaging of the fields of six hyperluminous infared galaxies , and quantified their environments using the @xmath5 galaxy - hlirg correlation amplitude , and the @xmath6 clustering statistic .",
    "we conclude the following :    \\1 ) the hlirgs in our sample reside in a diverse range of environments , from the field to abell 2 clusters .",
    "the mean clustering level of the sample , at @xmath92 , and the range of environments , are both significantly greater than those of the most luminous ir galaxies locally .",
    "we infer that , at high redshift , the galaxy evolution processes driving the evolution of ir - luminous galaxies are more diverse than at low redshift , and include mergers between gas - rich spirals in the field , but also include encounters in clusters and hierarchical buildup .",
    "\\2 ) the mean clustering amplitude of the sample , and the range in environments , are comparable to those of qsos over a similar redshift range .",
    "we postulate from this that , at @xmath91 , the range of galaxy evolution processes driving ir - luminous galaxy evolution is similar to the range that drives qso evolution .",
    "when combined with the similarities between hlirg host galaxies and qso host galaxies at the same redshifts , this further suggests that a greater fraction of ir - luminous galaxies evolve directly into optically selected qsos at high redshift than do locally .",
    "we thank carol lonsdale and margrethe wold for illuminating discussion , and the referee for a very helpful report .",
