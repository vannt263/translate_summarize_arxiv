    "the production and suppression of @xmath0 mesons on a nuclear targets have been intensively studied over the last thirty years , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "most investigations of these issues have been carried out in the field of relativistic proton  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions ( see , e.g. , [ 128 ] ) .",
    "the main goal of the studies in this field was to get valuable information about a possible restoration of chiral symmetry above some critical temperature and density accompanied by the phase transition from composite hadrons to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "and the suppression of @xmath0 yield observed in heavy ",
    "ion collisions at sps and rhic is recognized , beginning from the work [ 29 ] , as one of the most promising signals of the transition of ordinary hadronic matter to a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons .",
    "in addition to the above prominent prospect , in - medium properties of charmonium states , the strength of the inelastic @xmath0nucleon interaction are of further interest in view both of the feasibility of an experimental observation of the one of the new kinds of exotic nuclei  narrow bound @xmath0nucleus states [ 30 ] and of gaining more insight into the dynamics of low - energy qcd in the charm and hidden charm sectors [ 31 , 32 ] .",
    "what concerns the experimental situation , up to now a wide variety of high statistics @xmath0 data samples have been collected in proton  nucleus and heavy  ion experiments na38 [ 6 ] , na50 [ 7 ] and na60 [ 8 ] at the cern - sps , in phenix and star experiments [ 9 ] at rhic as well as in recent alice experiments [ 10 ] at the cern - lhc .",
    "moreover , nowadays there are charmonium results in @xmath3 collisions at initial proton beam energy of 920 gev from hera - b experiment at the hera proton ring of the desy laboratory [ 11 ] and from e866 experiment at fnal at beam energy of 800 gev [ 12 ] .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been proposed ( see , e.g. , [ 15 , 1328 ] ) for the description of @xmath0 production in @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions in the sps , rhic and lhc energy domains .",
    "the current theoretical and experimental status of the study of charmonium production in high - energy nuclear collisions is given in [ 33 ] .",
    "due to almost negligible initial state interactions , the photon ",
    "nucleus reactions represent also an important and more transparent compared to proton  nucleus and heavy  ion collisions tool to investigate the charmonium in - medium properties , its interaction in cold nuclear matter .",
    "several @xmath0 production experiments , using nuclear targets , have been performed at high photon energies , starting with 20 gev ( see refs .",
    "[ 3440 ] ) .",
    "the existing data on @xmath0 creation off only two nuclei ( d , be ) below 20 gev come from cornell [ 41 ] using 9.311.8 gev photons and from slac [ 42 ] from 1321 gev photons .",

    "so , it is not much is known presently in the region of the photon energies around the threshold energy of 8.2 gev .",
    "all above calls for a new measurements in this region of photon energies .",
    "various theoretical aspects of @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei at high energies are discussed , e.g. , in [ 4451 ] .",
    "a particular interest was shown in recent years in the study of the charmonium production and suppression in proton  nucleus [ 5254 ] and antiproton  nucleus [ 5560 ] as well as in photon ",
    "nucleus [ 61 , 62 ] reactions at energies close to the kinematic thresholds on free nucleons .",
    "this interest was triggered by the fact that these reactions are planned to be investigated in the near future in the cbm and @xmath6anda experiments at the constructed fair facility in germany [ 63 ] as well as at the upgraded up to 12 gev cebaf accelerator in the usa [ 64 ] . since direct measurement of the fundamental @xmath0nucleon inelastic cross section",
    "is not possible , analysis of data , collected in these experiments , will allow to perform a much improved determination of it because in low - energy collisions , contrary to the high - energy ones , the @xmath0 mesons are produced with low momenta relative to the nuclear medium at which their formation time ( or color transparency ) effects are expected to be insignificant and , therefore , the situation with the scattering of a full - sized charmonium ( but not a compact @xmath7-pair ) on an intranuclear nucleons with the full @xmath0 meson  nucleon cross section will be realized .",
    "the primary goal of the present work is to extend the first collision model based on the nuclear spectral function [ 54 ] that has been adopted by us for the description of the a dependences of the absolute and relative ( transparency ratio ) @xmath0 meson yields as well as its excitation function in @xmath3 collisions near threshold to @xmath0producing electromagnetic processes . in this paper",
    "we present the estimates for the above observables from @xmath2 reactions in the near - threshold energy region obtained within this extended model . in view of the expected data from the jlab upgraded to 12 gev",
    ", these estimates can be used as an important tool for determining the genuine @xmath0nucleon absorption cross section as well as for understanding the properties of charmonium in nuclear medium and the role played by the various nucleus - related effects in the @xmath0 production near threshold .",
    "since we are interested in the near - threshold incident photon energy region up to 11 gev , we have taken into consideration the following elementary processes , which have the lowest free production threshold ( @xmath8 8.2 gev)we can neglect in the energy domain of our interest the following two - step @xmath0 production processes with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons in an intermediate states : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ( @xmath16% ) , @xmath17 ( @xmath18% ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20% ) and @xmath21 due to larger @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 production thresholds in @xmath22 collisions10.1 , 10.3 and 10.9 gev , respectively.]@xmath5 : @xmath23 @xmath24 in line with [ 54 ] , in the following calculations we will include the medium modification of the @xmath0 mesons , participating in the production processes ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , by using , for reasons of simplicity , their average in - medium mass @xmath25 defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the local nucleon density and @xmath29 effective mass inside the nucleus , respectively .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 we can readily rewrite equation ( 3 ) in the form @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the @xmath29 free space mass , @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 are the average and saturation nucleon densities , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that , for example , for target nuclei @xmath36c , @xmath37ca , @xmath38nb and @xmath39pb the ratio @xmath40 is approximately equal to 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "we will use the respective above values throughout the following study . in it in line with [ 54 ] for the @xmath0 mass shift at saturation density @xmath41 we will employ the five following options : i ) @xmath42 , ii ) @xmath43 mev , iii ) @xmath44 mev , iv ) @xmath45 mev , and v ) @xmath46 mev .",
    "it should be pointed out that according to the theory expectations [ 6570 ] the @xmath0 mass shift at normal nuclear matter density is either very small or @xmath47 -20 mev due to a weak coupling of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 quarks to the nuclear medium .",
    "however , in reality it is unclear presently which shift is the correct one .",
    "therefore , to extend the potential range of applicability of our model we will perform the calculations of the @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections off nuclei in the scenarios with possible charmonium mass shift @xmath41 ranging from -150 mev to 0 . as in [ 54 ] , we will ignore the medium modification of the outgoing nucleon mass in the present work .",

    "accounting for that the coherence length @xmath73 [ 59 ] , we get that at the photon energy @xmath74 gev , accessible at the jlab upgraded to 12 gev , it is about of 0.5 fm .",
    "this is substantially less than the nucleus radius , which is to say that in the near - threshold @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei the @xmath7-pair is created essentially right at the location of the nucleon that it scatters from .",

    "it can be seen that the possibility of studying the @xmath29 mass shift from the excitation function measurements is feasible only in the range of mass shifts of -50 mev and more at far subthreshold beam energies ( @xmath12457 gev ) , while smaller mass shifts will be not accessible by these measurements .",

    "also we have calculated the absolute and relative excitation functions for @xmath0 production off @xmath36c and @xmath39pb target nuclei at near - threshold incident photon energies of 511 gev .",
    "it was found that the absolute and relative @xmath0 yields at incident energies of 911 gev , on the one hand , is practically not influenced by formation length and mass shift effects and , on the other hand , it is appreciably sensitive to the charmonium  nucleon absorption cross section .",
    "this gives a nice opportunity to determine it experimentally studying the above observables in this energy domain .",
    "it was also shown that the absolute and relative excitation functions for @xmath0 production off nuclei is well sensitive to the possible @xmath0 in - medium mass shifts in the range of -50 mev and more at subthreshold beam energies , and this offers the possibility to investigate such shifts via @xmath0 production on light and heavy target nuclei at these energies .",
