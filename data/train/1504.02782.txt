    "as a fundamental byproduct of star formation , dust plays an important role in our understanding of heavy element synthesis in stars , the dispersal of such elements into the ism , and our interpretation of the stellar populations of galaxies given the wavelength - dependent effects of dust absorption .",
    "the latter aspect is encoded in the shape of the attenuation curve @xcite , which conveniently parameterizes the complexities of the dust properties and spatial distribution of that dust with respect to the stars in galaxies .",
    "observations of the milky way and nearby galaxies have yielded detailed information on the shape of the dust extinction and attenuation curves , respectively , in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "armed with such information , one can then deduce the amount of attenuation at any given wavelength ( i.e. , the dust obscuration ) and recover the bolometric star - formation rate ( sfr ) , accounting for the starlight absorbed and re - radiated by dust .    understanding the shape of this curve takes on added importance for evaluating the global energetics and stellar populations of galaxies at high redshift , where direct measures of dust emission from far - infrared ( far - ir ) data become observationally inaccessible for typical star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the stacking of mid- and far - ir data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the _ herschel space observatory _ has proved beneficial for our understanding of the _ average _ dust properties of typical @xmath16 star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "ir observations of lensed star - forming galaxies can lend insight into the dust emission from individual @xmath16 ( and fainter ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these samples remain small . these stacking and lensed galaxy studies lack the precision required to uncover changes in dust properties and dust / stars geometry from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "further , while the uv continuum slope ( e.g. , @xcite ) has been shown by numerous studies to be a reasonable proxy for dust attenuation in star - forming galaxies in the local and high - redshift universe ( e.g. , @xcite , among many others ) , and while it can be measured for individual galaxies to very faint magnitudes at high redshift @xcite , it is nonetheless also sensitive to age , metallicity , and star - formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also below ) .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the uv slope can be complicated by the presence of the @xmath11 absorption feature @xcite . despite these issues ,",
    "the uv slope is by far the most heavily used dust indicator at high redshift given that it can be measured easily for individual star - forming galaxies , particularly those selected by their rest - frame uv colors .",
    "separately , existing studies of the shape of the attenuation curve at @xmath17 have relied either on spectroscopy over limited wavelength ranges , indirect inferences based on sed modeling of broad- and medium - band data and/or sfr comparisons @xcite , or have been investigated for galaxies over a limited range of spectral shape ( e.g. , galaxies with weak balmer and 4000 breaks ) and uv luminosities with an explicit assumption for the shape of the intrinsic spectrum @xcite . what have been needed for a more robust study of the attenuation curve",
    "are indicators of dust and sfr at high redshift that : ( a ) can be measured for individual @xmath16 galaxies at high redshift ; ( b ) are less attenuated than the uv luminosity ; ( c ) are less sensitive to age and star - formation history ; and ( c ) probe star formation on the shortest timescales .",
    "when coupled with samples of galaxies with near - ir spectra and broad- and intermediate - band photometry spanning the uv through near - ir wavelengths , these sfr / dust indicators can be used to address the shape of the attenuation curve of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the hi recombination line luminosities and their ratios have been considered the `` gold standard '' for measuring sfrs and dust attenuation in local galaxies @xcite . in particular , the balmer ( and higher series ) transitions in star - forming galaxies arise from the hii regions generated by the most massive o stars ( @xmath18@xmath13 ) and therefore trace the sfr averaged over timescales of just a few myr , making these tracers insensitive to the star - formation history on longer timescales . in nearby galaxies , these lines are easily observable from the ground to faint limits , and",
    "they are less affected by attenuation than uv emission .",
    "the higher series lines , including pa@xmath3 ( @xmath19@xmath20 m ) and br@xmath21 ( @xmath22@xmath20 m ) , are particularly useful indicators as their relatively long wavelengths imply negligible dust absorption . however , these features are weak relative to the balmer lines and , at @xmath17 , shift into the mid - ir where current instrumentation has been insufficient to detect the lines for all but the most luminous and strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies @xcite .    until recently , obtaining measurements of nebular recombination ( other than ly@xmath3 )",
    "has been prohibitive for faint galaxies at redshifts @xmath23 as these lines are shifted into the near - infrared ( near - ir ) where the terrestrial background is substantially higher than in the optical , with a color of @xmath24mag .",
    "deep ground - based narrowband imaging @xcite , and space - based grism spectroscopy afforded by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) wfc3 camera @xcite have begun to advance the study of nebular line emission ( particularly h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 ) in intermediate - redshift galaxies ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "nonetheless , such studies are generally limited to detecting high equivalent width lines , do not allow for the separation of lines close in wavelength ( e.g. , h@xmath3 and [ nii ] ) , or have a low resolution ( @xmath26 ) with a limited wavelength range that hinders the determination of physically important line ratios and widths .",
    "moderate - resolution near - ir spectroscopy exists for both uv - selected star - forming galaxies @xcite and near - ir - selected samples of massive ( @xmath27@xmath13 ) galaxies @xcite , yet these samples are quite small and typically do not cover both the @xmath28 and h@xmath4 lines . in cases where both lines were targeted ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the h@xmath4 line is commonly undetected given the depths of previous spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "the advances enabled with the new generation of multi - object near - ir spectrographs on 8 - 10m - class telescopes have begun to remedy these past deficiencies in high - redshift near - ir spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to this end",
    ", we have begun the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey @xcite , conducted with the recently - commissioned multi - object near - ir spectrograph mosfire @xcite on the keck  i telescope .",
    "mosdef aims to characterize the sfrs , dust attenuation , chemical content , ism physical conditions , dynamics , stellar populations , and black hole accretion activity of a large sample of @xmath29 _ h_-selected galaxies and agn in the redshift range @xmath30 , corresponding to the peak of star formation ( see review of @xcite ) and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this study",
    ", we use a sample of 224 galaxies with measurements of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission lines from the first two years of the mosdef survey to provide a direct measurement of the shape of the attenuation curve over the full wavelength range from the uv through near - ir for typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "our analysis marks a significant improvement over existing studies because : ( a ) we consider galaxies with a large range in spectral shapes ( from very blue and dust - free star - forming galaxies to very dusty and highly star - forming ones ) ; ( b ) we use an indicator of dust , namely the balmer decrement , which is sensitive to the reddening of the ionized gas and thus is physically distinct from the shape of the sed ( and thus less sensitive to the details of the star - formation history and age of the stellar population ) , and which can be measured for individual galaxies in our sample ; ( c ) our method of computing the attenuation curve is model - independent in that we make no assumption of the shape of the instrinic sed  rather , we use the data themselves to establish the how galaxy spectral shapes vary with increased dust attenuation ; and ( d ) the extensive multi - wavelength photometry affords us the ability to measure the shape of the attenuation curve at long wavelengths and , thus , the normalization of the curve .    in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we introduce the mosdef survey and the basic measurements including line fluxes , stellar population parameters , and sfrs .",
    "section  [ sec : effectofdust ] presents a discussion of the effects of dust on the stellar continuum and the derivation of the attenuation curve .",
    "the implications for the attenuation curve on our inferences of the stellar populations and sfrs , as well as the total attenuation of the stellar continuum and ionized gas , in distant galaxies are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] . throughout",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and a cosmology with @xmath32kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "line wavelengths are in vacuum .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the mosdef survey is being conducted using the mosfire spectrograph @xcite on the 10 m keck i telescope .",
    "this recently commissioned instrument enables the simultaneous near - ir spectroscopy of up to @xmath35 ( with typically 30 ) galaxies across a @xmath36 field of view .",
    "mosfire provides a wavelength coverage from @xmath37 to @xmath38@xmath20 m with a spectral resolution of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ bands , respectively .",
    "details of the survey , observations , and data reduction are provided in @xcite , and below we summarize the salient aspects relevant for this analysis , which uses the current data from the first two observing seasons of the survey .",
    "catalogs including ground- and space - based photometry from @xmath42 to @xmath43@xmath20 m , provided to us by the 3d - hst grism survey team ( pi : van dokkum ; @xcite ) , were used for target selection @xcite .",
    "these catalogs are based on sources detected in a weighted combination of the _ hst _ f125w , f140w , and f160w images in the five fields of the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite ) : cosmos , egs , goods - north , goods - south , and uds .",
    "the _ targeting _ catalogs include photometric redshifts and , where available , _ hst _ grism redshifts @xcite and external spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we restricted the targeting catalogs to include only those galaxies with photometric and/or grism or external spectroscopic redshifts in the three ranges @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where the various strong nebular emission lines of interest , including [ oii]@xmath47 , [ oiii]@xmath48 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath3 , and [ nii]@xmath49 , fall in the _ y _ , _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ atmospheric windows .",
    "targets are selected to fixed _",
    "h-_band magnitude limits of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , for the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 redshift ranges , respectively , to ensure a roughly consistent stellar mass limit of @xmath53@xmath13 across the three redshift ranges .",
    "for brevity , we refer to these as the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 samples . in this analysis",
    ", we consider only galaxies from the two lower redshift ranges , where both the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 lines are covered .",
    "targets were prioritized for spectroscopic observations based on two primary criteria .",
    "first , bright galaxies were up - weighted relative to fainter galaxies to ensure a statistical representation of rarer , massive galaxies .",
    "second , within a given magnitude range , objects were prioritized according to whether they had external spectroscopic redshifts , grism redshifts , photometric redshifts toward the center of the redshift ranges specified above , and photometric redshifts at the edges of the redshift ranges , in that order .",
    "the sample characteristics , success rate , and comparison of the spectroscopic sample to the parent sample are presented in @xcite .",
    "masks were observed using an abab dither pattern with @xmath57 width slits for @xmath58hrs each in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ filters for the @xmath59 sample ; and @xmath60hr each in the _ y _ , _ j _ , and _",
    "filters for the @xmath54 sample .",
    "our observations were taken with a typical seeing of @xmath61 .",
    "data reduction and spectral extraction were accomplished using a custom idl pipeline and interactive software @xcite .",
    "the prioritization and exposure time strategy have proved highly successful , with a @xmath62 spectroscopic confirmation rate on average per mask , and a @xmath63 success rate for objects at the faint limit of our @xmath59 sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : bd_vs_lha ] shows the spectroscopic redshift distribution of 259 galaxies ( excluding x - ray and ir - selected agn ; @xcite ) in the two lower redshift ranges targeted with mosdef thus far .",
    "slit loss corrections have a particular bearing on our analysis , as they are required to ensure accurate flux ratios between lines taken through different photometric filters and observed under different weather conditions .",
    "response corrections of the spectra were performed using telluric standard star observations , and an initial flux calibration is implemented by forcing the spectra of a bright `` slit star '' placed on each of the science masks to match the star s broadband photometry . however , the typical seeing of our observations is such that most of the targeted galaxies are spatially resolved and thus can not be treated as point sources when correcting for the loss of flux outside the slit apertures .",
    "thus , we modeled the f160w light profiles of each of our galaxies using a two - dimensional rotated elliptical gaussian which , when convolved with the seeing disk and integrated through the slit , yields an estimate of the fraction of flux lost outside the slit , relative to the fraction lost for the slit star .",
    "the efficacy of this procedure is evaluated by comparing the spectroscopic magnitudes of galaxies detected in the continuum with their broadband magnitudes .",
    "our slit loss correction procedure yields an absolute spectral flux calibration that is typically within @xmath64 of that predicted from the photometry , with a dispersion of roughly the same order .",
    "line measurements were performed by first estimating an initial redshift based on the highest signal - to - noise ( @xmath2 ) line for each galaxy , and then fitting gaussian functions at the observed wavelengths of all other lines .",
    "we allowed for a linear fit to the continuum underlying each line , and the [ oii]@xmath65 and h@xmath3+[nii]@xmath66 lines were fit using double and triple gaussian functions , respectively . to estimate line flux errors ,",
    "the spectra of each galaxy were perturbed 1000 times according to their error spectra and all the lines were remeasured from these realizations .",
    "the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 line fluxes were corrected for underlying balmer absorption arising primarily from the atmospheres of a stars . as the continuum",
    "is generally undetected in the mosdef spectra , we estimated the balmer absorption from the stellar population model fits to the galaxies , as discussed in the next section .",
    "for each model fit , we measured the absorbed flux relative to the continuum . generally , the corrections reach peak rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath67 and @xmath68 for h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 , respectively , at an age of @xmath69myr . for a constant star - formation history , the equivalent widths equilibrate to @xmath70 for older ages .",
    "the typical corrections to the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission line fluxes are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . the corrected h@xmath3/h@xmath4 ratios for our sample are shown in figure  [ fig : bd_vs_lha ] .",
    "the random uncertainties in the balmer absorption line fluxes were estimated by calculating the dispersion in the absorbed fluxes for model stellar population fits to the photometry perturbed many times according to the photometric errors .",
    "the uncertainties in the absorbed fluxes are @xmath73 and much smaller than the typical @xmath74 uncertainties in the emission line flux measurements , and therefore we chose not to include the additional random error of the absorbed fluxes in our analysis .",
    "it is useful to assess whether the 46 galaxies with @xmath75@xmath76 upper limits in h@xmath4 have distinctive properties relative to those of the 213 h@xmath4-detected galaxies .",
    "the 46 h@xmath4-undetected galaxies have lower limits in h@xmath3/h@xmath4 that span the full range observed for the h@xmath4-detected galaxies , and the broadband seds for the former are otherwise unremarkable compared to the latter .",
    "moreover , the frequency with which the h@xmath4 line is significantly affected by strong skylines is much higher ( 37 out of 46 , or @xmath77 ) for the h@xmath4-undetected galaxies than for the h@xmath4-detected galaxies ( 60 out of 213 , or @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , the h@xmath4 non - detections can at least partly be attributed to the fact that the galaxies lie at redshifts where h@xmath4 happened to fall on or close to a strong skyline .    to further investigate any systematic differences between these 46 galaxies and the rest of the sample , we constructed weighted average spectra of the h@xmath4-detected and -undetected galaxies and measured the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 fluxes in these combined spectra .",
    "the weighting of individual spectra when computing the average is simply @xmath79 , where @xmath80 if the value of the error spectrum at wavelength @xmath81 .",
    "the h@xmath4-detected and -undetected galaxies have @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , after correcting for the mean balmer absorption in these galaxies .",
    "this difference is smaller than the dispersion in the mean balmer decrements obtained when we bootstrap resample the galaxies contributing to the mean stacks .",
    "the galaxies with undetected h@xmath4 have an average balmer decrement that is similar to that of the h@xmath4-detected galaxies , implying that they suffer the same degree of obscuration on average . only those galaxies with @xmath84@xmath76 detection of h@xmath4 ( and h@xmath3 )",
    "are considered in the derivation of the attenuation curve , but we specifically include the sample of h@xmath4-undetected galaxies throughout the paper as necessary .      to aid our analysis , we modeled the stellar populations of galaxies in our sample to derive sed - based sfrs , color excesses , ages , and stellar masses .",
    "the basic procedure was to model the multi - wavelength photometry of the galaxies using a suite of @xcite stellar population models for different star - formation histories , ages , and reddening ; the latter assumes the @xcite attenuation curve , but we consider other attenuation curves below .",
    "the photometry is corrected , if necessary , for the contribution from the strongest emission lines measured in our survey , including h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , [ oiii]@xmath85 , and [ oii]@xmath47 .",
    "we modeled the stellar populations using constant , declining , and exponentially rising star - formation histories with e - folding times of @xmath86myr , and generally adopted the exponentially rising histories as the default for reporting results from the fitting . in the case of 14 galaxies ,",
    "exponentially declining models were adopted as they yielded better fits to the rest - uv photometry .",
    "incorporating the parameters obtained for a constant star - formation history does not alter our analysis or conclusions . in the modeling , we allowed the age to vary from @xmath87myr ( approximately the dynamical timescale ; e.g. , @xcite ) to the age of the universe at the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "reddening in the range @xmath88 was considered .",
    "we adopted the parameters corresponding to the model that gave a minimum @xmath89 relative to the photometry .",
    "errors in the best - fit parameters were derived by perturbing the photometry assuming a gaussian distribution of full - width - half - max equal to the photometric uncertainties .",
    "each of these realizations of the photometry were then refit to find the best - fit model , and the errors in best - fit parameters were taken to be the values that encompassed @xmath90 of the simulations .    of the 259 galaxies in our sample ,",
    "35 ( 31 h@xmath4-detected and 4 h@xmath4-undetected ) galaxies had noisy photometry relative to the best - fit model and were excluded from subsquent analysis .",
    "thus , the final sample consists of 224 galaxies , with 182 h@xmath4-detected galaxies and 42 h@xmath4-undetected galaxies .      as in @xcite , we define the _ balmer optical depth _",
    "@xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the _ difference _ in optical depths measured at the wavelengths of h@xmath4 and h@xmath3 , with the usual definition : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the observed and intrinsic intensities , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath92 is directly related to the color - excess , @xmath96 . objects with measured h@xmath3/h@xmath97 , the theoretical minimum value in the absence of dust for case b recombination and @xmath98k @xcite , are assigned @xmath99./h@xmath4 is insensitive to the electron density , varying by less than @xmath100 from @xmath101 to @xmath102@xmath103 . ]",
    "the default measurements we use for the sfrs come not from the sed fitting , but from the h@xmath3 flux measurements .",
    "the latter are more immune to the degeneracies inherent in sed modeling , less affected by extinction than the rest - uv , and trace the `` instantaneous '' sfr .",
    "we used the @xcite relation to convert h@xmath3 luminosities to sfrs , assuming a @xcite imf .",
    "these observed sfrs were then corrected for attenuation by assuming an attenuation curve ( @xmath104 ) and nebular color excess ( @xmath105 ) . in most previous investigations at",
    "_ high redshift _ , the attenuation curve assumed for the nebular line regions is the @xcite curve , with color excesses based on those found for the stellar continuum ( also assuming a @xcite curve ) . in our analysis",
    ", we calculated sfr(h@xmath3 ) assuming the @xcite galactic extinction curve , as was the original intent of @xcite , but we explore the effect of assuming other attenuation curves in deriving the color excess , as well as the implications for dust corrections and bolometric sfrs , in sections  [ sec : gasvsstars ] and [ sec : sfrimplications ] below . throughout the paper , and unless noted otherwise , the specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) are computed assuming the dust - corrected sfrs(h@xmath3 ) and the sed - determined stellar masses .",
    "this approach is more advantageous than combining sed - determined sfrs with @xmath5 as these quantities are highly correlated with each other ( i.e. , both sfr(sed ) and @xmath5 are constrained by the normalization of the best - fit sed model with the photometry ) .",
    "as noted above , the distribution of h@xmath3/h@xmath4 ratios implies the presence of dust in the majority of the objects in our sample . before considering the level of obscuration required to reproduce the observed balmer decrements  a step that requires the assumption of an attenuation curve  it is instructive to examine how the galaxy spectral shapes vary with h@xmath3/h@xmath4 ratio .",
    "we focus specifically on the sensitivity of the uv spectral slope to dust obscuration , given the large absorption cross - section of dust to uv photons , and the prevalent use of the uv slope as a dust indicator for typical star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "formally , the uv slope @xmath4 is defined such that @xmath106 .",
    "note that @xmath4 is the _ observed _ uv continuum slope , irrespective of the underlying stellar population .",
    "thus , a galaxy with an older stellar population and a significant contribution of uv flux from stars of spectral type a and later , can exhibit the same spectral slope as a galaxy whose uv continuum is dominated by ob stars and contains significant amounts of dust .      in practice",
    ", @xmath4 can be measured directly from a high signal - to - noise spectrum using a number of continuum windows spanning the range @xmath107 , where the windows are designed to exclude regions of strong interstellar / stellar absorption and the @xmath11 dust absorption feature @xcite . for most galaxies lacking rest - uv spectroscopic data , as in our case , either broad- and intermediate - band photometry , or the stellar population model that best fits such photometry , can be used to estimate @xmath4 .",
    "we calculated a `` photometric '' uv slope ( @xmath108 ) by fitting directly the photometry ( taking into account the photometric errors ) , which includes for all objects in our sample anywhere from 4 to 19 photometric points that lie in the ( rest - frame ) range @xmath109 . the measurement uncertainty in the rest - uv photometry results in best - fit uv slopes with a typical error of @xmath110    for comparison",
    ", we also computed an `` sed '' uv slope ( @xmath111 ) by fitting the flux of the best - fit stellar population model as a function of wavelength , using only those flux points that lie within the 10 continuum windows given in @xcite . the typical formal uncertainty in @xmath112",
    ", when using the 10 aforementioned windows , is @xmath113 ( not including the systematic error associated with the assumed stellar population model ) .",
    "the two measures of uv slope , @xmath108 and @xmath112 , are highly correlated because the stellar population model is fit to the same photometry used to calculate @xmath108 .",
    "our expectation is that if the uv slope is sensitive to dust obscuration , which a number of studies have shown to be the case for different subsets of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then we should observe a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath92 .",
    "the scatter between these two quantities may hint at other factors that influence @xmath4 , including star - formation history , metallicity of the underlying stellar population , and differences in the geometrical distribution of stars and dust in galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta_vs_taub]a shows the distribution of @xmath114 with @xmath92 for the 182 objects in our sample with @xmath115 .",
    "the average h@xmath3/h@xmath4 ratio for the 42 h@xmath4-undetected galaxies , as calculated from the composite spectrum ( see above ) , is @xmath116 , corresponding to @xmath117 . the average value of the _ individual _ @xmath114 measurements for these 42 galaxies is @xmath118 .",
    "these average values for the h@xmath4-undetected galaxies are indicated by the star in figure  [ fig : beta_vs_taub]a .",
    "generally , there is a large dispersion in @xmath108 at a given balmer optical depth . in the limit where @xmath119",
    ", @xmath4 varies from the bluest ( @xmath120 ) to reddest ( @xmath121 ) values observed .",
    "as noted above , @xmath4 can be sensitive to factors other than the dust content , possibly accounting for some of the scatter in uv slope at a given balmer optical depth .",
    "these factors are discussed in detail below .        galaxies with significant older stellar populations can exhibit uv slopes that are redder than those predicted from dust attenuation alone .",
    "specifically , a stars from previous generations of star formation can contribute significantly to the near - uv flux if the current sfr  and hence the contribution from o and b stars  is low , as might be the case for galaxies with low specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) .",
    "the two consequences of this effect are to increase the scatter in @xmath4 at a fixed @xmath92 , and to accentuate the trend in @xmath4 vs. @xmath92 if dustier galaxies are on average older and more massive . for the moment",
    ", we consider the effect of star - formation history ( i.e. , effect of older stellar populations ) on @xmath4 by color - coding the points in figure  [ fig : beta_vs_taub ] by ssfr .",
    "it is apparent that there is a `` sequence '' in the location of galaxies in the @xmath108-@xmath92 plane with ssfr , such that the locus of points shifts towards redder @xmath108 at a fixed @xmath92 with _ decreasing _ ssfr .",
    "this is the expected behavior if late - type stars increasingly affect the near - uv flux with decreasing ssfr .",
    "the shifting of the locus is also ( unsurprisingly ) apparent if we differentiate the points again by ssfr , but use @xmath112 instead of @xmath108 ( figure  [ fig : beta_vs_taub ] ) .    to demonstrate quantitatively the shifting of the @xmath4 vs. @xmath92 relation with ssfr , we executed two tests . in the first",
    ", we used k - s statistical tests to determine the probability that two distributions of @xmath4 at two given ssfrs ( and at a fixed @xmath92 ) are drawn from the same parent distribution . in practice , we gridded the data in three bins of @xmath92 ( @xmath92=0 , 0.0 - 0.3 , and 0.3 - 1.0 ) , and two bins of @xmath122 , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the ssfr bin boundaries were chosen to encompass most of the objects in our sample , with an equal number of objects per ssfr bin .",
    "we then performed two - sided k - s tests on the two distributions of @xmath4 ( for the two ssfr bins ) in each bin of @xmath92 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : kstwo ] , and they suggest that the @xmath4 distributions between the two ssfr bins are drawn from different parent populations .",

    "table  [ tab : linfit ] summarizes the results for @xmath112 vs. @xmath92 and @xmath108 vs. @xmath92 .",
    "significant correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath92 are found in most cases , with the slopes and intercepts from linear regressions indicated in table  [ tab : linfit ] .",
    "we also estimated the intrinsic dispersion in the data ( @xmath125 ) by assuming that the total dispersion in @xmath4 vs. @xmath92 is the quadrature sum of @xmath125 and the measurement error , @xmath126 .",
    "clearly , @xmath125 will depend on the adopted bin widths , but our goal was to determine the degree to which the @xmath127 correlations in given ssfr bins overlap when considering the intrinsic scatter in the data .",
    "the fits obtained for @xmath112 vs. @xmath92 are shown in figure  [ fig : linfit ] . from these statistical tests ,",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , we put forth a physical interpretation that is consistent with the trends and scatter between @xmath4 and @xmath92 .      given evidence that neither an older stellar population nor a change in metallicity is responsible for the reddening of @xmath4 with increasing @xmath92 , we are left with the possibility that dust attenuation is the dominant factor in the observed trend between @xmath4 and @xmath92 . a similar line of reasoning is presented in @xcite to account for the correlation between uv slope and balmer optical depth for a sample of 39 local starburst and blue compact galaxies from @xcite , where the local trend is shown in figure  [ fig : linfit ] .",

    "we adopt a procedure similar to that presented in @xcite , generalized from that of @xcite , to derive the selective attenuation curve .",
    "the premise behind this procedure is that because the uv spectral index is sensitive primarily to dust attenuation , the ratio of the average spectrum of galaxies with high balmer optical depths to that of galaxies with low optical depths should reflect the average effect of attenuation on the stellar seds . of course",
    ", especially in the optical and near - ir , there can be a wide range of intrinsic sed shapes for star - forming galaxies depending on their star - formation histories and ages .",
    "however , to first order , galaxies of a given ssfr will have comparably - shaped intrinsic stellar seds , as the flux at any given wavelength is contributed to in a similar proportion by the current star formation and the light from previous generations of star formation .",
    "the exact form of how the previous stellar mass was built up ( i.e. , the star - formation history ) is unimportant , as the rest - frame optical to near - ir light that is used to infer stellar masses ( and hence ssfrs ) arises from some combination of the _ currently _ forming stellar population , and from lower mass ( spectral type f5 and later ) stars that have not yet evolved off the main sequence for the age of the universe at @xmath0 .. some circumstantial evidence for an un - evolving imf at @xmath170 comes from the general agreement between the integral of the cosmic sfr density and the evolution of the stellar mass density @xcite . ] for instance , figure  [ fig : conformity ] shows the conformity of the stellar sed for a galaxy with an sfr and @xmath5 ( and hence , ssfr ) typical of the average galaxy in our sample , irrespective of the star - formation history .",

    "the objects within each ssfr bin were further divided into three bins of @xmath92 . for ssfr bin 1 ,",
    "the first @xmath92 bin includes all objects with @xmath99 , and the remaining objects are split roughly equally into two additional bins .",
    "given the low number of objects ( 8) that have @xmath99 in ssfr bin 2 , for this ssfr bin we divided the objects equally into three bins of @xmath92 .",
    "the derivation of the attenuation curve relies on the assumption that the _ average _ intrinsic sed ( and hence the ssfr ) is unchanging as a function of balmer optical depth , irrespective of the exact mix of different star - formation histories that may be contributing to that average sed .",

    "the ratios of the uncorrected to corrected @xmath231 at @xmath264 and @xmath265@xmath20 m are 1.083 and 0.998 , respectively , for ssfr bin 1 ; and 0.992 and 1.056 , respectively , for ssfr bin 2 . given the less than @xmath266 differences implied for the total attenuation curve , we assume the uncorrected version expressed in equation  [ eq : kstars ] .    finally , we note that systematic offsets in the derived stellar masses or sfr(h@xmath3 ) resulting from the assumption of different attenuation curves in the sed fitting will simply shift all the galaxies up or down in terms of ssfr , but the _ ordering _ of the galaxies will for the most part be preserved . and @xmath193 in a given ssfr bin ( figure  [ fig : selq ] ) , and the similarly in shape of @xmath267 between the two ssfr bins ( figure  [ fig : fqeff ] ) . ] for this reason , the ratios of the intrinsic seds shown in figure  [ fig : intrinsicseds ] will be unaffected by assuming a different attenuation curve in the derivation of sfr(h@xmath3 ) and @xmath5 .",

    "the smc , lmc , and milky way curves , and their respective normalizations , are taken from @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these curves is that they all asymptote to zero as the dust absorption cross - section becomes negligible at long wavelengths , with a corresponding rapid rise in the attenuation curve toward shorter ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "the one distinguishing feature of the milky way and lmc extinction curves , namely the @xmath11 `` bump '' @xcite , is absent from the attenuation curve found for local uv starburst galaxies @xcite , but its presence to varying degrees has been noted in higher - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to ascertain the existence of this excess absorption , we examined the average photometry of galaxies in bins of @xmath92 and @xmath96 , where the latter were determined from the sed modeling discussed in section  [ sec : sedmod ] . to improve the rest - frame wavelength sampling of the average photometry",

    "we then calculated the average , and error in the average , flux densities in rest - frame wavelength bins of @xmath152(e.g .",
    ", similar to the method used above to compare the average photometry of galaxies in our sample to the functional fit to the photometry ; figure  [ fig : aveseds ] ) .",
    "a linear function was fit to the log of the average flux density as a function of @xmath268 in two wavelength ranges bracketing the @xmath11 feature : @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",

    "the average flux densities throughout the wavelength range from @xmath271 to @xmath272 were then divided by this linear function to produce the normalized points shown in figure  [ fig : bump ] .",
    "there is on average a lower flux at wavelengths corresponding to roughly where the excess absorption would be expected .. this small bias does not affect our conclusions regarding the contribution of a stars to the near - uv continuum ( section  [ sec : astars ] ) , though of course fitting the slope without the photometry that may be affected by the @xmath11 absorption will result in larger random uncertainties . ] while the depth of the absorption appears to be insensitive to @xmath92 , there is some marginal significance for a trend between the absorption depth and the color excess of the stellar continuum .",
    "a spearman correlation test implies that that the null hypothesis of no correlation between the depth of the @xmath11 and the color excess of the stellar continuum can be ruled out at the @xmath273@xmath76 level .",
    "we caution that the excess absorption will be smoothed by the finite wavelength sampling of the average photometry as well as the fact that the average photometry is computed from broad- and intermediate - band magnitudes .    for comparison , @xcite deduce the shape of the dust attenuation curve for a sample of 751 galaxies at @xmath274 , and find evidence for excess absorption at 2175 for roughly @xmath275 of their sample , almost all ( @xmath276 ) of which lie at @xmath277 .",
    "they also find that the rate of a secure detection of bump increases by a factor of @xmath278 when considering the dustier galaxies ( i.e. , those directly detected at mid- and far - ir wavelengths ) . in another recent study ,",
    "@xcite examine a sample of somewhat lower - redshift ( @xmath279 ) galaxies and find that the strength of the @xmath11 absorption correlates with the `` steepness '' ( i.e. , the wavelength dependence ) of the attenuation curve .",

    "regardless , our analysis shows that the attenuation curve for the mosdef galaxies exhibits a slope that is identical to that of the @xcite attenuation curve for @xmath282@xmath20 m , but with a lower normalization ( @xmath8 ) . for @xmath283@xmath20",
    "m , the mosdef curve is similar to that of the smc curve , and more generally the two are essentially identical for @xmath284@xmath20 m .",
    "recent studies have suggested that some populations of high - redshift galaxies have reddening consistent with the smc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here , we have shown that through direct measurements of the attenuation curve , an smc - like behavior at longer wavelengths ( @xmath285 ) may be more generally applicable at high redshift .",
    "a comparison between physical models of the distribution of dust and stars in galaxies and the attenuation curve will be presented elsewhere , but we note that the shape of the attenuation curve may imply a larger covering fraction of dust in the rest - optical , or a different dust grain size distribution , than would be indicated by the @xcite curve .",
    "the implications for these differences in the shapes of the attenuation curves are discussed in the next section .",
    "given the apparent differences in the attenuation curve derived in this work relative to the curve typically assumed for high - redshift galaxies ( i.e. , @xcite ) , we adopted our new calculation of the attenuation curve to refit the stellar populations of galaxies in our sample , in the same way as described in section  [ sec : sedmod ] .",
    "the comparison of several stellar population parameters using our new curve versus those obtained with the @xcite and smc curves is shown in figure  [ fig : sedcompare ] .",
    "the mean color excess of the stellar continuum assuming the mosdef attenuation curve is @xmath286 redder than that obtained with the @xcite relation ( @xmath287 vs. @xmath288 ) . combining this average difference in the color excesses with the @xmath289 difference in the two attenuation curves at @xmath290 we infer dust obscuration factors ( required to de - redden the observed uv sfrs ) that are @xmath291 times smaller than those inferred from the @xcite relation . as a result ,",
    "the average sed - inferred sfrs obtained with the mosdef attenuation curve are @xmath9 smaller than those obtained with a @xcite curve .",
    "this systematic difference in the sfrs is typically smaller than the random uncertainties , where the latter were computed using monte carlo realizations of the observed photometry and refitting the model seds to the perturbed photometry ; section  [ sec : sedmod ] ) .",
    "similarly , the systematic offset seen here is well within the typical factor of @xmath278 uncertainty in independent measurements of the sfrs based on combining uv and ir data for galaxies with similar sfrs and stellar masses , and at the same redshifts , as those considered here @xcite .",
    "these results apply on average , as it is clear from figure  [ fig : sedcompare ] that the difference in @xmath96 implied by the two attenuation curves is a function of the `` redness '' of the object . for the bluest galaxies ,",
    "we find @xmath292 ( these are galaxies for which little reddening is required to reproduce the uv colors ) . for the reddest galaxies ( e.g. , those with @xmath293 as computed from the mosdef attenuation curve ) , we find @xmath294 .    assuming the mosdef attenuation curve results in galaxies that are on average @xmath295myr older relative to the ages derived using the @xcite curve , but we view these differences to be negligible given the large uncertainties in the ages .",
    "older with the mosdef attenuation curve relative to those obtained with the @xcite curve .",
    "these are objects where the mosdef and @xcite `` best - fit '' seds are essentially identical in the rest - frame optical , but where the former are generally fainter in the rest - frame near - ir . as such , the implied balmer/4000 breaks are stronger for the mosdef `` best - fit '' seds resulting in older ages . ]",
    "note that the `` uncertainties '' quoted here do not account for other systematic effects , including differences in the assumed star - formation histories of galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that assuming the mosdef attenuation curve yields better fits to the longer wavelength ( i.e. , rest - frame @xmath296@xmath20 m ) photometry than the @xcite curve for rising star - formation histories ( figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) . as such ,",
    "the stellar masses are @xmath297 lower when we adopt the mosdef attenuation curve in lieu of the @xcite curve .",
    "this implies an @xmath298dex difference in @xmath299 that is of the same order as the uncertainty in stellar mass implied by the photometric errors .",
    "similarly , in comparison to the results derived with an smc attenuation curve , those assuming the mosdef curve imply significantly redder e(b - v ) ( @xmath300 ) , younger ages ( by a factor of @xmath278 ) , higher sfrs ( by a factor of @xmath278 ) , and lower stellar masses ( @xmath301dex ) .",
    "the differences stem from the fact that the smc curve has a steeper wavelength dependence in the uv than either the mosdef or @xcite attenuation curves , and thus a lower amount of reddening is required to fit a given uv color . as a result ,",
    "the sfrs are lower with the smc curve .",
    "further , the near - ir - optical color is attributed more to an older stellar population than dust reddening , resulting in older ages and larger stellar masses .",
    "another point of consideration is how the ssfrs are affected by different assumptions of the attenuation curve .",
    "recall that the ssfrs were calculated by combining h@xmath3-based sfrs , which were determined independently of sed fitting , with the sed - based stellar masses ( section  [ sec : sedmod ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath3-based sfrs were derived assuming the @xcite extinction curve ( section  [ sec : sfrcalc ] ) .",
    "the sed - based stellar masses were computed assuming the @xcite curve .",
    "we will return to a more detailed discussion of the implications of our results for sfr determinations ( section  [ sec : sfrimplications ] ) , but for the remainder of our analysis , we adopt the ssfrs computed assuming the stellar masses obtained with the mosdef attenuation curve , and sfr(h@xmath3 ) obtained with the @xcite extinction curve . as shown in figure  [ fig : ssfrcompare ] , the new ssfrs computed in this way are quite similar to those computed when we assume the @xcite attenuation curve in deriving the stellar masses , with the former being @xmath302dex smaller than the latter . because there is only a systematic offset between the two ssfr determinations , and the relative ordering of the galaxies is preserved , the ssfr bins used to calculate the attenuation curve ( section  [ sec : attder ] ) will include essentially the same set of galaxies regardless of which attenuation curve is assumed ( and , in any case , the results of section  [ sec : attder ] suggest that because the attenuation curves computed from the two ssfr bins are very similar , we could have simply ignored any binning with ssfr in computing the curve ) .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : astars ] , @xmath143 is not substantially bluer than @xmath303 , suggesting that a stars do not contribute significantly to the uv continuum for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider this point further , because an intrinsically blue spectral slope in the range @xmath304 can appear redder than the slope measured over the wider baseline in wavelength ( @xmath305 ) if the attenuation curve is rising steeply in the uv .",
    "therefore , we must rule out the case where the attenuation curve masks the contribution from a stars to the near - uv continuum .",
    "our new derivation of the attenuation curve implies that the difference between @xmath138 and @xmath141 for galaxies where the latter is @xmath306 ( a limit that encompasses almost all of the galaxies in our sample ) , is @xmath307 for @xmath308 .",
    "this difference in uv slope is small compared to both the typical measurement errors in the uv slopes and the dispersion in @xmath138 at a given @xmath141 ( figure  [ fig : betabluecompare ] ) .",
    "thus , the reddening implied by the mosdef attenuation curve is insufficient to make an intrinsically blue @xmath138 appear substantially redder than @xmath141 , and our conclusion regarding the contribution of a stars to the uv continuum still holds .",
    "the test just discussed allows us to calculate the useful relationship between @xmath4 and the color excess of the stellar continuum assuming the mosdef attenuation curve and an underlying solar metallicity stellar population with constant star formation for at least @xmath152myr ( i.e. , with an intrinsic spectral slope of @xmath309 ) : @xmath310 .",
    "additionally , equations  [ eq : kdef ] and [ eq : kstars ] imply that the attenuation in magnitudes at @xmath311 is related to the color excess by @xmath312 .",
    "thus , combining the previous two equations , we find @xmath313 again for an intrinsic spectral slope @xmath314 . for comparison ,",
    "the relation from @xcite is @xmath315 , or @xmath316 when shifted to account for the difference in the intrinsic uv slope ( @xmath317 ) between @xcite and the present study ( i.e. , @xmath318 vs @xmath319 ) .",
    "consequently , for the bulk of the galaxies in our sample with @xmath320 , the implied difference in the magnitudes of extinction at @xmath311 , when assuming the mosdef and @xcite attenuation curves , is @xmath321 .",
    "more specifically , the mosdef attenuation curve implies dust obscuration factors , @xmath322[0.4@xmath323(1600 ) ] , that are a factor of @xmath324 times lower than those implied by the @xcite ( or @xcite ) attenuation curve , with an average correction that results in sfrs that are @xmath9 lower for the mosdef curve , as noted above .",
    "equation  [ eq : magext ] can be used to directly determine the attenuation of the uv continuum for galaxies of a given ( measured ) uv slope . however , as we discuss in section  [ sec : sfrimplications ] , additional factors may be required to recover total sfrs from uv - based ones .",
    "there has been a considerable effort to investigate the relationship beteween the attenuation of the stellar continuum and ionized gas in high - redshift galaxies , particularly in light of local observations of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) that suggest a higher reddening of the ionized gas than of the stellar continuum : e.g. , @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "note that this often - quoted relationship describes the color excess of the stellar continuum and the nebular line - emitting regions , not the total attenuation .",
    "more precisely , this relation is derived under the assumption that the starburst attenuation curve applies to the stellar continuum , and a galactic extinction curve @xcite to the ionized gas @xcite . however",
    ", most investigations of the stellar and nebular reddening in high - redshift galaxies have assumed that the same attenuation curve applies for both the gas and the stars , and it is unclear if this is an appropriate assumption in the context of high - redshift galaxies .    from the standpoint of local galaxies ,",
    "the difference in attenuation curves can be understood in the framework where the recombination emission arises from spatially compact hii regions that are subject to a high covering fraction of dust and where a line - of - sight extinction curve ( e.g. , @xcite or smc ) is more appropriate , versus the more spatially extended stellar continuum that has a lower dust covering fraction and is subject to a `` greyer '' attenuation curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this configuration is similar to the two component dust model of @xcite where the hii regions are attenuated by a component of dust in undissipated parent birth clouds , with a second diffuse component of dust in the ism .",
    "studies of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath0 have shown a general agreement between uv and h@xmath3-based sfrs when applying the same color excess and assuming the same attenuation curve applies for both the stars and gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for results at @xmath326 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "studies that have targeted on average more highly star - forming or more massive galaxies , and/or photometrically - selected galaxies , indicate a higher attenuation of the gas versus the stellar continuum , again with most studies assuming that the same attenuation curve applies for both the stars and gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a plausible scenario that can resolve the current observations is one in which the difference in the continuum and nebular attenuation is a function of sfr , mass , or ssfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as remarked in section  [ sec : nebvsstel ] , the selective attenuation curve derived in this study implies that _ on average _ the ionized gas suffers greater extinction than the continuum ( at the wavelengths of h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 ) .",
    "we scrutinized this result by comparing the color excesses of the stellar continuum derived from sed fitting , with those of the ionized gas , computed as : @xmath327 in the last step , we have assumed that the @xcite extinction curve applies to the hii regions . adopting the @xcite and mosdef attenuation curves results in @xmath328 values that are a factor of @xmath329 and @xmath330 those assuming the @xcite curve , respectively . there is a large scatter in the relationship between the gas and continuum color excesses , with @xmath331 of the objects having equal gas and continuum color excesses within the ( @xmath60@xmath76 ) uncertainties , and only @xmath332 consistent with having @xmath333 . as could have been anticipated from figures  [ fig : beta_vs_taub ] and [ fig : linfit ]",
    ", the degree to which @xmath328 diverges from @xmath334 is dependent upon the ssfr of the galaxy , with the largest differences for galaxies with the largest ssfrs ( figure  [ fig : ebmvcompare ] ) .",
    ", a _ different _ relation is found between @xmath335 and ssfr(sed ) , i.e. , the ssfr computed when we use _ sed - based _ sfrs . ]",
    "we should consider , however , whether selection biases could result in correlation between the difference in the gas and nebular color excesses and the ssfr . in particular ,",
    "if galaxies with h@xmath3 fluxes close to our detection limit of @xmath336ergs@xmath14@xmath337 are dusty , then their h@xmath4 lines may be undetected with a greater frequency than galaxies of the same dust content but with bright h@xmath3 lines .",
    "as a result , we may be insensitive to galaxies with low sfrs and high nebular color excesses .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ fig : bd_vs_lha ] , the h@xmath4-undetected galaxies in our sample have limits that span the full range of observed @xmath338 .",
    "further , if we compute the average sfr(h@xmath3 ) , ssfr , @xmath328 , and @xmath334 for the h@xmath4-undetected galaxies , as shown in figures  [ fig : ebmvcompare ] and [ fig : ebmvcompare_sfr ] ( where the averages for the sfr and @xmath328 are determined from the composite stack of their spectra ; section  [ sec : sample ] ) , the aforementioned quantities suggest that there is not a large population of dusty galaxies with low sfrs and low ssfrs . aside from this direct observation",
    ", it has been shown in several studies that the mean obscuration of high - redshift galaxies increases with sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also discussion below ) , suggesting that among galaxies with low h@xmath3 fluxes , those that are intrinsically less dusty vastly outnumber those with high dust content .",
    "the stacking of mid- to far - ir data for the mosdef galaxies will help to clarify these arguments .",
    "there is no similar bias in terms of @xmath339 , as the spectroscopically confirmed mosdef galaxies have rest - uv colors similar to those of galaxies in the parent sample @xcite .    formally , a kendall s @xmath340 test indicates a probability of @xmath341 that the difference between gas and stellar color excesses is _ uncorrelated _ with ssfr .",
    "the correlation with h@xmath3-based sfr is even stronger , with @xmath342 probability that @xmath335 is uncorrelated with sfr ( figure  [ fig : ebmvcompare_sfr ] ) .",
    "similarly , there is a @xmath343 probability that the difference in color excesses is uncorrelated with stellar mass .",
    "thus , the conflicting results on the relationship between the color excesses of the hii regions and stellar continuum in high - redshift galaxies can be reconciled if selection over different ranges of sfr and/or stellar mass leads to the inclusion of more or fewer galaxies with the largest discrepancies between nebular and continuum color excess .",
    "specifically , galaxies with sfrs@xmath12@xmath13yr@xmath14 exhibit nebular color excesses that are substantially redder than the continuum color excesses .",
    "in contrast , over the range of sfrs characteristic of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath0 ( @xmath344@xmath13yr@xmath14 for a chabrier imf ; e.g. , @xcite ) , the nebular color excesses are essentially equivalent to or bluer than those of the stellar continuum . of the 51 objects that have @xmath328 that is more than @xmath60@xmath76 bluer than @xmath339 , 35 ( or @xmath345 ) formally have @xmath346 .",
    "these galaxies are unlikely to have hii regions that are completely dust - free given the reasoning presented in section  [ sec : betavstauscatter ] , and their @xmath339 span the full range observed for galaxies in our sample in general .",
    "an analysis of the spatially - resolved colors of these galaxies should lend more insight into the question of why they exhibit @xmath328 that are bluer than the color excess of the stellar continuum . in summary , we find that the difference in the color excesses of the stellar continuum and ionized gas in high - redshift galaxies is a strong function of sfr : above an sfr of @xmath15@xmath13yr@xmath14 , the nebular lines become increasingly reddened relative to the color excess of the stellar continuum .",
    "so far , our discussion has focused on a comparison of the _ color excesses _ of the ionized gas and the stellar continuum in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "recall that the color excess of the ionized gas was computed assuming the @xcite extinction curve .",
    "the color excess of the stellar continuum was derived assuming the mosdef attenuation curve .",
    "these respective curves were used to also compute the total attenuation in magnitudes of the line and continuum emission at 6565 : @xmath347 the comparison of @xmath348 and @xmath349 ( figure  [ fig : compatt ] ) confirms the result noted in section  [ sec : nebvsstel ] , namely that the ionized gas is on average more obscured than the stellar continuum . specifically , we find that the average difference in the magnitudes of attenuation between recombination line and continuum photons at @xmath350 is @xmath351 .",
    "however , as was the case in the comparison of the color excesses , we find that the difference in total attenuation of line and continuum photons depends on the sfr , such that galaxies with the largest sfrs can exhibit line - emitting regions that are half a magnitude ( or more ) attenuated than the stellar continuum .",
    "a final point of consideration is the strong dependence of total dust attenuation on sfr ( figure  [ fig : sfrvsdust ] ) .",
    "such a correlation has been noted before both at low @xcite and high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and has also been shown to evolve with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "physically , this trend can be understood as the product of increased metal and dust enrichment of the ism with increasing sfr . in the context of the present study , a _",
    "possible _ simple model that can account for the trends in ionized gas versus continuum attenuation is one in which a modestly reddened stellar population dominates the observed uv through optical continuum emission of galaxies over the entire range of sfrs considered here .",
    "meanwhile , as the total sfr rises , a greater fraction of this sfr is obscured in optically - thick regions , as a consequence of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies galaxies with larger sfrs . as a result ,",
    "the _ average _ optical depth towards ionizing stars rises with sfr .",
    "this simple picture is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon_crop ] .",
    "we emphasize that this is an `` average '' effect , as it is clear that some fraction of o stars are in relatively unobscured regions of the galaxies where they can contribute significantly to the uv continuum and where the average reddening ( as measured by the uv slope , @xmath4 ) is lower than that measured from the balmer lines .",
    "the framework just discussed is somewhat different than the one originally invoked to explain the disparity between the gas and continuum color excesses in the local universe .",
    "locally , such a discrepancy between color excesses is thought to arise from the increased dust covering fraction surrounding hii regions ( e.g. , perhaps due to undissipated parent birth clouds surrounding the youngest stars ; @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case at high redshift , i.e. , that _ most _ of the short - lived o stars reside in or close to their parent molecular clouds , then we should see a _",
    "systematic _ offset between gas and continuum color excesses at all sfrs .",
    "however , this expected systematic offset is not seen in our data ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : ebmvcompare ] , [ fig : ebmvcompare_sfr ] and [ fig : compatt ] ) . rather , our results suggest two distinct stellar populations in each galaxy : one in which stars of all masses are subject to modest amounts of dust reddening and which dominate the observed uv through optical continuum luminosity ; and another in which stars of all masses reside in very dusty regions .",
    "the second population becomes more dominant over the first population ( in terms of its contribution to the nebular line and bolometric luminosities ) as the total sfr of a galaxy increases .",
    "consequently , the color excesses ( and total attenuation ) of the gas and continuum diverge with rising sfr .",
    "this simple picture may also imply that the attenuation curve relevant for the ionized gas may transition from a gray curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) to a progressively `` steeper '' ( e.g. , galactic or smc ) curve with increasing sfr .    along these lines ,",
    "more recent high spatial resolution observations of several nearby galaxies suggest that the relationship between the attenuation of the gas and stars varies with sfr surface density ( @xmath352 ) , such that the balmer lines are systematically more attenuated than the stellar continuum for regions where @xmath353@xmath13yr@xmath14kpc@xmath354 ( e.g. , see figure  4 of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have been interpreted as evidence that the balmer lines are dominated by dust - buried hii regions at high @xmath352 @xcite .",
    "if the higher sfr galaxies in our sample also have higher @xmath352 , then the situation inferred locally on small scales ( e.g. , 100 - 200pc ) may also apply at high redshift .",
    "this issue can be addressed with the larger mosdef sample , which will include galaxy size information .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that while the wavelength dependence of the dust obscuration appears to be independent of specific sfr , the _ total _ obscuration of the ionized gas relative to that of the stellar continuum varies with sfr and ssfr .",
    "specifically , galaxies with larger sfrs ( and ssfrs ) exhibit redder color excesses and larger total attenuations for the line emission relative to those for the continuum .",
    "these trends are responsible for the scatter seen between @xmath4 and @xmath92 ( figure  [ fig : beta_vs_taub ] ) .",
    "the physical picture discussed here implies that galaxies with larger sfrs may exhibit a higher dispersion in their spatially resolved colors as the dust obscuration becomes more patchy with the rise of a second ( dustier ) population .",
    "alternatively , the increased dust covering fraction expected for galaxies with larger sfrs may be reflective of a compact configuration of the star formation .",
    "hence , future prospects for elaborating on this simple picture will include a detailed analysis of how the sfr surface density , and the spatially resolved uv colors of galaxies  whose measurement is aided with deep high - resolution _ hst _ imaging in the fields targeted with mosdef  correlate with globally - measured color excesses of the ionized gas and the stellar continuum .        as mentioned in section  [ sec : sedcompare ] , the sed - based sfrs assuming a mosdef attenuation curve are on average lower ( by @xmath355 ) than those determined with the @xcite curve .",
    "the h@xmath3-based sfrs also rely on an assumption of the attenuation curve , both in deriving the color excess of the ionized gas , and in applying the total dust correction to recover the intrinsic h@xmath3 sfrs .",
    "the default values of sfr(h@xmath3 ) were computed assuming the @xcite extinction curve i.e .",
    ", this curve was used to calculate @xmath328 given the balmer decrement , and the value of the curve at @xmath350 was used to dust correct the observed h@xmath3 luminosity ( section  [ sec : sfrcalc ] ) .",
    "the more common practice of assuming that the @xcite curve applies to high - redshift hii regions results in sfrs that can be as much as @xmath331 larger than those assuming the @xcite extinction curve ( figure  [ fig : sfrhacompare ] ) , with an average offset of @xmath9 .",
    "this comparison underscores the importance of considering the appropriate attenuation curve to use when dust correcting the line and continuum emission in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "when compared against each other , the h@xmath3 and sed - determined sfrs show a general agreement , with a scatter of @xmath356dex ( figure  [ fig : hasedcompare ] ) .",
    "a similar agreement has been noted in @xcite , who also compare h@xmath3 and sed - based sfrs , but who use a different prescription for estimating the color excess relevant for the nebular emission as they did not have balmer decrement measurements for their sample . notwithstanding this _ general _ agreement , the fraction of objects for which the h@xmath3-based sfr exceeds the uv- ( or sed- ) based sfr by more than @xmath60@xmath76 increases from @xmath357 to @xmath358 from sfr(h@xmath3)@xmath359@xmath13yr@xmath14 to @xmath360@xmath13yr@xmath14 .",
    "we formalized this trend by fitting a third - order polynomial to sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) versus @xmath361 $ ] : @xmath362 figure  [ fig : hasedcompare ] shows that @xmath363 of galaxies with sfr(h@xmath3)@xmath12@xmath13yr@xmath14 have uv- and sed - based sfrs that underpredict the h@xmath3-based sfr by an average factor of @xmath364 .",
    "it is unlikely that this trend is due to selection effects , as the mosdef galaxy selection is based primarily on rest - optical continuum emission , and the success of identifying a redshift depends only on whether any of the rest - optical emission lines are detected , independent of the uv continuum .",
    "thus , it is improbable that we are missing a large number of galaxies where the uv - based sfr is substantially smaller than the h@xmath3-based sfrs for sfr(h@xmath3)@xmath344@xmath13yr@xmath14 .    focusing on those galaxies with lower sfrs",
    ", we find that their sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) ratios lie systematically below a value of unity .",
    "we must address whether this systematic difference is due to variations in the dust attenuation of the nebular regions and stellar continuum , or if there is some other mechanism that may be partly responsible for the low sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) ratios for these galaxies . to investigate this ,",
    "we calculated the ratio of the _ observed _ h@xmath3 and uv sfrs ( i.e. , uncorrected for dust extinction ) for all the objects in our sample ( figure  [ fig : obssfr ] ) .",
    "the observed sfrs will include the light emitted by unobscured stars , as well as the unattenuated light from obscured stars .",
    "galaxies with ( dust corrected ) sfr(h@xmath3)@xmath365@xmath13yr@xmath14 have observed sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) ratios that are generally within @xmath75@xmath76 of a ratio of unity . as a consequence , for the stars contributing to the observed h@xmath3 and uv luminosities , there is no evidence that we are observing these them several tens of myr after an initial burst of star formation : this scenario would result in observed sfr ratios that deviate from unity due to the different timescales ( and mass ranges ) over which the h@xmath3 and uv luminosities are sensitive to the total sfr .",
    "thus , if the stars dominating the unobscured h@xmath3 and uv luminosities have a similar imf and star - formation history as those stars that dominate the obscured h@xmath3 and uv luminosities , then the results of figure  [ fig : obssfr ] suggest that the low dust - corrected sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) ratios measured for galaxies with sfr(h@xmath3)@xmath366@xmath13yr@xmath14 are likely tied to differences in the dust obscuration of the nebular emission and stellar continuum , rather than differences in star - formation history , changes in the imf , or sampling stochasticity ( c.f . , @xcite ) .      with our independent measurements of the color excesses of the stellar continuum and ionized gas",
    ", we can quantify the relationship between sed - inferred quantities ( i.e. , @xmath339 and sfr(sed ) ) which are commonly available for high - redshift galaxy samples , and @xmath328 , which can be difficult to constrain in the absence of balmer decrement measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : prescription ] shows the difference between gas and continuum color excess ( @xmath367 ) , and the difference between the attenuation of recombination and continuum photons ( @xmath368 ) , as a function of the sed - determined ssfr , ssfr(sed ) .",
    "note that ssfr(sed ) combines the sed - determined sfr with the sed - determined stellar mass , so it is not the same as the default ssfr assumed throughout the paper ( i.e. , the latter combines sfr(h@xmath3 ) with @xmath5 ) .",
    "we chose to quantify these relationships in terms of ssfr , and not sfr , as the correlations of @xmath335 and @xmath369 with ssfr(sed ) are stronger than those with sfr(sed ) . to establish useful empirical relations between these quantities",
    ", we fit them with functions of @xmath370 + 10)$ ] : @xmath371 and @xmath372 the scatter in these relations are @xmath373 \\approx 0.12 $ ] and @xmath374 \\approx 0.24 $ ] . given @xmath339 and ssfr(sed ) obtained from standard sed - fitting",
    ", one can use equations  [ eq : ebmvprescrip ] and [ eq : attprescrip ] to then _ roughly _ estimate @xmath328 and @xmath348 , keeping in mind the large scatter in these quantities .",
    "finally , note that the difference in color excesses is found to _ decrease _ on average with increasing ssfr(sed ) ( e.g. , see also @xcite ) , _ opposite _ of the trend that we found between @xmath367 and the default ssfrs that assume h@xmath3-based sfrs ( figures  [ fig : ebmvcompare ] and [ fig : compatt ] ) .",
    "this behavior simply reflects the systematic difference between sed - based and h@xmath3-based sfrs , as discussed above .",
    "the physical picture put forth in the previous section leads to the expectation that uv- ( or sed- ) based sfrs should diverge from h@xmath3-based ones  which we consider to be more reliable than the former  for galaxies with large sfrs , as an increasing fraction of the nebular line and bolometric luminosities arise from regions of higher dust covering fraction",
    ". the statistics indicating an increasing sfr(h@xmath3)/sfr(uv ) ratio with sfr(h@xmath3 ) are consistent with this scheme .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the comparison of uv and ir - based sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the former generally underpredict the latter for galaxies where most of the star formation occurs in optically - thick regions that are essentially `` invisible '' in the uv . because the attenuation curve derived for the continuum is most sensitive to the less - reddened stellar populations in a galaxy , it is not surprising that inferences of total sfrs based on the uv continuum emission will underestimate the total sfr for very dusty galaxies .",
    "the assumption of uv- or sed - based sfrs may also lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the dependence of the difference in color excess between the stars and ionized gas , and the ssfr ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : ebmvcompare ] and [ fig : prescription ] ) .",
    "thus , the common practice of assuming either equal color excesses of the ionized gas and stellar continuum , or assuming that the ionized gas color excess is systematically larger than that of the stellar continuum , may lead to incorrect inferences of the sfrs .",
    "we also highlight the importance of treating the nebular emission and stellar continuum with the appropriate attenuation / extinction curves . here , we have made independent measurements of the color excess of the ionized gas ( aided by the balmer decrement ) , and have calculated the the attenuation curve relevant for the stellar continuum . based on these analyses",
    ", we find disparities between the h@xmath3- and uv - based sfrs that signify a varying contribution of dusty stellar populations to the bolometric luminosities of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we use a sample of 224 star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath375 with measurement of h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission lines from the mosdef survey to investigate the effects of dust on the stellar continuum of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "our analysis suggests that the reddening of the uv continuum with increasing balmer line opacity is most directly tied to dust obscuration .",
    "we calculate the attenuation curve by constructing , and taking ratios of , the composite photometric measurements of galaxies in bins of specific sfr and balmer optical depth . the attenuation curve derived here",
    "is very similar in shape to that of the smc curve at @xmath7 .",
    "blueward of this wavelength , the curve has a shape that is identical to , but with a normalization that is @xmath376 lower than , that of the @xcite attenuation curve .",
    "moreover , we find a marginal trend between the depth of absorption at @xmath11 and the color excess of the stellar continuum .",
    "we explore the implications for the attenuation curve on the stellar populations and sfrs of high - redshift galaxies . in general , the new attenuation curve implies slightly redder color excesses ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath9 lower sfrs , and stellar masses that are @xmath377dex lower , than those computed using the typically assumed starburst attenuation curve @xcite . we also find that while the color excess of the ionized gas is similar to that of the stellar continuum for about half of the objects in our sample , the difference in the reddening  and in the total attenuation  of the gas and stars in high - redshift galaxies is a strong function of sfr .",
    "in particular , we find that the ionized gas is more reddened relative to the stellar continuum with increasing sfr .",
    "our results are consistent with a simple picture in which the uv through optical continuum of high - redshift galaxies is dominated by a modestly reddened stellar population , while a second , dustier , stellar population begins to dominate the bolometric luminosity and nebular line luminosity with increasing sfr . in this picture , uv- and sed - based sfrs may diverge from ( i.e. , underpredict ) the total sfr even for galaxies with relatively modest h@xmath3-based sfrs ( @xmath378@xmath13yr@xmath14 ) .",
    "our analysis and results demonstrate the utility of using high quality near - ir spectroscopic data , along with multi - wavelength photometry , to directly measure the attenuation curve at high redshift .",
    "further spectroscopy from the ongoing mosdef survey , along with deep mid- and far - ir imaging data , will allow us to build upon these results , and will be crucial for removing a key uncertainty ( namely the shape and normalization of the attenuation curve ) in the measurement of star - formation rates and the interpretation of stellar populations in the distant universe .",
