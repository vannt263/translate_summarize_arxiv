    "it is well known that cw - complexes are spaces which are built up out of simple building blocks or _ cells . in this case , balls are used as models for the cells and these are attached step by step using _ attaching maps , which are defined in the boundary spheres of the balls . since their introduction by j.h.c .",
    "whitehead in the late fourties @xcite , cw - complexes have played an essential role in geometry and topology .",
    "the combinatorial structure of these spaces allows the development of tools and results ( e.g. simplicial and cellular aproximations , whitehead theorem , homotopy excision , etc . ) which lead to a deeper insight of their homotopy and homology properties . _",
    "_    the main properties of cw - complexes arise from the following two basic facts : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-ball @xmath1 is the topological ( reduced ) cone of the @xmath2-sphere @xmath3 and ( 2 ) the @xmath0-sphere is the ( reduced ) @xmath0-suspension of the @xmath4-sphere @xmath5 . for example , the homotopy extension properties of cw - complexes are deduced from ( 1 ) , since the inclusion of the @xmath2-sphere in the @xmath0-disk is a closed cofibration .",
    "item ( 2 ) is closely related to the definition of classical homotopy groups of spaces and it is used to prove results such as whitehead theorem or homotopy excision and in the construction of eilenberg - maclane spaces .",
    "these two basic facts suggest also that one might replace the original",
    "_ core @xmath5 by any other space @xmath6 and construct spaces built up out of cells of different _ shapes or _ types using suspensions and cones of the base space @xmath6 .",
    "_ _ _    the main purpose of this paper is to develop the theory of such spaces .",
    "more precisely , we define the notion of cw - complexes of type @xmath6 ( or cw(a)-spaces for short ) generalizing cw - complexes ( which constitute a special case of cw(a)-complexes , when @xmath7 ) . as in the classical case ,",
    "we study these spaces from two different points of view : the constructive and the descriptive approachs .",
    "we use both points of view to prove generalizations of classical results such as whitehead theorem and use these new results to study their homotopy properties .    of course , some classical results are no longer true for general cores @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the notion of dimension of a space ( as a cw(a)-complex ) is not always well defined .",
    "recall that in the classical case , the good definition of dimension is deduced from the famous invariance of dimension theorem . by a similar argument",
    ", we can prove that in particular cases ( for example when the core @xmath6 is itself a finite dimensional cw - complex ) the dimension of a cw(a)-complex is well defined .",
    "we study this and other invariants and exhibit many examples and counterexamples to clarify the main concepts .",
    "it is clear that , in general , a topological space may admit many different decompositions into cells of different types .",
    "we study the relationship between such different decompositions .",
    "in particular , we obtain results such as the following .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath8-complex of finite dimension and let @xmath9 be a generalized @xmath10-complex . then @xmath9 is a generalized @xmath8-complex .",
    "in particular , if @xmath6 is a standard finite dimensional cw - complex , then @xmath9 is a generalized cw - complex and therefore it has the homotopy type of a cw - complex .    by a generalized complex we mean a space which is obtained by attaching cells in countable many steps , allowing cells of any dimension to be attached in any step .",
    "we also analyze the changing of the core @xmath6 by a core @xmath11 via a map @xmath12 and obtain the following result .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath11 be pointed topological spaces with closed base points , let @xmath9 be a cw(@xmath6 ) and let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be continuous maps .    1 .   if @xmath15 , then there exists a cw(@xmath11 ) @xmath16 and maps @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a homotopy equivalence , then there is a cw(@xmath11 ) @xmath16 and a homotopy equivalence @xmath17 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath15 and @xmath21 then there exists a cw(@xmath11 ) @xmath16 and maps @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath22 .    in particular , when the core @xmath6 is contractible , all cw(@xmath6)-complexes are also contractible .",
    "finally we start developing the homotopy theory of these spaces and obtain the following generalization of whitehead theorem .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath16 be @xmath10-complexes and let @xmath23 be a continuous map .",
    "then @xmath24 is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it is an @xmath6-weak equivalence .",
    "we emphasize that our approach tries to keep the geometric intuition of whitehead s original theory .",
    "there exist many generalizations of cw - complexes in the literature .",
    "we especially recommend baues generalization of complexes in cofibration categories @xcite .",
    "there is also a categorical approach to cell complexes by the first named author of this paper @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the geometric point of view that we take in this article is that it allows the generalization of the most important classical results for cw - complexes and these new results can be applied in several concrete examples .    throughout this paper , all spaces",
