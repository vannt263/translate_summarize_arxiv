    "effective models of baryons which are based on three constituents ( @xmath0 ) share a common spin - flavor - color structure but differ in their assumptions on the spatial dynamics . for example , quark potential models in nonrelativistic @xcite or relativized @xcite forms emphasize the single - particle aspects of quark dynamics for which only a few low - lying configurations in the confining potential contribute significantly to the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . on the other hand , some regularities in the observed spectra , such as linear regge trajectories and parity doubling , hint that an alternative , collective type of dynamics may play a role in the structure of baryons .    in this contribution",
    "we discuss a collective model within the context of an algebraic approach @xcite and present some results for electromagnetic form factors @xcite and strong decay widths @xcite .",
    "1.75 in    we consider a collective model in which the baryon resonances are interpreted in terms of rotations and vibrations of the string configuration in fig .",

    "the spatial part is characterized by the labels : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the vibrations ( stretching and bending ) of the string configuration in fig .  [ rb : geometry ] ; @xmath5 denotes the projection of the rotational angular momentum @xmath6 on the body - fixed symmetry - axis and @xmath7 the parity .",
    "finally , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin and the total angular momentum @xmath10  . in this contribution",
    "we focus on the nucleon resonances which are interpreted as rotational excitations of the @xmath11 vibrational ground state .",
    "the electromagnetic ( strong ) coupling is assumed to involve the absorption or emission of a photon ( elementary meson ) from a single constituent . the collective form factors and decay widths",
    "are obtained by folding with a probability distribution for the charge and magnetization along the strings of fig .",
    "[ rb : geometry ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a radial coordinate and @xmath14 is a scale parameter . in the algebraic approach",
    "these form factors and decay widths can be obtained in closed analytic form ( in the limit of a large model space ) which allows us to do a straightforward and systematic analysis of the experimental data .",
    "the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ gbeta ] ) for the probability distribution is made to obtain a dipole form for the proton electric form factor @xmath15 the same distribution is used to calculate transition form factors and decay widths . as a result , all collective form factors are found to drop as powers of the momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "this property is well - known experimentally and is in contrast with harmonic oscillator based quark models in which all form factors fall off exponentially .",
    "electromagnetic inelastic form factors can be measured in electroproduction of baryon resonances . they are expressed in terms of helicity amplitudes @xmath16 , where @xmath17 indicates the helicity and @xmath18 represents proton ( @xmath19 ) or neutron ( @xmath20 ) couplings . in a string - like model of hadrons",
    "one expects @xcite on the basis of qcd that strings will elongate ( hadrons swell ) as their energy increases .",
    "this effect can be easily included in the present analysis by making the scale parameters of the strings energy- dependent .",
    "we use here the simple ansatz @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nucleon mass and @xmath23 the resonance mass .",
    "this ansatz introduces a new parameter ( @xmath24 ) , the stretchability of the string .",

    "[ rb : d13 ] we show the transverse helicity amplitudes @xmath25 for the @xmath26 resonance calculated in the breit frame ( a factor of @xmath27 is suppressed ) .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath14 is determined in a simultaneous fit to the nucleon charge radii and the nucleon elastic form factors : @xmath28 fm @xcite .",
    "the effect of stretching on the helicity amplitudes is sizeable ( especially if one takes the value @xmath29 which is suggested by qcd arguments @xcite and the regge behavior of nucleon resonances ) .",
    "the data for @xmath26 ( and also for @xmath30 ) show a clear indication that the form factors are dropping faster than expected on the basis of the dipole form .",
    "the disagreement at low momentum transfer may be due to the neglect of the meson cloud .",

    "we consider decays with emission of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "( [ gbeta ] ) .",
    "these parameters are determined from a least - square fit to the @xmath31 partial widths ( which are relatively well known ) with the exclusion of the @xmath37 resonances whose assignments are not clear due to possible mixing between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 and/or the possible presence of a third @xmath37 resonance @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath31 decay widths is found to be in fair agreement with experiment ( see table  [ rb : strong ] ) .",
    "these results are to a large extent a consequence of spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "the calculated widths for the @xmath32 channel are systematically small .",
    "we emphasize here that , since the transition operator was determined from the @xmath31 decays , the @xmath34 decays are calculated without introducing any further parameters .",
    "the results of this analysis suggest that the large @xmath34 width for the @xmath40 is not due to a conventional @xmath41 state .",
    "one possible explanation is the presence of another state in the same mass region , _",
    "e.g. _ a quasi - bound meson - baryon @xmath8 wave resonance just below or above threshold , for example @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is an exotic configuration of four quarks and one antiquark ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we have analyzed simultaneously electromagnetic form factors and strong decay widths in a collective model of the nucleon .",

    "the same distribution function is used to calculate the transition form factors for the excited baryons . as a result ,",
    "all form factors drop as powers of the momentum transfer .    for electromagnetic couplings",
    "we find that the inclusion of the stretching of baryons improves the calculation of the helicity amplitudes for large values of the momentum transfer .",
    "the disagreement for small values of the momentum transfer @xmath46 ( gev / c)@xmath47 may be due to coupling of the photon to the meson cloud ,",
    "_ i.e. _ configurations of the type @xmath48 . since such configurations have much larger spatial extent than @xmath41",
    ", their effects are expected to drop faster with momentum transfer than the constituent form factors .",

    "our calculations do not show any indication for a large @xmath34 width , as is observed for the @xmath40 resonance .",
