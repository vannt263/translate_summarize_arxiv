    "one of the major unsolved questions in modern astronomy is understanding galaxy formation and evolution . the hierarchical clustering scenario , motivated by the inflationary cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology ,",
    "has served as the main theoretical background to address this question ( for a recent review see firmani & avila - reese 2003 ) . from the observational side ,",
    "two types of information have been used : ( i ) detailed studies of local galaxies interpreted as fossil records of the formation process , and ( ii ) the rapidly increasing observational data of the universe at large redshifts . an important question regarding the latter item",
    "is the identification of properties which can be fairly compared among the galaxy populations at different redshifts .",
    "the correct identification and measurement of these properties is essential to infer empirically how the present - day galaxy populations formed .",
    "some optical morphological features along the hubble - sequence have been used as the primary characteristic to describe local normal galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , these features describe only the `` tip of the iceberg '' in galaxies .",
    "some morphological features are thought to be related to transient internal dynamical and luminous ( star formation ) processes rather than to long - term fundamental physical properties of galaxies ( van den bergh 1998 ; conselice 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been shown that gross morphological characteristics change with wavelength @xcite , making it even more difficult to use them as a basis for a physical classification of galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , a high fraction of distant galaxies look peculiar and can not be placed onto the hubble sequence @xcite suggesting that there must be a physical cause for this change ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "these facts have motivated the search for quantitative physical indices , which would allow galaxies to be classified in different stages of their evolution @xcite . in this spirit , the latter authors and conselice ( 2003 ) have proposed three structural indices to distinguish galaxies at different stages of evolution , namely the concentration of stellar light ( @xmath1 ) , the asymmetry in the light distribution ( @xmath2 ) , and a measure of its clumpiness ( @xmath3 ) .    according to the galaxy formation picture based on the hierarchical cdm cosmogony , disk galaxies assembly generically inside cdm halos .",
    "the main properties of the disks are determined largely by the halo mass aggregation history ( and its related concentration ) , and by the halo angular momentum @xcite . on the other hand , in the hierarchical picture",
    ", the morphological characteristics of galaxies may change several times during its evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the structure of a galaxy at a given time reveals its present and past formation history .",
    "the @xmath4 morphology system was designed and tested to reveal the major properties of galaxies ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter is related to the scale of a galaxy ( mass , size ) and its halo angular momentum , in particular the spin parameter , which is roughly constant in time for most of the halos .",
    "@xmath1 could slightly change ( increase ) with time depending on the galaxy mass accretion rate and relaxation history .",
    "strong changes are expected only when dissipative major mergers happen ( when a spheroid forms , for example ) .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter , which traces recent star formation ( sf ) @xcite , is expected to change the most with time for a given galaxy as sf occurs .",
    "the sf rate history of isolated normal disk galaxies is predicted to increase smoothly , on average by a factor of @xmath8 , from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and then to decrease slightly at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , interactions may abruptly enhance sf ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2001 ) , increasing @xmath3 in this case .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath2 is expected to change significantly during interactions and mergers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 parameters therefore may trace out fundamental physical stages of galaxy evolution , as well as possible transient processes related to interactions . in the hierarchical scenario",
    "the rate of halo major mergers increases dramatically with redshift @xcite .",
    "observations show that in the local universe only about @xmath11 of galaxies are in interacting pairs @xcite , but this fraction increases significantly with redshift as shown for a galaxy sample up to @xmath12 @xcite . from these data and assuming short merging time scales ( @xmath13 gyr ) , the latter authors infer that the merging rate increases as @xmath14 . thus , at @xmath15 , the merging rate would be @xmath16 times the present one .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath15 the observed fraction of galaxies with asymmetric features typical of a recent merger was found to be as large as 50% for the most luminous and massive sources",

    "the detailed study of the local interacting pairs is crucial for understanding the structures of high - redshift galaxies . in this spirit",
    ", the aim of the present paper is to study @xmath4 parameters and correlations for a local sample of spirals in pairs , and compare them with the @xmath4 parameters for a reference sample of non - interacting galaxies and a sample of merging galaxies , namely ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "this further allows us to determine what physical processes are required to change the morphologies of galaxies .",
    "we explore how different stages of interactions affect the structure , morphology , and sf properties of galaxies as revealed through @xmath4 parameters . in a subsequent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) , the correlations of the @xmath4 parameters with other galaxy properties in pairs will be explored in order to gain insight on the significance of these parameters for understanding galaxy interactions and evolution .    to address these questions",

    "in section 3 we present the @xmath4 parameters in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands for the ( s+s ) pairs and compare their loci in the @xmath4 volume with that of the reference samples of isolated galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "the results are discussed and interpreted in   [ s4 ] . in   [ s5 ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the ( s+s ) sample used in this paper is a collection of 66 disk galaxies in pairs observed by hernndez - toledo & puerari ( 2001 ) and selected from the catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the ( s+s ) pairs occupy a special place among physical binaries .",
    "they represent a good laboratory from which to study secular evolution due to interactions . these pairs",
    "are also thought to be the precursors of major galaxy mergers that likely dominate the process through which massive galaxies form ( conselice et al . 2003a , b ) .",
    "the selection criteria applied yields a sample that is biased against the presence of mergers since only components with discernible diameters were selected .",
    "instead , a wide range of separations and morphological features , presumably associated with tidal interactions , are present .",
    "the mean projected separation of the components in the sample is @xmath22 h@xmath23kpc , with the closest and widest systems separated by @xmath24 and @xmath25h@xmath23kpc , respectively .",
    "the sample is restricted to an isolated environment , where only very small neighbors are allowed around each component . from the isolation criteria , for a circle of diameter equal to the pair projected separation around each component , the aparent diameter of any possible neighbor can not exceed 1/5th the diameter of the secondary component .",
    "smaller galaxies and/or fainter than m@xmath26= 15.7 m ( the limit magnitude of the sample ) , might be present in these pairs .",
    "although small satellite galaxies may have some influence on the morphological ( @xmath4 ) properties of the pair components , one expects that these properties in our sample are affected mainly by the effects of the mutual interactions between the pair components .",
    "hernndez - toledo & puerari ( 2001 ) obtained deep images in the johnson - cousins @xmath0 photometric system with typical integration times of 40 , 25 , 10 and 10 minutes respectively .",
    "the images were acquired using two telescopes : the guillermo haro observatory ( gho ) 2.1 m telescope at cananea , sonora and the observatorio astronmico nacional ( oan ) 1.5 m telescope at san pedro mrtir , baja california , both in mxico and under reasonable seeing conditions ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the data are sensitive enough to detect faint stellar tidal structures .",
    "this is important in order of not biassing the @xmath4 estimates for a local reference sample of interacting galaxies .",
    "if a typical size of @xmath28 arcmin / galaxy is considered , an average number of 50 resolution elements / galaxy are reasonable enough to avoid underestimations of the @xmath4 parameters .",

    "two telescopes were used to acquire these images ; the lowell 1.1 m and the palomar 1.5 m with a typical resolution @xmath29 . a typical scale of @xmath30 arcmin / galaxy renders an average number of 90 resolution elements / galaxy .",
    "this is an important requisite for a local reference sample of non - interacting galaxies that we use for comparative purposes .",

    "@xmath2 is also measured within @xmath42 . for a full detailed description see conselice et al .",
    "the asymmetry index is sensitive to any feature that produces asymmetric light distributions .",
    "this includes sf , galaxy interactions / mergers , and projection effects such as dust lanes .    * clumpiness @xmath46 : * galaxies undergoing sf are very patchy and contain large amounts of light at high spatial frequency . to quantify this , the clumpiness index s is defined as the ratio of the amount of light contained in high frequency structures to the total amount of light in the galaxy within @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "light contamination effects are expected in paired galaxies of similar diameters and @xmath54 or in paired galaxies with different diameters and @xmath55 . if the light of the companion enters within the @xmath42 of a given galaxy , then the observed @xmath56",
    "could be biased to a larger value , depending on the type of deformation induced to a `` pre - contaminated '' light profile .",
    "this will certainly affect the measured value of @xmath4 parameters : @xmath1 probably will increase ( section  [ s4 ] ; paper ii ) , @xmath2 , due to the obvious asymmetrical light contamination , will increase , and @xmath3 will also tend to increase but probably to a lesser extent .",
    "this was indeed the case for 10 galaxies in our closest pairs , for which a correcting procedure described below was applied .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath4 parameters in the s+s pairs was carried out in several steps : ( i ) close field and overlapping stars were removed from each image ; ( ii ) sky background was also removed from the images by fitting a polynomial function that yielded the lowest possible residual after subtraction ; ( iii ) the center of each galaxy was considered as the barycenter of the light distribution and the starting point for measurements ( conselice 2003 ) ; ( iv ) the @xmath4 parameters for pairs with @xmath52 , as well as with @xmath53 but where the companion galaxy is beyond 2 times the @xmath48 of the primary , were estimated directly , i.e. individual components were not considered to be influenced by light contamination from the companion ; ( v ) closest pairs ( those with @xmath53 and where the companion galaxy is within 1.5 times the @xmath48 of the primary ) are considered as light - contaminated by the companion . in these cases , a decontamination procedure consists first of building a model of the pair component @xmath57 , called @xmath58 , by using the task bmodel in iraf .",

    "after subtracting a model galaxy to the original galaxy , yielded in most of the cases , traces of underlying structures .",
    "in such cases , these remaining features were masked or interpolated before measuring the @xmath4 parameters .",
    "in one case ( kpg 347 ) , the overlapping degree makes it more than difficult to apply this procedure and thus we remove this pair from further analysis .",

    "alternatively , a paired tp test that takes into account point - by - point effects in the two samples indicate that the @xmath2 parameter is significantly different at the 99 % level ( against the 90 % level for the @xmath3 parameter ) . however , an f test for testing the hypothesis that two samples have different variances indicates different variances in these cases .",
    "thus caution must be taken about the interpretation of the differences in means of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter , and in a lesser extent the @xmath2 parameter ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) , are related to sf activity , which is better traced by the bluer bands than by the redder ones .",
    "this hints that the observed differences in @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be real .    on the other hand , the average concentration @xmath1 parameter decreases on average from @xmath21 toward @xmath18 bands .",
    "since the samples show no significant difference in variances , a paired tp test supports this result at the 97 % level .",
    "it is well known that galaxy light distributions are more extended ( less concentrated ) in bluer bands than in red bands @xcite . however , it is possible that another effect for interacting galaxies , discussed in  4 , works in the opposite direction , by increasing @xmath1 in bluer bands .",
    "the level of change observed in the @xmath4 parameters of interacting galaxies from @xmath18 to @xmath21 bands implies that the sf activity and morphological properties of disk galaxies are not strongly affected by the interaction , at least in periods of @xmath83 gyr , which are larger than the typical merging time scale for these interacting galaxies .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison between ( s+s ) pairs and the isolated galaxy control sample in projections of @xmath4 space .",

    "this shows that galaxy structures , morphologies and sf activity are not strongly affected by long - term galaxy interactions or secular evolution . as a guideline for the eye ,",
    "we have applied a linear regression fitting ( bisector ) to the ( s)frei sample data ( dashed line ) and the ( s+s ) pair sample ( only @xmath85 galaxies , solid line ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath82 as well as the closest pair kpg347 , were not taken into account in the fit .",
    "we used a bisector regression because we do not know a priori which are the physically independent variables in each diagram @xcite .",
    "some systematic differences can be seen : for the isolated galaxies some correlation appears in the @xmath64 , @xmath7 and @xmath65 diagrams ( pearson correlation coefficients , r , of @xmath86 , 0.74 , and @xmath87 , respectively ) , while for the paired galaxies a correlation is marginally significant only in the @xmath7 diagram ( r=0.68 ) .",
    "isolated galaxies exhibit a clear tendency to be more asymmetric and patchy at lower concentration values ( and later hubble types ) . paired",
    "galaxies with @xmath52 ( wide pairs ) follow a similar trend in the @xmath7 plane , although with a larger scatter . for galaxies in close pairs ( @xmath85 ) ,",
    "a clearer tendency to deviate from these correlations in the @xmath65 and @xmath64 diagrams is observed , with several of the most concentrated pairs with large clumpinesses and asymmetries ( see also the @xmath18 band results in fig .",

    "additionally , averages and @xmath88 deviations corresponding to galaxies in close and wide ( @xmath53 and @xmath52 ) pairs and ulirgs in advanced stage of merging , i.e. , excluding ulirgs whose images still show discernible components ( see below ) , are also presented .",
    "the mean values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters for close pairs ( @xmath53 ) in the @xmath20 band are @xmath6 and @xmath89 times larger than those for the isolated galaxies , respectively .",
    "a t test supports this result at the 99.9 and 99.8 % level , respectively .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test also shows different distributions in the samples for both parameters at a high significance level ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , gravitational interactions tend to increase more quickly the global asymmetry than the clumpiness , consistent with asymmetries being more sensitive to the effect of ongoing galaxy interactions / mergers ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the observed asymmetry is consistent with the results of iono et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who have recently investigated the detailed response of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 structural parameters for both the stellar and gaseous components in different stages of a disk - disk collision .",
    "they predict an increase in the stellar asymmetry of a factor @xmath92 over a period of @xmath93 years that is maintained in amplitude until the end of their simulations .",
    "these authors comment that the small dynamic range predicted for @xmath2 simply reflects the intrinsic axisymmetric nature of the tidally induced features and that blindly applying the parameter @xmath2 to examine the degree of tidal disturbance therefore can result in large uncertainties . regarding this last point",
    ", we argue that well - selected and deeply observed samples like the s+s pairs , with a wide range of orbital parameters and morphological features , are necessary .",
    "on the other hand , the student s t test shows no significant difference in the means for the @xmath1 parameter of pairs and the reference frei sample . if we consider that in ( s+s ) paired galaxies , early hubble types are overabundant with respect to the reference sample ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and that @xmath1 for the reference galaxies increases in average as the type is earlier ( conselice 2003 , table 6 ) , then higher average values of @xmath1 in pairs than in isolated galaxies are naively expected .",
    "however , galaxy interactions could affect not only the morphologycal type but also the concentration parameter @xmath1 ( e.g. , iono et al .",
    "2004 ) , in such a way that it would not be correct to use the @xmath94 dependence of the reference galaxies for the ( s+s ) pairs .",
    "in fact , we find that there is some trend in paired galaxies to have higher concentrations as the parameter @xmath95 is smaller .",
    "figure 6 shows a comparison of the ( s+s ) pairs ( circles and squares ) and the 66 ulirgs ( ongoing major mergers , dots ) (  2 ) in @xmath4 structural space .",
    "paired galaxies tend to be , on average , significantly less patchy , concentrated , and asymmetric than ulirgs .",
    "the t test supports the differences in means for the @xmath2 parameter at the 96.5 % level .",
    "however , an f test indicates significantly different variances in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 parameters , complicating the interpretation of these differences .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test however , supports significant differences in the distribution of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 parameters at the 95 and 99 % level respectively .",
    "notice that ulirgs are commonly considered as individual objects , and in consequence their @xmath4 values were measured as such ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "however , from a visual examination of the hst images , we find that a fraction of the ulirgs still show discernible components .",
    "although a discussion on whether these objects should be considered as individuals or not is out of the scope of the present work , we identify in fig . 6 these ulirgs in process of merging with an extra cross . in fig .",
    "6 ulirgs show larger scatter than ( s+s ) pairs in the three projections of the @xmath4 space .",
    "this is supported in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 parameters by the results of the f test .",
    "however , an important contribution to this scatter comes namely from the ulirgs with discernible components ( crosses ) , especially in the @xmath3 parameter .    in the @xmath7 plane several of the highly asymmetric ulirgs tend to be more patchy than the highly asymmetric paired galaxies .",

    "our results show that the structural / sf / morphological properties of interacting galaxies change significantly only when the interaction becomes very strong just before the merger commences ; the time scale to produce these changes is of the order of the merging time , roughly 0.15 - 0.5 gyr . a note of caution .",
    "these small time scales imply that the fraction of recently merged systems ( c.f .",

    "the order @xmath107 has been suggested ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2001 ) as a sequence from strongest to weakest evidence for tidal distortion or , alternatively , most to least dynamically evolved ( interpreting a common envelope as a sign of extensive dynamical evolution in pairs ) .",
    "the strongest @xmath102deviations in fig .",
    "8 correspond to the @xmath103 and @xmath104 galaxies in the @xmath7 diagram , while pairs belonging to @xmath105 and @xmath106 classes show less than 2-@xmath102deviations from the reference isolated galaxies .",
    "the relative fraction of galaxies above 2-@xmath102 of the reference level are 75% , 60% , 40% and 38% for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath106 and @xmath105 classes , respectively .",
    "the results in figs . 7 and 8 are further evidence that the @xmath7 diagram can be used as a indicator for strong or dynamically evolved interactions .",
    "we have discussed previously that interactions do not increase clumpiness values ( @xmath3 ) as much as they do the asymmetries ( @xmath2 ) of galaxies ( see the trends for isolated and paired galaxies in the @xmath7 diagram of fig . 5 ) . according to our results ,",
    "the average value of @xmath3 for close paired galaxies is @xmath89 times larger than the corresponding average for isolated galaxies .",
    "this enhancement factor is similar to the average one ( @xmath108 ) in the optical luminosity of the late - type pair components relative to isolated galaxy control samples .",
    "this has been interpreted as the optical signature of the interaction - sf connection ( e.g. , hernndez - toledo et al . 1999 ) .",
    "all these pieces of evidence show that while the interaction level traced by the asymmetry @xmath2 becomes significant , the interaction - induced sf rate increases only moderately in pair galaxies , suggesting that the sf activity in disk galaxies could be more related to internal processes rather than to external ones @xcite .",
    "the sf rate in isolated disk galaxies varies by about a factor of ten ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , when the interaction is strong and properly corresponds to the merging phase , the @xmath3 parameter increases significantly , as it is seen in the ulirgs ( fig . 6 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the ( s+s ) pairs also show a systematic increase in their @xmath100-deviations from the reference isolated galaxies in the @xmath7 plane as @xmath95 decreases ( see fig .",
    "a similar trend with sep was found for the 25@xmath109m - to-@xmath50band ( and fir - to-@xmath18-band ) luminosity ratio in ( s+s ) pairs and ( e+s ) pairs ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "consistent with these results , barton et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) suggested previously that the strengths and the ages of triggered bursts of sf depend on the galaxy separation on the sky .",
    "a confrontation of their starburst models to observations indicates that the strongest bursts of sf occur only in the tightest orbits , giving rise to a burst strength - separation correlation .",
    "the burst of sf triggered by the close galaxy - galaxy pass continues and ages as the galaxies move apart .",
    "however , it is important to notice that the underlaying scenario of triggered sf in the barton et al .",
    "( 2000,2003 ) work is the density - driven model of sf , where the interaction induces a large central gas concentration .",
    "therefore , the burst of sf occurs mainly in the central regions ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) . with this model",
    "it has been possible to produce starbursts comparable to those inferred in ulirgs .",
    "nevertheless large - scale , prompt and diverse sf activity is also seen in many interacting galaxies .",
    "an alternative mechanism for triggered sf is the shock - induced model of sf ( jog & salomon 1992 ) . at odds to the density - driven model ,",
    "recent simulations using the shock - induced sf ( barnes 2004 ) show that ( i ) the sf response to the interaction is immediate , the burst being produced mainly at pericenter , ( ii ) the sf is spatially extended because the gas is more widely distributed , ( iii ) the different encounter geometry may yield a variety of sf rate histories . the confrontation of observations with models of spectro - photometric evolution in barton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , although applied mainly to the central regions of interacting galaxies , suggests indeed that the ages and strengths of triggered bursts of sf depend on the galaxy separation .",
    "however , in the density - driven sf model such a dependence is hard to predict since the burst is delayed until the gas density has had time to build up in the center , which may happen a long time after the pericenter pass .",
    "a corolary of item ( ii ) is that the surface brightness profiles in the bluer bands should become , if any , more extended than in the pre - burst galaxy , but not more concentrated . to this respect",
    "we have noted two trends in our paired sample : several of the close pairs tend to have a low average @xmath50band surface brightness ( @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the effective radius ) , i.e. their @xmath111 apparently became larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 parameter for these galaxies is typically high .",
    "both effects can be explained together if the surface brightness profile increases externally , becoming shallower in the outer regions .",
    "for example , if an exponential surface brightness profile is gently flattened at the periphery ( e.g. , at radii @xmath112 of the @xmath42 ) then the @xmath1 parameter used here (  2 ) will increase slightly while @xmath113 will decrease .",
    "probably , both the density - driven and the shock - induced mechanisms for sf , are working in galaxies , with one or the other more important in different cases , from the isolated state to the merging phase .",
    "further theoretical and observational study will be important to clarify the mechanism of triggered sf in interacting galaxies .",
    "in conclusion , from our study of the @xmath4 parameters for a sample of local paired galaxies we find that the parameter @xmath3 , which directly correlates with sf activity ( conselice 2003 ) , increases systematically with decreasing projected separation ( in the plane of the sky ) , but this increasing is typically moderate .",
    "we also find that the concentration parameter @xmath1 in optical bands tends to be high for the most asymmetric and patchy paired galaxies , opposite to the tendency of isolated galaxies .",
    "this could be due to either a significant increasing of the central surface brightness in the interacting galaxy or to a flattening at the outskirts of its surface brightness profile . in the former case one",
    "expects that the effective radius will decrease and @xmath113 will increase .",
    "this topic will be carefully analyzed elsewhere ( paper ii ) . in the following , we discuss some possibilities that could produce a flattening of a surface brightness profile at the outskirts in an interacting galaxy .      in  3",
    "we have shown that some galaxies in close pairs exhibit an inverse tendency with respect to isolated galaxies in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 planes : their @xmath1 tend to be high for large clumpiness and asymmetry parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that close interactions may increase the concentration parameter of disks .",
    "as discussed in  4.2 , the @xmath1 parameter is sensitive to changes in both the outer ( @xmath114 ) surface brightness profile and the inner ( @xmath115 ) one . in the former case",
    ", a higher value of @xmath1 could be due to either ( a ) an outer flattening of the surface brightness profile ( see  4.2 ) or ( b ) a dynamical expansion of the outer disk .    in case ( a ) , the flattening may be produced by a light contamination effect or by an induced physical process in a galaxy disk .",
    "notice that we have mostly taken into account the contamination after applying a correction procedure described in  2.1 . a physical process related to interactions that could flatten",
    "the outer optical - band surface brightness profile is the shock - induced model of sf bursts due to interactions mentioned in  4.2 . since the gas surface density distribution of local galaxies is typically much more extended than the stellar surface density ( and with lower values in the central regions )",
    ", the distribution of the young stars , product of the shock - induced burst of sf , will also tend to be extended and with a _",
    "fractional _ contribution to the corresponding ( pre - burst ) surface brightness more significant at the periphery than in the central regions ( the gas surface density in local disk galaxies is typically even higher than the stellar one at the periphery ) .",
    "however , it should also be considered that differential rotation may decrease the molecular / neutral cloud formation in the periphery .",
    "nevertheless , recent numerical simulations of shock - induced sf ( instead of density - driven sf ) for an observed interacting galaxy tend to confirm that sf is induced along the whole disk ( barnes 2004 ) .    in case",
    "( b ) , iono et al ( 2004 ) have predicted , from numerical simulations of disk - disk collisions , a measurable change of the parameter @xmath1 . they have found that @xmath1 is more sensitive to the behavior of @xmath39 than to @xmath40 , because for the inner regions , the stars respond to the collision with significantly smaller amplitudes .",
    "it could also be that due to the interaction the disk suffers bar instabilities and , in this case along with bulge formation , the outer disk expands significantly ( valenzuela & klypin 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the predicted increasing of @xmath1 is the result of a ) the ejection of the outer stars into tidal tails and b ) a rapid expansion of the stellar disk outside the tidal radius .      by using a sample of ongoing major mergers ( the same ulirg sample used here ) , conselice ( 2003 ) established a criterion for recognizing merging galaxies : @xmath116 , where @xmath117 ) is the residual of the observed value with respect to a linear fitting to the sample of isolated galaxies in the @xmath7 plane . in the case of pairs , according to fig .",
    "7 approximately 55% ( 40% ) of the paired galaxies are above the @xmath101 ( @xmath118 ) level in this plane .",
    "two thirds of them have @xmath53 and most of the them have clear morphological signatures of strong interactions ( i.e. , tails , bridges , distortions ) . in fig .",
    "8 one sees that most of the interacting galaxies ( at and li interaction classes ) are above the @xmath119 level in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "therefore the criterion @xmath120 for paired interacting galaxies in the @xmath7 plane seems to be _ statistically _ adequate to identify these systems in an automated way .    on the other hand , we find that the deviations of the paired galaxies in @xmath7 space are slightly different to the pattern seen for ulirgs ( see fig .  6 , where ulirgs are more scattered than pairs , and with a tendency to increase @xmath3 steeply with @xmath2 than the paired galaxies ) .",
    "the major differences in the @xmath7 diagram are found for `` advanced '' ulirgs ; the @xmath2 parameter in this case is relatively small for the large values of the @xmath3 parameter , which trace the sf rate .",
    "nevertheless , even in these cases , the ulirg sf rate traced by the optical @xmath3 parameter is much smaller than the one inferred from the fir emission .",
    "finally , we notice that a merging limit criterion based only on the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath121 for example , conselice et al . 2003a ; conselice , chapman & windhorst 2003b ) should be complemented with the @xmath122deviation criterion when possible . in fig .",
    "9 , @xmath123 is plotted versus @xmath2 .",
    "there are several paired galaxies with @xmath124 but with deviations @xmath120 , that are in fact interacting . paired",
    "galaxies with @xmath125 , almost invariably deviate from the isolated ones by more than @xmath126 .",
    "a goal behind the introduction of the @xmath4 system is the evaluation of the structural and morphological evolution of galaxies .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the population of unobscured star - forming galaxies has dramatically changed around @xmath10 : at higher redshifts , the galaxy population was dominated by peculiar galaxies , while at lower redshifts , most of galaxies are already `` normal '' spirals and ellipticals ( conselice , blackburne & papovich 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the latter authors have measured the rest - frame @xmath50band @xmath4 parameters for a large sample of field galaxies in the hubble deep field north and south ( hdf - n & s ) out to @xmath15 .",
    "the high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath127 ) , which are mostly peculiars , show a clear deviation from the field low - redshift galaxies in the @xmath64 and @xmath7 diagrams .",
    "an interesting question is whether the @xmath4 parameters of these high - redshift peculiars look similar to those of the local interacting galaxies .",
    "the high - redshift peculiar galaxies from conselice et al . ( 2004 ) occupy the @xmath7 plane ( see their fig .",
    "19 ) with values of @xmath2 and especially of @xmath3 , much smaller on average than those of our local sample of pair ( s+s ) galaxies .",
    "one expects some systematic under - estimating of @xmath3 and @xmath2 with redshift for disks due to resolution effects ( see fig . 16 in conselice et al .",
    "2003b , and table 1 in conselice et al .",
    "taking into account these effects , the loci of the hdf - ns peculiar galaxies with redshifts higher than @xmath92 in the @xmath7 plane become closer to the location of our local pairs .",
    "however , it is difficult to identify both families of objects in the @xmath64 plane as likely similar .",
    "the high - redshift peculiars have concentrations smaller on average than the local pair galaxies . the resolution effect for the high - redshift disks does not affect significantly the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "thus , according to the @xmath4 system , a preliminary statement is that most of the hdf high - redshift peculiars are similar to local starburst galaxies rather than to our whole sample of local pair ( s+s ) galaxies .",
    "of course , there is an overlapping in the @xmath4 space of both group of galaxies ( fig .",
    "5 ) , reflecting the fact that some starburst galaxies originate in interacting systems . it",
    "should also be taken into account that galaxies at high - redshifts are much more gas rich than the present ones .",
    "a more careful comparison and interpretation of local and high - redshift galaxies based on the @xmath4 system will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have measured @xmath4 parameters in @xmath0 bands for a sample of 66 galaxies in ( s+s ) pairs ( hernndez - toledo & puerari 2001 ) and carried out a comparison analysis in two steps : 1 ) an inter - band internal comparison of the @xmath4 parameters in ( s+s ) pairs and 2 ) an @xmath20 band comparison in the @xmath4 structural space among ( s+s ) pairs and two samples with similarly compiled parameters , the ( s)frei control sample of isolated galaxies and 66 ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "this has allowed us to gain insight on how morphology and sf changes as a function of interaction / mergers and recognize time - scales and physical effects that drive the evolution of these galaxy features .",
    "our main conclusions are as follow :    \\(i ) the differences in @xmath4 parameters for paired galaxies from the @xmath18 to @xmath21 bands is in general and on average small , suggesting that the optical @xmath4 parameters are stable galaxy properties until the beginning of a strong interaction .",
    "the average concentration @xmath1 parameter decreases on average from @xmath21 to @xmath18 bands , consistent with the finding that galaxy light distributions are more extended ( less concentrated ) in bluer bands than in red bands @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the @xmath4 parameters of paired galaxies change depending on the separation parameter @xmath95 , in the sense that the @xmath4 parameters for the widest and closest paired galaxies tend to be closer to those of isolated and ongoing major mergers ( ulir ) galaxies , respectively .",
    "the mean values of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters of the closest ( @xmath128 ) paired galaxies are 2.2 and 1.5 times larger than those of the isolated galaxies , respectively , i.e. , even in strongly interacting galaxies , the sf activity ( related to @xmath3 ) does not increase too much , suggesting that this activity is more related to internal processes rather than external ones .",
    "the deviations in the @xmath4 planes of pair galaxies with respect to the isolated ones increase significantly on average ( more than @xmath129 ) only for the closest galaxies and those galaxies with clear interaction signatures ( figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "nevertheless , there are also paired galaxies with @xmath53 but within the @xmath129 deviations , and pairs with @xmath52 but with deviations larger than @xmath129 .",
    "this diversity suggests that galaxies in our sample of ( s+s ) pairs are in different dynamical and morphological stages , from non - interacting to strong interacting , where the projected separation @xmath95 is only an approximate ( statistical ) criterion of interaction .",
    "\\(iii ) trends in @xmath4 space for the interacting galaxies differ from trends seen between @xmath4 values of isolated galaxies . within isolated systems",
    "lower concentration values ( @xmath1 ) correlate with larger @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters . for galaxies in close pairs ,",
    "these trends disappear and even revert for the most interacting galaxies : for several of them the larger @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the higher is @xmath1 .",
    "the concentration index for strongly interacting galaxies may become higher owing to a `` flattening '' in the outer surface - brightness profile produced by interaction - induced _ extended _ sf . in the @xmath7 plane , paired galaxies , in particular the closer ones , increase their @xmath2 with increasing @xmath3 more steeply than isolated galaxies .",
    "\\(iv ) on average paired galaxies are slightly less concentrated , asymmetric , and patchy than ulirgs , the significant difference being in the clumpiness .",
    "the latter display also a ( statistically significant ) larger scatter in the @xmath4 planes than the former .",
    "the major difference in trends between paired and ulirg galaxies is in the @xmath7 plane : the most patchy ulirgs have smaller asymmetries and slightly lower concentrations than the most patchy paired galaxies . the structural / sf / morphological properties of interacting galaxies",
    "change significantly only when the interaction becomes very strong .",
    "\\(v ) a criterion for picking up interacting galaxies that is based only on @xmath121 is marginally acceptable for paired galaxies .",
    "in fact there are some interacting galaxies with @xmath124 . a more robust _",
    "statistical _ criterion uses both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters : @xmath120 , where @xmath130 is the deviation of the interacting - galaxy @xmath2 parameter from the predicted one from the linear regression to the isolated sample in the @xmath7 diagram , and @xmath100 is the scatter of this fitting . for ongoing major mergers ( ulirgs ) the @xmath125 criteria",
    "is suitable .",
    "the summary of this work is that the quantitative structural and sf parameters of galaxies seem to change significantly only during the strong interaction / merger phases and within @xmath131 0.2 - 0.5 gyr .",
    "the use of the @xmath4 parameters to establish criteria for finding galaxies in strong interaction at high - redshift galaxies appears to hold up as it depends strongly on interaction stage ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
