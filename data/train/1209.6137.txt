    "our numerical data is in good agreement with @xmath209 , which is obtained from the phase - plane analysis .",
    "next , we consider the ordering dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ ke4 ] ) from a disordered state .",
    "we use the same numerical scheme described in sec .",
    "[ case1 ] . the initial state with massless quarks ( @xmath29 ) is now a metastable state of the potential , and phase separation proceeds via nucleation and growth of droplets of the preferred phase ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "therefore , the thermal noise @xmath56 must be sufficiently large to enable the system to escape from the metastable state on a reasonable time - scale : a suitable value for @xmath88 is @xmath211 .",
    "however , the asymptotic behavior of domain growth in both the unstable and metastable cases is insensitive to the noise term @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show the domain growth of the system for @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the frames are cross - section of the 3-@xmath22 snapshots at @xmath123 , and show the evolution of one of the preferred phases ( @xmath215 ) at times @xmath136 , @xmath216 and @xmath121 .",
    "typically , the evolution of the system begins with the nucleation of droplets in the early stages : droplets larger than a critical size @xmath217 ( supercritical ) grow , whereas those with @xmath218 ( subcritical ) shrink .",
    "in nucleation theory @xcite , @xmath217 is defined by the balance between _ free - energy reduction _ due to the appearance of the bulk droplet and _ free - energy increase _ due to the surface tension at the droplet boundary . in the present simulation , the critical radius of the bubble @xmath219 in dimensionless units . if we convert this into physical units , @xmath220 fm ( @xmath66=0.56 fm for @xmath71=10mev / fm@xmath2 ) .",

    "if we take the surface tension to be 10 mev / fm@xmath2 , then the critical bubble size is about 6 fm .",
    "the droplets grow very rapidly and fuse to form bi - continuous domain structures , a characteristic of late - stage domain growth .",
    "the effect of dissipation on nucleation and growth can be understood by comparing the evolution patterns at different @xmath63-values in fig .",
    "we observed that the system takes more time to nucleate for the limiting @xmath63-values ( i.e.,@xmath226 and @xmath227 ) .",
    "however , for intermediate values ( @xmath228 ) , it takes less time . to understand this behavior , we consider _",
    "kramer s escape problem _ for a barrier , as discussed by hanggi @xcite .",
    "hanggi studies the homogeneous version of eq .",
    "( [ ke4 ] ) , and the corresponding crossover time from @xmath29 ( the metastable state ) to @xmath215 ( the stable state ) .",
    "this crossover time is proportional to the nucleation time @xmath229 in our domain growth problem .",
    "we designate @xmath230 as the natural vibration frequency about the barrier location ( @xmath231 ) . for moderate to large dissipation ( @xmath232 ) , the nucleation time t_n ~ ( - ) ^-1 , so that @xmath233 as @xmath227",
    ". for small dissipation ( @xmath234 ) , we have t_n ~ , so that @xmath235 as @xmath226 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we plot the scaled correlation function for the evolution depicted in fig .",
    "all the data sets correspond to @xmath125 .",
    "again , we observe that the scaling functions are universal for the late - stage dynamics , subsequent to the nucleation regime .",
    "thus , in all cases considered here , the domain growth morphology is well - described by the ojk function in the asymptotic regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we plot the domain size [ @xmath128 vs. @xmath139 ] on a log - log scale .",
    "we observe that the growth process begins once the nucleation of droplets is over .",
    "the onset time for domain growth is the nucleation time @xmath229 , which is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for different values of @xmath63 .",
    "as expected from the earlier discussion , @xmath235 as @xmath226 or @xmath227 .",
    "the intermediate and asymptotic growth regimes are analogous to those described for fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , i.e. , crossover from @xmath237 to @xmath162 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we have focused on the @xmath63-dependence of @xmath229 , rather than the asymptotic growth laws .",
    "to conclude this paper , we summarize and discuss the results presented here .",
    "we have studied the kinetics of chiral phase transitions in strong interactions within the ambit of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model as an effective model to study chiral symmetry breaking and it restoration in qcd . .",
    "first , we have proposed a quantitative mapping between the free energy of the njl model , and the @xmath3-landau potential .",
    "this mapping enables us to identify the relevant time - scales and length - scales within the model kinetics . near the phase transition",
    ", we can relate ( @xmath238 ) to the coefficients of the landau model .",
    "however , we have considered parameter values far from the critical points , where it is more appropriate to interpret the landau coefficients as phenomenological quantities .    we have studied the kinetics of transitions from the massless quark ( disordered ) phase to the massive quark ( ordered ) phase , resulting from a sudden quench in the system parameters .",
    "we model the kinetics via a time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation with both dissipative and inertial terms .",
    "the inertial term arises naturally in the context of strong interaction kinetics , though it is usually neglected in condensed matter applications .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effect of the inertial term on phase - transition kinetics .    for deep quenches ,",
    "the massless phase is spontaneously unstable and evolves via _",
    "spinodal decomposition_. in the purely inertial case ( @xmath124 ) , we expect a rapid spinodal decomposition with growth law @xmath237 . in this limit",
    ", the order parameter value does not relax to an equilibrium value due to the oscillatory dynamics of the system . in the presence of dissipation ( @xmath239 )",
    ", there is a crossover at @xmath160 from the faster growth regime to cahn - allen ( ca ) growth with @xmath162 .",
    "further , the evolution morphologies show self - similar scaling , and can be quantitatively characterized by the order - parameter correlation function or its fourier transform , the structure factor .",
    "for shallow quenches through the i - order line , the massless phase is metastable .",
    "the system evolves via nucleation and the growth of droplets of the preferred phase .",
    "the dissipation factor @xmath63 affects the duration of the nucleation regime : the nucleation time @xmath235 as @xmath240 .",
    "once the nucleation regime is over , droplets quickly merge to form bi - continuous spatial domains and again the massive phase grows as @xmath162 for long times .     before concluding",
    ", we should discuss the relevance of these results for qcd phenomenology and experiments . in the context of heavy - ion collisions , given the uncertain values of dimensional quantities for quark matter ( e.g. , surface tension , dissipation ) , it is not clear whether the system equilibrates completely within the life - time of the fireball . if the system is almost equilibrated , the features of the coarsening morphology are similar for quenches through both first- and second - order lines in the phase diagram .",
    "however , if the equilibration time - scale is much larger than the fireball life - time , the morphology is very different for quenches through the first - order line , with the system evolving through nucleation of droplets .",
    "these signatures of a first - order transition are experimentally relevant because they imply the existence of a critical end point ( cep ) in the qcd phase diagram . as a matter of fact",
    ", experimental studies of such signatures may be more convenient than directly searching for the cep via critical fluctuations .",
    "to date , the latter approach has not provided conclusive evidence of the existence of a cep , presumably due to the smallness of the critical region .    * acknowledgements * + as thanks csir ( india ) for providing financial support",
