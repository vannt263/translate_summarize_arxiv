    "several submillimeter continuum features can be discerned .",
    "the two strongest peaks have been reported in our previous snapshot observations @xcite , while the weaker one is associated with the uc h region on  1 .",
    "since 0.85 mm continuum could arise from either dust or ionized gas , we estimate the dust contribution to the observed 0.85 mm flux density .",
    "first , we extrapolate the free - free emission as measured at cm wavelengths to 0.85 mm . as mentioned in ",
    "[ resultcont - vla ] , the turn - over frequency of the uc h region on  1 is around @xmath010 ghz , indicating a flux density ratio of @xmath00.76 between 0.85 mm and 1.3 cm calculating from a optically thin spectral index of @xmath30.1 .",
    "secondly , we convolve the 1.3 cm map to a gaussian beam of 0.74@xmath1@xmath60.54@xmath1 to match the angular resolution of the 0.85 mm map and regrid the convolved 1.3 cm map to have the same coordinate system as that of the 0.85 mm map .",
    "we then apply uniformly a scaling factor of 0.76 to all pixels in the regrided 1.3 cm image to obtain an extrapolated free - free image at 0.85 mm .",
    "finally the latter image is subtracted from the observed 0.85 mm map in order to obtain a continuum map without contribution of free - free emission , as shown in the _ right _ panel of figure [ fig - cont - sma ] .",
    "the 0.85 mm continuum shown in the _ right _ panel of figure [ fig - cont - sma ] is then presumably produced solely by dust in spite of the scaling factor 0.76 derived only from the uc h region on  1 ( i.e. , vla1 ) .",
    "the reasons are first vla2 is weaker and has negative spectral index ( inferred from 3.6 and 1.3 cm ) , thus its extrapolated ionized gas component at 0.85 mm should be negligible . secondly , we can show that the other sub - mm features can not be hypercompact ( hc ) h regions , since the turnover frequency of hc h regions is unlikely higher than @xmath0100 ghz .",
    "for example , for a hc h region with an emission measure of 1@xmath610@xmath32 , among the highest known value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the turn - over frequency is @xmath050 ghz only .",
    "thus for any hc h region weaker than 0.18 mjy ( i.e. , @xmath333@xmath34 rms noise levels ) at 22 ghz , its extrapolated free - free emission at 0.85 mm is also negligible , i.e. , @xmath33 1 mjy .",
    "the major difference between the two panels in figure  [ fig - cont - sma ] is caused by the contribution of free - free emission at 0.85 mm from the h region on  1 .",
    "as shown in the _ right _ panel of figure [ fig - cont - sma ] , after removing free - free contribution , the 0.85 mm dust image clearly exhibits a cavity surrounding the uc h region on  1 , and in total five dust sources ( denoted as sma1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , & 5 ) are further identified .",
    "the original sub - mm peak toward the h region on  1 is split into two sources ( i.e. , sma1 & sma3 ) . morphologically speaking , sma3 can be discerned as the extended feature associated with sma4 .",

    "thus probably vla3 and its associated water maser spots trace a blue - shifted outflow powered by a yso within the on  1 region .",

    "[ discuss - agb ] .",
    "similarly , sma5 does not exhibit any signposts of star formation either .",
    "one possible reason is that both sma4 and sma5 mark star formation regions at very early evolutionary stages .    in  [ resultcont - sma ] , we identified two dust sources , sma1 & sma3 , located to the north and southwest of the uc h region on  1 , after subtracting free - free emission from the 0.85-mm image .",

    "the so emission to the southwest of the on  1 is also likely associated with the sma1 , and the so gas to the northeast of the on  1 is likely associated with the sma3 .",
    "kinematically speaking , the velocity gradient of h@xmath9co@xmath10 ( 1@xmath30 ) along the northeast - southwest direction toward the h region on  1 has been reported by various authors , and is interpreted as either molecular outflows @xcite or a rotating dense core @xcite .",
    "a similar kinematics , which can be caused by molecular outflow , rotation of dense gas , and expansion of h region , is also seen in so and ch@xmath8oh lines with our sma observations .",
    "below , we re - examine these interpretations based on our high - spatial resolution results and discuss the nature of sma1 & sma3 .",
    "first , if the velocity structures seen in so and ch@xmath8oh result from molecular outflow , the most promising outflow driving source shown in our sma subarcsecond images is the same as the young star powering the uc h region on  1 . in this scenario",
    ", one will expect to identify signature of the ionized shell broken by the outflow activities .",
    "such a signature , however , can not be discerned from the cm - wave images shown in figure  [ fig - cont - vla ] .",
    "our results therefore do not appear to favor the interpretation of molecular outflow .",
    "the remaining two possibilities ( i.e. , expansion and rotation ) are not very easy to discriminate . with proper motion measurements , @xcite conclude that the motions of oh masers are consistent with the expansion of the uc h region on  1 .",
    "since both ch@xmath8oh and so emissions span similar velocity ranges with those measured in oh masers , and the kinematic structures of oh masers and ch@xmath8oh and so gas are similar , we suggest that the so and ch@xmath8oh gas associated with sma1 and sma3 trace the expansion of the h region .      similar to many other massive star formation regions , the on  1 region",
    "is also associated with an embedded star cluster identified at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that in the milky way about 70%@xmath390% stars are formed in clusters , and several fundamental properties of the galactic stellar population , such as the initial mass function ( imf ) , are forged in embedded star clusters ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe , = _ m@xmath44_/(__m@xmath45__+_m@xmath44 _ ) ) is a fundamental parameter of star and cluster formation processes , and appears to be an indicator for the evolution of an embedded cluster .",

    "we roughly evaluate the cluster mass from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "we first count the number of the stars detected within a radius of 60@xmath1 ( approximately a factor of two larger than the size of the molecular clump ) from the central h region on  1 , and in total 58 stars are found . assuming a mean mass of 0.5 _ _",

    "the relatively low sfe appears to suggest star formation in the on  1 region will continue .",
    "indeed , the identification of multiple centimeter and millimeter continuum sources toward on  1 region indicates an ongoing ( proto)cluster formation .",

    "m__@xmath2 ) in the sub - mm sources reported in ",
    "[ resultcont - sma ] , nevertheless , the sfe in on  1 region is still far from 30% .",
    "we propose three possibilities for the on  1 region if it would attain a high sfe of 30% as deduced for the more evolved young clusters .",
    "first is that there will be new cores and then stars forming later , second is that a significant fraction of the clump mass has to be accreted onto the existing dust sources , and/or third that a significant number of dust cores have been missed by our sma observations . for the second possibility , since cores keep accreting gas from clump , estimating final star mass from current core mass is difficult .",
    "thus one may expect a non - correlated relationship between star mass and core mass functions , as predicted by the competitive accretion model @xcite .    due to the lack of sufficient dynamical range , a proper identification of dust continuum sources with masses @xmath330.4 _",

    "if the core mass function exists at such a star formation scale , the lack of low - mass dust sources toward the cluster center infers a mass segregation , i.e. , massive cores preferentially located near cluster center , in the on  1 region . such core mass segregation is probably related to the stellar mass segregation often seen in young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although cs ( 7@xmath36 ) gas has been detected toward on  1 region with a peak flux density of @xmath0120 jy in a 20@xmath1 beam using single - dish telescopes @xcite , it is not detected at all with our sma observation in the image plane at a rms noise level of @xmath0100 mjy . to estimate the column density upper limit of the cs gas",

    "the inferred cs abundance will be increased if the adopted gas temperature is higher .",
    "for example , the upper - limit cs abundance will become ( 11@xmath32)@xmath610@xmath48 if assuming a gas temperature of 300 k. we conclude that the inferred cs abundance , at least for the more massive sub - mm sources such as sma4 , is likely much smaller than the typical cs abundance of 1@xmath610@xmath49 toward high - mass star - forming cores obtained from single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "with the same assumptions , similarly we estimate the hcn column density being @xmath33 2.0@xmath610@xmath9 and the abundance _",
    "x_(hcn ) @xmath33 ( 0.3@xmath32)@xmath610@xmath47 . in star forming cores , the typical _ x_(hcn ) is about a few @xmath610@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the direct interpretation of the non - detection of cs ( 7@xmath36 ) and low cs abundance is that there is indeed a depletion of cs in the inner region of the massive star forming core associated with on  1 , and the majority of the cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission detected by single - dish telescope should arise from an extended envelope .",
    "a proper explanation for the cs depletion is not easy .",
    "@xcite reported a cs depletion at the phase of starless cores , which might be able to explain the non - detection of cs ( 7@xmath36 ) gas at some dust condensations in the on  1 region . however , on  1 region appears to harbor ( some ) ysos which are more evolved than the pre - stellar - core phase .",
    "for example , sma2 is associated with masers of h@xmath7o and oh and cm - wave continuum , and sma1 exhibits strong ch@xmath8oh emission with @xmath42@xmath0300 k. both sma1 & sma2 are most likely evolved than the phase of pre - stellar core and their surrounding gas should be hot enough to evaporate cs from grain mantles to gas phase .",
    "an alternative situation is that the cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission from the outer envelope is optically thick , quite smoothly distributed and resolved out , one therefore can not see any embedded compact features spanning the same velocities .",
    "this is , however , unlikely the case for the on  1 region . as shown in figure [ fig - cs - hht ] , our single - dish observations with the 10-m smt indicate that the cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission toward on  1 region , with a main - beam temperature of @xmath04 _ k _ , is far from optically thick .",
    "moreover , that the line ratio of cs ( 7@xmath36 ) and c@xmath28s ( 7@xmath36 ) is very close to the @xmath50s/@xmath28s abundance ratio of @xmath022 @xcite also argues the optically thin cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission toward on  1 region .    although it is unlikely that the cs ( 7 - 6 ) emission is optically thick over the whole single - dish beam of @xmath022@xmath1 , we can not rule out the possibility that the cs ( 7@xmath36 ) of @xmath050@xmath3100 k is opaque within a region of @xmath05@xmath1 or so toward the on  1",
    "such conditions can still account for the non - detection of the cs ( 7@xmath36 ) in our sma observations .",
    "interferometric observations at 3@xmath35resolution , which can provide information to link the large - scale results from single - dish observations and the small - scale measurements with our sma observations presented here , should help to address this issue .",
    "one of the most dramatic results from maser observations toward on  1 region is the detection of extremely high - velocity h@xmath7o maser spots , with velocity @xmath0 @xmath51 @xmath52 km s@xmath18 , located approximately @xmath01.5@xmath1   to the east of the uc h region on  1 @xcite .",
    "such a velocity coverage is among the broadest range of h@xmath7o maser emission detected in ( high - mass ) star forming regions .",
    "in particular these extremely high - velocity masers spread into two small ( @xmath015 @xmath6 15 mas ) regions separated approximated 0.2@xmath1 along the east - west direction and display a clear velocity gradient , with blue spots to the east and red to the west @xcite .    together with proper motion measurements , @xcite",
    "suggest that these high - velocity h@xmath7o masers trace an outflow aligned roughly in the east - west direction driven by a yso in this region . the collimated jet seen in water masers , however ,",
    "is not centered on any sub - mm ( dust ) peak or molecular gas condensation traced by so and ch@xmath8oh . with the existence of a power - law correlation between _",
    "_ l__@xmath53 and _ _",
    "l__@xmath54 @xcite , the measured high water maser luminosity @xcite indicates a pumping source of luminous ( _ _ l__@xmath55 2@xmath610@xmath4 _ _ l__@xmath2 ) and massive yso unlikely to be missed with our sma observations . to our knowledge , furthermore , such an extremely high - velocity water maser system exhibiting a compact ( @xmath0300@xmath3400 au ) jet - like structure has never been detected in other star forming region .",
    "alternatively , stars at asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage can demonstrate maser activities of various species ( i.e. , h@xmath7o , oh , and sio ) ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "the velocities of masers detected in evolved stars usually span less than 40 km s@xmath18 , but extremely high - velocity ( @xmath0100 km s@xmath18 ) water masers have been detected toward approximately 10 evolved stars ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "these sources are the so - called `` water - fountain '' sources .",
    "they exhibit jet - like signatures in both kinematics and morphology , with extents of a few @xmath6 100 au and dynamical timescales of a few tens years .",
    "the origin of the high - velocity collimated jets around such agb stars is not well understood .",
    "one possible scenario is that the collimated jets are shaped by stellar magnetic field @xcite .    given the lack of identification of a young star to be responsible to power the water masers and the similarities in both morphology and kinematics of the h@xmath7o maser spots to the so - called `` water - fountain '' sources , we suspect that the collimated water jet toward on  1 region may be driven by an evolved star . if this is the case , it is interesting to know whether the water fountain jet as well as its driving source are really located within the massive star forming region on  1 or just along the line of sight .",
    "a precise estimate of the latter probability can not be done due to the lack of the sample statistics of water fountain jets .",
    "we consider that the probability of the latter is very small .",
    "given a similar systematic velocity of the on  1 region and the collimated water jet , a direct discriminate to this issue is not easy .",
    "a precise determination of the distance to the water fountain jet and the on  1 region by the annual parallax measurements with the vlbi will help to answer this question .",
    "we present results of interferometric observations toward the high - mass star formation region on  1 made with the sma and vla in continuum and molecular lines at subarcsecond resolutions .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "observations with the vla at both 1.3 cm and 3.6 cm identified two new cm - wave continuum sources in addition to the known uc h region on  1 .",
    "all the three cm - wave sources demonstrate maser activity .",
    "our sma observations identified five sub - mm dust sources within a field of @xmath05@xmath1 , indicating the multiplicity in the on  1 region .",
    "the dust and gas masses of these sub - mm sources are in the range of 0.8 to 6.4 _ _",
    "m__@xmath2 .",
    "sma2 exhibits several star formation signatures such as cm - wave emission ( i.e. , vla2 ) , h@xmath7o and oh maser activities , as well as so and ch@xmath8oh emission , and hence marks a newly identified star - forming core in the on  1 region . with an inferred far - ir bolometric luminosity of @xmath06000 _ _",
    "l__@xmath2 , sma2 represents an intermediate - mass or even high - mass star forming core .",
    "a low star formation efficiency of @xmath010% suggest that star formation in the on  1 region will continue .",
    "this is consistent with the identification of multiple yso candidates in the on  1 region .    \\6 .",
    "while strong cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission was detected toward the on  1 region with single - dish observations , it is not detected at all by our sma observations .",
    "the results of single - dish observations in cs ( 7@xmath36 ) and c@xmath28s ( 7@xmath36 ) rule out the possibility that the cs line was totally resolved out due to the smoothly distributed and optically thick cs emission from the extended envelope over the single - dish beam of 22@xmath1 .",
    "the non - detection of cs ( 7@xmath36 ) emission may imply a depletion of cs in the center of the on  1 region .",
    "there is a lack of identification of a young star to be responsible for powering the highly collimated high - velocity water jet identified in the on  1 region .",
    "we therefore suggest that these masers , like h@xmath7o maser spots in the so - called `` water - fountain '' sources , are driven by an evolved star .",
