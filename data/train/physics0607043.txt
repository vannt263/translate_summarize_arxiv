    "<S> we present a statistical analysis of time - resolved spontaneous emission decay curves from ensembles of emitters , such as semiconductor quantum dots , with the aim to interpret ubiquitous non - single - exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what is widely assumed , the density of excited emitters and the intensity in an emission decay curve are not proportional , but the density is a time - integral of the intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret non - single - exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the proper normalization for both a discrete , and a continuous distribution of rates , where every decay component is multiplied with its radiative decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> a central result of our paper is the derivation of the emission decay curve in case that both radiative and non - radiative decays are independently distributed . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the well - known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number anymore , but it is also distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a practical description of non - single - exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution of decay rates ; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of total decay rates weighted with the radiative rates . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our analysis to recent examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in photonic crystals , and we find that this important class of emitters is well described by a log - normal distribution of decay rates with a narrow and a broad distribution , respectively . finally , we briefly discuss the kohlrausch stretched - exponential model , and find that its normalization is ill - defined for emitters with a realistic quantum efficiency of less than 100 @xmath0 . </S>"
