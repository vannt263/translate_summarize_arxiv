    "the quantum hall effect  @xcite has remained one of the most important and outstanding laboratory systems where the instanton angle @xmath7 in asymptotically free field theory can be explored and investigated in great detail . as is well known , these topological ideas  @xcite originally arose in the attempt to reconcile von klitzing s experimental discovery  @xcite with the scaling theory of anderson localization  @xcite . from the experimental side",
    ", this theory set the stage for the observation of _ quantum criticality _ of the quantum hall plateau _ transitions _",
    "@xcite and this subject subsequently became an important research objective both in the laboratory  @xcite as well as on the computer  @xcite .",
    "from the theoretical side however , major gaps remained in our understanding of the conceptual structure of the problem .",
    "for example , it has only recently been demonstrated that the topological concept of an instanton vacuum quite generally displays _ robust _ topological quantum numbers that explain the precision and stability of the quantum hall plateaus  @xcite .",
    "this fundamental strong coupling feature of the theory had remained concealed for many years .",
    "the reason being that the very general aspect of the @xmath7 vacuum concept , the existence of _ massless chiral edge excitations _ , had historically not been recognized .",
    "the novel insight of massless edge excitations  @xcite has important consequences for longstanding controversies such as the _ quantization _ of topological charge , the existence of _ discrete _ topological sectors in the theory as well as the meaning of _ instantons _ and _ instanton gases _  @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of these issues has shown , for example , that the instanton vacuum of the grassmannian @xmath8 non - linear @xmath9 model in two dimensions quite _ generally _ displays the fundamental features of the quantum hall effect and not merely in the limit of zero number of field components @xmath10 ( _ replica limit _ ) alone .",
    "these fundamental or _ super universal _ features include    1 .   _ massless edge excitations _ that are otherwise well known to exist in quantum hall systems ; 2 .   _ robust _ quantization of the hall conductance ; 3 .",
    "_ gapless bulk excitations _ at @xmath11 that generally facilitate a _ transition _ to take place between adjacent quantum hall plateaus .",
    "this concept of _ super universality _ has in many ways been foreshadowed by the original papers on the subject .",
    "it however , clearly invalidates the many conflicting expectations and ideas on the @xmath7 parameter and in particular the historical papers  @xcite on the large @xmath1 expansion of the @xmath0 model  @xcite which is a special case of the grassmannian theory obtained by putting @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can now say that these historical papers have merely promoted the wrong physical ideas in the literature and served incorrect mathematical objectives .    in this paper we address a particularly delicate and fundamental issue , item ( iii ) above , about which there has been a great deal of confusion over many years .",
    "the root of this confusion are long standing claims which say that within the large @xmath1 expansion of the @xmath0 model `` the _ mass gap _ at @xmath11 remains _ finite _ ''",
    "@xcite , `` _ no _ critical exponents can be _ defined _ ''  @xcite etc . upon assuming that these claims are true , the statement of _ super universality _ of the quantum hall effect would obviously be incorrect and the theory would also not make much sense .",
    "for example , the fundamental lesson that quantum hall physics has taught us is that one generally can not disentwine the problem of _ quantum criticality _ at @xmath11 from the _ existence _ of the quantum hall plateaus .",
    "this simply means that one can not make any random statements about the _ transition _ at @xmath11 without having a detailed understanding of the _ quantization phenomenon _ itself .",
    "this lack of knowledge is the one of the reasons why it is always assumed incorrectly in the literature that the physics of the quantum hall effect is merely a feature of the theory in the replica limit alone  @xcite or , for that matter , the super symmetric extensions of the disordered free electron gas  @xcite .",
    "it has now been discovered  @xcite that the large @xmath1 expansion of the @xmath0 model displays all the _ super universal _ features of the quantum hall effect as listed under ( i ) - ( iii ) above , and also provides a lucid and exactly solvable example of the quantum hall _",
    "plateau transition_. for example , for the first time explicit _ finite size scaling _",
    "results for the physical observables ( `` conductances '' ) have been obtained and the expressions are found to be very similar to those observed experimentally .",
    "advances such as these are extremely important , especially since we are dealing with a theory where the information that can be extracted is very limited otherwise .",
    "even though the recent results  @xcite on finite size scaling have clearly demonstrated that a divergent correlation length exists at @xmath11 with an exponent equal to @xmath14 , they do not elucidate the _ nature _ of the massless excitations .",
    "for this purpose we develop , in this paper , a detailed _ critical theory _ of the large @xmath1 expansion , obtained by identifying the critical operators and their correlation functions . by presenting a complete theory that has freed itself from any historical controversies or preconceived mathematical biases",
    ", the authors essentially reestablish the original ideas on the subject , especially where it says that _ gapless _ excitations at @xmath11 are a generic topological feature of the instanton vacuum concept with the replica method only playing a role of secondary importance .",
    "@xcite    we start out , in section  [ secstart ] , from the coulomb gas representation of the large @xmath1 theory which corresponds to the geometry of a finite cylinder with radius @xmath15 and length @xmath16 . the appropriate objects to consider are the local charges of the coulomb gas that are controlled by a fugacity @xmath17 which is exponentially small in the linear dimension @xmath6 . in the language of the @xmath18 gauge theory , these correspond to polyakov lines which wind around the cylinder . by considering the limit of _ infinite _ cylinders ( i.e. @xmath19 and finite @xmath6 ) we recognize these local charges in terms of the bosonic",
    " quarks \" and  anti - quarks \" that appear in coleman s argument for periodicity in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "these particles have a vanishing string tension as @xmath7 passes through @xmath20 at which point it becomes energetically favorable for the system to materialize a quark anti - quark pair that moves in opposite directions toward  edges \" at spatial infinity .",
    "we identify the coulomb charges / coleman s quarks / polyakov lines in terms of _ critical operators _ of a one dimensional critical theory . based on an explicit knowledge of all multi - point correlation functions we are able to establish a one - to - one correspondence ( section  [ corr ] ) between the series expansion of the coulomb gas in powers of the fugacity @xmath17 on the one hand , and the low temperature series expansion of the @xmath4 ising model on the other .",
    "this correspondence immediately suggests that the transition at @xmath11 can be mapped onto none other than the @xmath4 ising model at low temperatures .",
    "this mapping is extremely helpful since the ising model , as is well known , is a prototypical example of a _ first order _ phase transition with a _ divergent _ correlation length @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the remaining of this paper is largely devoted to the details of the mapping of the large @xmath1 expansion onto exactly solvable models in one dimension .",
    "we shall benefit in particular from our introduction of a simple effective field theory in terms of _ massless chiral fermions _ that elegantly displays the complete operator structure of the theory as well as an underlying orthogonal symmetry ( section  [ chiralf ] ) .",
    "this theory has previously emerged as the theory of _ massless chiral edge excitations _ in quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "having identified a complete critical theory for the transition at @xmath11 we next wish to use our results in order to obtain exact expressions for the physical observables ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) which define the scaling behavior of the theory in two dimensions with varying linear dimensions @xmath24 . by the phrase  exact \" we mean",
    "that our mapping procedure facilitates a resummation to all orders in the fugacity @xmath17 of the coulomb gas . for this purpose",
    "we investigate finite size ising spin chains and chiral fermions with a linear dimension @xmath16 . in section  [ finite ]",
    "we obtain expressions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 in terms of ising model and chiral fermion correlations which are some of the most important results of this paper . in section  [ rgln ] , finally , we study the consequences of our results in terms of the renormalization group .",
    "we end this paper with a conclusion in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the action of the @xmath0 model on a finite cylinder is @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "we define the theory with the fields satisfying periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath27 direction and _ free boundary conditions _ at @xmath28 .    to motivate this choice of boundary conditions",
    ", we note that the theory on a finite cylinder can be thought of in different physical situations .",
    "firstly , in the context of the low energy dynamics of disordered electron gas in strong magnetic fields with @xmath29 denoting the mean field value of the hall conductance or , equivalently , the filling fraction of the landau bands .",
    "it also describes the long wavelength behaviour of a dimerised @xmath30 quantum spin chain at temperature @xmath31 where @xmath29 is related to the degree of dimerisation .",
    "finally , it can be thought of as the finite temperature theory of @xmath1 charged relativistic scalar particles in one spatial dimension , strongly interacting with @xmath18 gauge fields and in the presence of a background electric field proportional to @xmath29 .    in the case of the electronic system",
    ", it is well known that edge currents exist and that they are crucial to the phenomenon of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the spin chain has dangling spins at the edges which are the low energy degrees of freedom in the strongly dimerised limit . in the context of scalar electrodynamics ,",
    "coleman s picture @xcite leads us to expect charged degrees of freedom ( `` quarks '' and `` anti quarks '' ) at the edges . thus in all the three cases",
    ", we have reason to expect that the fluctuations of the fields at the boundary play an important role in the physics .",
    "in what follows we shall hardly distinguish between these three different physical interpretations of the theory and frequently make use of any one of them , wherever it is convenient .",
    "in previous papers we have introduced @xmath4 sine - gordon model or coulomb gas representation for the large @xmath1 expansion of the @xmath0 model that effectively describes the @xmath7 dependence for a finite two dimensional cylindrical geometry with edges  @xcite . even though ideas very similar to ours have been proposed a long time ago  @xcite ,",
    "the most fundamental aspects of the problem have nevertheless been overlooked and the exact meaning of the coulomb gas representation has therefore not been understood until recently .",
    "we shall proceed by recalling the main features of the theory as it now stands .",

    "from the results of this section it is clear that the identification of eqs and with the quantum hall state is solely based on the edge parts of the theory @xmath109 that describe the well known edge currents in the problem .",
    "these subtleties of the edges have historically not been recognized , however .",
    "a _ transition _ takes place between the adjacent quantum hall states , labelled by the integers @xmath98 and @xmath111 , at the exact values @xmath112 which in the language of the electron gas corresponds to half - integer filling fractions . notice that in the limit where @xmath100 tends to infinity this _ plateau _ transition is infinitely sharp .",
    "similarly , from eq we conclude that , in the same limit , the free energy of the bulk @xmath113 develops a cusp at @xmath114 according to @xmath115 indicating that the transition is a _ first order _ one .",
    "next , to develop a better understanding of the _ nature _ of the plateau transitions we evaluate the expression for the partition function eqs   and for @xmath7 close to an odd multiple of @xmath20 .",

    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first of all , the result of eq . indicates that the plateau transition is described in terms of an admixture of three distinctly different _ phases _ with a well defined _ probability",
    "_ @xmath120 each .",
    "these phases are labelled by an exponential factor @xmath138 with @xmath139 taking on the values @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively . the quantity @xmath142 in eq .",
    "can be interpreted as the _ probability _ of finding the system in the _ dissipative _ or _ critical _ phase labelled by @xmath143 . in the same way",
    ", @xmath144 denotes the _ probability _ of finding the system in the @xmath145 vacuum or @xmath146 quantum hall phase .",
    "similarly , @xmath147 is the probability of finding the system in the @xmath148 vacuum or @xmath116 quantum hall phase . as we shall see in the analysis that follows , correlation functions of the theory display exactly the same general structure as that of eqs - .",
    "secondly , it should be mentioned that the result of eq .",
    "determines not only the  ensemble averaged \" conductances @xmath123 and @xmath124 but also the complete statistics of conductance _ distributions _  @xcite .",
    "for example , expressing eq . in the exponential form of eq .",
    "then we directly see that besides the lowest order terms in @xmath149 and @xmath150 we actually have an infinite series of higher order moments .",
    "these higher order moments can all be expressed in terms of the  ensemble averaged \" quantities @xmath132 and @xmath135 , however , and it suffices to limit the analysis to the  ensemble averaged \" quantities alone .",
    "thirdly , in spite of the rich structure that emerges , it is important to keep in mind that we have considered the coulomb gas to lowest order in an expansion in powers of the fugacity @xmath17 only .",
    "even though the expressions in eqs   - are generally well defined in the limit @xmath151 , they nevertheless show that the expansion in the fugacity @xmath17 actually diverges at @xmath11 in the limit where @xmath16 is taken to infinity first .",
    "this complication in defining the thermodynamic limit clearly indicates that the higher order terms in the expansion are important",
    ". this will be the main subject of section [ finite ] where we make use of the mapping onto the ising model and chiral fermion theory in order to be able to re - sum the series in the fugacity @xmath17 to infinite order .     and",
    "@xmath152 conductance plane according to eqs - , see text.,width=453 ]",
    "to develop a theory for gapless excitations at @xmath11 we next embark on the subject of correlation functions .",
    "we are specifically interested in the finite temperature correlation function of the coulomb gas @xmath153 which corresponds to a pair of static charges or a quark anti - quark pair at positions @xmath77 and @xmath76 respectively . in the limit of zero fugacity ( @xmath154 )",

    "as discussed in the previous section , this limit precisely corresponds to the situation where the naive expansion in powers of the fugacity @xmath17 gets complicated . to deal with these complications",
    "we shall proceed and obtain , in the remaining parts of this section , expressions for arbitrary multi point correlation functions of the coulomb gas .",
    "these expressions then serve as a starting point in section  [ isingmodel ] for the mapping of the coulomb gas problem onto exactly solvable models in one dimension .",
    "first , let @xmath7 approach @xmath20 from below .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "is then dominated by the term with @xmath159 and we can write @xmath160 here , @xmath161 denotes the heaviside step function . on the other hand , when @xmath7 approaches @xmath20 from above the sum is dominated by the @xmath12 term and the result is @xmath162 in the limit of large separations",
    "one may replace the correlation function @xmath163 by its long ranged part which will be denoted by @xmath164 @xmath165 eqs and describe the mechanism that , following coleman , is responsible for adding / removing charges at the edges at infinity when @xmath7 passes through @xmath20 .",

    "this picture is consistent with the result of eq . which says that when @xmath7 passes through @xmath20 from _ above _ , the pair correlation is dominated by the @xmath12 vacuum which means that a quark and an anti - quark are present at the edges at infinity .    coleman s picture is strictly valid for the coulomb gas with a vanishing fugacity ( or @xmath167 ) only and the physical processes associated with finite values of @xmath17 or @xmath6 are by no means obvious .",
    "nevertheless , it is extremely important to recognize that coleman s picture is in fact synonymous for having _ massless _ excitations at @xmath11 .",

    "the fundamental features of the quantum hall effect are therefore not merely a topic of replica field theory or disordered free electron systems alone . rather than that , they are a _ super universal _ phenomenon that teaches us something fundamental about instanton vacuum in asymptotically free field theory in general .    as a final remark",
    ", it should be mentioned that the statement of _ super universality _ has recently been investigated and studied , with great success , in several completely different physical systems such as the theory in the presence of electron - electron interactions ,  @xcite quantum spin chains  @xcite as well as the ambegaokar - eckern - schn theory of the coulomb blockade problem  @xcite .",
