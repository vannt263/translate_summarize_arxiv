    "the optical spectra of nls1s are characterized by narrow balmer lines , strong fe  ii@xmath04570 and weak [ o  iii]@xmath05007 ( hereafter [ o  iii ] ) emission . here",
    "we study the uv spectra of nls1s .",
    "our sample consists of 9 nls1s for which uv spectra were available ( as of dec .",
    "1998 ) either from the hst or iue archives .",
    "we found that the nls1s have narrower uv lines than typical broad - line agn such as seyfert  1 ( sy1 ) galaxies and quasars .",
    "the comparison of the equivalent widths of the prominent uv lines in nls1s showed that the distribution of ly@xmath2 equivalent widths does not differ from typical agn , while the equivalent widths of civ are significantly lower .",
    "-2.5 in 2.9 in    the ciii]@xmath01909/ly@xmath2 and civ / ly@xmath2 line ratios are smaller ( see fig .  1 ) and the siiii]@xmath01892/ciii ] and siiv+oiv]@xmath01400/civ ratios are larger when compared to typical agn . to find what broad - line emitting cloud parameters produce such line ratios , we have calculated these ratios using the ionization code _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1991 ) for different densities and ionization parameters , using as an input ionizing continuum the spectral energy distribution of one of our nls1s .",
    "an example of such a calculation for the civ / ly@xmath2 ratio is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in order to produce the line ratios observed in nls1s , 10 times lower an ionization parameter ( @xmath3 ) and densities up to 10 times larger ( 10@xmath4  @xmath5 to 10@xmath6  @xmath5 for civ , ly@xmath2 , siiv emitting clouds and @xmath7  @xmath5 to 10@xmath8  @xmath5 for the siiii ] , ciii ] clouds ) than standard are needed ( where the standard blr parameters are @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xmath5 for the civ , ly@xmath2 emitting region and @xmath7  @xmath5 for the siiii ] , ciii ] region ) .",
    "it is known ( e.g. puchnarewicz et al . 1995 ; boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) that the big blue bumps ( bbbs ) in nls1s are shifted towards higher energies compared to other agn .",
    "it has been suggested ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; wandel 1997 ) , based on the analogy with the galactic black hole candidates , that these hotter bbbs may be due to higher ratios of the luminosity to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath1 ) , meaning that nls1s have systematically lower masses at a given luminosity range than other agn .",
    "we investigate this suggestion by calculating the central engine parameters with the accretion disk and corona model of witt , czerny & ycki ( 1997 ) and fitting it to the optical / uv / x - ray continua of nls1s .",
    "the model is fully defined by : the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath1 and the viscosity parameter ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we found that :    * @xmath1 is higher ( @xmath13 ) in nls1s than in typical agn ( @xmath14 0.3 ) * nls1s have 10100 @xmath15 lower @xmath11 than agn with comparable luminosity * bolometric luminosity of nls1s is comparable to qsos rather than sy1s .",
    "the higher @xmath1 ratios result in hotter bbbs observed in nls1s . in the context of the two - phase model of krolik & kallman ( 1988 ) , where the cool phase represents the blr clouds and the hot phase represents the intercloud confining medium",
    ", the hotter bbbs change the equilibrium between the two phases .",
    "this results in higher blr cloud densities and hence the characteristic , observed uv emission - line properties of nls1s .",
    "it has also been suggested that another parameter , orientation , may be responsible for the observed emission - line properties .",
    "boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) performed a principal component analysis on the line / continuum correlation matrix of the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) sample and showed that the primary eigenvector ( hereafter ev1 ) , was anticorrelated with various measures of fe  ii@xmath16 strength , correlated with [ o  iii ] strength ( luminosity and peak ) and h@xmath17 fwhm , and anticorrelated with the blue asymmetry of the h@xmath17 line .",
    "it was later found that these optical line properties correlate with uv line properties and x - ray continuum properties .",
    "nls1s , as objects with strong fe  ii and weak [ o  iii ] emission , have the most negative values of ev1 .    bg92 and boroson ( 1992 ) argued that ev1 is not driven by an orientation effect ( i.e. some anisotropic property ) as it is strongly correlated with the [ o  iii ] luminosity , which was assumed to be isotropic .",
    "however , the isotropy of the [ o  iii ] emission in other agn has since been called into question .",
    "some results based on radio - loud samples ( jackson & browne 1990 ; baker 1997 ) suggest that the inner regions of [ o  iii ] emission extend to sufficiently small radii to be obscured by the dusty torus when the active nucleus is viewed edge - on . on the other hand , [ o  ii]@xmath03727 emission , which has a lower critical density and ionization potential , lies further out and should not be affected by the torus ( he s , barthel & fosbury 1996 ) .",
    "hence we present an investigation of the relation between [ o  ii ] emission and ev1 , which will enable us to find whether ev1 is dependent on orientation . finding a strong relation between ev1 and [ o  ii ] luminosity would imply that ev1 is independent of orientation , while the lack of such a relation would suggest that orientation is a factor .",
    "we have chosen radio - quiet quasars from the optically selected bright quasar survey ( bqs ) from the bg92 sample covering a wide range of ev1 values .",
    "we have subtracted from our spectra the fe  ii emission , which contaminates the [ o  iii ] emission , and we have accounted for the presence of the small blue bump ( balmer continuum and fe  ii emission ) at the [ o  ii ] wavelengths .",
    "we found strong correlations between l([o  ii ] ) , l([o  iii ] ) and ev1 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , implying that ev1 does not depend on orientation , confirming earlier conclusions of bg92 and boroson ( 1992 ) , based on [ o  iii ] alone .",
    "it also suggests that both [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission does not depend on orientation in bqs radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this also implies that nls1s , which lie at extreme ev1 values , are not viewed from an extreme viewing angle .    99 baker , j. c. 1997 , mnras , 286 , 2 boller , th . ,",
