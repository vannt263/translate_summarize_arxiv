    "heusler compounds @xcite attract ever - growing experimental and theoretical attention , largely because a vast number of such compounds have been predicted to be half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf ) , i.e. , the compounds behave like a metal for one spin channel and like a semiconductor for the other.@xcite peculiar electronic transport properties are expected from such materials , e.g. , huge magnetoresistive effects in giant and tunnel magnetoresistive ( gmr , tmr ) devices .",
    "heusler compounds are ternary intermetallic compounds with the general chemical formula @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are transition - metal atoms and @xmath5 is a main group element .",
    "they form the cubic l2@xmath6 structure ( space group fm@xmath7 m ) with a four atom basis . the half - metals among the heusler compounds follow the slater - pauling rule , which connects the magnetic moment per formula unit @xmath8 and the number of valence electrons @xmath9 via @xcite @xmath10    most theoretical studies of these materials have been based on density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) in the kohn - sham formalism so far,@xcite which gives access to ground - state properties , such as the total energy , atomic forces , magnetic moments etc .",
    "it relies on a mapping of the real system onto a fictitious system of noninteracting electrons moving in an effective potential .",
    "the half - metallic nature found experimentally for some heusler compounds is predicted correctly by dft , together with a quantitative explanation of the slater - pauling behavior .",
    "however , it is questionable whether the kohn - sham eigenvalue spectrum can be taken as the excitation spectrum of the real system . strictly speaking",
    ", there is no theoretical justification for such an interpretation .",
    "in fact , while the band structure often resembles the experimentally determined dispersions remarkably well , there are important quantitative discrepancies . for example , the fundamental band gaps of semiconductors and insulators are usually underestimated by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "this raises the question if the half - metal band gap is also subject to this underestimation .",
    "studies on co@xmath0mnsi indicate that this is not so : the experimental gap is not larger than about 1ev as inferred from tunnel spectroscopy and x - ray absorption experiments.@xcite this value is very close to the calculated kohn - sham gap .",
    "the bandwidth of metals and the exchange splitting of ferromagnets are two other important spectral quantities which are often unsatisfactorily described by kohn - sham dft.@xcite    there are several approaches that allow to go beyond kohn - sham dft in this respect .",
    "for example , dft@xmath11 and dft+dmft ( dynamical mean field theory in a correlated subspace ) employ an effective , partially screened interaction parameter , the hubbard @xmath12 parameter , that acts between electrons in the subspace of localized states while the rest is treated on the level of dft.@xcite the @xmath12 parameter itself is taken in its static limit .",
    "dynamical screening effects of the itinerant electrons are thus neglected .",
    "furthermore , the hubbard @xmath12 parameter is usually taken as an empirical parameter that is fitted to experiment , and the artificial separation into localized and itinerant electrons requires a double - counting correction , which is not uniquely defined .",
    "lda+dmft calculations on half - metals suggest the presence of nonquasiparticle states inside the half - metal gap , which may destroy the half - metallic character of a material.@xcite    another method that allows to obtain physical electron addition and removal energies is the @xmath1 approximation for the electronic self - energy within many - body perturbation theory.@xcite in contrast to dft , the @xmath1 method is designed for spectral properties , such as the band structure .",
    "typically , it opens the gap of semiconductors and insulators and gives good agreement with experiments .",
    "we apply this method to co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi , two prototypical and potentially half - metallic heusler compounds , to study the effect of many - body corrections on their band structures . in particular , we will answer the question if the @xmath1 approximation increases the half - metal band gap as in the case of semiconductors and insulators or not . as already mentioned above , an increase may worsen the good agreement to experiment achieved by kohn - sham dft .",
    "co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi are particularly interesting because of their large magnetic moments and curie temperatures .",
    "they are known to form the l2@xmath6 structure with a low degree of chemical disorder;@xcite this allows accurate comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "the half - metallic character and integer magnetic moment of co@xmath0mnsi is already predicted by dft.@xcite for co@xmath0fesi , dft calculations predict a significantly reduced magnetic moment with respect to experiment and the slater - pauling value.@xcite dft@xmath11 and dft+dmft find a magnetic moment in accordance with the slater - pauling rule and experiment with @xmath12 parameters of 1.8 and 3ev , respectively.@xcite however , dft@xmath11 deteriorates the spectral properties of co@xmath0fesi compared to conventional dft calculations.@xcite it is the aim of this work to investigate to which extent many - body corrections within the @xmath1 method modify or confirm the predictions made by dft calculations and , in particular , whether the @xmath1 approximation is able to rectify the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi without deteriorating the spectral properties .",
    "in this work we present one - shot @xmath1 calculations , which yield the quasiparticle energies @xmath13 as corrections on the kohn - sham energies @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the kohn - sham wavefunctions and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the band index , bloch vector , and electron spin , respectively .",
    "the quasiparticle correction contains the exchange - correlation potential @xmath20 , for which we employ the pbe functional,@xcite and the @xmath1 self - energy operator , which is given in formal notation by @xmath21,@xcite where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the kohn - sham green function and screened coulomb potential , respectively .",
    "the latter is approximated by the random - phase approximation @xmath24 with the polarization function @xmath25 and the bare coulomb interaction @xmath26 .",
    "notably , @xmath23 does not depend on spin : quasiparticles of both spin directions interact via the same screened potential .",
    "we use the fleur @xcite and spex @xcite programs for the dft and @xmath1 calculations , respectively .",
    "these codes are based on the highly precise all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method .",
    "transition - metal 3__s _ _",
    ", 3__p _ _ and si 2__s _ _ , 2__p _ _ semicore states are treated with local orbitals , although their effect on the spectra is small .",
    "the muffin - tin radii are set to 2.25 and 2.31bohr for the transition - metal atoms and si , respectively .",
    "we employ plane - wave and angular momentum cutoff parameters of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the dft calculations are performed on 256 @xmath18 points in the irreducible wedge to obtain a reliable starting point .",
    "the @xmath1 calculations are performed with a @xmath29 @xmath18-point mesh that contains 47 points in the irreducible wedge with cutoff parameters for the mixed product basis @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and an additional cutoff @xmath32 for the correlation part of the self - energy ; see ref .   for details .",
    "we find that 50 empty bands are sufficient to converge the quasiparticle spectra to better than 0.05ev .",
    "this is also the estimated accuracy of the @xmath18-point sampling .",
    "the self - energy is evaluated with a contour integration in the complex frequency plane , and eq .",
    "[ qpe ] , which is nonlinear in energy , is solved on an energy mesh with spline interpolation between the points .",
    "the densities of states ( dos ) curves are obtained with tetrahedron integration and convoluted with a gaussian of 0.1ev full - width at half - maximum .",
    "binding energies are always taken relative to the corresponding fermi energy , which is determined by the condition that the dos integrates to the total number of electrons from @xmath33 to the fermi energy .",
    "all calculations are based on the experimental lattice constant of 5.64 for both compounds.@xcite",

    "additionally , the exchange splitting of these states is reduced .",

    "d _ states of co@xmath0mnsi remain largely unchanged . while the absolute values of the 3__d _ _ quasiparticle energies do change due to the exactly cancelled self - interaction error , the fermi energy changes likewise so that the difference remains more or less the same . close to the fermi energy",
    "we find a small increase of the exchange splitting by 0.2ev in co@xmath0mnsi , which places the @xmath1 fermi energy closer to the minority valence band minimum .",
    "in addition , the minority gap ( given by the @xmath39 transition ) is slightly enhanced from 0.82ev to 0.95ev , and the unoccupied minority _",
    "states are rigidly pushed up in energy .",
    "the only small quasiparticle correction of the minority gap is noteworthy in view of the fact that semiconductor and insulator gaps usually increase considerably ( and rightly so ) when treated within the @xmath1 approximation .",
    "thus , the apprehension that @xmath1 might worsen the agreement with experiment is proved wrong with this result .",
    "this aspect will be analyzed in more detail in the next section .",
    "a similar effect is encountered for co@xmath0fesi , but the increase of the exchange splitting and the shift of the unoccupied _ d _ states are larger than in co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "this places the fermi energy in the middle of a minority pseudogap , which accommodates a light band of fe @xmath40 character .",
    "quasiparticle shifts as function of the kohn - sham energy.,width=325 ]    the quasiparticle shifts are displayed in fig .",
    "we see that the _ d _ states are pushed up in energy ; the occupied states move closer to @xmath41 and the unoccupied states away from it .",
    "also the increase of the exchange splitting around the fermi energy becomes visible .",
    "for co@xmath0fesi , the states close to the kohn - sham fermi energy are pushed up in energy by as much as 0.85ev .",
    "these are mostly of fe _ d _ character with 25 - 50% admixture of co _ d _ character .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] compares the magnetic moments , the minority @xmath42 and @xmath39 transition energies , and the minority spin flip gaps from the kohn - sham and quasiparticle calculations and from experiments .",
    "the magnetic moment of co@xmath0mnsi is the same in pbe and @xmath1 and matches the experimental value very well.@xcite with the fermi energy located in the pseudogap , the magnetic moment of co@xmath0fesi is increased from 5.52@xmath43/f.u . to 5.89@xmath43/f.u .",
    ", improving the agreement with the experimental value of 5.97@xmath43/f.u .",
    "considerably.@xcite hence , the one - shot @xmath1 approach manages to correct the magnetic moment .",
    "we note that the orbital magnetic moment @xcite is not taken into account in our calculations .    the minority spin flip gap , i.e. , the energy required to promote an electron from the minority valence band maximum to a majority state at the fermi energy , is nonzero for co@xmath0mnsi but zero for co@xmath0fesi due to the minority pseudogap . from tunnel spectroscopy of magnetic tunnel junctions one",

    "the shapes of the spectra agree with the computed dos ; also , the alignments with the fermi energy seem reasonable , and the hybridizations are visible in spite of the large lifetime broadening of the spectra . for a detailed comparison of the energy levels one would have to take into account the interaction of the core hole with the photoelectron , i.e. , an exciton .",
    "this effect is of the order of @xmath55ev , and it affects the final states in dependence on their symmetry and localization.@xcite a consistent treatment of the optical absorption process would require solving the bethe - salpeter equation.@xcite kallmayer  _ et al .",
    "_  have taken the exciton binding energy as 0.5ev and assumed the exciton to effect a rigid shift of the unoccupied _ d _ states towards the fermi level . with these assumptions , they find that the maximum dos of co should be at 0.9ev and 0.6ev above @xmath41 for co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi , respectively.@xcite these values agree with our calculated @xmath1 values within 0.1ev , while the kohn - sham spectrum shows a larger discrepancy , see fig .

    "the unoccupied minority @xmath56 states of co@xmath0fesi are mostly shifted rigidly upwards in the @xmath1 calculation .",
    "it was recently shown , that x - ray magnetic linear dichroism spectra of co@xmath0fesi can be described by a dft calculation with the pbe functional plus a rigid shift of the @xmath56 states.@xcite we conclude that the spectrum of unoccupied states is described correctly within the @xmath1 approximation .",
    "in the @xmath1 approximation , the screened coulomb interaction @xmath57 is the key ingredient .",
    "intuitively , one may expect that the similarity of the pbe and @xmath1 results arises from the metallic screening of the majority spin channel . to test this conjecture ,",
    "we have computed the @xmath1 gap of co@xmath0mnsi without metallic screening .",
    "we also analyze the importance of local - field effects and briefly discuss results from a one - shot pbe0 hybrid functional scheme.@xcite    neglecting screening altogether , i.e. , replacing @xmath23 by the bare coulomb interaction @xmath26 , we obtain the ( non - selfconsistent ) hartree - fock gap of 9.65 ev , a gross overestimation .",
    "now we allow for screening effects but suppress the metallic screening .",
    "we achieve this by replacing polarization contributions from the majority spin channel , where metallic screening takes place , by the polarization arising from the minority spin electrons , i.e , we use @xmath58 .",
    "this enforces a long - range @xmath23 also in the static limit , since the electrons can not flow freely in the gapped minority channel , which would enable them to screen test charges completely . employing this artificial semiconductor - like polarization , which exhibits a finite dielectric constant of @xmath59",
    ", we obtain only a slightly larger minority energy gap of 0.97ev . on the other hand",
    ", setting @xmath60 reduces the gap to 0.86ev .",
    "clearly , the majority electrons generate a more effective screening , but the differences in the gap values are relatively small .",
    "long - range metallic screening does not seem to contribute significantly to the total screening , and screening taking place at short distances seems to be more effective .    to investigate this further",
    ", we exclude local - field effects .",
    "local - field effects arise from density fluctuations of a different wave length than their generating fields .",
    "these couplings are related to the offdiagonal elements of the polarization matrix @xmath61 represented in a plane - wave basis .",
    "( we employ , instead , a basis of eigenvectors of the coulomb matrix represented in the mixed product basis , which are , however , reasonably close to plane waves . ) setting these offdiagonal elements to zero implies that the screened interaction @xmath57 only depends on the difference @xmath62 rather than on the absolute positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the charge density within the unit cell and its screening are homogeneous.@xcite the resulting energy gap of 1.65ev is nearly twice as large as the kohn - sham value . also , the low - lying _ s _ and _ p - d _ states are affected significantly : they shift by about 0.5ev upwards in energy with respect to the pbe result , at odds with experiment . furthermore , the exchange splitting of the occupied _",
    "d _ states increases and the minority spin - flip gap vanishes .",
    "thus , the charge inhomogeneity plays a crucial role for the screening properties .",
    "we note , that damewood and fong found similarly small changes of the half - metallic gaps of zincblende cras , mnas , and mnc in the @xmath1 approximation with respect to pbe calculations , and a similar behaviour of the gap size with respect to the local - field effects.@xcite    in recent years , potentials derived from hybrid functionals , e.g. , pbe0,@xcite have often been used as an approximation to the electronic self - energy .",
    "being nonlocal they fulfill an important condition of the self - energy .",
    "hybrid functionals have been shown to overcome the typical underestimation of band gaps within kohn - sham dft .",
    "however , dynamical effects are not taken into account , and screening is only considered in an average way by the parameter that mixes the nonlocal and local parts . in the pbe0 functional this mixing parameter",
    "is universally taken to be 0.25.@xcite since the @xmath1 approximation contains the bare exchange exactly , we can easily calculate a one - shot ( non - selfconsistent ) pbe0 energy spectrum .",
    "we find that while pbe0 gives similar results for the binding energies of the low - lying _ s _ and _ p - d _ states as the @xmath1 approximation , it completely fails in determining the minority gap , for which it yields 3.03ev .",
    "also , the exchange splitting is strongly overestimated in both cases .",
    "thus , only a dynamical self - energy can simultaneously describe states close to the fermi energy and far away equally well .",
    "we have presented one - shot @xmath1 calculations of the ( potentially ) half - metallic heusler compounds co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi .",
    "the @xmath1 quasiparticle spectra are qualitatively similar to the kohn - sham eigenvalue spectra , but show important quantitative differences . in particular",
    ", the @xmath1 approximation predicts an electronic structure with a minority pseudogap in the case of co@xmath0fesi , which corrects the magnetic moment per unit cell to nearly an integral number , consistent with available experimental data .",
    "the quasiparticle spectra are in good agreement with photoemission and x - ray absorption data for both compounds .",
    "the electronic screening is effective at short distances and charge inhomogeneities play an important role for the screening .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the pbe0 hybrid potential can not be used as an approximate self - energy : it even yields worse results than the local pbe potential .",
    "so far , most theoretical studies of heusler compounds have been based on the kohn - sham band structure . in this work",
    ", we have demonstrated that it can , in fact , represent a reasonable approximation to the many - body quasiparticle spectrum , which confirms previous successful calculations of spectral properties of heusler compounds within dft .",

    "<S> quasiparticle spectra of potentially half - metallic co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi heusler compounds have been calculated within the one - shot @xmath1 approximation in an all - electron framework without adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for co@xmath0fesi the many - body corrections are crucial : a pseudogap opens and good agreement of the magnetic moment with experiment is obtained . otherwise , however , the changes with respect to the density - functional - theory starting point are moderate . for both cases </S>",
    "<S> we find that photoemission and x - ray absorption spectra are well described by the calculations . by comparison with the @xmath1 density of states , we conclude that the kohn - sham eigenvalue spectrum provides a reasonable approximation for the quasiparticle spectrum of the heusler compounds considered in this work . </S>"
