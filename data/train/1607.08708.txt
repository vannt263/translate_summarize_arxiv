    "<S> we have used inelastic neutron scattering to measure the magnetic excitation spectrum along the high - symmetry directions of the first brillouin zone of the magnetic skyrmion hosting compound @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of our scattering data are consistent with the expectations of a recently proposed model for the magnetic excitations in @xmath0 , and we report best - fit parameters for the dominant exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> important differences exist , however , between our experimental findings and the model expectations . </S>",
    "<S> these include the identification of two energy scales that likely arise due to neglected anisotropic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of our work suggests that anisotropy should be considered in future theoretical work aimed at the full microscopic understanding of the emergence of the skyrmion state in this material .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic skyrmions are topologically non - trivial spin structures that can extend over tens of nanometers @xcite . in certain magnetic compounds with non - centrosymmetric crystal structure </S>",
    "<S> they can condense and form a regular hexagonal arrangement as observed in the metallic helimagnets mnsi @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite , fege @xcite , and coznmn @xcite , insulating @xmath0 @xcite , and in the polar magnetic semiconductor @xmath2 @xcite . to understand the formation and the microscopic origin of these skyrmion phases one needs a multi - scale approach that covers the macroscopic domain of the skyrmion as well as the quantum scale of the local spins . </S>",
    "<S> this however breaks down in the above mentioned metals , because the low energy delocalized electrons and magnetic degrees of freedom are mixed , intrinsically involving multiple energy and spatial scales .    among cubic helimagnets </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the only insulator with magnetoelectric properties in the ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it offers an ideal laboratory to explore the microscopic ingredients that lead to skyrmion formation in a quantitative manner , since its bloch - type ground state properties and low energy excitations are fully governed by the magnetic interactions between localized spins and are not affected by the presence of itinerant carriers . </S>",
    "<S> exchange pathway considerations , susceptibility measurements , and _ ab initio _ calculations reveal that two magnetic energy scales divide the system into weakly coupled @xmath3 tetrahedra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath3 `` molecules '' , with an effective spin of @xmath4 , are the elementary magnetic building blocks of @xmath0 instead of the single cu ions . </S>",
    "<S> the effective spins of the @xmath3 tetrahedra are ferromagnetically coupled and form a trillium lattice just as the mn and fe ions do in the b20 structure of the metallic skyrmion compounds mnsi and fege .    </S>",
    "<S> prior to the undertaking of the present work , previous studies of the magnetic excitation spectra of @xmath0 were conducted using raman scattering @xcite and microwave resonance absorption @xcite ; techniques that are sensitive only to excitations in the center of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is able to measure at finite momentum transfer and is therefore uniquely suited to probe the magnetic excitation spectra of @xmath0 throughout reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> the additional information afforded by ins therefore provides more rigorous tests of theoretical models aimed at describing the excitation spectra of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of @xmath0 ( cubic @xmath5 space group , @xmath6  ) were grown via chemical vapor transport as described elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three @xmath0 single crystals of @xmath7 g total mass were coaligned with @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] in the horizontal scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic properties of each individual crystal were verified by magnetization measurements , and subsequent neutron diffraction confirmed that the mosaic sample displayed a transition temperature between magnetically ordered and disordered states at @xmath10  k , consistent with previous reports @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ins measurements were performed at the thermal triple - axis neutron spectrometer eiger and the cold triple - axis neutron spectrometer tasp , both located at the swiss spallation neutron source ( sinq ) , paul scherrer institut , switzerland . </S>",
    "<S> the sample mosaic was installed into a standard orange cryostat which provided a base temperature of @xmath11  k. inelastic scans were performed in constant-@xmath12 mode , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 at eiger and @xmath16 @xmath15 at tasp , for @xmath17 points along the line around several @xmath18 points .     as a function of energy transfer , along the line [ @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> scans in panel ( a ) were measured at @xmath22 k , above @xmath23 , where all peaks are the result of lattice excitations ( phonons ) ; thick solid lines represent the best - fit to a function comprised of a number of temperature - dependent gaussian peaks , thin lines represent the individual phonon peaks in each scan . </S>",
    "<S> scans in panel ( b ) were measured at @xmath24 k and have been fit to the same function used to describe the @xmath25 k data ( with phonon parameters fixed and phonon intensity rescaled to account for thermal population effects ) plus an additional gaussian to account for magnetic inelastic scattering ; thick and thin lines are as in panel ( a ) , medium thickness ( green ) lines represent the magnetic scattering peaks . </S>",
    "<S> adjacent scans are offset by an amount proportional to @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> the low - temperature data were fit by combining the high - temperature phonon model ( with all peak parameters fixed ) plus an additional gaussian peak to capture the magnetic scattering . by comparing the @xmath17-dependence of the phonon and magnetic excitation peak positions it is clear that the two have different dispersion relations , thus confirming the different physical origins of the high and low temperature ins intensities .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : disp002gz ] ]    we find that no set of parameters can coax the hitherto applied model to reproduce these two features seen in our data . </S>",
    "<S> due to the fact that zone - center measurements show the dispersion at @xmath18 to have a gap no larger than @xmath69 @xmath70ev @xcite , any single - ion anisotropy is likely to be small and we expect instead that these unexplained features are related to the network of antisymmetric , i.e. , dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) , interactions in this material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these chiral interactions are ultimately responsible for the stabilization of the slightly incommensurate helical groundstate and field - induced skyrmion phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using our data to fit an extended model including anisotropy will hence allow quantification of these pivotal dm interactions . </S>",
    "<S> related to this , the associated helimagnon excitations are expected to be closely - spaced , and located at low energy close to @xmath18 @xcite . within our finite energy resolution , the presence of these excitations could contribute to the low energy feature in our data , though the energy - scale of the helimagnon bands is not expected to extend up to @xmath63 mev in @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further spectroscopy experiments with improved energy resolution are needed to unveil the nature of these low energy excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> through inelastic neutron scattering experiments we have shown that the magnetic excitation spectrum of @xmath0 exhibits an overall agreement with a proposed model that makes use of five heisenberg - like exchange parameters to describe the coupling between the 16 @xmath31 ions in the unit cell . by comparing ins peak positions with those expected according to model calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we have restricted the five - dimensional parameter space to a single best - fit point that differs from those previously proposed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our dataset also reveals two energy scales that are not expected in theory ; the splitting of the optical magnetic excitation near @xmath30 , and a weakly dispersive feature at low energy near @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that these features could arise due to antisymmetric interactions neglected by the model . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these features suggests that anisotropic effects should be considered in future attempts to fully understand the magnetic excitation spectrum , and ultimately the microscopic description , of the nanometric length - scale skyrmionic spin texture .    </S>",
