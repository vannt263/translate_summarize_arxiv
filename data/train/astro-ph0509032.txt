    "a number of studies have inferred and then shown that strong metal absorption lines in a quasar spectrum are due to gaseous clouds associated to galaxies close to the line - of - sight ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the systematic characterization of the emission properties of these absorber systems is still limited , especially at high redshifts ( see for example @xcite ) . in order to use absorption - line measurements for investigating galaxy formation and evolution , characterizing",
    "the underlying population of galaxies seen in absorption is an important task to achieve .    among metal absorption lines",
    ", the mgii  doublet @xmath11 , detectable from the ground at @xmath12 , has been widely used .",
    "it arises in gas spanning more than five decades of neutral hydrogen column density ( e.g. @xcite ) and the strong systems , defined by @xmath13   are found in the vicinity of galaxies spanning a large range of morphologies .",
    "previous attempts to constrain the properties of mgii absorbers have relied on deep imaging and spectroscopic follow - up of ( arbitrarily faint ) galaxies in the quasar field in order to identify a potential galaxy responsible for the absorption seen in the quasar spectrum .",
    "such expensive studies have been limited to samples of a few tens of quasars .    here",
    "we propose a new approach to measure the systematic photometric properties of large samples ( @xmath14 ) of absorbing systems , which combines statistical analysis of both spectroscopic and imaging datasets of the sloan digital survey ( hereafter sdss , @xcite ) . as mgii lines",
    "can only be detected in sdss spectra in the range @xmath15 , the absorbing galaxies are not identified and , in general , only marginally detected in individual sdss images .",
    "however , they do produce systematic light excesses around the background qsos that can be detected with a statistical analysis consisting of stacking a large number of absorbed qso images .",
    "such a statistical approach has been already proved to be very powerful in detecting and characterizing the very low - surface brightness _ diffuse _ light in galaxy halos @xcite and the intracluster light @xcite . in this _",
    "letter _ we demonstrate that significant detections can be obtained with this technique also for localized sources ( the absorbing galaxies ) in the presence of strong background contamination . preliminary results on the photometric properties of the low @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) absorbers are also analyzed .",
    "more detailed results and analysis for a larger sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_data ]",
    "we present the samples of qsos used in our analysis . the image processing and stacking",
    "are described in sec . [ section_processing ] .",
    "the results are presented and analyzed in sec .",
    "[ section_results ] and conclusive remarks and forthcoming developments are outlined in sec .",
    "[ section_conclusions ] .",
    "standard @xmath18cdm cosmology ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 are adopted throughout the paper .",
    "we use the sample of mgii  absorption line systems compiled by @xcite and based on sdss edr data @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis only on strong systems with a rest equivalent width @xmath1 . in this range",
    "the detection completeness is above 95% . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the main steps involved in the absorption line detection procedure .",
    "for details on the quasar and absorber catalogs , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ the sdss edr provides approximately 3700 qso spectra of sufficiently high redshift to allow the detection of intervening mgii  absorption lines .",
    "the continuum - normalized spectra were searched for mgii@xmath11 doublets using automated routines and interactive confirmation / rejection of candidate systems .",
    "the rest equivalent widths @xmath22 of confirmed systems were measured using an optimal extraction method employing gaussian line - profiles ( or more complex ones where appropriate ) .",
    "all systems were checked for blends and other special cases .",
    "a 5@xmath23 significance level was required for all @xmath24 lines , as well as a @xmath25 significance level for the corresponding @xmath26 lines . only systems 0.1c blue - ward of the quasar redshift and red - ward of ly@xmath27 emission ( so as to avoid the lyman-@xmath28 forest ) were accepted .",
    "systems with separations of less than 500 km / s were considered as a single system . in order to avoid confusion originating from the superposition of multiple absorbers along the same line - of - sight , we exclude from our sample all qsos where distinct @xmath1 absorber systems are detected : they represent 16.3% of qsos with @xmath1 absorptions . the final sample comprises 683 qsos , out of which 2 are excluded because they lie too close to bright stars .",
    "the absorber and qso redshift distribution are shown in figure [ plot_redshift ] .      in order to measure possible systematic light excess around qsos that could contaminate the signal originating from absorbing galaxies",
    ", we use a control sample made of qsos without strong absorbers . for each qso with an absorber system , we randomly look for another qso without any detected absorber down to @xmath29 , such that their redshifts are matched within 0.1 and @xmath4-band brightnesses differ by less than 0.5 mag . in addition , we require that their spectra have similar signal - to - noise ( s / n ) at the wavelengths corresponding to the mgii absorption features .",
    "the last two conditions also imply that the average overall s / n per pixel in the spectra of the two samples differs by less than 0.1 .",
    "thus our procedure ensures that ( i ) the probability of contamination by undetected mgii systems along the line - of - sight is the same for both qsos and ( ii ) photometric systematics which may possibly arise from residuals of the psf subtraction ( see sec .",
    "[ psfsub ] and [ section_results ] ) affect both samples in the same way .",
    "point ( i ) has also been verified by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the qsos selected in this way are called _ reference _ qsos in the following .",
    "their redshift distribution is also shown in fig .",
    "[ plot_redshift ] ( dotted histogram ) .",
    "the image stacking technique aims at producing a high s / n _ average _ image of the qsos , possibly surrounded by absorbing galaxies .",
    "it consists of four basic steps : ( i ) shifting to make images superposable ; ( ii ) intensity rescaling to a uniform photometric calibration ; ( iii ) masking of all unwanted sources ; ( iv ) average - combination of images , after rejecting masked regions .",
    "all the procedures will be thoroughly described in a forthcoming paper . here",
    "we summarize the main points .",
    "we use the raw `` corrected frames '' ( fpc , bias and flat - field corrected ) publicly available in the third data release of the sdss ( @xcite , dr3 ) . steps ( i ) and ( ii ) rely on the centroid calculations and on the photometric calibrations provided by the dr3 catalogs and are performed using standard iraf tasks .",
    "a bi - cubic spline interpolant is used to shift images . regarding step ( iii ) , we note that an ideal mask should retain only the qso and the absorbing galaxy in each image , while blanking out completely all other sources in order to minimize the background noise . in practice",
    "we design our masking algorithm to leave the qso unmasked and to blank all sources which are likely to be in the foreground with respect to the absorber . for each qso",
    "we create three independent masks in @xmath8- , @xmath9- and @xmath4-band , that are eventually combined in the final mask . in each band",
    ", a first mask is obtained from the segmentation image output by sextractor @xcite for a _",
    "clean _ image of the field , from which we have subtracted the de - blended `` atlas image '' of the qso produced by the ` photo ` pipeline @xcite .",
    "this step ensures optimal de - blending of sources from the qso and leaves the qso unmasked .",
    "we retain the masks for all objects with a flux exceeding that expected from @xcite s population synthesis models ( @xcite , hereafter bc03 ) for an extreme case of a luminous blue galaxy : a stellar population with @xmath30 produced by a burst @xmath31 gyr long , observed immediately after the burst end at the redshift of the absorber .",
    "fainter objects are left unmasked .",
    "our tests have shown that the final results do not critically depend on the assumed spectral energy distribution . finally , the masks in the three bands are combined and conservative masks are applied to all objects classified as stars by ` photo ` with @xmath32 .    after subtracting the background value evaluated on the masked image in an annulus between 200 and 250 pixels , the original images",
    "are shifted , intensity - calibrated , and averaged , excluding all masked pixels .",
    "azimuthally averaged surface brightness ( sb ) profiles are extracted in a series of circular apertures which are optimized to integrate on larger areas at larger radii .",
    "a more accurate background level for these profiles is recomputed on the stacked image between 100 and 150 pixels .",
    "the complete covariance matrix of the extracted background - subtracted sb profile is evaluated using the jackknife technique .      to isolate the excess light due to intervening absorbers",
    ", the mean point spread function ( psf ) must be subtracted .",
    "the psf depends on several parameters , such as the time of the observation , the position on a given camera column , and the color of the object . in order to build an effective psf which is representative of the flux - averaged psf of our qsos extended to large angular distances",
    ", we stack stars selected to match each individual qso . we first require stars to be observed in the same observing run and same camera column as the qso .",
    "these stars are then ranked to minimize a combination of the following quantities : ( i ) the difference of gaussian fwhm with respect to the qso ; ( ii ) the angular separation from the qso ; ( iii ) the differences in colors with respect to those of the qso . to map the psf with reasonable s / n at large distances , bright unsaturated stars are also preferred ( @xmath33 mag is always required ) . for each qso in each band , the star that best fulfills all these criteria is chosen . to obtain the correct flux - weighted average psf ,",
    "the intensity of each star is rescaled to the same intensity of the corresponding qso before stacking .",
    "in fig . [ plot_res ] we show the sb residuals measured in the @xmath4-band after the psf subtraction for the sample of 681 qsos with absorbers ( upper panel ) and for the reference qso sample ( lower panel ) .",
    "the stacked psfs are normalized with respect to the qso profiles within an aperture of 4 pixels ( 1.6 ) .",
    "the vertical scale is linear in flux intensity and the horizontal solid line is the background level .",
    "the left vertical axis displays the surface brightness in mag arcsec@xmath34 ( in excess or deficit ) .",
    "error bars are computed from the jackknife covariance matrix and include the budget from the background uncertainty .",
    "central normalization uncertainties are found to be negligible .",
    "we note that within @xmath35  both profiles display sb excesses : these systematic departures from the stellar psf is due to reduced efficiency of source de - blending close to the qso and , partly , to the presence of the qso host galaxy .",
    "however , we see very clearly that from 3  outwards the sb excess is significantly larger for absorbed qsos .",
    "in particular , between 4 and 8  the absorbed qsos display positive sb excesses that are significant at 2 to 4 @xmath23 level each , while the profile of the reference qsos is fully consistent with the background level .",
    "similar results are found for the @xmath9- and @xmath8-band as well .",
    "note that galaxies which produce undetected absorbing systems at different redshifts are expected to be present with the same statistically uniform surface density as in the background .",
    "therefore the sb excess in the absorbed with respect to the reference qsos are solely due to galaxies related to the selected absorption systems .    in table",
    "[ integrated_mags ] we report the fluxes obtained by integrating the psf - subtracted sb within 1.6 and 10  ( @xmath36 kpc in the @xmath7 interval considered ) for the absorbed qsos in @xmath8- , @xmath9- , and @xmath4-band ( columns 1 , 3 , and 5 , respectively , in mag ) .",
    "the attached random errors ( 1 @xmath23 ) are computed by propagating the errors on the residual sb profiles using the complete jackknife covariance matrix . in columns 2 , 4 , and 6",
    "we report the systematic shifts that must be applied to the raw magnitudes integrated on the absorbers samples to correct for the bias in the inner 5 , as measured from the reference sample . corresponding 1 @xmath23 upper and lower limits for this correction",
    "are also attached .",
    "measurements are reported for the whole sample ( 681 qsos ) and for three subsamples of absorber systems binned in @xmath7 : @xmath6 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . assuming the best estimated value for the systematic corrections , for the complete sample we have @xmath39 detection in @xmath8- and @xmath9-band , and @xmath40 in @xmath4 . however , even with the most conservative corrections our detections are significant at 2.9 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and 5.3 @xmath23 ( @xmath4 ) . as expected ,",
    "looking at the three redshift bins , we note that the signal is clearly dominated by the low-@xmath7 one . for this subsample",
    "the significance is @xmath41 in @xmath8 , 5.6 in @xmath9 , and 9.4 in @xmath4 . in the two higher redshift bins the detections in individual bands are not statistically significant",
    ", however the best estimates we derive are consistent with the dimming determined by the larger distance .",

    "we have computed the luminosity function ( lf ) of all resolved sources below the masking threshold around the absorbed qsos and statistically subtracted the analogous lf in the _ reference _ qsos fields .",
    "we find that less than 5% of the flux is contributed by galaxies that are more than 2 mag brighter than the average values given in table [ integrated_mags ] , while 80% is contributed by objects brighter than the average .",
    "the properties we derive are thus well representative of the _ luminosity weighted _ average galaxy emission associated to absorbing systems . + from the photometric data presented above we derive colors within 10  aperture : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , ( the first uncertainty is random error on the direct measure , the second accounts for errors on the systematic correction ) . by neglecting the distribution of absorbers in redshift and assuming the median redshift of the sample",
    ", the comparison with bc03 models of solar - metallicity dust - free single stellar populations indicates that the luminosity - weighted average sed of mgii absorbing galaxies is dominated by fairly young stellar populations ( @xmath71 myr old ) , with a rest - frame @xmath9-band absolute magnitude of @xmath72 .",
    "the inferred rest - frame @xmath73 value is about 2.5 mag , which is compatible with although slightly bluer than the value found by @xcite using direct imaging and spectroscopic follow up . a more sophisticated analysis , in which we compare the observed colors with the @xmath16-folding of uv - optical galaxy templates ( from * ?",
    "* ) normalized to a fixed @xmath74 , confirms that the `` average '' absorbing galaxy has sed similar to local intermediate spirals ( sb - c ) .",
    "more details will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have used a sample of 681 sdss - edr qsos with mgii absorption lines ( @xmath75   ) to demonstrate the feasibility of studying the statistical photometric properties of galaxies associated to mgii absorbing clouds with the sdss . by stacking images of quasars and subtracting the psf ,",

    "systematic biases are measured and removed with 10 to @xmath76% accuracy ( for the total and low-@xmath7 samples ) by using a control sample of qsos without strong absorbers .",
    "as expected , the measured excess light decreases as a function of absorber redshift . at @xmath77 , the mean colors ( @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 ) indicate the presence of relatively young stellar populations and are consistent with the typical absorbing galaxy resembling a local sb - c spiral .",
