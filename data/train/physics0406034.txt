    "the classical problem of water waves over a variable seabed has attracted much attention ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are some significant differences in this interesting and practically important problem , as compared to the theory of waves on a deep water or in canals with a flat horizontal bottom . in situations where the fluid depth is less or of the same order as",
    "a typical length of surface wave , inhomogeneity of the bottom is a reason for linear and nonlinear wave scattering and transformation , and it strongly affects wave propagation .",
    "these phenomena occur so widely that one can meet them almost everywhere , although with different scales .",
    "examples of strongly nonlinear dynamics are ocean waves running on a beach , or motion of disturbed water in a puddle after a car . among linear effects due to bottom topography",
    "is existence of special edge - localized waves discovered by stokes @xcite , that propagate along the shore line of a beach . over an axially symmetric underwater hill ,",
    "quasi - localized wave modes with non - zero angular momentum can exist , similar to long - life - time states of a quantum particle confined by a potential barrier of a finite width @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to say that underwater obstacles of definite shapes and sizes can serve as waveguides ( a narrow and long underwater crest ) or as lenses ( an oblong underwater hill oriented crosswise to the wave propagation ) .",
    "a qualitative explanation for all the linear effects is simple .",
    "indeed , let @xmath0 be the coordinate in the horizontal plane , @xmath1 the depth corresponding to quiet surface . then , looking at the well known dispersion relation for small - amplitude gravitational surface waves , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the frequency , @xmath4 is the absolute value of the wave vector , @xmath5 is the gravitational acceleration ) , one can see that the local refraction index @xmath6 increases as the depth @xmath1 decreases , in accordance with the formulas @xmath7 @xmath8 where the function @xmath9 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ omega_k_h ] ) .",
    "therefore , as in the conventional light optics , here an oblique wave changes its direction of propagation when meets gradient of @xmath10 . also , the total internal reflection is possible in propagation from smaller depth to larger depth .    besides observing such natural phenomena ,",
    "a set of laboratory experiments has been carried out to investigate various aspects of the given problem in more idealized and controlled conditions than are achieved in nature @xcite . in particular , waves over locally periodic bottoms were studied experimentally @xcite , and such a general for periodic media effect was observed as the bragg resonances and the corresponding band structure with gaps in wave spectrum .",
    "it is worth to say that in natural conditions quasi - periodic sand bars occur quite often .    in general",
    ", a qualitative picture of the mentioned phenomena is clear . as concerning the quantitative side of the mathematical theory of waves over a variable bottom , here not everything that necessary",
    "has been done , because practically all developed up to now analytical models and methods are related to the limit cases where the fluid is considered as ideal , and the slope of the bottom is small ( or amplitude of the bottom undulations is small ) .",
    "for the general three - dimensional ( 3d ) hamiltonian theory of water waves , such restriction seems to be unavoidable even in considering the most simple , irrotational flows when the state of the system is described by a minimal set of functions , namely by a pair of canonically conjugated quantities as the deviation @xmath11 of the free surface from the horizontal plane and the boundary value @xmath12 of the velocity potential @xcite .",
    "a technical difficulty exists here that , when working in 3d space , it is impossible to represent in convenient and compact form the kinetic energy functional @xmath13 which is part of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "small values of the bottom slope and of the free surface slope make possible expansion of the hamiltonian to asymptotic series and subsequent application of various variants of the perturbation theory .",
    "in such traditional approach , an inhomogeneous bottom does not allow to write in exact form even linearized equations , not speaking about nonlinear corrections .",
    "there are more favorable conditions for progress in theory of 2d potential ideal flows with a free boundary , and the reason for this is the possibility to employ such powerful mathematical tools as analytical functions and the corresponding conformal mappings .",
    "time - dependent conformal mappings were successfully used for studying strongly nonlinear 2d wave dynamics on deep water and over straight horizontal bottom @xcite .",
    "in the cited works the region occupied by resting fluid ( the lower half - plane or a horizontal stripe ) was mapped onto the region with disturbed free boundary , and the real axis was transformed into moving boundary .",
    "such a conformal `` straightening '' of free surface has provided a compact representation for the hamiltonian , derivation of exact equations of motion , and possibility for precise numerical simulations of the system evolution .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the effect of a strongly undulating bottom on 2d ideal potential flows with a free surface . here",
    "conformal mappings are used as well , and this is done in two variants . in the first , `` moderate '' variant ( sec .",
    "2 ) , a fixed conformal mapping `` straightens '' the bottom , but not the free boundary . more exactly : instead of the cartesian coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( with @xmath15-axis up - directed ) , curvilinear coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 are introduced , and the change of coordinates is performed with the help of an analytical function @xmath18 which maps the stripe @xmath19 onto the region between the horizontal line @xmath20 and the inhomogeneous bottom @xmath21 . in this case",
    "@xmath22 , the horizontal line @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath23 , and on the bottom @xmath24",
    ". the bottom may have arbitrary large slope and even impending pieces where the dependence @xmath25 is multi - valued , as shown in fig.[bandstructure-1 ] .",
    "the shape of free surface will be described by a function @xmath26 .",
    "the lagrangian for weakly - nonlinear waves is represented as an integral series in powers of the dynamical variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with coefficients explicitly depending on the spatial coordinate @xmath16 . in the small - amplitude limit",
    ", the wave dynamics is governed by linear integral - differential equations .",
    "it is using the conformal variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that allows us to obtain these equations in exact form , contrary to the traditional approach where even linearized equations can be obtained only approximately by expansion in the small parameter , the slope of the bottom .",
    "the definition `` moderate '' for this variant emphasizes that straightening of the bottom without straightening the free boundary is able to provide not more than a weakly - nonlinear theory .",
    "nevertheless , such a theory seems to be helpful and applicable in many practical cases when wave amplitude is small .",
    "the results of this part of the work are the derivation of the hamiltonian functional for weakly - nonlinear potential surface waves in canals having arbitrary bottom shape , as well as calculations for band structure of spectrum for a number of periodic bottom profiles . as an example how to treat the linearized equations ,",
    "also the problem is considered of wave reflection on a smooth `` step ''  changing the depth from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .    the other variant of using the conformal mappings may be called `` radical '' in the sense it is valid for arbitrary shape of the bottom and for arbitrary shape of the free surface .",
    "it is an exact combined theory where a time - dependent conformal mapping straightens both the bottom and the free boundary ( sec .",
    "such a mapping can be represented as the result of two mappings : @xmath31 , where the first function @xmath32 maps the horizontal stripe @xmath33 onto the region @xmath34 with the straight lower boundary ( @xmath35 ) and with a perturbed upper boundary , after that the time - independent function @xmath36 maps the half - plane @xmath37 onto the region @xmath38 in the physical plane bounded from below by the bottom .",
    "the shape of the free surface will be described by the formula @xmath39 .",
    "however , it appears that exact nonlinear equations for @xmath40 in the inhomogeneous case have the same form as the known equations for waves over a horizontal bottom @xcite , but with different analyticity requirements imposed on the solutions .",
    "numerical solutions obtained by the spectral method are presented that describe a running and breaking wave ( sec .",
    "so , suppose we know the analytical function @xmath41 which maps the horizontal stripe @xmath19 onto the region occupied by the fluid at rest , and this function takes real values on the real axis : @xmath42 .",
    "the velocity field is irrotational , and the velocity potential @xmath43 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath44 in the flow region @xmath45 , with the boundary conditions @xmath46 , @xmath47 . due to conformal invariance of the laplace equation in 2d - space , hence equation @xmath48 is satisfied as well , with no - penetration boundary condition on the bottom : @xmath49 .",
    "let us now take into account the fact that the lagrangian functional for potential surface waves has the following structure @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and the hamiltonian functional @xmath53 is the total energy of the system  sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy in gravitational field ( in this paper we neglect surface tension effects , though they can be easily incorporated by adding to the hamiltonian the surface energy ) . in our variables",
    "@xmath54 this system has the obvious stable equilibrium @xmath55 , @xmath56 , hence one may consider weak oscillations near this equilibrium state . in a standard way ( see , for instance @xcite ) , let us expand the lagrangian ( [ l_general_uv ] ) in powers of the dynamical variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that due to the symmetry principle the expansion for @xmath59 contains only the odd powers of @xmath17 , while the expansion for @xmath60 contains only the even powers of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore up to the third order in powers of @xmath57 and @xmath58 the lagrangian ( [ l_general_uv ] ) is equal to @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and the equality @xmath63 has been taken into account in the first integral in r.h.s .",

    "this moment corresponds to development of a three - dimensional instability resulting in vortices , splash and foam .      in the second numerical experiment [ referred as ( ii ) ] ,",
    "the shape of the bottom was fixed by analytical function @xmath251 with the dimensionless parameters @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "the initial velocity field was taken zero : @xmath254 , while @xmath255 had the form @xmath256 where @xmath257 qualitatively , these initial conditions are similar to those in the first experiment , however now two oppositely propagating waves are created over inclined region of the bottom , so there is no left - right symmetry in the evolution .",
    "the full system ( [ dot_alpha])-([dot_chi ] ) was solved with a high accuracy for @xmath133 in the limits @xmath258 ( the energy conservation was up to 12 digits for a long `` smooth '' initial stage of the evolution , and it was up to 5 digits for the final stage just before the breaking ) .",
    "this more accurate numerical solution was compared to a less accurate solution obtained with fixed @xmath259 .",
    "the difference was found very small .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are presented in figs.[t0]-[t7 ] . here",
    "we again observe steeping of the wave profile with the tendency towards finite time singularity formation on the crest .",
    "such behavior indeed takes place in natural conditions when the flows are almost two - dimensional .",
    "in this paper we have derived approximate weakly - nonlinear , as well as exact nonlinear equations of motion for potential water waves over a strongly inhomogeneous bottom . the consideration was based on using the conformal mappings . for linear waves over periodic seabed , the band structure of the spectrum has been calculated .",
    "though the obtained exact equations can be written in formally the same form as those derived in @xcite for a straight horizontal bottom , but admissible solutions have different analytical properties if the bottom is inhomogeneous .",
    "when the equations are written in this form , the bottom shape is preserved as an integral of motion .",
    "of course , the above `` inviscid theory '' works only on large enough spatial scales and only until the singularity moment , as it was clear from the very beginning . practically , this theory is good for description sea and ocean waves before their breaking .",
    "these investigations were supported by the intas under grant number 00292 , by rfbr , by the russian state program for support of the leading scientific schools , and by the russian science support foundation ."
