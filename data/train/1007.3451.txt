    "due to the extensive studies on the physical properties of the cuprates , many constraints on the pairing mechanism of their high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) have been accumulated .",
    "there is no doubt that the strong coulomb interaction and the resultant strong electron correlations play crucial roles .",
    "this effect is believed to be described by single - band hubbard or @xmath3-@xmath4 models in 2d , and the magnetic mechanism for superconductivity has been proposed with the focus on the short range antiferromagnetism or spin singlet formation.@xcite these models have achieved great success in explaining many of the physical properties , such as the pseudogap , generalized magnetic susceptibility observed by neutron scattering , and the single particle green s function found in angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes )",
    ". however , these models are not successful in explaining the variation of in superconducting transition temperature t@xmath0 from material to material and other material dependent properties .",
    "for example , the famous t - linear resistivity within the plane is universally observed among various cuprates , while t@xmath0 s differ by two orders of magnitude.@xcite it is surprising that the resistivity , which is one of the most representative physical observables of the electronic states in solids , is irrelevant to t@xmath0 .",
    "the 2d hubbard and @xmath3-@xmath4 models contain only a few parameters , such as hopping parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and interactions @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",
    "one possibility is that the range of the hopping and magnitude of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are key factors determining t@xmath0 , which is determined by the structure and chemical composition perpendicular to the cuo@xmath8 plane.@xcite however , studies on the @xmath3-@xmath4 model have found that finite @xmath5 suppresses superconducting correlations.@xcite recent investigations of the single - band hubbard model using cluster dynamical mean field theory calculations@xcite do not show increased tendencies towards pairing for larger @xmath5 but variational studies do,@xcite although the latter may be less controlled .    from a structural point of view , the only known empirical rule of t@xmath0 is that it increases at optimal doping as the number of cuo@xmath8 layers @xmath9 is increased for @xmath10 .",
    "anderson noticed this @xmath9-dependence at a early stage , and proposed the interlayer mechanism of superconductivity.@xcite the idea is that the single - particle interlayer hopping is suppressed by strong correlations within the layer , while the two - particle hopping is not .",
    "the onset of the latter below t@xmath0 leads to the condensation energy of superconductivity .",
    "experimentally it is found that the @xmath1-axis electron hopping is actually suppressed and there is no coherent band formation perpendicular to the plane.@xcite there is no plasmon observed in the normal state , and below t@xmath0 the josephson plasmon appears in the low energy region ( @xmath11 mev).@xcite the idea of an interlayer mechanism has also been criticized in light of the @xmath1-axis oscillator strength , and has subsequently been abandoned.@xcite    increasing evidence for the importance of out - of - plane effects continues to accrue , which points to limitations of intrinsic planar models for the cuprates .",
    "for example , the correlation of out - of - phase oxygen dopant ions in bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath12 ( bi-2212 ) with features in the tunneling density of states @xcite has been interpreted in terms of a local increase of the superconducting pair potential.@xcite in addition , the rapid suppression of t@xmath0 with out - of - plane cation dopants compared to in - plane dopants is surprising given that the former do not appreciably affect in - plane resistivities.@xcite t@xmath0 has also been empirically correlated with the madelung energy difference between apical and planar oxygen atoms.@xcite this has been recently supported by studies on ba@xmath8ca@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15f@xmath8 , a compound which has vastly different transition temperatures by exchanging f with o at the apical site.@xcite arpes studies have inferred a pairing gap which is a factor of 2 larger on the bonding band in comparison to the anti - bonding band,@xcite a trend consistent with other cuprates.@xcite since the fermi surface of the bonding band lies far away from either the antiferromagnetic reciprocal lattice zone boundary , or the van hove points , linking the pairing mechanism with a purely electronic mechanism is not straightforward .    as discussed in refs . and , the madelung energy difference and @xmath5 are directly linked .",
    "_ pointed out that the maximal t@xmath0 in each family of cuprate materials scales with the next nearest hopping @xmath5.@xcite the energy of the cu 4@xmath16 orbital relative to the @xmath17-@xmath18 band largely determines @xmath5 as the hybridization with the planar oxygen orbitals allows electrons to more effectively hop between 2@xmath19 orbitals .",
    "strong apical 2@xmath20 - 4@xmath16 hybridization , determined by the madelung energy difference , raises the energy of the 4@xmath16 orbital relative to the @xmath17 band , reducing the effective hopping @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the further away the apical oxygen is located from the cuo@xmath8 plane the larger @xmath5.@xcite similar empirical relations between t@xmath0 and structural details can also be found .",
    "for example , there is an optimal distance between the apical oxygen site and the mirror plane of the unit cell for which t@xmath0 takes on its maximum value , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : tc_vs_d ] .",
    "however , despite these observations , a direct connection between changes in the bandstructure and the pairing mechanism is lacking and to date , the connection between t@xmath0 and these @xmath1-axis effects remains an empirical intrigue lacking a firm microscopic understanding .",

    "a phonon mechanism has also been pursued since the discovery of htsc.@xcite the original intuition by bednorz and mller was that the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect with high - frequency oxygen phonon modes leads to htsc.@xcite however , the degeneracy of the two @xmath21 orbitals is lifted considerably ( @xmath22 ev ) and the jt effect is now believed to be ineffective .",
    "furthermore , there are several experiments suggesting a minor role played by phonons .",
    "these include the small isotope effect on t@xmath0 at optimal doping , @xcite the absence of the phonon effect on the temperature dependence of the resistivity,@xcite and the absence of the phonon bottle - neck effect.@xcite this conclusion was also supported by early density functional calculations which did not give appreciably high values of couplings and did not support a high t@xmath0 in a bcs picture.@xcite    the high - t@xmath0 cuprates , as strongly correlated systems , have attracted a great deal of theoretical interest .",
    "@xcite part of this interest has been focused on examining the renormalization of electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interactions by strong electron - electron ( el - el ) correlations .",
    "@xcite for example , studies of the @xmath23 model incorporating an el - ph interaction indicate that polaron crossover may occur at a weaker el - ph coupling strength than in the case of a pure el - ph coupling model .",
    "@xcite quantum monte carlo treatments of the single - band hubbard - holstein model have shown that the renormalized el - ph vertex develops a strong forward scattering peak with no substantial suppression of the el - ph vertex when the hubbard u is large  @xcite with similar results obtained for the @xmath3-@xmath4 model .",
    "@xcite however , using slave - boson approaches , the hubbard model plus el - ph interaction was found to possess no significant forward scattering peak together with an overall suppression of the el - ph vertex at low temperature .",
    "@xcite this same study observed an enhancement in the el - ph vertex for small @xmath24 scattering at high temperature , which was linked to phase separation .",
    "cumulant expansion techniques  @xcite have also found an enhancement of the el - ph vertex for small @xmath24 , again interpreted in terms of incipient phase separation when approaching a critical value of @xmath7 .",
    "the single - band hubbard - holstein model has also been studied within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) . in one study@xcite the effect of the el - ph interaction was to stabilize the insulating state in the vicinity of the density - driven mott transition . in a paramagnetic dmft study @xcite",
    "the el - ph interaction was found to have little effect on the low energy physics produced by the hubbard interaction while modifying the spectral weight associated with the upper and lower hubbard bands at higher energy . from these results",
    "it was concluded that the primary effect of the el - ph interaction was to reduce the effective value of @xmath7 .",
    "later work@xcite considered antiferromagnetic solutions in the presence of el - ph coupling and observed different behavior with strong polaronic effects . in this case , the critical coupling for polaron formation was observed to shift to larger values as the system was doped away from half - filling .",
    "the dichotomy between the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic treatments@xcite indicates the possible importance of the magnetic order in considering the el - ph interaction in correlated systems . finally",
    ", a dmft study invoking a lang - firsov transformation for the lattice degrees of freedom has found evidence for a competition between the mott insulating ( metallic ) and bipolaronic insulating phases near ( away from ) half - filling.@xcite    using the dynamical cluster approximation , an extension of dmft , examinations of the el - ph interaction within small hubbard clusters  @xcite find an overall suppression of @xmath25-wave superconducting t@xmath0 with increasing el - ph coupling .",
    "this occurs despite an increase in the apparent pairing correlations within the @xmath26 channel .",
    "the reduction in t@xmath0 was attributed to polaron formation , which reduces quasi - particle weight at the fermi level and suppresses t@xmath0 through the loss of carrier mobility .",
    "the enhancement of pairing correlations reported in ref .",
    "indicates that the bare el - ph vertex has been renormalized in favour of @xmath25-wave pairing , consistent with the observations of ref .  .",
    "furthermore , exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies on the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , which include el - ph coupling to buckling and breathing vibrations , also show that the former enhance @xmath25-wave pairing while the latter suppress it.@xcite while these results provide no definitive interpretation of the effect of el - ph coupling in strongly correlated systems , there is strong evidence that whatever impact strong correlations may have , the el - ph interaction may still play a significant role that should not be overlooked in these systems .    from an experimental front",
    ", the role of phonons in htsc has become more prominent in recent years . while long - studied from raman , infrared , and neutron measurements , recent arpes and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements on several cuprates has reinvigorated the exploration of the role of phonons on htsc.@xcite experiments on bi-2212,@xcite la@xmath27sr@xmath28cuo@xmath14 ( lsco),@xcite bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cuo@xmath29 ( bi-2201 ) , @xcite ba@xmath8ca@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15f@xmath8,@xcite and tl families tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath15 ( tl-2212 ) , tlba@xmath8ca@xmath8cu@xmath13o@xmath30 ( tl-1223 ) , and tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cuo@xmath31 ( tl-2201)@xcite have revealed kinks in the energy dispersion of these materials .",
    "these kinks have been interpreted as hubbard renormalizations,@xcite coupling to the neutron resonance and/or spin continuum,@xcite and engelsberg - schrieffer renormalizations@xcite due to coupling of electrons to a collection of optical phonons .",
    "these phonons include the out - of - phase @xmath1-axis oxygen buckling modes and the in - plane cu - o bond - stretching modes .",
    "the dispersion kink observed in the nodal region , ( @xmath32 ) - ( @xmath33 ) , and the peak - dip - hump structure observed in the anti - nodal region , @xmath34-(@xmath33 ) , clearly shows that the electrons are interacting with bosons of a well defined energy @xmath35 and @xmath36 mev , respectively .",
    "for the nodal region , it has been convincingly argued that this structure is due to the oxygen bond - stretching phonon as the kink is observed independent of superconductivity and of the presence / absence of the spin resonance peak . as for the anti - nodal region",
    ", it has been claimed that the kink appears only below t@xmath0 , and hence it is attributed to the spin resonance mode at 41 mev.@xcite however , an extensive study conducted more recently has found the evidence for the kink structure in the normal state and over a wide range of momentum space.@xcite further , contrasting single and multilayer cuprate `` kinks '' , and materials known to have a neutron resonance , also indicates that the observed renormalizations are most likely due to optical phonons , although this is still controversial.@xcite    it is well known that the @xmath1-axis phonons show some of the most dramatic lineshape changes with doping and temperature compared to any phonons observed via neutron@xcite and raman@xcite scattering .",
    "for example , the apical phonon frequency shifts by as much as 20 @xmath37 with doping and temperature in a number of compounds : la@xmath27sr@xmath28cuo@xmath38 , hgba@xmath8ca@xmath39cu@xmath40o@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and bi@xmath8sr@xmath8ca@xmath8cu@xmath13o@xmath43.@xcite moreover , recent arpes data on bi-2201 have shown kinks in the energy range of the @xmath1-axis phonons which are weaker in overdoped compounds in comparison to optimal doped compounds.@xcite this has also been interpreted in terms of increased screening of the el - ph interaction with increasing hole concentrations .",
    "in addition , the anomaly of the raman @xmath44-polarized mode due to the onset of superconductivity is observed in three- and four - layer compounds.@xcite this has been successfully analyzed in terms of the internal electric field produced by the interlayer josephson plasmon and its coupling to the phonon .",
    "this means that the system behaves as an ionic crystal along the @xmath1-axis in the normal state , and suddenly turns into a superconductor .",
    "while the role of the neutron resonance and phonons remains controversial , it is of relevant interest whether these signatures in arpes may be used as an angle - resolved analogy to the tunnelling ripples in conventional superconductors,@xcite thus providing information on the pairing mechanism in the cuprates . in order to connect el - ph coupling to a possible pairing mechanism",
    "a systematic study of coupling across families of cuprate materials is desirable . in ref .",
    "arpes observed renormalizations of the band were interpreted as due to the @xmath2 branch for anti - nodal electrons and the bond - stretching branch for nodal electrons .",
    "while the latter coupling is of a deformation type , the coupling constructed for the @xmath2 branch involves a charge - transfer between planar oxygens due to a modulation of the electrostatic or madelung energies of the planar oxygen sites .",
    "a local crystal field , generated by a mirror plane symmetry breaking , allows for a coupling at first order in atomic displacements.@xcite ( we note here that the @xmath44/@xmath2 nomenclature only holds for raman @xmath45 momentum transfers .",
    "however , throughout this work we denote the entire out - of - phase branch as  @xmath2 \" and the entire in - phase branch as  @xmath46 . ) since the cuprates are poor conductors along the @xmath1-axis , the electrostatic interaction can be thought to be largely unscreened .",
    "calculations based on ewald s method have been performed on yba@xmath8cu@xmath13o@xmath47 ( ybco)@xcite and large crystal fields have been obtained and the resulting coupling matches well with the coupling determined from fano lineshape analysis of raman data.@xcite    recently , the issue of whether the el - ph coupling in the cuprates is strong enough to explain the observed band renormalizations has been revisited via density functional ( lda ) calculations , @xcite updating previous estimates.@xcite while many efforts have been made to extract bosonic coupling from arpes renormalizations in the cuprates , there is no widely accepted way to uniquely determine the strength of the coupling at kink energies , and thus reliable comparisons of calculations with experiment must be viewed with some caution.@xcite while lda calculations have provided remarkably good agreement with phonon dispersions , there are a number of facets of lda calculations which may only provide part of the story of el - ph coupling .",
    "as lda calculations overestimate the itinerancy of the electrons , they describe the cuprates as good metals even at half - filling .",
    "moreover , the obtained interlayer transfer integral and hence the @xmath1-axis plasmon frequency is both coherent and much larger than the experimental observation . both of these factors serve to overestimate the screening ability of the cuprates , especially in the underdoped region , and",
    "thus underestimates the strength of the el - ph interaction .",
    "this may be one of the reasons why lda predicts smaller linewidths for the half - breathing oxygen bond - stretching modes and the apical oxygen modes , sometimes by more than one order of magnitude.@xcite it is therefore not clear if these findings indicate that the el - ph coupling is small or that dft - based approaches alone are inadequate for describing the physics of the cuprates .",
    "as has been found in stm experiments,@xcite a nano - scale inhomogeneous structure on a length scale of 15 @xmath48 exists universally in bi-2212 and ybco",
    ". this length scale can not be larger than the screening length and we can conclude that the screening length within the cuo@xmath8 plane is not shorter than 15 @xmath48 , much longer than the thomas - fermi screening length of the typical metal ( @xmath49  ) . furthermore , charge transfer between the layers is almost prohibited . as a result of the transfer integral between",
    "the layer is proportional to @xmath50 ^ 2 $ ] , the opening of the pseudogap in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 regions strongly suppresses the interlayer hopping . considering these discrepancies between lda and experiments",
    ", one can imagine that the el - ph coupling is in reality much stronger than lda predicts .",
    "focusing on the buckling modes , theoretical consideration have been limited to the two - dimensional plane and the inter - layer coulomb interaction has been neglected .",
    "this is usually justified in the metal since the screening length is much shorter than the interlayer distance .",
    "this is not the case in the cuprates .    in this paper",
    "we provide a comprehensive and self - contained story on el - ph coupling to oxygen phonons as a function of doping across the cuprate families .",
    "we formulate a theory for el - ph coupling in the cuprates taking into account the local environment around the cuo@xmath8 planes , the poor screening of charge fluctuations out of the plane , doping - dependent band character variations , and structural differences across the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a general discussion of el - ph coupling to @xmath1-axis oxygen phonons . after summarizing prior work on the out - of - plane planar oxygen modes ,",
    "we then provide a derivation of the coupling to modes involving @xmath1-axis apical oxygen motion . in section iii",
    "we then discuss the anisotropy of the bare couplings and examine the total strength of the bare el - ph coupling and its contribution to the single - particle self - energy and @xmath25-wave anomalous self - energy .    in section",
    "iv we develop the formalism for poor screening and examine its implications for the anisotropy and overall magnitude of the renormalized el - ph vertices . due to the poor @xmath1-axis conductivity we find that the @xmath1-axis phonons can not be effectively screened for small in - plane momentum transfer @xmath53 .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced as the crystal becomes more ionic and screening becomes increasingly inoperable in the underdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath2 modes the coupling is anomalously anti - screened producing an enhancement of the coupling in the anti - nodal region . in terms the projected @xmath25-wave couplings , the small @xmath53 behavior of the screened vertices produces an enhancement in the total phonon contribution to pairing .",
    "therefore , the combined effects of poor screening reduces the total el - ph coupling and enhances the @xmath25-wave projected coupling with doping .",
    "this has important implications for the doping dependence of the el - ph self - energies probed by arpes as well as any contribution to pairing mediated by phonons .    in section",
    "v we turn to materials trends and a systematic examination of the madelung potential and crystal field strengths across the bi- , tl- and hg families of cuprates is presented . here , using an ionic point charge model and the ewald summation technique , we identify systematic trends in the strength of the crystal fields which mirror trends in the material s t@xmath0 at optimal doping . through this observation",
    "we link the structure and chemical composition to the strength of the coupling to the @xmath1-axis modes and discuss how this can be used to understand the large variations in t@xmath0 observed across the cuprates .",
    "we also present considerations for doping - induced changes to the value of the crystal field in bi-2212 .    in light of these findings",
    ", section vi presents a simple two - channel model for pairing in the cuprates , which includes a dominant , @xmath25-wave pairing , high - energy bosonic mode and a weaker phonon mode . using this model",
    ", we demonstrate that phonons can provide a sizeable enhancement to t@xmath0 which is in excess of the t@xmath0 that would be obtained from phonons alone . furthermore ,",
    "due to the dominant bosonic mode , the resulting value of the isotope exponent @xmath54 is small ( @xmath55 ) despite the large enhancement of t@xmath0 ( @xmath56 k ) .",
    "this calculation , in combination with the materials and doping dependent trends identified in the previous sections , shows that a phonon assisted pairing model provides a natural framework for understanding trends observed for t@xmath0 across the cuprates .",
    "finally , in section vii we conclude by summarizing our findings and discuss open questions concerning el - ph coupling in strongly correlated systems .",
    "in addition to the treatment outline above , in the appendix we explore how el - ph coupling to @xmath1-axis modes is modified by strong correlations in the half - filled parent insulators using exact diagonalization of small multi - band hubbard clusters .",
    "specifically we address how el - ph coupling modifies the properties of the zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) . here",
    "we find that static lattice displacements have a strong influence on the zrs hoppings , energy and antiferromagnetic exchange energy j. these results have a direct impact on the use of down - folded models such as the @xmath3-@xmath4 model as they indicate that the effects of the el - ph coupling can not be simply cast as modulations of a single parameter such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or the energy of the zrs .",
    "in this section we present a review of some generic considerations for electrons coupling to oxygen motions in- and out- of the cuo@xmath8 plane . since many of the derivations have appeared before , we can be brief , with the main aim to generalize previous results to a five band model in order to include off - axis orbitals and apical oxygen phonon modes .",
    "we begin by considering an ideal cuo@xmath8 plane isolated from its environment .",
    "since hopping integrals are modulated to second order in atomic displacements along the @xmath1-axis , the el - ph coupling due to this mechanism is weak .",
    "however , if the same plane is placed in an asymmetric electrostatic environment a local crystal field , which breaks mirror plane symmetry , provides a coupling linear in displacement .",
    "the plane must then spontaneously buckle in a pattern where the oxygen ( copper ) atoms are displaced away from ( towards ) the mirror plane .    in a three band",

    "although it is clear that the overall strength of the el - ph interaction is too small to support htsc on its own , @xcite phonons are not precluded from contributing to pairing , enhancing the pairing correlations from another dominant interaction .",
    "such a possibility has been considered in previous works that have examined the contribution of el - ph coupling in conjunction with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.@xcite in such a scenario , a baseline t@xmath0 is set by the dominant pairing mechanism , typically identified with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "such an interaction is likely to be governed by the properties of the cuo@xmath8 plane , such as the charge transfer energy @xmath362 or antiferromagnetic exchange energy @xmath4 , and therefore the strength of this interaction is likely independent of the material .",
    "t@xmath0 is then further enhanced by the weaker contribution from the el - ph interaction which , as we have shown , is strongly materials dependent .",
    "this picture naturally explains the variations in t@xmath0 that are observed across materials and provides a microscopic connection between the structure and composition of the unit cell and the t@xmath0 of the material .    in the next section",
    "we continue examine such a multi - channel model and present simplified considerations for t@xmath0 in order to assess the degree to which phonons can enhance a dominant interaction at high energy . as we will show , moderate values of @xmath232 , such as those given in fig .",
    "[ fig : oxygencharacter]c , can lead to sizeable enhancement to t@xmath0 which is greater than the t@xmath0 that would result from phonons alone .",
    "phonons are therefore capable of providing a sufficiently large enhancement to t@xmath0 despite the relatively low value of their total coupling @xmath232 .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to considerations for t@xmath0 by considering contributions to pairing from multiple channels .",
    "t@xmath0 , one of the most difficult quantity to calculate correctly , varies across the cuprate families by two orders of magnitude even though the same cuo@xmath8 building block is present .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated , the total el - ph coupling for the @xmath2 branch shows a strong materials dependence which is empirically correlated with the observed value of t@xmath0 at optimal doping .",

    "a similar approach has recently been used@xcite to account for the qualitative structures in the phonon - modulated density of states of the cuprates as observed by stm.@xcite implicit in this calculation is the assumption that the dominant pairing channel can be described in terms of a boson exchange mechanism and such a scenario is the simplest one which can be adopted in examining the idea of phonon - enhanced htsc .",
    "however , such a model can be perhaps be justified based on several recent works .",
    "for example , studies of the penetration depth in electron - doped cuprates using a model with coexisting afm and sc order has produced good agreement with experiment indicating the importance of afm in these systems.@xcite furthermore , a dmft study of optical conductivity in a moderately correlated single - band hubbard model,@xcite has concluded that afm with moderate correlations is the correct picture for describing the underdoped cuprates rather than strongly correlated mott physics .",
    "finally , a study of the @xmath3-@xmath4 and hubbard models has shown that the @xmath25-wave pairing in these models have a significant contribution from a retard component with an energy set by a few times @xmath4 or a fraction of @xmath7 in the @xmath3-@xmath4 and hubbard models , respectively.@xcite this result indicates that the pairing interaction in these models is largely retarded in nature with an energy scale set by the dynamics of the magnetic excitation spectrum .",

    "such a picture may not be completely applicable , especially in the underdoped region of the phase diagram where the role of correlations becomes more prominent .",
    "as the role of correlations and its interplay with the el - ph interaction is better understood the details of the picture presented here may change .",
    "however , the phonon - mediated enhancement of t@xmath0 is expected remain as a general phenomenon .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of correlations may further enhance the phonon contribution to t@xmath0 through possible enhancements of the el - ph vertex or proximity to afm .",
    "for example , recent dmft work examining phonon - mediated pairing in the fullerides@xcite has found that a phonon - mediated pairing mechanism , which produces an exponentially small t@xmath0 when considered on its own , will be significantly enhanced in proximity to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the mechanism via which this occurs is a density of states enhancement due to a narrowing of the quasi - particle band and mott physics .",
    "this is a different origin than the enhancement reported here where we are concerned with the overall effects of coherence and band width of the paired electrons .",
    "some aspects of the mott physics is included in our considerations in the form of the breakdown of metallic screening along the @xmath1-axis ( a coulomb effect ) however , we have not included the breakdown of carrier properties in the cuo@xmath8 plane .",
    "this is an intriguing possibility but it is beyond the scope of our paper and we leave it for future work .",
    "finally , it has recently shown that high values of t@xmath0 are also obtainable from el - ph coupling without invoking a second dominant pairing interaction by departing from the conventional fermi liquid framework . in ref .",
    "it was shown that t@xmath0 s on the order of 100 k are attainable for @xmath232 values similar to those obtained here , provided the normal state behaves as a non - fermi - liquid quantum critical metal .",
    "although the simple approach outlined here does not hold in this scenario , much of the doping and materials - dependent variations in coupling still do .",
    "although there appears to be a great deal of universality in the hole - doped cuprates , large changes in t@xmath0 can be achieved through changes in the chemical composition and structure of the unit cell . as we have shown here",
    ", these changes are reflected in a number of properties including the orbital character of the band crossing the fermi level , the strength of local electric fields arising from structural - induced symmetry breaking , doping dependent changes in the underlying band structure , and ionicity of the crystal governing its ability to screen @xmath1-axis perturbations .",
    "given the sensitivity of t@xmath0 to the structural details of the crystal it is clear that the underlying mechanism(s ) for htsc must incorporate these elements in some way . in this work",
    "we have examined a number of aspects of coupling to oxygen modes and demonstrated that the overall coupling to these modes is quite sensitive to these factors .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of el - ph coupling to these modes provides a natural means of linking the electronic properties of the cuo@xmath8 plane to the structural elements of the material lying off plane and the carrier concentration .",
    "this picture calls for oxygen phonons to play a role in htsc .    in extending the previous works by some of the authors on el - ph coupling in the cuprates , we have formulated a theory for poor screening in these materials . due to the quasi-2d nature of the cuprates with poor conductivity along the @xmath1-axis",
    ", we have shown that a window of small @xmath24 opens in which screening is inoperable .",
    "this results in an overall enhancement of the total @xmath25-wave projected coupling which enhances the phonon s ability to mediate @xmath25-wave pairing . with progressive doping , the total phonon contribution to @xmath228 is enhanced while the total contribution from @xmath226 , which suppresses @xmath25-wave pairing , is screened away . as a result , doping the system away from half - filling results in an increased contribution to @xmath25-wave superconductivity mediated by el - ph coupling .    a systematic examination of the variation in el - ph coupling across the cuprate families was also performed . using experimental structural data we determined the materials variation in the total electric field strength and orbital character of the @xmath17-@xmath18 band at the fermi level and the expected variations in el - ph coupling strength to the @xmath2 branch . a direct correlation between the strength of the coupling and the optimal t@xmath0 for each material was observed . as a result , the materials variation in t@xmath0 can be naturally accounted for through the inclusion of el - ph coupling to the presently accepted intrinsic planar models .    to be clear",
    ", we do not suggest that el - ph coupling alone accounts for htsc as both the bare and screened values for the el - ph coupling strength are insufficient to produce large t@xmath0 s on their own .",
    "instead , we propose that the phonons work in conjunction with the presently unidentified dominant mechanism for htsc .",
    "the simplified multi - channel model for t@xmath0 presented here has demonstrated that moderate el - ph coupling , when combined with spin fluctuations , can produce enhancements to the total t@xmath0 in excess of the contribution produced by phonons alone .",
    "furthermore , this enhancement is expected to be a generic phenomena and independent of the presently second mechanism .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the el - ph interaction can account for the large variations in t@xmath0 observed across the cuprate as a function of material and doping .    there are some open issues regarding el - ph coupling in the cuprates .",
    "first of all , our examination of the field strength as a function of material neglected any doping - induced changes to the field strengths .",
    "our simplified treatment of the bi - layer system bi-2212 showed that these effects can be substantial .",
    "therefore , this problem requires a systematic examination of the doping process across the families of cuprates , perhaps with more sophisticated approaches .",
    "this issue is complicated in the multi - layer systems with @xmath423 where there is the possibility for inequivalent dopings for the cuo@xmath8 planes.@xcite this can further modify charge distributions altering the strength of the crystal fields in each plane.@xcite any systematic treatment of the doping induced fields should take this into account .",
    "there is also the additional question of the role of covalency in determining the overall field strength .",
    "finally , we have investigated the role of el - ph coupling in the cuprates , taking into account the long range coulomb interaction and its role in screening .",
    "however , the role of the short - range coulomb interaction and its affect on the el - ph interaction remains an open and intriguing question .",

    "the first - order correction to the energy does not vanish and both @xmath451 and @xmath452 .",
    "the magnitude of the modulation in @xmath3 is comparable to the @xmath2 mode with the same local field .",
    "the effect of the apical mode on @xmath3 is very weak for @xmath453 .",
    "this is not surprising since the zrs has little apical character if the orbital lies away from the cuo@xmath8 plane . for @xmath454 the hybridization of the apical-@xmath91 and cu-@xmath455 orbitals destabilizes the zrs and thus the effective hopping @xmath3 drops as in an earlier work.@xcite also , both the ground state energy @xmath342 and the effective exchange @xmath4 are not affected much by this mode .",
    "( color online ) variation of the effective zhang - rice hopping @xmath5 and magnetic exchange @xmath426 to next - nearest neighbor .",
    "the calculation performed for the cu@xmath8o@xmath425 cluster for @xmath44- , @xmath2- and apex - modes . ]",
    "it is clear , based on the calculations performed , that the three modes modify the effective hopping of the zrs .",
    "however , the mechanism by which the apical mode affects the hopping is very different since the formation of the zrs no longer takes place in the cuo@xmath8 plane if the displacement of the apical oxygen is towards the plane .",
    "the effective next - nearest neighbour quantities @xmath5 and @xmath426 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : edresults2 ] ) are affected less by the two planar modes .    summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : edresults ] and [ fig : edresults2 ] , our results indicate that for both the @xmath44 and @xmath2 phonons , @xmath456 as well as @xmath457 corrections have a linear dependence on displacement of about the same magnitude . for the apical phonon",
    "the magnitude is different due to the destabilization of the zrs .",
    "the on - site energy is modified mainly by the @xmath44 ep - ph coupling ; which can be quantified by looking at the corresponding modification of the ground - state energy .",
    "modifications to parameters @xmath458 and @xmath459 indicate again that the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath44 mode . however , this conclusion is based on a naive cluster approach and should be corroborated by other means of investigation .    in terms of treatments of effective single - band models , such as hubbard or @xmath3-@xmath4 , incorporating phonons",
    ", we note that our results indicate that the effective couplings for these modes are neither purely holstein - like nor can they be treated as bond phonons simply modifying the effective zrs hopping @xmath3 : the effective parameters , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and as a consequence , the mott - hubbard effective interaction @xmath7 in a single - band approach , are all modified .",
    "the actual modification of the effective @xmath7 for static displacements corresponding to these phonon modes requires an investigation of different three - band clusters containing cu @xmath460 , @xmath461 and @xmath462 and oxygen ligand configurations .",
    "this points out the complications involved in ascribing real phonon modes to any corresponding model phonons in a single - band approach , and illustrates the important interplay between el - ph coupling and electronic correlations .",

    "<S> the large variations of t@xmath0 across the cuprate families is one of the major unsolved puzzles in condensed matter physics , and is poorly understood . although there appears to be a great deal of universality in the cuprates , several orders of magnitude changes in t@xmath0 can be achieved through changes in the chemical composition and structure of the unit cell . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a systematic examination of the variations in electron - phonon coupling to oxygen phonons in the cuprates , incorporating a number of effects arising from several aspects of chemical composition and doping across cuprate families . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the electron - phonon coupling is a very sensitive probe of the material - dependent variations of chemical structure , affecting the orbital character of the band crossing the fermi level , the strength of local electric fields arising from structural - induced symmetry breaking , doping dependent changes in the underlying band structure , and ionicity of the crystal governing the ability of the material to screen @xmath1-axis perturbations . using electrostatic ewald calculations and known experimental structural data , we establish a connection between the material s maximal t@xmath0 at optimal doping and the strength of coupling to @xmath1-axis modes . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that materials with the largest coupling to the out - of - phase bond - buckling (  @xmath2 \" ) oxygen phonon branch also have the largest t@xmath0 s . in light of this observation we present model t@xmath0 calculations using a two - well model where phonons work in conjunction with a dominant pairing interaction , presumably due to spin fluctuations , indicating how phonons can generate sizeable enhancements to t@xmath0 despite the relatively small coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> combined , these results can provide a natural framework for understanding the doping and material dependence of t@xmath0 across the cuprates . </S>"
