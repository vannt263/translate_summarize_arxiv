    "they point out that if the optical / nir ( and by extension the nuv ) spectrum is jet dominated , then it should be flat from the radio regime through the optical , and @xmath1 .",
    "one can also make predictions for whether the nuv light is consistent with x - ray emission reprocessed by the outer accretion disk .",
    "@xcite show that under simple geometric assumptions , reprocessed emission should be proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the orbital separation of the system .",
    "finally , if the nuv emission is direct emission from the accretion disk , we might naively expect the @xmath4 to track @xmath5 directly . in a study of an ensemble of 13 nsxrbs observed over many orders of magnitude of x - ray luminosity ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the optical / nir emission is more consistent with the prediction of reprocessed x - ray emission .",

    ", @xcite were able to show that the nuv flux tracks closely with the 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission , with a best - fit slope of @xmath7 .",
    "as the 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission is an effective proxy for the hard x - ray emission detected by the bat ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , this is consistent with the hypothesis that the nuv emission is reprocessed hard x - ray emission .",
    "this was the first time that the nuv emission was definitively shown to be reprocessed hard x - ray emission for a single black hole lmxb source over a wide range of x - ray and nuv luminosities .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of an ensemble of black hole lmxbs in @xcite .",

    "ginga_. over these 7 observations , cyg  x-2 was seen in all three branches of the z track : horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) and flaring branch ( fb ) . from these observations @xcite conclude that both the nuv continuum and line emission increase monotonically along the z track , with the least emission in the hb , and the most in the fb .",
    "they model the nuv emission as a combination of reprocessed x - rays from the disk , along with a small ( at most 20% ) contribution from the x - ray heated surface of the companion star .",
    "in addition , they find no direct correlation between the nuv ( continuum or line ) flux and x - ray ( 1 - 14 kev ) flux from the observations .",
    "@xcite also discuss this joint x - ray / nuv monitoring campaign of cyg  x-2 . as the shape of the x - ray spectrum changes over the z track ,",
    "they argue that the accretion disk is a superior bolometer than our x - ray detectors because it is insensitive to bandpass effects .",
    "assuming the nuv emission is dominated by reprocessed hard x - ray emission , and thus the nuv emission tracks the total x - ray emission , @xcite argue the nuv emission tracks the mass accretion rate , @xmath11 . combined with the hint that the uv continuum increases along the z track ,",
    "they conclude that the mass accretion rate increases along the z track from hb - nb - fb .",
    "note , however , that @xcite suggest that the uv increase from hb - nb - fb is not conclusive and does not imply an increase of mass accretion rate .",
    "even after many decades of observations of the x - ray spectra of nsxrbs , there is still not a clear consensus as to the spectral model to use , as a wide variety of different spectral models often fit equally well ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this has led to two classes of models being developed to fit the spectra during the soft state : the _ eastern _ model @xcite comprised of a disk blackbody and a weakly comptonized blackbody ; and the _ western _ model @xcite comprised of a single - temperature blackbody from the boundary layer and comptonized emission from the disk .",
    "in contrast , the hard state is dominated by a hard component , with the addition of a soft component which can either be a blackbody or a disk blackbody  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given the spectral ambiguities , color - color diagrams have been most frequently used to describe the behavior of nsxrbs .",
    "in fact , these sources are classed as either atoll or z sources depending on the shape they trace out on the color - color diagrams @xcite .    nevertheless , a recent study by @xcite using _ rxte _ spectra of the transient sources aql  x@xmath61 and 4u 1608@xmath652 has provided progress on the ` correct ' choice of spectral model .",
    "these authors test all the commonly used models and find that during the soft state the only model where the measured temperature follows the luminosity as @xmath12 is the one comprised of two thermal components , a disk blackbody and a single - temperature blackbody , in addition to a broken power - law . in this case , both the thermal components follow @xmath13 .",
    "this provides compelling physical motivation to use such a model , which can be interpreted as emission from the accretion disk and from a small boundary layer .",
    "however , the bandpass of _",
    "rxte_/pca is restricted to above @xmath83 kev , while the temperature of these components lies below 3 kev .",
    "this can lead to inaccuracies in modeling , and these findings should be confirmed by an instrument such as xrt with lower energy coverage .",
    "how these sources progress around their tracks on the color - color diagram , and what drives the changes , is still a matter of debate .",
    "recently , the transient source xte  j1701@xmath6462 has shown some unique properties which have important ramifications .",
    "it displayed both z and atoll tracks , with the z tracks ( both cyg - like and sco - like ) occurring when the source was at its highest luminosity and evolving into an atoll track as it decreased in luminosity @xcite .",
    "while it has long been known that z sources are more luminous than the atoll sources , this is the first time a single source has been seen to evolve from a z to an atoll , indicating that mass accretion rate must drive the overall shape of the color - color diagram .",
    "nevertheless , it still remains unclear as to what drives the state changes on the z or atoll track .",
    "@xcite suggest that the accretion disk evolves from a thin disk to a slim disk , while others have previously suggested that small changes in mass accretion rate change the source state though there is disagreement as to which direction along the z track mass accretion rate increases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , we do notice the z - track apparent in the figure , especially for the bottom panel which shows the hard x - ray band vs. @xmath15 . particularly notable is the fact that the fb observations correlate with the brightest nuv observations , and the hb observations correlate with some of the dimmest nuv observations .",
    "a similar trend was noted with 7 simultaneous observations using _ ginga _ and _ iue _",
    "those authors concluded that the nuv flux is brightest on the fb and dimmest on the hb .",

    "figure  [ fig : coloruv ] shows the hard and soft x - ray color vs. the @xmath15 flux density . although there is no strong correlation between the soft x - ray color and the nuv , there is a strong anticorrelation between the hard x - ray color and the nuv .",
    "that is , as the hard x - ray color decreases , the nuv flux increases and vice - versa .",
    "this anticorrelation drives the apparent correlation between nuv flux and z - track location observed by @xcite : the fb has the softest x - ray color and highest nuv flux , and the hb has a harder x - ray color and lower nuv flux .",
    "however , our complete coverage of the z - track of cyg  x-2 reveals that it is the hard color , not the position along the z - track , that is anticorrelated with the nuv flux .",

    "fitting to the functional form @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the bat rate measured in @xmath257 , we find @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "this strong correlation shows that the hard x - ray rate is dominated by the spectral index in the 2.5 - 10 kev band  a steeper spectral index yields a softer color and a lower hard x - ray rate .",
    "we have also confirmed that the bat rate also depends on the xrt rate in the 4.5 - 10 kev band , although the hard color is the dominant driver .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : colorbat ] shows the @xmath15 flux density against the bat rate . as with the @xmath15 flux density and the hard x - ray color ,",

    "there is no indication that the nuv flux varies along the hb .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the observed anticorrelation with a simple model in which the nuv emission is hard x - ray emission reprocessed by the accretion disk .",
    "we discuss these implications in section  [ sec : discussion ] .      as described in section  [ sec : intro ] , the spectral evolution of sources along their z track is of great interest , and it is still not entirely clear as to the mechanism that drives these spectral changes .",
    "cyg  x-2 has been the focus of several previous investigations into z track spectral evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note that these temperatures are significantly lower than seen by the previous spectral studies of cyg  x-2 discussed above .    in order to address this issue , we searched for any _ rxte _ observations that were simultaneous with any of our xrt observations .",
    "we found that our _ swift _ observation 002 , orbit 1 was overlapping with _ rxte _ observation 93443 - 01 - 01 - 15 .",
    "the xrt observation was performed on 2008 - 07 - 02 from 23:26 to 23:46 , whereas the _ rxte _ observation ran from 23:00 to 23:38 on the same date .",

    "] to the _ rxte_spectrum in the 3 - 23 kev band , we find @xmath269  kev and @xmath270  kev , similar to what has been observed in previous studies of cyg  x-2",
    ". the higher energy coverage of _",
    "rxte_/pca is much better suited to constrain these thermal components which have a peak energy of @xmath271 and @xmath272 respectively .    to test the source of this discrepancy",
    ", we have fit the xrt and _ rxte _ spectra jointly in the 0.6 - 23 kev range .",
    "we tie all model parameters in the absorbed two thermal component model between the two data sets .",
    "we also add a constant factor to allow for any absolute flux calibration mismatch .",
    "the resulting spectral fit is shown in figure  [ fig : jointspec ] , and is clearly a bad fit , with a reduced @xmath17 of 3.5 .",
    "the best - fitting model returns temperatures consistent with the parameters we find when fitting the _ rxte _ data alone , and the _ spectra match nicely where they overlap in the 3 - 10 kev range_. however , there are large residuals present below 3 kev . after trying a wide range of other models ( including combinations of disk blackbody , blackbody , power - law and comptonization ) we were unable to find a good fit .",
    "allow @xmath273 to float as a free parameter did improve the fit , but not to an acceptable level , and also returned a very low value ( @xmath274 ) .    by fitting the xrt data alone",
    "we are able to minimize the residuals below 3 kev .",
    "however , an extrapolation of the xrt spectrum to higher energies significantly underpredicts the hard x - rays , as shown in figure  [ fig : xtrapol ] . in general , the 10 - 20 kev spectrum of nsxrbs can be well described by a 2 - 3 kev blackbody  @xcite .",
    "the xrt fit is dominated by the spectral shape of the soft x - rays , where the response function peaks .",
    "therefore , the fit to the xrt spectrum alone , in which the temperature of the blackbody component is grossly underestimated , can not be properly extrapolated to the 10 - 20 kev range .",
    "we have checked that the difference between the xrt and _ rxte _ spectra does not appear to be a cross - calibration issue between the two instruments . as a confirmation",
    ", we analyzed several near - simultaneous xte and _ rxte _ observations of the black hole candidate lmxb xte  j1817@xmath6330 during its 2006 outburst ( see * ? ? ? * for details on all _ swift _ observations ) .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt spectra of this object can be fit by a simple disk blackbody plus a power - law over a wide range in luminosity @xcite .",
    "when looking at near - simultaneous _ rxte _ observations , we find that apart from a slight offset in absolute flux calibration , the spectra have the same shape  the power - law index and disk temperature recovered from fitting them separately and jointly are consistent . in the case of the neutron star binary cyg",
    "x-2 , the spectral decomposition is much more complicated than that for black hole binaries .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the difficulties in using the xrt spectrum alone arises due to the multi - component spectrum of cyg  x-2 , rather than cross - calibration issues .",
    "a gaussian feature at around 1 kev has been reported by previous studies of cyg  x-2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and including a gaussian at around 1 kev in the model does improve the fit .",
    "the origin of such a spectral feature is unclear , but recently @xcite very briefly note that there is a complex line blend around 1 kev in their _ chandra _ gratings spectra , the study of which will be the focus of their future work .",
    "however , even with the inclusion of a gaussian in our fit , from fitting the xrt data alone , we still recover low temperatures .",
    "therefore , we chose not to investigate the spectral evolution of cyg  x-2 along the z track with the current _ swift _ data set .      using long baseline observations of cyg  x-2 with _ rxte _ , @xcite detected a @xmath275 day period in the 1.5 - 12 kev light curve . at different times , a similar period of @xmath276 days has been detected in _",
    "vela 5b _ , _ ariel 5 _ , and _",
    "rxte_-asm data in addition to a shorter @xmath277 day period  @xcite .",
    "the present set of _ swift _ observations , spanning @xmath278 , is sufficiently long to confirm the ephemeris presented in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the _ swift _ coverage is not long enough to independently measure the ephemeris .",
    "the best - fit ephemeris from @xcite is : @xmath279 figure  [ fig : phased ] shows the phased light curve using this ephemeris for cyg  x-2 for two xrt energy ranges ( 0.6 - 2.5 kev ; 4.5 - 10 kev ) , bat x - rays ( 14 - 24 kev ) , and _ uvw2_. the count rate in each energy band has been scaled to the same amplitude , and offset for clarity .",
    "the true fractional amplitude for each energy range is 55% ( 0.6 - 2.5 kev ) ; 60% ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) ; 96% ( 14 - 24 kev ) ; and 65% ( _ uvw2 _ ) .    the phased light curve for the soft x - rays ( 0.6 - 2.5 kev ; red diamonds ) shows that the period and zero - point for the ephemeris , which was measured over 13 years ago , are well - matched to the current data set .",
    "although there is significant variability in addition to the underlying periodicity , we observe a maximum at a phase of 0.5 and a minimum at a phase of 1.0 .",
    "the minimum is consistent with previous observations , although we do not observe a less prominent secondary minimum at a phase of 0.5  @xcite .",
    "the periodicity is most prominent in the soft ( 0.6 - 2.5 kev ) x - rays , and is less prominent in the harder ( 4.5 - 10 kev ; green circles ) x - rays , and is not apparent in either the bat x - rays ( 14 - 24 kev ; blue squares ) or _ uvw2 _ ( magenta triangles ) data .    while the @xmath275 day period is readily apparent in the present soft x - ray data , we have not been able to confirm the @xmath277 day period observed at different times by other satellites  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have suggested that the @xmath277 day and @xmath280 day periods are harmonics , with the @xmath277 day period as more stable . by studying cyg  x-2over a longer time baseline than @xcite , they find that the dominant period changes , and suggest that the long - term ephemeris is not the reliable clock of @xcite .",
    "our _ swift_data provides more evidence that the dominant period changes over time .",
    "in addition , as our present data is consistent with the ephemeris of @xcite , suggesting some long - term stability of this underlying mode .",
    "@xcite attribute the observed superorbital periodicity to precession of a tilted accretion disk observed from a relatively high inclination angle , while @xcite attribute it to a precessing warped accretion disk .",
    "our present observations are consistent with either interpretation : the accretion disk should dominate the spectrum in the soft x - rays , while the blackbody emission from the boundary layer dominates the bat x - rays .",
    "thus , we do not expect to observe this periodicity in the 14 - 24 kev range , which is dominated by blackbody emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied cyg  x-2 with a joint x - ray / nuv monitoring campaign , and concluded that the nuv emission is an indirect but superior measure of bolometric flux .",
    "they argue that the accretion disk is a better bolometer than our x - ray detectors because it is insensitive to bandpass effects . assuming the nuv emission is dominated by reprocessed hard x - ray emission , it is then a good proxy for the total x - ray flux . with seven simultaneous x - ray / nuv observations ,",
    "there was a hint that the uv continuum flux increases along the z track .",
    "they therefore conclude that @xmath0 increases along the z track from the fb through the nb to the hb .    however , our current observations tend to contradict the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "first , we observe a strong anticorrelation between the nuv flux and 14 - 24 kev bat x - ray flux , which is difficult to explain in the context of a simple reprocessing model .",
    "second , there is no evidence in the x - rays that the bolometric luminosity is increasing as the bat x - ray luminosity is decreasing .",
    "we observe no correlation between the xrt ( 0.6 - 10 kev ) flux and the bat flux , even after correcting for the observational phase .",
    "third , with 68 epochs of simultaneous nuv and x - ray observations of cyg  x-2 , we can demonstrate that the nuv does not vary monotonically along the z - track , but rather varies inversely with the bat x - ray emission and hard color .",
    "the observed anticorrelation is in stark contrast to the strong correlation observed between the nuv flux and the 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission observed for the bhxrb xte  j1817@xmath6330  @xcite .",
    "the most obvious difference between these two systems is the existence of the neutron star surface and boundary layer in cyg  x-2 which is not present in xte  j1817@xmath6330 .",
    "this issue is addressed in greater detail below .",
    "another difference is the observed energy range .",
    "we have newly analyzed the 14 - 24 kev bat observations of xte  j1817@xmath6330 , which was detected at the @xmath281 level during the first @xmath282 epochs .",
    "we have confirmed that the 2 - 10 kev flux detected with the xrt is a good proxy for the bat x - ray emission .",
    "the simple spectral decomposition of the bhxrb makes this possible : while the softer x - ray emission is dominated by flux from the accretion disk , this provides the seed photons for the hard comptonized component .",
    "it is this hard component that is reprocessed by the disk into the nuv emission that we observe .    as we have discussed in section  [ sec : spectral ] , the spectral decomposition of a nsxrb like cyg  x-2 is much more complicated .",
    "the hard x - ray emission above 10 kev is well described by a blackbody potentially from the ns boundary layer  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the emission from the boundary layer is not directly correlated with the softer emission from the accretion disk , and therefore the 2 - 10 kev flux is not a good proxy for the hard 14 - 24 kev bat flux in this case .",
    "it is this hard x - ray emission that fluoresces the iron line  @xcite and should be reprocessed into nuv emission .",
    "the more complicated spectral decomposition of the nsxrb explains why we see a different relationship between xrt - nuv and bat - nuv .",
    "however , it does not explain the anticorrelation between the bat and nuv flux .",
    "a possible explanation of the large difference between the nuv@xmath6hard x - ray correlation in cyg  x-2 and xte  j1817@xmath6330 is geometric .",
    "although we do not have any constraints on the inclination of xte  j1817@xmath6330 , there is a large amount of evidence that we are observing cyg  x-2 at a high inclination angle .",
    "first , the short duration dips in the x - ray light curve imply a high inclination angle  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the periodicity in the optical light curve has been fit with an ellipsoidal model which constrains the inclination angle @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "finally , the long period in the soft x - ray light curve can be attributed to the precession of a tilted accretion disk only if we are observing the source relatively edge - on  @xcite .    modeling the accretion disk atmosphere and corona of a nsxrb ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the atmosphere and corona expands as the disk is radiatively heated .",
    "as the corona expands , more of the reprocessed nuv flux will be scattered out of the line - of - sight of an observer at a high inclination angle .",
    "the effect of the scattering may be larger than the increase in reprocessed emission as the disk is heated by the hard x - rays .",
    "thus , we can observe an anticorrelation between nuv flux and bat x - rays in one source and a correlation in another depending on inclination angle .",
    "we can compare our present observations to those of the bhxrb gx339@xmath64 , which was observed simultaneously in the optical and x - rays  @xcite .",
    "they observe an anti - correlation between the softer x - rays ( 1 - 13 kev ) and the optical , which is qualitatively different than observed for the nuv / x - ray observations of both cyg  x-2  ( uncorrelated ) and xte  j1817@xmath6330  ( correlated ) .",
    "however , the hard x - rays ( 13 - 20 kev ) were observed to have a significantly different behavior , in that they were slightly _ correlated _ with the optical emission .",
    "as gx339@xmath64 is observed at a relatively low inclination angle  @xcite , these observations are generally consistent with our geometric interpretation",
    ".    there are some remaining issues with this simple picture .",
    "the dips in the x - ray light curves occur primarily in the fb when the nuv emission is brightest .",
    "this may be explained by a cooling and condensing corona which begins to clump as it cools .",
    "the dips would then be a signature of this cool , clumpy corona . when the corona is heated and starts to puff up along the nb and hb , we scatter more nuv emission but the soft x - rays are no longer absorbed .",
    "another issue is that the boundary layer could potentially be blocked by the high inclination .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained long _ chandra _ gratings spectra of cyg  x-2 throughout the z track .",
    "they find a variety of broad emission lines in the spectra , and discovered that the line fluxes increase along the z track ( lowest on the hb , highest on the fb ) .",
    "they suggest that this implies the average heating luminosity of the accretion disk therefore increases from hb to nb to fb .",
    "however , if the line emission is not fluorescent , but rather recombination emission , we may only be able to see the lines when the heating and ionization level of the gas is reduced .",
    "further work will have to be done to fully develop this model .",
    "another possible explanation of the nuv@xmath6hard x - ray anti - correlation is given by the spectral modeling of @xcite , applied to several z - track nsxrbs . using frequency resolved spectroscopy to decompose the spectral components  @xcite , they were able to separate the component varying on s - ms timescales , which has a harder spectrum and is consistent with the boundary layer , from the stable component , which has a softer spectrum and is consistent with the accretion disk . at the hb / nb transition",
    ", the geometry of the accretion flow appears to change , and we begin to lose the clear distinction between the boundary layer and the accretion disk . at the fb , the thickening accretion disk may encompass the whole ns .    in this model , as the geometry changes over the z - track , the nature of the reprocessed emission will also change . as the source goes down the nb to the fb and we lose sight of the boundary layer , the hard x - ray flux decreases . at the same time , we observe more of the thickening accretion disk , and as this is the source of the reprocessed emission the nuv flux will increase .",
    "this model may also be consistent with the interpretation of the line fluxes by @xcite , and an increase of @xmath0 over the z - track .",
    "furthermore , in this model the boundary layer is still visible in the hb / nb , in spite of the large inclination angle .    as discussed above ,",
    "the present observations are a challenge to the simple interpretation of @xcite where @xmath0 increases monotonically along the z - track of cyg  x-2 from hb - nb - fb .",
    "if changes in @xmath0 lead directly to changes the the temperature of the blackbody component , as may be suggested by some models  @xcite , then it may be that @xmath0 increases as the hard color increases .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that z sources have roughly constant @xmath0 , but that different mechanisms , possibly related to the size of the boundary layer and inner disk radius , are responsible for changing the spectrum along the z - track .",
    "the model of @xcite , with a thickening accretion disk that encompasses the ns boundary layer , is nominally consistent with many of these interpretations . without sufficient spectral coverage of the hard x - rays in the 10 - 20 kev range to consistently track the blackbody component ,",
    "our present observations are insufficient to improve on the present uncertain state of affairs .    the question of whether viewing geometry or a thickening accretion disk is the source of the anticorrelation between nuv and hard x - ray flux is easily testable with further observing campaigns of sources at different inclination angles .",
    "unfortunately , most known nsxrb systems are too extincted in the nuv for such a study .",
    "however , other sources such as 4u  0614 + 09 have sufficiently low column density and large variability to be good targets for follow - up work .",
