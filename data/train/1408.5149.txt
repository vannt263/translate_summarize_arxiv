    "in this work we are interested in studying regularity of solutions of @xmath4$},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath5 the kernel @xmath6 is comparable to the fractional laplacian of order @xmath7 and it is non necessarily symmetric . as it was discussed in a previous paper @xcite , the odd part of the kernel brings drift terms after rescaling the equation .",
    "that is the reason why the drift term @xmath8 is included above .",
    "contrasting to the second order case , where the lower order drift might be absorbed by estimates proven for pure second order equation at sufficiently small scales , in our case the drift remains comparable to the diffusion as the scales go to zero , making it critical .",
    "this type of equations appear naturally when studying stochastic control problems ( see @xcite ) , ergodic control problem ( see @xcite ) and economic applications ( see @xcite ) , in which the the random part is given by a purely jump process , which is most of the time non necessarily symetric .",
    "the particular concave case can be seen as a one - player stochastic game , which at each step he can choose a strategy to minimize the expected value of some fixed function evaluated at the first exit point of a given domain . in the local case ( @xmath9 )",
    "this problem was first studied independently by l. evans and n. krylov ( see @xcite , @xcite and also the recent proof by l. caffarelli and l. silvestre in @xcite ) .",
    "they obtain @xmath10 a priori estimates and therefore the existence of classical solutions by the continuity method .",
    "l. caffarelli and l. silvestre proved in @xcite that solutions of the elliptic problem @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is a concave operator with smooth kernels , are @xmath2 .",
    "it relies on the theory of viscosity solutions developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the regularity obtained is enough to evaluate the operator in the classical sense .",
    "moreover , the estimates obtained are independent of the order of the equation and extends the theory to the classical case .    a recent improvement of the previous work , done by j. serra @xcite , allowed to remove the smoothness condition for symmetric kernels in order to prove @xmath2 estimates .",
    "it proceeds by a compactness argument that blows - up the solution , reducing the problem to a lioville type of result .",
    "regularity for parabolic nonlocal equations has been studied by the authors in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in which hlder estimates are proven for general equations like with a non zero right hand side .",
    "recent advances include the work of j. serra @xcite for @xmath12 estimates with rough kernels ; and the work of t. jin , and j. xiong , @xcite for higher order , optimal schauder estimates in the linear case .",
    "we extend the ideas of @xcite to the parabolic nonlocal case to prove the desired @xmath2 interior regularity . the order @xmath13 is assumed at least one in order for the drift to be at most comparable with the diffusion . on the other hand , for @xmath14 $ ] , the @xmath12 estimates established in @xcite already give classical solutions .",
    "in contrast with the classical theory , where drift terms might be absorbed by estimates proven for pure second order equations at sufficiently small scales , our operator keeps the drift comparable to the diffusion as the scale go to zero providing new challenges .",
    "we assume the boundary data to be at least differentiable in time .",
    "this is way to ensure that the solution is @xmath12 in time in the interior .",
    "keep in mind that for general boundary data one can not expect @xmath12 regularity in time , even for the fractional heat equation , an example is discussed in @xcite . whenever a weaker condition on the boundary data implies @xmath12 regularity in time in the interior",
    "remains an open question .",
    "here is our main theorem .",

    "we introduce the family of operators we are considering , the notion of viscosity solution and recall some properties .",
    "we also state some previous results that we need for the rest of this work .",
    "we use the concavity of the non - linearity in section [ eqlu ] to determine an equation for the average of a given solution , in particular we get an equation for the fractional laplacian . in section [ estimateforlap ]",
    "we use the previous equation to obtain a weak @xmath23 estimate on the laplacian of the solution .",
    "finally in section [ further ] we prove a diminish of oscillation lemma for the fractional laplacian which implies our main theorem .",

    "given the scaling properties of linear operators with non symmetric kernels discussed in @xcite and @xcite , it is reasonable enlarge the family of linear operators to include ( classical ) drift terms . in this sense",
    "lets introduce the following notation where the time variable has been omitted as it is irrelevant for the computation : @xmath29 initially we may consider kernels bounded from above and away from zero : @xmath30 the drift comes not only from the term @xmath31 but also from the odd part of the kernel after rescaling .",
    "we assume that they are controlled in the following way : @xmath32 we denote by @xmath33 the family of all linear operators with the two conditions given above and suppress some its parameters in the notation to follow whenever they are clear from the context , usually we write just @xmath34 .",
    "sufficient regularity / integrability to evaluate @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "more regular kernels can be considered in order to prove higher regularity estimates .",
    "this corresponds to the initial approach taken in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in order to use integration by parts techniques to control rough oscillations of the boundary data of the solution .",
    "this work follows uses the same technique for which we define the family @xmath38 such that for each kernel , @xmath39 such that for each kernel , @xmath40 , a non linearity @xmath0 is given by a function @xmath41\\times\\r^\\cl\\to \\r$ ] such that , @xmath42 @xmath0 is considered to be elliptic if it is increasing in @xmath43 .",
    "we recall some definitions pertaining to viscosity solutions @xmath16 for the equation @xmath48 . a test function @xmath49 needs to be sufficiently smooth / integrable about the contact point where the equation is tested . moreover",
    ", qualitative properties as the continuity of @xmath50 , require for the tail of @xmath16 to be at least continuous in time in the following integrable sense .",

    "the definition of @xmath16 being a viscosity _ sub _ solution to @xmath69 in @xmath64 $ ] is done similarly to the definition of super solution replacing contact from below by contact from above and reversing the last inequality .",

    "several qualitative results for viscosity solutions of our parabolic equations such as the stability , a comparison principle and the existence of ( viscosity ) solutions have been stablished in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
