    "photo - carrier generation and the associated photocurrent is a subject of intensive studies in condensed matter physics and its applications .",
    "for example , the excitation spectrum of photocurrent together with the optical absorption spectrum offers a powerful tool to investigate the electronic states in bulk solids .",
    "namely , the absorption can occur both by the excitons , i.e. , the bound states of electron and hole , and electron - hole continuum , while the photocurrent can be carried only by the latter , as the exciton is a charge neutral object and can not contribute to the current . by increasing the external electric field for the photocurrent ,",
    "the excitons split into electrons and holes and begins to contribute to the photocurrent . in solar cells , the external electric field is generated by the p - n junction , where the electrons and holes feel the potential gradient in the opposite directions and are separated  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional view of the photocurrent discussed above , the shift current in noncentrosymmetric systems has been attracting intensive interest  @xcite . in this phenomenon",
    ", since the system itself has a fixed `` direction '' , the light irradiation alone can produce the d.c .",
    "current without the external electric field .",
    "one might think that the internal electric field plays a similar role to that of the external one .",
    "however , the situation is much more subtle . due to the periodicity of the crystal potential",
    ", there is no macroscopic potential gradient .",
    "microscopically , the band structure has certain symmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 due to the time - reversal symmetry @xmath2 ( @xmath0 is the crystal momentum ) .",
    "namely , @xmath2-symmetry gives the relation @xmath3 with @xmath4 represents the up ( down ) spin .",
    "therefore , it is highly nontrivial whether the excitation of electrons and holes contributes to the shift current .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry @xmath5 , however , opens the possibility of the berry phase of bloch wavefunction to be finite .",
    "( more precisely , one can choose the gauge of the bloch wavefunction where the berry phase connection is zero in the presence of both @xmath2 and @xmath5 symmetries , i.e. , no berry phase contribution to material properties . )",
    "it have been shown that , the shift current comes from the berry connection of the bloch wavefunction @xmath6 for conduction ( @xmath7 ) and valence @xmath8 ) bands  @xcite .",
    "an important observation here is that the berry connection has the meaning of the intracell coordinate in the sense that the position @xmath9 of the wavepacket made from the bloch wavefunctions shifts proportionally by the berry connection .",
    "indeed , it is related to the polarization in ferroelectric materials  @xcite .",
    "this scenario for the ground state finds its generalization to the nonequilibrium steady state , where the continuous pump from the valence to conduction band occurs by the photo - excitation . in this case",
    ", the _ difference _ of the berry phase between the conduction and valence bands corresponds to the shift of the electron position induced by the transition , and contribute to the d.c .",
    "this is the picture of shift current , and hence is different from the transport current supported by the free carriers .",
    "it is more quantum mechanical origin , i.e. , can not be attributed to the motion of individual carriers , and is expected to be nonlocal in nature .",
    "therefore , the optical response of noncentrosymmetric photovoltaic systems to local photo - excitation is nontrivial .",
    "to study the shift current due to the local photo - excitation , in this paper , we consider a noncentrosymmetric non - interacting fermion chain as a basic model that exhibits shift current .",
    "as we ignore the coulomb interaction of electrons , our model has no internal bias due to the ferroelectric polarization , therefore , no photocurrent from the conventional mechanism similar to photoconductors .",
    "we study the model by a nonequilibrium green s function technique used to study nonequilibrium phenomena in semiconductors  @xcite and in organic solids  @xcite ; the details of the method are elaborated in appendices . by applying the method ,",
    "we numerically study the shift current induced by the local photo - excitation using the fermion chain up to @xmath10 sites .",
    "although there are no potential gradient , we find that a finite photocurrent appears in this model .",
    "furthermore , we find that the locally excited shift current in the fermion chain behaves in a distinct manner from the photocurrent in photoconductors and in p - n junctions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] .",
    "in particular , we find that the magnitude of shift current does not depend on the position of the photoexcitation . this is a contrasting feature to the conventional case , in which the current is suppressed for the photoexcitation at the center of the chain .",
    "this is an interesting feature that experimentally distinguishes the shift current from the conventional photocurrent .",
    "furthermore , this is an advantageous feature for application to highly efficient optoelectronic devices .",
    "we also find that the magnitude of photocurrent does not change by increasing the width of the bonds excited . as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results : lightwidth ] , we discuss that this is likely to be a consequence of high carrier density excited by light .",

    "site fermion chain with bond alternation and staggered potential .",
    "the chain is coupled to the leads at each end .",
    "the incident light excites @xmath11 sites of the chain at @xmath12 .",
    "( b ) floquet bands of the fermion chain in the bulk limit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "see the text for details . ]    to study the effect of local photo - excitation in noncentrosymmetric systems , we consider rice - mele model  @xcite coupled to leads ( electrode ) at each end and with monochromatic incident light [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] ; the light is taken into account as the time - dependent electric field .",
    "the hamiltonian for the chain is given by @xmath14 where the first term is the rice - mele hamiltonian , @xmath15 and the second term is the interaction with the incident light , @xmath16 here , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the electron at the @xmath19th site ; @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the uniform ( staggered ) hopping between the nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath22 is the staggered potential . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ha ] ) , @xmath23 is the frequency of the light and @xmath24 is the amplitude of vector field . here ,",

    "the sum @xmath25 is over consecutive @xmath11 sites centered at @xmath12 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] .    in periodically driven systems , there are no eigenstates as in the time - independent hamiltonians . however , according to the floquet theory  @xcite , one can define similar eigenstates for the periodically driven hamiltonian called floquet states . in the floquet theory ,",
    "in addition to the bands that consists of the eigenstate of time - independent hamiltonian , we consider the side bands of the original band with the energy shift of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ] . when the chain is exposed to light",
    ", it gives the mixing term between the side bands with different @xmath28 ; the leading order contribution from the light comes in as the mixing between two neighboring subbands ( subbands with the indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "therefore , to take into account of the leading order contributions from the light , in the subsequent calculations , we focus on the bands with indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands and ignore all others ( [ sec : computation ] ) .    to study the nonequilibrium transport phenomena in the rice - mele model , the photocurrent from the local excitation is studied using a nonequilibrium green s function theory  @xcite .",

    "site fermion chain with bond alternation ( @xmath32 ) and staggered potential ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the figure shows the dependence of the photocurrent on the location of incident light ( @xmath34 ) for different widths of light ( @xmath11 ) . ]    in this section , we study the shift current induced by the local excitation by light .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdchain ] shows the light - position dependence of the shift current by the local excitation at @xmath34 for @xmath10 .",
    "the three different lines correspond to different @xmath11 , the number of bonds we shine the light onto [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] .",
    "the results show that the shift current by the local excitation is almost independent of @xmath35 . besides , the shift current is symmetric with respect to @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 . for later convenience",
    ", we here define the `` symmetric '' and `` asymmetric '' components of the photocurrent by @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . by calculating @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] , we indeed find that @xmath41 , which is below the numerical precision . hence , our results show that the symmetric part of the photocurrent is dominant in the rice - mele chain .",
    "this is a contrasting feature from what is expected in the conventional mechanism in p - n junctions , by which the photocurrent is borne by charged quasi - particles . in p - n junctions ,",
    "the photocurrent is essentially an interfacial phenomenon . at the interface ( or surface ) , a potential gradient occurs due to the nonuniform structure . due to this potential gradient , when an electron - hole pair is created by light , the electron and hole drift toward opposite directions , resulting in a net charge current . in the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , the junction of the chain and the lead plays the role of the interface . therefore , in this mechanism , @xmath42 is expected to increase as we approach the edges .",
    "besides , if the carriers are generated close to the edge , we expect that the excited carriers can escape to the electrodes easily , before being scattered back into the valence band .",
    "hence , the current is expected to be larger at the ends of the chain than in the center .",
    "another important feature is the symmetry .",
    "although there is no potential gradient in the bulk , in principle , a finite photocurrent can appear from the conventional mechanism when the position of the light is sufficiently close to one of the edges .",
    "this is a mechanism similar to p - n junctions where the potential gradient appears due to the interface . if this mechanism is dominant , for a centrosymmetric chain ( or if the effect of broken inversion symmetry is negligible ) , the photocurrent from the local excitation is expected to be antisymmetric . on the contrary , if the photocurrent is induced by the bulk effect , e.g. , anomalous photovoltaic effect , then the @xmath35 dependence of the photocurrent is expected to be independent of the position of light for a sufficiently long chain , with possibly some effect of the surface near the edges , i.e. , they are ( almost ) symmetric .",
    "therefore , we expect the light - position dependence of the locally excited photocurrent reflects the microscopic mechanism of the photocurrent ; @xmath40 represents the contribution of the edges , e.g. the photocurrent by the conventional mechanism at the edge , while @xmath43 reflects the bulk effect such as the anomalous photovoltaic effects or shift current .",
    "these observations imply that the symmetric feature of the photocurrent with respect to @xmath35 reflects the unconventional photocurrent in the noncentrosymmetric chains , namely , the shift current . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we call the symmetric photocurrent `` shift current '' .",
    "our result in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] indicates that shift current is the dominant source of the photocurrent in rice - mele chain . to compare the result of rice - mele model with a model with no shift current",

    "another point to be noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] is the @xmath11 dependence of the shift current . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] , the induced shift current appears to be roughly the same for all @xmath11 .",
    "naively , the photocurrent is expected to be proportional to the amount of the photon energy absorbed by the chain , therefore , proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "our results , however , show that there is nearly no dependence of the induced current on @xmath11 . in our calculation ,",

    "the lower limit @xmath58 roughly corresponds to the band gap @xmath60 , while the peak corresponds to an @xmath23 which a subband of the conduction band perfectly overlap with that of the valence band , @xmath61 .",

    "figure  [ fig : omega_dep](b ) shows the @xmath47 dependence of the shift current with @xmath48 and @xmath63 at @xmath57 . for most values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the results of shift current show almost no dependencies to @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "some finite size effect is seen at @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath47 sensitive behavior around @xmath64 is likely to come from the sparse density of states in the center of the band . in the floquet theory",
    ", the effect of light primarily appears around the crossing of two bands with different floquet indices @xmath28 . in our model with @xmath52 , it is around the crossing of the conduction band with @xmath30 and valence band with @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) ; the two bands touch at their edge for @xmath66 , and crosses at the center of the bands for @xmath67 . as",
    "the density of states is relatively sparse at the center of the band than at the edges , the discreteness of the energy levels due to the finite length become more evident at the band center .",
    "however , the @xmath47 dependence at @xmath64 also appears to be converged for the chains we used here ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the result indicates that , for a sufficiently long chain , there seems to be almost no @xmath11 dependence .",
    "furthermore , from the @xmath23 dependence , it seems the @xmath11 independent behavior has less to do with the microscopic structure of the wave functions , e.g. , berry connection . according to the floquet theory ,",
    "as the effects of light have much smaller energy scale than other parameters , the effect of light on the electrons appears primarily around the band crossing point , where @xmath68  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath69 is the energy eigenstate of the valence band with wavenumber @xmath70 , and the @xmath71 being that of conduction band [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ] .",
    "as the crossing point changes by changing @xmath23 , if the behavior reflects the microscopic structure of the electronic states , e.g. , berry phase , then it is natural to expect @xmath23 dependence .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the @xmath11-independent behavior is related to the mechanism of the shift current .        from this observation ,",
    "the @xmath11-independent behavior is likely to come from the fact that a large number of carriers are excited in the conduction band . to show this",
    ", we here consider a quasi - classical model schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi_classic ] .",
    "the model consists of valence band , conduction band , and the lead(s ) as shown in fig .",

    "for the noncentrosymmetric chain , the result shows a rapid increase of the carrier density below @xmath91 and a saturation to @xmath92 above that . in coincidence with the saturation of the carrier density",
    ", the photocurrent also shows saturation above @xmath91 .",
    "these features are consistent with the above mechanism for the @xmath11-independent behavior of the shift current .      in this section ,",
    "we study the current - voltage characteristic of the chains with shift currents by applying the external bias to the leads on the both sides . in our calculation , however , we find no current dependence on the external voltage within the numerical precision , if the bias is smaller than the charge gap ( not shown ) .",
    "this is a natural consequence as the chain have no density of states at the fermi level .",
    "as the carriers have higher energy than the bias , the effuluence of carriers to the leads is not affected by the change of electron distribution in the leads , which only takes place close to the fermi level .",
    "our results presented in fig .  [ fig : bdchain ] show that a large shift current can be induced in a ferroelectric chain by local excitation . in the clean limit of a fermion chain",
    ", our result implies that the photocurrent in bulk photovoltaic materials can be robustly transported through the material for a long distance without decaying .",
    "this sheds light on to the potential realization of a highly efficient photovoltaic device using ferroelectric insulators  @xcite .",
    "an important point related to the robustness of the current is the effect of impurities . in experiments ,",
    "the impurities often suppress electric current . in one - dimensional systems ,",
    "the fermions are susceptible to anderson localization .",
    "if the localization occurs , the current is likely to be suppressed at the scale of the localization length , i.e. , no d.c .",
    "current is transported for the chains much longer than the localization length .",
    "therefore , we expect the shift current to decay by the length scale of localization when a light is shined onto only a part of the chain .",
    "in addition to the localization , another potential cause of the dissipation is the inelastic scattering by phonons .",
    "the inelastic scattering may contribute to the decay of shift current , limiting the distance the current is transmitted .",
    "study on the effect of electron - phonon scattering to the shift current is left for future works .",
    "in this paper , we theoretically studied the shift currents from local excitation by light . considering a noncentrosymmetric insulating fermion chain",
    ", we studied the dependence of shift current on the position of excitation . by applying a non - equilibrium green s function theory in [ sec : model ] , we show that the local excitation in the noncentrosymmetric chain induces photocurrent that is almost independent of the position of excitation and is symmetric to the location of light ( @xmath35 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdchain ] .",
