    "we examine a system consisting of an oscillating neutrino propagating through a dense medium .",
    "this falls into the very broad class of problems in which a quantum system can not be considered closed or isolated , due to interaction of the system with an environment or heat bath .",
    "in particular we consider two - flavour neutrino oscillations in a medium such that the system - bath interactions do not distinguish the flavour of the neutrino .",
    "an example is the density matrix of a single neutrino undergoing @xmath0 oscillations embedded in an electron - positron plasma . in some sense",
    "this example is similar to an early universe environment , though lacking some features of a realistic physical scenario , such as neutrino pair processes and the inclusion of other neutrino flavours .",
    "another example in which flavour blind interactions are relevant is the case of @xmath0 oscillations of neutrinos coming from the core of a supernova . in this case , although the indices of refraction for @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be different due to loop graph effects , the collision rates for the neutrinos scattering from the medium of nucleons will be the same for the two flavours , to a good approximation .",
    "however , it is the coherence properties of the system that are most intriguing , and which are worth studying independently of the various circumstances in which they may arise .",
    "an analogue to the neutrino system is that of a double well coupled to a thermal bath , in which the neutrino flavour oscillations are replaced by oscillations from the left to the right side of the well .",
    "our work provides an analytic treatment of the distinctive behaviour that we noted previously in a numerical treatment of double well oscillations @xcite . since",
    "double well systems are of general interest in condensed matter physics @xcite , the type of behaviour we examine here may be expected to arise in various situations unrelated to neutrino physics .    as the medium can not distinguish the flavour of the neutrino",
    ", the only effect of collisions with particles in the medium is to change the value of the neutrino s energy ( and to entangle the neutrino with the environment ) .",
    "this is in contrast with active - sterile oscillations in which collisions may in some sense be thought of as measuring the flavour of the neutrino .",
    "it is the consideration of the neutrino energy variable , and the rapid energy changing collisional processes that is crucial , and when the average collision rate is much larger than average oscillation rate we find that a collective oscillation results @xcite .",
    "that is , for a neutrino in a thermally distributed mixture of momentum states , the oscillations are synchronised despite being momentum dependent in the absence of collisions .",
    "we stress that the novel synchronisation effect arises as a result of energy changing processes .",
    "in particular , the result is distinct from the synchronisation effect of ref.@xcite which results from non - linear feedback , as we consider here only linear dynamics .",
    "the evolution equations for the neutrino density matrix have been formulated in ref.@xcite for active - active oscillations , and ref.@xcite for active - sterile oscillations .",
    "these quantum kinetic equations ( qkes ) or bloch equations , take into account both coherent oscillation behaviour and potentially decoherent effects of interaction of the neutrino system with an environment .",
    "the qkes are essentially boltzmann equations , generalised to allow for quantal coherence between particle species .",
    "we choose to parametrise the neutrino density matrix as @xmath3,\\ ] ] with @xmath4    the qkes for a single neutrino undergoing elastic scattering in a medium which does not distinguish flavour are @xcite @xmath5 + { \\bf v}(k ) \\times { \\bf p}(k ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "that is , we consider in isolation a particular subset of the various processes that may affect the evolution of the neutrino density matrix .    for our considerations it should suffice to take the following form for the scattering rate , @xmath18 as this embodies the correct threshold behaviour , the reciprocity relation ( [ thermal ] ) and leads to the correct total transition rate .",
    "we have solved the qkes ( [ xyz ] ) numerically , and the results are presented in the graphs below , for various temperatures . for small temperatures , where the average time between collisions is much longer than the oscillation period , we have just the superposition of ( almost ) undamped precession rates at different frequencies . for moderate collisions rates we rapidly lose coherence in the neutrino system .",
    "this occurs simply because the oscillation modes are momentum dependent .",
    "collisional processes transfer quanta across the momentum states which quickly get out of phase , and hence result in a damping of the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "the most fascinating effect , however , is obtained for larger values of @xmath19 where the average time between collisions is much smaller than the oscillation period . in this limit",
    "we see a synchronisation of the oscillations of all the momentum states . here",
    ", the precession proceeds at at a rate determined by the thermal average of @xmath10 , and damping is eliminated as the rapid collisions force the momentum modes to stay in phase .",

    "when rapid scattering processes are flavour blind , a neutrino in a mixture of momentum states undergoes synchronised flavour oscillations .",
    "this collective , dissipationless behaviour has been demonstrated numerically and derived analytically . under these circumstances",
    "msw transitions become sharper as all momentum states go through the resonance together .",
