    "the comparison of such different regimes allows to gain a significant insight into the relation among invisible and luminous matter .",
    "galaxy groups can be regarded as systems intermediate between galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "they provide constraints through two different routes : as galaxy systems , through their internal properties ( velocity dispersion @xmath11 , radius @xmath12 , etc . ) ; as lss tracers , through their `` external '' properties ( abundance , clustering , fraction of grouped galaxies , etc . ) .",
    "groups therefore yield quite useful counterchecks to models based on galaxy and cluster data .",

    "many studies concentrated on _ _ c__ompact groups , a rather special case of the more general loose groups considered here .",

    "( 1996 ) .",
    "our group catalog is meant to be as homogeneous as possible to those previously published and well  studied .",
    "unfortunately , group properties are very sensitive to the details of the identification recipe ( e.g. , pisani et al .",
    "on the other hand , most of the actually available samples of loose groups were compiled following the same grouping criteria , the adaptive friends  of  friends ( fof ) algorithms introduced by huchra & geller ( 1982 , hg82 hereafter ; see also nolthenius & white 1987 , nw87 hereafter ) .",
    "still , group properties are systematically influenced by the user s choice of search parameters ( hg82 ; nw87 ; moore et al .",

    "this must be taken into account by a careful , self  consistent match of fof parameters among different catalogs .",
    "several authors ( nw87 ; mfw93 ; nkp94 ; nkp97 ; f95a ,  b ) used cosmological n  body simulations of dark matter models to calibrate the `` optimal '' fof algorithm . in the first place , this aims at obtaining the highest possible completeness and reliability of fof groups ( nw87 ; mfw93 ; f95a ,  b ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that this approach can then be reverted in order to constrain the models .",
    "once a grouping procedure is found successful , it is applied to real and simulated data , and outputs are self  consistently compared ( nw87 ; nkp94 ; nkp97 ) .",

    "1989 ; ramella et al .",
    "there , we show that many previously unexplained discrepancies among such analysis are essentially due to the different fof parameters adopted by different authors .",

    "we note that magnitudes in the cfa samples are not corrected for galactic extinctions , and redshifts are usually corrected for the solar motion with respect to the local group ( sometimes also for infall on the virgo cluster ) .",
    "in early catalogs , galaxy groups were identified `` by eye '' ( e.g. , de vacouleurs 1975 ) and/or in projection ( e.g. , turner & gott 1976 ) from angular galaxy catalogs .",
    "nowadays , groups are better identified by means of objective grouping procedures applied to galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "several such prescriptions have been suggested in the literature ( turner & gott 1976 ; materne 1978 , 1979 ; paturel 1979 ; tully 1980 , 1987 ; hg82 ; nw87 ; n93 ; pisani 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "we adopt the adaptive fof algorithms introduced by hg82 for several reasons .",
    "first , most loose group catalogs extracted from galaxy redshift surveys ( hg82 ; geller & huchra 1983 ; rgh89 ; maia et al .",
    "1989 ; n93 ; garcia 1993 ; pghr94 ; rpg97 ) are based on this technique , and we want to compare them with ours .",
    "second , fof algorithms are relatively faster and easier to implement than other objective grouping algorithms ( turner & gott 1976 ; materne 1978 , 1979 ; paturel 1979 ; tully 1980 , 1987 ; pisani 1993 , 1996 ) , lead to a unique output catalog for given input parameters , and do not rely on any a priori assumption regard to the geometrical shape of galaxy groups .",
    "third , fof algorithms are well  studied tools , as they have been repeatedly applied to numerical simulations of galaxy surveys .",
    "these have been either ( i ) cosmological n  body simulations ( nw87 ; mfw93 ; nkp94 , nkp97 ; f95a ,  b ) , where all six space and velocity coordinates are known in advance and allow for a self  consistent matching of `` real '' and fof groups , or ( ii ) geometrical monte  carlo simulations ( rgh89 ;",
    "rpg97 ) which accurately mimick the main lss features of a given data set and allow to assess the impact of lss on the group properties .",
    "all such simulations provided evidence that fof  identified objects indeed mostly correspond to physically real galaxy groups , though poor groups with only @xmath58 or @xmath59 members may be substantially contaminated ( rgh89 ; f95a ; rpg97 ) .",
    "no similar extensive countercheck on the other group  finding techniques has been reported yet .",
    "fourth , further and more direct evidence of the `` reality '' of fof groups was recently provided by direct observation of the neighbourhood of fof groups by ramella et al .",
    "( 1995a  b , 1996 ) , who also showed how the physical properties of fof  identified loose groups are a reliable estimate of those of the `` real '' underlying galaxy groups . to be fair",
    ", it should be noted that the hg82 recipe tends to include a high fraction of spurious members and/or groups ( nw87 ; f95a ,  b ) .",
    "however , the compilation of a catalog requires , in the first place , a high degree of completeness ; suspicious objects can still be discarded later on .",
    "the operational definition of a group is a number density enhancement in ( redshift ) space ( hg82 ; nw87 have a slightly different point of view ) .",
    "the algorithm can be thought of as a percolation technique , but truncated to a specified value @xmath60 of the connecting link @xmath61 : galaxies closer than @xmath60 are `` friends '' of each other , friendship is transitive , and an isolated set of ( at least 3 ) friends is what we call a galaxy group . in the ideal case of a luminosity  complete and volume  limited sample with @xmath62 galaxies , volume @xmath63 , average density @xmath64 , with no redshift distortions , groups",
    "would then be selected above a fixed number density threshold @xmath65 , given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the galaxy lf of the sample [ sect .",
    "[ sez : lfsf ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lf ] ) ] and all galaxies are brighter than the absolute magnitude completeness limit @xmath68 .      in practice , loose groups have usually been identified from apparent  magnitude  limited redshift surveys .",
    "this brings in two main complications : ( i ) strong radial _ _ r__edshift distortions due to peculiar motions , mainly induced by small  scale galaxy dynamics within the groups themselves , and ( ii ) distance _ _ s__election effects due to the difficulty of observing fainter galaxies at larger distances .",
    "neglecting the effect of strong spatial inhomogeneities ( lss ) , the expected number density of galaxies at a distance @xmath69 from us , brighter than @xmath70 in apparent magnitude and brighter than @xmath71 in absolute magnitude , is given by @xmath72 which increases with @xmath70 and decreases with @xmath69 .    to overcome effect ( ii ) , the strategy is to `` compensate '' the decrease in @xmath73 by allowing the links to be `` more generous '' at larger @xmath69 or fainter @xmath70 . to deal with effect",
    "( i ) , the spatial link @xmath61 is replaced by a transverse `` sky  link '' @xmath74 and a radial `` redshift  link '' @xmath75 .",
    "different authors proposed qualitatively different solutions to implement such a strategy ( hg82 ; nw87 ; see also gourgoulhon et al .",
    "1992 , n93 , garcia 1993 ; we refer to the original papers for details ) , involving also dynamical considerations about @xmath75 because of effect ( i ) .",
    "advantages and shortcomings of one recipe over another are discussed in nw87 , garcia ( 1993 ) and f95a ,  b.    we adopt the scaling recipe of hg82 , though with stricter normalizations .",
    "both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are normalized by @xmath76 and @xmath77 at some fiducial redshift @xmath78 .",
    "they are then scaled with @xmath36 as @xmath79^{-1/3}$ ] , where @xmath80 is the median redshift of the @xmath81-th pair of galaxies .",
    "galaxies are linked if their transverse and radial separations @xmath82 and @xmath83 satisfy @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the number density within groups at distance @xmath69 is @xmath86 which with the hg82 scaling @xmath87 yields @xmath88 we emphasize that the relation among @xmath65 and @xmath5 depends on the galaxy lf . also , the spherical symmetry of the `` volume of friendship '' implicitly assumed in the idealized eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0dn / n ] ) is broken by the actual , anisotropic definition of friendship through the two links @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "as previously pointed out , group properties sensitively depend on the chosen algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , we want to define group samples which may be directly compared  to / combined  with those previously published .",
    "we discuss here how to face this problem .",
    "we emphasize that here we concentrate on the question of how to `` match '' fof algorithms for different data sets .",
    "the complementary problem of how to calibrate the `` optimal '' ( if any ) fof algorithm for a given data set has been extensively discussed by other studies ( hg82 ; nw87 ; rgh89 ; mfw93 ; f95a , b ; nkp94 , nkp97 ) , and it is out of our scope .    according to hg82 , groups are selected above a density contrast @xmath65 _",
    "_ g__iven a priori .",
    "the physical justification is the hypothesis ",
    "requirement that galaxy groups correspond to dynamically bound matter overdensities , whose dynamical state is dictated by their density contrast @xmath89 , in turn related to the number density contrast @xmath65 , maybe through some mechanism of biased galaxy formation ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "unfortunately , one does not know exactly the value of the normalization of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0dn / n ] ) . due to the presence of lss ,",
    "this may vary by a factor of 2 from survey to survey , and fluctuates strongly even within the same galaxy survey ( eg .",
    ", de lapparent et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ; see also sect .",
    "[ sez : lfsf ] ) .",
    "fluctuations and uncertainties about the shape of the lf also have a ( slight ) effect on the @xmath5@xmath65 relation  ( [ eq : d0dn / n ] ) ( tb96 ; sect .",
    "[ sez : variability ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relation among the ( physically well  motivated ) _ _ m__ass density  contrast @xmath89 and the observatio _ _ g__alaxy number density ",
    "contrast @xmath65 , is still very uncertain ( e.g. , bower et al .  1993 ) .",
    "actually , the very existence of a universal value of @xmath90 , valid at any sufficiently large spatial scale , has been repeatedly questioned ( e.g. , coleman & pietronero 1992 ; baryshev et al .",
    "1994 ) and the debate on this point is still alive ( davis 1996 ; pietronero et al .",
    "1997 ) .    what normalizations should we adopt ? for",
    "the sake of clarity , let us first consider only data samples of the _ _ s__ame depth , but different galaxy lf .",
    "( we will discuss the effect of different depth , and of further sample  to  sample variations due to local lss features , later on . )",
    "the rgh89 group catalog in the cfa2 slices is normalized by @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath93 . with the galaxy lf adopted by rgh89",
    ", @xmath5 translates into @xmath94 .",
    "this very value may be regarded as an update of @xmath95 used by hg82 and based on theoretical considerations , enhanced by a factor 4 to account for the locally high density of the the great wall region within cfa2 slice where most of the groups reside ( ramella et al .",
    "1992 ; ramella , private communication ) .",
    "subsequent observational ( ramella et al .",
    "1995a - b , 1996 ) and theoretical ( f95a ,  b ) studies confirmed such values of @xmath10 and @xmath5 as `` optimal '' for the compilation of a group catalog , though different normalizations may be more appropriate in different contexts ( nw87 ; mfw93 ; n93 ; f95a ,  b ; nkp94 , nkp97 ) .",
    "we also note that the specific conclusions of most such works should be taken with caution , as ( i ) they do not always use the precise hg82 scaling for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and ( ii ) their observational sample is often the cfa1 survey , brighter and shallower than cfa2 and pps2 .",
    "( for a discussion of the effect of depth , see below . ) later , pghr94 and rpg97 used a slightly different @xmath96 , due to the higher density of cfa2 north and to their requirement @xmath97 .",
    "the galaxy lf of pps2 is still different , yielding further combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath65 . with our choice of @xmath67 ( sect .",
    "[ sez : lfsf ] ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99 yield @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , instead of the desired @xmath97 .",
    "the latter is only recovered if we adopt @xmath102 , substantially larger than @xmath5 used by rpg97 .",
    "this is consistent with the different normalizations suitable for pps2 , cfa2 slice , and cfa2 north ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , respectively ) and well within the lf normalization uncertainty .",
    "we are then led to the following question . in order to build group catalogs",
    "physically as similar as possible to each other , should they be compiled using ( the same link @xmath10 and ) the _ _ s__ame link @xmath5 , or the _ _ s__ame density threshold @xmath65 ?",
    "we emphasize that the parameter @xmath65 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0dn / n ] ) is customarily used only in order to _ _",
    "l__abel a given fof catalog .",
    "in fact , no such assumption is needed to _ _ i__dentify the groups , and one could as well use as label the @xmath5 parameter effectively used by the fof algorithm itself .",
    "moreover , the theoretically motivated mass overdensity @xmath89 is ideally referred to the mean mass density @xmath106 of the whole universe , and not @xmath107 averaged only over the considered sample .",
    "however , no matter whether the universal value of @xmath108 coincides with @xmath107 and whether it is known or not , for a given @xmath106 identical @xmath5 s will correspond to identical @xmath109 .",
    "so , though strong theoretical motivations suggest @xmath110 to be the relevant physical quantity , and suggest @xmath65 as its observational counterpart , on practical grounds it is more justified to relate the link normalization directly to @xmath5 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the issue of @xmath5 vs @xmath65 was considered also by maia et al .",
    "they compared fof groups in ssrs1 and in cfa1 , identified either with the same @xmath5 or with the same @xmath65 , and found that the median physical properties of the groups were more similar in the former case than in the latter .",
    "however , it is not clear how to interpret such result , since the two galaxy samples ssrs1 and cfa1 differ in depth and selection criteria .",
    "we can now discuss the case of data samples of _ _ d__ifferent depth , for which things are still slightly more complicated .",
    "for simplicity , we assume them to have the same parent lf .",
    "we adopt the schechter ( 1976 ) functional form @xmath111 . then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0dn / n ] ) above , constant @xmath112 requires @xmath113^{-1/3 } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "one way out of this technical difficulty ( tb96 ) is to choose a normalization location @xmath130 variable from sample to sample , and equal to ( i ) a constant fraction of the characteristic sample depth @xmath114 , or ( ii ) zero distance .",
    "the problem with ( i ) is to introduce a dependence on @xmath115 ( which also varies from sample to sample ) , while ( ii ) is technically delicate as eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrphi ] ) with @xmath131 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lf ] ) formally diverges for @xmath132 , but suitable limits can still be defined ( tb96 ) . in practice ,",
    "given the depth of the galaxy samples from which galaxy groups can be meaningfully identified , @xmath118 is already close enough to zero that simply keeping the same normalization location @xmath126 for samples of different @xmath70 introduces only a small inconsistency in the values @xmath5 and @xmath10 [ eq .  ( [ eq : d0d0 ] ) ] , largely overwhelmed by the other sources of uncertainty .",
    "all these complications , due to the nature of the fof grouping algorithm , would be avoided if group properties turned out to change little for reasonable variations of fof parameters .",
    "actually , rpg97 report that group properties are non  significantly sensitive to the choice of linking parameters over a wide range of @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry and the `` orthogonality '' of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the hg82 algorithm suggests @xmath5 to be directly related to the group size ( @xmath133 or @xmath134 ) , and @xmath10 to be directly related to the group velocity dispersion @xmath11 , possibly with some residual `` non  orthogonal '' dependence . since @xmath135 , any dependence of a given group property @xmath136 on @xmath5 or @xmath65",
    "is equally recovered if one plots @xmath136 against @xmath137 or @xmath138 . in summary ,",
    "even a substantial dependence of group properties on the links @xmath10 and @xmath5 , though not removed , might be missed or hidden by focusing attention only on the customary @xmath65 parametrization .    in order to test such effects on group properties",
    ", we built several arrays of group catalogs with different normalizations , and the same lf adopted for pps2 .",
    "the first array has given @xmath139 and variable @xmath140 @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , including the @xmath5 s used by rpg97 ( ramella , private communication ) and yielding @xmath152 @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath101 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , respectively , with our lf .",
    "the second array has given @xmath96 and variable @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "the third array is like the second one , but for @xmath169 . in figure  [ fig2medians]a",
    ", we plot the line  of  sight velocity dispersion @xmath11 ( medians ) against the redshift link @xmath10 .",
    "analogously , in figure  [ fig2medians]b , we plot the mean harmonic radius @xmath133 and mean pairwise member separation @xmath134 ( medians ) against the spatial link @xmath5 . in all cases ,",
    "we find strong , approximately linear correlations : @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "similar results also hold for groups in cfa2 north ( fig .",
    "[ fig2medians ] , rpg97 s data ) , in cfa1 ( nkp94 ; nkp97 ) , and in ssrs1 ( maia et al . 1989 , their table 5 ) .",
    "although rpg97 produce a figure with a decreasing trend of @xmath133 versus @xmath173 , they do not mention that this trend simply arises from the proportionality between median @xmath133 and @xmath5 ( which would have been obvious had they made a log  log plot ) .",
    "for all the above mentioned reasons , several of which are mainly practical , we prefer to parametrize a given fof algorithm by its @xmath5 and @xmath10 . in particular , we specify the threshold spatial separation used by the fof algorithm _ _ d__irectly in terms of @xmath5 , instead of through the density contrast ( hg82 ) or as a fraction of the mean inter galaxy separation ( nw87 ) .",
    "we then compute @xmath65 _ a _ posteriori through eq .",
    "( [ eq : d0dn / n ] ) , and interpret its value mainly as an approximate measure , rather than a precise parametrization , of density contrast .    [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     this seems to contradict the results of rgh89 .",
    "they found a significant difference among groups in different samples , namely @xmath174 in the cfa1 survey and @xmath175 in the cfa2 slice . from their figure  9",
    ", one sees that groups in the cfa1 survey and the cfa2 slice are located preferentially around @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "rgh89 correctly notice that this different location of the lss within the samples induces a significant physical difference among the groups in the two samples , those in the shallower sample being typically nearer to us and brighter .",
    "then , they argue that these sample  to  sample variations might also be responsible for the discrepancy in @xmath178 .",
    "however , rgh89 do not give an explanation why @xmath178 should be higher in one sample than in the other , and they reject the possibility that the discrepancy be induced by the fof grouping algorithm .",
    "( see also the discussion in maia et al .",
    "in fact , the difference between the groups in cfa1 and cfa2 slices could be due to a",
    "_ _ c__ombination of the different lss features present in the two galaxy samples and of the different radial scaling of the fof links adopted for the two samples .",
    "we recall that the links increase with @xmath69 and decrease with @xmath70 ( sect .",
    "[ sez : scaling ] ) .",
    "therefore , normalizing the links with the same @xmath5 and @xmath10 for both samples , but scaling them proportionally to @xmath179^{-1/3}$ ] ( different for the two samples ! ) as in rgh89 , at any given @xmath69 the links @xmath74 and @xmath75 will still be always more generous in the shallower sample than in the deeper one .",
    "but , if group properties are so directly related to @xmath74 and @xmath75 as suggested by sect .",
    "[ sez : normalization ] , then the relative location of lss features within the sample boundaries must _ _ a__lso be taken into account .",
    "e.g. , if the lss features lie at comparable distance in both samples , one would expect a higher @xmath178 in the shallower sample ( more generous links ) .",
    "but , if the lss features are very differently distributed in the two samples , they could be differently `` weighted '' by the adopted links .",
    "so , if lss features lie at a much greater distance ( more generous links ) in the deeper than in the shallower sample  as in the case for cfa1 and cfa2 slices  scaling up the links with @xmath69 might even overtake the effect of @xmath70 in @xmath128 .",
    "one would then expect a higher @xmath178 in the deeper sample  once more , as in the case for cfa1 and cfa2 slices .",
    "interestingly , one finds a link ratio @xmath180 , to be compared with @xmath181 , taking into account that groups are not only located precisely at @xmath182 and @xmath183 . in a sense , by modulating the properties of the groups according to distance , the fof links may either amplify or deamplify the sample  to  sample variations according to how the galaxy lss is arranged within the samples . on the other hand ,",
    "such effects will be reduced when samples of the same @xmath70 are compared using the same @xmath184 and @xmath185 , as we do here . in this case , all discrepancies would be purely due to the intrinsic sample  to  sample variations , i.e. a different amount and/or location of lss within the survey limits , but not further modulated by a different radial scaling of the links .",
    "considering medians or averages over the whole group distributions would further reduce the sample  to  sample discrepancies .",
    "related to the previous point , note the smooth curves in the @xmath36-@xmath136 scatter plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig6abcd][fig9ab ] ) . they were _ _",
    "n__ot obtained by fitting the observed distribution on the diagrams .",
    "they were obtained simply by replacing @xmath11 and @xmath133 by @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively , in all formulae defining internal properties . however , there is often a clear similarity of redshift dependence between the smooth , fof  induced curves and the ( upper envelopes , or median values of ) group internal properties .",
    "note also how the peaks in the @xmath188 histograms often correspond to denser region in the @xmath36@xmath136 plane ( projected onto the @xmath136 axis ) , in turn related with dense concentrations in redshift space ( e.g. , the peak at @xmath189 in fig",
    ".  [ fig1gal ] , [ fig3mem ] and [ fig4grp ] ) .    in summary , in pps2 as well as in other samples ( maia et al .",
    "1989 ; rgh89 ) , there seem to be a complex interplay among lss features , sample depth , fof algorithms , and group properties .",
    "disentangling these effects is a subtle matter , out of the scope of the present paper , and it is left for a future work ( trasarti  battistoni 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "this paper had one key aim : to build several large group samples ( @xmath190 groups ) in the southern galactic hemisphere from the pps galaxy survey , never previously analyzed in this way . such galaxy sample is considerably larger and/or deeper and/or wider than those used in most similar previous studies , so that our group catalog is one of the largest presently available .",
    "particular care was used in order to define group catalogs as homogeneous as possible to those previously published  in particular , the large group catalogs based on the cfa2 galaxy survey in the northern galactic hemisphere ( rgh89 ; rpg97 ) .",
    "such samples have the same depth as our sample pps2 , and comparable angular width , but different galaxy lf .",
    "group catalogs are customarily labelled by the redshift link @xmath10 and the effective density contrast threshold @xmath65 used to select the groups ( or , equivalently , the mean inter particle separation @xmath191 ) .",
    "however , to specify spatial separations , the parameter actually used by the fof algorithm is not @xmath65 , but rather the spatial link @xmath5 itself .",
    "the relations among these two parameters depends on the adopted galaxy lf and sample depth , so it differs from sample to sample .",
    "this leads to some ambiguity , and to several possibilities , which we discuss , about how to match our grouping algorithm to those used for the other samples . on one hand , and consistently with maia et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and rpg97 , we find strong , approximately linear correlations ( i ) between the redshift link @xmath10 and the ( median values of ) the velocity dispersion @xmath11 , and ( ii ) between the spatial link @xmath5 and the ( median values of ) the mean harmonic radius @xmath133 and mean pairwise member separation @xmath134 . even for individual groups ,",
    "the redshift dependence of @xmath133 and @xmath11 seems to be closely related to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . on the other hand , and",
    "consistently with rpg97 , group velocity dispersions ( spatial sizes ) are rather insensitive to the spatial link @xmath74 ( velocity link @xmath75 ) .",
    "all this suggests to regard @xmath5 and @xmath10 as the basic fof parameters , and interpret @xmath65 only as an estimate of the density contrast threshold .",
    "we adopt the normalizations @xmath96 and @xmath139 , as in rpg97 .",
    "the galaxy lf for pps2 has schechter parameter ( sty fit ) @xmath192 and @xmath193 , in good agreement with similar estimates .",
    "the sty technique does not allow to estimate the lf normalizations @xmath194 .",
    "we then adopt the value @xmath195 as determined by mhg94 for the cfa2 south sample , which is very similar to pps2 .",
    "the adopted normalizations and lf yield then @xmath196 . we test for the effect of galaxy lf on group properties .",
    "the main effect is connected to the relation between @xmath5 , @xmath65 , and @xmath194 , and the uncertainty on the latter . by replacing the @xmath65 parametrization with the @xmath5 parametrization , this problem is avoided .",
    "in fact , for given @xmath10 and @xmath5 , the residual net effect on group properties due to @xmath197 and @xmath116 is generally small : @xmath198-@xmath199 for all considered internal properties @xmath136 , and similarly for group positions ( tb96 ) and group clustering ( tbib97 ) .",
    "we also test for the effect of different redshift corrections .",
    "again , the effect is small , as expected for magnitude  limited samples .",
    "the spatial distribution of fof  identified loose groups in pps2 largely reproduce the lss features in the parent galaxy catalog .",
    "thus , galaxy loose groups can be usefully used as tracer of lss .",
    "analysis of group clustering in pps2 has been presented elsewhere ( tbib96 ) .",
    "properties of fof  identified loose groups selected from directly comparable ( in depth , selection criteria , sky coverage , etc . )",
    "parent samples are generally in good agreement , provided group are selected in a similar way .",
    "\\3 . however , there seems to be a complex interplay among the lss features in the galaxy sample , the sample depth , the fof grouping procedure , and the group properties .",
    "a more detailed assessment of this and the previous point will be presented elsewhere ( trasarti  battistoni 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "the large extent of the group catalog presented here is due to the depth , sky coverage , and high sampling density of the parent galaxy sample pps . the deep , high  density , and wide  angle surveys cfa2 and ssrs2",
    "have been completed already some years ago , and they should be made available in the future ( ramella , private communication ) .",
    "these samples are directly comparable to pps2 , and we hope that they will be suitably combined with it for future analysis .",
    "the group catalog presented here was built with this purpose in mind .",
    "much larger samples will be required for further , substantial improvement .",
    "in fact , the deeper surveys nowadays available are usually not well  suited to group analysis .",
    "selected surveys ( e.g. , fisher et al . 1995 ) contain preferentially late  type galaxies , thus biased against high density regions , and their infrared lf yields a sf rapidly decreasing with @xmath36 , in this way exhacerbating the scaling problem .",
    "very deep surveys , sparse samples ( e.g. , loveday et al . 1992 ) or narrow angle surveys ( e.g. , vettolani et al .",
    "1993 ) , add extra difficulties to this kind of study , as group identification require a sampling ratio as high as possible , and it is more difficult to identify groups near the survey edges .",
    "future surveys such as 2df ( colles & boyle 1998 ) , 6df ( see mamon 1996b ) , and sdss ( gunn & weinberg 1995 ) , will provide homogeneous galaxy samples ( 250000 in 2 slices by 1999 ; 90000 , near  ir selected , over the southern sky by 2002 ; 1000000 over half the northern hemisphere by 2004 , respectively ) that should provide considerably larger homogeneous catalogs of loose groups .",
