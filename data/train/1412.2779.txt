    "proteins are of paramount importance to living systems not only because of their role in providing the structural stiffness and rigidity to define the distinct shape of each living being , but also due to their functions in catalyzing cellular chemical reactions , immune systems , signaling and signal transduction .",
    "it is commonly believed that protein functions are determined by protein structures , including primary amino acid sequences , secondary alpha helices and beta sheets , and the associated tertiary structures .",
    "rigidity and flexibility are part of protein functions . since 65 - 90% of human cell mass",
    "is water , structural proteins , such as keratin , elastin and collagen , provide stiffness and rigidity to prevent biological material from flowing around .",
    "the prediction of protein flexibility and rigidity is not only crucial to structural proteins , but also important to membrane and globular proteins due to the correlation of flexibility to many other protein functions .",
    "protein functions are well known to correlate with protein folding , a process in which random coiled polypeptides assume their three - dimensional structures . although anfinsen s dogma @xcite has been challenged due to the existence of prions and amyloids , most functional proteins are well folded .",
    "the folding funnel hypothesis associates each folded protein structure with the global minimum of the gibbs free energy .",
    "unfolded conformations have higher energies and are thermodynamically unstable , albeit they can be kinetically favored .",
    "the understanding of the structure - function relationship of proteins is a central issue in experimental biology and is regarded by many to be the holy grail of computational biophysics .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to unveil the structure - function relationship in proteins .",
    "one approach to this problem is to design experiments from the evolutionary point of view to understand how evolutionary processes have led to various protein functions that strengthen the sustainability of live beings .",
    "the past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in gene sequencing .",
    "vast sequence databases are readily available for entire genomes of many bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes .",
    "new genomes are updated on a daily basis .",
    "the protein data bank ( pdb ) has also accumulated near one hundred thousand tertiary structures .",
    "the availability of these structural data enables the comparative study of evolutionary processes , which has a potential to decrypt the structure - function relationship .",
    "another approach is to utilize abundant protein sequence and structural information at hand to set up theoretical models for relationships between protein structures and functions .",
    "an ultimate goal is to predict protein functions from known protein structures , which is one of the most challenging tasks in biological sciences .",
    "theoretical study of the structure - functions relationship of proteins is usually based on fundamental laws of physics , i.e. , quantum mechanics ( qm ) , molecular mechanism ( mm ) , statistical mechanics , thermodynamics , etc .",
    "qm methods are indispensable for chemical reactions and protein degradations .",
    "mm approaches are able to elucidate the conformational landscapes and flexibility patterns of proteins @xcite . however , the all - electron or all - atom representations and long - time integrations lead to such an excessively large number of degrees of freedom that their application to real - time scale protein dynamics becomes prohibitively expensive .",
    "one way to reduce the number of degrees of freedom is to pursue time - independent formulations , such as normal mode analysis ( nma ) @xcite , elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite , including gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite and anisotropic network model ( anm ) @xcite .",
    "multiscale methods are some of the most popular approaches for studying protein structure , function , dynamics and transport @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced differential geometry based multiscale models for biomolecular structure , solvation , and transport @xcite .",
    "a new interaction free approach , called flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) , has also been proposed for the estimation of the shear modulus in the theory of continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) for biomolecules @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the above mentioned models for the study of structure - functions relationship of proteins is that they are structure or geometry based approaches @xcite .",
    "mathematically , these approaches make use of local geometric information , i.e. , coordinates , distances , angles , surfaces @xcite and sometimes curvatures @xcite for the physical modeling of biomolecular systems . indeed , the importance of geometric modeling for structural biology @xcite , biophysics @xcite and bioengineering @xcite can not be overemphasized",

    ", there exists an obvious topology - function relationship .",
    "in fact , just qualitative topological information , rather than quantitative geometric information is needed to understand many physical and biological functions . to state it differently , there is a _ topology - function relationship _ in many biomolecular systems .",
    "topology is exactly the branch of mathematics that deals with the connectivity of different components in a space and is able to classify independent entities , rings and higher dimensional faces within the space .",
    "topology captures geometric properties that are independent of metrics or coordinates .",
    "topological methodologies , such as homology and persistent homology , offer new strategies for analyzing biological functions from biomolecular data , particularly the point clouds of atoms in macromolecules .    in the past decade , persistent homology has been developed as a new multiscale representation of topological features @xcite . in general ,",
    "persistent homology characterizes the geometric features with persistent topological invariants by defining a scale parameter relevant to topological events . through filtration and persistence",
    ", persistent homology can capture topological structures continuously over a range of spatial scales . unlike commonly used computational homology which results in truly metric free or coordinate free representations , persistent homology is able to embed geometric information to topological invariants so that  birth \" and  death \" of isolated components , circles , rings , loops , pockets , voids and cavities at all geometric scales can be monitored by topological measurements .",

    "homology inherently has an additional dimension , the filtration parameter , which can be utilized to embed some crucial geometric or quantitative information into the topological invariants . the importance of retaining geometric information in topological analysis has been recognized in a survey @xcite .",

    "topological tools often incur too much reduction of the original geometric / data information , while geometric tools frequently get lost in the geometric detail or are computationally too expensive to be practical in many situations .",
    "persistent homology is able to bridge between geometry and topology . given the big data challenge in biological science , persistent homology ought to be more efficient for many biological problems .",
    "the objective of the present work is to explore the utility of persistent homology for protein structure characterization , protein flexibility quantification and protein folding stability prediction .",
    "we introduce the molecular topological fingerprint ( mtf ) as a unique topological feature for protein characterization , identification and classification , and for the understanding of the topology - function relationship of biomolecules .",
    "we also introduce all - atom and coarse - grained representations of protein topological fingerprints so as to utilize them for appropriate modeling . to analyze the topological fingerprints of alpha helices and beta sheets in detail ,",
    "we propose the method of slicing , which allows a clear tracking of geometric origins contributing to topological invariants . additionally , to understand the optimal cutoff distance in the gnm",
    ", we introduce a new distance based filtration matrix to recreate the cutoff effect in persistent homology .",
    "our findings shed light on the topological interpretation of the optimal cutoff distance in gnm .",
    "moreover , based on the protein topological fingerprints , we propose accumulated bar lengths to characterize protein topological evolution and quantitatively model protein rigidity based on protein topological connectivity .",
    "this approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of optimal characteristic distance used in the fri method for protein flexibility analysis .",
    "finally the proposed accumulated bar lengths are also employed to predict the total energies of a series of protein folding configurations generated by steered molecular dynamics .",

    "we illustrate several aspects including the definition , the generation and the computation of the simplicial homology with many simple examples .",
    "simplicial complex is a topological space consisting of vertices ( points ) , edges ( line segments ) , triangles , and their high dimensional counterparts .",

    "we can also define the empty set as a ( -1)-simplex .    to combine these geometric components , including vertices , edges , triangles , and tetrahedrons together under certain rules , a simplicial complex is constructed . more specifically",
    ", a simplicial complex @xmath4 is a finite set of simplicies that satisfy two conditions .",
    "the first is that any face of a simplex from @xmath4 is also in @xmath4 .",
    "the second is that the intersection of any two simplices in @xmath4 is either empty or shared faces .",
    "the dimension of a simplicial complex is defined as the maximal dimension of its simplicies .",

    "we develop a method of slicing to systematically divide a biomolecule into small pieces and study their topological traits .",
    "the topological fingerprints of alpha helices and beta sheets are further utilized to decipher the topological property and fingerprint of a beta barrel structure . uncovering the connection between topological invariants and geometric features",
    "deepens our understanding of biomolecular topology - function relationship .",
    "traditionally , long - lived persistent bars in the barcode have been celebrated as intrinsic topological features that persistent homology was invented for , while other short - lived bars are generally regarded as useless noise .",
    "however , from our analysis , it is emphasized that all features generated from persistent homology analysis are equally important because they represent the topological fingerprint of a given protein structure .",
    "therefore , the birth and death of each @xmath5-complex uniquely represent either a local or a global geometric feature .",
    "it is all of these topological features that make the mtf unique for each biomolecule .",
    "just like nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) signals or x - ray crystallography data , topological fingerprints are a new class of biometrics for the identification , characterization and classification of biomolecules .",
    "the rigidity of a protein is essentially determined by its non - covalent interactions and manifests in the compactness of its three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure .",
    "such a compactness can be measured by the topological connectivity of the protein polymer chain elements , i.e. , amino acid residues .",
    "consequently , topological invariants , such as the first betti number , give rise to a natural description of protein rigidity and flexibility .",
    "we therefore are able to reveal the topology - function relationship .",
    "elastic network models , such as gaussian network model , have been widely used for protein flexibility analysis . however , the performance of these methods depends on the cutoff distance which determines whether a given pair of atoms can be connected by an elastic spring in the model . in practical applications ,",
    "the selection of a cutoff distance is empirical .",
    "we propose a new cutoff distance type of filtration matrix .",
    "the resulting topological diagrams shed light on the optimal cutoff distance used in the protein b - factor prediction with the gaussian network model .",
    "the aforementioned persistent homology analyses are descriptive and qualitative .",
    "one of major goals of the present work is to exploit the geometric information embedded in topological invariants for quantitative modeling . to this end",
    ", we propose a correlation matrix based filtration to incorporate geometric information in topological invariants .",
    "we define accumulated bar length by summing over all the bars of the first betti number .",
    "we assume that the accumulated bar length correlates linearly to protein rigidity due to hydrogen bond strength , hydrophobic effects , electrostatic and van der waals interactions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the dependence of the accumulated bar length on the characteristic distance used in our filtration process .",
    "it is found that the location of the maximum accumulated bar length gives an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance for the flexibility and rigidity index ( fri ) analysis @xcite of protein temperature factors .    to further exploit persistent homology for quantitative modeling , we consider protein folding which is an essential process for proteins to assume well - define structure and function .",
    "our basic observation is that well - folded proteins , especially well - folded globular proteins , have abundant non - covalent bonds due to hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions , which translates into higher numbers of topological invariants , particularly , a large measurement of the first betti number .",
    "additionally , the funnel theory of protein folding states that a well - folded protein , i.e. , the native structure , has the lowest free energy .",
    "in contrast , unfolded protein structures have less numbers of topological invariants and higher free energies .",
    "based on this analysis , we propose a persistent homology based model to characterize protein topological evolution and predict protein folding stability .",
    "we correlate the negative accumulated bar length of the first betti number to the protein total energy for a series of protein configurations generated by the steered molecular dynamics .",
    "as such the evolution of topological invariants in the protein folding / unfolding process is tracked .",

    "<S> proteins are the most important biomolecules for living organisms . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of protein structure , function , dynamics and transport is one of most challenging tasks in biological science . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> persistent homology is , for the first time , introduced for extracting molecular topological fingerprints ( mtfs ) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants . </S>",
    "<S> mtfs are utilized for protein characterization , identification and classification . </S>",
    "<S> the method of slicing is proposed to track the geometric origin of protein topological invariants . </S>",
    "<S> both all - atom and coarse - grained representations of mtfs are constructed . </S>",
    "<S> a new cutoff - like filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic network models . </S>",
    "<S> based on the correlation between protein compactness , rigidity and connectivity , we propose an accumulated bar length generated from persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein flexibility . to this end , a correlation matrix based filtration is developed . </S>",
    "<S> this approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance used in protein b - factor analysis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , mtfs are employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent consistence between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found . </S>",
