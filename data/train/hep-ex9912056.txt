    "in this paper the status of heavy flavours , charm , bottom and top , is reviewed .",
    "for the charm quark , emphasis is placed on measurements of the production rates and the differential cross sections at hera and the tevatron and of the extraction of the gluon structure function from the proton at hera using charm .",
    "the large kinematic range at hera leads to a number of models with limits on applicability .",
    "these models can not be directly applied to the tevatron and the work to understand charm production is not complete . for bottom physics , the current status of the lifetime ratios between charged and neutral mesons is examined in the context of the spectator model .",
    "the production cross section at hera and the tevatron is also studied revealing an area that needs further study .",
    "experimental methods for doing a @xmath0 mixing analysis at hadron machines are explored and the results of a variety of @xmath0 mixing studies presented .",
    "this leads to a description of the measurement of the cp violation parameter , @xmath1 , at cdf as an indication of the propects for measurements of this value at hadron machines . a brief summary of the current knowledge and world sample of top quarks closes the report .",
    "figure  [ fig : disandwdepend ] illustrates the relevent kinematic variables in vector boson , v , production at hera for v=@xmath2 : _ s _ , the electron - proton center of mass energy , _ q _ , the photon virtuality , _ t _ , the four momentum transfer to proton , @xmath3 , the mass of dissociated proton remnants , _ w _ , the @xmath4-proton cm energy . by choosing various ranges in the kinematic variables , experimental observations can be matched to theoretical predictions for the processes expected to dominate the dynamics in the chosen region .",
    "various descriptions of charm production and the relationship between theoretical description and experimental signature are given in table  [ tab : heramess ] where the variable _ z _ , the fraction of @xmath4 momentum given to _",
    "j_/@xmath5 , has been introduced . in each case",
    "a @xmath2 or a @xmath6 is observed .",
    "the first column of the table gives an additional experimental constraint .",
    "the second column is the conventional description of the process with the third column indicating constraints on the kinematics .",

    "one suggested  @xcite choice for the scale is @xmath13/4 $ ] .",
    "this implies that for applications of perturbative qcd , the minimum scale is the mass of the @xmath2 .",
    "there is heated debate over whether perturbative qcd computations of one or two gluon ladders can describe the data  @xcite or whether modified models of soft pomeron exchange  @xcite are more satisfactory .",
    "one example where the perturbative qcd models describe the data is illustrated in figure  [ fig : disandwdepend ]  @xcite .",
    "the data are also shown to have a @xmath14 dependence such that the cross section goes as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the vector dominance model and regge theory predict a smaller slope of @xmath17 and therefore do not provide a good description of the data .",
    "further success in the description of the data can be found in the measurement of the gluon structure function using open charm production and comparing it to the measurement of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated for the h1 measurement in figure  [ fig : gx ] .",
    "the rapid rise of the gluon structure function at low @xmath19 is a prediction of its evolution in the context of the dglap equations  @xcite .",
    "however , application of perturbative qcd to the tevatron collider data does not succeed  @xcite .",
    "a colour singlet model  @xcite , like that used successfully in hera , fails .",
    "the disagreement is as large as a factor of 50 .",
    "better agreement can be found if the cdf data are fit with the colour octet model  @xcite ; however the fits of this model fail badly when applied to the differential cross sections measured in a variety of kinematic variables at hera  @xcite .    while it is tempting to dismiss the scale set by the charm mass as too small and the discrepancies as being no surprise , doing so would ignore the results where there is success in the predictions . assembling the successes and failures and understanding the limits of the use of perturbative qcd and its matching with soft",
    "phenomenology remains an unsolved problem .",
    "the production of @xmath20 quarks in hadron machines differs from the intuitively appealing @xmath21 decay mechanism resulting in two 45 gev jets having @xmath0 mesons carrying 80% of the jet energy . in hadron",
    "machines the trigger biases the kinematics .",
    "one trigger used by cdf is a lepton having high transverse momentum relative to the proton - antiproton collision .",
    "the lepton can be either an electron or muon from a semileptonic decay .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons typically have a transverse momentum of @xmath22 gev / c .",
    "another very important trigger is a dimuon trigger with a cut on the invariant mass of the muons .",
    "this @xmath2 trigger , so called because the invariant mass of the muons is required to be within a broad range around the @xmath2 mass , will yield @xmath0 mesons having a @xmath23 gev / c .",
    "alternatively the @xmath2 mass may be excluded in order to get a cascade of sequential decays : @xmath24 followed by @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons or baryons carry 70% of the @xmath20 quark energy but the particles may or may not be recognizable as jets .",
    "the hadron colliders then rely on lepton tagging , displaced vertices and reconstructed decay products to perform the measurements . in this regard ,",
    "once the trigger provides a @xmath20-enriched sample , the tools for finding @xmath20 s are similar in hadron and lepton colliders .",
    "narrow resonances are particularly useful because they reduce the combinatoric possibilities . from such samples , a variety of measurements have been performed and in the following sections a few have been selected for exposition .",
    "one measurement of particular significance is that of the various @xmath0 meson and baryon lifetimes  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath20 lifetimes is important because it probes the extent to which the simple spectator model is valid and the degree to which the other diagrams including @xmath14 exchange and final state interference play a role .",
    "the measured value of the charged to neutral meson lifetime ratio is @xmath26 , well within the theoretical prediction of 1.0 - 1.1 .",
    "thus , to a precision of a few per - cent , the spectator model is quite good and the more subtle effects are only beginning to be seen .",
    "there is some discrepancy for the baryon lifetimes ; however , their errors remain statistically dominated and rigorous theoretical tests await the larger data samples anticipated at the next run of the tevatron .      as with the charm quark , theoretical computation of inclusive bottom production cross sections",
    "is not well understood . for the production of open @xmath20 ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bopencrossect ] , the situation is as follows .",
    "the d0 collaboration  @xcite finds that the shape is well described but the cross section is a factor of two to three higher than the theory predicts .",
    "the h1 collaboration  @xcite used inclusive muon production and reported a production cross section about a factor of five above theoretical prediction .",
    "this analysis has subsequently been revised  @xcite and is now only two times the prediction .",
    "the cdf collaboration finds that the cross sections for @xmath0 @xmath27,@xmath28  @xcite , as well as inclusive muon production  @xcite are all about a factor of two higher than expected in theory .",
    "the production of @xmath29 at cdf  @xcite is a factor of two to five times larger than expected , and at zeus the photoproduction rate of @xmath29 is a factor of five too high  @xcite .",
    "various @xmath20 production mechanisms at a hadron collider have very different kinematics . at tree level two @xmath20",
    "quarks are produced with an azimuthal separation of 180 degrees .",
    "in contrast to this a contribution from gluon splitting results in both @xmath20 quarks recoiling against a gluon  @xcite , giving a small azimuthal separation of the @xmath20 and @xmath30 quarks .",
    "if these contributions are not computed correctly , this can result in an improper determination of acceptance and hence the cross sections can be extracted improperly .",
    "these contributions have been explored  @xcite by measuring the azimuthal separation of the muon decay from the @xmath20 quark and the jet from the @xmath31 which was tagged using the impact parameter of the tracks in the jet .",
    "the result shown in figure  [ fig : bopencrossect ] indicates that while the normalisation remains incorrect , the shape seems to be correctly reproduced but with rather large errors in the sensitive region .      among the measurements of rare decays ,",
    "one of current interest is the cleo  @xcite measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath32 .",
    "this is bad news for the measurement of @xmath33 since estimates on the experimental errors assumed a branching ratio a factor of two larger .",
    "cdf  @xcite has measured the angular distributions of the decay products in @xmath34 to obtain the polarization of the @xmath35 and found that the p - odd component is small .",
    "this is good news for identifying channels with a well - defined cp eigenstate but the results are low in statistics .",
    "cdf has also observed  @xcite the @xmath36 and the lifetime measurement indicates that @xmath37 quark decays first : @xmath38 ps .",
    "unfortunately , full reconstruction of the @xmath36 in @xmath39 will be difficult because the lifetime measurement implies a branching ratio that is ten times smaller .",
    "a number of precise measurements of @xmath40 mixing at lep , slc and the tevatron exist .",
    "the fraction of mixed mesons is given by @xmath41 and is measured as a function of proper time . in order to measure mixing , the @xmath35 meson must be reconstructed or partially reconstructed and its flavour must be tagged at production and decay .",
    "two major classes of tagging in @xmath0 mixing are same side and opposite side tagging . given a semileptonic decay on one side where the lepton satisfied a trigger , one may search for a semileptonic decay on the other side . since the other lepton is not biased by the trigger , it generally has lower momentum and is called a slow lepton .",
    "this tag is referred to as a slow lepton tag ( slt ) .",
    "the soft fragmentation pion in the same hemisphere as the @xmath40 meson may be identified and used to tag the initial @xmath40 state .",
    "this is called a same side tag ( sst ) .",
    "the charge of particles in the opposite hemisphere may be summed with a momentum or lifetime weighting to provide a jet charge tag .",
    "the cdf group has measurements that use the following combinations of tags  @xcite : @xmath6 lep / sst ; lep/@xmath42 , lep ; @xmath43/@xmath44 ; @xmath44/@xmath44 ; @xmath6 lep / lep ; @xmath45/lep .",
    "results for these mixing measurements are shown in table  [ tab : cdfbmix ] .",
    "they agree with one another and with other measurements of @xmath0 mixing at lep and sld  @xcite .",

    "this is currently done by fitting the data with a fixed mixing frequency and allowing the amplitude to vary as @xmath56 .",
    "the result presented by the lep @xmath0 mixing working group is that the world average @xmath57 ps@xmath48 at 95% cl . because a large value of @xmath58 will result in different lifetimes for the two eigenstates ,",
    "the @xmath55 lifetime may be fitted for two components . combined results from lep and cdf",
    "give @xmath59 40ps@xmath48 at 95% cl .",
    "using the world average @xmath55 lifetime , this gives @xmath60 it is worth noting that cdf runii with the layer 00 upgrade can reach a value of @xmath61 .",
    "also , the sld and lep collaborations still have analysis that take advantage of improvements in their tracking that could in fact find a value of @xmath58 before the tevatron takes data .",
    "cdf  @xcite and opal  @xcite have produced measurements of the cp asymmetry where a @xmath40 meson decays to the same eigenstate .",
    "this asymmetry is given by : @xmath62 in all cases , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dilution due to mistagging and the error on the cp asymmetry goes as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the tagging efficiency or the fraction of events tagged and @xmath67 is the dilution or the number of right , @xmath68 , minus wrong , @xmath14 , tags .",
    "the analysis of cp asymmetry hinges on the ability to tag accurately , maximising the dilution parameter .",
    "cdf reconstructs @xmath2 and @xmath69 with 400 events observed .",
    "half of these are contained in the silicon tracker , the svx , so that there is a time - dependent measurement for 200 events . because the behaviour of @xmath70 is a sine function , and the largest background is at low lifetimes , most sensitivity to @xmath71 is in a lower background region at higher lifetimes .    in order to obtain @xmath1 ,",
    "the dilution must be measured .",
    "this is done using a @xmath72 sample to obtain the dilution in the jet charge and slow lepton tags .",
    "a lepton @xmath6 sample is used to determine the sst dilution . a boost correction from monte carlo",
    "must be added , resulting in a systematic uncertainty @xmath73 .",
    "the measured dilutions and contributions to the value of @xmath1 for each of the tagging methods is detailed in table  [ tab : sin2b ] .",
    "@llll tag & @xmath74 & @xmath64 & @xmath1 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 + @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + slt & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 + jetq & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + global & & @xmath88 +    [ tab : sin2b ]    the resulting cp asymmetry is plotted as a function of proper time in figure  [ fig : sin2b ] .",
    "the result is that @xmath89 or @xmath90 at 93%cl .",
    "this may be compared to the opal measurement of @xmath91 .",
    "this is a proof of principle showing that in the hadron collider the error is predominantly statistical .",
    "furthermore , since the systematic errors are statistics dominated , having more data will improve the measurement .",
    "the decay of a top quark results in six jets , or four jets , a lepton and a neutrino or two jets with two leptons and two neutrinos . in each case , two of the jets are @xmath20 jets .",
    "these three cases comprise the major signatures for top that are studied at the tevatron .",

    "in surveying the present state of heavy flavours , one is first struck by the fact that the heavy quark cross sections are all too high .",
    "the top cross section agrees with theory but the errors are large .",
    "the @xmath37 quarks are used at hera to successfully set the scale for qcd and measure the gluon structure function ; however , a consistent explanation of the production cross sections at hera and the tevatron is not possible .",

    "cp violation measurements in hadron machines are not limited by systematics and the @xmath120 machines are starting up . with the data that will be collected at the tevatron , hera , and at the @xmath121 machines ( belle , pepii , and cesr ) there will be a fantastic increase in information on heavy flavours in the next few years .",
