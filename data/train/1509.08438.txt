    "the inventory of potential achievements that quantum entanglement may bring about has steadily grown for decades .",
    "it is the concept behind most of the non - trivial , classically prohibitive tasks in information science @xcite .",
    "however , for entanglement to become a useful resource in general , much work is yet to be done .",
    "the efficient creation of entanglement , often involving many degrees of freedom , is one of the first challenges to be coped with , whose simplest instance are the sources of correlated pairs of two - level systems .",
    "these sources have been used to demonstrate the possibility of teleporting an unknown qubit @xcite and to disclose the nonlocality of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "some other important tasks require more involved kinds of entanglement , e. g. , a prominent framework for measurement - based quantum computation is possible only if cluster sates are available @xcite .    in the last two decades",
    "the increasing interest in complex entanglement motivated a fair amount of works aiming at the creation of larger than einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states .",
    "most of these efforts have produced greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite involving three @xcite , four @xcite , five @xcite , six @xcite , and eight @xcite qubits .",
    "other multiqubit states have been built , though more sparsely , for instance , dicke states @xcite and graph states @xcite . intermediate kinds of entanglement have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this manuscript we are mainly interested in the creation of tripartite @xmath0 states . in the first experimental realization of such a state @xcite",
    ", four photons originated from second order parametric down conversion ( pdc ) are sent to distinct spatial modes and through linear optical elements .",
    "the conditional detection of one of the photons leaves the remaining three photons in the desired @xmath0 state with a probability of @xmath2 for each second order pdc event .",
    "since these occurrences are by themselves rare , the whole process lacks efficiency . a sufficiently robust experiment to enable state tomography",
    "is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where three - fold coincidences were observed with a rate about 40 times higher than that of @xcite . however , the creation of @xmath0 states remained probabilistic , thus , requiring postselection . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an experiment based on two independent first order pdc events is described , resulting in @xmath0 states of four and three photons .",
    "the latter being achieved , again , only probabilistically , through a measurement on one of the parties .",
    "projective measurements , that present intrinsic stochasticity , can also be used to produce @xmath0-type entanglement @xcite .",
    "more in the spirit of the present work , bipartite entanglement can be considered as an available resource , as is the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , that takes two pairs of photons in epr states as the building blocks to probabilistically produce @xmath0 states of three parties .",
    "very recently general tripartite entangled states were encoded in the nuclei of the fluorine atoms of trifluoroiodoethylene molecules , via nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "this technique , however , is unsuited for remote preparation because the state is encoded in a spatially localized structure .    in the theoretical front , protocols based on pdc @xcite , linear optics @xcite , sources of epr states @xcite , atomic systems @xcite , and nitrogen - vacancy centers @xcite can be found , all being probabilistic . in contrast , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "propose a deterministic scheme to create four - partite @xmath0 states , which can be extended to generate @xmath0 states of arbitrary dimension @xcite .",
    "more recently , a procedure was suggested to create entangled states of several degrees of freedom , which is particularly suited for @xmath0 states .",
    "this fusion operation @xcite corresponds to a swapping procedure and employs two entangled states with dimension @xmath3 to produce an entangled state of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that there is a source of bipartite entanglement , ideally delivering identical epr pairs .",
    "three such doubles are needed in each run , with one particle of each pair being sent to three detectors ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 e @xmath7 ) . at this point",
    "let us simply consider that the state of three pairs coming from the source is @xmath8 : @xmath9 of course , it does not matter which erp state one choses , provided that it is known .",
    "we intend to make a triple measurement on the odd labelled particles ( subsystem @xmath10 ) which are sent to the detectors , see fig .",
    "we note from the outset that the measurement on subsystem @xmath10 may be destructive and will be assumed to be so , although this is not a logical necessity .",
    "the key point of our protocol , which enables the deterministic creation of @xmath0 states , is the the following set of kets : @xmath11 is the tripartite @xmath0 state as we are used to it and @xmath12 its negation .",
    "the other six states may not seem to be of the same category , since they are not combinations of kets with the same number of `` excitations '' .",
    "however , it is easy to see that they also represent perfect @xmath0 states , for , @xmath13 is obtainable from any of them via local , unitary operations , e. g. , @xmath14 , etc .",
    "note also that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we have at our disposal an orthonormal @xmath0-state basis , that , in principle , corresponds to the eigenvectors of some observable that can be measured .",
    "given the ideal source state @xmath8 , after conveniently reordering the kets , it can be written as @xmath17\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where particles 1 , 3 , and 5 belong to subsystem @xmath10 and the remaining particles to the subsystem @xmath18 .",
    "this state is given in terms of basis ( [ wbasis ] ) in the totally correlated form : @xmath19 by executing a projective measurement in this basis for particles in @xmath10 we _ deterministically _ obtain , after local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , a perfect set of pure states in the standard form @xmath13 in subsystem @xmath18 .",
    "of course , the measurements in the entangled basis ( [ wbasis ] ) constitute a technical difficulty in practice , but there is nothing that prevents their realization , in principle ( more on this point in the next sections ) .",
    "the required local unitary operations are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "note , in addition , that it does not matter how far apart are the particles of system @xmath18 , thus , the preparation may be remote .",
    ".operations to be done on system @xmath18 after the measurements on @xmath10 to deterministically produce @xmath13 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , it remains possible to get an ideal set of @xmath0 states after postselection , because whenever the result of the measurement is @xmath13 ( @xmath12 ) the produced state on @xmath18 is @xmath13 ( @xmath12 ) _ no matter _ the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , by postselecting the outcomes @xmath13 and @xmath12 , proceeding the appropriate locc for the latter , one gets a pure ensemble of standard @xmath0 states .",
    "the success probability is @xmath24 .",
    "note that it is bounded from above by @xmath25 , since we are eliminating the other six outcomes even if they lead to states with high fidelity .    in a more realistic scenario",
    ", one may not be able to carry out a full measurement in the basis ( [ wbasis ] ) .",
    "this is indeed the case of our present technical development .",
    "note however that if we can unambiguously distinguish @xmath13 from @xmath12 , and these from the other states , then we are able to remotely produce perfect @xmath0 states from an imperfect bipartite source with probability @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible to tackle an equivalent task with linear - optics elements in the case of a ghz basis @xcite .",
    "although we can not directly compare the entanglement of systems with two and three parties , we argue that the previous procedure leads to entanglement concentration @xcite .",
    "the source of bipartite states may have arbitrarily low entanglement and the result is always a highly entangled tripartite state , of course at the cost of a proportional reduction in the number of elements in the final ensemble .",
    "but this is exactly what happens for entanglement concentration between ensembles of states with the same dimensionality @xcite .",
    "if the source is composed by @xmath27 quasi - separable pairs with state @xmath28 , then we get @xmath29 perfect @xmath0 states , asymptotically .",
    "it is evident that any reasonable measure of multipartite entanglement @xmath30 , would give @xmath31 , for sufficiently small @xmath32 .",
    "also , because the entanglement delivered by the source is bipartite while the product presents genuine tripartite entanglement , we say that the entanglement has been _ lifted _ ( from a `` small '' hilbert space to a larger one ) .",
    "this is a remarkable property of @xmath0 states , and an analogous situation does not exist for ghz states .",
    "if the source has @xmath33 , by any small extent , then the probability to get an exact ghz state in any run is zero , and no postselection could help in getting an ideal ghz ensemble .",
    "this adds to the reasoning that @xmath0 states are less entangled than ghz states , in the sense that from three non - maximally entangled states one can , via stochastic locc ( slocc ) @xcite get a perfect @xmath0 but not a perfect ghz .",
    "the referred postselection may be a waste of resources if some amount of error can be tolerated in a scenario where full measurements can be carried out . for a good , but imperfect source ,",
    "the outputs are either perfect or so close to the ideal states that the chance that they can be distinguished in practice is very small .",
    "note from the second line of eq .",
    "( [ wimperf ] ) , that if , e. g. , we obtain @xmath34 in subsystem @xmath10 , then the state in @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "so , for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "we proceed to show that even if all measurement outcomes are utilized , the fidelity of the resulting state with respect to @xmath13 is slightly improved in comparison to the fidelity of ( [ psi1 ] ) with respect to the ideal source state @xmath41 . without postselection ,",
    "the possible states left in @xmath18 after the measurement in @xmath10 are listed in the first column of table [ table2 ] .",
    "the next step is to proceed with the operations in table [ table1 ] .",
    "that leaves the first state in table [ table2 ] unchanged , while the second ( not normalized ) state undergoes the transformation @xmath42 and so on , see the second column of table [ table2 ]",
    ". gathering these results together and considering their probabilities ( third column of table [ table2 ] ) , the resulting density matrix for the mixed state reads , in the @xmath0 basis [ eq . ( [ wbasis ] ) ] , @xmath43 where the absolute value of the coherences reads @xmath44/9 $ ] and @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ fidw ] ) is the final fidelity , @xmath48 . since the described protocol amounts to lifting entanglement from a hilbert space with dimension 4 to a hilbert space with dimension 8 , it could be considered useful even if the final fidelity were smaller than the fidelity of the source , to an acceptable extent",
    "however , we note that the fidelity of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ psi1 ] ) , with respect to an ideal source is @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , with @xmath52 . for phase arguments outside this range",
    "the source would better described by the bell state @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 so that if the source produces single pairs with states @xmath55 , whose fidelity is @xmath56 , then we obtain an ensemble whose fidelity with respect to an ideal @xmath0 state is @xmath57 ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) . in particular",
    ", a borderline initial fidelity of @xmath58 leads to @xmath59 .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath60 ( dashed ) as functions of @xmath20 for ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=160 ]   ( solid ) and @xmath60 ( dashed ) as functions of @xmath20 for ( a ) @xmath61 and ( b ) @xmath62 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=160 ]    it is important to recall that in this whole process , without postselection , there are no losses but those due to the measurement in @xmath10 . whenever the epr source has @xmath27 particles the resulting @xmath0-state ensemble has @xmath63 particles , which renders statistical efficiency to the protocol . in addition , if the physical realization of the bipartite source is provided by entangled photons , we only demand first order pdc , that is , three pairs generated in sequence , provided that the setup is capable of keeping the coherence of the pairs in the typical window of time for the occurrence of three pdc events .",
    "let us finally comment on the scenario in which the source , in addition to the systematic error , presents a fraction @xmath64 of white noise .",
    "a conservative hypothesis for the state of the triples in the source is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 identity operator . in this case",
    "it is immediate to see that the noise fraction remains unchanged throughout the protocol , and the obtained density operator reads @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) . that is to say",
    ", our lifting procedure leads to entanglement concentration but probably not to entanglement distillation upon depolarizing noise .",
    "it is arguably easier , both conceptually and experimentally , to create a four - partite @xmath0 state than to produce a tripartite @xmath1 .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that most of the measurements involved in the previous protocols are of bell type . in this work",
    "we provide a full basis of @xmath0 states which induces more appropriate measurements to produce the desired type of entanglement .",
    "of course , we are aware of the technical difficulties associated with full measurements involving entangled bases , either without interactions between the subsystems @xcite or with passive linear elements only @xcite . in the last fifteen years , many ways to circumvent these difficulties have been proposed , employing ancillary systems ( hyperentanglement ) @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , or even active linear optical elements @xcite .",
    "in addition , we note that in the case of a perfect source , if one can distinguish @xmath70 basis elements out of 8 , then we have a statistical efficiency of @xmath71 . even in the case of imperfect sources , to produce ideal @xmath0 states only requires the ability to distinguish @xmath13 from @xmath12 , and these states from the rest of the basis elements .",
    "this is a much more modest task .",
    "finally , we note that the measurement on subsystem @xmath10 can be made in a very localized region of space ( without affecting the remote character of the state left in @xmath18 ) , enabling the execution of cnot gates involving particles 1 , 3 , and 5 .    our results can be summarized as follows : when the epr source is ideal , a pure ensemble of @xmath0 states can be deterministically produced .",
    "in addition , if the bipartite source is non - maximally entangled , one can still obtain a set of pure @xmath0 states , this time at the cost of postselection .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the states @xmath72 that , for instance , does not hold for ghz states .",
    "in fact one can produce perfect @xmath0 states from arbitrarily poor entanglement , but , the poorest the entanglement of the source the smaller the number of states @xmath73 in the ensemble .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to profit from every individual run , for , even without post selection one gets a mixed tripartite state whose fidelity ( with respect to @xmath1 ) is higher than that of the triple of pairs coming from the source ( in comparison to a perfect triple of epr pairs )",
    ". finally we emphasize the possibility of creating remote entangled systems , allowing , e. g. , distribution of keys .",
