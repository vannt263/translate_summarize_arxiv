    "transition metal oxides ( tmo ) are a class of solid  state materials that exhibit a rich variety of physical phenomena@xcite . among them , magnetic cubic spinels av@xmath0o@xmath1 have recently attracted much attention due to geometrically frustrated corner sharing tetrahedral network formed by the v atoms ( also known as a pyrochlore lattice)@xcite .",
    "an interesting example is represented by mnv@xmath0o@xmath1 which is the spinel having additional magnetic mn ions .",
    "it exhibits an orbital ordering ( oo)that occurs at finite @xmath3 as a thermal phase transition : at room temperature , crystalline mnv@xmath0o@xmath1 is a cubic paramagnet ( pm ) where mn sites occupy the centers of oxygen tetrahedra ( mno@xmath1 units ) , while v sites occupy the centers of oxygen octahedra ( vo@xmath4 units ) which exhibit slight trigonal distortions consistent with the @xmath5 cubic symmetry . as @xmath3 is lowered there",
    "occur two phase transitions : [ 1 ] a magnetic transition at @xmath6 k from the high@xmath3 pm phase to a cubic ferrimagnetic ( fem ) phase , with the mn and v moments anti  aligned ; [ 2 ] followed by a second transition at @xmath7 k to a tetragonal , non  collinear fem with orbital ordering of @xmath8 @xmath9 electrons@xcite .",
    "the orbital ordered phase is accompanied by a reduction of the v magnetic moments due to the formation of the electron orbital moment ( finite orbital angular momentum ) .",
    "the orbital moment , @xmath10 , is anti  aligned with the spin moment , @xmath11 , giving the total moment of @xmath12 gar08 .",
    "the reduced value of v moment has been reproduced by an earlier first ",
    "principles work in ref . , and is explained by the spin  orbit coupling ( soc )  on the v @xmath9 which generally favors anti  alignment of spin and orbital angular momenta for @xmath3 below the energy scale of soc @xcite .",
    "the local tetrahedral and octahedral coordination of the mn and v sites results in the crystal  field ( cf ) splitting of their 5-fold @xmath13 orbital degeneracy .",
    "tetrahedrally coordinated mn has an @xmath14 lower in energy than @xmath15 , while the splitting is opposite for octahedrally coordinated v. inter ",
    "electron coulomb interactions and exchange anti  symmetry lead to hund s rule splitting of up and down spins , which is greater than the cf splitting . in the stoichiometric crystalline environment",

    "spin @xmath16 configuration of @xmath17 and a valence of @xmath18 : all 5 up ",
    "spin @xmath13 orbitals are occupied giving @xmath19 ( quenched total orbital moment ) , and the down spin ones are empty .",
    "v has a valence of @xmath20 , an outer shell configuration of @xmath9 , and @xmath21 : in this case , 2 electrons must occupy the 3 @xmath15 orbitals . in the high temperature cubic phase ,",
    "these latter three are nearly degenerate , while in the low temperature tetragonal phase , where the unit cell is slightly compressed along the @xmath22axis , the @xmath23 is lowered in energy while @xmath24 , @xmath25 remain degenerate .",
    "thus , in the tetragonal ( low@xmath3 ) phase , one electron on v occupies the @xmath23 , and the second electron has the freedom to occupy either @xmath24 , or @xmath26 . unlike mn ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum of v is not fully quenched : the partial occupation of the @xmath24 and @xmath26 gives an effective orbital angular momentum @xmath27 for v. the fact that @xmath28 implies that there maybe non  negligible effects of soc in the v atoms @xcite .",
    "further , this is a hint that the @xmath24 and @xmath26 could form complex linear combinations of one  electron states if it happens that @xmath29 , since only such a complex state can have a non  zero @xmath30 . the freedom of the second electron of v to occupy @xmath24 , @xmath26 , or some linear combination of the two gives rise to the possibility of long  range orbital order in the low@xmath3 phase .",
    "two simple choices has been proposed for the orbital ordering in this spinel and both have been studied theoretically in mean field models .",
    "one is the antiferro  orbital order ( afoo ) with alternate occupation of the @xmath24 and @xmath26 along the c  axis , i.e. : the same orbital is occupied in a given @xmath31plane but the other orbital is occupied in the adjacent planes above and below@xcite , as shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",

    "group @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in the latter ,",
    "if the orbital order is a complex linear combination of @xmath24 and @xmath26 there will be a non  zero orbital angular momentum and a magnetic moment associated with it@xcite .",

    "while a slight trigonal distortion is present even in the high@xmath3 cubic phase , there is a qualitative symmetry  lowering change and an increase in this distortion in the low@xmath3 phase which lifts the residual degeneracy between @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and of the @xmath14 manifold , and combined with the tetragonal distortion results in the mixing all 5 @xmath13 orbtials . in this case , the above oo proposals are not necessarily correct as these assume degeneracy between the @xmath24 , @xmath26 orbitals .",

    "the coulomb and exchange parameters in the solid state are generally screened , and hence reduced by a considerable amount from their bare atomic values@xcite .",
    "the structural parameters for all three phases are taken from experiment@xcite : in the cubic phase , the lattice constant is @xmath59 a.u . ,",

    "the non  collinear orbital ordered phase occurs when the temperature is reduced below @xmath7 k. this phase transition results simultaneously in : [ 1 ] a structural transition from cubic to tetragonal ; [ 2 ] the canting of v moments from a _ collinear _ ferrimagnetic ( fem ) to a @xmath62 _ non - collinear _ fem spin order with non  zero components in the @xmath36plane ; and [ 3 ] a long  range orbital order in the v @xmath15 manifold .",

    "the results of the parabolic fit that best match the experimentally known @xmath50 values are given in table  [ table2 ] for both the v @xmath9 and mn @xmath17 shells .",
    "the easy axis for mn is @xmath140axis , and for v it is either @xmath141 or @xmath142 .",
    "the easy axis always has a negative anisotropy parameter , which means the energy is lowered when the spin projection along the easy axis is maximized . for mn , the spin projection along @xmath94 tends to be maximized .",

    "so , v spin projection likes to be maximized along @xmath142 , and minimized along @xmath94@xcite .",
    "thus , the v spin moment has a tendency to be in a non  collinear direction with respect to the @xmath94axis .",
    "our anisotropy computation is able to reproduce these signs as well as magnitudes for mn ( @xmath17 ) and v ( @xmath9 ) shells .",
    "looking at the anisotropy fit values we see that the value of mn anisotropy reported in ref .",
    "are obtained for @xmath143 ev , @xmath144 ev , namely @xmath145 mev , which is similar to the literature value . for our fitted values of v anisotropy , we do not find such a close match , but there are several cf values which give the anisotropy of ref .   up to the correct sign and order of magnitude .",

    "one reason why our calculated @xmath152 parameter differs by a large amount from the experimental value is because we have to tune the cf energy levels to simultaneously match two different single ",

    ", we show the spin waves for the other orbital orders , also obtained with small trigonal distortion and @xmath63 ev , that _ do not _ match well with the experimental data .",
    "the model parameters for these orbital orders do give a reasonable spin canting angle when using eq .  [ eqn2 ] , but the upper branches of the spin waves corresponding to the v oscillations are too high in energy and have a larger band  width in these plots ( due to considerable overestimate of v  v exchange ) compared to the correct one in fig .",

    "as table  [ table1 ] shows , this order again gives a considerably greater v  v exchange compared to the experiment and therefore the upper branches are much higher in energy and have a greater dispersion relative to the experimental plot .",

    "the trend we notice is that small trigonal distortion + lower @xmath2 as well as large trigonal distortion + higher @xmath2 both give @xmath56s that are close to the experimental @xmath56s , however , the former case with ` soc - foo ' seems to give the best match of all the combinations we have tried .",
    "the other two orbital orders , ` afoo - i ' and ` afoo - ii ' , do not give such a good match with experiment throughout the brillouin zone for the same value of distortion and @xmath2 so these orders may be ruled out .",
    "we further note that the spin ",
    "orbit coupling plays an important role in the orbital physics of v  atoms in mnv@xmath157o@xmath1 .",
    "this is also justified by the fact that the single ",
    "ion anisotropy is relatively high , as evidenced by the large gaps for the would ",
    "be acoustic modes at @xmath158 .",
    "by theoretical computations of the interatomic exchange constants using lsda+@xmath2(+so ) method , magnetic force theorem and by imposing various orbital ordering scenarios we have shown that the orbital order on the v sites of mnv@xmath0o@xmath1 is similar to a complex linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath24 on all v sites .",
    "our calculated spin wave spectra for this order come closest to the experimental data .",
    "further support in evidence of the complex order is the strong single ",
    "ion anisotropy experienced by the spin moments on the v sites , as well as the _ reduction _ of the v magnetic moment in the low@xmath3 phase@xcite which could not be captured by lsda+@xmath2 alone .",
