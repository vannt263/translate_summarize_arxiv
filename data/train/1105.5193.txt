    "<S> inspired by the newly observed two charged bottomonium - like states , we consider the possible contribution from the intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath1 states to the @xmath2 decay process , which naturally explains belle s previous observation of the anomalous @xmath3 production near the peak of @xmath4 at @xmath5 gev [ k.f . chen _ et al_.

    "<S> the resulting @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions agree with belle s measurement after inclusion of these @xmath8 states . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism also reproduces the belle observation of the double - peak structure and its reflection in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath10 decay .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the belle collaboration announced the first observation of two charged bottomonium - like states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the hidden - bottom decay channels @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured parameters of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath15 the analysis of the angular distribution indicates that the quantum numbers of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath16 . both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are charged hidden - bottom states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover they are very close to the thresholds of @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are ideal candidates of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 s - wave molecular states , which were studied extensively in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a new puzzle arises in the theoretical study @xcite of the dipion invariant mass distribution and the @xmath19 distribution of the anomalous @xmath20 production near the peak of @xmath4 @xcite . while all the other calculations are well in accord with the belle data , the predicted differential width @xmath21 disagrees with the belle measurement @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we will illustrate that the inclusion of these two @xmath8 states in the @xmath22 decays explains the puzzling line shape of @xmath21 very naturally .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> there exist three mechanisms for the @xmath4 hidden - bottom decays with the dipion emission @xmath23 the first one is the @xmath3 direct production by @xmath4 decay ( see fig </S>",
    "<S> . [ decay ] ( a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called direct production of @xmath24 denotes that there does not exist the contribution from the intermediate mesons ( such as @xmath25 , hadronic loop constructed by @xmath26 or @xmath27 mesons , @xmath8 ) to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the direct production of @xmath24 provides the background contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcd multipole expansion ( qme ) method @xcite is generally applied to deal with the dipion transition between heavy quarkonia . </S>",
    "<S> so far , there exist many theoretical efforts study the dipion transitions between the bottomonia @xcite ( see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a detailed review ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we do not intend to calculate the contribution from the direct transition under the framework of the qme method , but alternatively follow the effective lagrangian approach to describe @xmath24 transitions . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ direct ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are free parameters to be determined when fitting the experimental data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , the belle collaboration announced an exciting observation of two charged bottomonium - like states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath8 states are good candidates of exotic states , which calls for theoretical efforts in revealing their underlying structures . carrying out the phenomenological study relevant to @xmath0 and @xmath1 is one of the important and valuable issues of heavy quarkonium physics , which is full of challenges and opportunities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are related to the anomalous phenomena of @xmath3 production near @xmath4 previously reported by belle @xcite . comparing the fitting results without and with the contributions from the newly observed states , we notice that the intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath1 play a crucial role in the behavior of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contribution to @xmath10 provides a unique mechanism of understand the puzzling @xmath19 distribution of @xmath3 production near @xmath4 @xcite . the double - peak structure and its reflection in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath2 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> are also reproduced by this mechanism . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the values of the fitting parameters in our scenario are obtained by fitting belle data @xcite . to some extent , </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the values of these parameters is related to the understanding of background , the structures of two @xmath8 states etc , which is an interesting research topic .    besides finding the signals of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath41 decay channel , belle s analysis of its remaining four hidden - bottom decay channels @xmath11 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) also indicate the observation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present formalism can be extended to study the dipion invariant mass distribution and the @xmath19 distribution of @xmath43 and @xmath44 decay .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally , belle s measurement favors the @xmath17 and @xmath18 molecular explanation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the possible s - wave @xmath17 and @xmath18 molecular states were investigated extensively in refs . </S>",
