    "three - body atomic systems have attracted considerable interest due to the possibility of observing an intriguing property generally referred to as `` efimov physics ''  @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of efimov physics is the possibility of an infinity of three - body bound states even when none exist for the separate two - body subsystems .",
    "this occurs when the two - body scattering length @xmath6 is large compared to the characteristic range @xmath7 of the two - body interaction potential , which is typically on the order of tens of bohr radii .",
    "it is predicted that , in the limit of large scattering length ( therefore zero two - body binding energy ) , the atom - dimer scattering length also becomes large and the three - body system acquires an infinite series of bound states ( called efimov states ) whose energies form a geometric sequence with zero as an accumulation point .",
    "these phenomena persist even when @xmath8 is nonzero , so that we can expect to observe efimov physics in a real physical system .",
    "the theory of efimov physics was formulated in 1970  @xcite , but was experimentally confirmed only in 2006  @xcite , by exploiting a feshbach resonance in an ultracold gas of @xmath9cs atoms to adjust the scattering length .",
    "however , the evidence of efimov physics was seen in the three - body recombination rates , not by direct observation of bound states .",
    "it is therefore clear that understanding three - body recombination is crucial in establishing the extent to which efimov physics can be realized in the laboratory .",
    "helium has long been considered to be one of the most promising candidates for seeing efimov physics since the @xmath0he dimer has a large scattering length ( larger than 100 a.u . ) .",
    "the theoretical treatment of triatomic @xmath0he systems is simple compared to other atomic species because there exists only one dimer bound state which has zero orbital angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "several sophisticated helium dimer interaction potentials have been developed , of which the most widely used one is probably the lm2m2 potential by aziz and slaman  @xcite .",
    "this potential has been used to calculate various properties of the helium dimer and trimer  @xcite as well as their scattering observables  @xcite . the hfd - b3-fci1 potential developed by aziz _",

    "@xcite and cencek _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently developed not only a helium dimer potential , but also the retardation correction to the dimer potential and the nonadditive three - body term .",
    "retarded potentials have been used previously  @xcite and were found to have clear impacts on the low - energy behavior of helium systems .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0he dimer has been observed by luo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and by schllkopf and toennies  @xcite .",
    "the latter authors were able to see not only the helium dimer but also the trimer and tetramer .",
    "the @xmath0he trimer they observed was in its ground state , but no experiment has been able to see the excited state .",
    "there is actually much discussion currently whether one or both of these states should be considered efimov states , see refs .",

    "none of these previous works , however , presented all of these quantities . by doing so , we hope to benefit those applying effective field theory to this system .",

    "we extend the calculations up to @xmath13 using the new potential mentioned above .",
