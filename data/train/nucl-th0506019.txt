    "the role of strangeness in low and medium energy nuclear physics is currently of considerable interest , as it has the potential to deepen our understanding of the relevant strong interaction mechanisms in the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "for example , the system of a strange baryon ( hyperon @xmath8 ) and a nucleon ( @xmath9 ) is in principle an ideal testing ground for investigating the importance of su(3)@xmath10 symmetry in hadronic interactions .",
    "existing meson exchange models of the @xmath11 force usually assume su(3 ) symmetry for the hadronic coupling constants , and in some cases @xcite even the su(6 ) symmetry of the quark model .",
    "the symmetry requirements provide relations between couplings of mesons of a given multiplet to the baryon current , which greatly reduce the number of free model parameters .",
    "specifically , coupling constants at the strange vertices are then connected to nucleon - nucleon - meson coupling constants , which in turn are constrained by the wealth of empirical information on @xmath12 scattering .",
    "essentially all these @xmath11 interaction models can reproduce the existing @xmath11 scattering data , so that at present the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the coupling constants can not be ruled out by experiment .",
    "one should note , however , that the various models differ dramatically in the treatment of the scalar - isoscalar meson sector , which describes the baryon - baryon interaction at intermediate ranges .",
    "for example , the nijmegen group @xcite views this interaction as being generated by genuine scalar meson exchange . in their model d @xcite an @xmath13",
    "is exchanged as an su(3)@xmath14 singlet . in models",
    "f  @xcite , nsc  @xcite , and nsc97 @xcite a scalar su(3 ) nonet is exchanged  namely , two isospin-0 mesons ( besides the @xmath13 , the @xmath15 in model f and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in model nsc ( nsc97 ) ) , an isospin-1 meson ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) and an isospin-1/2 strange meson @xmath7 with a mass of 1000 mev .",
    "a genuine scalar su(3 ) nonet is also present in the so - called ehime potential @xcite , where besides the @xmath16 and @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 are included . in additon",
    "the model incorporates two effective scalar - meson exchanges , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that stand for @xmath24 and @xmath25 correlations but are treated phenomenologically .",
    "the tbingen model , on the other hand , which is essentially a constituent quark model supplemented by @xmath26 and @xmath2 exchange at intermediate and short ranges , treats the @xmath2 meson as an su(3 ) singlet with a mass of 520 mev @xcite or 675 mev @xcite , respectively . finally , in the quark - models of zhang et al .",
    "@xcite and fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite a scalar su(3 ) nonet is exchanged , though in this case between quarks and not between the baryons .    in the ( full ) bonn @xmath12 potential",
    "@xcite the intermediate range attraction is provided by uncorrelated and correlated @xmath4 exchange processes ( figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)(b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , respectively ) , with @xmath12 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 intermediate states . from earlier studies of the @xmath4 interaction",
    "it is known that @xmath4 correlations are important mainly in the scalar - isoscalar and vector - isovector channels . in one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials these",
    "are included effectively via exchange of sharp mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "one disadvantage of such a simplified treatment is that this parameterization can not be transferred into the hyperon sector in a well defined manner .",
    "therefore in the earlier @xmath11 interaction models of the jlich group  @xcite , which start from the bonn @xmath12 potential , the coupling constants of the fictitious @xmath2 meson at the strange vertices ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) are free parameters  a rather unsatisfactory feature of the models .",
    "this is especially true for the extension to the strangeness @xmath31 channels , interest in which initiated with the prediction of the h - dibaryon by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "these problems can be overcome by an explicit evaluation of correlated @xmath4 exchange in the various baryon - baryon channels .",
    "a corresponding calculation was initially done only for the @xmath12 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , but was extended in a recent paper @xcite by the jlich group so that now a full and consistent microscopic derivation of correlated @xmath4 exchange in various baryon - baryon ( @xmath32 ) channels with strangeness @xmath33 and @xmath34 is available .",
    "the starting point was a field theoretical model for both the @xmath35 born amplitudes and the @xmath4 and @xmath36 elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 channel is treated on an equal footing with the @xmath4 channel in order to reliably determine the influence of @xmath36 correlations in the relevant @xmath37-channels .",
    "then , with the help of unitarity and dispersion relations the amplitude for the correlated @xmath4 exchange in the @xmath12 channel but also for the @xmath11 and @xmath38 systems were computed .",
    "thus , within this approach one can replace the phenomenological @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchanges in the bonn @xmath12 @xcite and jlich @xmath11 @xcite models by correlated processes , i.e. eliminate undetermined parameters such as the @xmath39 coupling constants .",
    "in the present paper a new @xmath11 model is presented that utilizes this microscopic model of correlated @xmath4 and @xmath40 exchange to fix the contributions in the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath2 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath3 ) channels .",
    "the model incorporates also the standard one boson exchange contributions of the lowest pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets with coupling constants determined by su(6 ) symmetry relations . assuming the su(6 ) symmetry means that also the so - called @xmath41 ratios are fixed .",
    "in addition , there are further new ingrediations as compared to the original jlich @xmath11 model @xcite .",
    "first of all , the contribution from the @xmath19 meson is taken into account .",
    "secondly , we consider the exchange of a strange scalar meson , the @xmath7 , with mass @xmath42  mev .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that in analogy with the @xmath2 meson these particles are likewise not viewed as being members of a scalar meson su(3 ) multiplet , but rather as representations of strong meson - meson correlations in the scalar ",
    "isospin-1/2 ( @xmath43 ) @xcite and scalar  isovector ( @xmath44@xmath40 ) @xcite channels respectively . in principle , their contributions can also be evaluated along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , for simplicity in the present model they are effectively parameterized by one - boson - exchange diagrams with the appropriate quantum numbers assuming the coupling constants to be free parameters .    in the next two sections we describe the principal steps of the derivation of correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange potentials for the baryon ",
    "baryon amplitudes in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "in particular , in sect .",
    "2 we give a short outline of the microscopic model for the required @xmath45 amplitudes . the derivation of the potentials themselves is indicated in section 3 . furthermore , we introduce and discuss the parameterization of correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange potentials by an effective @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange for the @xmath11 channels .",
    "these effective parameterizations are then adopted for the construction of the new @xmath11 model . in sect .",
    "4 the other ingredients of our @xmath11 model are introduced .",
    "specifically , we comment on the employed strategy for fixing the parameters of the model .",
    "then we present and discuss numerical results of the model for @xmath11 scattering observables , phase shifts and effective range parameters .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section 5 .",
    "based on a @xmath47 amplitude the evaluation of diagrams such as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) for any @xmath32 system can be done in two steps .",
    "firstly the @xmath48 amplitudes are determined in the pseudophysical region ( @xmath49 ) and then dispersion theory and unitarity are applied to connect those amplitudes with the corresponding physical amplitudes in the various baryon - baryon channels .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a graphic representation of our dynamical model for correlated @xmath50 exchange . here",
    "@xmath51 stands for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54/@xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "formally the amplitudes for the processes @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 , @xmath36 ) are obtained from solving the scattering equation @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the @xmath61 ( coupled - channel ) reaction amplitude , @xmath62 the @xmath63 transition born amplitude and @xmath64 the free ( @xmath4 or @xmath40 ) green s function the first two quantities are the basic ingredients of the model . these amplitudes have to be known in the so - called pseudophysical region , i.e. for energies below the @xmath51 threshold . while for @xmath65 the corresponding amplitudes can be derived from empirical information on @xmath66 and @xmath4 scattering via an analytic continuation , this is not possible for the transitions @xmath67 .",
    "thus , a microscopic model for the @xmath68,@xmath36 is a pre - requisite for the evaluation of the correlated @xmath4 and @xmath40 exchange in the @xmath11 and @xmath38 channels .",
    "such a model was constructed by reuber et al . in ref .",
    "a main feature of this model is the completely consistent treatment of its two components , namely the @xmath69 born amplitudes and the @xmath4-@xmath36 correlations with respect to the @xmath2- and @xmath3-channels .",
    "both components are derived in field theory from an ansatz for the hadronic lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the considered contributions are briefly described in the subsections below .",
    "the subsequent evaluation of the baryon - baryon interaction via dispersion theory and unitarity is summarized in the next section .      the dynamical model used for the @xmath47 amplitudes",
    "is derived within the meson exchange framework and involves the @xmath4 and @xmath36 coupled channels @xcite .",
    "the driving terms for the diagonal interactions consist of ( @xmath37-channel ) exchange diagrams ( @xmath3 and @xmath3 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , respectively ) and ( @xmath72-channel ) pole diagrams with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 intermediate states .",
    "the coupling @xmath76 is provided by @xmath77 exchange .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the potentials derived from those diagrams are iterated in a coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger - type scattering equation .",
    "the free parameters of the @xmath47 model were adjusted to the empirical @xmath4 phase shifts and inelasticities . for details on the model and a comparision of the resulting @xmath4 phase shifts with experimental values",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the born amplitudes for the transition @xmath79 with @xmath80 are built up from an ( @xmath72-channel ) @xmath3-pole diagram and all possible diagrams involving the exchange of baryons out of the @xmath81 octet or the @xmath82 decuplet @xcite .",
    "for illustration we show in fig . [",
    "born ] those diagrams that contribute to the transition amplitude for @xmath83 .    in the construction of the model",
    "the number of free parameters has been kept to a minimum .",
    "specifically , the coupling constants at the various vertices involving the pseudoscalar mesons were fixed by su(6 ) symmetry relations .",
    "as far as the @xmath3-pole diagram is concerned the ( bare ) coupling constants and form factors at the @xmath84 and @xmath85 vertices were already determined in the model for the @xmath61 interaction @xcite and were taken over from there .",
    "then , assuming that the bare @xmath3-meson couples universally to the isospin current all vector couplings @xmath86 to the baryonic vertices were fixed as well .",
    "for the tensor couplings @xmath87 again",
    "su(6 ) symmetry relations were applied .",
    "the four remaining free parameters ( the tensor coupling constant @xmath88 , the parameter @xmath89 characterizing the strength of the off - shell part in the @xmath90 lagrangian , and form - factor parameters for the exchanged baryons for the octet and decuplet , respectively @xcite ) were fixed by adjusting the model predictions to the quasi - empirical information on the amplitudes @xmath91 obtained by hhler at el .  @xcite by analytically continuing the @xmath66 and @xmath92 scattering data . once this is done",
    "the model can be used to generate the amplitudes for any @xmath93 channel .",
    "though it should have become clear already from the discussion above , we want to emphasize again that the extrapolation of the model for the @xmath91 amplitudes to other channels depends crucially on the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the pseudo - scalar sector and it is based also on the hope that the correct description of the quasiempirical @xmath91 amplitudes guarantees a reasonable description of the other baryon - antibaryon channels , for which no empirical information is available .",
    "assuming analyticity for the amplitudes dispersion relations can be formulated for the baryon - baryon amplitudes , which connect physical amplitudes in the @xmath72-channel with singularities and discontinuities of these amplitudes in the pseudophysical region of the @xmath37-channel processes for the @xmath94 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath95 ( @xmath3 ) channel : @xmath96 via unitarity relations the singularity structure of the baryon - baryon amplitudes for @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange are fixed by and can be written as products of the @xmath45 amplitudes @xmath97 thus , from the @xmath98 helicity amplitudes the spectral functions can be calculated @xmath99 which are then inserted into dispersion integrals to obtain the ( on - shell ) baryon - baryon interaction : @xmath100 the underlying formalism is quite involved and has been outlined in detail already in ref .",
    "thus , we refrain from repeating it here . rather we want to provide only some more general information .",
    "since the dispersion - theoretical evaluation is restricted to the contribution of ( correlated ) @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange to the baryon - baryon amplitudes only those singularities are taken into account which are generated by @xmath4 and @xmath36 intermediate states , namely the discontinuities due to the @xmath4 and @xmath36 unitarity cut ( the so - called right - hand cut ) .",
    "the left - hand cuts , which are due to unitarity constraints for the @xmath101-channel reaction , can be neglected in the baryon - baryon channels considered here , since they start at large , negative @xmath37-values ( from which they extend to @xmath102 ) and are therefore far away from the physical region relevant for low - energy @xmath72-channel processes .",
    "the @xmath103 amplitudes , which enter in eq .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) are derived from a microscopic model which is based on the hadron - exchange picture , cf .",
    "ii . of course , this model has a limited range of validity : for energies far beyond @xmath104 it can not provide reliable results .",
    "the dispersion integral for the invariant amplitudes extending in principle along the whole @xmath4 right - hand cut has therefore to be limited to an upper bound , @xmath105 , which has been put to @xmath105 = 120  @xmath106 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the spectral function ( [ spectral ] ) for the ( @xmath107 ) @xmath2-channel has only one component but the one for the ( @xmath95 ) @xmath3-channel consists of four linearly independent components , which reflects the more complicated spin structure of this channel .",
    "finally , we should note that the helicity amplitudes obtained according to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] still generate the uncorrelated ( first diagram on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , as well as the correlated pieces ( second and third diagrams ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the contribution of the truely correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange one must eliminate the former from the spectral function .",
    "this is done by calculating the spectral function generated by the born term and subtracting it from the total spectral function : @xmath108 in practice this means that , e.g. , for the full bonn @xmath12 model contributions involving spin-1/2 as well as spin-3/2 baryons have to be subtracted since corresponding contributions are already treated explicitly in the s - channel in this model , namely via box diagrams with intermediate @xmath109-states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . on the other hand",
    "only uncorrelated contributions involving spin-1/2 baryons are to be subtracted from the discontinuities of the invariant baryon - baryon amplitudes in order to avoid double counting if a simple obe - model is used in the @xmath72-channel .",
    "this is the relevant procedure for the @xmath11 model that will be presented in the next section .",
    "note that the spectral functions characterize both the strength and range of the interaction .",
    "clearly , for sharp mass exchanges the spectral function becomes a @xmath18-function at the appropriate mass .    for convenience the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have presented their results in terms of effective coupling strengths , by parameterizing the correlated processes by ( sharp mass ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchanges .",
    "the interaction potential resulting from the exchange of a @xmath2 meson with mass @xmath110 between two @xmath111 baryons @xmath112 and @xmath113 has the structure : @xmath114 where a form factor @xmath115 is applied at each vertex , taking into account the fact that the exchanged @xmath2 meson is not on its mass shell .",
    "this form factor is parameterized in the conventional monopole form , @xmath116 with a cutoff mass @xmath117 assumed to be the same for both vertices .",
    "the correlated potential as given in eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) can now be parameterized in terms of @xmath37-dependent strength functions @xmath118 , so that for the @xmath2 case : @xmath119 the effective coupling constants are then defined as : @xmath120    similar relations can be also derived for the correlated exchange in the isovector - vector channel @xcite , which in this case will involve vector as well as tensor coupling pieces .",
    "it should be stressed that , so far , this parameterization does not involve any approximations as long as the full @xmath37-dependence of the effective coupling strengths is taken into account .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange have been chosen to have the same values in all particle channels .",
    "the masses @xmath110 and @xmath121 of the exchanged particles have been set to the values used in the bonn - jlich models of the @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath11  @xcite interactions ,   @xmath122 mev , @xmath123 mev .",
    "the cutoff masses @xmath124 and @xmath125 have been chosen so that the coupling strengths in the @xmath33 baryon - baryon channels vary only weakly with @xmath37 . the resulting values ( @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 gev )",
    "are quite large compared to the values of the phenomenological parameterizations used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and thus represent rather hard form factors .",
    "note that in the obe framework the contribution of a genuine ( su(3 ) ) @xmath2 meson to the three reactions @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 is determined by two parameters ( coupling constants ) , namely @xmath131 and @xmath132 , whereas the correlated exchange is characterized by three independent strength functions ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) so that vertex coupling constants can not be determined uniquely .",
    "this implies directly that the strength parameters can not fulfill su(3 ) relations .    in the physical region",
    "the strength of the contributions is to a large extent governed by the value of @xmath136 at @xmath137 .",
    "those values for the various channels were tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "tables 5 - 7 ) for the case of the full model calculation and also when uncorrelated contributions involving spin-1/2 baryons only are subtracted from the spectral function of the invariant baryon - baryon amplitudes .",
    "the latter are the proper values to be used for constructing a @xmath11 model based on simple obe - exchange diagrams .",

    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from table [ effr ] one can see that the scattering lengths in the @xmath141 @xmath0 partial wave ( @xmath142 ) are of similar magnitude for the old and new @xmath11 models , but in the @xmath143 state ( @xmath144 ) the new model yields a significantly larger value .",
    "the stronger @xmath143 component of the new model is reflected in the larger @xmath145 cross section near threshold , cf .",
    "[ cross ] , and it is expected to provide sufficient strength in order to support a bound hypertriton state @xcite . indeed",
    "recent @xmath11 models like nsc97f of the nijmegen group @xcite or the ehime model 00a @xcite , that apparently lead to a bound hypertriton @xcite , predict singlet scattering lengths that are very similar to that of our new model .",
    "in this context we want to mention that the static version of the old jlich @xmath11 model @xcite did not support a hypertriton bound state @xcite",
    ". however , in that model both the @xmath143 as well as the @xmath141 @xmath0 scattering lengths are considerably smaller @xcite than in our new @xmath11 model .",
    "the scattering lengths and effective ranges for @xmath1 with @xmath146 are complex because this channel is coupled to the @xmath0 system . in the singlet case",
    "the scattering lengths are comparable for the two models whereas in the triplet case they even have opposite signs .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that in both models the latter partial wave is attractive .",
    "but in the original jlich model the attraction is so strong that there is a near - threshold quasibound state in the @xmath1 channel that causes the real part of @xmath142 to be positive - like in case of the corresponding @xmath12 partial wave and the deuteron .",
    "let us mention that practically the same situation occurs in the nijmegen model nsc97f , whose pole structure has been investigated and thoroughly discussed in ref . @xcite . as a consequence of the near - threshold pole",
    "both these models yield a very pronounced cusp - like structure in the @xmath145 cross section at the opening of the @xmath1 channel , cf .",
    "[ cross ] and fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . in our new @xmath11 model ,",
    "on the other hand , the cusp at the @xmath1 threshold is much less pronounced .",
    "note that the @xmath143 partial wave is attractive too . as already mentioned above",
    ", in the original jlich model there is a bound state in the @xmath1 channel  as evidenced by the broad bump in the @xmath145 cross section around @xmath147 350 mev / c .",
    "and the new @xmath11 model has also a bound state which is located , however , around 400 mev below the @xmath0 threshold and therefore completely outside of the physically relevant region .",
    "let us finally come to the @xmath1 channel with @xmath148 . here",
    "we see that the singlet scattering length of the new model is about twice as large as the one of the original jlich model .",
    "note that a comparably large singlet scattering length is also predicted by all of the @xmath11 models presented in ref .",
    "the scattering lengths for @xmath141 are small in both cases , but of opposite sign .",
    "now , however , it is indeed so that our new @xmath11 model is repulsive in this partial wave whereas the old model is attractive .",
    "it is interesting that basically all available @xmath11 models predict rather small values for the spin - triplet scattering length of the @xmath1 @xmath148 channel @xcite , though there is no general trend as far as the sign is concerned .",
    "we also observe an unnaturally large value for the triplet effective range , which is clearly related to the strong suppression of the corresponding scattering length .",
    "such a scenario will require special attention when this channel is considered in effective field theory ( for further discussion , see sec .",

    "[ phases ] and those for @xmath151-waves can be found in fig .",
    "[ phases1 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath149-wave phase shifts reflect the features that we already discussed in the context of the scattering lengths .",
    "for example one can see that the phase shift for the @xmath141 @xmath152 state starts at 180@xmath153 for the original jlich model , as it is expected for a partial wave where a bound state is present . for the @xmath154 state",
    "the corresponding phase is positive , reflecting an attractive interaction , whereas the phase shift resulting from the new @xmath11 model is negative .",
    "note that the phases for @xmath143 and @xmath152 should both start at 180@xmath153 because , as mentioned above , there is a bound state in both models .",
    "the opening of the @xmath1 channel at around @xmath155 170 mev is cleary reflected in the @xmath141 phase shift of the @xmath0 system .",
    "but its effect on the @xmath156 phase shift is even more striking where , for the old jlich model , the phase even goes through 90 degrees .",
    "in fact , the resonance - like behaviour in that partial wave is predominantly responsible for the strong enhancement of the @xmath0 cross section in the vicinity of the @xmath1 threshold , cf .",
    "[ cross ] .",
    "in addition , the transition amplitude @xmath157 provides a significant contribution to the @xmath158 cross section . in the new model",
    "the @xmath156 phase shift of the @xmath0 system is much smaller .",
    "accordingly , the cusp - like structure at the @xmath1 threshold is much less pronounced and the @xmath158 cross section is somewhat reduced in this model , as can be seen in fig . [ cross ] .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath151 waves ( fig .",
    "[ phases1 ] ) show a varying picture . in the @xmath0 system",
    "most of the phases are now attractive whereas they are mostly repulsive for the old model .",
    "this concerns in particular the @xmath159 amplitude , which is fairly large in the new model , but also the @xmath160 partial wave . in the @xmath154 channel of the @xmath1 system",
    "the results of the two models are qualitatively rather similar .",
    "to some extent this is also the case for the @xmath152 channel though here the @xmath161 amplitude of the new @xmath11 model is significantly larger than the one of the old jlich model .",
    "indeed the simultaneous enhancement in the @xmath161 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath159 ( @xmath0 ) phase shifts is caused by a stronger antisymmetric spin - orbit force between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels in the new model .",
    "the increase is primarily due to the @xmath3 exchange contribution whose strength for the @xmath162 transition , fixed from correlated @xmath47 exchange , is about twice as large as what was used in the old jlich model , cf .",
    "table 11 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this context",
    "let us mention that some other @xmath11 models exhibit a similarly strong coupling between those partial waves and channels @xcite .",
    "we have presented a meson - exchange model of the @xmath11 interaction where  as the main new feature  the contributions both in the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath2 ) and the vector - isovector ( @xmath3 ) channels are constrained by a microscopic model of correlated @xmath4 and @xmath40 exchange .",
    "an essential part of baryon - baryon interactions is the strong medium - range attraction , which in one - boson - exchange models is parameterized by exchange of a fictitious scalar - isoscalar meson with mass around 500 mev . in extended meson exchange models this part",

    "@xcite , which provide an excellent description of empirical @xmath4 data up to 1.3 gev . with the help of unitarity and dispersion - theoretical methods , the baryon - baryon amplitudes for correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange in the @xmath164 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath165 ( @xmath3 ) @xmath37-channels have then been determined . with this model",
    "it is possible to reliably take into account correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels for various baryon - baryon reactions . given the strong constraints on @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 exchange from correlated @xmath4 exchange , a more sound microscopic model for the @xmath11 interaction can hence now be constructed .",
    "besides contributions from correlated @xmath4 and @xmath36 exchange the present model incorporates also the standard one - boson exchanges of the lowest pseudoscalar and vector meson multiplets with coupling constants fixed by su(6 ) symmetry relations .",
    "thus , in the present model the long- and intermediate - range part of the @xmath11 interaction is completely determined  either by su(6 ) constraints or by correlated @xmath4 and @xmath40 exchange .",
    "in addition there are some short - ranged ingredients .",
    "first of all , the contribution from the @xmath19 meson is taken into account . secondly , we consider the exchange of a strange scalar meson , the @xmath7 , with mass @xmath42  mev .",
    "( note that these pieces were not taken into account in the earlier @xmath11 models of the jlich group @xcite . )",
    "these short - ranged contributions are also viewed as being due to correlated meson - meson exchanges but in practice they are parametrized phenomelogically in terms of one - boson - exchange contributions in the corresponding spin - isospin channels .",
    "in particular , no su(3 ) relations are imposed on the short - range part .",
    "this assumption is based on our observation that the contributions in the @xmath3 exchange channel as they result from correlated @xmath4 and @xmath166 no longer fulfill su(3 ) relations , but it also acknowledges the fact that at present there is no general agreement about who are the actual members of the lowest - lying scalar meson su(3 ) multiplet .",
    "the new @xmath11 model provides a rather satisfactory reproduction of the available @xmath11 data .",
    "it describes not only the integrated cross sections for @xmath145 and the various @xmath1 channels but also the few available data on differential cross sections , even though the latter were not included in the fitting procedure .",
    "we see that as an indication that the data are compatible with the assumption of su(6 ) symmetry for the pseudoscalar sector of our @xmath11 model .    as the main qualitative difference between the old @xmath11 jlich model @xcite ( with standard @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange ) we want to mention that the broad shoulder at @xmath147 350 mev / c in the @xmath167 channel , predicted by that model but not seen in the experiments , is no longer present in the new model .",
    "but , as a more detailed comparison revealed , there are also striking differences between these two models in the predictions for the individual partial waves .",
    "for example , in the new model the triplet @xmath149 wave in the @xmath154 channel of the @xmath1 system is repulsive and some of the @xmath151-wave amplitudes are significantly larger .",
    "thus , it will be interesting to see the performance of the new @xmath11 interaction model in applications to few- and many - body systems involving hyperons @xcite",
    ".    this study also paves the way for a systematic investigation in the framework of effective field theory , see @xcite .",
    "in such a framework , pion- and kaon exchange supplemented by four - baryon contact interactions ( these encode the contributions from the exchange of heavier mesons not linked to chiral symmtery ) is considered to generate a potential based on the power counting rules .",
    "it remains to be seen how well such a more systematic approach can indeed describe the data and what conclusions can be drawn about three - baryon forces that naturally arise in such a framework .",
    "we thank j.  speth and w.  melnitchouk for collaboration during the early stages of this investigation .",
    "we also thank a. nogga for a careful reading of our manuscript .",
