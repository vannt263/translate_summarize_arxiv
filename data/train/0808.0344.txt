    "there is a general consensus that the highest energy cosmic rays ( cr ) are of extragalactic origin because they reach the earth with an approximately isotropic angular distribution .",
    "the magnetic fields of the milky way are not sufficiently strong and extended to randomize the directions of particles produced by our own galaxy , and the this isotropy of these cr is likely to reflect the large scale homogeneity of the universe .",
    "it is natural to expect that the extragalactic ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are produced in `` point  like '' astrophysical sources .",
    "the identification of these sources , and the clarification of the mechanisms that accelerate particles to these very large energies is clearly one of the crucial goals of the new large acceptance air shower detectors like the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the trajectories of charged particles is bent by the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields , however at sufficiently large rigidity @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the particle electric charge ) the magnetic deviations should become sufficiently small to allow the direct imaging of sources with cosmic rays .",
    "unfortunately the intensity and structure of the intergalactic magnetic field are very poorly known , and therefore the region ( in source distance and particle energy ) where cr astronomy is possible remains very uncertain .",
    "it is possible ( and there are observational hints ) that the cr above @xmath2  ev are already propagating in quasi ",
    "linear mode for source distances of order 100  mpc or more , however the identification of the sources remains difficult because of the very small number of events available , with most of the sources contributing with not more than a single event .",
    "the analysis of the `` clustering '' of the observed events can give information about the luminosity of the individual sources .",
    "after the data of agasa @xcite gave hints of possible clustering .",
    "this question has received a significant amount of attention @xcite . in this work",
    "we want to make a more quantitative and detailed study on how to interpret the results on the clustering .",
    "the nature of the particles in the uhecr remains a central open questions in the field . in this work",
    "we will assume that most of these particles are protons .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the existing data ( if one takes into account the systematic uncertainties on the modeling of hadronic showers ) and it is also favored in most theoretical models .",
    "here this assumption is also made to allow a detailed quantitative description of particle propagation in intergalactic space , which is essential for the problem we are considering .",
    "it is possible and reasonably straightforward to generalize the discussion to the case of nuclei .",
    "all cosmic ray sources are unavoidably also sources of neutrinos @xcite because some fraction of a population of relativistic hadrons will necessarily interact with ordinary matter or radiation fields targets inside or near their acceleration site creating pions and other weakly decaying particles that can ( chain ) decay into neutrinos .",
    "viceversa , the emission of neutrinos imply the existence of relativistic hadrons , and therefore the acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "the catalogues of the cr and neutrino sources are in principle identical . in practice",
    "the situation could more complicated , because the energy range studied by the cr and neutrino telescopes differ by several orders of magnitude , and the relation between the neutrino and cosmic ray emission from a source can vary significantly depending on the structure of the source , and it is certainly possible to have bright cr sources that emit a relatively small amount of neutrinos , and viceversa .",
    "nonetheless , it is reasonable to expect that the brighest extragalactic sources of both cr and neutrinos will coincide , and it is interesting to discuss in parallel these new astronomies .    also in the case of neutrinos one can measure an inclusive flux , that sums the contributions from all sources in the universe , while the brightest and most powerful neutrino sources should be identifiable as individual objects .",
    "therefore also for neutrinos the `` clustering '' of the detected events is a useful method of study .",
    "an important advantage is that for neutrinos linear propagation is certain , but one has to deal with the existence of the foreground of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the theoretical framework needed to discuss the clustering of neutrino events is essentially identical to the one needed for protons .",
    "a quantitative difference is that for neutrinos extragalactic space is perfectly transparent , and the inclusive flux receives most of its contribution from very distant and very faint sources , and the fraction of this flux that can be `` resolved '' in the contribution of identified sources is likely to be small .",
    "more that the interpretation of the existing data , the goal of this work is the development of some general analysis instruments that can be used in the study of future , higher statistics results .    this work is organized as follows : in the next section we make a preliminary discussion of the so called `` olbers paradox '' .",
    "the discussion of this celebrated puzzle allows to introduce the key concepts needed to compute the signal from the ensemble of all sources in the universe . in section  3",
    "we collect the results on particle propagation in intergalactic space that are needed in the following .",
    "section  4 discusses how the flux received from one astrophysical source depends on its redshift .",
    "section  5 discusses possible forms of the luminosity function of the proton and neutrino sources .",
    "section  6 compute the inclusive particle flux from the combined emission of all sources in the universe .",
    "section  7 discusses what part of the inclusive flux can be resolved in the contribution of individual sources .",
    "section  8 applies these analysis instruments to the interpretation of the recent auger data .",
    "section  9 discusses extragalactic neutrino astronomy .",
    "section  10 gives some conclusions .",
    "in 1610 kepler was the first to note that the darkness of the night sky seems to imply that the universe is finite , or at least contains a finite number of stars .",
    "this point was later rediscussed by several authors , and is commonly known in the formulation of henrich olbers in 1823 .",
    "the so called `` olbers paradox '' is the statement that in an infinite , homogeneous and static universe the surface of the celestial sphere should be infinitely bright .",
    "a derivation of this result is elementary . in euclidean space ,",
    "the relation between the apparent ( @xmath3 ) and absolute ( @xmath4 ) luminosity of a source placed at a distance @xmath5 ( neglecting photon absorption ) is : @xmath6 an homogeneous ensemble of identical sources of density @xmath7 produces then an inclusive energy flux per unit of solid angle @xmath8 that diverges linearly because every spherical layer contained in the interval [ @xmath9 $ ] gives an equal contribution : @xmath10    assuming the same homogeneous distribution of identical sources , one can also consider the number of objects in the sky that have apparent luminosity in the interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath12 can be easily calculated as : @xmath13_{r=\\sqrt { \\frac{l}{4 \\ , \\pi } } }   =   4 \\ , \\pi ~ n_s~ \\left ( \\frac{l}{4 \\ , \\pi } \\right ) ^{3/2 }    ~ \\frac { \\ell^{-5/2}}{2 } ~ ,   \\label{eq : g0a}\\ ] ] a result that is also often stated in its integral form : @xmath14 that has the obvious geometrical meaning of the number of sources contained in a sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "the infinite brightness of the sky is due to the `` exploding '' number of very faint sources .",
    "in fact for @xmath16 the number of observed sources diverges @xmath17 , and correspondingly the integrated energy flux diverges as @xmath18 .",
    "these elementary results can be also restated in an adimensional form , and in terms of particle fluxes instead of energy fluxes .",
    "we consider identical sources emitting @xmath19 particles per unit time , and choose a reference length @xmath20 ( here the choice of @xmath20 is completely arbitrary , in the following it will be natural to identify @xmath20 with the hubble length ) .",
    "the particle flux received from a source placed at the distance @xmath20 is : @xmath21 using the notation : @xmath22 and @xmath23 one can rewrite equations ( [ eq : f0a ] ) and ( [ eq : g0a ] ) in the equivalent adimensional form : @xmath24 @xmath25 in equations ( [ eq : f0b ] ) and ( [ eq : g0b ] ) we have introduced the two functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath28 can be called the `` dimming function '' , and describes how the flux from a source decreases as its distance increases .",
    "the function @xmath29 can be called the `` flux distribution function '' and describes how the number of observable sources depends on the size of their flux .",
    "summing over all sources , the inclusive flux per unit solid angle ( as well as the inclusive energy flux ) diverges ; however it still formally possible to write an expression for the inclusive flux as an integral over the scaled distance @xmath30 : @xmath31 the function @xmath32 can be called the `` kepler  olbers function '' , and gives the contribution of the spherical shell between ( scaled ) distance @xmath30 and @xmath33 to the inclusive flux .",
    "in general there is an integral relation between @xmath34 and @xmath27 : @xmath35 that is easily understood , noting that both sides of the equation describe the particle flux generated inside a sphere around the observer of ( scaled ) radius @xmath30 .",
    "it is obvious that the three functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath34 are related to each other and , given one of the three , the other two can be deduced taking into account the hypothesis of static , euclidean space . for example , if the `` dimming function '' has the general form @xmath26 the functions @xmath27 and @xmath34 can be calculated as : @xmath36_{x = f^{-1}(z ) } \\label{eq : gg1}\\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the volume contained in the spherical shell @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "in fact equations ( [ eq : gg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kk1 ] ) remain true for a realistic cosmological model , replacing the volume element @xmath40 with the correct general relativity expression of equation ( [ eq : dvol ] ) .",
    "the `` kepler  olbers paradox '' is `` solved '' , and we observe a finite energy flux even if our universe is ( to a very good approximation ) euclidean , ( nearly certainly ) infinitely large and homogeneous , because the additional condition of a static , unchanging universe is false .",
    "the calculation of the inclusive flux from the ensemble of all extra ",
    "galactic sources must obviously take into account the expansion of the universe , and the consequent ( redshift ) energy loss of all particles .",
    "in addition the particles can lose energy also for other mechanism that must be taken into account . with the inclusion of the cosmological and energy loss effects",
    "the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath34 take more complex forms that are different the simple result : @xmath41 that is valid for a static , euclidean space universe , and in the absence of energy losses .",
    "the form of the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath34 in a realistic cosmological model depend on the particle type , the particle energy and encode also the shape of the emission spectrum ( and clearly also the parameters that control the expansion of the universe ) , however the solution ( [ eq : sol0 ] ) will always emerge as the universal asymptotic form for small redshift ( @xmath42 ) and the largest fluxes ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the modifications have the consequence that the inclusive particle flux , obtained integrating over all possible sources , remains finite .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : int0 ] ) remains valid also in the limit of @xmath44 ( and corresponding @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 the result of the integration in ( [ eq : int1 ] ) is finite and equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath47 can be understood qualitatively as the equivalent linear size ( in units of the hubble scale length @xmath20 ) of the universe that contributes to the flux @xmath48 , or equivalently as the effective number of hubble times ( @xmath49 ) that contribute to the flux injection .",
    "in this work we will describe the energy losses of neutrinos and protons propagating in extra  galactic space as a continuous deterministic process described by the function @xmath50 that depends on the particle energy and on the epoch @xmath30 .",
    "the assumption of continuous energy loss is essentially exact for neutrinos , that lose energy only because of the redshift effect , but is also a good approximation for protons . integrating the energy loss over time it is possible to compute the evolution with time ( or redshift ) of the energy of a particle constructing the function @xmath51 that returns the energy at redshift @xmath52 of a particle with energy @xmath53 at redshift @xmath54 : @xmath55 neutrinos , to a very good approximation , only lose energy for the redshift effect , and their energy evolution is : @xmath56 it is particularly important to know the energy at a past epoch @xmath30 of a particle that is observed `` now '' with energy @xmath57 .",
    "this is a particular case of the general relation ( [ eq : e_evol ] ) and can be indicated ( propagating backward in time ) as : @xmath58 for neutrinos one obviously has : @xmath59    the propagation of protons in intergalactic space has been discussed in several works , after the pioneering work of greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite and is now well understood . together with the redshift losses one has to include losses due to interactions with the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "the two important processes are pair production interactions ( @xmath60 ) and inelastic hadronic interactions ( with the threshold processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) . the results of a numerical calculation of @xmath63 for protons are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : e_evol ] .",
    "the different curves correspond to the `` backward in time '' evolution of protons detected `` now '' with @xmath57 between @xmath64  ev and @xmath65  ev .",
    "note that the time evolution of the proton energy is completely independent from the structure and intensity of the magnetic fields , because these fields can only bend the trajectory of charged particles , and the target radiation field is isotropic .",
    "obviously , if the particles do not travel in straight lines , the redshift @xmath30 has no simple relation with the distance of the particle source , but only describes the time of the particle emission .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : e_evol ] shows that for each observed energy @xmath57 there is a critical redshift where the energy evolution @xmath66 `` explodes '' , starting to grow faster than an exponential . at this critical redshift",
    "the universe , filled now with a hotter and denser radiation field , has become opaque to the propagation of the protons .",
    "the form of the redshift evolution of the proton energy suggests the introduction of the concept of a redshift `` horizon '' .",
    "the implicit equation : @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 the maximum energy with which protons are produced in their sources ) can be used as a definition of the redshift horizon @xmath69 .",
    "an illustration of this definition of the redshift horizon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zhor ] .",
    "the redshift horizon becomes progressively smaller when the energy @xmath57 grows .",
    "when @xmath57 becomes a few times 10@xmath70  ev the `` shrinking '' of the horizon with increasing @xmath57 accelerates sharply . at this",
    "`` gzk '' energy the protons start interacting with the photons of the background radiation in the _ present _ universe , and not only with the higher energy photons of a hotter past . above this critical `` gzk energy ''",
    "the definition of the horizon with equation ( [ eq : zh0 ] ) strongly depends on the `` maximum acceleration energy '' ( that is not a priori a well defined concept ) and therefore loses most of its usefulness .",
    "a better definition of the proton horizon will be given later in equation ( [ eq : zhor ] ) .",
    "protons are charged particles , and therefore their trajectories are bent by magnetic fields .",
    "astronomy with protons is therefore possible only in a limited region of source distance and particle energy so that the observed deviations are acceptably small .",
    "the size of this region is determined by the strength and structure the astrophysical magnetic fields .    neglecting the deviations due to to magnetic fields in the vicinity of the source and in the milky way halo , the deviation of a charged particle traveling in intergalactic space for a distance @xmath71",
    "can be described ( in the limit of small deviation ) with the expression @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the larmor radius , @xmath74 is the typical value of the extra ",
    "galactic magnetic field and @xmath75 is its coherence length . in ( [ eq : mag_dev ] ) the magnetic deviation is modeled as the incoherent sum of contributions received in `` magnetic domains '' , where the field has different orientation . in this simple model , the angular deviation accumulated by a proton of energy @xmath57 from a source at distance",
    "@xmath71 scales @xmath76 , with an absolute value controled by the combination @xmath77 .    if we require an image with an angular resolution better that @xmath78 , for a given energy @xmath57 we must limit our observations to distances smaller than an `` imaging radius '' : @xmath79 alternatively to produce an image with resolution @xmath78 of a source at a distance @xmath71 one must select a threshold energy @xmath80 @xmath81    the combination @xmath82 is therefore the crucial parameter that controls the perspectives of extragalactic cosmic ray astronomy .",
    "the best ( and perhaps today the only ) way to estimate @xmath83 and determine where cr astronomy is possible is in fact the observation of uhecr and the use of equation ( [ eq : mag_dev ] ) . at present",
    "however the estimate of @xmath83 remains very poorly known .",
    "the recent results of the auger collaboration @xcite indicates that the directions of the highest energy events ( @xmath84  ev ) are correlated with the positions of close agn s , selected with a redhift cut @xmath85 that corresponds to @xmath86  mpc , using a correlation cone of opening angle @xmath87 .",
    "the simplest ( `` nominal '' ) interpretation of these results is that the highest energy cr are in fact produced in these agn ( or in sources very strongly correlated in position ) and arrive with a magnetic deviation of less than 3.1@xmath88 .",
    "this is a remarkable result that , attributing all of the observed deviation to the intergalactic propagation ( that is neglecting the contributions of the source envelope and of the milky way ) , allows to set an upper limit on the combination @xmath83 that describes the extragalactic magnetic field : @xmath89 assuming that the particles are protons , this implies the imaging radius : @xmath90 this result , if confirmed , indicates that cr astronomy should be able to give important results in the very near future .",
    "the `` nominal interpretation '' of the auger results , suffers from several difficulties both internally ( see for example the criticism in @xcite ) and comparing with the observations of other detectors ( for the yakutsk data see @xcite for the hires data see @xcite ) .",
    "the consensus is that the auger results do indicate the existence of an anisotropy of the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays , but the origin of the anisotropy has not been established , the significance of the 3.1 degrees of the opening of the correlation cone is therefore ambiguous and the estimates ( [ eq : estim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : r_imaginga ] ) only tentative .",
    "a remarkable fact of the auger results is that two of the highest energy events are in correlation ( using the 3.1@xmath88 cone ) with the nearby ( @xmath91  pc ) agn cen  a. taking into account the fact that cen  a has been often discussed as one of the most likely sources of uhecr this is a striking result , that suggests that the first extragalactic cr source has in fact already been imaged .",
    "there are also indications that cen  a could be the source of a larger number of events with a larger angular spread ( see for example the remarks in @xcite ) .",
    "for example a 20 degrees cone around cen  a contains 9  events .",
    "such a large contribution from cen  a could account for a significant fraction of the observed anisotropy effect .",
    "these observations could however also a dramatic impact on the estimate of the extragalactic magnetic field , because they suggest a larger deviation ( @xmath92 ) for a shorter distance .",
    "the estimate for the combination @xmath93 becomes therefore larger by a factor of order 200 : @xmath94 with a correspondingly smaller imaging radius , and significantly restricting the potential of cr astronomy for more distant sources .",
    "additional data should allow to clarify this ambiguous situation .",
    "the discrimination between the two estimates ( [ eq : estim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : estim2 ] ) for the parameter that describes the extragalactic magnetic field is obviously crucial for the future of the field .",
    "let us consider a source that emits isotropically particles with the energy spectrum described by the function @xmath95 .",
    "the emitted particles travel , at least in good approximation , along geodetic trajectories losing energy continuously . propagating backward in time , a particle that is observed `` now '' with energy @xmath57 , at the time that correspond to redshift @xmath30 had energy @xmath96 .",
    "the flux received from such a source placed at the distance that corresponds to redshift @xmath30 can be written as : @xmath97 where : @xmath98 is the hubble length , and the adimensional function @xmath99 is given by : @xmath100}{q(e ) }    ~     \\frac{de_g(e , z)}{de } ~. \\label{eq : f_gen}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ eq : f_gen ] ) @xmath96 is the emission energy ( at the source ) of the particles observed with energy @xmath57 , and @xmath101 is the ( adimensional ) comoving coordinate that corresponds to the redshift @xmath30 : @xmath102 with @xmath103 the ( scaled ) hubble parameter at the epoch of redshift @xmath30 : @xmath104 the expansion of the universe , and the redshift dependence of the hubble constant are determined by the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the `` dimming function '' @xmath99 describes how the flux of a source weakens , and ( in general ) has its energy spectrum distorted when the redshift @xmath30 increases .",
    "the function is the generalization of gauss law ( @xmath107 behaviour ) that is valid for static , euclidean space in the absence of energy loss . for small @xmath30 cosmological and energy loss effects become negligible and the function @xmath99 takes the simple asymptotic form @xmath108 .",
    "the form of the function @xmath99 is determined by the cosmological parameters ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) and from the shape of the emission spectrum . in principle",
    "an unambiguous notation should include these additional dependences : @xmath109 . for simplicity , in this work we will leave the dependence on the cosmological parameters and the shape of the emission function implicit .",
    "a relation analogous to ( [ eq : phi_gen ] ) can also be written for the integral spectrum : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the integral source emission : @xmath112 the function @xmath113 ( for the integral flux ) can be obtained from @xmath99 ( for the differential flux ) with the integration : @xmath114 for @xmath42 , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath115 takes again the simple form @xmath116 .    for neutrinos , and more in general in all cases",

    "the function @xmath125 for neutrinos is shown in figure  [ fig : nu1 ] .",
    "the function depends on the value of the cosmological parameters @xmath105 and @xmath127 , and of the value of the slope @xmath124 .",
    "one can see that @xmath125 coincides with the form @xmath116 for @xmath128 , and then begins to fall more rapidly suppressing the flux of very distant sources .",
    "the `` dimming function '' for proton sources depends very strongly on the proton energy .",

    "[ fig : f_prot ] where the redshift dependence of the function @xmath129 is shown for several value of the threshold energy @xmath130 , assuming again a power law emission spectrum .",
    "one can clearly see that a proton source becomes rapidly unobservable when it becomes more distant than a rather sharply defined `` horizon '' that shrinks rapidly with energy for @xmath131 to @xmath132  ev , and is much smaller that the hubble length .",
    "in this work we will make the assumption that all astrophysical sources have emission of the same shape and differ only for their absolute luminosity .",
    "the idea behind this assumption is that the emission mechanism is likely to be universal , independent from the properties of the individual sources .",
    "an example of this situation is the acceleration of cosmic rays near the blast waves of supernova ( sn ) explosions , where it is believed that particles are accelerated with a power law spectrum @xmath133 with a slope @xmath134 that is essentially independent from the properties of an individual sn ( for example the mass and initial velocity of the ejected material ) , but it is determined only by the ( universal ) compression factor of the interstellar gas after the passage of a strong shock front .",
    "this assumption of a `` universal '' spectral shape is of course an hypothesis that could very well be incorrect .",
    "this possibility is in fact likely to the uhe proton sources , since it is in fact natural to expect that different sources have different high energy cutoffs , and that these cutoffs are in the energy range where the spectra are measured . after these words of warning",

    "in this situation however , the source bolometric luminosity is not unambiguously defined because the integral @xmath138 is always divergent ( at the upper limit for @xmath139 , and at the lower limit for @xmath140 ) . in other words ,",
    "an unbroken power law emission is impossible , and to estimate the bolometric luminosity of a source it is necessary to specify the range of validity of the power law form , and the behaviour of the spectrum outside this region .",

    "the radius of the sphere within which a source of luminosity @xmath150 is sufficiently bright to generate a multiplet grows approximately @xmath347 , accordingly the volume that contains multiplets grows @xmath348 ; on the other hand , for a fixed luminosity density the number density of the sources is @xmath349 , with the combined result @xmath350 .",
    "this behaviour stops when the radius of detection of a source becomes comparable with the `` horizon radius '' of order @xmath351 .",
    "additional increase in @xmath150 decreases the number of the multiplets , since the detection volume remains approximately constant while the source number density decreases .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality between @xmath338 and @xmath352 depends linearly on the factors @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",

    "the factor @xmath357 is unity if all sources have the same luminosity ; for the broad luminosity distribution ( [ eq : lum_shape ] ) @xmath358 .",
    "it is intuitive that a broad luminosity distribution ( with large @xmath354 ) yields a larger number of multiplets than a narrow one thanks to the contribution of high luminosity sources in the tail of the distribution .    in the regime of validity of equation ( [ eq : multiplets ] ) it is possible to obtain @xmath150 with a simple , closed form expression as a function of @xmath359 and @xmath338 solving the system composed of equations ( [ eq : nev ] ) and ( [ eq : multiplets ] ) : @xmath360 ^ 2}{\\eta ~(a_\\omega \\ ; t ) } ~ \\frac{1}{\\langle a^{3/2 } \\rangle^2 }   ~ \\frac{1}{\\langle y^{3/2 } \\rangle^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the number of events observed in auger one finds : @xmath361 note that in the regime of validity of this equation the number of multiplets grows with time as : @xmath362 , while the number of events is @xmath363 , therefore the combination [ @xmath364 is a constant .",
    "the behaviour @xmath365 loses is validity for @xmath366  erg / s , when sources not too distant from the energy loss horizon begin to be visible .",
    "the question of how the 27 highest energy events detected by auger can be subdivided into the contribution of different sources has not a simple answer , and is intimately related to the problem of the the deviations of the particles during their propagation and the size of the extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the `` nominal interpretation '' of the auger events , suggests that particles with @xmath367  eev are deviated by approximately 3 degrees , and therefore that the clustering of events should be searched for using a correlation cone of approximately this size .",
    "if one tentatively accepts this conclusion , defining a cluster as a set of events with angular separation less than a @xmath368 , one finds 2 doublets and correspondingly 23 singlets . increasing the size of the correlation cone to 5@xmath88",
    "one finds one triplet and three doublets , while the 18 remaining events are singlets .",
    "these numbers should be corrected for the effect of random coincidences that in turn depends on the assumptions about the larger scale angular distribution of the flux .",
    "taken at face value these results , together with the the calculations shown in figure  [ fig : auger1 ] suggest an allowed range for the luminosity @xmath150 : @xmath369 the lower limit follows from the fact that ( at a modest confidence level ) some clustering is observed .",
    "the upper limit follows from the fact that most of the events are actually in singlets , and that the total number of objects that contribute to the signal is larger than @xmath370 .",
    "in fact the auger data suggest that at least one source of uhecr has been established with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "the position of the very close active galactic nucleus cen  a coincides with the most prominent of all tentative clustering structures ( the triplet found for a 5@xmath88 aperture cone ) . considering that cen",
    "a , on the basis of its properties and closeness to the earth , has been proposed as one of the most likely sources of uhecr this is a striking result .",
    "the detection of cen  a is an remarkable result of historic importance .",
    "it is the first imaging of an astrophysical object with charged particles and , 4 centuries after the invention of the optical telescope and 20 years after the detection of sn1987a with neutrinos , marks the birth of a new astronomy .",
    "the clarification of the size and structure of the excess of events from the cen  a direction is very important to evaluate the perspectives of the field of cr astronomy .",
    "in fact it is possible that cen  a accounts for a number of events larger than 2 or 3 .",
    "for example a 10@xmath88 ( @xmath371 ) cone around the direction of cen  a contains 4 ( 9 ) events , suggesting that the excess from this direction is larger and more extended .",
    "it should be stressed that cen  a is remarkably close to us with a distance of only 3.5  pc . since the deviations of a particle during propagation in intergalactic space scales as @xmath372 ( with @xmath71 the sorce distance ) a signal with an angular size of several degrees from cen",
    "a suggest that astronomy from sources at larger distances will be very difficult and require higher energies .",
    "the result is also in possible conflict with the correlation cone of 3.2 degrees found between the direction of the highest energy cosmic ray and the position of agn with @xmath373 found in @xcite since the distance of these agn is typically 20 times larger , and the expected deviation of particles produced in sources is expected to be 4 times larger .",
    "there are several solution to this problem : the apparent large angular size of the event excess in the direction of cen  a could be due to the contributions of other sources in the same portion of the sky ; the large angular deviations could be the effect of strong magnetic fields in the vicinity of the source and not in intergalactic space ( but of course this should then be expected for a significant fraction of all the other sources ) ; the angular spread of the signal could be associated with the size of the emission region from cen  a that has jets extending several degrees away from its nucleus .",
    "it could however also mean that the intergalactic magnetic fields are stronger than expected , and that cosmic ray extragalactic astronomy is only possible only for very close sources or very high energy .    in any case , the power emitted in cosmic ray from cena is straightforward to compute .",
    "in fact the source is so close to us that the cosmological and energy loss corrections are small for @xmath374  ev . the luminosity in the energy decade above @xmath130 can be estimated as : @xmath375 ( where @xmath376 is the number of events arriving from cen  a ) .",
    "this result is in reasonable agreement ( at least in order of magnitude ) with the estimates ( [ eq : l0auger ] ) and ( [ eq : lum_estimate ] ) , especially allowing for a broad luminosity distribution .",
    "it is interesting to make a prediction on how the number of detected clusters will scale with additional exposure .",
    "an illustration of this problem is in  fig .",
    "[ fig : auger2 ] that shows how the number of clusters with multiplicity @xmath377 grows with exposure for the auger detector .",
    "if the median luminosity of the sources is small the number of clusters grows @xmath378 , faster than the linear growth of the inclusive rate .",
    "eventually this growth must slow down and finally stop when the exposure is sufficient to observe as clusters of events sources close to the energy loss horizon .",
    "the asymptotic number of detectable sources is clearly sensitive to the form of the luminosity function , and to the density of weak sources with luminosity much smaller than the median luminosity @xmath150 .",
    "the existence of the extragalactic cosmic rays is the best reason to predict also a measurable flux of extragalactic neutrinos .",
    "in fact , the cr sources must unavoidably also generate neutrinos , because a fraction of the relativistic hadrons they produce will interact with matter or radiation fields inside or near the source , producing weakly decaying particles ( pions and kaons ) that generate neutrinos . the power density and luminosity function of the neutrino extragalactic sources are therefore related to the analogous quantities for cosmic ray emission . the relation between the cr and the @xmath379 emissions",
    "is very uncertain and depends on the structure of the sources .",
    "the motivation for the simultaneous measurement of both cosmic rays and neutrinos is precisely the understanding of the nature and structure of their common sources .    in the following we want to discuss the observations of neutrinos using the detection of @xmath379induced muons in `` km@xmath380 '' type neutrino telescopes like icecube at the south pole and km3net in the mediterranean sea . we will use a simplified model for the effective area of a neutrino detector that is discussed in appendix  [ sec : app_nu ]",
    ". it can be useful to think about the signal of neutrino induced muons as a measurement of the integral neutrino flux above the threshold @xmath381  tev using an effective area that is the geometric area of the detector times an energy averaged neutrino to muon conversion efficiency of order @xmath382 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath383 depends on the shape of the neutrino spectrum , the energy threshold for muon detection and the average zenith angle of the source considered .",
    "taking into account the small conversion efficiency the effective area of a km@xmath380 neutrino detector is of order of only few square meters , many orders of magnitude smaller that the effective area of a telescope like auger ( with a surface of approximately 3000  km@xmath310 ) .",
    "it is however interesting to note that , in some sense , the sensitivities of detectors like auger and icecube are comparable .",
    "this can be illustrated with the following example , if we have one source that emits protons and neutrinos with spectra that are approximately equal in both shape and absolute normalization , and the spectra can be reasonably well approximated as power law of slope @xmath327 , the the source ( if in the field of view of the detectors ) will leave event rates in ultra high energy showers , and in neutrino induced muons are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this can be easily understood qualitatively observing that energy threshold shower detection is of order @xmath384  ev , while the neutrino telescopes is sensitive to neutrinos with @xmath385  ev . the integral fluxes above these energy thresholds are ( for a spectrum of slope @xmath327 ) in a ratio @xmath386 , but also the effective areas differ by approximately the same factor , resulting in approximately the same event rates .",
    "this discussion is made more quantitative in figure  [ fig : lumz ] that show the curves in the plane @xmath387 ( distance , luminosity ) that corresponds to one event / year in auger ( for a source places at @xmath388 ) and in a km@xmath380 telescope of the icecube type .",
    "the luminosity must be understood as the luminosity per energy decade , and the source spectrum is a power law with slope @xmath142 .",
    "for very close sources , the lines that correspond to a constant event rate have the simple form @xmath389 . for these close sources ,",
    "the neutrino event rate is a factor approximately  5 ( 3 ) times smaller than the shower rate with a threshold @xmath390  ev ( @xmath391  ev ) .",
    "on the other hand the proton source become effectively invisible when they are behind an energy loss horizon that is a rapidly varying function of energy , while the entire universe is visible with neutrinos .",
    "it is interesting to perform also for extragalactic neutrinos the same study done for protons , and discuss what fraction of the inclusive signal can be resolved as the contribution of individual sources .    with respect to the study of uhecr",
    "there are a several obvious differences .",
    "the first one is that neutrinos travel in straight lines and therefore the problem of the impact of extragalactic magnetic field is entirely absent .",
    "the angular size of a cluster of @xmath379induced muons is controled by the muon  neutrino angle , that is calculable ( the angular dimension of the signal has a weak but non entirely negligible dependence on the shaope of the neutrino spectrum ) .",
    "a second difference is the presence of the atmospheric neutrino background that constitute an important complication .",
    "the total number of neutrino events from astrophysical sources can only be obtained with a non trivial analysis that requires the estimate and subtraction of the background .",
    "an additional problem is that much ( but not all ) of the information about the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum is lost .",
    "the detected muon energy can only be measured with poor resolution , and this energy is only poorly correlated with the parent neutrino energy .",
    "finally , neutrinos can travel without interacting across a hubble distance , and it is therefore expected that the fraction of the inclusive signal that can be resolved and associated to individual sources , is going to be much smaller than for uhecr that can reach us only from a much smaller volume determined by the energy loss length .    at present there is only an upper limits on the possible flux of extragalactic neutrinos .",
    "the most stringent one has been obtained by the amanda detector at the south pole @xcite , and is expressed in reference to an isotropic neutrino spectrum of form @xmath392 .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the constant @xmath393 ( relevant for the combination @xmath394 ) is @xmath395 the quantity @xmath393 can be expressed in terms of the power density of the neutrino sources at the present epoch using : @xmath396 where the factor of 3 takes into account the expected contribution of all other neutrino flavors ( see @xcite for a critical discussion ) .",
    "the upper limit on the power density of the extragalactic neutrino sources is : @xmath397 ( the estimate @xmath210 includes an important redshift dependence of the source power density ) .",
    "it can be useful to translate this upper limit on the extragalactic neutrino flux as a maximum number of events generated from extragalactic neutrinos .",
    "the total number of extragalactic neutrino events can be calculated using equations ( [ eq : nev ] ) , and depends on the power density of the neutrino events : @xmath398    a calculation of the number of sources and of the number of multiplets as a function of the median luminosity @xmath150 is shown in fig .",

    "one can estimate @xmath403 , that is 20% lower . for",
    "a neutrino detector placed at the equator one should have @xmath404 .",
    "the dependence of the expected number of resolve sources on the detector latitude is an elementary geometric effect associated with the reduced field of view of a detector close to the poles .",

    "the number of multiplets is expected to grow approximately @xmath378 even for exposures of hundreds of square kilometer year .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that this functional form continues until the detector sensitivity is sufficient to see as muon multiplets sources located at approximately a hubble distance , and this does require very large exposures , unless the luminosity of the source is extraordinarily large .",
    "the key problems about the nature and properties of the extragalactic cosmic rays sources remain open , even if some of the answers seems to be tantalizingly close .",
    "one of the most urgent problems is the determination of the region of source distance and particle energy where astronomy with charged cosmic rays is possible .",
    "the results of auger on the correlation of the arrival direction of the highest energy cr with the positions of close agn suggest that astronomy with cr is possible with a threshold of @xmath412  ev , and a volume of radius @xmath413  mpc .",
    "these are very encouraging results , but they need to be confirmed with more statistics",
    ". if a significant part of the anisotropy effect observed by auger is due to the contribution of a single source at only 3.5  pc the observation of more distant sources could be significanly more problematic .",
    "assuming that the linear propagation of the highest energy cosmic rays is a reasonable approximation and that most of the particles are protons , the clustering ( and lack of clustering ) of the highest energy events determinee to within a factor of 300 or so the typical luminosity of a extragalactic cr sources ( in the energy decade above @xmath414  ev ) as @xmath415 $ ]  erg / s .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the estimated luminosity of cen  a that is of order few times @xmath416  erg / s . in the same energy region",
    "the power density of the ensemble of the cr sources if of order of @xmath417  erg/(s  mpc@xmath380 ) .    the neutrino observations , that at present limit the power density of the neutrino sources to a maximum value of order @xmath418  erg/(s  mpc@xmath380 ) offer already a quite significant constraint , since the neutrino limit refer to the power density per energy decade in at much lower energy , and therefore suggest that the spectrum of the cr emission can not extend to low energy with a too steep spectrum .",
    "the inclusive extragalactic neutrino flux is mostly generated by distant , very faint sources , and therefore only a small fraction ( probably less than @xmath419 ) can be resolved in the contribution of individual sources by detectors of the icecube type . if an extragalactic neutrino component is not too far from the existing upper limits , the sensitivity of the km@xmath380 neutrino telescopes could be insufficient to detect more than a handful of extragalactic sources .",
