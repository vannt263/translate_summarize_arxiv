    "the ras is defined as the difference between the normalized reflectivities measured at normal incidence , for two orthogonal polarizations of light . throughout this paper ,",
    "the surface is perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis , and the @xmath4 direction is perpendicular to the si - si dimers of the reconstructed si(100 ) surface .",
    "ras is hence measured , as a function of the photon energy , as @xmath5 , where r is the ( isotropic ) fresnel reflectivity .",
    "describing the surface within a repeated slab geometry , one can express @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) for normally incident light as @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the polarization direction , @xmath10 are the diagonal terms of the half - slab polarizability tensor , and @xmath11 is the complex bulk dielectric function .",
    "if the slab has a center of inversion or a mirror plane parallel to the surface ( @xmath12 symmetry , in our case ) , the imaginary part of @xmath10 can be written , in the single ",
    "quasiparticle approximation , as :    @xmath13=\\frac{4\\pi^{2}e^{2}}{{\\omega}^{2}a}\\sum_{\\vec{k}}\\sum_{v , c}{|v_{v\\vec{k } , c\\vec{k}}^{i}|}^{2 } \\delta(e_{c\\vec{k}}-e_{v\\vec{k}}-{\\hbar}{\\omega}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 are the matrix element of the velocity operator between occupied ( @xmath15 ) and empty ( @xmath16 ) slab eigenstates at the point @xmath17 in the surface brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "`` a '' is the slab surface area , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are conduction and valence energy eigenvalues , taken as representative of quasiparticle energies .",
    "neglecting the pseudopotential nonlocality @xcite , the velocity operator can be replaced by the momentum operator divided by the electronic mass , whose matrix elements @xmath20 are easy to evaluate in the plane - wave basis .",
    "if the slab has two identical surfaces , @xmath21 is simply obtained by dividing by two the polarizability of the full slab .",
    "there are many cases , however , where one needs to single out the contributions coming from an individual half of the slab , or from regions situated at different depths below the surface .",
    "this problem has been recently discussed by some of us @xcite and by others @xcite , and can be solved by introducing a real - space cutoff in the definition of the matrix elements .",
    "this method proved itself very useful for separating surface contributions from bulk and subsurface ones in optical spectra , and has already been applied to the case of the clean si(100 ) reconstructed surface @xcite . in the real - space cutoff scheme , modified matrix elements",
    "@xmath22 are needed , which incorporate a function @xmath23 switching from 1 inside the selected region to zero outside the selected region .",
    "@xmath22 are defined as :    @xmath24    the imaginary part of the polarizability is hence given by @xcite :    @xmath25=\\frac{2\\pi{e^{2}}}{m^{2}{\\omega}^{2}a}{\\sum}_{\\vec{k}}{\\sum}_{v , c}[p_{v\\vec{k},c\\vec{k}}^{i } ] ^{*}{\\tilde{p}}_{v\\vec{k},c\\vec{k}}^{i}{\\delta}(e_{c\\vec{k}}-e_{v\\vec{k}}-{\\hbar}\\omega ) , \\label{eq : alpha_cutoff}\\ ] ]    where both @xmath26 and @xmath20 ( the standard momentum matrix element , calculated without the cut - off function ) appear .",
    "working in the reciprocal space , the evaluation of @xmath26 requires a double sum over the reciprocal lattice vectors \\{@xmath27 } , in contrast to the single sum which yields @xmath28 @xcite ,. vectors included in the sum .",
    "we have obtained that 4000 @xmath27-vectors are enough for achieving convergence , approximatively 1/5 of the initial basis size . ]",
    "electronic wavefunctions and eigenvalues are obtained within the local density approximation ( lda ) to density - functional theory @xcite using a plane - waves basis set .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy is evaluated according to the ceperley and alder results @xcite as parametrized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "the ion - electron interaction is represented by norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "special attention was devoted to the generation of a good norm - conserving pseudopotential for oxygen , in order to achieve an high transferability without requiring too many plane waves for convergence . to this aim",
    ", we adopted the hamann scheme @xcite , and optimized the core radii in order to find the best compromise between the basis set convergence and transferability .",
    "the latter was checked not only against logarithmic derivatives , but also performing explicit atomic calculations in several excited configurations .",
    "more extensive pseudopotential tests have been performed on three small molecules ( sio , h@xmath29sio , si@xmath29o ) and on the @xmath30-quartz crystalline phase of silica , in order to check the convergence of their structural and electronic properties with respect to the basis set ( number of plane waves ) . as a result , the theoretical length of the si - o bond is found to converge ( within 1% ) already at a 30 ry cutoff for all three molecules .",
    "the theoretical values of 1.51  ( sio ) and 1.52  ( h@xmath29sio ) compare well with the experimental ones ( 1.51  @xcite and 1.515  @xcite respectively ) .",
    "concerning @xmath30-quartz , the calculated lattice constant at 30 ry is 4.87  , to be compared with the experimental value of 4.916  @xcite .",
    "the si(100 ) surface was simulated by a repeated slab of twelve silicon layers and four layers of vacuum .",
    "the surface unit cell has been choosen as a ( 2x2 ) one , for computational convenience , in order to be able to consider both the ( 2x1 ) and p(2x2 ) reconstructions within the same cell .",
    "first , the clean surface structure has been determined by a full structural optimization ( keeping only the central four si layers as fixed ) , using the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno minimization algorithm as implemented in the abinit code @xcite until the residual forces acting on each atom are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the resulting structure was p(2x2 ) reconstructed in agreement with previous results @xcite , with a dimer buckling of 0.79  .",
    "the ground state of the c(4x2 ) reconstruction , requiring a different surface unit cell , has also been considered for comparison .    from the structural point of view",
    ", the difference between c(4x2 ) and p(2x2 ) is very tiny : in both cases one has rows of buckled si dimers , and the buckling ( at difference with the ( 2x1 ) reconstruction ) _ alternates _ along those rows .",
    "the only difference between c(4x2 ) and p(2x2 ) consists in the buckling alternance _ in the direction perpendicular to the rows_.    considering that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dimer - dimer interaction is much larger along the rows than between adjacent rows very small energetic and spectral differences between c(4x2 ) and p(2x2 ) are to be expected .",
    "in fact , from the theoretical point of view , the stabilities of the p(2x2 ) and c(4x2 ) reconstructions are essentially identical @xcite . recently , _",
    "ab initio _ calculations have shown that it is possible to induce the formation of p(2x2 ) domains by electric fields or charge injection @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the coexistence of p(2x2 ) and c(4x2 ) domains at very low temperature is supported by recent low - temperature non contact atomic force microscopy data , which show that almost 12 % of the ordered si(100 ) surface is p(2x2 ) reconstructed @xcite .",
    "hence , the p(2x2 ) cell can be taken as a realistic model of the clean si(100 ) surface .",
    "two o atoms were then adsorbed on each of the two slab surfaces ( in order to preserve the inversion symmetry ) , which corresponds to a 0.5 ml oxidation . based on previous _ ab initio _ calculations of oxygen adsorption on the si(100 ) surface @xcite , we have chosen the most stable configuration that can be reached in a barrierless or almost barrierless dissociation of the molecule : one o atom is in bridge position on a surface si - si dimer , and the second o atom also in bridge position on a nearest si - si backbond .",
    "many previous theoretical results @xcite have shown that : i ) the preferred adsorption site of an isolated o atom is a si - si backbond ; ii ) the backbond of the `` down atom '' of the dimer is strongly preferred over the `` up atom '' backbond ( at the point that if adsorption occurs on the backbond of the `` up atom '' , this is sufficient to induce locally the reversing of the buckling ) ; iii ) when an o@xmath0 molecule adsorbs , it dissociates leaving @xcite one oxygen atom into the si - si surface dimer bond , and the remaining atom into the `` down atom '' backbond .",
    "we consider hence the configuration denoted by ( h ) in ref .",
    "the same structure is also considered ( denoted by `` a '' ) in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "this structure has been selected among the several other total energy minima for two oxygen atoms on si(100 ) , because it can be immediately reached after o@xmath0 dissociation ( at difference with structures `` d '' and `` e '' of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and can efficiently model the effects of `` breaking '' one of the surface si - si dimers .",
    "after oxygen adsorption on the dimer and backbond bridge sites ( fig . [",
    "fig : topfullrelaxed ] ) , and a new full structural relaxation , one of the surface si - si dimers is broken ( see tab . [",
    "tab : structural ] : the dimer length after oxidation becomes 3.06  ) .",
    "concerning the length of the oxidized si backbond , we obtain 2.53  after o adsorption , to be compared with the 2.60  reported in ref .",
    "the structural relaxation remains limited to the immediate neighbouring of the o atom , since subsurface layers ( 2nd and 3rd silicon layer ) are not affected appreciably .",
    "the buckling of the non - oxidized dimer , which is expected to be stabilized by o adsorption @xcite , increases only very slightly , passing from 0.79 to 0.81  .    to compute optical spectra , the ground state calculation",
    "must be followed by a calculation of bandstructure energies and wavefunctions over a dense mesh in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone , for both occupied and empty states . to this aim , we calculated kohn ",
    "sham eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the arnoldi algorithm @xcite , for all states up to 12 ev above the highest occupied state ( i.e. , about 250 empty states above the 108 filled ones ) in each @xmath17point .    fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructures ] shows the computed bandstructure , near the fermi level , for both the clean and the oxidized surfaces , along the @xmath31 path in the irreducible wedge of the surface brillouin zone . for the clean surface ,",
    "results are in excellent agreement with previous _ ab initio _ dft - lda calculations @xcite on the si(100)p(2x2 ) surface .",
    "we note the strong dispersion along @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the surface bands arising from the dangling bonds which form @xmath34 ( bonding ) and @xmath35 ( antibonding ) states . this large dispersion is associated with a non - negligible interaction between adjacent silicon dimers in the direction perpendicular to the dimer axis @xcite ( this is the direction along which the p(2x2 ) and c(4x2 ) surfaces are identical ) .    after oxidation , the direct gap at @xmath36 increases from 0.2 to 0.4 ev . however , surface states are still localized on dbs , as can be seen from a plot ( not shown ) of their charge densities .",
    "even the oxidized dimers show distinct filled and empty db - like surface states .",
    "the band dispersion in the direction perpendicular to dimers becomes smaller , which can be explained by a weakening of the interaction between adjacent dimers ( in our case , an oxidized and a non oxidized one ) , as a consequence of oxidation .",
    "oxidation also lifts the initial degeneracy of surface bands at the @xmath37 corner of the surface brillouin zone .",
    "optical spectra have been computed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_cutoff ] ) , using increasingly large sets of @xmath17points ( up to 162 ) . the following monkhorst ",
    "pack @xcite , @xmath17point meshes were considered in the upper half of the ( 2x2 ) surface brillouin zone : 5x5 , 7x7 , 9x9 , 11x11 and 18x9 . in the energy window 0 - 3.5",
    "ev , the 9x9 mesh is sufficient to achieve convergence , superimposing a small gaussian broadening ( 75 mev ) to the calculated spectrum .",
    "similarly , in the range between 6 and 12 ev , the 11x11 mesh is sufficient , with the same small broadening .",
    "the intermediate energy window , between 3.5 and 6 ev , is the most slowly convergent one . indeed , a fully converged ras in this region can only be obtained by increasing the broadening up to 250 mev , with the largest @xmath17point sets used ( 11x11 and 18x9 ) .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] . in the right panel , the lowest - exposure experimental data from reference @xcite are also reported for comparison .    comparing the ras of the oxidized and clean surfaces up to 1.8 ev two differences come into evidence : i ) after oxygen adsorption , there is a redshift by 0.2 ev of the main transition peak of the clean surface , and ii ) a new structure appears between 1.4 and 1.75 ev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ras.clean.oxidized ] ) .",
    "however , the overall ras lineshape does not undergo qualitative changes . in the inset we also plot the ras of the clean si(100)c(4x2 ) reconstruction , which below 1.6 ev is practically identical to that of p(2x2).-points sampling . ]    in order to clarify the origin and nature of oxygen - induced modifications , we have performed a layer - by - layer analysis of the ras according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cutoff ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_cutoff ] ) , applying the real - space cutoff method described in ref . @xcite .",
    "this allows one to quantify the contribution to the ras originated in the different surface and subsurface regions .",
    "we divided our slab in five slices : the first four ( starting from the middle of the slab ) containing only silicon atoms , and the last one including surface dimers , oxygen atoms , and the subsurface si atoms bonded to the surface dimers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] . for the last slice ,",
    "the cutoff region extends up to a distance of about 1  above the surface .",
    "the resulting spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff_spectra ] : as expected , the reflectance anisotropy signal coming from slice 1 and slice 2 is almost zero up to 3.0 ev ( i.e. , in the whole region below the bulk si direct gap ) , coherently with the fact that they are bulk representative .",
    "the presence of the surface starts to be felt in the 3rd slice , where the two main negative ras peaks , characteristic of the clean surface , start to appear ( at about 1 and 3 ev , respectively ) .",
    "slice 4 gives a contribution very similar to slice 3 , with a larger strength of the 1.0 ev peak .",
    "the latter peak is also strongly present in the topmost slice contribution , together with the 3 ev one .",
    "an analysis of the localization of electronic states involved in strongest dipole allowed transitions for the 1.0 ev peak show almost no contributions from electronic states involving o atoms .",
    "indeed , the states which originate this peak are valence states corresponding mainly to dangling bonds localized on the upper si atom of the oxidized dimer , and conduction states corresponding mainly to @xmath38-like orbitals of the lower silicon atom of the non - oxidized dimer . however , besides the two main peaks at 1 and 3 ev , the topmost slice also contributes with a new structure , located at about 1.5 ev , which does not appear in slice 3 and slice 4 contributions .",
    "empty states involved in the transitions responsible for this feature are in fact found to be strongly localized on the lower si atom of the si - o - si bridge ( broken dimer ) , and on the o atoms themselves ( @xmath39-like orbitals ) , so this feature represents a sort of oxygen signature .    in order to obtain deeper insight on the electronic states involved in the main spectral structures , we have singled out , from the whole summation appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_cutoff ] ) , the contributions which give the largest oscillator strength and the larger anisotropy , restricted to well - defined energy windows centered on the main low - energy peaks of the imaginary part of the slab polarizability tensor . to this aim",
    ", we have selected three energy windows , labeled with a , b and c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : select.trans1 ] ) . based on the plot of the imaginary part of the half - slab polarizability for light polarization perpendicular ( @xmath4 ) and parallel ( @xmath40 ) to the silicon dimers . in each region , the contribution coming from each @xmath17point and band pairs ( @xmath41 ) have been sorted on the basis of two criteria : the value of the squared modulus @xmath42 , and the value of the anisotropy calculated as @xmath43 . as a result , only the uppermost 4 valence states ( labeled : 105108 ) and the lowest 4 conduction states ( labeled : 109112 ) are found to be the main responsibles for the strongest optical transitions , with 107 @xmath44 109 and 108 @xmath44 109 contributing to peak a ( [ 0.8,0.9 ] ev ) , and 107 + 108 @xmath44 110 + 111 contributing to peak b ( [ 1.0,1.15 ] ev ) , while peak c ( [ 1.40,1.75 ] ev ) is due to the transitions 106 @xmath44 111 and 105 @xmath44 112 , as illustrated in fig . [ fig : select.trans1 ] .",
    "this result is confirmed by the comparison of the full ras with a spectrum computed including only this set of 4 valence and 4 conduction states ( i.e. , based on just 16 out of 27216 @xmath15-@xmath16 transitions ) : in the energy window between 0 and 1.8 ev all main features of the ras are reproduced , apart for small difference in intensities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : select.trans2 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the very first stage of oxidation of si(100)p(2x2 ) , at a coverage of 0.5 ml , showing that oxidation of one of the two si ",
    "si dimers of the p(2x2 ) unit cell does not change dramatically the ras shape , despite the breaking of the dimer and the large flattening of the lowest conduction band , which reflects the weakening of the dimer  dimer interaction along the direction perpendicular to the dimer axis . in particular , the negative peak at 3.7 ev does not disappear ( see footnote 42 ) .",
    "however , oxidation of one dimer gives rise to distinguishable effects on the ras in the lowest energy region ( 0 to 1.8 ev ) , which can be understood in terms of transitions between the four highest valence bands and the four lowest conduction bands of the slab , localized essentially on dangling bonds of silicon atoms , belonging to both types of dimers ( oxidized and non - oxidized ) .",
    "these effects are essentially summarized by a redshift of about 0.2 ev of the first ras negative peak , disappearance of the small structures below 1.0 ev , typical of the clean surface , and appearance of a new structure at 1.5 ev , which can be seen as an `` oxygen signature '' .",
    "the latter can be clearly separated from extra artificial oscillations induced by the discreteness of the brillouin zone sampling , when a sufficiently large number of @xmath17points is used .",
    "the shift of the first negative peak is strongly linked to the structural surface relaxation which follows oxygen adsorption , and becomes larger if the relaxation is not complete .",
    "a layer - by - layer analysis of the ras shows that the 1.5 ev structure is extremely surface  localized ( topmost 2.64  ) , while the origin of the two main negative peaks also extends somehow to the subsurface region ( topmost 5.42  ) .",
    "we predict that the appearance of this feature should be detectable in reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy experiments on si(100 ) in the sub - monolayer range .",
    "our theoretical predictions could be experimentally assessed by reducing the oxygen exposure to a value of the order of 1 - 10 langmuir , to be compared with the @xmath45 10@xmath2 langmuir of presently available exprimental data .",

    "<S> the effects of oxygen adsorption on the reflectance anisotropy spectrum ( ras ) of reconstructed si(100):o surfaces at sub - monolayer coverage ( first stages of oxidation ) have been studied by an _ ab initio _ dft - lda scheme within a plane - wave , norm - conserving pseudopotential approach . </S>",
    "<S> dangling bonds and the main features of the characteristic ras of the clean si(100 ) surface are mostly preserved after oxidation of 50% of the surface dimers , with some visible changes : a small red shift of the first peak , and the appearance of a distinct spectral structure at about 1.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic transitions involved in the latter have been analyzed through state  by  state and layer  by  layer decompositions of the ras . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that new interplay between present theoretical results and reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy experiments could lead to further clarification of structural and kinetic details of the si(100 ) oxidation process in the sub - monolayer range .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10000    the developments in the capability to monitor and to control oxidation of the silicon ( 100 ) surface at an atomic - scale resolution are a very important issue in semiconductor device technology . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , high quality gate insulators thinner than 2 nm are today required , due to the continuous downscaling of the metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) devices ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in the last two decades </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption of oxygen on silicon surfaces has been extensively studied , from both experimental and theoretical points of view . in particular , the effects induced by oxidation on the optical properties of the silicon surfaces are being thoroughly studied since the mid eighties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known since then that o@xmath0 adsorption is dissociative , and that preferred final adsorption sites for o atoms are si - si bond - bridge positions . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been shown that in the case of si(100 ) the most favorable adsorption sites for o are the dimer - bridge , and the backbond site of the down atom of the surface dimer @xcite . the latter site is slightly favored over the former when insertion of a single o atom is considered . </S>",
    "<S> when two oxygen atoms originated by the dissociation of an o@xmath0 molecule are present , then the most favorable configuration which can be reached in a barrierless or almost barrierless reaction ( i.e. with oxygen present only on surface sites ) is that with one oxygen inserted into the down atom backbond , and the other inserted into the dimer bond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is in fact known that , during the first stages of oxidation , o@xmath0 adsorption and o migration to the dimer backbonds proceed as barrierless ( or almost barrierless ) reactions , as demonstrated by both experimental @xcite and theoretical works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> configurations with oxygen moving deeper into the second and/or third layer have been theoretically predicted @xcite , but require the overcoming of a non - negligible energy barrier and are not considered here . </S>",
    "<S> further si(100 ) oxidation has been shown to proceed in a layer - by - layer manner , giving rise to an oscillatory effect in the surface anisotropy , which has been detected by `` in situ '' reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of the growth of a sio@xmath0 layer over the si(100 ) surface , and the related problem of the properties of the si - sio@xmath0 interface , have received most of the attention , and several calculations of structural and electronic properties of the interface are available @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , what happens in the very first stages of oxidation ( below 1 ml coverage ) is still poorly known : oxidation of the second layer starts soon @xcite , and recent experimental works @xcite do not focus on the formation of the first layer , which is completed in a very short time ( less than 1 second ) at the experimentally used o@xmath0 partial pressures . </S>",
    "<S> partial pressure as large as 10@xmath1 pa , lead an exposure at about 10@xmath2 langmuir in only a few seconds . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the well - known surface originating negative ras peaks at low energy disappear almost immediately ( see figures 5 and 6 in reference @xcite ) . ] since reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy is a very sensitive technique , which in the case of the clean si(100 ) surface is able to detect small structural details @xcite , and in contrast with other characterization techniques based on electrons can be used  in situ  to monitor the process under manufacturing conditions , we suggest , with the present work , a possible application of reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy to shed light on the structural and kinetic details of the si(100 ) oxidation process in the sub - monolayer range .    our aim is to study in a detailed and quantitative way the changes on the ras features induced by very low concentrations of chemisorbed oxygen on the si(100 ) surface . to this scope </S>",
    "<S> , a layer - resolved analysis of the most relevant low - energy spectral features will be presented . </S>"
