    "quantum computation is performed by physical processes obeying quantum mechanics .",
    "it became one of the most exciting field in physics and information theory after shor  @xcite discovered an algorithm to factorize integers which is exponentially faster than any known classical ones .",
    "in quantum computation theory ( qct ) , as in classical computation theory , the computation time is usually defined by the number of elementary steps or gates necessary to perform a computation , i.e. , to realize a desired unitary operator .",
    "minimum such number is called the gate complexity",
    ". we shall call this conventional qct as gate - optimal qct ( _ g_-qct ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate time - optimal quantum computation theory ( _ t_-qct ) where the computation time is defined by _ physical time_. there are two motivations for _ t_-qct .",
    "the first is to develop ( an abstract ) _ t_-qct itself which is a physical - time - based alternative to _ g_-qct . since",
    "a quantum computation is a physical process , it is physically more natural to measure the time by the physical one . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the computation time in _ g_-qct can be seen as _ information - theoretic time _ which is a more abstract or coarse - grained notion of time than the physical one .",
    "time optimality is attracting growing attention in quantum optimal control theory ( oct ) mainly in the context of physical applications such as control of an atom by an electromagnetic field and nmr quantum computation ( @xcite and references therein ) .    the second motivation , which we stress in the present work and state in detail in sec .",
    "[ mot ] , is that _ t_-qct may be a useful tool to analyze _ g_-qct . finding the gate - optimal algorithm is a discrete and combinatorial problem , which makes construction of a general theory difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "time - optimal algorithms are smooth curves in a certain space which obeys a differential equation  @xcite , typically that for a sub - riemannian geodesic  @xcite on a manifold .",
    "this may allow a general theory and approximation methods .",
    "moreover , roughly speaking , upper and lower bounds for gate complexity can be given in terms of optimal physical time  @xcite . thus _",
    "t_-qct is useful in the investigation of _ g_-qct .",
    "one may become able to calculate gate complexity by calculating time complexity .",
    "we ask to what extent holds the statement that the time complexity is polynomial in the number of qubits if and only if so is the gate complexity .",
    "we will therefore compare the time complexity and the gate complexity for some typical examples .",
    "we choose the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) as an example of the target unitary operator of which a fast algorithm in the sense of _ g_-qct ( i.e. whose gate complexity is polynomial in the number of qubits ) is known , while we choose a target unitary with no special symmetry because a generic series of target unitary operators is known not to have fast algorithms .    to achieve it ,",
    "we will make use of an efficient numerical method for oct , so - called krotov s method . we relate _",
    "t_-qct to fidelity - optimal qct ( _ f_-qct ) , and develop a krotov - like scheme for _ f_-qct by making use of the formal similarity of _ f_-qct and oct . in the context of oct , similar ideas of replacing time optimality to fidelity optimality have been used .",
    "we will see that both the qft and the asymmetric unitary operator satisfy the statement above .",
    "furthermore , we will find some characteristic behaviour of the optimal hamiltonian , namely , time - reversal symmetry and constancy of one - qubit hamiltonian components .    in analyzing _",

    "in fact , the action  ( [ eq - action ] ) is invariant under a time - dependent phase change of @xmath7 which can be considered as a gauge transformation  @xcite .",
    "therefore the theory is defined on @xmath36 , and one can also think of it as a theory on @xmath37 ( by `` gauge fixing '' ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are  @xcite the schrdinger equation ( [ eq - schu ] ) for @xmath7 , the normalization constraint ( [ eq - normalization ] ) , the schrdinger equation for @xmath34 , @xmath38 and the equation determining @xmath1 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",

    "the time @xmath48 is proportional to the arc length and depends solely on the eigenvalues @xmath49 of the relevant @xmath50 part of @xmath3 as @xmath51 where @xmath11 is a real and @xmath52 are integers .",
    "for example , the time is given by @xmath53 for the controlled not gate @xmath54 and swap gate @xmath55 whose eigenvalues are @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for the hardest two - qubit operation whose eigenvalues are @xmath58 .",
    "these can be used for the unit of @xmath48 in comparing @xmath48 with @xmath59 .",
    "there are some rigorous relations between the gate complexity and time complexity .",
    "very roughly speaking , one can give upper and lower bounds for gate complexity through the time complexity .    before introducing the relations , recall that in the simple cases , the time complexity @xmath60 can also be interpreted as the arc length @xmath61 of the sub - riemannian geodesic connecting @xmath10 and @xmath3 , up to overall multiplicative constant .",

    "note that we always have @xmath71 .",
    "let us explain the first inequality of ( [ eq - t - vs - g ] ) which is simple .",

    "thus the first inequality of ( [ eq - t - vs - g ] ) holds .",
    "the relation ( [ eq - t - vs - g ] ) is suggestive , and one might expect that @xmath75 by which we mean that @xmath76 and @xmath60 are bounded by some polynomial of each other and @xmath12 . however , it is argued that this can not be true in general  @xcite .",
    "then , one may want to ask to what extent ( [ eq - g - t ] ) is true in general , since ( [ eq - t - vs - g ] ) is derived by a completely general argument . in particular , we think that it is interesting to ask what are the classes of unitary operators @xmath66 which satisfy    1 .",

    "t_-qct itself is a good framework to analyze these questions theoretically .",
    "however , a drawback is that it is extremely hard in practice to derive exact solutions when @xmath12 is large .",
    "one way is to appeal to numerical calculations , but it is also difficult because one encounters a two - point boundary value problem in dimensions rapidly increasing with @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , time - optimal solutions were obtained up to seven qubits for the like of hamiltonians appearing in nmr quantum computers .",
