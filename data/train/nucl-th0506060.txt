    "strangeness opens a new dimension to nuclear physics . nuclear system with strangeness",
    "has many implications in astrophysics and cosmology and thus arouses much research interest .",
    "nuclear systems with strangeness can be categorized into two species : strange quark matter(or strangelet ) and strange hadronic matter(shm ) .",
    "quantum chromodynamics predicts that the strangenss - rich system could be strange quark matter or strangelet , consisting of _ u _ , _ d _ and _ s _ quarks . strangelet has been a hot research topic for both theoretical physics and experimental physics , but there is still no convincing experimental result to confirm its existence .",
    "the other possible existence of strangeness is shm , in which quarks are localized within nucleons and hyperons .",
    "the research of shm is attractive because of the complexity of its structure and ingredients , especially , the phase transition including the quark deconfinement phase transition and liquid - gas(l - g ) phase transition .",
    "this paper evolves from an attempt to study the l - g phase transition in shm at finite temperature . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we have studied the possibility of an l - g phase transition in shm utilizing the extended furnstahl - serot - tang(fst ) model . after investigating the mechanical and chemical stabilities of shm",
    ", we found a critical pressure on the binodal surface for @xmath2 and a limit pressure on the binodal surface for lower temperature . after examining the continuities of entropy and specific heat capacity",
    ", we found the l - g phase transition in shm is of second order . employing the chiral @xmath3 quark mean field model",
    ", the same conclusion has also been drawn in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , takahashi _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite observed the @xmath4 energy in a @xmath1 double hypernucleus .",
    "their observation deduced the @xmath0 energy to be @xmath5 , which is much smaller than the previous estimation @xmath6 from earlier experiments@xcite .",
    "this leads to a significant decrease of potential @xmath7 from about @xmath8 to @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the new data imply that the hyperon - hyperon interaction(y - y interaction ) can be weaker than known before@xcite .",
    "we employed two of many candidates of phenomenological shm models@xcite , namely , extended fst model@xcite and modified quark meson coupling(mqmc ) model@xcite , and the weak y - y interaction to reexamine the stability of shm .",
    "we came to a conclusion that , while the system with the strong y - y interaction and in a quite large strangeness fraction region is more deeply bound than the ordinary nuclear matter due to the opening of new degrees of freedom , the system with weak y - y interaction is rather loosely bound compared to the latter@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is not model - dependent on the extended fst model or mqmc model and true for both zero and finite temperature@xcite .    noting that the stability affects on the l - g phase transition directly",
    ", the stability of shm with weak y - y interaction is quite different from that with strong y - y interaction .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the influence of this difference on the l - g phase transition in shm . to employ the extended fst model and",
    "reexamine the l - g phase transition in shm with weak y - y interaction is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "we will show that there is still a second order l - g phase transition in shm with weak y - y interaction , but the binodal surface , limit pressure and the equation of state are very different from those of strong y - y interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the extended fst model is briefly introduced and the parameters for strong and weak y - y interactions are given . in sec .",
    "iii we reexamine the l - g phase transition in shm with weak y - y interaction .",
    "the last section is the summary of the main results .",
    "in refs.@xcite , we extended the original fst model to include not only nucleons and @xmath10 , @xmath11 mesons , but also @xmath12 , @xmath13 hyperons and strange mesons @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in ref.@xcite , we used this model to study the l - g phase transition in shm .",
    "the details of this model can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "hereafter , we only give brief formulae , which are necessary for discussing the l - g phase transition .    in mean - field approximation ,",

    "the shm is regarded as a two - component system , for instance , the nucleon component and the @xmath13 component .",
    "the strangeness fraction@xmath51 is introduced as @xmath52 which plays the similar role as that of the asymmetric parameter @xmath53 in the asymmetric nuclear matter .",

    "the details of the parameters are summarized in table 1 .",

    ".the parameters used in calculation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "in this section , we employ the extended fst model to investigate the l - g phase transition in the shm with weak y - y interaction .    using the formulae in sec.ii and the parameters of table 1 ,",
    "we calculate the pressure and study the equation of state first .",
    "the results for pressure vs. baryon density @xmath62 curves at @xmath63 are shown in fig.1 , with weak and strong y - y interactions , respectively .",
    "we can see that the equation of state for two cases are quite different in two aspects .",
    "firstly , with weak y - y interaction , when @xmath64 , the pressure increases with density monotonically and there are no mechanical unstable regions . while with strong y - y interaction , there are always mechanical unstable regions for each @xmath51 . secondly , with weak y - y interaction , the minimum of the pressure - density curve rises monotonically with @xmath51 , till @xmath64 , where there is no minimum . while with strong y - y interaction , the minimum drops with @xmath51 and reaches the lowest value on the curve of @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath66 , the pressure - density curves ascend with the increase of @xmath51 .",
    "these features are consistent with the behavior of energy - density curves and the stability of shm in ref.@xcite and @xcite .    to discuss the chemical instability of shm with weak y - y interaction , we show the chemical potential isobars for nucleons and @xmath13 against @xmath51 at temperature @xmath63 in fig.2 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "an inflection point could be spotted on the curve with the pressure @xmath69 .",
    "there are chemical unstable regions on curves with @xmath70 .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of strong y - y interaction but the inflection points are different for these two cases .",
    "the chemical , thermal and mechanical gibbs equilibrium conditions for two separate phases require @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where the superscripts @xmath74 , @xmath75 denote the liquid and gas phases , respectively .",
    "we follow the procedures used in refs.@xcite to solve out eqs.(14),(15),(16 ) .",
    "collecting up all the solutions and we get the phase boundary , i.e. , binodal surface .",
    "the binodal surface at @xmath63 are shown in fig.3 , where the dotted line refers to weak y - y interaction and the solid line to strong y - y interaction .",
    "we see from fig.3 that the differences between two binodal surfaces are very remarkable .",
    "though the limit pressures , above which the l - g phase transition can not take place , exist for both two cases , the values are very different .",
    "the limit pressure for weak y - y interaction @xmath76 is much higher than that of the strong y - y interaction as @xmath77 .",
    "the enclosed region of binodal surface with weak y - y interaction is much larger than that of the strong y - y interaction . a higher limit pressure and a larger region of phase separation imply that the system is likely to be less stable and the l - g phase transition can take place more easily .",
    "this result is of course very reasonable if we notice the conclusion given by refs@xcite that the shm with weak y - y interaction is less stable .    to determine the order of the l - g phase transition",
    ", we examine the entropy density and the specific heat capacity of shm with weak y - y interaction . by ehrenfest",
    "s definition , the first order phase transition is characterized by the discontinuities of the first order derivatives of the chemical potential , such as the discontinuities of entropy and volume , while the second order phase transition unfolds the discontinuous behavior for the second order derivatives of the chemical potential , such as the specific heat capacity .",
    "the entropy per baryon is @xmath78 where @xmath79 can be calculated from eq.(13 ) .",

    "we see from fig.4 that the entropy evolves continuously through the phase transition when @xmath86 .",
    "but when @xmath87 , our model reduces to the one - component symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the entropy becomes discontinuous .",
    "the l - g phase transition becomes the first order .",
    "this result is consistent with theoretical and experimental results about l - g phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the specific heat capacity vs. temperature curves for @xmath88 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the specific heat capacity curves are discontinuous for @xmath88 and @xmath84 .",
    "the continuity of entropy together with the discontinuity of specific heat capacity demonstrates that the l - g phase transition in shm with weak y - y interaction is still of second order , as expected .",
    "one of the important signals for l - g phase transition is the investigation of caloric curves@xcite .",
    "the caloric curve reflects the relationship between excited energy of hadronic matter and the temperature .",

    "is@xcite @xmath91    we present the caloric curves at pressure @xmath85 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 in fig.6 .",
    "there are slopes during the l - g phase transition for @xmath88 and @xmath84 , while for @xmath87 there is a platform .",
    "this platform - shaped caloric curve has been got in experiments of the l - g phase transition in normal symmetric nuclear matter@xcite . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the slopes mean that temperature does not remain constant during phase transition .",
    "this is the very feature of second order phase transition as was first pointed out by mller and serot@xcite .    to exhibit the behavior of caloric curves of shm with strong and weak y - y interactions clearly , we plot the temperature @xmath92 vs. @xmath90 curves at @xmath85 , @xmath93 for strong and weak y - y interactions in fig.7 .",
    "we find the temperature region of phase transition for weak y - y interaction is lower than that of strong y - y interaction and the slope for weak y - y interaction is more acclivitous .",
    "perhaps these distinctions can provide us a possibility to check the y - y interaction be strong or weak , and then the @xmath4 energy .",
    "we have used the new parameters about the weak y - y interaction derived from recent experiment data to reexamine the l - g phase transition in shm .",
    "we have employed the extended fst model with nucleons and @xmath12 , @xmath13 hyperons and simplified the shm into a two - component system to discuss its l - g phase transition .",
    "we come to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "no matter the y - y interaction is strong or weak , the l - g phase transition can take place in shm .",
    "the l - g phase transition is of second order for @xmath94 , the entropy is continuous and the heate capacity is discontinuous at the phase transition point .",
    "but for @xmath95 the l - g phase transition becomes the first order .",
    "the entropy is discontinuous .",
    "2 .   due to the difference between the stability of shm with strong and weak y - y interactions , the physical features of l - g phase transition , including the limit pressure , the regions enclosed by the binodal surface , the caloric curves , the slope of phase transition curves are very different for weak and strong y - y interactions . 3 .   after reexaming the features of shm",
