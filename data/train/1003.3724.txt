    "the firm evidence that neutrinos oscillate and possess small masses below the ev scale @xcite necessitates physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , which could manifest itself at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and/or in low energy experiments which search for lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , models of neutrino mass generation which can be probed at present and forthcoming experiments are of great phenomenological interest .",
    "neutrinos may obtain masses via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a neutral higgs boson in an isospin triplet representation @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple implementation of this mechanism of neutrino mass generation is the `` higgs triplet model '' ( htm ) in which the sm lagrangian is augmented solely by an @xmath0 triplet of scalar particles with hypercharge @xmath1  @xcite . in the htm , neutrinos acquire majorana masses given by the product of a triplet yukawa coupling ( @xmath2 ) and a triplet vev ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "consequently , there is a direct connection between @xmath2 and the neutrino mass matrix , which gives rise to phenomenological predictions for processes which depend on @xmath2 @xcite",
    ". a distinctive signal of the htm would be the observation of a doubly charged higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) , whose mass ( @xmath5 ) may be of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "such particles can be produced with sizeable rates at hadron colliders in the processes @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 is a singly charged higgs boson in the same triplet representation .",
    "direct searches for @xmath4 have been carried out at the fermilab tevatron , assuming the production channel @xmath6 and decays @xmath9 , and mass limits in the range @xmath10  gev have been obtained @xcite . the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , using the above production mechanisms , will offer improved sensitivity to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the singly charged higgs boson is also attractive at hadron colliders , with production via @xmath7 followed by the decay @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the neutral higgs bosons in the htm has received much less attention than that of the charged higgs bosons .",
    "there are two cp - even scalars ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) and one cp - odd scalar ( @xmath14 ) , which are composed of both isospin doublet and isospin triplet fields . in phenomenological studies of the htm",
    ", it is common to assume that the mass term for the scalar triplet ( @xmath15 ) is considerably larger than the mass of the isospin doublet scalar .",
    "this assumption guarantees that the mixing angle for the two cp - even scalars is small , being of the order @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the vev of the isospin doublet ) , where @xmath18 is required to maintain @xmath19 within experimental error .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is essentially composed of the isospin doublet field and plays the role of the sm higgs boson , while @xmath21 is essentially composed of the isospin triplet field , and is difficult to detect at hadron colliders .",
    "however , as pointed out explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mixing angle for the cp - even scalars can be maximal in the region of parameter space around degenerate masses for the cp - even scalars .",
    "we quantify in detail this parameter space of large mixing in the cp - even sector , and study its phenomenology .",
    "when the mixing angle is large , @xmath21 can be produced with observable rates in the standard search channels for the sm higgs boson .",
    "importantly , @xmath21 in the htm can be considerably lighter than @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 might be detected earlier than @xmath4 or @xmath22 , especially if the decay modes @xmath23 and @xmath24 dominate ( corresponding to @xmath25 gev ) , for which the lhc has sensitivity inferior to that for the leptonic channels @xmath9 and @xmath11 described above .    our work is organized as follows .",
    "the htm is briefly reviewed in section ii . in section iii , the scalar mass matrices , the mixing angle , and the higgs potential minimization and",

    "are discussed in section iv .",
    "our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in the htm , an @xmath26 complex @xmath27 triplet of scalar fields is added to the sm lagrangian .",
    "such a model can provide a majorana mass for the observed neutrinos ( without the introduction of additional neutrinos ) via the @xmath28 gauge - invariant yukawa interactions : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a complex and symmetric coupling matrix , @xmath31 is the dirac charge conjugation operator , @xmath32 is a pauli matrix , @xmath33 is a left - handed lepton doublet , and @xmath34 is a @xmath35 representation of the @xmath1 complex triplet fields : @xmath36 a non - zero triplet vev , @xmath37 , gives rise to the following mass matrix for neutrinos : @xmath38 this simple expression for tree - level majorana masses of the observed neutrinos is essentially the main motivation for studying the htm .",

    "therefore @xmath42 gev is necessary in order to comply with the measurement of @xmath43 .",
    "we will discuss this bound on @xmath40 in more detail later .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have provided much information on @xmath44 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and so the couplings @xmath2 are already constrained up to an arbitrary scalar factor ( the triplet vev , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the necessary non - zero @xmath40 arises from the minimization of the most general @xmath28 invariant higgs potential , which is written as follows @xcite : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the sm higgs doublet .",
    "variants of the above form for @xmath47 are given in refs .",

    "the mass term for the triplet scalars is given by @xmath53 and usually @xmath54 is taken .",
    "one can take values of @xmath53 which are arbitrarily large , but recently much attention has been given to the case of @xmath55 tev , since this would allow the triplet scalars ( especially the distinctive doubly charged scalar , @xmath4 ) to be within the discovery range of the lhc .",
    "the main production mechanisms for @xmath4 at hadron colliders are ( i ) @xmath6 @xcite , which depends on one unknown parameter , @xmath5 ; and ( ii ) @xmath56  @xcite , which depends on two unknown parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath57 . in the htm one",

    "production mechanisms which depend on the triplet vev ( @xmath60 and fusion via @xmath61 @xcite ) are not competitive with the above processes at the energies of the fermilab tevatron , but can be the dominant source of @xmath4 at the lhc if @xmath62 ( 1 gev ) and @xmath63 gev .",
    "the term @xmath64 leads to the triplet vev , as will be shown explicitly in the next section . in an early version of the htm @xcite ,",
    "the term @xmath64 is absent , but @xmath3 can still arise by taking the `` wrong sign '' choice for @xmath53 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this leads to spontaneous violation of the lepton number since majorana mass has come from a higgs potential which originally conserves the lepton number .",
    "the resulting higgs spectrum then contains a massless triplet scalar ( called majoron , @xmath66 , a goldstone boson ) and another light scalar ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is a dramatic prediction , and pair production via @xmath68 would give a large contribution to the invisible width of @xmath69 .",
    "this model is therefore testable , and it is now excluded because the invisible width for @xmath69 has been measured at the cern large electron positron collider ( lep ) , and its value is in good agreement with the sm prediction ( in which the invisible width comes from @xmath70 only ) .",
    "the inclusion of the term @xmath71 ) explicitly breaks lepton number when @xmath34 is assigned @xmath72 , and eliminates the majoron .",
    "alternatively , assigning @xmath73 would conserve lepton number in the higgs potential but break it in the yukawa interaction of eq .",
    "( [ trip_yuk ] ) .",
    "therefore , the lepton number is always broken irrespective of the assignment of @xmath73 or @xmath72 because of the presence of both eq .",

    "thus the above scalar potential together with the triplet yukawa interactions of eq .",
    "( [ trip_yuk ] ) lead to a model of neutrino mass generation which is viable phenomenologically .",
    "one can work in a simplified scalar potential ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) by neglecting the quartic couplings @xmath48 ( where @xmath74 ) involving the triplet field @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting scalar potential then depends on four parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) , but only three parameters are independent because the vev for the doublet field ( @xmath78 gev ) is fixed by the mass of @xmath79 .",
    "the three independent parameters are usually chosen as @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath48 generates additional trilinear and quartic couplings among the scalar mass eigenstates , which contribute to the term which mixes the cp - even scalars .",
    "the terms with @xmath82 and @xmath59 , which involve both triplet and doublet fields , are of particular interest because they can give sizeable contributions to the masses of the triplet fields ( when replacing the fields @xmath83 by @xmath84 ) . in this work",
