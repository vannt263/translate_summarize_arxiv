    "as @xmath1 decreases further , layering introduces discreteness in the interface profile and limits the decrease in radius . in the limit of one or two layers",
    ", the radius of the interface must always be effectively independent of height , implying zero vertical curvature and @xmath136 .",
    "since the surface tension contribution to the capillary force @xmath137 , there is a large increase in the magnitude of @xmath69 for fluids with equilibrium angles near @xmath138 ( fig . [ fortotplot](f ) ) or @xmath139 .",
    "detailed analysis of the local pressure tensor allowed us to isolate the trends in different contributions to the capillary force .",
    "when @xmath140 the pressure inside the liquid bridge becomes anisotropic .",
    "the in - plane component @xmath118 is consistent with the macroscopic solution for the laplace pressure @xmath64 for @xmath1 down to @xmath141-@xmath134 , even when layering prevents the meniscus from following the high predicted curvature . for these very thin films , direct interactions with",
    "the wall span the entire interface and replace the interfacial tension assumed in the young - laplace equation .",
    "in contrast , the normal component @xmath116 does not follow the macroscopic solution .",
    "it has an additional contribution that oscillates rapidly with @xmath1 and is large enough to change the sign of the pressure as well as the magnitude .",
    "the difference between normal and in - plane pressures , @xmath142 , represents a disjoining pressure from changes in free energy per unit area with surface separation .",
    "the oscillation period corresponds to the spacing between molecular layers that form near the walls and span the system for @xmath143 . for the short range interactions used here",
    ", @xmath126 is nearly independent of changes in wall interactions that change @xmath39 from @xmath144 to @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ disjoiningpressure ] ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath126 is predominantly from entropy associated with layer packing at a given wall spacing .",
    "the disjoining pressure is nearly independent of drop volume as long as the contact radius @xmath145 .",
    "it is useful to compare the results from the simulations presented here to those in our previous study of capillary adhesion in the sphere - on - flat geometry.@xcite this earlier paper also found that macroscopic theory described the interface shape but did not study menisci with heights less than @xmath146 because the curvature of the sphere led to large separations at the liquid / vapor interface .",
    "the most significant difference between the two studies is that the disjoining pressure for curved surfaces always had an additional repulsive component that increased with decreasing @xmath1 and sphere radius .",
    "this repulsion is not present for the flat surfaces used here .",
    "the increase in the magnitude of @xmath126 with increasing curvature confirms that it represents an additional entropic cost associated with changing the number of layers as curvature changes the local separation between the surfaces .",
    "experiments show that the range of the disjoining pressure can vary greatly with molecular structure and interactions.@xcite our results suggest that the capillary force will be consistent with macroscopic theory until the disjoining pressure is significant . if the disjoining pressure is added to the macroscopic theory , the result should remain accurate until @xmath1 approaches the molecular diameter or the thickness of the liquid / vapor interface .",
    "the two are the same in our system but the interface thickness may be larger , for example near a critical point",
    ". it will be interesting to test these ideas and to include the effect of surface roughness which may increase repulsion and lead to variations in the local contact angle .",
    "studies of plates with asymmetric wetting properties would also allow tests of macroscopic predictions , such as work that finds attraction whenever the sum of the contact angles on the solid plates is less than 180 degrees.@xcite",
