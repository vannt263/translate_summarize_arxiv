    "the interactions between grains in flowing granular material are roughly classified into two types ; the impulsive contact ( collision ) with the momentum exchange and the sustained contact with the transmission of forces @xcite .",
    "the flow in which the impulsive contact is dominant is called _ collisional flow _ , while the flow where the sustained contact dominates is called _",
    "frictional flow_. these two types of flow may be found in a simple geometry such as granular flow on a slope .",
    "the grains stay at rest when the inclination angle is too small .",
    "if the inclination exceeds a critical angle , the material starts flowing frictionally at first .",
    "the flow becomes collisional when the inclination is large enough .",
    "as for the collisional flow of granular material , its dynamics has some analogy with molecular fluid , and the kinetic theories based on inelastic binary collisions of particles hold to some extent @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the frictional flow is drastically different from the molecular fluid , and we have little understanding on it .",
    "many models have been proposed for dense granular flows : for example , some models take into account the effect of non - local force transmission which comes from the network of contacting grains @xcite . in the experiments , however , it is difficult to specify the nature of sustained contact in the dense flow .    for the simulations of granular dynamics ,",
    "the following two models have been commonly used , i.e. the inelastic hard sphere model and the soft sphere model .    in the inelastic hard sphere model ,",
    "the particles are rigid and the collisions are thus instantaneous , therefore its dynamics can be defined through a few parameters that characterize a binary collision because there are no many - body collisions @xcite . the model is simple and there are very efficient algorithms to simulate it @xcite , but it describes basically only the collisional flow @xcite because the sustained contact is not allowed .",
    "it is also known that the system often encounters what is called the inelastic collapse @xcite ; the infinite number of collisions take place among a small number of particles in a finite time , thus the dynamics can not be continued beyond that point without additional assumption .    on the other hand , in the soft sphere model ,",
    "that is sometimes called the discrete element method ( dem ) in the granular community @xcite , the particles overlap during collision and the dynamics is defined through the forces acting on the colliding particles .",
    "collision takes finite time , and not only binary collision but also many - body collision and sustained contact between particles are possible , therefore , both the collisional and the frictional flows may realize in the model .",
    "many researches have been done on granular flow down a slope using the dem in both the collisional regime and the frictional regime @xcite .    in actual simulations , however , the stiffness constants used in the soft sphere model are usually much smaller than the one appropriate for real material such as steel or glass ball @xcite because of numerical difficulty .",
    "therefore , some part of sustained contact in simulations may be decomposed into binary collisions if stiffer particles are used .",
    "it is also not clear that the frictional force in the sustained contact may be described by the same forces with the one suitable for the collisional events .",
    "it is , therefore , important to examine how the system behavior may change as the stiffness constant increases in the soft sphere model , or in other words , how the soft sphere model converges to the inelastic hard sphere model in the infinite stiffness limit . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of numerical simulations of the granular flow using the soft sphere model , and investigate the system behavior when we change the stiffness constant systematically with keeping the resulting restitution constant unchanged .    in sec .",

    "we find that the interactions between particles in the collisional flow smoothly converge to binary collisions of inelastic hard spheres , while those in frictional flow shows non - trivial behavior ; the behavior is also different from the `` inelastic collapse '' in the single particle system .",

    "it is well known that the inelastic hard sphere system can undergo the _",
    "inelastic collapse _ , i.e. , the phenomenon where infinite collisions take place within a finite period of time @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is the vertical bouncing motion of a ball under gravity , but it has been shown that the inelastic collapse also occurs in higher dimensional systems without gravity  @xcite .",
    "the inelastic collapse never occurs in the soft sphere model because of the finite length of the collision time .",
    "however , it is worth to discuss what will happen in the soft sphere model in the simple situation where the inelastic collapse occurs in the hard sphere model",
    ". first , let us consider the vertical bouncing motion of a soft ball under gravity .",
    "we assume the same force law between the ball and the floor as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fn ] ) and ( [ eq : ft ] ) , except that we replace @xmath56 by the mass of the ball .",
    "while the ball and the floor are in contact , the equation of motion for the overlap of the ball and the floor , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 with the acceleration of gravity @xmath59 , where the dots represent the time derivatives .",
    "one can show that , if the impact velocity @xmath60 is below a critical value @xmath61 , which is @xmath62 for large enough @xmath63 , the ball stays in contact with the floor ; for @xmath64 , the restitution coefficient @xmath65 can be considered as a constant .",
    "therefore , for a given initial impact velocity @xmath66 , the number of necessary collisions @xmath67 for the ball to stay in contact with the floor is roughly estimated by the condition @xmath68 , namely , @xmath69 . because @xmath70 for large @xmath63 , @xmath67 behaves as @xmath71 in the hard sphere limit .",
    "thus @xmath67 diverges logarithmically when @xmath54 , which corresponds to the inelastic collapse due to gravity .    in the case without gravity , the inelastic collapse results in the `` many - body collision '' in the soft sphere model .",
    "for example , we consider three soft spheres in one dimension and assume that the binary collision can be approximated by the collision law with a constant restitution coefficient .",
    "in the situation where a particle goes back and forth between the two particles approaching each other , the inelastic collapse may take place in the hard sphere model @xcite ; three balls lose relative velocity completely in the limit of infinite collisions . in the soft sphere model , however ,",
    "when the interval between two collisions becomes smaller than the duration of contact @xmath44 , three balls are in contact at the same time , namely , the three body collision occurs ; then they will fly apart .",
    "the number of collisions before the three body collision will also diverge logarithmically in the hard sphere limit because @xmath72 .    on the other hand",
    ", one should note that a many - body collision in the soft sphere model does not necessarily result in the inelastic collapse in the hard sphere limit .",
    "actually , in most of the cases , a many - body collision will be decomposed into a set of binary collisions in the hard sphere limit .",
    "in this section , we investigate the stiffness dependence of granular material on a slope in the following three situations : ( i ) a single particle rolling down a slope , ( ii ) the dilute collisional flow , and ( iii ) the dense frictional flow .",

    "we have confirmed that the results do not change for @xmath80 by calculating also with @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the case of the single particle .",

    "it is known that the particle shows the steady motion for a certain range of the inclination angle @xmath83 @xcite . in the simulations",

    "the average collision rate ( number of collisions per unit time ) between the slope and the particle , @xmath96 , shows logarithmic dependence on @xmath93 in the whole region ( fig .",
    "[ stiff1 ] ( b ) ) . from fig .",
    "[ stiff1 ] ( c ) , we also find that the average contact time fraction with the slope , @xmath97 , is a decreasing function of @xmath63 in the soft region , but it seems to approach a constant value for large enough @xmath63 .",
    "the logarithmic @xmath63 dependences of @xmath96 and the constant @xmath97 in large @xmath63 region agree with our previous analysis of `` inelastic collapse under gravity '' in the soft sphere model in section [ sec:2.4 ] .",
    "the motion of the particle in one period is as follows ; when the particle comes to a bump ( a particle attached to the slope ) , the particle jumps up , bounces on the bump many times , loses the relative velocity , and finally rolls down keeping in contact with the bump .",
    "therefore , the contact time fraction has a finite value even in the hard sphere limit due to the rolling motion at the last part .",

    "it turns out that the steady state is not unique and fluctuation is large . depending on the initial conditions",
    ", the particles may flow with a different value of average kinetic energy , or in some cases , the whole system stops .",
    "we presume that this is mainly because the system is not large enough : grains form a layer structure as in fig . [ snapfri ] , and the flow velocity strongly depends on the configuration of particles in the bottom layer .",

    "this large fluctuation should be averaged out if we could simulate large enough system for long enough time , but the amount of computation is too large especially for the system with stiff particles .    in order to make meaningful comparison out of these largely fluctuating data with a variety of behaviors , we select simulation sequences that come from similar flowing behaviors in the following way .",

    "the multiple contact time fraction may be estimated by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "the comparison with the present results is not simple because of the different set up , but if we normalize their parameter of normal stiffness with the particle mass , the diameter , and the acceleration of gravity , then their values extend over the range where @xmath92 depends on @xmath63 in our simulations .    when we fix one of the particles on the slope and employ the same force law as eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn ] ) , then we have the duration of contact for the normal collision without gravity @xmath121 for identical particles . the force law for the flat boundary that replace @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn ] ) by the mass of the colliding particle @xmath76 gives the same duration of contact with the above one for the normal collision .",
    "as for the softest case , @xmath122 , we had to include the data whose energy goes below the lower limit because of the general tendency that the energy becomes small for the steady part of the very soft region .",
    "for @xmath123 , however , we did not see any general trend in the average energy ."
