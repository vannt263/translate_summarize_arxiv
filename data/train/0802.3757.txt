    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah s ) are hydrocarbon compounds with multiple six - membered aromatic rings . such species are thought to be a common component of the interstellar medium in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "pah s are typically observed in infra - red emission bands following excitation by either ultra - violet or visible radiation in assorted regions of the interstellar medium exposed to radiation . despite all attempts ,",
    "no specific types of pah s responsible for these features have been identified , and the form and intensity of the spectra vary strongly from one region to another @xcite , probably reflecting a variety of sizes and abundances .",
    "the origin of pah s also remains an unanswered question .",
    "most believe that pah s are formed in the atmospheres of carbon stars or in supernovae @xcite .",
    "various observations show that the abundance of small free - flying pah s have a tendency to decrease in dense clouds where uv photons do not penetrate .",
    "proposed that pah s form larger pah s or pah - clusters in such dense regions . as a consequence ,",
    "free - flying pah s observed at the border of illuminated clouds may be the result of photodissociation of these larger species .",
    "although they determined a minimal size of 400 carbons for these species using mid - infrared isocam maps of photodissociation regions ( pdr s ) , this number is very uncertain .",
    "if free - flying pah s are not present in the dense interstellar medium , an efficient process is needed to aggregate them .",
    "aggregation is poorly understood , and the time in which this process occurs and the fraction of small pah s remaining in dense clouds unexposed to intense radiation are undetermined .",
    "currently , constraints on the pah size and abundance as a function of the physical conditions in the dense interstellar medium remain weak . in this article , we focus not on the size of pah s but on the chemical impact of their presence in the dense cold interstellar cores .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity of our results to size will be examined .",
    "we follow past authors by lumping all pah s into three groups of species : neutral , positively charged , and negatively charged pah s , designated pah , pah@xmath1 , and pah@xmath0 respectively . of these three groupings ,",
    "pah@xmath1 species were found to be unimportant and were excluded from the detailed calculations .",
    "the chemical effect of pah s at steady - state has been studied previously . in the diffuse",
    "interstellar medium , the inclusion of pah s , among other effects , enhances the neutralization of atomic ions such as carbon , silicon and sulfur , reducing their abundances @xcite . in their study of dense cloud chemistry",
    ", @xcite concluded that for pah s consisting of molecules with 30 - 50 carbon atoms , with a fractional abundances greater than @xmath2 , pah@xmath3 is the main source of negative charge , which considerably changes the abundances of some neutral species , enhancing , for example , the abundances of carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "finally , @xcite studied the importance of pah s for c - shock models . in this article",
    ", we report a time - dependent study of the role of pah s in the gas - phase chemistry of cold dense clouds and compare our results with observations .",
    "one focus of our study will be how the presence of pah s affects the choice of elemental abundances .",
    "the elemental abundances typically used for chemical models of dense clouds are referred to by the appellation `` low - metal '' .",
    "originally defined by @xcite , these abundances are based on the _ copernicus _ satellite observations of the @xmath4 ophiuchi diffuse region @xcite .",
    "but , in order to reproduce the observation of molecules in dense clouds better , the @xmath4 oph abundances of all the elements but , he , c , n and o are decreased by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this assumption implies that a strong depletion of the heavier elements occurs between the diffuse and dense cloud phases @xcite .",
    "although the details of this depletion are not understood , the depleted abundances are necessary to reproduce the abundances of molecular ions and , to a lesser extent , carbon - bearing species .",
    "since the presence of pah s in dense clouds should modify the ionization fraction , it may help in solving the problem of the choice of elemental abundances .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ pah_model ] , we describe the parameters of the pah s used for the analysis and the chemical processes involving them . in sect .",
    "[ model_other ] , other details of the chemical model are given .",
    "the influence of pah s on the abundances of smaller species is reported in the next section , while the sensitivity of the results to the pah parameters is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sensitivity ] . in sect .  6",
    ", we compare observations in molecular clouds with grids of models in which we vary several parameters , including pah size and abundance .",
    "the paper ends with our conclusions .",
    "@xcite reproduced the extinction curves of various diffuse regions of the milky way from _ spitzer _ observations and constrained the size distribution of carbonaceous grains including pah s down to 3@xmath5 in size ( see fig .",
    "6 of * ? ? ?",
    "using the model @xmath6 of @xcite , which has the largest abundance of small pah s , we integrated over a radius range of 3.8 to 6.0@xmath5 on radius @xmath7 for pah s is not well - known since it depends on the structure of the molecule .",
    "we used the relation given by @xcite : @xmath8 . the radius range here then corresponds to pah s with between 25 and 100 carbon atoms . ] .",
    "the integration yields a mean radius of 4  @xmath5 ( @xmath9 ) and an integrated fractional abundance with respect to @xmath10 of @xmath11 . multiplying by 30 leads to a fractional abundance of c atoms in pah s of @xmath12 , or roughly 3% of the elemental carbon abundance .",
    "because pah s may not be free in dense clouds , we decided to also consider pah - clusters of radius 10 and 100 @xmath5 . with the formula of @xcite",
    ", these limits correspond to pah s with 468 and @xmath13 carbon atoms , leading to fractional abundances of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , if one assumes ( a ) the same atomic carbon abundance in pah s as for the smaller species , and ( b ) that weakly - bound clusters can also be approximated by the same relationship between number of carbon atoms and size .",
    "@xcite and found that the abundance of pah@xmath16 decreases strongly in clouds with an a@xmath17 larger than 2 and @xcite found that the abundance of pah@xmath16 is smaller than the abundance of the other forms of pah s by about one order of magnitude in their calculations .",
    "for this reason , in our study of dense cloud chemistry , we did not originally include cations but only neutral and negatively - charged pah s .",
    "prodded by the referee , however , we looked more carefully at the role of pah@xmath16 , but concluded again that their exclusion is justified .",
    "the reconsideration will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we start the chemistry with neutral pah s only , based on the results of @xcite and .",
    "neutral pah s become negatively charged very rapidly and our results after a very small time interval do not depend on whether the chemistry commences with pah or pah@xmath3 .",
    "the main problem of including pah s in chemical models is that few experimental measurements of reaction rates have been performed on these molecules , and these few tend to involve rather small cationic pah s only .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the rates of the reactions between a variety of positively - charged pah s with six , ten , and sixteen carbon atoms and the neutrals h , o , n , and h@xmath18 , while @xcite studied reactions of coronene cation ( c@xmath19h@xmath20 ) with the same reactants .",
    "although association reactions appear to be dominant , most the experiments were done at sufficiently high densities that the mechanism , three - body association , is not what occurs in the low - density interstellar medium . moreover , cationic pah s are not important in our study .",
    "the processes in our model include electron attachment , recombination of negative pah ions with smaller positive ions , and photodetachment of negative pah ions by uv radiation .",
    "we consider these in turn .",
    "negative pah ions are formed by radiative electron attachment : @xmath21 the rate coefficient for this reaction is thought to depend on the size of the pah .",
    "and @xcite proposed two different relations : @xmath22  @xmath23  s@xmath24 and @xmath25  @xmath23  s@xmath24 .",
    "these two formulae lead to differences of about a factor of 2 for pah s with @xmath26 .",
    "we arbitrarily decided to follow @xcite and use the first formula .",
    "the rate coefficient is @xmath27  @xmath23  s@xmath24 for the attachment of electrons to neutral pah s with 30 carbons .",
    "the results depend on this value only if @xmath28 is decreased by a factor of 100 . in other words ,",
    "an increase of this rate coefficient does not change the results .",
    "calculations by herbst ( in preparation ) based on the statistical approach of @xcite indicate that with typical electron affinities in the range of 0.5 - 1.0 ev , the large rate coefficients deduced by previous authors are valid for neutral pah s with 30 carbon atoms , but not for those significantly smaller , in agreement with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "negatively - charged pah s can recombine with positive ions , designated x@xmath16 .",
    "these recombination reactions differ from dissociative recombination of positive ions with electrons in two important ways @xcite .",
    "first , they are less exothermic because of the electron affinity of the pah .",
    "secondly , some of the reaction exothermicity can be deposited in internal energy of the pah so that less is available to dissociate the positive ion upon neutralization .",
    "we assume that two resulting channels are possible for these recombinations , simple charge exchange : @xmath29 and , if the positive ion contains hydrogen : @xmath30 where x designates a neutral with one fewer h atom than the ion .",
    "the terms `` neutralization '' and `` dissociative neutralization '' are used for these two processes to distinguish them from recombination with electrons .",
    "we assume equal branching fractions for the two sets of products , if they exist .",
    "if the neutralization leads to a neutral species that does not exist or is not included in the model , only the second channel is considered .",
    "the products of the dissociation are very uncertain , and laboratory experiments are required .",
    "the rate coefficients for these reactions have been computed by taking into account the coulomb attraction between the charged species via the expression @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electronic charge , @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 is the radius of the pah ( or pah cluster ) , and @xmath34 is the mean relative velocity between pah@xmath3 and ions , which is given by the expression @xmath35 with @xmath36 the temperature and @xmath37 the reduced mass , which is mainly determined by the mass of x@xmath16 . in expression ( [ k_grain_mol ] ) , we have assumed that the radius of the pah is the critical radius for which reaction can occur .",
    "the radius at which the second term equals the first term on the right - hand - side is approximately 1  @xmath37 m at 10  k. this radius is much larger than the pah radii considered here , so that @xmath38 .",
    "the rate coefficient at 10 k is approximately @xmath39 @xmath40 s@xmath24 for an ion of 30 amu and a pah of 4  @xmath5 .",
    "relation  ( [ k_grain_mol ] ) is based on the fact that , due to the delocalization of the negative charge on the pah , the trajectory of the positive ion as it approaches the pah will always be affected by this charge .",
    "taking into account the complex shape and large number of possible pah clusters in dense clouds , several negative charges may stick , and the attraction between such a system and a positive ion may depend on the localization of the electrons in the cluster . as a consequence ,",
    "expression  ( [ k_grain_mol ] ) may be more likely to be correct for small pah s of 4@xmath5 radius than for larger ones .",
    "for this reason , we consider the alternative possibility that rate coefficients for the reactions between @xmath41 and x@xmath16 are given by the simple ballistic relation @xmath42 for small pah s , the rate coefficient varies as @xmath7 whereas for large pah s , if the process is ballistic , it varies as @xmath43 .",
    "for a 100 @xmath5 pah and an ion of 30 amu , the rate coefficient at 10 k is then approximately @xmath44 @xmath40 s@xmath24 , or 0.1 of the value for the smaller pah s .",
    "in addition to these reactions , pah@xmath3 is neutralized by photodetachment of electrons due to ultraviolet , visible , and even near infra - red photons : @xmath45 following @xcite , we assume a cross section of 10@xmath46 @xmath47 significantly above threshold , which is the electron affinity ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . for a standard interstellar radiation field",
    ", this leads to a conservative estimate for the rate coefficient in the absence of shielding of approximately 10@xmath48 s@xmath24 , neglecting differences in electron affinities among pah s . a crude estimate of the dependence on @xmath49 is given by the simple exponent @xmath50 .",
    "even with an @xmath49 of 10 , the rate is not negligible in dense clouds . indeed , under most conditions , photodetachment is more rapid than neutralization , but it must be remembered also that the electrons produced in photodetachment then attach to neutral pah .",
    "we do not consider photodetachment by cosmic ray - induced photons .",
    "if we assume a rate coefficient of @xmath51 for this process @xcite , the photodetachment by direct uv photons is then more efficient by one order of magnitude even at an @xmath52 of 10 .    in our original calculations",
    ", we did not include pah@xmath1 .",
    "in dense clouds , positively charged pah s can be produced by secondary uv photons induced by cosmic - rays and by charge transfer with small positive ions x@xmath1 .",
    "the latter process can neutralize the x@xmath1 abundance and so affect the small - molecule chemistry",
    ". then pah@xmath16 can be destroyed by recombination with free electrons . as suggested by the referee , we tested the importance of positively - charged pah species using rate coefficients from @xcite for pah@xmath16 production by photoionization and for recombination with electrons . for the charge - transfer reactions , we used rate coefficients computed with the langevin theory and the polarizability from .",
    "as an example , the couloub - based rate coefficient for the recombination reaction between pah@xmath3 and x@xmath53 is @xmath54 @xmath40 s@xmath24 for pah s of 4 @xmath5 and an ion of 30 amu whereas the rate coefficient for the charge - transfer reaction between pah and x@xmath16 for the same ion is @xmath55 @xmath40 s@xmath24 . in the various models that we ran , we found that the abundance of pah@xmath16 is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the pah and pah@xmath3 abundances .",
    "moreover , its inclusion does not affect any of the results discussed below .",
    "this conclusion holds even when the recombination rate coefficient is the ballistic one .",
    "we utilize a pseudo - time - dependent gas - phase model , which computes the chemical evolution at a fixed temperature and density .",
    "a version of this model ( nahoon ) is now available online at + ` http://www.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/radio/vwakelam/valentine\\%20wakelam/downloads.html ` .",
    "the chemical database is a recent version of the osu network : ` osu_01_2007 ` , which can be found online at ` http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~eric/research.html ` .",
    "the reactions involving pah s will also be available at the same address .",
    "we use three different sets of elemental abundances ( ea1 , ea2 and ea3 ) , which are listed in table  1 with respect to the total nuclear hydrogen abundance along with the initial choice of ionization .",
    "ea1 represents the low - metal abundances discussed earlier .",
    "ea2 is based on the high - metal abundances observed in the @xmath4 ophiuchi diffuse cloud , but is modified based on recent observations .",
    "the abundance of helium has not been observed in cold cores and we use a value of 0.09 for ea2 with respect to hydrogen , based on observations in the orion nebula @xcite . to account for the oxygen and carbon that are depleted on grain mantles in the form of h@xmath56o and",
    "co , we removed 2.4% of c and 13% of o .",
    "it is possible that the metals are more depleted in dense clouds than in diffuse regions .",
    "thus , for ea3 , we assumed that the silicon and magnesium are totally depleted on grains and we assumed an abundance of @xmath57 for iron as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the complete depletion of si is one explanation for the non - detection of sio in dense clouds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also considered an additional depletion of a factor of 10 for chlorine as suggested by the observation of hcl in cold material around omc-1 @xcite .",
    "note that in all the elemental abundances that we considered , the elemental c / o ratio is 0.4 .",
    "the species are assumed to be initially in atomic form except for hydrogen , which is assumed to be entirely in its molecular form .",
    "we consider typical physical conditions for dense clouds : a temperature of 10  k , an h@xmath56 density of @xmath58  @xmath59 , a cosmic - ray ionization rate @xmath4 of @xmath60  s@xmath24 and a visual extinction @xmath49 of 10 .",
    "in this section , we present results for the three sets of elemental abundances ( ea1 , ea2 and ea3 ) with and without pah s . in",
    "the models with pah s , referred to as ea / pah , we assume their fractional abundance to be @xmath11 , our standard value for small pah s .",
    "variations in this value will be considered in sect .",
    "[ sensitivity ] and [ comp_obs ] .",
    "figure  [ fract_ion ] shows the ionization fraction ( sum of the negatively or positively charged species ) as a function of time for the three sets of elemental abundances , each with and without pah s .",
    "the initial ionization is typical of a diffuse cloud since we start with ionized carbon in all models . with low - metal elemental abundances ( ea1 ) and no pah s",
    ", the ionization fraction stays high for only @xmath61  yr and then decreases sharply , reaching a steady - state value of @xmath62 by 10@xmath63 yr . with both ea2 and ea3 , and no pah s ,",
    "the ionization fraction decreases slowly , remaining larger than @xmath64 for about @xmath58  yr and eventually reaching a steady - state value of a few @xmath65 .",
    "when pah s are added , the ionization fraction does not depend significantly on the elemental abundances .",
    "the main effect is to sharply decrease the earlier ionization fraction of the gas : within the first 300  yr , the ionization fraction goes from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , its steady - state value , which is only slightly larger than that achieved with the ea1 model .",
    "thus , the inclusion of pah s reduces the ionization fraction for ea2 and ea3 to a value close to that achieved with low - metal abundances and no pah s . the steady - state ionization fraction for model ea1/pah is larger by a factor of 2 compared with model ea1 without pah s .",
    "the ionization fraction of model ea2/pah at steady - state can be compared with the very similar value of @xmath68 reported by @xcite for a ratio of total pah to hydrogen of @xmath65 and high - metal abundances .",
    "figure  [ e_pah ] depicts the fractional abundances of neutral and negatively - charged pah s as well as the electron abundance as functions of time for model ea2/pah .",
    "the other pah models are not shown because these abundances do not depend significantly on the chosen elemental abundances . by 300  yr , the fractional abundances of electrons and pah@xmath3 drop to @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively , so that pah@xmath3 becomes the dominant negatively - charged species .",
    "the conversion of neutral to negatively - charged pah s occurs via electron attachment , which is very efficient at early times because of the high electron abundance .",
    "but , once formed , pah@xmath3 is efficiently destroyed by reactions with atomic ions , which are also very abundant at the beginning of the chemical evolution .",
    "note that the recombination of atomic ions is much more efficient with pah s than with electrons since the latter must occur radiatively .",
    "for instance , the neutralization of c@xmath16 by pah@xmath3 ( with @xmath71 ) is four orders of magnitude larger than by electrons at 10  k. because of this efficient neutralization , the ionization fraction of the gas decreases much more quickly when pah s are present ( see fig .",
    "[ fract_ion ] ) .",
    "we also find that the abundance of neutral pah s exceeds that of the anionic pah s by a factor of 5 - 10 after 300 yr , which is also in agreement with the steady - state results of @xcite .      in the absence of pah s , the higher - metal elemental abundances ea2 and ea3 lead to a very different chemistry from ea1 , and tend to worsen the agreement between the modeling results and the observations for selected classes of molecules @xcite . with models ea2/pah and ea3/pah , however , the chemistry is much closer to that computed with the low metal elemental abundances in the absence of pah s .",
    "the major change in the chemistry is caused by the high abundance of pah@xmath0 , which neutralizes atomic positive ions efficiently and , upon reaction with positive molecular ions , tends to neutralize them without significant dissociation , contrary to dissociative recombination reactions with electrons .",
    "in addition , the decrease of the ionization fraction at initial stages of the chemistry increases the abundance of ionic species such as h@xmath72 and h@xmath73o@xmath16 because they are depleted more slowly . at later times , some of the c- , s- , n - bearing species are enhanced in the models ea2/pah and ea3/pah because of i ) larger elemental abundances and ii ) a smaller electron abundance .",
    "we now present the results for the most important species and for selected molecules that show significant differences among models .      in figure [ c_fam ] , we show our results for c and c@xmath16 as functions of time for the three elemental abundances with and without pah s . as expected , the fractional abundance of ionized carbon is decreased most rapidly when the pah s are included .",
    "the agreement at steady - state for the model ea2/pah is in reasonable agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the c@xmath16 neutralization by pah@xmath3 is that atomic carbon becomes the main reservoir of carbon earlier than with the models without pah s . at the age of dense clouds , between @xmath74 and @xmath75  yr",
    ", atomic carbon is more abundant in ea2 and ea3 compared with ea1 because of a higher elemental abundance of carbon .",
    "our steady - state fractional abundance of neutral carbon ( @xmath76 ) in model ea2/pah is three orders of magnitude below that of the analogous model in @xcite .",
    "after early time , co becomes the main repository of carbon in all models ; the co abundance ( not shown in the figure ) is insensitive to the model used .",
    "the rapid decrease of the electron abundance in the models with pah s leads to strong increases in the abundances of molecular ions such as h@xmath72 , h@xmath73o@xmath16 and hco@xmath16 and neutral species formed from them at the initial stage of the chemistry , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ oh_fam ] . at longer times",
    ", the ionic abundances show much less time dependence , with two general but not universal patterns : ( i ) they are more abundant in the models with pah s than in the analogous models without them , and ( ii ) they are most abundant in models with ea1 abundances and least abundant in models with ea2 abundances , with and without pah s .",
    "general reasons for the trends include the higher electron abundances in models ea2 and ea3 , the slower depletion rates by negatively charged species ( mainly pah@xmath0 ) in the pah - containing models , and differences in abundances of important neutral species involved in depletion processes among the pah - containing models .    the ion h@xmath77 is a partial exception to the trends in that its abundance is not enhanced by pah s at later times , mainly because it is destroyed principally by heavy neutral species such as co and h@xmath18o rather than by charged species .",
    "the abundance in ea2 and ea3 is smaller than in ea1 because of dissociative recombination by more abundant electrons whereas it is smaller in ea2/pah and ea3/pah than in ea1/pah because of reaction with h@xmath56o , which is more abundant in the high - metal models .",
    "the enhancement in the ion hco@xmath1 for models with pah s in the initial stages of the chemistry is even more dramatic than that of h@xmath77 because of its formation from abundant carbon atoms , by reactions leading first to ch@xmath78 . at later times",
    ", hco@xmath16 is formed by the reaction between h@xmath72 and co in all models . without pah s ,",
    "hco@xmath16 is destroyed by electrons whereas it is destroyed by h@xmath56o in models with pah s .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath79o@xmath1 is also dramatically enhanced in the initial stages of the chemistry in the presence of pah s . without pah s ,",
    "h@xmath73o@xmath16 is destroyed by electrons whereas it is destroyed by pah@xmath3 in ea1/pah and ea3/pah . in ea2/pah ,",
    "due to a large abundance of elemental silicon , h@xmath73o@xmath16 reacts with gas phase sio , which is as abundant as @xmath80 at @xmath75  yr .",
    "such a large abundance of sio is in disagreement with observations in dense clouds @xcite .",
    "one consequence of the large h@xmath73o@xmath16 abundance , at initial stages of the chemistry , is that the abundances of oh , h@xmath56o and o@xmath56 , which stem from the recombination and neutralization of h@xmath79o@xmath1 , are also enhanced in pah - containing models .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complex at later times with only water showing a much higher abundance in pah - containing models .",
    "the predicted enhancement of h@xmath56o in pah - containing models is a problem because the calculated abundances far exceed the observational upper limits of @xmath81 in l134n and @xmath82 in tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "the result for molecular oxygen is , on the contrary , not affected by pah s at times after 10@xmath63 yr .",
    "our theoretical o@xmath56 abundance is about @xmath69 at @xmath74  yr using ea2/pah or ea3/pah , which compares favorably with the observational upper limits of @xmath83 in l134n and @xmath84 in tmc-1 .",
    "the computed abundances of the hydrocarbons c - c@xmath73h@xmath56 ( cyclopropenylidene ) , c@xmath73h@xmath85 ( methyl acetylene ) , c@xmath86h@xmath56 ( triacetylene ) and ch@xmath73c@xmath85h ( methyl diacetylene ) are shown in fig .",

    "although the enhancement is significantly greater for ea2 and ea3 , the peak ea1 values are still the largest .",
    "the enhancements are caused mainly by the lesser destructive effect of pah@xmath0 compared with electrons when it reacts with intermediate ions in the chain of synthetic reactions , although in individual cases secondary effects can be isolated .",
    "the major effect , which comprises both lower rates and larger product neutral channels , is stronger than the enhancement in destruction rates of hydrocarbons due to often larger abundances of molecular ions .",
    "that differences remain among the pah models despite the fact that pah@xmath0 has the same abundance shows , once again , that other processes are also important .",
    "the computed abundances of hydrocarbons at steady - state can be very different from the results of @xcite .",
    "for example , the c@xmath73h@xmath56 abundance is @xmath87 in model ea2/pah whereas it is @xmath88 in @xcite",
    ". this difference may be due to discrepancies in the network for carbon chemistry .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ch_fam ] , the abundances of the oxygen - containing organic neutral molecules hcooh , ch@xmath56co , ch@xmath73oh and ch@xmath73cho in models containing pah s are enhanced at almost all times by at least one order of magnitude over the abundances in models without pah s . once again , the reason is generally the same as for the hydrocarbons : neutralization reactions between precursor ions with pah@xmath0 are not as destructive as dissociative recombination reactions with electrons .",
    "even if a species , such as ketene , is formed by a neutral - neutral reaction , its precursor is likely formed at least partially through ion - molecule channels .",
    "an as example , consider the case of methanol .",
    "methanol ( ch@xmath79oh ) is produced through the ion ch@xmath79oh@xmath89 , which itself is formed via the radiative association between ch@xmath77 and water . in models without pah s ,",
    "the protonated ion can recombine dissociatively with electrons to form ch@xmath79oh + h , although this channel is now known to be a minor one @xcite .",
    "with pah@xmath0 , on the other hand , we assume that this channel is the only one , since the neutral form ch@xmath79oh@xmath18 does not exist and we only allow one hydrogen to be ejected from the species ( see section  [ pah_chem ] ) .",
    "another reason for the enhanced abundance of methanol lies in the enhanced abundance of water .",
    "we note that with pah s , the peak predicted fractional abundance of methanol is still 1 - 2 orders of magnitude below the typical value in cold dense clouds of 10@xmath90 @xcite .    unlike the situation with the hydrocarbons , the abundances in models ea2/pah and ea3/pah are not significantly less and sometimes even greater than those in model ea1/pah .",
    "the small differences suggest that pah@xmath0 plays an even more dominant role than in the case of the hydrocarbons . in the non - pah models , although the ea1 abundances tend to be greater than those in ea2 and ea3 , the effect is smaller than for hydrocarbons except for acetaldehyde .",
    "cyanopolyynes are very abundant towards the famous cyanopolyyne peak ( cp ) of the cold core tmc1 , yet their abundances are under produced by gas - phase models unless a high c / o elemental abundance ratio is assumed @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hcn_fam ] , the pah s have a strong enhancing effect on the formation of these molecules , especially on the more complex cyanopolyynes . once again , there is little difference among the results for the three pah models .",
    "in general , the dominant formation mechanism for each cyanopolyyne more complex than hc@xmath79n involves the next smaller member of the series . at @xmath74",
    "yr , the hc@xmath91n , hc@xmath92n and hc@xmath93n abundances are enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude over their values without pah s .",
    "the peak fractional abundances are indeed larger than the values observed in tmc1 ( cp ) of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for hc@xmath91n , hc@xmath92n and hc@xmath93n respectively ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the elemental abundance of sulfur is smaller by more than 2 orders of magnitude in ea1 compared with the two other sets of elemental abundances . as a consequence ,",
    "most of the sulfur - bearing species have larger abundances with high - metal abundances at all times , with and without pah s . in fig .  [ s_fam ]",
    ", we follow the temporal evolution of four species : ocs , h@xmath56s , cs and c@xmath73s .",
    "three of these molecules tend to have enhanced peak abundances in the presence of pah s , although the situation is more complex towards steady - state .",
    "the exceptional cases are cs for all elemental abundances and h@xmath18s for the low - metal case .",
    "the cs molecule is produced by the dissociative recombination of hcs@xmath16 and hc@xmath56h@xmath16 by electrons or dissociative neutralization of hcs@xmath16 by pah@xmath3 .",
    "the larger ion hc@xmath56h@xmath16 does not react with pah@xmath0 to produce cs with our assumptions . as a consequence ,",
    "the abundance of cs is smaller in the models including the pah s .",
    "the late - time situation regarding h@xmath18s is more complex .",
    "the primary formation mechanism for h@xmath18s at most times is through the protonated precursor h@xmath79s@xmath1 , which is formed by a chain of reactions starting with s + h@xmath77 and proceeding through hs@xmath1 and h@xmath18s@xmath1 . without pah s ,",
    "h@xmath56s is also produced by the charge exchange between h@xmath56s@xmath16 and s. the ion h@xmath56s@xmath16 is more abundant in the low - metal case without pah s because it is produced by the reaction @xmath97 where s@xmath16 is more abundant than the neutral form in the absence of pah s .",
    "there are some observational and theoretical indications that pah s in dense clouds may be aggregated into clusters with radius up to 100  @xmath5 .",
    "we have performed additional calculations using the three elemental abundances and pah - clusters of radii 10 @xmath5 and 100 @xmath5 with the reduced abundances discussed in sect .",
    "[ pah_model ] . in our discussion of the results , we use the word pah",
    "whatever the size . for the larger pah s ( 10 and 100 @xmath5 )",
    ", we consider two expressions for the rate coefficients of the neutralization reactions between pah@xmath0 and positive ions : one involving charge attraction , as expressed in equation ( [ k_grain_mol ] ) , and the other a simple ballistic one , as expressed in equation ( [ k_ball ] ) .",
    "the ballistic rate is considerably lower .",
    "for radii of 10 and 100 @xmath5 and a temperature of 10  k , the ballistic rate is , respectively , about 1000 @xmath98 and 10 @xmath98 smaller than the rate involving charge attraction .",
    "another process with a rate coefficient that depends on the pah size is the radiative attachment of electrons to neutral pah s , which increases with increasing radius . in fig .",
    "[ fract_othermod ] , we show the ionization fraction as a function of time with each set of elemental abundances and pah s of 4 , 10 , and 100 @xmath5 . as can be seen , the ionization fraction depends highly on the size of the pah , and on whether or not charge attraction is considered .",
    "we do not show the dependence on the total abundance of c atoms incorporated into pah s , but a larger abundance implies a more rapid decrease of the ionization fraction to a smaller value at late times .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fract_othermod ] , neutralization proceeds with charge attraction for all three sizes of pah s .",
    "for the two smaller sizes of pah s , the main negatively - charged species in the model remains pah@xmath3 .",
    "for the pah s of 100 @xmath5 radius , the total abundance of pah s is @xmath15 , much smaller than the abundance of electrons .",
    "the evolution of the ionization fraction is then closer to the case without pah s , but the steady - state ionization fraction can still be somewhat lower . for the case with model ea1 and the largest pah s , the ionization fraction is the same with or without charge attraction and is not different from the model in which there are no pah s at all . as a consequence ,",
    "the 10 @xmath5 and ( for ea2 and ea3 ) the 100 @xmath5 cases represent intermediate stages between the models with 4 @xmath5 pah s and those without pah s .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fract_othermod ] shows the results when positive ion - pah@xmath3 neutralization occurs ballistically for the larger pah s . in this case , the 10 @xmath5 and 100 @xmath5 cases give very similar results to the model without pah s so that the effect of large pah s at the chosen abundances is negligible in dense cloud chemistry .",
    "this effect occurs because the major depletion mechanism for pah@xmath0 is photodetachment rather than recombination with positive ions , so that lowered neutralization rates have the sole effect of decoupling pah@xmath0 from the ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "the modification of the ionization fraction has consequences for the abundances of species . in general , pah s of 100 @xmath5 ( considering charge attraction or not ) and of 10 @xmath5 without charge attraction lead to abundances similar to the models without pah s . for most of the species , pah s of 10 @xmath5 with charge attraction give intermediate abundances between the case of very small 4 @xmath5 pah s and the case without pah s",
    "many species such as c , c@xmath16 h@xmath72 , hco@xmath16 and oh show a difference smaller than a factor of two while using larger pah s of 10 @xmath5 instead of smaller pah s of 4  @xmath5 .",
    "some species are largely underproduced using the elemental abundances ea2 and ea3 without pahs .",
    "this is the case for c@xmath73h@xmath56 , c@xmath73h@xmath85 , c@xmath86h@xmath56 , ch@xmath73c@xmath85h , ch@xmath73cho and cyanoppolyynes . in the presence of 10 @xmath5 pah s , these species are almost as abundant as with smaller pah s .",
    "the objective of this section is to study the impact of pah s on the comparison with observations in the two cold cores l134n ( north peak ) and tmc-1 ( cyanopolyyne peak ) .",
    "these two clouds are known to show differences in the abundances of c - rich molecules that are sometimes explained by differences in age or c / o ratio . here",
    "we explore the possibility that they are also explained by the amount and size of pah s present .",
    "the observed abundances in l134n ( north peak ) and tmc-1 ( cyanopolyyne peak ) are listed in tables 3 and 4 of @xcite .",
    "in addition to these species , comprising 42 molecules for l134n and 53 for tmc-1 , we considered sio , for which only upper limits of @xmath99 for l134n and @xmath100 for tmc1 have been determined @xcite .    in this comparison , we utilize the three different sets of elemental abundances listed in table  1 .",
    "of all these elements , sulfur is the least constrained by abundances of gas - phase molecules gas - phase abundances so that the depleted fraction is uncertain @xcite .",
    "pah size and abundance are also poorly determined parameters .",
    "instead of fixing these parameters to previously used values , we try to give some trends by comparing observations with grids of models in which these three parameters are varied in addition to time .",
    "we computed 441 models by varying the abundance of elemental sulfur between @xmath2 and @xmath101 , the abundance of pah s between @xmath102 and @xmath65 and the size of pah s between 4 and 400  @xmath5 .",
    "note that the largest values of pah sizes and abundances used here are not in agreement with the relation @xmath8 used in the first part of the article .",
    "considering the little information available on the relation of size to number of carbons for pahs , in particular for pah clusters , we consider the pah size and abundance as independent .",
    "the agreement between present models and observations quantified using statistical comparisons , @xmath103 minimization for instance , is not good enough to give reasonable constraints on model parameters .",
    "for this reason , we did not use such methods but instead for each model and each time , we count the number of species with fractional abundance x reproduced by the model within one order of magnitude ( @xmath104 ) where @xmath105 is the observed abundance and @xmath106 the computed abundance . for those species for which only upper limits to their abundances are known and for the case of atomic carbon , for which only a lower limit is known , we check that the predicted abundance is in agreement with the observed limit",
    "when this is the case , we consider that the species is reproduced .      figures  [ l134n ] and [ tmc1 ] show the maximum percentage of species reproduced in each cloud as a function of the parameters chosen .",
    "column ( a ) shows the level of agreement as a function of pah size and abundance , with each point optimized for the best elemental abundance of sulfur and the best time . column ( b ) shows the level of agreement as a function of the elemental abundance of sulfur and the time optimized at each point for the best pah parameters .",
    "finally , column ( c ) shows the agreement as a function of the elemental abundance of sulfur and the time for models without pah s .",
    "these results are shown for each set of elemental abundances ( 1 : ea1 , 2 : ea2 and 3 : ea3 ) .",
    "best agreement , with or without pah s , is most often achieved at so - called early times of @xmath107 yr . moreover , high levels of agreement can not be achieved with high abundances of pah clusters , as shown in the upper - right corners in column 1 for both figures .",
    "the maximum percentage of molecules reproduced depends on all the parameters , and several solutions exist .",
    "pah s do not improve significantly the best agreement for l134n ( already above 70% without pah s ) but they do expand the range of parameters ( time and elemental abundance of sulfur ) for which we have an agreement larger than 70% , especially if elemental abundances 1 or 2 are utilized .",
    "note particularly the expanded range of agreement with the use of elemental abundances 2 ( the high - metal ones ) .",
    "the optimum pah parameters corresponding to the yellow zones in column b do not depend on the optimum sulfur abundance . as an example",
    ", high agreement is obtained with @xmath108 abundance of 4@xmath5 pah s both for low ( @xmath109 ) and high ( @xmath110 ) elemental abundance of sulfur .",
    "the chemistry in tmc-1 on the contrary is better reproduced if pah s are present , as can be seen immediately by comparison of columns b and c in figure [ tmc1 ] . without pah s , agreement rarely extends to more than 60% , while with pah s , agreement in excess of 70% exists for all three sets of elemental abundances . for elemental abundances 1 ,",
    "the pah parameters are relatively unconstrained ; while for the high - metal abundances ( ea2 ) , high abundances of small pah s are needed .",
    "the situation is less clear for ea3 .",
    "for both clouds , we find isolated areas of agreement larger than 70% at very early times , @xmath111  yr , for large abundances of sulfur ( @xmath112 ) and big ( @xmath113 ) pah s ( @xmath114 ) if ea2 and/or ea3 is utilized .",
    "such agreement is of mathematical interest only .",
    "most chemical studies of the dense interstellar medium rely purely on gas - phase processes . a few contain , in addition ,",
    "a varying amount of surface chemistry on interstellar grains but the inclusion of pah s , which occupy a middle ground in size between small gas - phase species and dust particles , is quite rare .",
    "part of the reason for this neglect is that to include pah s properly , one should view them as individual species .",
    "but the actual individual species that make up the pah content of interstellar clouds are not well constrained from spectral observations , and even their chemistry has not been studied in great detail .",
    "so , inclusion of pah s means that one must treat them as small grains , and follow just their charge state . in this study , as in previous ones , we lump all pah s into just three groups , depending on whether they are neutral , positively - charged , or negatively - charged .",
    "positively - charged pah s were initially assumed to be unimportant in cold dense sources , an assumption that was confirmed upon the request of the referee .",
    "they were not included in the chemical network used for the results presented here . by including an assortment of chemical processes involving negatively - charged and neutral pah s into our standard gas - phase network of reactions , we are able to determine the effect of pah s on the time - dependent gas - phase chemistry of cold and dense interstellar cloud cores",
    ". the gas - phase model employed is known as ` osu_01_2007 ` , and can be downloaded from the url http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/@xmath115eric/research.html . to this model",
    ", we add electron attachment to neutral pah s , neutralization between negatively - charged pah s and positively - charged smaller ions , and photodetachment of negatively - charged pah s by external photons .",
    "our standard model contains a fractional abundance of @xmath116 pah s of size 4 @xmath5 , corresponding to 30 carbon atoms .",
    "in addition to this model , we vary the size and abundance of the pah s to study the impact of these parameters on the chemistry .",
    "we also use three different sets of elemental abundances with different abundances of heavy atoms .    in general , the dominant effect in our calculations",
    "is that electrons are replaced by pah@xmath0 as the dominant negative charge carrier , an effect which weakens and eventually vanishes as the size of the pah s , due probably to clustering , and their fractional abundance decrease .",
    "when the abundance of pah@xmath0 exceeds that of electrons , the overall ionization fraction is reduced because atomic positive ions are far more rapidly neutralized by reactions with pah@xmath0 than by radiative recombination with electrons .",
    "these changes lead to many secondary effects .",
    "our calculations show that many of the molecular species have abundances that are strongly affected by the presence of pah s .",
    "in particular , molecular ions tend to have increased abundances at most times and large unsaturated neutrals , such as the polyynes , as well as saturated species such as methanol , show very large increases in abundance .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to variations in the size of pah s depends upon assumptions made in the rate of neutralization of pah@xmath0 and positive ions .",
    "the differences among results obtained with different elemental abundances are much smaller in models containing pah s than in models without them .    by comparing observations in the two dense cloud cores l134n and",
    "tmc-1 with grids of models , we showed only that the chemistry in such sources is not consistent with large amounts of large pah clusters .",
    "we are not able to give more severe unambiguous constraints on the pah parameters , since high levels of agreement can exist for large parameter variations .",
    "the situation is similar for the elemental abundance of sulfur , where values over several orders of magnitude are consistent with maximum agreement with observations .",
    "as regards time , both the standard early - time and very early times can lead to optimum agreement , although the latter must be rejected on astronomical grounds .",
    "the situations for l134n and for tmc-1 show differences . for l134n",
    ", the best agreement is not improved when pah s are included , although the range of optimum sulfur elemental abundances and times are extended , most significantly so for the high - metal abundances ( ea 2 ) . for tmc-1 ,",
    "on the other hand , the best level of agreement is significantly better when pah s are included , using any of the three elemental abundances .",
    "this difference may indicate a difference in pah properties between the two regions .",
    "in particular , for ea 2 , optimum agreement in tmc-1 is obtained with smaller and more numerous pah s , while for l134n , such parameters make matters worse . finally , unlike the case of gas - phase models without pah s , models including pah s are able to accommodate high - metal elemental abundances , similar to those observed in the diffuse medium , if the effects of pah s are included and optimized .                                                                                ,",
