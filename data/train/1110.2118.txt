    "the discovery of superconductivity at elevated temperatures in the copper - oxide materials a quarter of a century ago sparked an intense effort to understand the mechanism of the superconductivity in these compounds . despite the wealth of information from the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of scientific papers , there is still no consensus on the pairing mechanism .",

    "this transfer of spectral weight is consistent with the formation of a momentum - dependent gap due to the formation of charge - stripe and spin - stripe order resulting in a nodal metal .",
    "the loss of low - frequency spectral weight also mimics the missing spectral weight observed in the superconducting materials , and it is possible that the transfer of spectral weight is associated with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluctuating superconducting state prior to the onset of bulk 3d superconductivity.@xcite the two dopings for which superconductivity is observed fall on the universal scaling line , @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is measured just above @xmath9),@xcite which is consistent with the observation that there is substantial dissipation in the normal state of these materials .",
