    "<S> nonetheless , the berry flux singularities remain protected by symmetry until the dirac points merge and annihilate @xcite . by using a fixed measurement loop that encloses one dirac point in the intensity - balanced case , we can measure the change of the geometric phase as we imbalance the lattice beam intensities . </S>",

    "<S> to precisely map the location of the berry flux in the imbalanced lattice , we again use the self - referenced interferometry of fig.[fig:3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.[fig:4]b , imbalancing the lattice by decreasing @xmath60 narrows the range of final quasimomenta for which the interferometer encloses a single @xmath0 flux , thereby shifting both the upward and downward phase jumps towards the @xmath61 point . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the phase jump at @xmath62 for @xmath54 is in very good agreement with theory , while deviations of @xmath6310% from the calculated value in the positions of the phase jumps at higher quasimomenta can likely be attributed to a combination of geometric imperfections and the effect of the dynamical instability of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a stronger imbalance ( @xmath60=0.2 ) , the two dirac points have annihilated , and hence no phase jump is observed for any loop size .    to conclude , we have demonstrated the first momentum - resolved measurement of berry curvature , using atom interferometry . by employing a bose - einstein condensate </S>",
    "<S> , we constrain the spread of berry curvature around a dirac point in a hexagonal optical lattice to be smaller than @xmath64 , thereby highlighting both the singular topological nature of a conical intersection and the resolution achievable with this method . </S>",
    "<S> our aharonov - bohm - type interferometer allows one to fully resolve the geometric structure of a single bloch band by combining local measurements of the berry phase along small paths , thereby enabling the full reconstruction of topological invariants such as chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the method can readily be applied to a variety of optical lattices and other physical settings such as polariton condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiband extensions of this work can enable measurements of wilson loops and off - diagonal ( non - abelian ) berry connections and thus provide a framework for the full determination of the geometric tensor of bloch bands in periodic structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> controlled application of non - abelian berry phases would furthermore constitute a key step towards holonomic quantum computation @xcite . even within a single topologically trivial band </S>",
    "<S> , the possibility of preparing a bec or fermi - sea at finite quasimomentum should enable the observation of transient hall responses due to local berry curvature and , combined with the possibility of performing quantum quenches and the control of interactions , is expected to lead to novel many - body phenomena @xcite . </S>",
