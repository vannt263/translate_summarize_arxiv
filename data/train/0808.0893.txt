    "lately , the infrared behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagator in @xmath1 yang - mills theories has been exhaustively investigated by many research groups .",
    "the low energy behavior of these propagators are of great interest as they might provide helpful information on various aspects of color confinement , which is still far from being understood .",
    "previous results on the gluon and ghost propagators in the landau gauge have reported an enhanced behavior for the ghost and a suppressed gluon propagator vanishing at zero momentum .",
    "this behavior was supported by both numerical simulations @xcite and analytical studies @xcite . +   + nevertheless , recent lattice data on bigger volumes point towards a ghost propagator which is no longer enhanced and a gluon propagator which attains a finite value at zero momentum @xcite . recently , several analytical approaches @xcite have been worked out , being in agreement with these new data .",
    "+ among these approaches , we have settled for a framework within the gribov - zwanziger approach , successfully employed in the study of the propagators in @xmath2 @xcite in the landau gauge , which is defined as @xmath3 .",
    "we recall here that this condition does not uniquely fix the gauge freedom , as there can be configurations @xmath4 , gauge equivalent to @xmath5 , which also fulfill @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the gribov - zwanziger action allows for a ( partial ) resolution of this problem of gauge ( gribov ) copies in a local and renormalizable setting @xcite .",
    "+ our refined framework was constructed as follows .",
    "we have added two extra terms to the ordinary gribov - zwanziger action , without destroying the renormalizability of the action .",
    "let us already recall here that these additional terms precisely correspond to extra , yet unexplored , dynamical effects associated with the gribov - zwanziger action @xcite .",
    "the first extra term corresponded to the introduction of a novel mass operator , while the second term represented an additional vacuum energy term which was required in order to remain within the gribov region @xmath7 .",
    "this region is defined as the set of field configurations fulfilling the landau gauge condition , @xmath8 , and for which the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath9 is strictly positive , namely @xmath10 this region is bounded by the horizon , @xmath11 , where the first vanishing eigenvalue of @xmath12 appears .",
    "doing so , a large number of gauge copies is already excluded , as their appearance is precisely related to the existence of zero modes for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only worked out the 4-dimensional case .",
    "the implementation of the gribov - zwanziger approach in @xmath13 has not yet been carried out .",
    "the @xmath13 case is also conceptually different from the @xmath2 case due to the superrenormalizability , and there is no running of the coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "hence , it is useful to study the @xmath13 case in detail and make a comparison with the @xmath2 case as well as with the available @xmath13 lattice data .",
    "+ also in lattice simulations , one has to deal with the existence of gauge copies in the landau gauge when studying the propagators .",
    "the landau gauge is numerically implemented by minimizing the functional @xmath15 over its gauge orbit .",
    "notice that the gribov region @xmath7 corresponds in fact to the set of all relative minima of @xmath15 .",
    "an ideal implementation of the landau gauge would correspond to finding the absolute minima of that functional . even numerically",
    ", this is an extremely hard task to achieve , let stand alone to do it in the continuum formulation .",
    "nevertheless , the gauge field configurations employed in the numerical evaluation correspond to relative minima of the functional @xmath15 , so that they belong to the region @xmath7 .",
    "let us also mention that , at present , it is unknown how to restrict in the continuum the path integration to gauge fields corresponding to absolute minima of @xmath15 .",
    "that set of absolute minima forms a subset of the gribov region @xmath7 , known as the fundamental modular region @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this means that @xmath7 itself is still plagued by additional gauge copies @xcite . albeit it has been argued in @xcite that these additional copies should not contribute to the correlation functions , so that there should be no difference between the regions @xmath7 and @xmath16",
    ", we point out that the restriction to @xmath7 via the local and renormalizable gribov - zwanziger approach is the best one can do for now in the continuum . summarizing ,",
    "both in the lattice and continuum study of the gauge theory , one is looking at the same objects , e.g. gluon and ghost propagator ( see appendix c and section v ) , in such a way that the issue of gauge copies has been at least partially handled .",
    "we refer to e.g. @xcite for lattice works .",
    "+ for the benefit of the reader , we review the original construction of the gribov - zwanziger action in section ii .",
    "section iii presents a detailed motivation of why we should include effects of a mass term like @xmath18 to the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath19 .",
    "also , the renormalizability of @xmath20 is discussed .",
    "the requirement of renormalizability / consistency with the symmetries of the model puts rather severe restrictions on the possible additional operators which can be introduced in the theory .",
    "we also provide some details on the breaking of the brst symmetry . in section",
    "iv we discuss the need of the inclusion of an extra vacuum term @xmath21 .",
    "again , we prove the renormalizability of the total action @xmath22 . in section",
    "v , we investigate in detail the gluon and ghost propagator and already show that for @xmath23 , the ghost propagator is not enhanced and the gluon propagator is finite at zero momentum , in accordance with the lattice data of @xcite .",
    "in section vi a variational technique is scrutinized in order to determine the value of @xmath24 .",
    "this mass parameter @xmath24 is thus not added by hand to the original gribov - zwanziger action , but is determined in a self - consistent way . using this variational technique",
    ", we shall also investigate the one loop ghost propagator in the full momentum range .",
    "finally , our conclusion is given in section vii .",
    "we summarize the construction of the gribov - zwanziger action in @xmath25 dimensions , where it is understood that we actually work in dimensional regularization , with @xmath26 .",
    "we start from the following action @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the classical yang - mills action and @xmath29 denotes the landau gauge fixing and the ghost part .",
    "the part of expression proportional to the gribov mass parameter @xmath30 is the nonlocal horizon function , which implements the restriction to the first gribov region , with the proviso that this @xmath30 is not free , but subject to the horizon condition @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the so called horizon function @xmath33 this nonlocal horizon function has also received attention from the lattice community , see for example @xcite , where a lattice formulation of the horizon function can be found . + in order to find a manageable local quantum field theory , one adds extra fields @xmath34 to localize the nonlocal part of the action . doing so , the gribov - zwanziger action becomes @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 whereby @xmath37 are a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields , whereas @xmath38 are anticommuting ghost field .",
    "based on a global @xmath39 symmetry , @xmath40 , with respect to the composite index @xmath41 of the additional fields @xmath42 , we have introduced a more convenient notation @xmath43 .",
    "notice that for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "defining the quantum effective action @xmath47 by means of @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a shorthand for all the fields , then it is easily shown that the horizon condition is in fact equivalent with the requirement that @xmath50 is fulfilled for @xmath51 , or @xmath52 this means that @xmath30 will become fixed in terms of the natural scale of the theory which , in @xmath13 , is provided by the coupling itself .",
    "we thus expect to find @xmath53 .",
    "+ as it has been shown in @xcite , the action is renormalizable to all orders , and is thus suitable for quantum computations .",
    "as carried out in the 4-dimensional case @xcite , we introduce the local composite operator ( lco ) @xmath54 into the action .",
    "we shall couple this mass term to the action using a source @xmath55 , and for renormalization purposes , we have to add this term in a brst invariant way .",
    "therefore , we shall see that the @xmath56-sector must gain the same mass .",
    "hence , we consider the following action : @xmath57    \\ ; , \\label{s3eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 the original gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "the new source @xmath55 has the dimension of a mass squared .",
    "therefore , we shall often use the notation @xmath59 .",
    "let us briefly repeat the motivation for adding an extra term to the gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the fields @xmath60 introduced to localize the horizon function appearing in are interacting fields corresponding in fact to the nonlocal dynamics associated with the horizon function .",
    "therefore , these fields will develop their own quantum dynamics .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the @xmath61- and @xmath62- fields are intimately entangled , since there is a quadratic @xmath63-mixing term present in the tree level action , namely @xmath64 .",
    "hence , we expect that any effect in the @xmath62-sector will immediately reflect in the gluon sector , altering , in particular , the behavior of the gluon propagator at zero momentum .",
    "this is nothing else than saying that the horizon strongly influences the gluon dynamics .",
    "+ on top of the previous argument , we can give a second argument why one should add the local composite operator ( lco ) @xmath65 to the action .",
    "the horizon condition corresponds to @xmath66 i.e. to a condensate proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "one might then also expect that @xmath68 will be nonvanishing too when @xmath51 .",
    "hence , one is almost obliged to incorporate the effects related to the operator @xmath69 . to make this argument more explicit ,",
    "let us compute the _ perturbative _ value of the condensate @xmath70 .",
    "we start from @xmath71 with @xmath72 the generating functional defined in our case as @xmath73 { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-s'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and with @xmath74 the extended gribov - zwanziger action given in . at lowest order",
    ", one finds @xmath75 making use of @xmath76 with @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and after employing a standard integral in dimensional regularization , @xmath79 we find the following ultraviolet _ finite _",
    "result @xmath80 using this explicit expression , we can easily obtain the perturbative value of the condensate , reading @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the nonzero solution of @xmath83 . since at one loop @xmath84 we find that @xmath85 with @xmath86 we notice that the one loop vacuum energy corresponding to the gribov - zwanziger action is _",
    "positive_. the same feature was also observed in the one loop @xmath2 case @xcite .",
    "+ besides this perturbative value of the condensate , it could also be possible that another , non - perturbative , value emerges .",
    "however , to calculate this non - perturbative value , one should calculate the legendre transformation of the generating functional @xmath72 to obtain the effective action @xmath87 , where the absolute minimum configuration @xmath88 would correspond to the true , energetically favoured , vacuum . here , we limit ourselves to observe that , similar to what was encountered in @xmath2 , @xcite , no such value has been found at one loop , meaning that higher order contributions have to be taken into account . for the interested reader ,",
    "we have written down the corresponding details in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "+      to prove the renormalizability , let us start from the following action , @xmath89 with @xmath74 the action proposed in , and with the lco parameter @xmath90 a new dimensionless quantity .",
    "this term in @xmath90 is , in principle , needed to take into account potential divergences proportional to @xmath91 , which are allowed by power counting and by the symmetries of the action .",
    "this term would ensure multiplicative renormalizability of the functional @xmath72 .",
    "however , although this term can not be ruled out at the level of the algebraic analysis , an analogous proof as in @xmath2 can be written down allowing us to consistently set @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "+ to study the renormalizability of the gribov - zwanziger action , it is highly useful to embed it in an extended action , which reduces to the original model in a specific limit @xcite . doing so , we may have a larger number of ward identities at our disposal , which are powerful tools to construct the most general possible counterterm .",
    "therefore , proceeding as in the @xmath2 case @xcite , we shall start with the following action @xmath93 with @xmath94 given in , @xmath95 in , and @xmath96 we introduced new sources @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which are necessary to analyze the renormalization of the corresponding composite field operators in a brst invariant fashion .",
    "the brst operator @xmath103 is defined through @xmath104 so that @xmath103 is nilpotent , @xmath105 .",
    "one can easily see that the action @xmath106 is indeed brst invariant , @xmath107 .",
    "we underline that the mass operator itself , @xmath69 , is also brst invariant . in table",
    "i , we have summarized for all the fields and sources their mass dimension , ghost number and @xmath108-charge , which is defined by means of the diagonal generator @xmath109 of the global @xmath39 symmetry .",

    "we subsequently solved the gap equation ( horizon condition ) @xmath195 ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) numerically in the case @xmath196 , and we found @xmath197 which is also consistent with the analytical result .",
    "the corresponding vacuum energy is given by @xmath198 again equivalent with .",
    "+ the gap equation derived from the effective action @xmath199 should of course give back this perturbative solution , next to a potential nonperturbative solution , which can never be discovered by simply using . the whole point of the inversion ( legendre transformation ) is just that there might be multiple solutions to the equation @xmath169 , next to the perturbative one . in our case , the situation is interesting because there is already a nontrivial scale in the game , namely the gribov mass @xmath82 .",
    "this allows us to obtain a nonvanishing value for the condensate already at the perturbative level .",
    "the action exhibits several ward identities which we have enlisted below .    * the global @xmath39 invariance : @xmath200 *",
    "the slavnov - taylor identity : @xmath201 @xmath202 * the landau gauge condition and the antighost equation : @xmath203 * the ghost ward identity : @xmath204 notice that @xmath205 is a classical breaking , since it is linear in the quantum fields . * the linearly broken local constraints : @xmath206 * the exact @xmath207 symmetry : @xmath208    we shall now rely on the algebraic renormalization procedure @xcite , according to which the most general allowed invariant counterterm @xmath209 is an integrated local polynomial in the fields and sources with dimension bounded by three , with vanishing ghost number and @xmath210-charge , and subject to the following constraints : @xmath211 the operator @xmath212 is the nilpotent linearized slavnov - taylor operator ,",
    "@xmath213 one can show that @xmath209 does not depend on the lagrange multiplier @xmath214 , and that the antighost @xmath215 and the @xmath216-valued fields @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 can only enter through the combinations @xcite @xmath221 imposing the previous constraints arising from the ward identities , the most general counterterm can be brought in the following compact form @xmath222 with @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 three arbitrary parameters .",
    "it is an impressive feature of the action @xmath106 that only 3 independent parameters can enter the counterterm , despite the presence of many fields and sources .",
    "as the most general counterterm @xmath209 compatible with the ward identities has now been constructed , it still remains to be checked whether the starting action @xmath226 is stable , i.e. that @xmath209 can be reabsorbed into @xmath106 through a renormalization of the parameters , fields and sources appearing in @xmath226 .",
    "+ according to expression ( [ counterterm ] ) , @xmath209 contains three parameters @xmath223,@xmath224 and @xmath225 , which correspond to a multiplicative renormalization of the gauge coupling constant @xmath227 , the parameter @xmath228 , the fields @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath215 , @xmath214 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath219 , @xmath233 and the sources @xmath234 , @xmath102 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath98 , @xmath237 , according to @xmath238 this is possible , provided that we define the bare quantities in terms of the renormalized quantities as @xmath239 with @xmath240 these are the only independent renormalization constants . for the rest of the fields",
    ", we have @xmath241 while for the renormalization of the sources @xmath242 @xmath243 we see thus that the lco @xmath69 does not renormalize independently , as it is evident from .",
    "the only new parameter entering the game corresponds to the renormalization of the vacuum functional , expressed by @xmath90 and its renormalization factor @xmath244 . as discussed in the main body of this paper , this parameter turns out to be equal to zero anyhow .",
    "for the benefit of the reader , in this appendix we discuss how our results compare with the corresponding lattice data in the case of the gluon propagator .",
    "the quantity which is evaluated in both cases is the gluon propagator , namely the connected gluon two - point function @xmath245 , where the gauge field configurations @xmath246 are restricted to the gribov region @xmath7 .",
    "we shall also show that the gluon and the ghost propagators are color diagonal .      in the continuum formulation ,",
    "the gluon propagator is given by the connected gluon two - point function , and expressible by means of @xmath247 with @xmath248 the generating functional of the connected gluon @xmath249-point functions , which in our case will read @xmath250 { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\left(s_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{tot } } } } + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x \\left(j^a_\\mu a^a_\\mu+j_{\\varphi , \\mu}^{ab } \\varphi_\\mu^{ab } + j_{\\overline{\\varphi } , \\mu}^{ab}\\overline{\\varphi}_\\mu^{ab}\\right)\\right)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath251 is the improved gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "this amounts to considering the landau gauge fixing , such that the relevant gluon configurations belong to the gribov region , i.e. these are ( local ) minima of @xmath252 along the gauge orbit .",
    "+   + as proven in @xcite , the gluon propagator is transverse . in a condensed notation ,",
    "one shall find @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the matrix propagator , as written down in up to first order .",
    "the upper left corner of this matrix @xmath254 corresponds precisely to the gluon propagator , as it is apparent by taking the second derivative with respect to the source @xmath255 .",
    "+   + if one is interested in the 1pi two - point functions , one should look at the corresponding generator , which is the effective action @xmath256 $ ] . as is well known",
    ", the corresponding 1pi two - point function will be the inverse of the connected two - point function ( or propagator ) .",
    "said otherwise , the corresponding matrices will be each others inverse .",
    "this is also explained in the main body of the text , with the 1pi two - point function matrix written down in , again up to first order .",
    "+   + as we have already stressed earlier in the paper , the extra fields @xmath34 are introduced in order to obtain a local manageable field theory , which is capable of restricting the gauge field configurations to the gribov region , which is a rather nontrivial operation in the continuum . in principle",
    ", one could opt to work in an effective field theory fashion by again integrating out the extra fields . clearly , this will give rise to a very complicated ( nonlocal ) action , written solely in terms of the original yang - mills fields . in this formulation , the gluon propagator is directly related to the inverse of the 1pi two - point function , due to the absence of mixing .",
    "anyhow , the result for the propagator itself will be the same as the one already obtained before in the preferable local and manifestly renormalizable formulation with the extra fields , when looking at the same order in @xmath14 .",
    "this can be easily checked at tree level : integrating out the auxiliary fields in leads to the following quadratic ( nonlocal ) effective action , @xmath257\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the limit @xmath258 is understood in order to recover the landau gauge , and where we skipped the irrelevant constant terms .",
    "the tree level gluon propagator in momentum space is in this case @xmath259 , with @xmath260 the quadratic form appearing in , when expressed in momentum space .",
    "clearly , this leads back to the lowest order approximation in the upper left corner of .",
    "+   + concerning the ghost propagator , a similar formalism applies .",
    "+   + let us discuss the issue of color diagonality .",
    "the global color symmetry guarantees us that the gluon and the ghost propagators are color diagonal .",
    "this property is encoded in the global @xmath1 ward identity , which reads at the classical level @xmath261 with @xmath106 the classical action and @xmath262 all the other fields . in particular , @xmath263 and",
    "similar relations for the other fields @xmath262 .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath264 this identity can be upgraded to the quantum level , @xmath265 with @xmath47 the generator of 1pi correlators . performing the legendre transformation leads to the analogous ward identity for the generator @xmath266 of connected correlators , @xmath267 we shall concentrate on the gluon sector ,",
    "so we have already set all other sources equal to zero .",
    "taking a derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath268 leads to @xmath269 next , taking a derivative w.r.t . @xmath270 and setting @xmath169 at the end gives the following relationship , @xmath271 or equivalently @xmath272 this relation expresses nothing else than that the gluon propagator is an @xmath1 invariant rank two tensor .",
    "therefore , @xmath273 since @xmath274 is the unique invariant rank two tensor .",
    "+   + obviously , all available explicit loop results obtained with the ( modified ) gribov - zwanziger action are compatible with the general proof .",
    "notice also that the proof is the same as the one we would use in the case of normal @xmath1 gauge theories .",
    "+   + an analogous result can be derived for the ghost propagator .      in a lattice formulation ,",
    "one also calculates the connected two - point function , by taking the monte carlo average of the discrete version of the operator @xmath275 .",
    "the statistical weight for this simulation is given by the exponential of the discretized version of the yang - mills gauge action , e.g. the wilson action .",
    "the landau gauge fixing is numerically implemented by minimizing a suitable functional along the gauge orbits , which corresponds to minimizing @xmath276 in the continuum . as we have already explained in the introduction , this amounts to numerically selecting a gauge configuration within the gribov region , equivalent with what we did in the continuum .",
    "we refer the interested reader to section 2 of @xcite for the explicit expressions of the discrete action , gauge fields and minimizing functional .",
    "in particular , we refer to subsection 2.4 in which the continuum and lattice versions of the gluon propagator are written down .",
    "the lattice gluon propagator also turns out to be transverse .",
    "moreover , both the gluon and ghost propagator are found to be color diagonal .",
