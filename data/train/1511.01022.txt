    "in the hierarchical model of structure formation , galaxy clusters form through the merging of smaller substructures .",
    "a fraction of the energy dissipated during these merging events can be channelled into the amplification of magnetic fields and acceleration of relativistic particles ( see brunetti & jones 2014 for a review on the topic ) .",
    "giant radio halos ( rhs ) are potential probes of this process . they are mpc - scale diffuse radio sources with steep spectrum and low surface brightness that are found in the central regions of a number of galaxy clusters ( see feretti et al .",
    "2012 for a recent observational review ) . in this respect clusters",
    "are crossroads between cosmology and plasma astrophysics .",
    "giant rhs have no obvious optical counterpart , and rather show a remarkable connection with the intracluster medium : their extent and morphology are closely related to the thermal bremsstrahlung x  ray emission .",
    "one recent observational milestone , based on the extended gmrt radio halo cluster survey ( egrhs , venturi et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , kale et al . 2013 , 2015 ) and complemented with results from the literature , is that rhs are hosted in only @xmath7  2030% of x  ray luminous clusters ( @xmath8 erg  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , clusters branch into two populations in the @xmath9 plane : they either host a rh whose radio power shows a tight correlation with the cluster x  ray luminosity @xmath10 , or are `` radio  quiet '' , with upper limits to the radio power of the undetected rh well below the correlation ( brunetti et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "remarkably , there is a tight connection between these rhs and cluster mergers ( cassano et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) : a detailed and quantitative radio / x  ray analysis of the clusters in the egrhs shows that giant radio halos are found only in dynamically interacting ( merging ) systems , whereas relaxed clusters do not produce diffuse emission on the mpc - scale at the sensitivity level of current observations .",
    "the recent advent of cluster surveys through the detection of the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( e.g. with the planck satellite ) has allowed the study of the @xmath2@xmath3 is the total cluster mass within the radius @xmath11 , defined as the radius corresponding to a total density contrast @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the critical density of the universe at the cluster redshift . ]",
    "correlation ( basu et al . 2012 , cassano et al . 2013 ) , which shows that massive ( @xmath14 m@xmath15 ) clusters have a bimodal behaviour also in the radio  sz diagram .    the commonly adopted scenario to explain the origin of rhs and their connection with mergers is based on the ( re)acceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated during clusters mergers ( i.e. , brunetti & jones 2014 ) .",
    "according to this scenario the formation and evolution of rhs depends on the cluster merging rate at the different cosmic epochs and on the mass of the hosting clusters , which ultimately sets the energy budget that can be dissipated and drained in the relativistic particles and magnetic fields .",
    "one of the key expectations is that giant rhs should be found in massive / energetic merger events , and become rarer in less massive clusters and eventually absent in relaxed systems ( cassano & brunetti 2005 ) .",
    "+ in line with this scenario , cuciti et al .",
    "( 2015 ) recently found some evidences for an increasing occurrence of radio halos with the cluster mass .",
    "however , present statistical studies are essentially limited to very x - ray luminous ( @xmath16 } > 5 \\times 10^{44}$ ]  erg  s@xmath5 ) and massive ( @xmath17 ) galaxy clusters .",
    "extending these constraints both in redshift and to lower cluster masses is vital to understand the origin of cluster - scale radio emission and to test the predictions of theoretical models .",
    "however , this means to explore the faint end of the correlation between cluster mass ( or x  ray luminosity ) and radio power , which is challenging from an observational point of view as rhs are expected to become progressively fainter in less massive systems .    a new opportunity is offered by the improved imaging sensitivity and sampling of angular scales of the new generation of radio interferometers . in particular , the precursors of the square kilometre array ( ska ) such as askap and meerkat in the ghz regime and lofar ( van haarlem et al .",
    "2013 ) and mwa ( tingay et al . 2013 ) at frequencies below 300  mhz , allow to extend earlier studies to a preliminary exploration of low mass nearby clusters .    here",
    "we present the result of a pilot observational study carried out with the 7-antenna karoo array telescope ( kat7 ) designed to extend our knowledge of the occurrence of rhs in galaxy clusters to a mass  limited sample ( @xmath18 m@xmath15 ) of nearby clusters in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sample ] we present the sample of galaxy clusters selected for this study ; in section 3 we describe the observations and the data reduction ; in section 4 we discuss the @xmath19 ",

    "in order to complement the results based on the egrhs , and to increase the information on the presence of diffuse radio emission ( in the form of giant rhs ) to lower mass clusters in the nearby universe , we selected all the galaxy clusters from the planck sz cluster catalogue ( planck collaboration , 2014 ) with the following criteria :    * mass , @xmath18 m@xmath15 ; * redshift range , @xmath21  arcmin at z  @xmath22 and @xmath23  arcmin at z  @xmath24 . ] ; * @xmath25 .",

    "based on the results of the injection simulations and the magnitude of the measured rh flux density , it is unlikely that a large fraction of its real flux density is missing in our observations .",

    ". for rxcj1407.8 - 5100 and rxcj2201.9 - 5956 the comparison between the kat7 and the sumss emission suggests that our 1.86  ghz radio images are most likely a blend of individual sources .",
    "for the remaining three clusters , i.e. a3266 , a3695 and a3911 , our limited angular resolution and the lack of adequate high resolution imaging do not allow an unambiguous classification .    for seven clusters in our sample we could set an upper limit to the presence of a giant rh , which we report on the @xmath108 correlation together with the flux density measured for the candidate rhs in psz1g018.75 + 23.57 and in the triangulum australis . as a85 was the only cluster with available halo information in the @xmath113  m@xmath15 , our data offer the first statistical information about cluster rhs in this mass range and",
    "confirm the lack of bright rhs in smaller systems , indicating that rhs more powerful than expected from the correlation must be rare . under the assumption that the @xmath108 correlation can be extended to smaller systems ,",
