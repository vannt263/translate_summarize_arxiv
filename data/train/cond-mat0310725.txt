    "modifications of vitrification properties of liquids under confinement are of interest for relevant technological and biophysical problems @xcite . while experiments show that the glass transition is not usually suppressed when the glass former is confined , changes in the temperature of the transition and in dynamical properties of liquids upon supercooling are induced by both the geometrical confinement and the interaction with the substrate  @xcite .    in the study of the glass transition phenomenology the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the evolution of glassy dynamics plays a fundamental role .",

    "these behaviors have been effectively found in experiments and simulations on supercooled liquids in regions close to @xmath0 where hopping was negligible @xcite .",
    "the role of the cooperative dynamics of the particles in the glass transition is still under discussion and there is an increasing activity on the definition and observation of dynamical heterogeneities  @xcite .",

    "liquids confined in network of interconnected pores with a large value of porosity , as silica xerogels , can be appropriately studied with models where the confining solid is built as a disordered array of frozen microspheres  @xcite .",

    "a detailed study on the dynamics carried out in the direct space has shown two important differences with respect to the bulk upon supercooling  @xcite .",
