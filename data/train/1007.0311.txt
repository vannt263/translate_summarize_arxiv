    "the production and use of radioactive beams is a rapidly developing new field in nuclear physics .",
    "pioneering experiments are taking place , dedicated facilities are commissioned and new ones are planned .",
    "the primary aim of this research activity is the study of so - called exotic nuclei , that is , short - lived nuclei far removed from the line of stability because of an unusual ratio of numbers of neutrons @xmath9 over protons @xmath10 .",
    "parallel with the rapid developments of experimental techniques to observe exotic nuclei , there has been a surge in the interest in their theoretical description .",
    "the main motivation for these studies is the possibility that wide variations in @xmath11 may have a profound influence on shell structure , which constitutes the basis of our understanding of nuclei .",
    "there exist currently two standard theoretical approaches for the description of exotic nuclei , namely energy density functional theory  @xcite and the nuclear shell model  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the use of a third approach , namely the interacting boson model ( ibm ) of arima and iachello  @xcite , to predict properties of exotic nuclei .",
    "the ibm is a semi - microscopic model of nuclei , positioned intermediately between single - particle and collective models .",
    "the model contains a vibrational and a rotational limit ( as well as one which can be considered as intermediate)which connects well with the phenomenology of nuclei  and can be brought into relation with the nuclear shell model . in the original version of the ibm , applicable to",
    "even  even nuclei , the basic building blocks are @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons with angular momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons can be interpreted as correlated cooper pairs formed by two nucleons in the valence shell coupled to angular momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this interpretation constitutes the basis of the connection between the ibm and the nuclear shell model , and leads in a natural way to a version of the model where a distinction is made between neutron and proton bosons , the so - called  @xcite .    if one restricts oneself to configurations that are symmetric in the neutron and proton bosons , the simplest version of the model arises , known as  .",
    "the standard hamiltonian has 1 single - particle energy and 5 two - body interactions if only relative ( excitation ) energies are considered , increasing to @xmath16 if absolute binding energies are included in the analysis .",
    "these coefficients enter as free parameters in the model and must be adjusted to the data .",
    "however , because of the connection with the nuclear shell model , the dependence of the energies and interactions on the number of valence neutrons and protons is known qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "the long - term aim of this work is to develop a systematic parametrization ( that is , to determine the functional dependence of the various coefficients on the number of valence neutrons and protons ) for entire regions of nuclei , and to do so on the basis of a fit to the data , guided by microscopic arguments .",
    "once the appropriate functional dependence has been determined , it will be possible to make spectroscopic predictions by extrapolation to unknown regions of nuclei .",
    "the predictive power of this procedure will depend crucially on the counting of the valence nucleons and hence on the shell structure of nuclei and its evolution in exotic regions .",
    "the idea to use the ibm to extrapolate from known to unknown regions of the nuclear chart is not new .",
    "in fact , in the late 1970s and early 1980s , long before any talk of exotic nuclei , this technique was applied on many _",
    "series in the context of the . for a review of the literature ,",
    "see iachello and arima  @xcite . occasionally also _",
    "isotone _ series have been considered  @xcite and recently also a combination of _ isobars _ and _ isotones _",
    ". however , to our knowledge a comprehensive and systematic description with the ibm of entire _ regions _ of nuclei has not yet been tried .",
    "the closest related study is due to casten _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who elaborated a multi - nucleus parametrization based on the @xmath17 scheme  @xcite .",
    "our intention is to develop this idea further with more refined hamiltonians that better reproduce observed nuclear properties .",
    "we also mention that our investigation has similar aims as those of the recent work of the tokyo group  @xcite , ( _ i.e. _ , the use of the ibm in the description of exotic nuclei ) ; in the latter studies the connection of the ibm with mean - field models is exploited to arrive at a suitable parametrization while here the long - term aim is to draw inspiration from its connection with the shell model .    in this paper",
    "we present a first calculation of this type and apply the to an entire region of the nuclear mass chart , namely the even  even zr , mo , ru and pd nuclei with @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ s_param ] gives a description of the parametrization of the hamiltonian used .",
    "the application to the @xmath0 region is discussed in section  [ s_appli ] .",
    "in the final section  [ s_conc ] the conclusions and outlook are presented .",
    "preliminary versions of this work were presented in references  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian used in this paper is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the boson - number , pairing , angular momentum and quadrupole operators , defined as @xmath23^{(0)}_0 , % = \\sum_\\mu d^\\dag_\\mu d_\\mu , \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat p_+&=&[s^\\dag\\times s^\\dag+\\sqrt{5}\\,d^\\dag\\times d^\\dag]^{(0)}_0 , \\qquad \\hat p_-=\\left(\\hat p_+\\right)^\\dag , \\nonumber\\\\",

    "if one is interested in the properties of a single nucleus , this is a possible form of the most general hamiltonian with the advantage that the first four terms have been used extensively in phenomenological fits to nuclear spectra  @xcite .",
    "the last term @xmath30 gives rise to a so - called ` @xmath31-compression ' which increases the moment of inertia with increasing angular momentum ( or with increasing @xmath13-boson seniority @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to measured energy spectra , also electric quadrupole transition rates are considered in the fit .",
    "these are calculated in using the e2 operator @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective charge of a boson and with a quadrupole operator which is consistent with the one used in the hamiltonian , following the consistent-@xmath34 formalism ( cqf )  @xcite .",
    "although reasonable results are obtained with a constant hamiltonian , they are considerably improved if parameters are allowed to vary with the number of nucleons in the valence shell , as suggested by the shell - model interpretation of the .",
    "we propose here a dependence of the generic form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a parameter of the hamiltonian , that is , @xmath37 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , and @xmath38 is the fractional filling of the neutron ( @xmath39 ) or the proton ( @xmath40 ) valence shell , that is , @xmath41 with @xmath42 the number of valence neutrons or protons and @xmath43 the size of the corresponding valence shell .",
    "note that in the parametrization  ( [ e_param ] ) neutrons and protons are always counted as particles and never as holes . while microscopic arguments suggest a dependence on @xmath44 rather than on @xmath38 ( where @xmath45 is the number of particles or holes , whichever is smaller counted from the nearest closed shell ) , the latter parametrization has the drawback of yielding spectra that are symmetric around mid - shell .",
    "since this particle  hole symmetry is broken in the nuclei considered here , especially in the pd isotopes , we prefer the parametrization  ( [ e_param ] ) .",
    "in the present application to the @xmath0 region a linear dependence on the fractional fillings is assumed for the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 while @xmath24 and @xmath27 are kept constant .",
    "first , energy levels in the known nuclei @xmath46zr , @xmath47mo , @xmath48ru and @xmath49pd are selected and fitted with the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) by minimizing the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation . in this first step",
    "an initial choice is made for @xmath29 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fitted to the energy spectra of all nuclei considered in the fit with no dependence on the number of neutrons or protons .",
    "next , the linear dependence on the fractional filling of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 is determined again by minimizing the rms deviation .",
    "the minimization in this case involves 11 parameters , three for each coefficient in the hamiltonian with a fractional - filling dependence together with @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "once the wave functions of all states have been determined in this unified fit , the e2 transition rates are fitted by adjusting the value of the boson effective charge @xmath33 but keeping to the same value of @xmath29 . since @xmath50(e2 ) properties depend rather strongly on @xmath29 , it is at this point that it can established whether its value is appropriate or not .",
    "the entire procedure is repeated for a new value of @xmath29 , until a reasonable compromise is found between the results of the energy and e2 fits .",

    "the rms deviations in the energies and @xmath50(e2 ) values are quantified with following definitions : @xmath64 where the sums are over the available data points , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in number , respectively .",
    "note that the first rms deviation for the e2 data , @xmath60 , is rather insensitive to small e2 transitions while @xmath63 probably assigns too much weight to them .",
    "the rms deviations vary rather weakly except for small values of @xmath29 , but both energies and e2 transitions are optimized for @xmath67 .",

    "the character of the minimum corresponding to the parameters of table  [ t_param ] has been checked by choosing different starting values for the @xmath88 and @xmath89 parameters , leading always to final parameter sets that are close to the one shown , within numerical errors . while this is not a proof of the global character of the minimum , it is a good indication of it .",

    "is observed at 1751  kev while it is calculated at @xmath101  kev .",
    "these differences are indicative of the closure of the @xmath102 shell at @xmath3 , resulting in a nearly doubly - magic behaviour of @xmath100zr .",
    "these considerations can be made quantitative by including the ground - state bands of some of the lighter zr isotopes in the energy fit . as illustrated in table  [ t_zr ]",
    "even the inclusion of just one isotope , @xmath103zr , yields a dramatic increase in the rms deviation of the fit to the entire region .",
    "effects of @xmath102 shell persist in @xmath104zr which exhibits a low - lying @xmath105 band at 331  kev .",
    "this clearly can not be the collective first - excited @xmath105 band of the and therefore the band is not included in the fit .",

    "the inclusion of _ all _ zr isotopes in a successful fit would necessarily require a refined parametrization that takes account of the @xmath3 closure .",
    "however , even at the present level of approximation , we believe to have illustrated with this example that the unified fits of the type used here are sensitive to nuclear shell effects .",
    "this feature could be of use to detect precursor effects of shell closures in extrapolations toward unknown regions of the nuclear chart .    in the present application excluding zr isotopes with @xmath107",
    ", we arrive at a description of 335 collective levels in 31 nuclei with a rms deviation from the observed level energies of 120  kev .",
    "the most notable systematic discrepancies are found for ( i ) the spectra of @xmath108 mo isotopes due to some remnant effect of the @xmath3 closure , ( ii ) the energy of the @xmath91 band in @xmath109zr which is predicted lower than it is observed , and ( iii ) some mid - shell nuclei like @xmath104ru and @xmath109pd which behave less collectively than predicted by systematics .",
    "on the basis of the parametrization thus established it is now possible to make predictions for more exotic nuclei for which up to now no spectroscopic information is available .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ f_enzrmo ] and [ f_enrupd ] where systematically the predictions for the next ( unknown ) even  even isotopes are shown , that is , for @xmath5zr , @xmath6mo , @xmath7ru and @xmath8pd .",

    "these are a measure of the collective behaviour of the nucleus and our calculation generally follows the observed trends . a glaring exception to this overall agreement is the @xmath112 transition in the zr isotopes with @xmath107 where the observed @xmath50(e2 ) value is only fraction from what is expected from systematics .",
    "this again is due to the neglect in the calculation of the @xmath102 closure at @xmath3 .",

    "the classical limit of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) is @xmath134 where the coefficients @xmath135 are given by @xmath136 since the parameters in this potential depend on the fractional fillings of the valence shells , we arrive at a geometry for each nucleus which changes with neutron and proton numbers and which has been obtained in an unbiased and straightforward way from the observed excitation spectra .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ f_pes1 ] and  [ f_pes2 ] , where the potentials are shown for all nuclei included in the fit as well as for some which are predicted .",
    "for the sake of a correct interpretation of these potential surfaces , we recall that @xmath91 is identical to the corresponding parameter in the bohr  mottelson geometric model  @xcite while @xmath92 is only proportional to it , the proportionality factor depending on the ratio of the valence over the total nucleon numbers  @xcite . the potential energy surface of the nucleus @xmath95ru has recently been calculated in variety of ways .",

    "@xcite showed that deviations from axial symmetry can be important and , in the specific case of @xmath95ru , obtained a potential energy surface with triaxial minimum . with the simple parametrization of the hamiltonian",
    "as proposed here which is limited to two - body interactions , no triaxial minimum can be obtained  @xcite , a result confirmed by the surfaces shown in figures  [ f_pes1 ] and  [ f_pes2 ] .",
    "it is also seen , however , that the specific potential for @xmath95ru is rather soft in @xmath91 .",
    "triaxial minima can be obtained when cubic terms are added to the hamiltonian  @xcite . in comparison with the results obtained in reference  @xcite for the nuclei @xmath137ru",
    ", we observe that the potential surfaces shown here show less variation with neutron number since they are derived from a global fit to many nuclei while in the former study the fits were carried out nucleus by nucleus . also shown in figures",
    "[ f_pes1 ] and  [ f_pes2 ] are the potential energy surfaces for the predicted neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , their geometry varies from strongly deformed in the neutron - rich zr isotopes to spherical in @xmath8pd .",
    "we have suggested in this paper the use of for global calculations of large regions of the nuclear chart and have illustrated the idea with an application to the @xmath0 region .",
    "the present work calls for several features to be studied in more detail .",
    "the first concerns the technical issue of finding the set of parameters that corresponds to the _ global _ minimum of the rms deviation .",
    "the minimization algorithm that has been used here is a straightforward linearization procedure of the eigenvalue problem associated with the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) which has no trouble in finding a _ local _ minimum .",
    "we have found no dependence of the converged parameters on various choices of their initial values but it would be of interest to confirm the global character of the minimum using a different algorithm which samples large parameter regions .",
    "secondly , the dependence of the parameters on the fractional fillings @xmath38 of the valence neutron and proton shells requires further study .",
    "we have proposed here a dependence on @xmath138 but other choices should be investigated as well , such as a dependence on @xmath139 ( where @xmath140 is the boson number ) or on casten s factor @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a possible dependence on subshells must also be studied . a proper treatment of these effects and their dependence on valence nucleon number must draw inspiration from the microscopic foundation of the ibm . for example , in this study we have taken a constant value of @xmath29 , the parameter appearing in the quadrupole operator .",
    "this is possibly a reasonable approximation for the restricted set of nuclei considered here but it will certainly be inadequate if large regions of the nuclear chart are fitted simultaneously .",
    "this inadequacy might be satisfactorily resolved by a proper estimate of this parameter based on the shell - model interpretation of the ibm .",
    "an alternative strategy is to adopt a functional dependence of @xmath29 on valence - particle number suggested by microscopy , containing a few parameters that are fitted to the data .",
    "finally , we point out that the type of calculation described here opens up the possibility for a simultaneous and global treatment of nuclear ground - state properties ( such as masses and radii ) in addition to the excited - state properties discussed in this paper .",
    "a possible strategy for merging the calculations of ground- and excited - state energies in the framework of the interacting boson model was outlined in reference  @xcite with preliminary results for even  even nuclei in the major shell with @xmath142 and @xmath143 but further investigations of this approach are required .",
