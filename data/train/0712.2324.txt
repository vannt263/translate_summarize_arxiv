    "myosin v is a two - headed processive motor protein from the myosin superfamily , involved in different forms of intracellular transport @xcite .",
    "it has drawn a lot of attention in recent years and is now one of the best studied motor proteins .",
    "the experiments have characterized it mechanically @xcite , biochemically @xcite , optically @xcite and structurally @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that myosin v walks along actin filaments in a hand - over - hand fashion @xcite with an average step size of about 35 nm , roughly corresponding to the periodicity of actin filaments @xcite , a stall force of around 2 pn @xcite and a run length of a few microns @xcite . under physiological conditions ,",
    "adp release has been identified as the time limiting step in the duty cycle @xcite .",
    "the arp2/3 complex @xcite initiates actin filament branching in the vicinity of a protruding edge of a cell .",
    "the complex consists of 7 subunits ( arp2 , arp3 and arpc1 through arpc5 ) and is activated by wasp / scar proteins @xcite .",
    "it binds to the side of one ( `` mother '' ) actin filament and initiates the nucleation of a second ( `` daughter '' filament ) , which starts growing with the fast growing end ( `` + '' end ) away from the arp2/3 complex . the mother and the daughter filament enclose an angle of @xmath0 .",
    "the question what happens to a myosin v motor when it arrives at an arp2/3 mediated actin filament junction is of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , the branching behavior is important for understanding vesicle transport in the actin cortex . and second , it is of high interest when studying the fundamental mechanism of myosin v stepping , because it represents a well defined situation in which predictions from different theoretical models can be tested against the experimental result .",
    "our aim in this article is to use the elastic lever arm model for myosin v , which is described in detail in a previous article @xcite , to predict the dynamics of a myosin v motor that passes over an arp2/3 junction . in particular",
    ", we will calculate the probabilities that a motor continues along the mother or the daughter filament .",
    "the idea behind the elastic lever arm model for myosin v is to describe the dimeric motor as an assembly of two identical heads , connected together and to the cargo - binding tail with elastic lever arms .",
    "the model allows us to derive the properties of a dimeric molecule , such as step size distribution , force - velocity relation and processivity , from the properties of an individual head , such as geometry , chemical kinetics and elasticity . in this respect",
    "the approach is different from the class of discrete stochastic models , which describe the motor as a single unit @xcite .",
    "we describe each head with a 5-state mechano - chemical model , similar to that for muscle myosin ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where each state ( with bound adp.pi , adp ( pre - powerstroke ) , adp ( post - powerstroke ) , without a nucleotide , detached ) is connected with a certain orientation of the lever arm , as determined with electron microscopy ( em ) @xcite .",
    "the lever arms are modeled as elastic beams , connected with a flexible joint . a recent",
    "study measuring fluctuations in the position of the free head @xcite has demonstrated that the lead head diffuses around the joint freely before binding to the next actin site , meaning that there is no detectable elastic energy cost connected with variation in the angle between the two lever arms .",
    "the very nature of protein flexibility , which mainly originates from the twisting of bonds between carbon atoms in the backbone , leads us to the conclusion that the joint is also fully flexible with regard to rotation of each lever arm along its axis .",
    "similar flexibility has also been observed in myosin ii @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the branching probability is simplified a lot if we make the following assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the binding of the lead head always leads to a step , which means that its unbinding is significantly slower than the step that follows in the regular cycle ( pi release ) .",
    "second , we assume that the probability for the lead head to bind to site @xmath1 if the trail head is bound to site @xmath2 is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath3 @xmath4 denotes the elastic energy of deformed lever arms when the trail head is in the post - powerstroke state , bound to site @xmath2 , and the lead head in the pre - powerstroke state to site @xmath1 . in the following , we will use the notation where the sites on the mother filament are marked with @xmath5 and those on the daughter filament with @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xmath7 denotes the conditional probability for the lead head to bind to site @xmath8 on the daughter filament if the trail head is bound to the site @xmath9 on the mother filament .",
    "we enumerate the actin subunits so that the central subunit under the arp2/3 complex on the mother filament has the index 0 .",
    "positive indices denote subunits towards the `` + '' end and negative towards the `` - '' end .",
    "subunits of the daughter filament are enumerated from 0 onwards .",
    "note that sites numbered -2 , 0 and 2 on the mother filament are not accessible for a myosin v head , because of steric hindrance with the arp2/3 complex .",
    "( branching angle ) , @xmath10 ( twist ) and @xmath11 ( distance from the first subunit to the center of the mother filament ) .",
    "( b ) the myosin v motor is consists of two heads , connected with lever arms , which we describe as elastic rods .",
    "the proximal end of each lever arm always leaves the head at a fixed angle @xmath12 , which depends on the nucleotide state of that head .",
    "the distal ends of both lever arms are connected with a fully flexible joint.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    .geometric parameters of the arp2/3 junction and a myosin v head .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      we start our analysis at the point where a head of an approaching myosin v first passes the subunit @xmath14 or binds to it .",
    "this way the initial state is definitely not influenced by the presence of the arp2/3 complex . by counting only the first accessed site in this interval , we avoid double - counting of events where the motor binds , for example , first to site -17 and then to -4 .",
    "we denote with @xmath15 the probability that once the first head has bound to any subunit in the interval @xmath16 , this has happened at subunit @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath15 can be calculated in a way that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] . the sites between -17 and -7",
    "can only be reached from outside the interval .",
    "therefore , whenever the motor binds to one of them , it becomes the first accessed site in this interval .",
    "the probability @xmath17 then equals the probability that the site @xmath2 ever gets accessed by the motor , which is @xmath18 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob0 ] ) . for @xmath19 and higher",
    "the situation becomes different .",
    "site -6 counts as the first site in this interval if the preceding step size is 13 or 15 subunits , but not if it is 11 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding probability is @xmath20 .",
    "the probability that the first site accessed in this interval is -5 , @xmath21 , has the same value . finally , the sites -4 and -3 will be the first accessed sites in the interval if they are following a 15 subunit step . therefore , their probabilities are @xmath22 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath17 are given in the second column of table [ tab : probs ] and shown in the top graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] .        as a next step",
    ", we will derive the probability distribution @xmath23 for the first accessed site in the interval @xmath24 .",
    "we choose this interval because ( m,-13 ) is the first site from which the motor can reach the daughter filament .",
    "this distribution can be obtained from @xmath15 by redistributing probabilities for sites between -17 and -14 according to the conditional probability for the next step @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] .",
    "the values of @xmath26 are given in the third and fourth column of table [ tab : probs ] .",
    "this distribution defines the state from which we will calculate the branching ratio at the arp2/3 junction in the following section .",
    "now we can calculate the conditional probabilities that the lead head binds to the daughter filament , if the trail head is bound to a mother filament subunit @xmath2 fulfilling @xmath24 .",
    "we denote this probability as @xmath27 .        figure  [ fig : gallery ] shows the most relevant dimer configurations with the trail head on mother filament sites between -15 and 6 and the lead head either on mother or on daughter filament . for each trail head position ,",
    "the conditional probability that the lead head binds to a certain site is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) with the index @xmath28 running over all accessible mother- as well as daughter - filament sites  corresponding to one row in fig .  [",
    "fig : gallery ] . generally speaking",
    ", the daughter filament can either be reached directly , in a one - step process such as ( m,-6)@xmath29(d,3 ) , or in a two - step process such as ( m,-9)@xmath29(m,4)@xmath29(d,8 ) .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : onevstwostep ] .",
    "the probability that a motor with the trail head bound to site ( m,@xmath2 ) eventually binds to the daughter filament is @xmath30 here the first term denotes one - step processes and the second term two - step processes , where the motor first binds to site @xmath31 on the mother filament and subsequently to site @xmath1 on daughter filament .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that the only significant terms are those with @xmath32 .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath33 for each trail head position is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : table ] .",
    "the graph shows separately the contributions of one- and two - step processes .     on the mother filament , @xmath33 ( black and hatched bars ) , as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sidebr0 ] ) .",
    "the black bars show the contribution of one - step processes , in which the lead head binds to a site on the daughter filament immediately .",
    "the hatched bars show the contribution of two - step processes in which the motor first binds to another site on the mother filament ( usually 4 ) and then in the second step to the daughter filament .",
    "the grey bars show the probability that the motor continues along the mother filament . ]      with these probabilities and weights @xmath23 we finally obtain the branching ratio for the daughter filament : @xmath34 if one head binds to the daughter filament , there is still some probability that the next head will bind back to the mother filament .",
    "one such example , with the trail head on the site ( d,1 ) , is shown in the last row in fig .",
    "[ fig : gallery ]",
    ". however , the contribution of such events to the total branching ratio is not significant .",
    "while the exact result calculated above does require to take into account all the individual configurations , its order of magnitude can also be understood with a simple `` handwaving '' argument , which goes as follows .",
    "roughly speaking , the approaching myosin v motor can either reach the arp2/3 complex on the opposite side of the actin filament , in which case it can not switch to the daughter filament , or on the same side , in which case the probability to switch to the daughter filament is about 1/2 .",
    "together , this gives a branching ratio of @xmath35 , not far from the exact result of @xmath36 .",
    "an experiment measuring ( among other quantities ) the branching ratio at arp2/3 mediated actin filament junctions was recently carried out by @xcite .",
    "the results are not directly comparable  in the experiment the actin filaments were attached to a glass surface so that some binding sites were not accessible for myosin v. however , because the blocked sites are different depending whether the side filament branches to the left or to the right , we expect that in statistical average , the calculated branching ratio still gives a good approximation . in the experiment 18% of the molecules",
    "dissociated , 20% continued on the daughter filament , and 62% on the mother filament .",
    "if we discount dissociation events , this means that the fraction that switched to the daughter filament was 24% .",
    "the statistical error of this figure is about @xmath37 ( the total number of events observed was 76 ) .",
    "therefore , the result can be considered in excellent agreement with the model calculation .",
    "note that our calculation only concerns stepping patterns and does not take into account kinetics .",
    "this has an important advantage that the result only depends on geometric and elastic parameters , but not on kinetic constants , some of which are still less well known @xcite .",
    "combining the present model with the full kinetic scheme could influence the predicted branching ratio as follows .",
    "first , the binding rate of the lead head can be different in the vicinity of the arp2/3 complex . and",
    "second , the adp release rate of the rear head can be influenced by intramolecular strain , possibly also by its lateral ( off - axis ) component , as observed by purcell and coworkers @xcite .",
    "both these effects do not have a direct influence on the branching ratio , but they might have an indirect one by influencing the dissociation probability . in the present calculation , events where the whole myosin v molecule dissociates from the actin filament are not taken into account",
    ". there is , however , evidence that the predominant dissociation path leads through detachment of a head in the adp state @xcite ",
    "these processes are denoted as pathway 2 in ref .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the termination rate increases if either the lead head is hindered in its search for a binding site , or the adp release in the trail head is slowed down . in our model",
    "( see elastic energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : gallery ] ) , the lead head binding rate is strongly reduced if the trail head is bound to site @xmath38 , it is also reduced somewhat if the trail head is bound to @xmath39 , while it is accelerated for trail head positions @xmath9 and @xmath40 . in total , dissociation can be accelerated by the presence of the arp2/3 junction in 2 out of @xmath41 cases . without going into quantitative details",
    ", one can conclude that the dissociation probability could theoretically increase by up to @xmath42 .",
    "the branching ratio for the daughter filament could then be somewhat smaller , because those trail head positions that have the higher branching ratio are also more likely to lead to dissociation .",
    "the effect caused by the strain - dependent adp release rate is more difficult to estimate , mainly because the exact influence of off - axis strain on the adp release is not yet known quantitatively .     on different model parameters .",
    "( a ) dependence on the lead head angle @xmath43 ( solid line , lower scale ) and trail head angle @xmath44 ( dashed line , upper scale ) .",
    "( b ) dependence on the lever arm stiffness ( bending modulus ) @xmath45 . in both diagrams ,",
    "the dot shows the value used in all other calculations throughout the article.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   on different model parameters .",
    "( a ) dependence on the lead head angle @xmath43 ( solid line , lower scale ) and trail head angle @xmath44 ( dashed line , upper scale ) .",
    "( b ) dependence on the lever arm stiffness ( bending modulus ) @xmath45 .",
    "in both diagrams , the dot shows the value used in all other calculations throughout the article.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to check the robustness of our result against uncertainties in model parameters , we calculated the variation of the branching ratio with several model parameters .",
    "note that these calculations were carried out numerically and took into account all relevant processes , including longer and shorter steps , as well as transitions not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gallery ] . data in fig .",
    "[ fig : varangle ] shows a variation of about @xmath46 if either the lead head or the trail head angle is modified by @xmath47 .",
    "the allowed variation of these two parameters that keeps the model consistent with the experimental result is therefore restricted , although parameter sets where both angles are increased or decreased simultaneously can not be excluded .",
    "the result is more robust against variations in the lever arm stiffness @xmath45 , where deviations do not exceed few percent if the value of @xmath45 is changed by a factor of 3 in either direction .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the calculated branching ratio adds support to the elastic lever arm model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the geometric parameters used there",
    ". however , we can not use it as a criterion to determine the lever arm stiffness , which is still not known precisely .",
    "another open question is to what extent the result can be reproduced with alternative models , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses a more complex model for the elasticity of the lever arm , with a soft longitudinal ( about @xmath48 of the value used there ) , but very stiff azimuthal component .",
    "the completely different class of `` hot spot '' models , which proposes that the position of the next binding site is determined by a propagating conformational change in the actin filament @xcite , on the other hand , seems less compatible with the finding , unless the conformational change could propagate through the arp2/3 complex as well .",
