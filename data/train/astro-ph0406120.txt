    "modern cosmological models based on the cold dark matter paradigm emphasize the importance of hierarchical structure formation on all scales ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "galaxies like the milky way form as part of a local over - density in the primordial matter distribution via the agglomeration of numerous smaller building blocks which independently develop into dwarf galaxies . by seeking the physical connections between local dwarf galaxies and the milky way we can therefore directly probe the formation and evolution of large galaxies , and in particular the extent to which merging with dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies could have affected the galaxy .",
    "proper motion surveys coupled with radial velocity and metallicity measures have been used to look for and analyse the correlations between the orbital characterstics of stars and their overall metallicity measures ( _ e.g. _ carney et al.1996 ; unavane , wyse , & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "together with the hipparcos bright star catalogue which contains parallaxes , proper motions and radial velocities ( perryman et al.1997 ) , this has enabled classification of galactic stars based on their kinematics alone and has identified groups of stars with , for example , disk or halo kinematics , significant retrograde motion and those on highly elliptical orbits .",
    "some studies have specifically targeted retrograde stars to compare their abundances to prograde stars ( _ e.g. _ stephens & boesgaard 2002 ; ivan et al.2003 ) , while others have used statistical analyses of the kinematics of thousands of such stars to discover comoving groups ; stars localized in dynamical phase space in the galactic halo , which are possible signatures of accretion events ( _ e.g. _ majewski et al.1996 ; helmi et al.1999 ; navarro et al.2004 ) .",
    "direct measurement of stellar abundances in galactic satellite dwarf galaxies is a fairly new field of study which developed with the advent of the 8 - 10 m class telescopes and efficient high resolution spectrographs .",
    "shetrone et al.(2001 , 2003 ) determined the elemental abundances of 36 red giants in seven dwarf galaxies and compared those to stars in the galaxy , but found very little to connect these systems ( also see tolstoy et al .",
    "2003 , fulbright 2002 , and stephens & boesgaard 2002 ) .",
    "stars in the dsph galaxies have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] values in the mean than similar metal - poor galactic halo stars , whereas the galactic disk stars have much higher metallicities",
    ". the chemical and kinematic analysis of 73 galactic stars by fulbright ( 2000 , 2002 ) made partial use of kinematic information , and partial use of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ) , to separate the halo stars from thin and thick disk stars , which were then compared to the ( then available ) averaged dsph stellar abundances .",
    "alternatively , stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) used kinematics alone to select 56 stars in various components of the galactic halo ( outer , intermediate , and high halo , and extreme retrograde stars ) , to compare each of these to the ( then available ) stellar abundances in the draco dsph galaxy .",
    "inspired by stephens & boesgaard s work and fulbright s work , we realized that it is now possible to compare the chemistry of _ purely kinematically selected stars _ in the galactic halo , as well as the thin and thick disks , and compare each of these components to our larger dataset of stellar abundances , now in seven different dsph galaxies .",
    "furthermore , our previously published dsph abundance comparisons did not contain many galactic reference stars within the metallicity range of the dsph stars themselves , suggesting it would be worthwhile revisiting this issue .    in this paper , we use published kinematics and abundance measures of galactic stars to update and improve the comparison between galactic stellar populations and the dsph stellar abundances .",
    "we make use of the kinematic measures to statistically classify stars by their membership of the following galactic components : halo , thick disk , thin disk , pronounced retrograde orbits and other high velocity stars . we have adjusted the mg and ca abundances for four stars in the scl dsph from geisler et al.(2004 ) to account for differences in their adopted oscillator strengths ( we raised their [ ca / h ] by + 0.05 , and lowered their [ mg / h ] by 0.18 ) .",
    "we have also followed the suggestion by shetrone ( 2004 ) , and homogenized the atomic data for spectral lines of y , ba , and eu to improve the data quality and abundance comparisons from different authors ( discussed in section  [ bay ] ) .",
    "we did not homogenize the datasets for other elements though , particularly since different analyses use a variety of different spectral lines , often with little or no overlap .",
    "superficial examinations do not reveal obvious offsets or inconsistencies in the datasets we have combined for this paper for most elements , though more detailed inspection is certainly warranted .",
    "the effect of combining the datasets is likely to result in a larger spread in the abundances ( and possibly abundance ratios ) of order 0.1 to 0.2 dex ; this is the typical offset between recent analyses ( discussed by shetrone 2004 ) , and is typical of the offsets in the abundance comparisons between different model atmosphere techniques and atomic databases ( examined by shetrone et al.2003 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to homogenenize the errors analyses for all elements from each of the galactic analyses though , and instead adopt representative uncertainties of @xmath7[fe / h ] = @xmath80.05 , @xmath7[_x_/(fe or h ) ] = @xmath80.10 , and @xmath7[_x_/_y _ ] = @xmath80.15 ( where _ x , y _ represent any element or combination of elements other than h and fe ) .",
    "these minor caveats aside , the availability of large samples of stars with both detailed elemental abundance ratios and full kinematic information allows us to improve upon the investigation of the galaxy - accretion connection through the combination of detailed elemental abundance ratios and a purely kinemetic classification scheme .",
    "we have examined the kinematic and abundance information in fulbright ( 2000 , 2002 ; 179 stars ) , stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 = sb02 ; 41 stars not included in fulbright ) , hansen et al.(1998 ; 44 stars not in sb02 nor fulbright ) , bensby et al.(2003 ; 21 thick disk and 45 thin disk stars ) , nissen & schuster ( 1997 = ns97 ; 13 halo stars and 16 disk stars ) , prochaska ( 2000 ; 10 thick disk stars ) , reddy et al.(2003 ; 179 thin & thick disk stars , not in the previous analyses ) and edvardsson et al.(1993 ; 181 thin & thick disk stars , also not in previous analyses ) .",
    "we have also included elemental abundances from other surveys that do not have kinematic information ( see table  1 ) , including two unusual halo stars near [ fe / h ] @xmath9 by ivans et al.(2003 ) .",
    "all data used in this analysis is available electronically ; a sample is shown in table  2 .    where @xmath10 velocity information are available , we used a standard bayesian classification scheme to assign each data point to either : the thin disk , thick disk , or halo using the galactic gaussian velocity ellipsoid components given in table  3 .",
    "stars with extreme u , v , w measures ( _ i.e. _ a low probability of being normal halo stars ) were further subdivided into significantly retrograde motions ( @xmath11 kms@xmath2 ) ] and those with an extreme toomre components ( @xmath12 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "since these samples of the solar neighbourhood are rather heterogeneous in nature and have been deliberately chosen to enhance the less populous local components , we used a uniform prior in assigning membership probabilities and have ignored subtleties of variation of the average rotation velocity with vertical distance from the galactic plane ( _ e.g. _ chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "the resulting colour - coded distribution of the classified galactic stars in the v - t plane is shown in fig .  1 ( left panel ) .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 is the variation of [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath0/fe ] , and [ na / fe ] as a function of rotation velocity , which demonstrates the expected general trend of metallicity for the different galactic components ( similar to fulbright s fig .  5 ) and some interesting general population trends in the element ratios .",
    "the metallicity plots also clearly show the large scatter and overlap between the different galactic components ( as discussed by unavane et al.1996 , gilmore & wyse 1998 ) , most notably between the halo and thick disk .",
    "kinematically , we are able to distinguish the thin disk , thick disk , and halo stars , and confirm that there is a significant overlap in the chemical properties of these various components ; see fig .  1",
    ". we also highlight the significantly ( @xmath13 ) retrograde and high toomre velocity stars .",
    "their metallicities overlap with the halo stars implying metallicity alone can not be used to identify them .",
    "intriguingly , the clump in metallicity of the majority of the extreme retrograde stars suggests an unexpected uniformity in their chemical properties , which is reflected in their [ @xmath0/fe ] values and in mostly low [ na / fe ] values . this suggests a common , and different origin for this population relative to the majority halo component .",
    "these stars also differ from ivans et al.(2003 ) three chemically peculiar ( cp ) outer halo stars ; they have similar mean [ fe / h ] values , but the cp stars have more distinctive [ ( mg , ca , ti , ni)/fe ] ratio and [ s&r / fe ] upper limits .    for completeness we also performed a statistical decomposition of the elemental abundance patterns from fulbright s ( 2000 , 2002 ) large sample to optimise the use of abundance information . after examining the normalised parameter covariance matrix and undertaking a principal components analysis we concluded that :    \\(1 ) the @xmath0-elements , including mg ,",
    "si , ca , and ti , are tightly correlated ( @xmath14 ) with one another .",
    "the eu abundances are also well correlated ( @xmath15 ) with these .",
    "this is not unexpected since all are produced in type - ii sne events , although there are nucleosynthetic details that make an exact one - to - one correlation with eu unlikely ( e.g. , sneden et al.2000 , hill et al.2002 , johnson & bolte 2002 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the next most dominant signal comes from [ na / fe ] which does not correlate well with [ @xmath0/fe ] ( @xmath16 ) nor [ fe / h ] ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "again this is not surprising .",
    "na is thought to form like the @xmath0 elements ( discussed further in section  [ sodium ] ) , yet the na yield is controlled by the neutron excess .",
    "the lack of correlation between [ na / fe ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] is unlike the results by fulbright ( 2002 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the majority of the remaining variance ( information ) in the chemical ratios is fairly evenly distributed among the remaining elements with no clear statistical signal standing out .    from this",
    "we conclude that the combination of probability - based kinematic classification with metallicity and abundance ratios offers a promising methodolgy for investigating stellar populations in the galaxy , particularly as the sample sizes of hip stars with abundances increases .",
    "we investigate these correlations more closely in the following sections .",
    "the evolution of the chemical abundances in a galaxy is intimately linked to its star formation history ( e.g. , tinsley 1979 ; pagel 1998 ) , and one ratio of particular interest is [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "alpha - elements are produced primarily in high - mass stars of negligible lifetimes and ejected by sn ii events , while iron is produced in both sn ii and sn ia events .",
    "a simple prediction is that stars that form shortly after the interstellar medium has been enriched by sne ii should have enriched [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , while those that form sometime after the sne ia contribute will have higher iron abundances and lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios . as described by matteucci ( 2003 ) , the timescale for changes in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio depends not only on the sfh , but also on the imf , the sne ia timescale , and the timescales for mixing the sne ia and sne ii products back into the interstellar medium .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio observed in metal - poor stars in the galactic halo is @xmath18 + 0.4 , and includes o , mg , si , ca , and ti ( as reviewed by mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "this [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is consistent with an initial burst of star formation that had a standard imf , after @xmath31 gyr and before sne ia began to contribute significant amounts of fe without @xmath0-elements ( matteucci 2003 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios for three @xmath0 elements ( mg , ca , ti ) are plotted individually and averaged together .",
    "as expected , the metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy show high [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , while the thin disk stars show [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios that approach solar with increasing metallicity .",
    "notice also that the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of the thin disk blend smoothly with those from the thick disk , which blend in smoothly with the halo stars .",
    "thus , the plateau in [ @xmath0/fe ] is the same , but the pattern in [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] differs .",
    "sb02 and fulbright ( 2002 ) suggested that [ @xmath0/fe ] is weakly and smoothly correlated with stellar apogalactic distance , or galactic rest frame velocity .",
    "however , with our classifications based purely on kinematics2 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath191 ) which mixes his halo and disk populations . ]",
    ", it is clear that these apparent correlations are primarily caused by _ the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the extreme retrograde stars alone _ ; see fig .  1 . without extreme retrograde stars in the sample",
    ", there would be no significant [ @xmath0/fe ] trend with distance , thus we do not support the suggestion of an [ @xmath0/fe ] trend in the galactic halo .",
    "we also find that the dsph stars are well separated from the majority of galactic disk and halo stars in fig .",
    "this was first shown by tolstoy et al.(2003 ; fig .",
    "15 ) . on closer inspection , the extreme retrograde component and possibly the high toomre velocity component of the galactic stars",
    "overlap with the dsph ratios better than the normal galactic halo component .",
    "however these high velocity galactic components do not include stars with the lowest [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios seen in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "of course , from kinematics alone the extreme retrograde component is the most likely to come from satellite accretion events , unfortunately the chemistry of these stars are not similar .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ afedisc ] .    finally , in fig .  2 , we also notice that the scatter in [ @xmath0/fe ] in the dsph stars is much larger for [ mg / fe ] than either [ ca / fe ] or [ ti / fe ] .",
    "thus , the overlap between the dsph and extreme retrograde ( and possibly high toomre velocity ) stars is best for [ mg / fe ] and worst for [ ti / fe ] .",
    "recently , shetrone ( 2004 ) has shown that the relative abundances of [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] in dsphs do tend to lie below those of [ mg / fe ] , which can also be seen in our fig .",
    "is not seen in most of the galactic stars ( except possibly in a few very metal - poor stars , e.g. , see aoki et al.2002 ) , and could be related to differences in nucleosynthesis .",
    "for example , mg forms through hydrostatic c- and o - burning in the cores of massive stars , whereas some isotopes of ca ( e.g. , @xmath20ca , woosley & weaver 1995 ) and ti ( e.g. , @xmath21ti , nakamura et al.2001 ) are thought to form in the @xmath0-process - process ( or @xmath0-rich freeze out ) may occur when neutron - rich , @xmath0-rich gas is out from nuclear statistical equilibrium , such as in the high entropy wind that blows from the surface of a proto neutron star following core collapse ( woosley & hoffman 1992 ; nakamura et al.2001 ) . ] . if these processes occur together ( in the same stars or in a fully populated imf ) then the [ mg / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] ratios will show the same trends as one another in metal - poor stars , such as is seen in the galactic halo stars .",
    "however , these ratios may differ from one another in the dsph galaxies due to differences in their star formation histories , imf , stellar yields , or mixing timescales .",
    "nakamura et al.(2001 ) suggest the @xmath0-process occurs in hypernovae ( with energies @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg ) , evidenced by high [ si / o ] ratios in star burst galaxies .",
    "the difference in the [ ( ca , ti)/fe ] ratios compared to [ mg / fe ] in the dwarf galaxies may suggest a lack of hypernovae in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this would be a similar suggestion as that made by tolstoy et al.(2003 ) of an effectively truncated upper imf in these low mass dwarf galaxies with their slower chemical evolution and possibly lower total mass star formation events . as another alternative , regos et al.(2003 ) show that substantial amounts of @xmath20ti , which decays to @xmath20ca , can be produced by sne ia through exploding he white dwarfs .",
    "this source can help to explain the solar system @xmath20ca , which is underestimated from the standard sn ii yields ( timmes et al.1995 ) and standard exploding chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf yields ( livne & arnett 1995 ) .",
    "if significant amounts of ca and ti are produced through standard sn ii , standard sn ia , and exploding he white dwarfs , then differences in the star formation histories in dsph galaxies _ alone _ could yield variations in [ ca / mg ] and [ ti / mg ] in dsphs relative to galactic stars , without affecting the imf .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is a fundamental chemical signature in stars because it depends on the relative contributions of sn ii to sn ia products available when the star formed .",
    "other element ratios are equally fundamental signatures , but possibly more difficult to interpret .",
    "an example of another fundamental chemical signature are the s- and r - process ratios in a star , i.e. , relative abundances of elements formed through rapid ( r - process ) and slow ( s - process ) neutron captures .",
    "interpretation of these ratios is complicated by the uncertainty in the exact sources ( and thus yields ) of the r - process and s - process ( c.f . ,",
    "johnson & bolte 2002 ) .",
    "generally , the r - process abundances are linked to sne ii events and a high entropy neutrino wind at the surface of the newly formed neutron star ( duncan et al.1986 ; woosley et al.1994 ) , although merging neutron stars ( rosswog et al.2000 ) and asymmetric explosions and jet - like like outflows from newly born neutron stars ( leblanc & wilson 1970 ; cameron 2003 ) are other possibilities .",
    "there are also two known sources for s - process elements , including low - mass agb stars responsible for the _ main _ s - process ( busso et al.1999 ) , and helium burning in massive stars ( the _ weak _ s - process ) which only contributes material with @xmath24 and hence elements lighter than or up to zr ( e.g. , prantzos et al.1990 ; raiteri et al.1992 ) .    in the galaxy , interpretations of the metal - poor stellar abundances suggest that s - process contributions do not occur until [ fe / h ] @xmath25 and are not significant until near [ fe / h ] @xmath26 ( e.g. , travaglio et al.2004 ) .",
    "qian & wasserburg ( 2001 ) developed a phenomenological model that interprets all heavy element abundances in galactic stars in terms of pure r - process contributions up to [ fe / h ] @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is not clear that the s- and r - process abundance ratios in the dwarf galaxies need to coincide with those in the galaxy as a function of time or [ fe / h ] . the lower star formation efficiency in the dwarf galaxies ( tolstoy et al.2003 ; matteucci 2003 ) means that metals will build up more slowly with time than in the galaxy , and",
    "thus we might expect contributions from more metal - poor stars ( e.g. , metal poor agb stars ) at a given time or metallicity . coupled with the fact that stellar yields are often metallicity dependent , then the s- and r - process ratios in stars in dwarf galaxies may be different from comparable metallicity stars in the galaxy .    to examine differences in the r- and s - process ratios in dsph galaxies ,",
    "we use the y , ba , la , and eu abundances . y , ba , and la are important because they sample different peaks in the neutron magic numbers .",
    "y ( z=39 ) belongs to the first peak that builds through rapid captures around neutron magic number n=50 .",
    "ba ( z=56 ) and la ( z=57 ) belong to the second peak that builds around n=82 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not sample any element from the third peak that builds around n=126 .",
    "since these elements may form through either r- or s - processing , then we also examine eu , an element that is largely from the r - process in the sun ( 95% burris et al.2000 ) .    the ratios of [ y / fe ] , [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , and [ eu / fe ] in the dsphs and galactic stars are shown in fig .",
    "the atomic data and spectral lines of y , ba , and eu were compared between the datasets .",
    "similar atomic data were used for the baii ( 1 - 5 lines ) and euii ( 1 line ) abundances , while offsets were found for yii ( 1 - 6 lines ) .",
    "adjustments were made to the yii abundances to account for mean differences in adopted oscillator strengths , including adjusting the nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) results down by @xmath28 dex , adjusting the stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) results down by @xmath28 dex , and adjusting the edvardsson et al.(1993 ) results down by @xmath29 dex .",
    "the baii abundances in mcwilliam ( 1995 ) were replaced with those from mcwilliam ( 1998 ) .",
    "the euii abundances for the edvardsson et al.(1993 ) dataset are from koch & edvardsson ( 2002 ) . for laii",
    ", we compare with burris et al.(2000 ) and johnson ( 2002 ) only .",
    "the first impression is that the dsph stars span a larger range in all three ratios at intermediate metallicities than the galactic stars . at very low metallicities ,",
    "the large ranges seen in the galactic star data are interpreted as inhomogeneous mixing i.e. , the proximity to a recent sn ii event will vary the ratios of the r - process elements in newly formed stars ( c.f .",
    ", mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "possibly inhomogeneous mixing plays a role at intermediate metallicities in the dsph stars , particularly as [ eu / fe ] shows a large range and is primarily an r - process element .",
    "this might be expected if their star formation was similar to the stochastic star formation observed in the local group dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , dohm - palmer et al.1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "however , we also notice that [ y / fe ] is significantly lower / offset in the dsph stars than in the galaxy .",
    "this includes roughly half of the dsph stars , and suggests the r- and s - process enrichment of this element differs between the galaxies .",
    "to examine the s - process and r - process contributions separately , we also examine the [ y / eu ] , [ ba / eu ] , and [ la / eu ] ratios in fig .",
    ", the galactic stars show signs of inhomogeneous mixing in the most metal - poor stars ( presumably due to variations in the _ r - process _ contributions to y and ba from localized sne ii events ) . by [ fe / h ]",
    "= @xmath30 , the [ ba / eu ] abundances are above the pure r - process plateau ( near [ ba / eu ] = @xmath190.7 , e.g. , burris et al.2000 ) , however this is not clearly due to s - process contributions .",
    "the [ la / eu ] abundances are close to the predicted pure r - process values , and @xmath31la should show similar behavior to @xmath32ba , having a similar nucleosynthetic history and s - process contributions in the solar system .",
    "johnson & bolte ( 2001 ) showed that the interpretation of the ba abundance in this metallicity range is complicated , and that the rise in [ ba / eu ] may not be due to s - process contributions but difficulties in the analysis of the strong baii 4554   line .",
    "thus , the galactic data would move closer to the pure r - process line , but not the dsph data since we did not use the 4554   line ( shetrone et al.2003 , 2001 ) .",
    "the [ ba / eu ] ratios in dsph stars also suggest a smooth rise starting near [ fe / h ] = @xmath30 .",
    "this rise is expected to be due to contributions from the s - process from agb stars .",
    "that [ y / eu ] remains low in most of the dsph stars suggests contributions from _ metal - poor _ agb stars , where first peak elements ( like y ) are bypassed in favour of second peak ( like ba and la ; and third peak , which is unobserved ) elements because there are fewer nuclei to absorb the available neutrons .",
    "thus , high [ ba / y ] ratios are consistent with the expectations from metal - poor agb s - process yields ( travaglio et al.2004 ) .",
    "we are not suggesting that all of the dsph stars show metal - poor agb contributions though .",
    "the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) dsph stars have [ la / eu ] ratios in agreement with the pure r - process predictions@xmath33 ) , this star has a very large [ ba / eu ] ratio suggestive of a signficant s - process contribution ( unfortunately , we do not have [ la / eu ] to confirm ) . that its [ ba / y ] ratio is also very large is in agreement with the expectations from metal - poor agb contributions outlined above . ] ( and [ ba / eu ] is within 1  @xmath34 of the pure r - process ratios ) .",
    "therefore , the y abundance in the most metal - poor dsph stars must also be purely r - processed . why is [ y / eu ] so low in these stars , and [ ba / y ] so high , if they are all from the same nucleosynthetic site ?",
    "this result suggests that the site of _ r - processed _ y must differ from that of r - processed ba , la , and eu ; is there a _ weak _ r - process site ( discussed further in section 6.2 ) ?",
    "also , the source that produces y in the metal - poor galactic stars must be absent in the dsphs or it must have a different time lag relative to the ba , la , and eu enrichments .    regardless of the exact nucleosynthetic interpretation of the offsets in the [ y / eu ] and [ ba / y ] ratios , it is clear from fig .",
    "4 that about half of the dsph stars have lower [ y / eu ] ratios , and 2/3 have higher [ ba / y ] ratios than their galactic counterparts , including the extreme retrograde halo stars .",
    "this offset suggests that no significant stellar component of the galaxy is formed from disrupted dsphs .",
    "we discuss this further in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) noticed that a group of 8 halo stars have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than disk stars of the same metallicity , and that these stars were also underabundant in na and ni .",
    "the [ na / fe ] ratios were well correlated with [ ni / fe ] , and they pointed out that the na and @xmath0-element depletions were largest for those stars probing the largest galactocentric distances , the ns97 sample probes stars with unusual kinematics , biased towards stars with nearly radial orbits and 8 @xmath3517",
    ". thus they do not sample stars that are truly in the outer galactic halo . ] .",
    "this is in agreement with fulbright ( 2002 ) who found low [ na / fe ] occured only in stars with large galactocentric distances ( @xmath36 kpc ) .",
    "stephens ( 1999 ) found no chemical differences ( [ na / fe ] nor [ @xmath0/fe ] ) between 5 inner and 5 outer halo stars over a wider metallicity range ( @xmath37 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ) than ns97 , however the larger survey by stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) did suggest a slight gradient in [ @xmath0/fe ] ( 0.1 dex over 10 kpc , but with a dispersion of 0.1 to 0.2 dex ) , but did not comment further on [ na / fe ] with distance . ns97",
    "further proposed that their stars might be remnants from an accreted dsph galaxy , and that perhaps the na - ni relationship they detected is an indicator of the merging history of the galaxy .    in fig .  5 ( top panel )",
    ", we confirm the na - ni relationship found by ns97 for metal - rich stars (",
    "@xmath38 [ fe / h ] @xmath39 ; recall that we include the ns97 data , thus could expect to recover their na - ni relationship ) .",
    "the exact relationship appears slightly offset and steeper than reported by ns97 ( the line in fig .",
    "5 is from their data alone ) .",
    "the na and ni abundances in the dsph stars in this metallicity range also agree reasonably well with the ns97 trend ( also discussed in shetrone et al.2003 ) .",
    "broadening the metallicity range to include all the stars from the literature examined here , then the correlation is less distinct , but still present for most of the galactic stars ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "but , the dsph stars show no correlation .",
    "that the na - ni trend , reported by ns97 , is _ not _ clearly seen in the dsph stars implies that the chemical evolution of these stars differs from the galactic stars , as suggested by ns97 , but not in a way that makes this a useful indicator of merging .",
    "if the na - ni trend is a natural consequence of the nucleosynthesis of neutron - rich elements ( as discussed below ) , then it is less likely that a large fractions ( @xmath4050% ) of the metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath41 ) halo may have formed through disrupted dsph galaxies like those studied here ; we suggested this in shetrone et al.(2003 ) after observing that 50% of our dsph stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath41 show the na - ni relationship .",
    "the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the ns97 sample does indicate something odd in the formation of those stars though ( discussed further in section  [ afedisc ] ) .",
    "a slight and positive correlation between na and ni is a natural result of nucleosynthesis in massive stars ( c.f . ,",
    "clayton 1983 , section 5.6 ) . as timmes et al.(1995 ) suggests , na is made by massive stars and delivered to the ism in the sn ii events .",
    "the amount of na produced is controlled by the neutron excess ( primarily through the @xmath42ne content)na yield may depend on the initial heavy element abundance in a star ( e.g. , arnett 1971 ) , because the @xmath42ne _ production _ in a star is not strongly metallicity dependent ( arnould & norgaard 1978 ) . ] during hydrostatic c - burning .",
    "while @xmath43na is naturally produced during hydrostatic c - burning in the core , the amount of @xmath43na produced relative to @xmath44 mg ranges from 1:2 to 1:5 , depending on the temperature for c - burning ( related to the mass of the star ) .",
    "but what is noteworthy is that @xmath43na is the only stable neutron - rich isotope produced in significant quantity during either the c- or o - burning stages .",
    "this is significant for the later formation of the stable @xmath45ni isotope . during the sne ii event ,",
    "the entire core photodissociates the elements to protons and neutrons , which will be near equilibrium and recombine to form @xmath32ni , which beta decays to @xmath32fe , the dominant isotope of iron .",
    "some @xmath46fe ( primarily ) and also @xmath45ni can be produced at this stage , depending on the abundance of the neutron - rich elements , e.g. , @xmath43na , which is more common than other potential neutron - rich sources ( such as @xmath47c ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath46fe made is small compared to the total yield of iron ( dominated by the @xmath32fe production ) , but this is the main source for @xmath45ni , the stable isotope of nickel . in summary , the ni production depends on the neutron excess during the photodissociation of the core during the sn ii event , and the neutron excess will depend primarily on the amount of @xmath43na produced earlier during hydrostatic c - burning .",
    "thus , a na - ni relationship is expected over a wide range in sne ii metallicities .",
    "the contributions from sne ia can complicate the pattern , mainly because of the variety of sne ia sources .",
    "nickel is produced without na in the standard model of sne ia , where a co white dwarf tips over the chandrasekhar limit and the c - burning region is completely photodissociated ( tsujimoto et al.1995 ) .",
    "this would flatten the na - ni correlation .",
    "however , the route to sne ia is convoluted , and doubtless involves rare binary star interactions ( e.g. , regs et al.2003 ) .",
    "it is quite uncertain what the na yields from these might be , e.g. , if a co white dwarf accretes a he white dwarf , perhaps the build up of he on the surface may undergo c - burning and release na before the star photodissociates to form ni in the sn event .",
    "thus , it is not clear exactly what the sne ia contributions are to the na - ni correlation , although we can expect some sort of slight , positive slope ( where the specific slope depends on the sne ii yields and the variety of sne ia contributions ) , as seen in the galactic data .",
    "finally , the fact that the dsph stars and very metal - poor halo stars ( open symbols are those without kinematic information ) lie well off of the trend suggests two things ; for the na - rich stars , possibly there are additional contributions to na from merging white dwarfs , and for the ni - rich stars , possibly additional contributions from a ni rich sn ii or sn ia event . that most of the galactic stars that lie well off the na - ni trend are the very metal - poor stars supports this suggestion because there is evidence from the heavy element ratios for inhomogeneous mixing at early epochs ( mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "before leaving our discussion on na nucleosynthesis , we also find the well known relationship between na and mg , as observed in disk and halo stars ( ns97 , hanson et al.1998 , pilachowski et al.1996 ) .",
    "we confirm the na - mg relationship in the same metallicity range examined by ns97 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath48 ) in dwarf stars , fig .",
    "6 ( top panel ) , though with a slightly flatter slope .",
    "however , _ the giant stars _ ( bottom panel ) _ in both the galaxy and dsphs _ show a scatter of [ na / mg ] abundances that is distinctly different from that of the dwarfs .",
    "we believe this scatter is related to metallicity and not necessarily a problem in the na determination in the giants .",
    "a similar difference was noticed between field stars and cluster giants by sb02 , where the cluster abundances were discussed in terms of internal , `` deep '' mixing which can alter the composition of the stellar envelope through mixing with cno - cycled gas .",
    "alternatively , here we notice that most of the ( field ) giants have [ mg / h ] @xmath49 whereas most of the dwarfs are above this .",
    "the few giants above this metallicity are in good agreement with the linear relation shown by the dwarfs , and the few dwarfs below this metallicity are in good agreement with the large scatter seen in the giants .",
    "thus , we do not believe that this change in the na - mg pattern at [ mg / h ] @xmath50 is due to a change in the nucleosynthesis of na . instead , it is more likely to be related to the quantities of mg formed through hydrostatic c - burning ( where @xmath44 mg and @xmath43na are both produced ) relative to mg formation through hydrostatic o - burning and ne - burning .",
    "the na - mg correlation is tightest at higher metallicities ( @xmath38 [ mg / h ] @xmath39 ) , thus the yields of mg and na are primarily from c - burning , whereas hydrostatic o- and ne - burning were probably more significant to the total mg abundance at earlier epochs .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to compare the chemical properties of stars in the current , expanded sample of low mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies to those of kinematically selected stars in the galaxy .",
    "we have found that no population of stars in the galaxy is representative of stars in the low mass dwarfs , in agreement with previous analyses ( shetrone et al.2001 , 2003 ; fulbright 2002 ; stephens & boesgaard 2002 ; ivans et al.2003 ; tolstoy et al.2003 ) . here",
    ", we discuss the differences in the fundamental chemical signatures , [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ ( ba / y)/eu ] , and point out interesting differences that must occur in their nucleosynthetic histories .",
    "of course , we are comparing only a few stars from seven dwarf galaxies , each with a unique star formation and evolutionary history .",
    "the best way to approach further investigations for new , fundamental constraints of chemical nucleosynthesis is to examine many stars within individual dwarf galaxies .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio has been proposed as a litmus test for chemical evidence of a satellite accretion in the galactic halo ( e.g. , unavane et al.1996 , gilmore & wyse 1998 ) .",
    "early comparisons of a sample of 13 galactic halo stars by nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) found a trend of decreasing [ @xmath0/fe ] with increasing apogalactic distance , @xmath51 .",
    "they suggested that these outer halo stars might have been accreted from a dwarf galaxy with a slower chemical evolution history than the inner halo and disk stars .",
    "these results were challenged by stephens ( 1999 ) who compared 5 outer to 5 inner halo dwarf stars and found uniform abundances in all elements , however a larger survey by stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) suggest the potential for a slight trend in [ @xmath0/fe ] versus galactocentric distance ( though the slope is @xmath3 1  @xmath34 in the [ @xmath0/fe ] dispersion ) . fulbright ( 2002 ) also suggests that lower [ na / fe ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] stars may be found in the outer halo ( @xmath36 kpc ) .",
    "interestingly the ns97 sample probes only a very limited range of the halo , 8 @xmath3517 , and is biased toward stars which are on almost radial orbits .",
    "this led gilmore & wyse ( 1998 ) to question the conclusion of an accretion event origin for the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ns97 stars , because their very small @xmath52 orbits would be difficult to populate from tidally disrupting a dwarf .",
    "stephens ( 1999 ) concluded that the litmus test of low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios is probably insufficient to distinguish accreted debris from native stars .    our results from fig .",
    "2 suggest that low [ @xmath0/fe ] is characteristic of most stars in the dwarf galaxies , but should not be used as a litmus test .",
    "some dsph stars have higher [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios like the galactic stars , and span a wide range in [ @xmath0/fe ] from the halo plateau to subsolar values . in fig .  7 ( left panel ) , we show the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios for the stars in only the sculptor dsph ( shetrone et al.2003 and geisler et al.2004 ) .",
    "the stars with plateau [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios have old ages ( @xmath5315 gyr from isochrone fitting ; see tolstoy et al.2003 ) , consistent with the early chemical evolution of the halo ( i.e. , before significant sn  ia contributions ) .",
    "stars with lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at higher metallicities are consistent with theories of slow chemical evolution in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , matteucci 2003 ) .",
    "sculptor s star formation history ( e.g. , monkiewicz et al.1999 ; kaluzny et al.1995 ) , imply that the sn  ia began to contribute near [ fe / h]=@xmath191.8 ( instead of @xmath26 like in the galaxy ) .",
    "notice that a merger of sculptor at early times ( before significant sn  ia contributions ) would resemble normal ( plateau [ @xmath0/fe ] ) halo stars .    on the other hand , the stars in draco , also in fig .",
    "7 ( right panel ) , show uniformly low [ @xmath0/fe ] values at all metallicities , even though draco is thought to have had a very similar star formation history to sculptor ( mostly old stars , dolphin 2002 ) .",
    "this may signal other effects in the chemical evolution of draco ( such as blow - out or variations in its imf ) , or there may simply have too few stars in draco to properly sample its abundance pattern ( the draco [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios are within 2 @xmath34 of the higher halo values ) .",
    "since dsph s have a wide range of sfhs as determined from their cmds ( e.g. , mateo 1998 , dolphin 2002 ) , then it is likely there is a large range in their [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , particularly at intermediate metallicities .",
    "this emphasizes the need for abundance ratios in many stars in individual dwarf galaxies to properly interpret their chemical signatures and study halo formation through accretion events ( see section  [ mergers ] ) .",
    "does low [ @xmath0/fe ] in a metal - poor star in the galactic halo signal a formation site that differs from the rest of the halo ?",
    "one galactic halo star in our sample that clearly stands out in fig .",
    "2 is bd+80245 ( first noticed by carney et al.1997 from proper motion surveys ) ; it is the galactic halo star with very low [ @xmath0/fe ] ( = @xmath54 ) at [ fe / h ] = @xmath192.1 ( abundances from fulbright 2000 ; also recently analysed in detail by ivans et al.2003 ) . while its [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio does resemble that of a dsph star , it is ( nearly ) unique amongst the stars presently studied in the galaxy ( including when it is compared to two other chemically peculiar stars in the outer galactic halo which have surprisingly high [ ti / fe ] ratios ; ivans et al.2003 ) .",
    "also , other elemental ratios in this star do not resemble those in the dsphs ( see section 6.2 ) .",
    "the nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) low [ @xmath0/fe ] stars also stand out in the galactic data ( in fig .",
    "2 , they are the halo stars that lie just below the thin disk near [ fe / h]=@xmath55 ) .",
    "in fact , the ns97 stars have [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios that are similar to stars in the lmc and sgr dwarf galaxy ( discussed in section  [ mergers ] ) .",
    "also , some globular clusters with low [ @xmath0/fe ] abundances have been directly associated with merging galaxies , e.g. , pal12 ( dinescu et al.2000 ; brown , wallerstein , & zucker 1997 ) and ter 7 ( sbordone et al.2003 ; ibata , gilmore , irwin 1995 ) which are associated with the sgr dsph galaxy .",
    "low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios may also be responsible for differences between photometric and cat metallicity estimates for some clusters ( e.g. , sarajedini & layden 1997 ) , which might be attributed to globular clusters captured from accreted dwarf galaxies ( or possibly from the magellanic clouds ) .",
    "of course , a very successful way to identify accretion debris is through the kinematic phase space constraints of the tidal stream debris ( _ e.g. _ majewski et al.1996 ; helmi et al.1999 ) .",
    "determination of the chemical abundances in these stars could prove interesting !",
    "however , the stars associated kinematically with arcturus , and suggested by navarro et al.(2004 ) to have an extragalactic origin , do _ not _ have low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , making them unlike the stars in low mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact , the abundances in the arcturus group best resemble stars in the standard thick disk ( discussed further in section  [ mergers ] ) .    as a final note , gratton et al.(2003 )",
    "are currently reanalysing the stellar abundances in many of the galactic stars included here , as well as additional stars , to put the stellar abundances onto a uniform metallicity scale .",
    "their initial results suggest that there is a larger dispersion in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in their `` counter - rotating '' stars , stars with v @xmath56 kms@xmath2  or v@xmath57",
    "kms@xmath2   ( @xmath58 extreme retrograde stars , as defined in this paper where v@xmath59 kms@xmath2 ) , however their samples are not kinematically separated .",
    "their prograde stars are a mixture of halo , thin disk , and thick disk stars , while their counter - rotating stars are only halo stars ( i.e. , half of the gaussian distribution in halo star velocities ) .",
    "therefore , as expected , their counter - rotating stars have higher mean [ @xmath0/fe ] and lower mean [ fe / h ] than their prograde sample ( although the scatter in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios for the counter - rotating stars is much larger than for their prograde stars ) .      the offset in the [ ba / y ] ratios in the dsph stars shown in fig .",
    "4 was previously seen by shetrone et al.(2003 ) .",
    "this was interpreted as due to differences in the sfh in the dsphs , leading to agb contributions in the dsphs from a more homogeneous sample of stars ( mass and metallicity ) compared to the galaxy . in the galaxy ,",
    "a variety of agb stars are likely to confuse any patterns in the individual agb yields ( mcwilliam 1997 ) . in section  [ bay ] , we developed this interpretation slightly . for the dsph stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath60",
    ", the low y suggests an _ r - process _",
    "contribution from a different source than ba and la , or a time delay in the _ r - process _",
    "y production . for the dsph stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath61",
    ", the low y suggests contributions primarily from low metallicity agb stars .",
    "while this interpretation is consistent with the theoretical predictions for metallicity - dependent agb yields ( travaglio et al.2004 ) , and the differences in the dsph star formation histories , there are other possibilities to consider .",
    "other options that might affect the [ ba / y ] ratios in the chemical evolution of a galaxy are a change in the sne yields / rates , or a change in the influence of the @xmath0-process ( @xmath0-rich freeze out )",
    ".    _ sne ii yields : _ to investigate the role of sne yields / rates , we examine the phenonenological model to reproduce the r - process abundances in the galaxy by qian & wasserburg ( 2001 ) .",
    "their model describes the synthesis of the r - process ( and associated ) elements in the galaxy in terms of two types of sne ii , the h and l events .",
    "the high frequency h events produce heavy r - process elements , like eu , but no fe ( presumably retained in black hole remnants ) .",
    "the low frequency l events produce light r - process elements ( up to ba ) and fe . given the eu and fe abundance in a star with [ fe / h ] @xmath62 in the galaxy , then their model can accurately compute the rest of the r - process element ratios .",
    "it is not clear that this model is appropriate for stars in the dsph galaxies .",
    "the model predicts the low [ ba / y ] ratios found in the galactic stars at these metallicities , but not the high [ ba / y ] ratios observed in the dwarf galaxy stars . their model uses the observed discontinuity in the galactic [ ba / fe ] ratio near [ fe / h]=@xmath63 to determine the l and h sne frequency and yields .",
    "if this approach is correct , then there should be a similar behavior in the dsph stellar abundances , though not necessarily at the same metallicity due to differences in the mixing of metals in a galaxy , the l and h sne frequencies , and possibly in the star formation history .",
    "we also note that they needed to correct the l event r - process contributions to sr , y , zr , and ba from the arlandini et al.(1999 ) estimates to reproduce the solar r - process inventory .",
    "surprisingly , if arlandini et al.s values are used , then the predicted [ ba / y ] ratios are in good agreement with the dwarf galaxy stellar ratios . this ad hoc approach would imply different contributions and/or sites for the formation of sr , y , zr , and ba between the dsph s and the galaxy , or possibly different retention yields if there is also mass loss driven by the sne ii events .",
    "_ sne ii rates / imf : _ while changing the sne ii _ yields _ between sites is presently ad hoc , changing the frequency of events is less so , although it does suggest that the upper imf is affected ( and thus not universal ) .",
    "for example , if higher mass stars are primary sites for the production of sr , y , and zr , then truncating the upper imf would reduce their contributions in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this may even affect both the [ ba / y ] _ and _ [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios since higher @xmath0 yields are predicted from higher mass stars .",
    "this option was discussed in detail by tolstoy et al.(2003 ) .",
    "smith et al.(2002 ) used this approach to explain their low [ o / fe ] ratios in 12 lmc field giants . using a simplified chemical evolution model",
    ", they found one possible solution would be to lower the sn ii rate slightly more than the sn ia rate per unit mass in the lmc .",
    "the young star forming complex r136 in the lmc is also an interesting example ; weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) point out that a standard salpeter imf predicts that r136 should contain a star with m @xmath22 750 m@xmath64 ( or at least 10 - 40 stars @xmath22150 m@xmath64 , the maximum mass observed ) .",
    "does this suggest the upper imf in r136 is truncated ?",
    "weidner & kroupa do conclude that there appears to be a maximum stellar mass limit ( e.g. , the eddington mass limit ) or that the upper imf is not invariant .",
    "nevertheless , if the upper mass limit is 150 m@xmath64 , then this is much higher than that needed to explain the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the dsphs .",
    "tolstoy et al.(2003 ) showed that the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the dsph require a maximum stellar mass closer to 12 m@xmath64 .",
    "this low maximum stellar mass is problematic in terms of current star formation theory .",
    "if the imf is a statistical property of a galaxy , then it should be fully populated over the integrated star formation history of the galaxy ( c. clarke and m.s .",
    "oey , 2003 , priv .",
    "communications ) .",
    "detailed studies of star formation in galaxies show that the concentrations of molecular gas where star formation occurs are highly fractal , with structures from a few thousand to 1 m@xmath65 ( c.f .",
    ", larson review , 2003 ) .",
    "even the orion nebula complex ( onc ) , a site of recent and active star formation , has a gas mass of only 10@xmath66 m@xmath64 and a total stellar mass of only @xmath5310@xmath67 m@xmath64 , but it has formed a 50 m@xmath64 star ( e.g. , hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the upper imf differs between the dsph galaxies , and the star forming regions in the lmc and galactic disk .",
    "the molecular gas mass scales are significantly less than the total mass in all of these systems , and the onc suggests that even low gas mass systems can form high mass stars .    _",
    "the @xmath0-process : _ the @xmath0-process ( or @xmath0-rich freeze out ) may occur when neutron - rich , @xmath0-rich gas is out of nuclear statistical equilibrium , such as in the high entropy wind that blows from the surface of a proto neutron star following core collapse . as mentioned in section  [ alpha ] , the @xmath0-process is thought to be important in the formation of @xmath20ca ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) and @xmath21ti ( nakamura et al.2001 ) . it was also identified as a possible site for light r - process element formation by woosley & hoffman ( 1992 ) . if the @xmath0-process contributes to @xmath0 _ and _ light r - process element production in the galaxy , but _ not _ in the dwarf galaxies , then we might expect lower [ @xmath0/fe ] and lower [ y / eu ] ratios as is observed .",
    "since nakamura et al.(2001 ) suggest the @xmath0-process occurs in hypernovae ( with energies @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg ) , then a lack of hypernovae in dwarf galaxies may be indicated .",
    "this would be similar to effectively truncating the upper imf in dwarf galaxies .",
    "if the @xmath0-process is responsible for _ both _ the low [ mg/(ca , ti ) ] ratios ( see section 3 ) and the low [ y / eu ] observations ( see section 4 ) , then we might expect a relationship between ( ca , ti ) and y. in fig .",
    "8 , we plot the [ mg / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] against [ y / fe ] for metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 ) , which allows us to focus on the sne ii yields alone .",
    "the galactic data does suggest a rise in [ ti / fe ] with [ y / fe ] , which is marginally supported by [ ca / fe ] and absent in [ mg / fe ] as expected from the @xmath0-process predictions .",
    "the extant dsph data does not show the same galactic trends , in fact [ ti / fe ] may even decrease with increasing [ y / fe ] . thus ,",
    "if hypernovae and the @xmath0-process are responsible for a significant fraction of ti in the galaxy , then these plots suggest that this process is absent in the dsphs .",
    "since our dsph stars are from a variety of galaxies , we suggest this promising explanation of the @xmath0-process in hypernovae ( or lack of it ) should be further investigated when many stars in each dsph galaxy become available .",
    "regardless of the nucleosynthetic explanations for the low [ @xmath0/fe ] and high [ ba / y ] ratios in most stars in dsph galaxies , clearly the chemical signatures of these stars are not the same as similar metallicity stars in the galaxy .",
    "also , the chemical signatures of the stars in the dsphs are broadly similar to one another , suggesting that the differences in their chemical evolution are small relative to the differences in the chemical evolution of the galaxy . together",
    ", these observations strongly imply that no significant component of the galaxy formed primarily through the merger of galaxies similar to these low mass dsphs ( i.e. , after they began to form stars ) .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies ( shetrone et al.2001 , 2003 ; fulbright 2002 ; stephens & boesgaard 2002 ; tolstoy et al.2003 ; ivans et al.2003 ) , but now includes detailed examination of individual kinematic components including the thick disk , the thin disk , the halo , and halo stars with extreme retrograde orbits in the galactic halo .",
    "we also have ages for the stars in the dsph galaxies .",
    "tolstoy et al.(2003 ) used isochrones to find that most stars are as old as the galactic globular cluster fiducials .",
    "thus , the galaxy can not have formed through late mergers of low mass dwarf galaxies similar to those seen today as predicted by some cdm models ( e.g. , abadi et al.2003 ) .",
    "however , we do not rule out significant merging at early epochs .",
    "some ( @xmath531/2 to 1/3 ) of the oldest stars in dsphs with [ fe / h ] @xmath69 have the same chemical signatures as ( standard ) galactic halo stars , i.e. , plateau [ @xmath0/fe ] and normal [ ba / y ] and [ eu / fe ] ratios .",
    "also , any ancient merging of dwarf galaxies that occurs before the dwarf undergoes significant star formation would not be tracable by comparisons of stellar abundances .",
    "this scenario has been investigated by bullock & johnston ( 2004 ) where inner halo stars are formed from the gas deposits of accreted low mass dwarf galaxies , thus inner halo stars do not resemble the stars in the surviving dsphs , but this does require that most of the merging happened at the earliest epochs so that an insignificant number of stars were formed _ in the pre - merged satellites_. their model also suggests significant substructure in the outer galactic halo such that outer galactic halo stars will not resemble dsph stars nor inner halo stars ( as has been observed for three stars by ivans et al.2003 ) .",
    "we do not rule out significant merging of higher mass dwarf galaxies in our analysis .",
    "higher mass galaxies are unlikely to have had the same slow chemical evolution of the low mass dsph s examined here . abundance ratios of stars in globular clusters in the lmc ( hill 2004 ; hill et al.2000 ) show galactic halo - plateau values in [ mg / fe ] at metallicities up to [ fe / h ] @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , smecker - hane & mcwilliam ( 2002 ) find higher [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in three metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath71 ) in the sgr dwarf remnant ( although bonifacio et al.2004 question whether these stars are representative of the sgr remnant or the globular cluster , m54 ) .",
    "these results overlap with stars in the galactic halo and thick disk well , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] , which are not well understood , and would be quite distinct from galactic stars . ] .    the lmc and sgr dwarf galaxy themselves can not be used to explain the formation of the galactic thick disk though , at least not through a late and violent merger event as envisioned by abadi et al.(2003 ) .",
    "differential abundances between thick and thin disk stars have shown that the thick disk stars have slightly _ higher _ [ @xmath0/fe ] abundances than thin disk stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath72 ( bensby et al.2003 ; feltzing et al.2003 ) . while this can not be seen in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios plotted for the whole dataset in fig .  2 , this can be seen beautifully when only the detailed and differential abundances from bensby et al.are examined ( our fig .  9 , and their figs . 12 and 13 ) .",
    "while the simplest explanation for this chemical offset is that the thick disk was enriched in sne ia products _",
    "after _ the formation of the thin disk ( due to delayed fe production in sn ia ) , it is not clear how this can happen .",
    "bensby et al.summarize five observational constraints for the discussion of the formation of the thick disk , and do favour a merger scenario .",
    "as they point out , heating from a merger event is expected to inflate the old thin disk to the velocity dispersions of today s thick disk , however , the merging galaxy would have had to be quite massive ( @xmath73 of the milky way disk ) , and these galaxies are now rare in the local group .",
    "we note however that the thick disk could not have formed from a disrupted galaxy that has similar chemistry to the lmc or the sgr dwarf . in fig .  9 , we show the [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] abundances from stars in the thick and thin disks , the dsphs , the lmc , and the sgr dwarf .",
    "the lmc and sgr have _ lower _ [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than the thick disk stars of comparable metallicity ( hill 2004 ; hill et al.2000 , 1995 ; luck et al.1998 ; bonifacio et al.2004 ) .",
    "thus , if the thick disk formed through a merger , then the chemical properties of that merged galaxy were unlike any dwarf galaxy currently in the local group .",
    "an alternative explanation might be that the thick disk formed through a merger with a _ gas - rich _ dwarf galaxy that had undergone very little star formation",
    ". the thick disk would be the remains of the heated old thin disk , and the present - day thin disk could have formed from diluted gas after settling into the rotational plane of the galaxy .",
    "dilution would lower [ fe / h ] , but have very little affect on the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , and might fit the unusual abundance pattern .",
    "finally , it is well known that these seven surviving dsph galaxies may not represent the typical merging galaxy , particularly if their location in the galaxy s dark matter halo has influenced their sfh , evolution , gas retention , structural properties , etc .",
    "( see the review by mateo 1998 ) .",
    "however , the stellar abundances in the lmc and sgr also show lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios than similar metallicity stars in the galaxy ( at least for [ fe / h ] @xmath74 ) .",
    "stellar abundances in dirr galaxies ( gas rich , relatively isolated low mass galaxies in the outer parts of the local group ) from young stars with [ fe / h]@xmath75 also show low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ( see venn et al.2001 , 2003 , 2004 and kaufer et al.2004 for results in ngc  6822 , wlm , gr  8 , and sex  a ) .",
    "these abundances are in excellent agreement with results from dsph galaxies , but not the galaxy .",
    "stellar abundances of old red giants in the isolated local group dirr and dsph galaxies would allow a direct determination of the chemistry in truly isolated galaxies , but is not currently possible and will be an interesting program for the next generation of elt telescopes .",
    "the assumption that the galactic dsphs have always been in the dark matter halo of our galaxy is also not clear .",
    "proper motion surveys suggest that most are bound to the galaxy ( e.g. , piatek et al.2003 ; schweitzer et al.1995 ) , however , fornax may have an unbound orbit ( piatek et al.2002 ) . in this case , a significant fraction of the sfh of fornax could have happened in isolation , in an enviroment potentially similar to that of protogalactic fragments .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to compare the chemical properties of stars in the current , expanded sample of low mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies to those of kinematically selected stars in the galaxy .",
    "these comparisons can also be used to examine nucleosynthesis since the chemical evolution of the dsph galaxies has been significantly different from that of the galaxy .",
    "a summary of our conclusions follows .",
    "\\(1 ) a galactic sample of 781 stars from the literature , most ( 694 ) with uvw velocity information , can been assigned to the thin disk , thick disk , standard halo , extreme retrograde motions ( v @xmath76 kms@xmath2 ) , and extreme toomre velocity components ( @xmath12 kms@xmath2 ) using gaussian velocity ellisoid components .",
    "the metallicity of these components has a significant overlap , therefore metallicity can not be used generally to assign a star to a stellar population .",
    "the known extreme retrograde stars tend to have very similar metallicities though , grouped near [ fe / h ] @xmath77 .",
    "\\(2 ) the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the galactic halo stars range from solar to the plateau value ( [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath530.4 ) , with the extreme retrograde stars tending towards a middle value of [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.2 .",
    "similarly , the galactic halo stars range from -0.4 @xmath3 [ na / fe ] @xmath3 0.4 , but with the extreme retrograde stars tending towards lower values ( [ na / fe]@xmath78 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) comparison of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios shows that no stellar population in the galaxy is representative of stars in the low mass dwarfs ( in agreement with previous analyses : shetrone et al.2001 , 2003 ; fulbright 2002 ; stephens & boesgaard 2002 ; ivans et al.2003 ; tolstoy et al.2003 ) .",
    "the extreme retrograde stars have the closest [ @xmath0/fe ] distribution to that of the dsph stars .",
    "it also appears that the individual @xmath0-element ratios in the dsphs show [ ti / fe ] @xmath3 [ ca / fe ] @xmath3 [ mg / fe ] , at least for the most metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath60 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) we find a new chemical signature in the dsph stars .",
    "the [ ba / y ] and [ y / eu ] ratios suggest that @xmath532/3 of the dsph stars are chemically different from stars in the galaxy , _ including the extreme retrograde stars _ which have normal galactic halo ratios of these elements .",
    "\\(5 ) interpretation of the r- and s - process abundance ratios is complicated . in the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) stars , we suggest that the offset between the dsph and galactic halo stars could be due to an additional r - process site ( e.g. , @xmath0-process ) , which would be lacking in the dsphs .",
    "this is because the [ la / eu ] ratios ( and possibly the [ ba / eu ] ratios ) are consistent with pure r - process abundances , and therefore the [ y / eu ] should also be purely from the r - process . thus , the offset in [ y / eu ] in the most metal - poor dsph stars is puzzling , unless there is an additional r - process site for this light ( first peak ) r - process element in the galactic stars .",
    "\\(6 ) in dsph and galactic halo stars above [ fe / h]@xmath79 , the rise in the s - process contributions to la , ba , and y can be seen .",
    "thus , the high [ ba / y ] ratios seen in these stars also suggest that the s - process contributions to ba and y differ .",
    "we suggest that contributions from metal - poor agb stars ( travaglio et al.2003 ) in the dsph galaxies would be consistent with these observations and their different star formation histories ( from that of the galaxy ) .",
    "other possibilities are also discussed , such as an effectively truncated imf , and/or selective outflows of sne ii gas .",
    "\\(7 ) we confirm the existance of the ni - na trend , as found by nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) who also discussed this as a potential chemical signature for stars from an accreted dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , we suggest that this trend is a natural consequence of the nucleosynthesis of neutron rich elements , and therefore _ not _ related to the accretion of dsph galaxies in the galactic halo .",
    "\\(8 ) we also discuss the [ na / mg ] relationship with [ mg / h ] in terms of yields from hydrostatic c - burning .",
    "this relationship breaks down below [ mg / h]=@xmath80 , most likely due to mg formation from hydrostatic o- and ne - burning at earlier epochs . that most of the stars with [ mg / h ] @xmath49 are giants is not signficant in terms of nucleosynthesis ; the giants are cooler and the spectral lines can be sharper and stronger , thus sensitive to lower abundances .    thus , the chemical signatures of the stars in the low mass dsph galaxies are unlike the available stars in all components of the galaxy .",
    "no component of the galaxy ( thick disk , thin disk , halo , extreme retrograde stars ) could have formed primarily through the merger and disruption of low mass dwarf galaxies such as these at later epochs .",
    "we do not rule out merging with higher mass galaxies , though remnants of the sgr dwarf galaxy found throughout the galactic halo have retained a distinct chemical signature ( e.g. , bonifacio et al.2004 ; also from the globular clusters associated with the sgr remnant , pal12 and ter 7 , dinescu et al.2000 , brown , wallerstein , & zucker 1997 , sbordone et al.2003 , and ibata , gilmore , irwin 1995 ) .",
    "we also do not rule out merging at very early epochs before low mass dwarf galaxies undergo signficant star formation .",
    "formation of the galaxy s thick disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled out , however the galaxy s thick disk itself can not be comprised of the remnants from a low mass ( dsph ) dwarf galaxy , nor a high mass dwarf galaxy like the lmc or sgr , due to differences in chemistry ( bensby et al.2003 ; prochaska 2000 ) . in the future",
    ", both the constraints for nucleosynthesis and the testing of hierarchical galaxy formation through mergers with dsph - like galaxies will require large samples of stars in individual dwarf galaxies .",

    "<S> to compare the chemistries of stars in the milky way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsph ) with stars in the galaxy , we have compiled a large sample of galactic stellar abundances from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> when kinematic information is available , we have assigned the stars to standard galactic components through bayesian classification based on gaussian velocity ellipsoids . as found in previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of most stars in the dsph galaxies are generally lower than similar metallicity galactic stars in this extended sample . </S>",
    "<S> our kinematically selected stars confirm this for the galactic halo , thin disk , and thick disk components . </S>",
    "<S> there is marginal overlap in the low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios between dsph stars and galactic halo stars _ on extreme retrograde orbits _ ( v @xmath1 kms@xmath2 ) , but this is not supported by other element ratios . </S>",
    "<S> other element ratios compared in this paper include r- and s - process abundances , where we find a significant offset in the [ y / fe ] ratios that result in a large overabundance in [ ba / y ] in _ most _ dsph stars compared to galactic stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the chemical signatures of most of the dsph stars are distinct from the stars in each of the kinematic components of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this result rules out continuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dsph satellites during the formation of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we do not rule out very early merging of low mass dwarf galaxies though , since @xmath31/2 of the most metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 ) have chemistries that are in fair agreement with galactic halo stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also do not rule out merging with higher mass galaxies , although we notice that the lmc and the remnants of the sgr dwarf galaxy are also chemically distinct from the majority of the galactic halo stars . </S>",
    "<S> formation of the galaxy s thick disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled out , however the galaxy s thick disk itself can not be comprised of the remnants from a low mass ( dsph ) dwarf galaxy , nor a high mass dwarf galaxy like the lmc or sgr , due to differences in chemistry .    </S>",
    "<S> the new and independent environments offered by the dsph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions related to the nucleosynthesis of the elements . </S>",
    "<S> the metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) in the dsph galaxies appear to have lower [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] than [ mg / fe ] ratios , unlike similar metallicity stars in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> predictions from the @xmath0-process ( @xmath0-rich freeze out ) would be consistent with this result if there have been a lack of hypernovae in dsph galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-process could also be responsible for the very low y abundances in the metal - poor stars in dsphs ; since [ la / eu ] ( and possibly [ ba / eu ] ) are consistent with pure r - process results , then the low [ y / eu ] suggests a separate r - process site for this light ( first peak ) r - process element . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss sne ii rates and yields as other alternatives though . in stars with higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath5 ) , contributions from the s - process </S>",
    "<S> are expected ; [ ( y , la , & ba)/eu ] all rise as expected , and yet [ ba / y ] is still much higher in the dsph stars than similar metallicity galactic stars . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with s - process contributions from lower metallicity agb stars in dsph galaxies , and is in good agreement with the slower chemical evolution expected in the low mass dsph galaxies , relative to the galaxy , such that the build up of metals occurs over much longer timescales . </S>",
    "<S> future investigations of nucleosynthetic constraints ( as well as galaxy formation and evolution ) will require an examination of many stars within individual dwarf galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the na - ni trend reported by nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) is confirmed in galactic halo stars , but discuss this in terms of the general nucleosynthesis of neutron rich elements . </S>",
    "<S> we do _ not _ confirm that the na - ni trend is related to the accretion of dsph galaxies in the galactic halo . </S>"
