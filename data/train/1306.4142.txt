    "the fractional occupation numbers @xmath0 of the correlated one - body reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) have intrigued many scientists in the past decades .",
    "they are defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath1 where the 1rdm itself is defined in terms of the usual creation and annihilation field operators as @xmath2 for a state @xmath3 where @xmath4 is space - spin coordinate .",
    "the one - particle orbitals @xmath5 in eq .   are denoted as the natural orbitals ( no ) whereas the eigenvalues @xmath0 are called the no occupation numbers . as an integral kernel",
    "the 1rdm is a bounded linear hermitian operator with an infinite but countable eigenvalue spectrum and the set of all nos form a basis in the set of quadratically integrable functions .",
    "if the state @xmath3 is fermionic it is not difficult to prove that @xmath6  @xcite . in the following we will restrict ourselves to electronic systems such that this property holds .",
    "the fact that the occupation numbers can also have non - integer values between zero and one is one of the most distinct features of interacting systems compared to non - interacting systems which can only have integer occupation numbers typically . therefore the occupation numbers reflect strongly the electronic correlations present in the system under consideration .",
    "a system is considered weakly correlating when the occupation numbers differ only slightly from zero or one , in which case the full many - electron wavefunction can well be approximated by a single slater determinant ( non - interacting wavefunction ) . if a system is strongly correlated , the occupation numbers deviate strongly from integer values and multiple determinants are required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation to the many - body wavefunction which captures the physics of the system .",
    "the ability of the 1rdm occupation numbers to signal strong correlation has encouraged people to develop 1rdm functional theory as an alternative to traditional density function theory ( dft ) to handle strongly correlated systems such as dissociating molecules  @xcite , mott insulators  @xcite and quantum hall systems  @xcite , for which the current approximate density functionals fail miserably .",
    "the sum of the occupation numbers equals the number of electrons in the system .",
    "therefore , if we order the occupation numbers , @xmath7 , from the highest to the lowest one , their values need to decay to zero sufficiently fast for @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 or even become zero after some point @xmath10 .",
    "the question whether they actually do become zero or only approach zero for @xmath8 is not only an academic question , but is also of practical interest for methods that try to build an accurate approximation to the wavefunction by making an expansion in terms of slater determinants , e.g.  configuration interactions ( ci ) .",
    "this question has recently been addressed for the dissociating hydrogen molecule  @xcite .",
    "one would expect that an optimal set of orbitals exists which leads to the fastest convergence of the expansion of the wavefunction in terms of slater determinants  @xcite .",
    "one can prove that if all determinants are taken into account ( full ci ) , that the highest occupied nos are the orbitals which give the fastest convergence towards the exact one in the @xmath11-norm  @xcite .",
    "the nos become even more interesting if the occupation numbers become all zero for @xmath12 sufficiently large , since this would imply that only a finite set of nos would already be sufficient to expand the full many - electron wavefunction .",
    "the question if zero occupation numbers exist in coulomb systems is maybe even more important for 1rdm functional theory .",
    "basic theorems in 1rdm functional theory  @xcite follow similar arguments as the famous hohenberg ",
    "kohn theorem  @xcite of density functional which establishes a one - to - one correspondence between densities , potentials and non - degenerate ground states .",
    "the main difference between 1rdm functional theory and density functional theory is that the natural conjugate variable to the 1rdm is a non - local external potential of the form @xmath13 rather than the local potential of density - functional theory .",
    "it therefore immediately follows that the energy contribution of the nonlocal external field to the total energy is given by @xmath14 with this expression the hohenberg ",
    "kohn proof can be followed exactly as in density - functional theory and gilbert  @xcite in fact did this to establish that there is a one - to - one correspondence between non - degenerate ground states @xmath3 and their corresponding 1rdm @xmath15 .",
    "this is already sufficient to establish 1rdm functional theory , since the ground state energy can be written as a functional of the 1rdm @xmath16 $ ] . in density - functional theory",
    "one can further prove that two different ( up to a gauge ) potentials can not have the same non - degenerate ground state .",
    "the analogous proof fails in 1rdm theory since there can exist nonlocal potentials @xmath17 with the property that @xmath18 for a given ground state @xmath3 of some hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "such a potential can therefore always be added to this hamiltonian without affecting the ground state ( it could be that @xmath3 is now an excited state but by multiplying @xmath17 by a small enough number we can ensure that @xmath3 is still the ground state ) .",
    "let us now see how eq .   can come about . let us first define the annihilation operator @xmath20 which annihilates the no @xmath21 from any many - body quantum state .",
    "suppose now that @xmath22 for some of the labels @xmath23 , which means that the orbital @xmath21 does not appear in any slater determinant of a ci expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 such that the corresponding no occupation number vanishes .",
    "we can then construct the following one - body potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an arbitrary hermitian matrix and where we sum only over the labels for which @xmath27 for the state @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that this potential exactly has the property @xmath28 . in real space",
    "this corresponds to a nonlocal spatial potential of the form of eq .",
    "where @xmath29 we therefore see that eq .   can be satisfied whenever the state @xmath3 has vanishing no occupations .",
    "the non - vanishing of the no occupation numbers for electronic ground states is therefore a necessary condition for the existence of a one - to - one mapping between nonlocal potentials and 1rdms . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the answer to the question whether the necessary condition is also a sufficient one is unknown .",
    "the one - to - one mapping between non - local potentials and 1rdms would be relevant for the foundations of linear response 1rdm functional theory and also its time - dependent extension would greatly benefit from the resulting simplifications .",
    "other consequences of vanishing occupation numbers arise in the extended koopmans theorem  @xcite .",
    "the extended koopmans theorem is an extension to arbitrary wavefunctions of the well known theorem by koopmans that the occupied hartree ",
    "fock orbital energies provide approximations to the ionization energies  @xcite .",
    "if the exact wavefunction is used in the extended koopmans procedure , even the exact ionization energies should result , provided the set of partially occupied nos is complete , i.e.  none of the occupation numbers vanishes .",
    "a less restrictive condition has been derived by pernal and cioslowski  @xcite , though in practice it simply implies that none of occupation numbers should vanish . for systems with coulombic interactions the extended koopmans theorem is found to hold to very high numerical accuracy  @xcite although this does not prove its validity .",
    "we have therefore seen that the possible vanishing of no occupation numbers has important consequences for ci expansions as well as for the validity of fundamental theorems in many - body theory .",
    "this then immediately raises the question in which cases the no occupation numbers vanish .",
    "if none of the occupation numbers vanishes , then every no is needed in an expansion of the ground state wave function .",
    "one general observation that one can make is that infinite expansions are typically required when expanding non - smooth functions in terms of smooth ones . in the case of electronic ground states",
    "the coulomb interaction requires the wavefunction to have a cusp at the positions where the electrons come together of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "this cusp gives an infinite kinetic energy which exactly compensates the infinity from the coulomb interaction between the electrons  @xcite . due to this non - analytic behavior of the wavefunction",
    ", a full expansion of the wavefunction in one - electron functions requires in general all functions to be present .",
    "hence , one may expect in the particular case of an expansion in nos , none of the nos should have an occupation number equal to zero , since that would imply that the no is not required in the expansion .",
    "although this argument sounds very reasonable , it is certainly not a proof that zero occupations do not occur in coulomb systems .",
    "though infinitely many occupation numbers are required to be non - zero , it might be that some of them are still zero in some special situations . in the case of the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) , however , this argument can be turned into a proof .",
    "since the nos of the heg are simply plane waves , the occupation numbers are then given by the momentum distribution , @xmath32 .",
    "kimball has shown that the momentum distribution is required to decay as @xmath33 due to the inter - electronic cusp condition  @xcite , so the occupation numbers never become exactly zero .    in the case of the heg",
    "we were in the fortunate situation that the nos are plane waves and , so that their occupation numbers are simply given by the momentum distribution . for general systems we are not in such a convenient position ,",
    "because a straightforward expansion in a finite basis set effectively smoothens the electron - electron cusp   and the argument does not apply anymore . for two - electron systems we are in a more fortunate situation , however , since for singlet two - electron systems",
    "there is a strong connection between the nos and the wavefunction .",
    "the spatial part of the singlet two - electron wavefunction is symmetric and can therefore be diagonalized @xmath34 by calculating the corresponding spin - integrated 1rdm , one readily finds that the eigenfunctions are nos and that the coefficients are related to the occupation numbers as @xmath35 .",
    "though we are not in such a good position as the for the heg , this connection is quite useful , since it allows us to connect the behavior of the occupation numbers directly to the analytic properties of the wavefunction , instead of going via the 1rdm in which much of the analytic properties are integrated out .",
    "therefore , we will focus our attention in this paper mainly to singlet two - electron systems to demonstrate how the form of the interaction determines the analytic properties of the wavefunction , which in turn dictates the asymptotic decay of the occupation numbers .",
    "before we present a general treatment for simple explicitly correlated wavefunctions , we first consider some specific examples for which we can solve the nos and coefficients explicitly or at least prove that none of the nos have a vanishing coefficient ( occupation number ) .",
    "let us first consider the simplest wavefunction with a cusp in one dimension ( 1d ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalization constant and @xmath38 is an arbitrary orbital apart from the fact that it is positive , @xmath39 . to calculate the nos and the coefficients in the spectral expansion of the wavefunction",
    ", we need to solve the following eigenvalue equation @xmath40 introducing the following function @xmath41 the eigenvalue equation can be written as @xmath42 now differentiating this equation twice with respect to @xmath43 , we obtain the following differential equation for @xmath44 @xmath45 where we used that @xmath46 . from this equation",
    "we see that @xmath47 if @xmath48 , since otherwise we would have @xmath49 which is not an eigenfunction .",
    "hence , for @xmath48 we can divide by @xmath50 and write the equation as @xmath51 where @xmath52 in the case that a simple slater function is used for the orbital , @xmath53 , the differential equation can be cast into a bessel s differential equation .",
    "the full construction of all the nos and their coefficients is rather technical and has been deferred to appendix  [ ap : modelatom ] .",
    "the result of the calculation is that none of the occupation numbers is zero and that the occupation numbers behave asymptotically as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "we will see later that such a power law behavior is typical for wave functions that are at most a finite number of times differentiable ( in our case zero times ) .",
    "let us now try to extent the approach of the previous example to a three dimensional case , so that we have a wavefunction in three dimensions ( 3d ) that satisfies the cusp condition   of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "since the nos are eigenfunctions of the wavefunction  , they satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath58 now introducing similar function as in the 1d case , @xmath59 , the eigenvalue equation can be written as @xmath60 unfortunately , just taking the laplacian does not work , since @xmath61 . taking the laplacian a second time ,",
    "however , we obtain the sought after delta function and our equation becomes @xmath62 we can now use the same argument as in the 1d case . since the orbital @xmath63 will in general",
    "not vanish on some open set , @xmath64 would imply that @xmath65 for unoccupied nos .",
    "since such orbitals are not normalizable , our simple explicitly correlated wavefunction does not have any nos with occupation numbers equal to zero .",
    "since the differential equation for the functions @xmath66 is now fourth order and additionally in 3d , it becomes quite hard to obtain the nos explicitly from this equation .",
    "in any case , it is exactly the cusp behavior that allows us to conclude that none of the no occupation numbers vanish .",
    "although we have found that the exact treatment of the cusp in the simple hylleraas wavefunction prevented the nos to have a zero occupation number , one can wonder if the electron - electron cusp is actually essential to have only non - zero occupation numbers .",
    "this is actually not the case as one can show explicitly for a system with harmonic interactions in one dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the coordinates can be decoupled by making a transformation to center - of - mass coordinates , which gives the following expression for the hamiltonian @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . since this is the hamiltonian for two independent harmonic oscillators , we can immediately write spatial part of the singlet ground state wavefunction as @xmath73{\\frac{\\omega\\,\\tilde{\\omega}}{\\pi^2}}{\\textrm{e}}^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\omega s^2 + \\tilde{\\omega}t^2 ) } \\notag \\\\ & = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{\\omega\\,\\tilde{\\omega}}{\\pi^2}}{\\textrm{e}}^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\omega x_1 ^ 2}{\\textrm{e}}^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\omega x_2 ^ 2 } \\;{\\textrm{e}}^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\tilde{\\omega}-\\omega)t^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure of this solution is sufficiently simple to determine the nos and the corresponding wavefunction coefficients explicitly . due to the purely harmonic nature of our system",
    ", one might suspect that the nos also have the form of harmonic oscillator solutions .",
    "indeed , one can actually calculate the nos to be ( see appendix  [ ap : harmnos ] ) @xmath74{\\omega\\tilde{\\omega}}\\,x\\bigr ) { \\textrm{e}}^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\omega\\tilde{\\omega}}x^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath76 normalization constants satisfying @xmath77{\\omega\\tilde{\\omega}}}{2^kk!\\sqrt{\\pi}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding wavefunction coefficients are @xmath78{\\omega\\tilde{\\omega}}}{\\sqrt{\\omega}+\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}}}\\ , ( -1)^k \\biggl(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega}-\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}}}{\\sqrt{\\omega}+\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}}}\\biggr)^k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that the wavefunction coefficients are alternating and only vanish in the limit @xmath8 . only when @xmath79 ( no interactions ) , all the coefficients become zero , except for the first one @xmath80 .",
    "an important conclusion is now that instead of a power law behavior we now have an exponential decay of the form @xmath81 with @xmath55 and @xmath82 constants",
    ". we will show below that such a behavior is typical in the limit @xmath83 for infinitely differentiable wave functions .",
    "our examples seem to indicate that there is a connection between the differentiability properties of the wave functions and the asymptotic behavior of the no occupations . in the next section",
    "we make this connection more precise .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the nos   is a fredholm integral equation , where the two - body wavefunction @xmath84 is the kernel and @xmath50 are the eigenvalues .",
    "( often one considers the characteristic values , @xmath85 , instead of the eigenvalues . ) in the theory of fredholm integral equations lower bounds on the decay rate of the eigenvalues have been established on the differentiability and analyticity of the integral kernel  @xcite .",
    "although only lower bounds have been found , these bounds are a nice illustration of the strong link between the differentiability of the kernel and the decay rate of the kernel .",
    "the first result of interest is by hille and tamarkin , who showed that the eigenvalues of operators with analytic kernels decay exponentially .",
    "more precisely @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the eigenvalues and the constant @xmath88 is related to the size of the region where the kernel is analytic  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the kernel of the double harmomium is analytic and the corresponding coefficients decay exponentially  .    a result for finitely differentiable integral kernels by weyl  @xcite is of particular interest for wavefunctions with a cusp .",
    "weyl showed that the eigenvalues of a finitely differentiable kernel only need to decay polynomially .",
    "more precisely , if the partial derivatives of a symmetric kernel are continuous up to order @xmath89 , the decay rate of its eigenvalues is bounded by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the dimension of the integration variable .",
    "a derivation of weyl s result can be found in appendix  [ ap : weyltheorem ] .",
    "let us compare weyl s theorem with the results for the simple 1d hylleraas atom ( sec .  [ sec : hylleraas1d ] ) .",
    "the first derivative of the wavefunction is already discontinuous in this case , so @xmath92 .",
    "this gives us a rather modest lower bound on the decay rate of the coefficients , comparing to the actual quadratic decay - rate @xmath93 of the coefficients ( see appendix  [ ap : modelatom ] ) .",
    "the bound by weyl can be tightened by using more regularity properties of the discontinuous derivatives of the wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "since the discontinuity is bound , the two - electron wavefunction can be put in @xmath94  @xcite which gives the lower bound @xmath95 on the decay - rate of the coefficients .",
    "though weyl s theorem does not put a very stringent constraint on the decay of the occupation numbers , it clearly demonstrates that wavefunctions with an interelectronic cusp will typically have only a polynomial decaying occupation number spectrum , whereas the occupation numbers of a wavefunction without a cusp will decay exponentially . since in a finite basis",
    "set the non - analyticity of the cusp can not be fully represented and thereby effectively smoothened , the calculated occupation numbers will always decay exponentially or faster , i.e.  too fast compared to the typical polynomial decay .",
    "this is actually not surprising , since if only a finite number of orbitals is included in the calculations , all the orbitals in the complement are automatically nos with zero occupation number .",
    "additionally , since a finite basis set representation effectively removes the cusp from the wavefunction  , the original argument that nos with vanishing occupation numbers do not exist in many - body coulomb systems , does not even apply anymore .",
    "the example with the harmonic interaction shows that the cusp actually might not be essential to prevent occupation numbers becoming zero .",
    "it seems that any correlation that requires some @xmath96 behavior that can not be expressed in a finite number of simple orbital products will probably imply the absence of unoccupied nos .",
    "we can make this idea more precise in the case of a singlet two - electron system which is limited to the form of a simple orbital product times an arbitrary correlation function depending only on @xmath97 , i.e.  a wavefunction of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "considering the situation that an no , @xmath100 , has a zero occupation number ( so also @xmath101 ) , the eigenvalue equation   then simplifies to @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "since this condition has the form of a convolution product , we can deconvolute it by taking the fourier transform @xmath104 provided that @xmath105 almost everywhere , it follows that @xmath106 . since @xmath107 almost everywhere",
    ", this implies that the no @xmath108 . because this is not a normalizable function , we can conclude that no eigenvalues @xmath101 exist , if @xmath105 almost everywhere",
    ".    the converse also holds .",
    "if @xmath109 on some finite interval , an no with zero occupancy exists by construction . to construct this no , define a @xmath110 which is non - zero on this interval where @xmath111 vanishes",
    ". by fourier transforming back",
    ", we can construct the corresponding no ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "since this will be a function in the null - space of the ( linear ) 1rdm - operator , it can not be expressed linear combination of nos with finite occupancy .",
    "let us show this more explicitly .",
    "suppose that such a linear combination exists , then we write the new no as @xmath113 since the 1rdm - operator is linear , we can write its action on @xmath114 as @xmath115{\\sum_{i\\in \\{i : n_i \\neq 0\\}}}{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\:{\\mathrm{d}}{{{\\mathbf{r}}}'}\\:}\\gamma({{\\mathbf{r}}},{{\\mathbf{r}}}')\\phi_i({{\\mathbf{r}}}')b_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "if we now take the inner product of this result with @xmath114 , we find @xmath116 hence , we have a contradiction , so the constructed no with zero occupation number can not be expressed as a linear combination of the nos with a finite occupancy .",
    "now let us check if our proof indeed recovers the result that our previous examples do not have vanishing occupation numbers . in the case of the harmonium",
    "the correlation function is simply a gaussian .",
    "since the fourier transform of a gaussian is simply again a gaussian , the fourier transform is non - zero every where .",
    "hence , no unoccupied nos should exist , which is in agreement with our explicit construction .",
    "the situation is more complicate in the case of the simple hylleraas wavefunction .",
    "the correlation function is not an @xmath11 function anymore , so we can expect distributions to appear in its fourier transform  . ] .",
    "note that a divergent correlation function is allowed , provided the divergence of the correlation function is compensated by a stronger decay of the orbital @xmath63 , to make the wavefunction normalizable .",

    "now let us apply the theorem to some other systems .",
    "first we will consider a system with inverse harmonic interactions which has been considered before by morrison et al .",
    "the inverse harmonic interaction is also sometimes referred to as the calogero interaction  @xcite .",
    "the full hamiltonian we will consider here is given as @xmath119 the eigenstates of this hamiltonian can be solved exactly by making a transformation to the centre - of - mass coordinates , which decouples the coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian for the centre - of - mass coordinate is simply the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator , so is readily solved .",
    "the hamiltonian for the relative coordinate is more involved , but can still be solved in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the ground state reduces to the following particularly simple form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the gamma function and @xmath122   in the exponent seems to be missing in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "this error propagates throughout the article . ] .",
    "since the ground state is simply the product of an orbital , @xmath123 , times a correlation function , @xmath124 , our theorem can be applied to this case . for the fourier transform of the correlation function",
    "we find ( see appendix  [ ap : fouriers ] for details ) @xmath125(k ) \\\\ = -\\frac{4\\pi}{k } \\times \\begin{cases } \\pi(-1)^{\\alpha/2}\\delta^{(1+\\alpha)}(k )                 & \\text{even $ \\alpha$ } \\\\",
    "\\dfrac{\\gamma(2 + \\alpha)\\sin(\\pi\\alpha/2)}{k^{2+\\alpha } }    & \\text{otherwise } , \\end{cases}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 denotes the @xmath127 order derivative of the delta - function .",
    "therefore , we find that zero occupation numbers can only exist for even @xmath128 , which is in agreement with the findings of morisson et al .",
    "actually , it is not surprising that there are only a finite number of unoccupied nos for even @xmath128 , since in that case the correlation function becomes exactly separable in @xmath129 and @xmath130 , so the wavefunction can be represented by a finite number of orbitals . for example in the simplest non - trivial case of @xmath131 the wavefunction can be written as @xmath132,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath133 as a compact notation for the various one - particle functions .",
    "since only five orbitals are required to represent this wavefunction , only five nos with non - zero occupation number exist .",
    "we see that the contribution from the @xmath89 orbitals to the wavefunction is already diagonal , so to obtain the nos , we only need to normalize them @xmath134 and we have similar expressions for @xmath135 and @xmath136 of course  . their coefficient in the spectral expansion   is readily obtained as @xmath137 . the contribution from the other two orbitals @xmath138 and @xmath139 is not diagonal , so has to be diagonalized .",
    "this is readily achieved by the following linear combinations @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "the orbitals @xmath142 are constructed such that they are orthonormal , so they are the required nos .",
    "their corresponding expansion coefficients can be calculated to be @xmath143 .",
    "this example clearly demonstrates that the cusp is actually not essential for the absence of unoccupied nos .",
    "the absence of zero occupation numbers is caused by correlation in the full many - body wavefunction , which can not be expanded in a finite series of one - electron functions .",
    "the cusp actually causes the exact wavefunction to have such a form , hence there will be an infinite amount of non - zero occupation numbers .      in this section",
    "we will apply our theorem to hooke s atom .",
    "the interaction is now the coulomb interaction , the interaction of interest for electrons .",
    "however , the confining potential is still harmonic to allow for the separation of variables by changing the coordinates to the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the hamiltonian is given as @xmath144 the ground state has the following form @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a normalization constant .",
    "the function @xmath147 satisfies the following differential equation  @xcite for the ground state @xmath148 where @xmath149 with @xmath150 as the contribution to the energy from the relative coordinate ( the total energy is @xmath151 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this differential equation does not allow for an explicit solution , though a series solution can be constructed which even has only a finite number of terms for specific ratios @xmath152 .",
    "more importantly , by neglecting the second order derivative and the last term , we readily find that the solution has to behave asymptotically for large @xmath153 as @xmath154 so at least its fourier transform exists as a distribution and in particular its laplace transform @xmath155(s ) { \\coloneqq}{\\int^{\\mathrlap{\\infty}}_{\\mathrlap{0}}{\\mathrm{d}}{\\rho}\\,}{\\textrm{e}}^{-s\\rho}t(\\rho)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] exists .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath147 can be transformed into the following differential equation for the laplace transform @xmath156 where we used that @xmath157 .",
    "the fourier transform of the correlation function can now directly be obtained from @xmath158 as @xmath159(k ) & = \\frac{2\\pi { \\textrm{i}}}{k}\\lim_{\\sigma \\to 0^+}\\left(\\tilde{t}(\\sigma+{\\textrm{i}}k ) - \\tilde{t}(\\sigma-{\\textrm{i}}k)\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the limits are important to include possible poles at the origin .",
    "since the laplace transform is a solution of a second order differential equation , it has to be an analytic function .",
    "this analyticity is carried over to the fourier transform except for some possible irregularities located at the origin ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "since an analytic function can only be zero in an open set if it vanishes everywhere , the fourier transform of the correlation function of the hookium atom does not vanish in a finite region and hence , the no coefficients ( occupation numbers ) do not vanish for the hookium atom .    -channel .",
    "in the weak correlation regime ( large @xmath161 ) only the highest occupied no has a positive coefficient and all the other nos have a negative coefficient . in the strongly correlated regime ( small @xmath161 )",
    "the signs of the no are alternating .",
    "in the color version the sign of the corresponding coefficient has been coded as black for positive and red for negative . ]",
    "this result is orthogonal to the claim made by cioslowski and pernal  @xcite .",
    "they have studied the behavior of the wavefunction coefficients of hooke s atom numerically and found that the coefficients become very small and that the sign pattern of the most significant coefficients around these points change .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the expansion coefficients have to become zero to change their sign . as a courtesy to the reader , we have repeated their calculations to obtain an accurate expression for the wavefunction and calculated the no coefficients by diagonalizing the wavefunction directly . the results for the occupation numbers in the @xmath23-channel",

    "however , the presence of unoccupied nos will cause complications in the formal developments of 1rdm functional theory . for the extended koopmans theorem",

    "<S> the non - vanishing of the natural orbital occupation numbers of the one - particle density matrix of many - body systems has important consequences for the existence of a density matrix - potential mapping for nonlocal potentials in reduced density matrix functional theory and for the validity of the extended koopmans theorem . on the basis of weyl s theorem </S>",
    "<S> we give a connection between the differentiability properties of the ground state wave function and the rate at which the natural occupations approach zero when ordered as a descending series . </S>",
    "<S> we show , in particular , that the presence of a coulomb cusp in the wave function leads , in general , to a power law decay of the natural occupations , whereas infinitely differentiable wave - functions typically have natural occupations that decay exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze for a number of explicit examples of two - particle systems that in case the wave function is non - analytic at its spatial diagonal ( for instance , due to the presence of a coulomb cusp ) the natural orbital occupations are non - vanishing . </S>",
    "<S> we further derive a more general criterium for the non - vanishing of no occupations for two - particle wave functions with a certain separability structure . on the basis of this criterium </S>",
    "<S> we show that for a two - particle system of harmonically confined electrons with a coulombic interaction ( the so - called hookium ) the natural orbital occupations never vanish . </S>"
