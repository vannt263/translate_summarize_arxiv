    "@xcite notes that the statement of this problem is formulated in terms of classical euclidean elementary geometry ( ceeg ) but danielsson s proof is based on some intricate projective geometry .",
    "this poses a challenge to prove inequality using only methods belonging to ceeg . in this article",
    "we prove the grace - danielsson inequality without the explicit use of any geometry at all ; instead we use a tool from quantum mechanics called the _ steering ellipsoid _  @xcite .",
    "we begin by outlining the theory behind steering ellipsoids . by understanding the separability of two - qubit states in the formalism , we derive a single key inequality that applies to both the 2- and 3-dimensional scenarios ( theorem [ keyinequality ] ) . from this inequality the results and easily follow ( corollaries [ circle ] and [ sphere ] respectively ) .",
    "moreover , our inequality can be used to give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a nested triangle ( tetrahedron ) in the general case that @xmath7 is an ellipse ( ellipsoid ) .",

    "we give an example of how it might be used for ellipsoids in corollary [ ellipsoid ] .",

    "there already exist some physically motivated derivations of geometric results ; for example , the generalised parallel axes theorem can be used to prove properties of triangle centres such as euler s formula @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "our derivation is particularly remarkable since it gives a new generalisation as well as recovering a result that remains unproven using ceeg",
    ".    finally , we note that this work has led to renewed interest in the @xmath11-dimensional scenario , with egan conjecturing @xmath16 to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of a nested simplex  @xcite .",
    "although sufficiency of this condition has been proven , there is not yet a proof of its necessity .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the steering ellipsoid formalism and its significance within the broad field of quantum information theory .",
    "quantum information theory studies how quantum mechanics can be exploited to process information in ways that can not be achieved using classical physics  @xcite .",
    "the basic unit is a _ qubit _ , the quantum mechanical analogue of a classical bit of data . a central concept in quantum information is the phenomenon of entanglement .",
    "this describes a form of non - classical correlation between physically separated systems and has for a long time been a major curiosity in the foundations of physics .",
    "more recently , entanglement has been recognised as a powerful resource for many quantum information processing tasks , including quantum computing .",
    "any quantum system is associated with a complex hilbert space @xmath17 ( a complete vector space equipped with an inner product ) .",
    "the _ state _ of the quantum system is described by a linear operator @xmath18 acting on @xmath17 . by definition",
    ", @xmath18 must be unit trace and positive semi - definite ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a single qubit corresponds to @xmath20 ; the associated state @xmath18 is given by a @xmath21 hermitian matrix .",
    "we can express this as @xmath22 in the pauli basis @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a real 3-dimensional _ bloch vector_. the constraint @xmath26 is equivalent to the condition @xmath27 .",
    "thus any single qubit state can be represented by a bloch vector inside the unit sphere ( _ bloch sphere _ ) , which we denote @xmath28 .",
    "two qubits are fundamentally important for studying quantum correlations as they form the simplest system that can exhibit entanglement .",
    "a two - qubit system has a state @xmath18 acting on @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the tensor product . in this case",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to a @xmath31 hermitian matrix that can be described using 15 real parameters .",
    "the steering ellipsoid formalism was developed as a method for representing any such two - qubit state using a set of 3-dimensional objects that can be easily visualised  @xcite .    for our purposes",
    "it suffices to focus on a restricted set of so - called _ canonical _ two - qubit states .",

    "the bloch vector representing alice s qubit is @xmath34 and the bloch vector representing bob s qubit is @xmath35 .",
    "however , the two bloch vectors alone do not fully describe @xmath18 : there is also a real @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 that describes correlations between alice and bob .",
    "the effect of these correlations is manifest when bob performs a quantum measurement on his qubit .",
    "bob s measurement is described by a set of @xmath11 operators @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath41 ; on obtaining measurement outcome @xmath42 , the two - qubit state @xmath18 is _ collapsed _ according to @xmath43 .",
    "when this measurement - induced collapse occurs , the bloch vector representing alice s qubit is changed . by choosing which measurement to perform",
    ", bob can thus _",
    "steer _ alice .",
    "given all possible measurements by bob , the set of bloch vectors to which alice can be steered forms an ellipsoid inside the bloch sphere @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "this is alice s steering ellipsoid , which we denote @xmath7 .",
    "the centre of @xmath7 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath28 is centred at the origin , the distance between the centres of @xmath7 and @xmath28 is @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the real @xmath45 symmetric matrix @xmath46 correspond to the squared lengths of the ellipsoid semiaxes ; the eigenvectors of @xmath47 give the orientation of these axes . that @xmath7 is contained",
    "inside @xmath28 is necessary but not sufficient to meet the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "note also that @xmath7 could be a degenerate ellipsoid ( i.e. an ellipse , line or point ) , corresponding to @xmath47 being rank deficient .",
    "steering ellipsoids give a new geometric perspective on two - qubit entanglement in the form of the _ nested tetrahedron condition _",
    "any two - qubit state @xmath18 that is not entangled is described as separable and may be decomposed into @xmath48 terms as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are single qubit states and @xmath51 is a probability distribution  @xcite .",

    "that @xmath7 is an ellipse , poncelet s porism can be used to show that if there exists a tetrahedron nested between @xmath7 and @xmath28 then there must also exist a triangle nested between @xmath7 and @xmath28  @xcite .    independently of the nested tetrahedron condition we can also formulate an algebraic condition for separability .",
    "define @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the usual matrix transposition map .",
    "for a two - qubit state we write @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath21 matrices ; then @xmath57 . using the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the condition @xmath58 is necessary and sufficient for separability and @xmath59  as required , these are unit trace and positive semi - definite .",
    "we find @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    ", this determinant can easily be evaluated in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "a canonical state @xmath18 is seen to be separable if and only if @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with unit vector @xmath69 .",
    "we thus have two equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for the separability of @xmath18 : the nested tetrahedron condition and inequality .",
    "it is not at all obvious how either one of these conditions could be found directly from the other .",
    "crucially , however , we now have an algebraic formulation for the existence of a nested tetrahedron . converting the unit sphere @xmath28 to a sphere @xmath8 of radius @xmath1",
    ", we arrive at the key inequality that will be used to derive all our results in 2 and 3 dimensions .",
