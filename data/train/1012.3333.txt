    "besides , they suggested that these outflows could derive their energy directly from the accretion power .",
    "this would be also consistent with the fact that accreting ctts seem to have on average longer rotation periods than their non - accreting counterparts ( weak - lined t  tauri stars , wtts ) , indicating a connection between spin - down and accretion @xcite .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the accretion power is liberated in a shock due to the impact of the accretion streams with the stellar surface .",
    "while a fraction of the accretion energy can be converted ( e.g. into alfvn waves , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possibly injected into the wind , the emission of the shocked material can explain the observed optical excess and uv continuum @xcite .",
    "observations of the accretion shock luminosity can be therefore used to constrain the accretion energy which is available to power the stellar wind .    in this letter",
    "we try to estimate the spin - down efficiency and the energy requirement of accretion powered stellar winds ( apsw ) compatible with measurements of magnetic fields and accretion luminosities of several ctts . in section [ sec : model ] we describe a simple analytical apsw model and we apply it to a specific ctts example in section [ sec : bp ] . we determine the stellar parameters which are compatible with a spin equilibrium situation in section [ sec : spin ] and we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : dicsussion ] .",
    "in our analysis we will assume that , even in the case of a multipolar , complex stellar field , the dipolar component controls the dynamics of both accretion ( i.e. the disk truncation radius ) and ejection ( i.e. the wind magnetic lever arm ) .",
    "this assumption is somewhat supported by the results of @xcite : in the case of a multipolar field ( quadrupolar in their case ) with no dipolar component , the stellar wind torque is strongly suppressed .",

    "how much energy is necessary to drive such a stellar wind ?",
    "since ctts rotate well below their break - up speed ( @xmath40 ) , magneto - centrifugal processes are not efficient enough to accelerate the wind at the stellar surface and an extra energy input is required to give to the wind the initial drive .",
    "this energy input corresponds roughly to a specific energy of the order of the potential gravitational energy : @xmath41 . in the apsw scenario",

    "this translates into a simplified formula like @xmath47 , with @xmath48 a numerical factor of order unity ( e.g. @xmath49 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reflecting the uncertainty on the position of the truncation radius .",
    "this determines a possible discrepancy between the observed accretion rate @xmath50 and the real one @xmath27 .",
    "we try now to apply this simple model to some ctts observations .",

    "we also take into account a taurus - auriga sample from @xcite : for these stars the average magnetic field has been measured ( @xmath51 1 - 3 kg ) , but the actual intensity of their dipolar component is unknown .",
    "taking as an example the specific case of bp  tau , we assume the following values : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 g , @xmath55 d , @xmath56 @xcite .",

    "therefore , in the bp  tau case , a spin equilibrium situation ( @xmath36 ) is only compatible with an accretion luminosity smaller than @xmath59 .",
