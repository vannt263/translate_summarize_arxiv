    "the astounding range of experimental and theoretical studies performed on carbon nanotubes  @xcite has revealed a spectrum of physics characteristic of strongly correlated low - dimensional electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "the underlying graphene lattice structure of these tubes uniquely affects band structure , effective dimensionality , coulomb interaction effects , and the quantum dot behavior exhibited by short nanotube segments .",
    "the band structure shows differing behavior depending on various factors such as chirality , applied gate potentials , boundary conditions at the tube ends and mechanical stress  @xcite . in single - walled armchair nanotubes ( swnt )",
    "@xcite , which are the entities of interest here , gapless linearly dispersing modes endow the nanotube with its peculiar quantum wire properties . as described theoretically and ascertained experimentally , interactions within the modes of this effectively one - dimensional system",
    "cause it to behave as a luttinger liquid characterized by non - ohmic conductances  @xcite .",
    "tubes placed between tunnel barriers act as quantum dots  @xcite , which , while displaying zero dimensional physics such as coulomb blockade behavior , retain some higher dimensional traits such as hosting plasmons typical of one dimension and band degrees of freedom attributed to the underlying graphene lattice .",
    "potentially invaluable to applications , these nanotube quantum dots have been proposed as elements of quantum devices and the quantum states of blockaded electrons have been regarded as candidates for units of quantum information  @xcite . in each of these aspects , the presence of applied fields",
    "can dramatically alter the nanotube s behavior ; here we present an extensive study of the effects of electric and magnetic fields applied transversally to the axis of the nanotube .    at the level of the band structure , it has been shown that a parallel magnetic field can have the striking effect of converting a metallic tube to a semiconducting one by way of inducing a gap  @xcite , and vice - versa , an effect discernible in conductance , coulomb blockade and scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) measurements . here , instead of a parallel field",
    ", we discuss transverse field configurations ( both electric and magnetic ) and the conditions under which a band gap opens up or the spectrum remains gapless in armchair swnts . in the latter case , we demonstrate , via band - structure calculations , simultaneous breaking of the valley degeneracy ( of the two distinct dirac points ) , the left - right - mover degeneracy , and the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "moreover , the fields yield a non - negligible reduction in the fermi velocity of conduction electrons traveling along the tube .",
    "we show that for certain configurations of fields , the ground state of the tube can even be made to carry finite current .",
    "transverse fields provide an excellent means of altering the ratio of interaction strength to the fermi energy in swnts .",
    "this makes nanotubes potentially the only systems to date in which the associated luttinger liquid physics can be tuned in a controlled fashion .",
    "as described in previous work , either an electric field  @xcite or a magnetic field  @xcite alone suffices to change the value of the luttinger liquid parameter from that measured in field - free environments . the magnitude of the electric fields required to bring about a significant change are well within current experimental reach @xcite . here , we find that our approach reproduces these results .",
    "we show that such a tuning of luttinger parameters can mediate a transition from the system showing tendencies towards spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ordering to that of charge - density - wave ( cdw ) ordering .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the tuning of the luttinger parameter presented in previous works for the net charge density  @xcite , we find that luttinger - type interactions become manifest in modes associated with the density differences between nanotube bands as well .",
    "thus we predict that akin to spin - charge separation , transverse fields can induce a spin - charge - band separation wherein the three degrees of freedom move at different velocities .",
    "the above results are discussed in the case of an infinite system . for short tubes or finite length segments formed by tunnel barriers ,",
    "boundary effects need to be taken into account .",
    "we find that applied fields influence multiple aspects of short nanotubes .",
    "first , fields can alter the single - particle energy level spacing of the tube . here",
    ", we carefully account for the effect of the tube ends in the case that the left and right movers travel at different speeds .",
    "second , the charging energies become field dependent , and third , the plasmon spectrum varies in accordance with the first two effects .",
    "we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the short nanotube as a finite - sized luttinger liquid and show how all three effects can be captured . within this description ,",
    "we discuss the structure of field - dependent coulomb blockade peaks and how the presence of both electric and magnetic fields acts as a means of manipulating quantum states of the dot ( the effect of a magnetic field alone has recently been discussed by bellucci and onorato  @xcite ) .    ) and electric fields .",

    "indeed the asymmetry of the velocity in the right- and left - moving branches is expected from a elementary consideration . for a charge particle moving on a smooth cylinder in the presence of mutually perpendicular transverse magnetic and electric fields",
    ", the direction of the force caused by the magnetic field depends on whether the particle is moving along the tube in one direction or another , whereas the electric field remains the same .",
    "hence , for fixed kinetic energy , the force in the transverse direction causing the particle to spiral is different for different directions of motion , and giving rise to different velocities along the axial direction .",

    "now , in a nanotube , gaps can arise for different reasons .",
    "for example , the gap associated with a semiconducting tube occurs because the quantized bands miss the dirac point of the underlying graphene lattice .",
    "such a gap can be closed by applying a magnetic field ( of a specific strength ) parallel to the tube s axis . in the present case however , the gap arises from an energy difference associated with the two sublattices and therefore can not be so closed . not surprisingly , the gap described here vanishes precisely when the electric and magnetic forces on a classical charged particle traveling along the tube are either parallel or antiparallel .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrumvbn ] and  [ fig : spectrumvb ] we clearly see that as the angle between the fields varies , the particle - hole symmetry and the valley degeneracy , as well as the symmetry between left- and right - moving spectra , are broken .",
    "the degree of breaking of these symmetries is greatest in the case that the fields are perpendicular . on the other hand ,",
    "these symmetries are preserved when the fields are parallel or anti - parallel and the gap is at its maximum .",
    "this angle - dependent gap can be manifest in the transport measurement , e.g. , the conductance can be @xmath96 , or @xmath97 or zero , depending on whether there are @xmath98 , @xmath99 or zero conducting channels ( including spin ) .      in order to study the low - energy physics of electronic excitations about the fermi energy for all the cases described above",

    "the bloch wavefunction @xmath104 retains detailed information about the response of the electronic wave functions to the applied fields @xcite . while the sublattice basis ( indexed by @xmath105 ) is convenient for discussing these wavefunctions , it does not diagonalize the hopping interaction .",
    "we therefore transform to the right and left moving basis ( @xmath106 ) via the transformation @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this gives a kinetic energy term @xmath109 where , as shown above a generic field configuration can give rise to the possibility that @xmath110 .",

( [ eq : gap ] ) ] can be incorporated into our hamiltonian by a mass term @xmath111 note that this mass term is of a different form than that considered in the exhaustive zero - field study by egger et al.@xcite ( which had the form @xmath112 ) .",
    "similarly , the effect of the shift associated with the fermi points can be described by the term @xmath113",

    "@xcite whose lucid pedagogical exposition we do not repeat but instead confine our discussion to the new field - dependant features .",
    "the presence of fields does not alter the fact that the electrons on a tube are locked into their lowest energy radial mode .",
    "hence , it is possible to study the low energy excitations in the presence of interactions using an effective bosonized 1d hamiltonian .",
    "bosonization offers a great simplification since many of the quartic interaction terms in the fermionic language become quadratic once they are bosonized .",
