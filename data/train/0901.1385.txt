    "m33 , the nearest scd galaxy at a distance of 840kpc , with its large angular size and medium inclination , allows determination of the magnetic field components both parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight equally well .",
    "the rm studies of m33 by @xcite and @xcite suggested a bisymmetric regular magnetic field structure in the disk of m33 .",
    "however , due to the low - resolution ( 1.8kpc ) and low - sensitivity of their observations , these results were affected by high uncertainty particularly in the southern half of m33 .",
    "our recent observations of this galaxy provide high - resolution ( 0.7kpc ) maps of total power and linearly polarized intensity at 3.6 cm , 6.2 cm , and 20 cm presented by @xcite .",
    "these data are ideal to study the rotation measure ( rm ) , the structure and strength of the magnetic field , and depolarization effects in detail . by combining an analysis of multi - wavelength polarization angles with modeling of the wavelength - dependent depolarization , @xcite and @xcite derived the 3-d regular magnetic field structures in m31 and m51 , respectively .",
    "the high sensitivity of our new observations allows a similar study for m33 .",
    "using the polarized intensity maps of @xcite and the nonthermal maps obtained by @xcite , we derived maps of the nonthermal degree of polarization at different wavelengths . integrating the polarized and nonthermal intensity maps in the galactic plane out to a galactocentric radius of r  @xmath2  7.5  kpc",
    ", we obtained the flux densities of the nonthermal and linearly polarized emission and the average nonthermal degrees of polarization of 10.3%@xmath32.0% , 11.3%@xmath31.9% , and 6.6%@xmath30.6% at 3.6 cm , 6.2 cm , and 20 cm , respectively , indicating considerable wavelength - dependent depolarization by faraday effects at 20 cm .",
    "in order to identify the 3-d structure of the _ regular _ magnetic field @xmath4 we fit a parameterized model of @xmath5 to the observed polarization angles at different wavelengths .",
    "we find that the fourier modes @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the first and second fourier modes of the vertical field ) in the 13 kpc ring and @xmath9 in the 35 kpc ring can best reproduce the observed pattern of polarized intensity at 6.2 cm ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the horizontal magnetic field component follows an arm - like pattern with pitch angles smaller than those of the optical arm segments , indicating that large - scale gas - dynamical effects such as compression and shear are not solely responsible for the spiral magnetic lines .",
    "the dominant axisymmetric mode ( @xmath10 ) in the disk in both rings indicates that galactic dynamo action is present in m33 .",
    "we also find that the fitted ` vertical field ' , in the outer ring , could be mainly due to the severe warp of m33 and hence apparent .",
    "however , a real vertical field of a broadly comparable strength to the disk field can exist in the inner ring .",
    "the strengths of the total magnetic field @xmath11 and its regular component @xmath4 can be found from the total synchrotron intensity and its degree of linear polarization .",
    "assuming equipartition between the energy densities of the magnetic field and cosmic rays leads to @xmath12 g and @xmath13 g for the disk of m33 ( @xmath147.5kpc ) .",
    "the energy densities of the equipartition magnetic fields in the disk ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the total and regular magnetic fields , respectively ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "the energy densities of the magnetic field and turbulence are about the same , confirming the theory of generation of interstellar magnetic fields from turbulent gas motion .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the ism in m33 can be characterized by a low-@xmath17 plasma and is dominated by supersonic turbulence , as the energy densities of the magnetic field and turbulence are both much higher than the thermal energy density ."
