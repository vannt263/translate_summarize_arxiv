    "bulk iron undergoes a structural transition from a face centered cubic ( fcc ) high - temperature phase to a low - temperature body centered cubic ( bcc ) phase , which is ferromagentic with a curie temperature of 1043k .",
    "the structural transition temperature is systematically lowered by alloying elements from the right side of fe in the periodic table , which effectively lowers the valence electron concentration @xmath6 .",
    "the transition is displacive and diffusionless between a high - temperature high - symmetry austenitic phase and a low - temperature martensitic phase , in which the symmetry is usually lowered , e.g. , by tetragonal distortions . in ferromagnetic fe - alloys with @xmath6 between 8.7 and 8.5 ,",
    "the martensitic transition disappears and fcc austenite becomes the stable ground state structure .",
    "iron alloys with ni - group elements at this valence electron concentration are at the center of scientific interest for a long time , as they show , in addition to the martensitic instability , a multitude of magneto - structural anomalies that are of technological importance .",
    "the probably most prominent is the so - called invar effect , describing the over - compensation of thermal expansion in a wide temperature range , which has been intensively studied for more than one century.@xcite the best known representative is fe@xmath7ni@xmath8 , but similar behavior is also observed in fe@xmath9pd@xmath10 and fe@xmath11pt@xmath12 .",
    "although most explanations proposed so far rely on magneto - volume coupling , the vicinity to the martensitic transformation has been well noticed and discussed .",
    "the relevant literature on this topic is too numerous to be summarized at this point  for an introduction and further references , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "during the past three decades , the so - called magnetic shape memory ( msm ) effect , which is again present in the alloys with all three ni - group elements , was brought to the attention of the scientific community .",
    "the msm behavior allows very large magnetic - field - induced strains of up to three percent to be achieved by externally applying moderate magnetic fields in the ( sub-)tesla range.@xcite the effect is not as pronounced as for the ni - based heusler alloys like ni@xmath3mnga,@xcite but its origin is believed to be related .",
    "one common key ingredient is the appearance of intermediate or modulated martensites  5-fold and 10-fold modulated pseudo - tetragonal or orthohombic in the case of ni - mn - ga@xcite and ( slightly distorted ) face centered tetragonal ( fct ) in the case of fe - pt and fe - pd  between the high symmetry austenite and the low - temperature martensite , which is body centered tetragonal in the case of the ferrous alloys.@xcite    for the above mentioned alloys , the relevant electron concentration range is achieved at compositions which may allow the formation of ordered stoichiometric compounds .",
    "however , fe@xmath5pt is the only alloy where the ordered phase is reproducibly realized in experiment .",
    "nevertheless , measurements are predominately made for slightly off - stoichiometric ordered fe@xmath13pt@xmath14 which does not transform martensitically , even if order is not fully complete .",
    "therefore , most data are available only for disordered or partially ordered alloys . despite this fact",
    ", we will restrict our study to stoichiometric , ordered compounds .",
    "these are much easier to handle from the technical point of view and allow deeper insight into electronic and vibrational properties with respect to their physical origin , because their simulation cells are sufficiently small while side - effects as statistical broadening can be largely avoided .",
    "another important feature of these alloys is the marked softening of the transversal acoustic phonons in [ 110 ] direction , which has subsequently been related to any of the three above mentioned anomalies in the past.@xcite our central aim is thus to investigate the influence of electron - phonon coupling in fe@xmath5ni , fe@xmath5pd and fe@xmath5pt as one of the important mechanisms for structural transformations of fe - based binary alloys .",
    "this complements the experimental information by providing a link between electronic properties and structural distortions , which will help to clarify the microscopic origin of these instabilities .",
    "we accomplished this aim by comparing features of the phonon dispersion with the electronic structure of these alloys .",
    "a similar approach has been used in the past to explore the nature of electron - phonon coupling in conventional and magnetic shape memory alloys.@xcite     ( a ) and d0@xmath4 ( b ) ordered alloys of @xmath15 stoichiometry as used in our calculations .",
    "the lower two images show both structures represented in the same supercell which consists of two primitive cells stacked along the @xmath16-axis in the case of l2@xmath17 ( c ) . exchanging the @xmath18 and @xmath19 components ( marked by dark blue and bright orange spheres ) in one of the @xmath20-@xmath21-planes",
    "yields the d0@xmath4 ordering ( d ) .",
    "note , that the symmetry of the d0@xmath4 structure is tetragonal .",
    "after reduction of the @xmath22-ratio by a factor of @xmath23 , the cell transforms to the bcc - type d0@xmath5 structure with cubic symmetry .",
    ", width=226 ]    during our preoccupation with this topic , we noticed that investigations providing a structural and dynamical view of the field on the basis of first principles calculations are sparse and performed with varying methodology , hindering a comparison of all three isoelectronic alloys on equal footing .",
    "we therefore decided to provide first a systematic survey of structural properties and lattice dynamics of ordered fe - rich alloys with elements of the ni - group , thereby filling the above mentioned gap in existing literature .",
    "the experimentally observed order in fe@xmath5pt is of l1@xmath3 type , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] . in our calculations",
    ", we will alternatively consider d0@xmath4 order",
    ". for lattices with bcc coordination d0@xmath4 becomes equivalent with d0@xmath5 order , which is related to the l2@xmath17 structure of ternary heusler alloys .",
    "fe - rich fe - pd and fe - pt alloys close to the stoichiometric composition are reported to be collinear ferromagnets at low temperatures ; we will therefore solely concentrate on the collinear ferromagnetic case .",
    "excited non - collinear , ferri- and antiferromagnetic spin structures , which have been discussed with respect to the invar effect,@xcite would certainly be beneficial for a thorough understanding of the interdependence of lattice dynamics and finite temperature anomalies as msm and invar effect .",
    "these , however , are beyond the scope of the current work and are thus left open for future investigation .",

    "@xcite this code concentrates  as pseudopotential methods generally do  for efficiency reasons on the valence electrons for the description of the electronic structure .",
    "the vasp code provides , nevertheless , an excellent compromise between speed and accuracy as the interaction with core electrons is taken into account within the projector augmented wave approach ( paw).@xcite this yields results close to what is usually expected from other all electron methods . as we are dealing with fe - rich compositions ,",
    "the use of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is mandatory to obtain a correct description of the structural ground state properties . for structural energies within small ( four atom ) cells corresponding to fig .",

    "the brillouin zone integration was carried out using the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections.@xcite electronic self - consistency was assumed below a threshold difference of @xmath28ev between two iteration .",
    "the vasp code is supplied with an extensive , well tested potential library which contains more than one pre - generated pseudopotential per element .",
    "these differ by number of electrons explicitly treated as valence or semi - core states or are designed for different exchange correlation functionals . in our case ,",
    "the gga formulations of perdew and wang ( pw91 ) in connection with the spin - interpolation formula of vosko , wilk and nusair as well as perdew burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) have been used.@xcite the required cutoff of the plane wave basis depends on the exchange correlation potential and was chosen as e@xmath29ev ( or larger ) for pw91 and pbe together with the minimal basis explicitly describing the @xmath30 for fe and @xmath31 for pd ( and correspondingly for ni and pt ) . in calculations",
    "explicitely considering the semi - core @xmath32-electrons , e@xmath33 was set to @xmath34ev for pbe and @xmath35ev for the pw91 pseudopotentials .",
    "a scalar relativistic formulation of the hamiltonian was used throughout.@xcite      although the above mentioned technical differences with respect to the choice of the exchange correlation functional and the basis size usually do not lead to qualitative changes of the results , we must be particularly careful in our case , because energy landscapes in the vicinity of a structural transformation can be essentially flat .",
    "this requires a higher accuracy , i.e. , a better energy resolution .",
    "therefore , we decided to perform in a first step a thorough comparison of the available potentials . as a benchmark",
    ", we evaluated the energy as a function of the tetragonal distortion @xmath22 along the bain path@xcite for l1@xmath3 ordered fe@xmath5pd , describing a structural deformation from a face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice at @xmath36 to a body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice at @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vaspwien ] .",
    "the results were compared to high precision calculations using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) as implemented within wien2k code,@xcite which is widely counted among the most accurate dft codes for solid state problems . here , the calculations included @xmath38 and @xmath39 of iron and @xmath40 and @xmath41 of palladium as semi - core .",
    "the energetic cut - off was chosen as @xmath42@xmath27@xmath43@xmath29.0 .",
    "muffin - tin radii of 2.24 a.u .",
    "were used for all atoms and angular momenta were taken into account up to @xmath44@xmath210 .",
    "the @xmath26-mesh comprised again 32000@xmath26-points@xmath27atoms in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the obtained energy variation along the bain path is with @xmath45mev / atom very small .",
    "however , except for the pbe potentials without semi - core @xmath32 electrons , all curves coincide within an energy interval of 2@xmath463mev / atom ( 23@xmath4735k on a temperature scale ) , which can be taken as a measure for the methodological resolution in calculating structural energy differences along the bain path .",
    "while the pbe potentials seem to systematically overestimate the energy variation ( slightly ) , the agreement between both pw91 potentials ( large and small basis ) and the full potential curves is very good .",
    "this finding agrees well with a recent comparison of experimental and theoretical structural data for equiatomic fept alloys.@xcite our benchmark demonstrates that the pw91 pseudopotentials with the small basis ( fe @xmath39 and pd @xmath41 as core electrons ) is sufficient , which is especially helpful for expensive calculations of large systems .",
    "two standard techniques are currently applied for the investigation of lattice dynamics of crystals from first principles : the linear response method and the so - called direct method.@xcite    in the linear response method the dynamical matrix is obtained from the modification of the electron density , via the inverse of dielectric matrix describing the response of the valence electron density to a periodic lattice perturbation . the dielectric matrix is then calculated from the eigenfunctions and energy levels of the unperturbed system.@xcite only linear effects , such as harmonic phonons , are accessible to this technique .",
    "the method has been applied with success to many alloys related to our present study.@xcite    on the other hand , the direct - method is a frozen - phonon type of calculations based on a supercell calculation , which allows explicit account of any distortion of the atomic positions .",
    "the phonon frequencies are calculated from hellmann - feynman forces generated by the small atomic displacements , one at a time . hence using the information of the crystal symmetry space group , the force constants are derived ,",
    "the dynamical matrix is built and diagonalized , and its eigenvalues arranged into phonon dispersion relations . in this way ,",
    "phonon frequencies at selected high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone can be calculated.@xcite the direct approach in conjunction with the _ ab_-initio method has previously been used intensively by the authors to investigate phonon dispersion relations in magnetic shape memory heusler compounds.@xcite    the results presented within this work are relying on the direct approach together with the vasp code for the calculation of the respective forces ; the displacements being necessary to describe the phonon dispersions were generated by the phon code written by dario alf.@xcite this code was also used later on to generate the dynamical matrix and the resulting phonon dispersion relations .",
    "we used a supercell of 5@xmath485@xmath485 primitive cells , containing 500 atoms in total .",
    "for sufficient accuracy of the forces a @xmath26-mesh of 4@xmath484@xmath484 points in the full brillouin zone was employed in connection with the methfessel - paxton finite temperature integration scheme ( smearing parameter @xmath49@xmath20.1ev ) .",
    "first - principles calculations of this size are computationally very demanding and can , so far , only be performed on world leading supercomputer installations . the forces were calculated for three independent displacements of @xmath50 in size each . from these calculations",
    "the phonon dispersions along the lines connecting the main symmetry points and the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) were calculated . for the latter , a mesh of 61@xmath4861@xmath4861 points in reciprocal @xmath51-space was used and additional gaussian broadening with a smearing parameter of @xmath49@xmath20.1thz was applied .",
    "we also carried out comparative calculations for d0@xmath5 fe@xmath5ni and l1@xmath3 fe@xmath5pt using the linear response method as implemented in the pwscf package.@xcite to describe the interaction between ionic cores and valence electrons , we used for fe@xmath5ni ultra - soft pseudo - potentials@xcite generated using the exchange correlation functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) .",
    "the pseudopotentials for fe@xmath5pt were generated for the exchange correlation of perdew - zunger within local density approximation ( lda).@xcite the technical parameters used here , were a kinetic energy cutoff of 50 ry , an energy cutoff for the augmentation charges of 600 ry and 12@xmath4812@xmath4812 @xmath26-points in the full brillouin zone ( monkhorst - pack ) .",
    "for the phonon dispersions , a mesh of 4@xmath484@xmath484 @xmath51-points in the reciprocal space was used for the fcc basis , yielding 8 sets with finite weight while for the simple cubic basis a 2@xmath482@xmath482 @xmath51-points mesh was used yielding 4 sets of special @xmath51-vectors with finite weight . although the technical parameters are less tight , the obtained dispersions agree well on a qualitative level with the ones obtained within the direct approach ( except for discrepancies which can be partially related to the use of lda in the latter case as the typical underestimation of the lattice constant as well as an extension of the instability of the ta@xmath17 branch to the @xmath52-point , see also ref .  ) and are therefore not explicitly presented in this manuscript .",

    "a systematic _ ab - initio _ comparison of all three alloys with respect to structural properties along the bain path , describing the transformation from fcc - type to bcc - type structure , however , is still missing and therefore concisely presented in the subsequent section .",

    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "as is easily seen from the contour plots , the optimum @xmath22 ratio varies from close to bcc ( @xmath53 ) for fe@xmath5ni over bct ( @xmath55 ) for fe@xmath5pd to fcc ( @xmath36 ) for fe@xmath5pt .",
    "this trend can not simply be interpreted in terms of the atomic volume as , especially for fe@xmath5pd and fe@xmath5pt , the equilibrium volumes nearly coincide .",
    "this is in good agreement with experimental measurements ( see the collection of okamoto , ref .  , for an extensive overview ) .",
    "especially the relation between lattice parameter and composition of fe@xmath5pd exhibits a strong positive deviation from vegards law .",
    "the overall variation of the energy landscape along the bain path is exceptionally small for all three alloys .",
    "it is with 22mev / atom largest for fe@xmath5ni and smallest for fe@xmath5pd with only 4mev / atom ( minimum to saddle point ) .",
    "the shift of the minima agrees well with the fact that in the phase diagram of ordered fe@xmath5pt the stability range of the body centered structures at @xmath59@xmath2@xmath60k ends at higher fe - content compared to the other alloys as well as with the trend in the martensitic transition temperatures , which are reduced on variation of the second element from ni to pt .",
    "the maximum change in equilibrium volume associated with a full tetragonal transformation along the bain path is small , less than one percent for all three alloys .",
    "there is also a strong experimental indication for an unusually flat energy surface .",
    "recently , it has been shown that thin disordered fe@xmath9pd@xmath10 films can be grown epitaxially on different substrates inducing different lattice constants @xmath20 in the film plane.@xcite the corresponding perpendicular lattice constant , @xmath16 , however , is free to adjust , thereby realizing @xmath22 ratios covering most of the bain path .",
    "such a strained epitaxial growth can only be expected if the energy associated with the lattice strain is sufficiently small along the bain path .",
    "+    the magnetic moment is largest on the bcc side , however , there is only little variation of the spin moments along the bain path , which is of the order of 0.1@xmath61/atom ( cf . , fig .",

    "the formation of a d0@xmath5 phase in ordered near - stoichiometric fe@xmath5pt might further be hindered by the slow kinetics of the necessary diffusive transformation at comparatively low temperatures .",

    "the inability of the experiment to provide a complete comparison of the ordered phases ( which are easier to understand ) together with the incomplete record of theoretical studies motivates our attempt to provide a comparative overview of the phonon dispersion of all three ordered isoelectronic alloys from first principles .",

    "this is common for all three alloys , but most pronounced in fe@xmath5pt .",
    "the occurrence of imaginary frequencies reflects the the instability of the lattice which may gain energy by static atomic displacements according to the corresponding phonon mode .",
    "a strong anomalous softening of the ta@xmath17 branch is a widely discussed observation from neutron diffraction experiments on ordered fe@xmath5pt.@xcite with decreasing temperature starting from the paramagnetic phase , the ta@xmath17 mode becomes increasingly softer at the m - point , finally reaching phonon energies as low as 3mev for @xmath63k .",
    "the microscopic nature of the corresponding displacements will be discussed in the following section .",
    "an incomplete softening of the ta@xmath17 branch with anomalous temperature dependence is also found for the disordered alloys .",

    "the cubic l1@xmath3 state describes only a saddle point .",

    "the corresponding eigenvectors are close to @xmath65 and @xmath66 and practically uniform for all four atoms in the primitive cells .",

    "in addition , the softening in [ 111 ] direction is more pronounced in our study .",
    "previous semi - empirical calculations based on a tight - binding scheme on the other hand did only show comparable softening if the strength of the electron phonon coupling was artificially enhanced.@xcite this underlines the necessity to fully take into account the coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom within a first - principles approach .",
    "still , the convergence with respect to the subdivision in reciprocal space for the electronic structure as well as for the lattice dynamics remains an important issue .",
    "another quantity which allows for a detailed comparison with experiment is the element resolved vibrational density of states ( vdos ) which is shown in the diagrams on the left of the dispersions . for alloys with a large mass difference",
    ", we expect a clear separation between the elemental contributions .",
    "this is indeed the case for fe@xmath5pt , where we find a pseudo - gap at phonon energies around 17mev . above this energy",
    ", there is only little contribution from pt vibrations , while we find a hybridization of pt and fe contributions in the energy range below . in fe@xmath5pd ,",
    "the pd states move to higher energies , filling up the pseudo - gap and there is increased hybridization of the partial contributions at the optical bands in the uppermost part .",
    "this trend consequently continues for fe@xmath5ni , moving the central peak of the partial vdos of ni up to an energy of 22.5mev . in turn , the distinct low energy peak appearing around 10mev for fe@xmath5pt and fe@xmath5pd has disappeared . in all three cases",
    ", there exists a significant contribution of fe - states in the low energy region ( @xmath68mev ) .",

    "_ et al._@xcite using the mbauer approach .",
    "the pseudo - gap , however , is not showing up in experimental vdos as these generally experience a stronger broadening , which may be attributed to finite temperature of the measurements , resolution of the measurement devices and  not at last  the incomplete ordering usually present in fe@xmath5pt samples .    the disappearance of the sharp energy peak in the vdos around 10mev points out a qualitative difference between fe@xmath5ni and the other two alloys . in the latter case ,",
    "these states are connected with vibrational modes at the m and the r - point which are dominated by motions of the pt or , respectively , pd atoms as can be seen from the atomic polarization of the phonon dispersions shown in the intensity ( color ) coding in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp - l12 ] . in fe@xmath5ni",
    ", however , the low lying modes in the vicinity of the m - point mainly involve fe - atoms , which makes the fe - subsystem particularly soft and susceptible to element specific distortions , e.g. , due to magnetoelastic coupling .",

    "both vibrations match with a translation along one half of the the face diagonal ( [ 110 ] direction ) as shown by the thick ( blue ) arrow , whereby the two vibrations remain the same but shifted in phase by @xmath69.,width=302 ]    as laid out in the previous paragraph , the two lowest frequencies in the dispersion of l1@xmath3 fe@xmath5ni at the m - point involve only motions of the fe species . since the associated wave - vector corresponds to the brillouin zone boundary , the amplitudes are opposite at either end of the primitive cell .",
    "therefore the term _ antiferrodistortive transformation _ has been has been coined for the condensation of the unstable phonon mode.@xcite the displacements can be inferred from the corresponding eigenvectors and are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ] .",
    "they belong to motions of the fe - atoms either in direction of one of the two nearest neighbor ni pairs , or perpendicular to this direction .",
    "if one describes the primitive cell as an fe - octahedron encaged by ni - atoms at the corner positions of the cube , the mode can be described in the first case as a rotational motion of the perimeter atoms in the ( 001 ) fe - plane , while the top and bottom atoms in the mixed plane remain in place .",
    "this kind of rotational mode is well known from perovskite structures , where oxygen octahedra form such tilted structures.@xcite in the second case , it is rather described as a kind of breathing motion of the perimeter atoms in the fe - plane , where one half of the atoms move inwards and the other half move outwards leading to an orthorhombic distortion of the fe - octahedron . keeping the terminology of noda and endoh as well as kstner and coworkers , we will call these modes m4 and m2 , respectively .",
    "displacements according to both phonon modes lower the symmetry of the crystal and reduce the space group of the cubic l@xmath70 phase , pm@xmath71 m ( number 221 ) , to p4/mbm ( number 127 ) . since the latter is already tetragonal",
    ", a variation of @xmath22 does not imply another change of symmetry , which corresponds well to the experimental reports of a low temperature fct phase .    ) .",
    "results are shown for fe@xmath5ni , fe@xmath5pd and fe@xmath5pt .",
    "the lines are polynomials fitted to the calculated data points . for all three alloys , displacements according to the m2-mode lead to a decrease in energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "+    as mentioned above , the nature of the distortions leading to the softening of the phonon modes can be inferred in principle from the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix which can be constructed , e.g. , by a born - von - karmann fit to the experimental dispersions .",
    "this indirect procedure often leaves room for ambiguities and has lead to a controversy about the nature of the unstable mode in the past.@xcite a more direct approach is to monitor the variation of the total energy as a function of the displacement according to the ( frozen ) phonon modes .",
    "this can be realized in a straight forward manner within a density functional theory approach .",
    "we construct 2@xmath482@xmath481 supercells by doubling the primitive l1@xmath3 cell in the plane of the atomic motion and apply the corresponding displacements @xmath72 as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ] .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2m4 ] , unambigously proves that for all three alloys the m2 mode leads to a lower energy even for very small @xmath72 , explaining the imaginary frequencies at the m - point . in fe@xmath5pt and fe@xmath5pd ,",
    "the energy gain can reach values of about 5mev / atom for displacements of about 0.08 to 0.09 . in fe@xmath5ni",
    "this energy gain is significantly smaller and the minimum energy is obtained for smaller displacements . on the other hand ,",
    "the m4 mode is considerably softer in fe@xmath5ni than in the other two alloys . here",
    ", the two lowest frequencies correspond to the two pure fe modes , while for the other two alloys the second eigenvalue has a marked contribution of the heavier element . in the latter case , the m4 mode",
    "is represented by the 5th and the 6th eigenvalue with frequencies of 18.7mev and 19.4mev for fe@xmath5pd and fe@xmath5pt , respectively , as opposed to 9.3mev for fe@xmath5ni . in this respect",
    ", it may be important to notice that a translation of the mixed ( 001 ) plane in [ 1@xmath730 ] direction , which leads to an exchange of the fe and ni - group atoms , transforms both modes , m2 and m4 , in each other . applying this transformation once every second unit cell transforms the l@xmath70 in d0@xmath4 order , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] .",
    "d0@xmath4 can thus also be regarded as an l@xmath70 structure with maximum density of anti - phase boundaries .",
    "thus atoms in the fe - plane will feel a superposition between both environtments and displacements according to m2 and m4 modes become equivalent .",
    "therefore , we expect that such distortions of the order will likely harden the soft phonon at the m - point , especially for fe@xmath5pd and fe@xmath5pt .          while the total energy calculations supply us with the information that the imaginary phonon mode is related to an orthorhombic distortion of the fe octahedra in the l1@xmath3 unit cell , we are still left with the task to find the origin of this instability",
    ". a clue can be obtained from the comparison of the respective electronic density of states , which is shown paradigmatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] for the undistorted , perfect l1@xmath3 structure of fe@xmath5pt as well as for supercells with m2 and m4 distortions .",
    "for all three cases , the majority spin density of states remains similar .",
    "the l1@xmath3 dos is in excellent agreement with the previous extensive study of podgrny,@xcite apart from a small shift of the fermi level in both spin channels which can be attributed to the use of an exchange correlation functional without gradient corrections in ref .  .",
    "fe@xmath5pt is at the onset of strong ferromagnetism , thus the @xmath74-states of the majority spin channel are filled and the respective dos is small at the fermi energy , @xmath75 , leaving no room for changes that could account for the structural distortions .",
    "this , however , does not apply for the minority spin channel , where a considerable number of @xmath74-states is encountered right at @xmath75 , especially for the undistorted l1@xmath3 structure .",
    "the vast majority of these states comes from the fe atoms , while the pt dos remains small , due to the nearly filled @xmath74-shell and only moderate induced magnetic polarization of 0.36@xmath76 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the condensation of the m2-mode opens a deep pseudo - gap right at the fermi - level which is the indication of an extensive redistribution of states . in the spirit of a band - jahn - teller mechanism , lifting",
    "the degeneracy of electronic states at the fermi level can lead to a net gain in band energy .",
    "this has been previously proposed as the main electronic mechanism leading to the tetragonal distortion in disordered magnetic shape memory fe - pd alloys.@xcite    accordingly , a distortion corresponding to the m4 mode does not decrease the number of states at @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless , it opens another pseudo - gap 0.25ev below the fermi level .",
    "although this gap is very narrow and should be expected to vanish already at rather low temperatures , it appears possible that a moderate decrease of the valence electron concentration @xmath6 may bring this pseudo - gap to the fermi level and possibly causes a change the order of the modes at the m - point which alters the corresponding ground state structure .",
    "the appearance of a pseudo - gap at @xmath75 implies a severe reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "such reconstructions in connection with anomalous softening of the acoustic modes are a sign of strong electron - phonon coupling and frequently related to a kohn anomaly .",
    "this involves a significant number of nesting states at @xmath75 that can be connected with the same reciprocal vector which describes the anomaly in the phonon dispersions .",
    "fermi - surface nesting and strong electron - phonon coupling in combination with transitions to modulated phases are commonly found in conventional and magnetic shape memory systems , as ni - al , ni - ti and ni - mn - ga.@xcite in fact , the phonon softening in disordered fe - ni invar has been related previously to a kohn anomaly in the nonmagnetic state on the basis of first principles calculations of ordered fe@xmath5ni.@xcite here , we consider spin - polarized minority spin fermi surfaces , i.e. , the isosurfaces formed by the kohn - sham eigenvalues at the fermi level in reciprocal space . these are depicted for fe@xmath5ni and fe@xmath5pt in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs - both ] and we find good agreement of the shape with previous results obtained using wien2k.@xcite    six bands are crossing @xmath75 in the minority spin channel making the fermi surfaces quite complex objects .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to relate nesting behavior to two of these bands , the 13th and the 15th band which are shown separately in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs - partial ] .",
    "the 13th minority spin band represents an extended spherical hole pocket around the @xmath52-point with hopper - shaped extrusions reaching the brilloin zone boundary .",
    "facilitated by the cubic symmetry , the flattened , horizontal walls of these extrusions can provide nesting with a vector of exactly @xmath77 , c.f .",
    "[ fig : fs - partial ] ( a ) .",
    "these parts are connected by a tangential nesting vector , which is insensitive to a specific value of @xmath51 and not expected to produce a sharp contribution to the generalized susceptibility .",
    "there is another possibility for nesting between the fermi surfaces of 13th and the 15th band .",
    "the 15th band forms a cubic electron pocket around the r - point as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs - partial ] ( b ) .",
    "the walls of the cubes are nearly located on the same plane as the flattened parts of the 13th band .",
    "this plane is parallel to the boundary of the cubic brillouin zone .",
    "two of them exist in each of the cubic directions , such that nesting can occur between the two bands on the two different planes , respectively .",
    "the correspondence in this case is not necessarily exactly @xmath77 and in direction of the face diagonal , but it can be expected to provide a pronounced peak in the generalized susceptibility and thus a considerable contribution to electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs - partial ] ( c ) , taken at two different values of @xmath78 , demonstrate that this correspondence is not restricted to the zone boundary , but rather affects a significant portion of the fermi suface .",
    "for fe@xmath5ni the hopper - shaped extrusions of the 13th band are smaller and the cubes larger than in the fermi - surface of fe@xmath5pt , which results in a smaller distance between the parallel planes and thus a smaller length of the @xmath51 vector .",
    "this coincides nicely with the shift of the instability in the ta@xmath17-branch away from the m - point as well as the smaller magnitude of the imaginary eigenvalue .",
    "it should be mentioned that a thorough investigation of the relation between fermi surface nesting and transformative processes requires a detailed statistics , e.g. , an evaluation of the generalized susceptibility with respect to all contributing reciprocal vectors as well as the calculation of the electron - phonon coupling matrix elements .",
    "this is a formidable task in itself and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , in our view , the purely graphical discussion above gives already sufficient arguments that a kohn anomaly is responsible for the low temperature structural changes in the ordered alloys .",
    "within the present investigation , we systematically compared structural , electronic and dynamic properties of ordered fe - rich alloys with the elements of the ni - group .",
    "the only one of these three alloy , which can be obtained experimentally in the ordered state , fe@xmath5pt , is also the only one which possesses an fcc ground - state structure .",
    "the dominant type of ordering in all three alloys is l1@xmath3 , in accordance with experimental observation .",
    "competing d0@xmath4 order was observed for hypothetical fe@xmath5ni and fe@xmath5pd for fct structures with a tetragonal distortion @xmath79 and for fe@xmath5pt with bcc coordination .",
    "however , for ideal fcc ( @xmath36 ) , d0@xmath4 order is well within the range of thermal energies , suggesting that anti - phase boundaries are very likely to appear in the cubic l1@xmath3 phases .",
    "the phonon dispersions of the three alloys possess as a common feature a complete softening of ta@xmath17 branch in [ 110 ] direction around the m - point , which is strongest for fe@xmath5pt and fe@xmath5pd as well as a partial softening along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "the first leads to the freezing of the respective phonon mode ( m2 ) which can be identified as an orthorhombic distortion of the fe octahedra in the primitive l1@xmath3 cell without involving the ni - group elements .",
    "the second anomaly becomes increasingly pronounced with decreasing mass of the ni - group element , as this leads effectively to an increased fe - contribution to the low energy acoustical phonons .",
    "it may be speculated whether the rather smeared out softening of the ta@xmath17 branch in [ 110 ] direction in the disordered alloys can be interpreted in terms of a corresponding distortion with similar electronic origin , but on a larger , statistically modified period .",
    "this owes to the fact that the fe - octahedra can be considered to be statistically distributed within the bulk alloy and result finally in a rather broadened and less pronounced anomaly .",
    "these octahedra are characteristic for the l1@xmath3 structure , but also other locally fe - enriched cluster configurations , which are more or less susceptible to deformations , may contribute .",
    "similarly , the gross electronic structure will appear rather smeared out for the disordered crystal , but distinct features may prevail locally within suitable fe - clusters and induce corresponding local distortions . indeed , characteristic relaxations of the atomic positions have been reported in _ ab initio _ calculations for fcc feni - invar alloys for 64-atom quasi - random structures.@xcite this also fits well with our observation that in fe@xmath5ni not only the m2 mode but also the orthogonal m4 mode becomes rather soft at the m - point , which makes collective motions in the fe-(001 ) planes very cost effective .",
    "furthermore , own investigations considering structural relaxations of 108-atom fe - pd and fe - pt supercells with random distribution of atoms , yield a considerable energy gain from a similar relaxation process.@xcite    the sum of these observations supports the view that the origin of the anomalous features in the acoustical branches can be attributed solely to the fe species .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculation of the electronic structure of the l1@xmath3 ordered and the distorted alloys .",
    "the condensation of the m2 mode opens a pseudo - gap in the minority density of states right at the fermi level , reducing the density of states by nearly 50% .",
    "again , only contributions from fe states are involved .",
    "the origin for this strong reconstruction of the fermi surface can be related to extended flat areas which nest with a reciprocal vector of nearly @xmath77 which corresponds to the softening of the ta@xmath17 phonon mode at the m - point .",
    "the subtle interdependence between electronic structure at the fermi level and the antiferro - distortive transformation confirms once more that the valence electron density , which controls the overall filling of the minority spin channel on a fine level , is one of the key factors for the design of fe - rich functional alloys . on the basis of our investigation",
    ", we further conclude  in accordance with ref .",
    " that the specific concentration of the fe - species must be considered as another important quantity and , additionally , the mass of the alloying elements which modifies the lattice dynamics related to the low lying acoustical modes .",
