    "in this paper we deal with the problem of ergodic optimization and , more precisely with the study of grounds states .",
    "ergodic optimization is a relatively new branch of ergodic theory and is very active since the 2000 s . for a given dynamical system @xmath3",
    ", the goal is to study existence and properties of the invariant probabilities which maximize a given potential @xmath4 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a survey about ergodic optimization .    ground states are particular maximizing measures which can be reached by freezing the system as limit of equilibrium states .",
    "namely , for @xmath5 , which in statistical mechanics represents the inverse of the temperature , we consider the / an equilibrium state associated to @xmath6 , that is a @xmath7-invariant probability whose free energy @xmath8 is maximal ( where @xmath9 is the kolmogorov entropy of the measure @xmath10 ) . then , considering an equilibrium state @xmath11 , it is easy to check ( see @xcite ) that any accumulation point for @xmath11 as @xmath12 goes is the inverse of the temperature , thus @xmath13 means @xmath14 , which means we freeze the system . ] to @xmath15 is a maximizing measure for @xmath16 .",
    "the first main question is to know if @xmath11 converges .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that for an uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems , generically in the @xmath17-topology , @xmath16 has a unique maximizing measure .",
    "therefore , convergence of @xmath11 obviously holds in that case .",
    "nevertheless , generic results do not concern all the possibilities , and it is very easy to build examples , which at least for the mathematical point of view are meaningful , and for which the set of ergodic maximizing measures is as wild as wanted .    for these situations , the question of convergence is of course fully relevant .",
    "cases of convergence or non - convergence are known ( see @xcite ) , but the general theory is far away of being solved . in particular , no criterion which guaranties convergence ( except the uniqueness of the maximizing measure or the locally constant case ) is known , say for the lipschitz continuous case .    the second main question , and that is the one we want to focus on here , is the problem of the selection . assuming that @xmath16 has several ergodic maximizing measures and that @xmath11 converges , what is the limit . in other words , is there a way to predict the limit from the potential , or equivalently , what makes the equilibrium state select one locus instead of another one ?",
    "inspired by a similar study for the lagrangian mechanics ( @xcite ) , it was conjectured by a.o .",
    "lopes that flatness of the potential would be a criterion for selection and that the equilibrium state always selects the locus where the potential is the flattest . in @xcite",
    "it is actually proved that the conjecture is not entirely correct .",
    "authors consider in the full 3-shift a negative potential except on the two fixed points @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where it vanishes but is sharper in @xmath19 than in @xmath18 .",
    "then , they prove that the equilibrium state actually converges , but not necessarily to the dirac measure at @xmath18 .",
    "the first part of the conjecture is however not ( yet ) invalided and the question to know if flatness is a criterion for selection is still relevant .    here , we make a step in the direction of proving that flatness is indeed a criterion for selection .",
    "precise statements are given in the next subsection .",
    "we consider in the full shift with @xmath0 symbols a potential , negative everywhere except on @xmath1 bernoulli subshifts with @xmath2 symbols .",
    "figure [ fig - shift1 ] illustrates the dynamics .",
    "then , flatness is ordered on these @xmath1 bernoulli subshifts : the potential is flatter on the first one than on the second one , then , it is flatter on the second one than on the third one , and then so on ( see below for complete settings ) .",
    "any of these bernoulli shifts has a unique measure of maximal entropy , and the set of ground states is contained in the convex hull of these @xmath1-measures .",
    "we show here that the equilibrium state converges and selects a convex combination of the two ergodic measures with supports in the two flattest bernoulli subshifts .",
    "we emphasize that this result is absolutely not in contradiction with @xcite . indeed , in @xcite it is proved that the equilibrium state converges to a convex combination of the dirac measures at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are obviously the two flattest loci !",
    "we consider the full - shift @xmath20 with @xmath0 symbols , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 two positive integers .",
    "we also consider @xmath0 positive real numbers , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "it appeared very recently in @xcite .",
    "we point out that convergence of the eigenfunction to a subaction is related to the study of a large deviation principle for the convergence of @xmath11 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "_    we emphasize that this conjecture does not mean that there is convergence `` into '' the components",

    "this conjecture is for the moment far of being proved , in particular because several notions are not yet completely clear . in particular the notion of flatness has to be specified .",
    "moreover , the components are not necessarily subshifts of finite type , which is an obstacle to study their ( for instance ) measures of maximal entropy .",
    "the work presented here , is for a specific form of potential for which flatness is easily defined .",
    "the dynamics into the irreducible components and also the global dynamics are easy .",
    "we believe that the main issue here is to identify flatness as a criterion for selection .",
    "the next step would be to release assumptions on the dynamics ; in particular we would like that theses components are not full shift and that the global dynamics is not a full shift .",
    "it is also highly probable that the conjecture should be adapted after we have solve this case .",
    "distortion into the dynamics could perhaps favor other components .",
    "the last step would be to get the result for general ( or as general as possible ) potential .    nevertheless , and even if the present work is presented as a work in progress and an intermediate step before a more general statement , we want to moderate the specificity of the potential we consider here . for a uniformly hyperbolic system @xmath3 and for any hlder function @xmath16",
