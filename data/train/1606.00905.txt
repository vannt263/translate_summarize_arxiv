    "three - dimensional topological insulators ( 3d ti ) represent a recently discovered new state of matter @xcite .",
    "their hallmark is the formation of conducting surface states with the dirac dispersion relation ( similar to graphene ) , whereas the bulk states are gapped . recently",
    "a lot of interest has been attracted to the physics of hybrid structures involving topological insulators and other materials , for example new electronic states have been predicted to appear in ti contacts to ferromagnets and superconductors , such as a magnetic monopole @xcite and a majorana fermion ( mf ) @xcite .",
    "a mf has been a primary focus of many extensive studies , since it was proposed as a building block of a topological qubit , that is robust against local decoherence @xcite .",
    "when the topological insulator is placed in the electrical contact with the superconductor ( s ) , the superconducting pair correlations penetrate into the topological state due to the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "its key mechanism is the andreev reflection process , which provides the possibility for converting single electron states from a topological insulator to cooper pairs in the superconducting condensate @xcite .",
    "recently the s / ti proximity effect was studied by many authors and the formation of an exotic pair potential with the so called odd - frequency spin - triplet pairing component in the ti surface was predicted in some particular cases , for example in the presence of the external magnetic field @xcite .    in accordance with the pauli principle",
    ", the total wave function of a pair of fermions should be asymmetric and can be described by the product of an orbital ( or parity ) , spin and energy ( or matsubara frequency ) term @xcite .",
    "even - frequency pairing means that a function is even in energy .",
    "if we consider singlet ( which is an odd function under spin permutation ) s- or d - wave ( orbitally symmetric ) pairing , the pairing wave function should be even in momentum in order for the wave function to be antisymmetric when the pairing is even in energy .",
    "this is the so called even - frequency spin - singlet even - parity ( ese ) pairing symmetry class . for p - wave triplet pairing the pairing wave function should be odd in the momentum .",
    "this symmetry class is referred to as even - frequency spin - triplet odd - parity ( eto ) pairing .",
    "however , the so - called odd - frequency pairing states when the pair amplitude is an odd function of energy can also exist .",
    "it was first proposed by berezinskii in the context of @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "then , the odd - frequency spin - singlet odd - parity ( oso ) and the odd - frequency spin - triplet even - parity ( ote ) pairing states are allowed by the pauli principle .",
    "the oso pairing is quite generally induced near the normal metal/ superconductor interface during the formation of the andreev bound states @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown , that in s / ti heterostructures another type of an odd - frequency pairing is induced in the presence of the external magnetic field , perpendicular to the topological insulator surface - the ote pairing state @xcite .",
    "it was shown by asano and tanaka that in a one - dimensional nano - wire , proximity coupled to a topological superconductor , the ote pairing and the majorana fermion are `` two sides of a same coin '' @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that similar assumption is valid for two - dimensional topological surface states of a three - dimensional topological insulator in proximity with an s - wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "we note here that the symmetry of the induced pair potential in s / ti structures in the diffusive case was studied in @xcite .",
    "a majorana fermion is a topological state that is its own anti - particle , in striking contrast to any known fermion so far @xcite .",
    "generally , in solid state physics , electronic transport can either be described in terms of electrons or in terms of holes .",
    "the electron and hole excitations in the superconductor play the role of particle and antiparticle .",
    "electrons ( filled states above the chemical potential ) and holes ( empty states below the chemical potential ) have opposite spin and charge , but the charge difference of @xmath1 can be absorbed as a cooper pair in the s - wave superconducting condensate . in order for a majorana fermion to exist , it would have to be simultaneously half - electron and half - hole and electrically neutral .",
    "therefore , the zero energy is a likely place to look for a majorana fermion .",
    "experimentalists have already reported signatures of the majorana zero - energy mode , where zero - bias conductance peaks are the main features observed in this context @xcite .",
    "signatures of majorana zero modes were also observed in the josephson effect in hgte - based junctions @xcite , in ferromagnetic atomic chains formed on a superconductor @xcite , and in a semiconductor coulomb island in proximity with a superconductor @xcite .",
    "impressive number of theoretical studies of electron transport in different hybrid devices containing majorana fermions was published in recent years @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions in superconductor/ topological insulator ( s / ti ) hybrid structures have been first predicted by fu and kane @xcite as zero energy states at the site of a vortex , induced by the magnetic field on the surface of the topological insulator in proximity with a superconductor .",
    "a mf was also predicted to occur if the externally applied magnetic field is replaced by the magnetic moment of a nearby ferromagnetic insulator ( fi ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the majorana fermion turns out to be a one - dimensional linearly dispersing mode along the s / fi boundary , when a s / fi junction is formed on the topological insulator surface @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the interplay between topological order and superconducting correlations performing a symmetry analysis of the induced pair potential based on the anomalous green function and analyze the conditions of possible realization of the majorana mode in a hybrid structure , where a s / fi junction is formed on the topological surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ boundary](a ) @xcite .",
    "we take into account the hexagonal warping effect , which was never considered previously in this connection , for example in ref .  @xcite . since the majorana fermion and the odd - frequency spin - triplet even - parity ( ote ) pairing are related to each other it is important to study the effect of the hexagonal warping on the ote pairing component realization of the proximity effect . in the end of the paper",
    "we make some predictions about the mf realization in the structure under consideration , based on the symmetry arguments .",
    "the aforementioned studies of the proximity effect and the majorana bound states on the surface of a 3d topological insulator were performed within the simplest model , when the energy dispersion was described with an isotropic dirac cone . within the @xmath2 theory a 2@xmath32 hamiltonian of surface states in this model to",
    "the lowest order in @xmath4 reads @xmath5 [ so called dirac - type hamiltonian ] . here",
    "@xmath6 is a chemical potential , @xmath7 is a fermi velocity , @xmath8 denotes in - plane quasiparticle momentum , and @xmath9 are the pauli matrices ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is also possible to use a bychkov - rashba term @xcite in the hamiltonian of a topological insulator , @xmath11 this gives rise to a different spin - momentum locking on the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all conclusions on the excitation spectrum are independent of whether one uses the dirac or bychkov - rashba type of the hamiltonian @xcite . however , such isotropic forms of the hamiltonian are only valid if the chemical potential lies near the dirac point , while in realistic topological insulators it usually lies well above this point , where the dirac cone distortion ca nt be any more neglected .    to develop more realistic theoretical description of the superconducting proximity effect in the topological insulator surface states it is important to take into account the dirac cone anisotropy . for example , the fermi surface of bi@xmath12te@xmath13 topological insulator observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is nearly a hexagon , having snowflake - like shape : it has relatively sharp tips extending along six directions and curves inward in between @xcite . moreover",
    ", the shape of constant energy contour is energy - dependent , evolving from a snowflake to a hexagon and then to a circle near the dirac point , see fig .",
    "later same anisotropy was found in bi@xmath12se@xmath13 @xcite , pb(bi , sb)@xmath12te@xmath14@xcite and other topological insulator materials @xcite .",
    "= 8.0 cm    recently it was realized that the aforementioned simplified hamiltonian can be extended to higher order terms in the momentum .",
    "namely , fu found an unconventional hexagonal warping term @xmath15 in the surface band structure , which is the counterpart of cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling in rhombohedral structures @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of surface states then reads , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by eq .",
    "( [ h_0 ] ) , the hexagonal warping term reads @xmath18 @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the hexagonal warping strength .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ fu ] ) describes perfectly the warped dirac cone as schematically shown in fig .  [ cone ] .",
    "it is the consequence of the rhombohedral crystal structure symmetry , typical to three - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "representative values for the material parameters @xmath7 and @xmath20 can be inferred from arpes ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we stress here that the term in eq .",
    "( [ warping ] ) is different from the trigonal warping term in graphene @xcite .    the warping term , eq .",
    "( [ warping ] ) , breaks the rotational symmetry of the dirac cone .",
    "moreover , it is an odd - parity term , since it is odd under transformation @xmath21 .",
    "it is then obvious that addition of this term may dramatically change the physical properties of topological insulator surface states .",
    "the consequences of warping on magnetic @xcite and transport properties @xcite of topological insulators have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "recently the magnetic order on a topological insulator surface with hexagonal warping and proximity - induced superconductivity was also studied in @xcite .",
    "we consider an s - wave superconductor/ ferromagnetic insulator ( s / fi ) junction formed on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator in the @xmath22-@xmath23 plane , see fig .",

    "the s / fi boundary is perpendicular to the @xmath22-direction , so that the fi layer lies in @xmath24 half - plane , while the s layer in @xmath25 half - plane .",
    "since the superconducting correlations extend in the lateral direction on the scale of superconducting coherence length , we can consider both the superconducting pair potential and the magnetic moment in the effective @xmath26-dependent hamiltonian @xcite , describing the ti surface states in vicinity of the s / fi boundary ( we use `` check '' for @xmath27 and `` hat '' for @xmath28 matrices ) , @xmath29 here @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the superconducting pair potential , induced in the topological insulator surface due to the proximity effect , and @xmath32 is the spin - splitting ( exchange ) field of the ferromagnetic insulator , which we consider to be perpendicular to the topological surface , i.e. along the @xmath33-axis .    in order to determine the pairing relations for the topological surface states near the s / f boundary we start with the following equation , @xmath34 \\check{g } = \\check{1},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the green s function of the topological states in vicinity of the s / fi boundary",
