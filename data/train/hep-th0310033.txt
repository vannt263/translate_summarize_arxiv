    "these lectures are primarily about light - cone string field theory , which is an ancient subject ( by modern standards ) whose origins lie in the days of ` dual resonance models ' even before string theory was studied as a theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "light - cone string field theory is nothing more than the study of string theory ( especially string interactions ) via hamiltonian quantization in light - cone gauge .",
    "let us immediately illustrate this point .",
    "textbooks on string theory typically begin by considering the polyakov action for a free string , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-dimensional string worldsheet ( we consider only closed strings in these lectures ) , @xmath3 is the metric on @xmath1 , and @xmath4 is the embedding of the string worldsheet into spacetime .",
    "quantizing this theory is simplest in light - cone gauge , where the ghosts are not needed , and one finds the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 labels the directions transverse to the light - cone . at this stage",
    "most textbooks abandon light - cone gauge in favor of more powerful and mathematically beautiful covariant techniques .    however , it is also possible to continue by second - quantizing ( or third - quantizing , depending on how you count ) the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hflat ] ) . to do this",
    "we introduce a multi - string hilbert space , with operators acting to create or annihilate entire strings ( not to be confused with the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which create or annihilate an oscillation of frequency @xmath9 on a given string ) .",
    "all of the details will be presented in lecture  2 , where our ultimate goal will be to write down a relatively simple interaction term which ( at least for the bosonic string ) is able to reproduce ( in principle ) all possible string scattering amplitudes !",
    "light - cone string field theory obscures many important properties of string theory which are manifest in a covariant treatment .",
    "nevertheless , the subject has recently enjoyed a remarkable renaissance following @xcite because it is well - suited for studying string interactions in a maximally symmetric plane wave background , where covariant techniques are more complicated than they are in flat space .",
    "one of the most exciting developments in string theory has been the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the best understood example of this correspondence relates type iib string theory on @xmath10 to su(@xmath11 ) yang - mills theory with @xmath12 supersymmetry .",
    "although we have learned a tremendous amount about gauge theory , quantum gravity , and the holographic principle from ads / cft , the full promise of the duality has unfortunately not yet been realized .",
    "the reason is simple : string theory on @xmath10 is hard !",
    "in contrast to  ( [ eq : flatspace ] ) , the green - schwarz superstring on @xmath10 is nontrivial .",
    "it can be regarded as a coset sigma model on @xmath13 with an additional fermionic wess - zumino term and a fermionic @xmath14-symmetry @xcite . despite some intriguing recent progress @xcite ,",
    "this theory remains intractable and we still do not know the free string spectrum ( i.e. , the analogue of  ( [ eq : hflat ] ) ) in @xmath10 .",
    "because of this difficulty , most applications of the ads / cft correspondence rely on the supergravity approximation to the full string theory .",
    "recently , a third maximally symmetric 10-dimensional solution of type iib string theory was found @xcite : the so - called maximally symmetric plane wave background .",
    "this background can be obtained from @xmath10 by taking a penrose limit , and it is essentially flat space plus the first order correction from flat space to the full @xmath10 . in some sense this background sits half - way between flat space and @xmath10 .",
    "it resembles @xmath10 because it is a curved geometry with non - zero five - form flux , and it resembles flat space because remarkably , the free string theory in this background can be solved exactly in light - cone gauge @xcite ( the details will be presented in lecture  1 ) .",
    "furthermore it was realized in @xcite that the penrose limit of @xmath10 has a very simple description in terms of the dual yang - mills theory . in particular ,",
    "bmn related iib string theory on the plane wave background to a sector of the large @xmath11 limit of @xmath15 su(@xmath11 ) gauge theory involving operators of large r - charge @xmath16 .",
    "because string theory in the plane wave is exactly solvable , the bmn correspondence opens up the exciting opportunity to study stringy effects in the holographic dual gauge theory , thereby adding a new dimension to our understanding of gauge theory , gravity , and the holographic principle .",
    "light - cone string field theory , although somewhat esoteric , has emerged from a long hibernation because it naturally connects the string and gauge theory descriptions of the plane wave limit of ads / cft .",
    "light - cone string field theory is a very complicated and technical subject . in order to provide a pedagogical introduction ,",
    "most of the material is developed for the simpler case of the bosonic string , although we do mention the qualitatively new features which arise for the type iib string .",
    "the reader who is interested in a detailed study of the latter , significantly more complicated case is encouraged to refer to the papers @xcite , or to review articles such as @xcite .",
    "our goal here has been to present in a clear manner the relevant background material which is usually absent in the recent literature on plane waves .",
    "we start with a quick review of the remarkable duality between @xmath15 su(@xmath11 ) super - yang mills theory and type iib string theory on @xmath10 , referring the reader to @xcite for an extensive review and for additional references .",
    "this is the best understood and most concrete example of a holographic duality between gauge theory and string theory .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath12 super - yang mills theory is @xcite @xmath17 ^ 2   + { \\rm fermions } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the gauge field strength and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are six real scalar fields .",
    "all fields transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the @xmath12 superalgebra in four dimensions is very constraining and essentially determines the field content and the lagrangian  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) uniquely : the only freedom is the choice of gauge group ( which will always be su(@xmath11 ) in these lectures ) , and the value of the coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "this theory is conformally invariant , so @xmath21 is a true parameter of the theory .",
    "( in non - conformal theories , couplings become functions of the energy scale , rather than parameters . ) the symmetry of the lagrangian  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) is so(2,4)@xmath22so(6 ) , where the first factor is the conformal group in four dimensions and the second group is the so(6 ) r - symmetry group which acts on the six scalar fields in the obvious way .    on the other side of the duality",
    "we have type iib string theory on the @xmath10 spacetime , whose metric can be written as @xmath23 this is a solution of the iib equations of motion with constant string coupling @xmath24 and five - form field strength @xmath25 the isometry group of the spacetime is so(2,4)@xmath22so(6 ) , where the first factor is the isometry of @xmath26 and the second factor is the isometry of @xmath27 .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , there is a one - to - one correspondence between single - trace operators @xmath28 in the gauge theory and fields @xmath29 in ads .",
    "the holographic dictionary between the two sides of this duality is summarized in table  [ table1 ] , where @xmath30 is the t hooft coupling and @xmath31 is the string length .",
    ".the ads / cft correspondence for @xmath10 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it will be very convenient to define the quantities @xmath32 which remain finite in the bmn limit . also , we will refer to those operators with @xmath33 and finite @xmath34 as ` bmn operators . '    in table  [ table2 ] we have introduced the parameter @xmath35 by rescaling @xmath36 as discussed above .",
    "the question mark in table  [ table2 ] indicates that we are still looking for a nice way to characterize this limit of the gauge theory . in other words",
    ", what precisely does it mean to ` truncate ' the theory to a certain class of operators ; or , turned around : is there a simple description of the sector of the gauge theory which is dual to iib string theory on a plane wave ?",
    "the most exciting aspect of the bmn correspondence is that the free iib string on the plane wave background is exactly solvable .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , string theory on @xmath10 is in contrast rather complicated .    in light cone gauge ,",
    "the worldsheet theory for iib strings on the plane wave background ( green - schwarz action ) is simply @xcite @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the bosonic sigma model coordinates , @xmath40 is a complex majorana spinor on the worldsheet and a positive chirality so(8 ) spinor under rotations in the transverse directions , and @xmath41 .",
    "the action  ( [ eq : wsact ] ) simply describes eight massive bosons and eight massive fermions , so it is trivially solvable .",
    "let us consider here only bosonic excitations .",
    "then a general state has the form @xmath42 and the hamiltonian be written as @xmath43 we have chosen a basis of fourier modes such that @xmath44 label left movers , @xmath45 label right movers , and @xmath46 is the zero mode .",
    "this convention has become standard in the pp - wave literature and contrasts with the usual convention in flat space , where the left- and right - moving oscillators are denoted by different symbols @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the alternate convention can be motivated by recalling that in flat space , the worldsheet theory remains a conformal field theory even in light - cone gauge .",
    "therefore the left - moving modes @xmath47 and the right - moving modes @xmath48 decouple from each other",
    ". however , in the plane - wave background , choosing light - cone gauge breaks conformal invariance on the world sheet ( because a mass term appears ) .",
    "therefore all of the modes couple to each other , so there is no advantage to introducing a notation which treats left- and right - movers separately .    since this is a theory of closed strings , we should not forget to impose the physical state condition , which says that the total momentum on the string should vanish : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the occupation number ( the eigenvalue of @xmath51 ) .",
    "we remarked above that the so(8 ) transverse symmetry is broken by the five - form field strength to so(4)@xmath22so(4)@xmath52 .",
    "this manifests itself by the presence of @xmath53 in the worldsheet action  ( [ eq : wsact ] ) .",
    "however , the free spectrum of iib string theory on the plane wave is actually fully so(8 ) symmetric @xcite .",
    "one can see this by noting that @xmath53 can be eliminated from  ( [ eq : wsact ] ) by first splitting @xmath54 and then making the field redefinition @xmath55 .",
    "one should think of so(8 ) as an accidental symmetry of the free theory . since the background breaks so(8 ) to so(4)@xmath22so(4)@xmath52",
    ", there is no reason to expect that string interactions should preserve the full so(8 ) , and indeed we will see that they do not : the interactions break so(8 ) to so(4)@xmath22so(4)@xmath52 .",
    "before we return to the gauge theory , it will be convenient to rewrite the spectrum  ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) in terms of gauge theory parameters using the dictionary from table  [ table2 ] : @xmath56      we have seen that iib string theory on the plane wave background has a very simple spectrum  ( [ eq : gspec ] ) . in this section we will recover this spectrum by finding the set of operators which have @xmath33 and finite @xmath57 in the @xmath58 limit @xcite .    consider first the ground state of the string , @xmath59 . according to  ( [ eq : gspec ] ) this",
    "should correspond to an operator with @xmath60 .",
    "the unique such operator is @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 ( recall that we defined @xmath63 to be the u(1 ) generator which acts by rotation in the @xmath64@xmath65 plane ) . the first entry in the",

    "\\cr a_0^{i+4 }    d_i z   z^j].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to get higher excited states we can add more ` impurities ' to the traces .",
    "for example , a general state with @xmath72 is @xmath73.\\ ] ] the sum on the right hand side runs over all possible orderings of the insertions inside the trace .",
    "this sum is necessary to ensure that the operator is bps .",
    "we will always work in a ` dilute gas ' approximation , where the number of impurities is much smaller than @xmath63 , the number of @xmath74 s .",
    "so far we considered only bps operators in the gauge theory .",
    "these have the property that @xmath75 is not corrected by interactions , i.e.  @xmath75 does not depend on @xmath21 . according to  ( [ eq : gspec ] ) , these",
    "can only correspond to string states with the zero mode ( @xmath46 ) excited . in order to obtain other states",
    ", we can consider summing over the location of an impurity with a phase : @xmath76.\\ ] ] but the right hand side is zero ( for @xmath77 ) , because of cyclicity of the trace ! actually this is a good thing , because the string state on the left does not satisfy the physical state condition for @xmath77 .    in order to get physical states",
    ", we have to consider ( suppressing the @xmath6 transverse index ) @xmath78.\\ ] ] here @xmath79 labels the position , in the string of @xmath74 s , of the @xmath6-th @xmath29 impurity .",
    "cyclicity of the trace now implies that the right - hand side vanishes unless @xmath80 , and this is precisely the physical state condition for the string state on the left - hand side !",
    "the operator on the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : genstate ] ) is not bps when the phases are non - zero , so its dimension @xmath75 receives quantum corrections .",
    "one can check that in the bmn limit @xmath81 with @xmath16 , the contribution to @xmath57 from an impurity with phase @xmath9 is @xmath82 precisely in accord with the prediction  ( [ eq : gspec ] ) !",
    "this calculation was performed to one loop in @xcite , to two loops in @xcite , and an argument valid to all orders in perturbation theory was presented in @xcite .    at this point",
    "we have motivated that the spectrum of iib string theory on the plane wave background can be identified with the set of bmn operators in @xmath15 su(@xmath11 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "one point which we did not consider is the addition of impurities with @xmath83 , for example @xmath84 , which has @xmath85 .",
    "it has been argued that these operators decouple in the bmn limit ( i.e. , their anomalous dimensions go to infinity ) , and can hence be ignored .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "next we present the two parameters @xcite which characterize the bmn limit .",
    "something a little miraculous has happened .",
    "the operator  ( [ eq : genstate ] ) is not bps ( when the phases are nonzero ) , so its conformal dimension @xmath75 will receive quantum corrections .",
    "generically , the dimension of a non - protected operator blows up in limit of large t hooft coupling .",
    "and we certainly are taking @xmath87 here ( see table  [ table2 ] ) !",
    "however , note that  ( [ eq : genstate ] ) is bps when all of the phases are zero : @xmath88 . in a sense , then , we might hope that the operator is ` almost ' bps as long as the phases are almost 0 , or in other words @xmath89 for all @xmath6 . by",
    "` almost ' bps we mean that although the dimension does receive quantum corrections , those corrections are finite in the bmn limit despite the fact that @xmath90 .",
    "indeed this is what happens : in the formula  ( [ eq : gspec ] ) is it not the ",
    "t hooft coupling @xmath91 which appears , but rather a new effective coupling @xmath92 which is finite in the bmn limit .",
    "it is hoped ( and indeed this hope is borne out in all known calculations so far ) that this miracle is quite general in the bmn limit : namely , that many interesting physical quantities related to these bmn operators remain finite despite the fact that the  t hooft coupling is going to infinity .      in the familiar large @xmath11 limit of su(@xmath11 )",
    "gauge theory , the perturbation theory naturally organizes into a genus expansion , where a gauge theory diagram of genus @xmath94 is effectively weighted by a factor of @xmath95",
    ". in particular , only planar ( @xmath96 ) diagrams contribute to leading order at large @xmath11 .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the effective genus counting parameter for bmn operators is @xmath97 .",
    "the familiar intuition that only planar graphs are relevant at @xmath98 fails because we are not focusing our attention on some fixed gauge theory operators , and then taking @xmath58 .",
    "rather , the bmn operators themselves change with @xmath11 , since we want to scale the r - charge @xmath16 . as @xmath11 becomes large ,",
    "the relevant bmn operators are composed of @xmath99 elementary fields .",
    "because of this large number of fields , there is a huge number @xmath100 of feynman diagrams at genus @xmath94 .",
    "this combines with the @xmath95 factor to give a finite weight @xmath101 in the bmn limit for genus @xmath94 diagrams .",
    "in this lecture we will canonically second - quantize string theory in light - cone gauge and write down its hamiltonian , which will be no more complicated ( qualitatively ) than @xmath102 where @xmath24 is the string coupling .",
    "students of string theory these days are not typically taught that it is possible to write down an explicit formula for the hamiltonian of string theory .",
    "an excellent collection of papers on this subject may be found in @xcite .",
    "the light - cone approach does suffer from a number of problems which will be discussed in detail in the next lecture .    however , light - cone string field theory is very well - suited to the study of string interactions in the plane wave background .",
    "for one thing , it is only in the light - cone gauge that we are able to determine the spectrum of the free string .",
    "since other approaches can not yet even give us the free spectrum , they can hardly tell us anything about string interactions .",
    "although we hope this situation will improve , light - cone gauge is still very natural from the point of view of the bmn correspondence .",
    "the dual bmn gauge theory automatically provides us a light - cone quantized version of the string theory , and it is hoped that taking the continuum limit of the ` discretized strings ' in the gauge theory might give us light - cone string field theory , although a large number of obstacles need to be overcome before the precise correspondence is better understood .",
    "many of the fundamental concepts which will be introduced in this and the following lecture apply equally well to all string field theories , and not just the light - cone version .",
    "it is therefore hoped that these lectures may be of benefit even to some who are not particularly interested in plane waves .",
    "this portion of the lecture series is intended to be highly pedagogical .",
    "we will therefore start by studying the simplest possible case in great detail .",
    "here is a partial list of simplifications which we will start with :    * during this lecture we will consider only bosons . somewhat surprisingly ,",
    "fermions complicate the story considerably , but we will postpone these important details until the next lecture . the reader should keep in mind that the plane wave background is not a solution of bosonic string theory , so strictly speaking all of the formulas presented in this lecture need to be supplemented by the appropriate fermions .",
    "( the flat space limit @xmath103 does make sense without fermions , if one works in 26 spacetime dimensions rather than 10 . ) * since the bosonic sector of string theory on the plane wave background is so(8 ) invariant , we will completely ignore the transverse index @xmath39 for most of the discussion .",
    "it is trivial to replace , for example , @xmath104 in all of the formulas below . *",
    "finally , we will begin not even with a string in the plane wave background , but simply a particle in the plane wave background !",
    "a string can essentially be thought of as an infinite number of particles , one for each fourier mode on the string worldsheet .",
    "a particle is equivalent to taking just the zero - mode on the worldsheet ( the mode independent of @xmath105 ) . in flat space",
    ", there is a qualitative difference between this zero - mode and the ` stringy ' modes : the former has a continuous spectrum ( just the overall center - of - mass center - of - mass momentum of the string ) while the stringy modes are like harmonic oscillators and have a discrete spectrum .",
    "however in the plane wave background , even the zero - mode lives in a harmonic oscillator potential , so it is not qualitatively different from the non - zero modes .",
    "once we develop all of the formalism appropriate for a particle , it will be straightforward to take infinitely many copies of all of the formulas and apply them to a string .",
    "we consider a particle propagating in the plane wave metric @xmath106 the action for a free ` massless ' field is @xmath107 where we have defined @xmath108.\\ ] ] now let us canonically quantize this theory , so we promote @xmath109 from a classical field to an operator on the multi - particle hilbert space . the canonically conjugate field",
    "to @xmath109 is @xmath110 , so the commutation relation is @xmath111 = i \\delta(x^- - y^- ) \\delta(x - y).\\ ] ] let us pass to a fourier basis by introducing @xmath112 note : from now on we * define * @xmath113 in the supersymmetric string theory to be considered below , the supersymmetry algebra will guarantee that @xmath114 for all states .",
    "we will proceed with this assumption , although it is certainly not true in the 26-dimensional bosonic theory .",
    "the commutation relation is now @xmath115 = { 1 \\over p^+ } \\delta(p^+ + q^+ ) \\delta(p+q).\\ ] ] since @xmath109 is real ( as a classical scalar field ) , the corresponding operator @xmath109 is hermitian , which means that @xmath116 the hamiltonian can now be written as @xmath117 ( normal ordering will always be understood ) where @xmath118 is the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath119 ( we will always take @xmath120 . ) the subscript `` 2 '' in  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) denotes that this is the quadratic ( i.e. , free ) part of the hamiltonian .",
    "later we may add higher order interaction terms .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian may be diagonalized in the standard way : @xmath121 so that @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "it is important to distinguish two different hilbert spaces .",
    "the single - particle hilbert space @xmath124 is spanned by the vectors @xmath125 the operators @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath118 act on @xmath124 .",
    "the second hilbert space is the multi - particle hilbert space @xmath128 .",

    "the vacuum of @xmath128 , denoted by @xmath136 , is annihilated by all @xmath129 which have @xmath132 .",
    "normally in scalar field theory we do not introduce this level of complexity because the ` internal ' hamiltonian @xmath118 is so trivial .",
    "we may refer to @xmath124 as the ` worldsheet ' hilbert space and @xmath128 as the ` spacetime ' hilbert space , since this is of course how these should be thought of in the string theory .",
    "we now write the usual expansion for @xmath109 in terms of particle creation and annihilation operators : @xmath137 it is easily checked that the commutation relation  ( [ eq : phiccr ] ) follows from  ( [ eq : accr ] ) .",
    "note that we have written @xmath109 as simultaneously a state in @xmath124 and an operator in @xmath128 .",
    "this is notationally more convenient than the position space representation , @xmath138 which would leave all of our formulas full of hermite polynomials @xmath139 .",
    "writing the field operator @xmath109 as a state in the single - particle hilbert space has notational advantages other than just being able to do without hermite polynomials .",
    "for example , the equation of motion @xmath140 is just the schrdinger equation on @xmath109 : @xmath141    there is also a simple formula which allows us to take any symmetry generator on the worldsheet ( such as @xmath118 above , and later rotation generators @xmath142 , supercharges @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) and construct a free field realization of the corresponding space - time operator ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath144 ) : @xmath148 we already saw this formula applied to the hamiltonian in  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) .",
    "when we further make use of the expansion of @xmath109 into creation operators , we find the expected formula @xmath149 another trivial application is the identity operator  it is easily checked that @xmath150 again , the subscript ` 2 ' in  ( [ eq : gdef ] ) emphasizes that this gives a free field realization ( i.e. , quadratic in @xmath109 ) .",
    "dynamical symmetry generators ( such as the hamiltonian , in particular ) will pick up additional interaction terms , but kinematical symmetry generators ( such as @xmath146 ) remain quadratic .",
    "now let us consider a cubic interaction , @xmath151 where , for example , we might choose @xmath152 if we insert the expansion of @xmath109 in terms of modes and do the integrals , we end up with an expression of the form @xmath153 the functions @xmath154 are obtained from @xmath155 without too much difficulty : they simply encode the matrix elements of the interaction written in a basis of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions .",
    "we now adopt a convention which is important to keep in mind .",
    "because of the @xmath156 conserving delta function , it will always be the case that two of the @xmath156 s are positive and one is negative , or vice versa .",
    "we will always choose the index ` 3 ' to label the @xmath156 whose sign is opposite that of the other two .",

    "this tells us that light - cone string field theory is highly non - local in the @xmath271 direction .",
    "the plane wave background with @xmath273 has fewer bosonic symmetries than flat space .",

    "( in the supersymmetric theory , it has been speculated that supersymmetry might fix this overall function essentially to 1 , but this has not been proven . )",
    "the first step on this exciting journey into the details of string field theory will be a close look at the four - string scattering amplitude .",
    "we consider a @xmath276 string scattering process at tree level .",
    "this exercise will be useful for showing how to use the formalism of light - cone string field theory to do actual calculations .",
    "without loss of generality we can choose to label the particles so that 1 and 2 are incoming ( positive @xmath156 ) and 3 and 4 are outgoing ( negative @xmath156 ) and furthermore @xmath277 .",

    "we have inserted the light - cone propagator for the intermediate string 5 : @xmath281 by @xmath282 we mean of course the hamiltonian for string 5 : @xmath283 finally , the integral over @xmath284 enforces the physical state condition on the intermediate string by projecting onto those states which satisfy @xmath285    the full amplitude has two additional contributions . in the @xmath286-channel , we have first @xmath287 , and then @xmath288 : @xmath289 finally in the @xmath290-channel , @xmath291 and then @xmath292 : @xmath293    what are these things ?",
    "well , each @xmath294 is just a state in @xmath295 , the fourth power of the string fock space .",
    "if we want to know the amplitude for scattering four particular external states , then we just have to calculate @xmath296 ( summed over channels ) to get the scattering amplitude as a function of @xmath297 and @xmath35 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the harmonic oscillator algebra gives very complicated functions of @xmath298 and @xmath105 which need to be integrated over . actually performing this calculation is far outside the scope of these lectures ( see @xcite ) , but we would like to make one very important point about the general structure of this amplitude .",
    "let us denote @xmath299 \\}$ ] , which are the two dimensional regions over which the quantities @xmath300 must be integrated .",
    "there exists a particular map @xmath301 which patches together these three coordinate regions onto a sphere as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this much is of course obvious .",
    "let us define @xmath302 to be the image of the three individual @xmath303 , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 on the sphere , patched together via the moduli map .",
    "it turns out that in flat space , precisely in the critical dimension @xmath264 , the function @xmath302 on the sphere is continuous along the boundaries between the images of @xmath306 ( that is , continuous along the dark lines in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) , which means that the amplitude can be written as @xmath307      the right hand side of  ( [ eq : moduli ] ) has a very familiar form .",
    "when we studied string theory , we learned that in order to calculate a four - string amplitude at tree level in closed string theory , one inserts four vertex operators on the sphere .",
    "the positions of three vertex operators can be fixed using the conformal killing vectors , and one is left with some amplitude ( depending on the particular vertex operators inserted ) which must be integrated over @xmath308 , the position of the remaining vertex operator .",
    "the moduli space of a sphere with four marked points ( the positions of vertex operators ) is therefore the sphere itself .",
    "it turns out that the integrand @xmath302 on the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : moduli ] ) is precisely the integrand one would derive from the polyakov path integral in the covariant formulation of string theory .",
    "although we have studied only one of the most trivial possible amplitudes , the equation  ( [ eq : moduli ] ) indicates a very general feature .",
    "amplitudes calculated in light - cone string field theory , with any number of external states and at arbitrary order in string perturbation theory , are precisely equivalent to those calculated using the covariant polyakov path integral @xcite .",
    "this equivalence relies on two important facts :    * property 1 : triangulation of moduli space .",
    "* consider all of the light - cone diagrams which contribute to an amplitude with @xmath94 closed string loops and @xmath9 external particles @xcite .",
    "the diagrams will be labeled by @xmath309 parameters : @xmath94 ` @xmath156-momentum fractions ' , @xmath310 twist angles ( to impose the physical state condition on intermediate string states ) , and @xmath311 interaction times .",
    "the first important fact is that the moduli map provides a one - to - one map between this @xmath312-dimensional parameter space and the moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath94 with @xmath9 marked points ( the locations of the vertex operators ) . a mathematical way of saying this is that the light - cone vertex provides a triangulation of the moduli space @xmath313 .    * property 2 : the measure on moduli space . *",
    "the second important fact is that the integrand of the light - cone vertex , including all of the complicated structure involving the neumann matrices and determinants thereof , maps under the moduli map to precisely the correct integration measure which arises from the polyakov path integral !    the proof of these remarkable facts would take us too far afield , but we can not stress enough the importance of these facts , which are deeply rooted in the underlying beautiful consistency of string theory .",
    "in fact , this equivalence can be used to prove the unitarity of the polyakov path integral @xcite : although the path integral is not manifestly unitary , it is equivalent to the light - cone formalism , which is manifestly unitary !    we are now in a position to answer some questions which may have been bothering some students since the last lecture : why is it sufficient to consider a cubic interaction between the string fields , and why is it sufficient to consider the simplest possible cubic interaction , with only a delta - functional ( and , for example , no derivative terms like @xmath314/\\delta x(\\sigma_{\\rm i})$ ] ) ?",
    "the answer is that the simple cubic interaction is sufficient because ( 1 ) the iterated cubic interaction covers precisely one copy of moduli space and ( 2 ) the vertex we wrote down precisely reproduces the correct integration measure on this moduli space .",
    "we do nt need anything else !",
    "it is sometimes said that the symmetry algebra ( in particular , the supersymmetry algebra , for superstrings ) , uniquely determines the interacting string hamiltonian to all orders in the string coupling .",
    "this is a little bit misleading .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric theory one could take @xmath315 and then define @xmath316 , and as long as ( anything ) commutes with rotations and translations , one would have a realization of the symmetry algebra ! the symmetry argument , however , provides no motivation for considering only a cubic interaction .",
    "the true criteria are ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) listed above , and fortunately it turns out to be true that ( at least for the bosonic string ) , one can find a purely cubic action with properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "now , fact number ( 1 ) , that the cubic delta - functional vertex covers moduli space precisely once , is essentially a mathematical theorem about a particular cell decomposition of @xmath313 that holds quite generally @xcite .",
    "however , ( 2 ) can fail in subtle ways in certain circumstances .",
    "in particular , it can happen that one or more of the @xmath300 s has singularities in moduli space .",
    "a typical case might be for example that @xmath317 near @xmath318 , which is not integrable .",
    "this gives rise to divergences in string amplitudes , which need to be corrected by adding new string interactions to the hamiltonian .",
    "however , these interaction terms are always delta - function supported on sets of measure zero ( @xmath318 in this example ) in moduli space , and therefore they do not spoil the beautiful triangulation that the cubic vertex provides . as long as we do nt add any interaction with _ finite _ measure",
    ", the triangulation still works just fine .    * definition .",
    "* we define a * contact term * to be any term in the hamiltonian which has support only on a set of measure zero in moduli space",
    ".    * corollary . *",
    "all contact terms are divergent .",
    "proof : if they were finite , they would nt give any contribution , there would be no point to include them , since by definition they are integrated over sets of measure zero !    in flat space ,",
    "it is known @xcite that the bosonic string requires no contact terms , while the iib superstring is widely ( though not universally ) believed to require an infinite number of contact terms .",
    "the word ` believe ' can be thought of in the following sense : since the purpose of contact terms is to eliminate divergences ( and indeed we will see how they arise from short - distance singularities on the worldsheet ) , one can think of a contact term as a counterterm in the sense of renormalization .",
    "now , there are infinitely many such counter terms that one can write down for the iib string , and while some of them may have coefficients which are equal to zero , it is widely believed that infinitely many of them will have nonzero coefficients .    for example , in open superstring field theory , it was argued in @xcite that a possible contact term in the @xmath243-channel of the @xmath276 amplitude in fact vanishes .",
    "however , it was argued in @xcite that there is a contact term for this process in the @xmath290-channel . for higher amplitudes",
    "the situation is much more complicated and has not been addressed in detail .",
    "a non - zero contact term in the one - loop mass renormalization has been studied in the plane wave background @xcite and will be discussed in the next lecture .    for strings in the plane wave background ,",
    "the question of whether property ( 2 ) holds has not been addressed , mostly because we do not have the analogue of the covariant polyakov formalism in which we can actually calculate anything .",
    "first we would need to calculate this overall factor @xmath319 and then see if there are any divergences which give rise to contact terms .",
    "any of the contact terms in iib string theory in flat space will surely give rise to @xmath35-dependent contact terms in the plane wave background . in principle",
    "there could be new contact terms introduced which go to zero in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "certainly we do not know how to disprove such a possibility , but we believe this is unlikely : contact terms may be thought of as coming from short - distance singularities on the string worldsheet , but the addition of a mass parameter @xmath35 on the worldsheet should not affect any of the short - distance behavior .    in fact , it is more likely that the opposite is true : that there are infinitely many contact terms in flat space , but all but a finite number vanish in the plane wave background when @xmath35 is large @xcite .",
    "we will have more to say about this in the next lecture .",
    "let s go back to the beginning of lecture  2 , but add fermions to the picture .",
    "we consider now a superparticle on the plane wave solution of iib supergravity .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom of the theory are encoded in a superfield @xmath320 which has an expansion of the form @xcite @xmath321 where @xmath322 is an eight - component so(8 ) spinor ( @xmath323 is short for eight powers of @xmath322 contracted with the fully antisymmetric tensor @xmath324 ) .",
    "initially we allow all the component fields to be complex , but this gives too many components ( 256 bosonic @xmath325 256 fermionic ) so we impose the reality condition @xmath326 which cuts the number of components in half .",
    "note , in particular , that this constraint correctly gives the self - duality condition for the five - form field strength .",
    "when we second quantize , this hermiticity condition implies that the inner product on the string field theory hilbert space @xmath128 is * not * the inner product navely inherited from the single string hilbert space .",
    "instead , @xmath327 where the states @xmath328 and @xmath329 differ by reversing the occupation of all of the fermionic zero modes , i.e. if @xmath330 , then @xmath331 , etc .",

    "the action  ( [ eq : superaction ] ) of course may also be obtained simply by linearizing the action for iib supergravity around the plane wave background , and the spectrum may be obtained by linearizing the equations of motion around the background and finding the eigenmodes .",

    "the corresponding spacetime field is a linear combination of the trace of the graviton over four of the eight transverse dimensions , @xmath334 , and the components of the four - form gauge potential @xmath335 in the first four directions .",

    "the only important fact which you might want to keep in mind is that this spacetime field is * odd * under the @xmath338 symmetry which exchanges the two so(4 ) s : @xmath339 the full string theory hamiltonian ( including interactions ) commutes with the @xmath338 operator @xmath74 , and this fact together with  ( [ eq : ztwo ] ) can be used to derive useful selection rules for string amplitudes .",
    "when we promote the superfield to string theory , it becomes a functional of the embedding of the string into superspace : @xmath340 $ ] .",

    "the ` fermionic ' neumann matrices are easily obtained from the bosonic neumann matrices .",
    "from the preceding section one might have the impression that light - cone string field theory for fermionic strings is a relatively trivial modification of the bosonic theory .",
    "unfortunately , this is not true . in the fermionic theory",

    "now there is a simple argument ( see chapter 11 of @xcite ) which shows that the choice @xmath351 would be incompatible with the supersymmetry algebra .",

    "it is essential to note , however , that the last term in  ( [ eq : wssc ] ) is non - singular when acting on @xmath160 .",
    "this makes sense , since the parameter @xmath35 introduces a scale in the worldsheet theory , but this should not affect the short distance physics .",
    "therefore the functional form of the prefactor has essentially the same form as in flat space ( there are subtleties in passing from the functional representation to the oscillator representation , though ) .",
    "we have shown that in the functional representation , the cubic interaction between three string super - fields is * not * given simply by the delta - functionals @xmath366 \\delta [ \\theta_1(\\sigma ) + \\theta_2(\\sigma ) - \\theta_3(\\sigma ) ] \\prod_{r=1}^3 \\phi [ x_r(\\sigma ) , \\theta_r(\\sigma)]\\ ] ] in addition , there is a complicated combination of functional derivatives acting on the @xmath109 fields , inserted at the point @xmath367 where the strings split .",
    "this interaction point operator is sometimes called the ` prefactor ' .",
    "the presence of this prefactor is associated with the picture changing operator in the covariant formulation .",
    "the prefactor @xmath361 is an operator of weight @xmath368 , which means that at short distances we have @xmath369 .",
    "( in light - cone gauge we do nt have a conformal field theory in the pp - wave , so by ` weight ' we simply mean the strength of the coincident singularity . ) a light - cone string diagram in which two ( or more ) of these prefactors come very close to each other will therefore be divergent .",
    "the simplest example occurs in the two - particle amplitude at one loop ( i.e. , a contribution to the one - loop mass renormalization ) , shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "this amplitude has been studied in the @xmath254 limit of the plane wave background in @xcite .",
    "this amplitude has an integral @xmath370 over the schwinger parameter giving the light - cone time between the splitting and joining ( think of it as coming from the propagator  ( [ eq : propagator ] ) for the intermediate state ) , but the integrand is divergent like @xmath371 due to the colliding prefactors .",
    "it is clear that at higher order in the string coupling ( and/or with more external states ) , we can draw diagrams which have arbitrarily many colliding prefactors .",
    "these divergent contributions to string amplitudes must be rendered finite by the introduction of ( divergent ) contact interactions as discussed in the previous lecture .",
    "the belief is that there is a unique set of contact interactions which preserves all the symmetries ( lorentz invariance , supersymmetry ) and which renders all amplitudes finite . but these contact terms are very unwieldy , and almost impossible to calculate explicitly , so they havent really been studied in very much detail",
    ".    we will have a little bit more to say about these contact terms below .",
    "in past couple of lectures we have demonstrated how to determine the light - cone hamiltonian of second - quantized iib string theory in the plane wave background .",
    "the two remaining ambiguities are ( 1 ) that we have not determined some overall factor @xmath319 that appears in the cubic coupling , and ( 2 ) that there are ( probably ) infinitely many contact counterterms which need to be added to the action . in principle ( although probably not in practice ) , the light - cone string field theory approach allows one to calculate @xmath40-matrix elements to arbitrary order in the string coupling via a quite straightforward hamiltonian approach : there is a ( large ) hilbert space of states , with a light - cone hamiltonian acting on it , and one can easily apply the rules of quantum mechanical perturbation theory to give the @xmath40-matrix @xmath372 is the transition operator @xmath373 which is usually calculated via the born series @xmath374 where @xmath375 is the ` bare ' propagator .    typically , the @xmath40-matrix is the only good ` observable ' of string theory .",
    "local observables are not allowed because string theory is a theory of quantum gravity , and in particular has diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the question is then , how is the string @xmath40-matrix encoded in the bmn limit of @xmath376 yang - mills theory ?",
    "note that we are not talking about the @xmath40-matrix of the gauge theory ( which does nt exist , since it is a conformal field theory ) .",
    "instead , the question is about how the string theory @xmath40-matrix can be extracted from the bmn limit of the gauge theory .",
    "it has been emphasized by a number of authors that it can be useful to think of gauge theory in the bmn limit as a quantum mechanical system @xcite .",
    "there is a space of states ( the bmn operators ) , an inner product ( the free gauge theory two - point function ) , and a hamiltonian , given by @xmath57 .",
    "perturbation theory in the gauge theory organizes itself into the two parameters @xmath377 which are respectively the effective t hooft coupling and the effective genus counting parameter , respectively .",
    "recall that the spectrum of bmn operators takes the following form @xmath378 where @xmath185 is the number of impurities with phase @xmath9 . to one - loop",
    ", the gauge theory hamiltonian @xmath379 takes the following form @xcite @xmath380 where @xmath381 and @xmath382 respectively increase and decrease the number of traces .",
    "that is , if we act with @xmath381 on a @xmath383-trace operator , then it ` splits ' one of the traces so that we get a @xmath384-trace operator .",
    "similarly @xmath382 ` joins ' two traces .",
    "the first two terms in  ( [ eq : gth ] ) are clearly just the first two terms in  ( [ eq : spec ] ) , expanded to order @xmath86 , so we have labeled them @xmath385  they constitute the ` free ' hamiltonian .",
    "the third term in  ( [ eq : gth ] ) has the structure of a three - string vertex , and incorporates the string interactions , so we have labeled this term @xmath155 .",
    "the next step is to recall that we should keep in mind the basis transformation that appeared in the lectures of h.  verlinde in this school . in our first lecture",
    "we identified a precise correspondence between single - trace operators in the gauge theory and states in string theory .",
    "it is natural therefore to identify a double - trace operator in the gauge theory with the corresponding two - particle state in the string theory , etc .",
    "however this identification breaks down at @xmath386 .",
    "one way to see this is to note that in string theory , a @xmath383 particle state and an @xmath387 particle state are necessarily orthogonal ( by construction ) for @xmath388 .",
    "however in the gauge theory , it is not hard to check that the gauge theory overlap ( given by the two - point function in the free theory ) is typically given by @xmath389    it has been conjectured @xcite that one can write an exact formula , valid to all orders in @xmath93 , for the inner product : @xmath390 where @xmath1 is the simple ` splitting - joining ' operator of the bit model ( see table  [ table3 ] ) . the inner product  ( [ eq : ip ] ) is diagonalized by the basis transformation @xmath391 .",
    "therefore , we propose the following bmn identification at finite @xmath93 @xcite : @xmath392,\\cr ( a^i_n a^j_{-n})^\\dagger |0 ; p^+\\rangle & \\longleftrightarrow & s^{-1/2 } \\sum_{k=0}^j e^{2\\pi i k n / j } { \\rm tr } [ \\phi^i z^k \\phi^j z^{j - k } ] , \\cr & { \\mbox etc.}&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the multi - particle states constructed from the operators on the right hand side of this correspondence will have the property that @xmath383-string states are orthogonal to @xmath387-string states for @xmath388 . however , we have lost the identification of ` number of traces ' with ` number of strings ' .",
    "instead , we have something of the form @xmath393\\cr & & \\qquad\\qquad + g_2 \\times [ { \\mbox{$k{-}1$-trace operator } } + { \\mbox{$k{+}1$-trace operator } } ] + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is convenient to perform this basis transformation on the operator @xmath145 , to define what we will call the string hamiltonian @xmath394 , given by @xmath395 for some new interaction @xmath396 ( which is easily calculated ) .",
    "now @xmath394 is simply a non - relativistic quantum mechanical hamiltonian , and it is straightforward to derive from it an @xmath40-matrix .",
    "this @xmath40-matrix should be that of iib string theory on the plane wave background .",
    "it is important to recognize that this @xmath40-matrix is not unitarily equivalent to the @xmath40-matrix obtained from the hamiltonian @xmath397 @xcite .",
    "previously we compared contact terms to counterterms , and we saw how certain contact terms in the superstring come about from regulating singularities that arise when two operators collide on the worldsheet .",
    "one could imagine regulating the theory in some way in order to render these divergences finite .",
    "one natural regulator , which is suggested by both the dual gauge theory and the string bit model , is to discretize the worldsheet .    discretizing the worldsheet leads to a spacetime hamiltonian which depends on @xmath63 , the total number of bits .",
    "schematically , we might have something like @xmath398 where we suppose that @xmath399 are finite in the @xmath400 limit .",
    "when @xmath63 is finite , the cubic interaction @xmath401 will fail to precisely cover the moduli space , but the additional ` contact terms ' will be finite and will cover regions of moduli space of small but nonzero measure . in the continuum limit @xmath400 , the contact terms become infinite but restricted to regions of measure zero .    physical quantities ( such as @xmath40-matrix elements ) should of course be independent of the regulator @xmath63 . the precise way to say",
    "this is that the amplitudes obtained from @xmath402 differ from those obtained from @xmath403 , @xmath404 by something which is brst - exact .",
    "anything brst - exact integrates to zero over moduli space , so this is a sufficient condition for amplitudes to indeed be independent of the cutoff @xmath63 .",
    "the previous two paragraphs have been well - motivated , but not precise : in fact , we do not know how to make precise sense of @xmath405 in string theory .",
    "certainly discretized string theories have been considered in the past ( see for example @xcite ) , but including interactions is frequently problematic .",
    "the bit model @xcite is intended as a step in the direction of constructing @xmath405 .",
    "perhaps , however , the best way to make @xmath405 precise is simply to read it off from the gauge theory !",
    "comparing matrix elements of @xmath57 in the gauge theory to matrix elements of  ( [ eq : contact ] ) would let us read off the contact terms perturbatively in the @xmath406 expansion .",
    "in these lectures we have learned that the essence of light - cone string field theory is an interacting string hamiltonian which satisfies properties 1 and 2 from lecture 3 .",
    "furthermore , we learned how to construct a hamiltonian which satsfies these properties , except possibly for measure zero contact interactions for the superstring .",
    "we also learned a little bit about the bmn limit of the @xmath12 su(@xmath11 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "an obvious goal , which has been realized in a number of papers , is to check whether the bmn limit of the gauge theory can reproduce string amplitudes in the plane wave background .",
    "we now summarize the successses of this research program , and end the lectures with a list of open questions .",
    "following closely the original construction of @xcite in flat space , the three - string vertex for type iib superstring field theory in the plane - wave background has been constructed @xcite , including the bosonic and fermionic neumann coefficients , matrix elements of the prefactor , and even explicit formulas for the neumann coefficients to all orders in @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "matrix elements of the cubic interaction in string field theory have been successfully matched to matrix elements of @xmath407 in the dual gauge theory after taking into account the relevant basis transformation discussed above @xcite .",
    "this program is highly developed and further aspects of this approach have been studied in @xcite .",
    "all of the successful checks of this correspondence have been restricted to amplitudes where the number of impurities ( in the gauge theory language ) is conserved . for such amplitudes ,",
    "all calculations so far indicate that the gauge theory can indeed match the string theory prediction , even though we are in a large t hooft coupling limit of the gauge theory .",
    "the successful match works quite generally at first order in @xmath86 and @xmath93 , and at order @xmath408 ( when intermediate impurity number violating processes are omitted ) .",
    "although there is no obstacle in principle to pushing these checks to higher order , the light - cone string field theory becomes prohibitively complicated .",
    "since it is obvious that the repeated splitting and joining ( i.e. , @xmath383-trace operators to @xmath409-trace operators ) in the gauge theory provides , in the large @xmath63 limit , a triangulation of the string theory moduli space ( property 1 ) , these successful tests of the bmn correspondence amount to checking that the gauge theory also knows about the correct measure on moduli space ( property 2 ) , at least in some limits of @xmath86 and @xmath93 parameter space .",
    "we conclude our lectures with a partial list of open problems and interesting directions for further research .",
    "* explore the structure of the string field theory .",
    "* can we say more about light - cone string field theory in the plane wave background ?",
    "in particular , is it possible to determine the measure factor @xmath410 ?",
    "is it possible to fully calculate a 4-particle interaction , or a 1-loop mass renormalization ?",
    "what can be said about the contact terms in the large @xmath35 limit ?",
    "* does an @xmath40-matrix exist in the plane wave ? *",
    "see references @xcite .",
    "obviously , we have assumed in these lectures that the answer is yes .",
    "the existence of an @xmath40-matrix has several very interesting consequences which should be possible to check purely within the gauge theory .",
    "for example , it implies that the one - loop mass renormalization of any @xmath383-particle state should be equal to the sum of the one - loop mass renormalizations of the individual particles .",
    "this is because the existence of an @xmath40-matrix presupposes that the particles can be well - separated from each other ( in the @xmath271 direction ) . for the most trivial case , where one particle has 2 impurities , and the other @xmath411 particles are all in the ground state , @xmath61 $ ] , this has indeed been shown to be true ( it is essentially due to the fact that ` disconnected ' diagrams dominate over ` connected ' ones in the large @xmath63 limit ",
    "see @xcite for details ) .",
    "can this proof be generalized to @xmath383 operators , each of which has more than zero ( ideally , arbitrarily many ) impurities ?    * calculate the gauge theory inner product .",
    "* the gauge theory inner product is defined as the coefficient of the free ( @xmath412 ) two - point function .",
    "for example , in the simplest case of two vacuum operators it has been shown that @xcite @xmath413 { \\rm tr } [ z^j ] \\rangle = { \\sinh(g_2/2 ) \\over g_2/2}.\\ ] ] for bmn operators with impurities , the inner product has been calculated only to a couple of orders in @xmath93 .",
    "since this is a free gauge theory calculation , it reduces to a simple gaussian matrix model , with graphs of genus @xmath94 contributing at order @xmath101 . it should be possible to prove ( or disprove ! ) the conjectured formula that the inner product is given in general by @xmath414 , where @xmath1 is the splitting - joining operator of the bit model .",
    "* ` solve ' the quantum mechanics of bmn operators .",
    "* recent studies have uncovered hints of integrable structures in @xmath15 gauge theory .",
    "one interesting question is whether there is any more hidden structure in the quantum mechanical hamiltonian we wrote down .",
    "for example , one can check ( at least in the two - impurity sector ) that the interaction @xmath396 in the string hamiltonian @xmath415 commutes with @xmath1 @xcite ! are there any other hidden symmetries which will allow one to make progress towards solving this quantum mechanics ?",
    "* do higher - point functions play any role in the bmn limit ? * in our discussion we limited our interest purely to two - point functions in the gauge theory ( although we did consider two - point functions of @xmath383-trace operators with @xmath387-trace operators , but that contains only a tiny remnant of the information encoded in the @xmath416-point function ) .",
    "these two - point functions were interpreted ( essentially ) as @xmath40-matrix elements .",
    "it is natural to wonder ( as many papers have ) what ( if any ) role is played by the higher - point functions .    in the previous lecture we explained the correspondence between three - point functions , matrix elements of @xmath160 , and matrix elements of @xmath1 at @xmath417 .",
    "we avoided attempting to extend this correspondence to @xmath418 for the following reason . in a conformal field theory ,",
    "three - point functions of operators with well - defined scaling dimension have simple three - point functions .",
    "but bmn operators do * not * have well - defined scaling dimension when @xmath419 ! they are eigenstates of the ` free ' hamiltonian @xmath385 , but they are not eigenstates of @xmath379 .",
    "so in general , the three - point function of bmn operators looks like @xmath420 we do not know how to recover the @xmath421 , @xmath422 , @xmath423 dependence of  ( [ eq : three ] ) from the string theory side .",
    "another point to keep in mind is that higher - point functions of bmn operators typically diverge in the large @xmath63 limit @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative is to consider @xmath9-point functions where 2 operators are bmn , and @xmath424 operators have finite charge ( for example , @xmath425 $ ] ) .",
    "such an @xmath9-point function might be interpreted as an amplitude for propagation from some initial state to some final state , with @xmath424 other operators inserted on the worldsheet which perturb the spacetime away from the pure pp - wave background .",
    "the correspondence between spacetime perturbations and operator insertions can be read off from the familiar dictionary of @xmath10 .",
    "some calculations along these lines have been performed in @xcite .",
    "* define @xmath405 precisely and provide a string theory construction for it .",
    "* equivalently , * can continuum light - cone superstring field theory be honestly discretized ? *",
    "discretized string theories have been studied for a long time ( in particular by thorn @xcite ) , but it seems somewhat problematic to discretize an interacting type iib string . in particular , there are problems with the fermions . there is the usual fermion doubling problem ( see @xcite ) that was mentioned briefly in the lectures of h.  verlinde .",
    "there is also the basic question of how to implement the hermiticity constraint  ( [ eq : hermiticity ] ) , which in the continuum theory singles out the fermionic zero modes from the non - zero modes .",
    "however , a discretized string does nt really have any fermionic zero modes , there is just one fermionic oscillator on each ` site ' along the string , and the natural ` adjoint ' just takes the adjoint of each fermion at each site , in contrast with  ( [ eq : hermiticity ] ) .    * which quantities can be calculated perturbatively in the gauge theory ? * it is important to not forget that the bmn limit still involves taking the t hooft coupling to infinity , so the weak coupling expansion is not really valid .",
    "however , it is empirically observed that some quantities , notably the conformal dimensions of bmn operators at @xmath426 : @xmath427 may be calculated at small @xmath91 ( i.e. , in gauge theory perturbation theory ) and finite @xmath63 , and then extrapolated to @xmath428 where magically they agree with the corresponding string calculation !",
    "these quantities are not bps , so we had no right to expect this miracle to occur .",
    "the basic question behind the bmn correspondence is simply this : for which ( if any ! ) other quantities does this miracle occur ?",
    "for example , we commented that there have been successful comparisons of off - shell matrix elements of the light - cone hamiltonian , at one loop ( order @xmath86 ) , but we do nt know if this miracle will continue to hold for more complicated quantities .",
    "this question is essentially the same as :    * how is the order of limits problem resolved ? *",
    "the order of limits problem is that in the gauge theory , we want to expand around @xmath429 , which on the string theory corresponds to @xmath430 and seems to be quite a singular limit . in particular , several steps in the derivation of the light - cone string vertex depended on the assertion that at small distances on the worldsheet , the physics is essentially unchanged by the addition of the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "however this does nt really make sense if @xmath35 is strictly infinity .    in particular",
    ", the prefactor of the superstring is a local operator insertion at the point where the string splits .",
    "if we view the gauge theory as a discretized version of the string theory ( with @xmath63 ` bits ' ) , how can the prefactor possibly be recovered when all calculations are necessarily done at finite @xmath63 , where there is no notion of ` locality ' on the worldsheet ?",
    "the successful checks of the bmn correspondence in the literature indicate that this problem is somehow resolved , at least to leading order in @xmath86 .",
    "it is not known whether this continues to hold at higher order in @xmath86 .",
    "certainly , nothing guarantees that the bmn correspondence has to work perturbatively in both parameters @xmath86 and @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , what we would like to do is to somehow calculate gauge theory quantities at finite @xmath91 and @xmath63 , and then take the limit @xmath431 holding @xmath92 fixed .",
    "this leads to the question :    * can we turn on finite @xmath91 in the bit model ? * one way that it might be possible to make sense of working at finite @xmath91 in the gauge theory is to work at finite @xmath91 in the bit model @xcite , with the hope that the bit model successfully encapsulates all of the relevant gauge theory degrees of freedom .",
    "let @xmath432 , @xmath433 denote the usual operators living on site @xmath166 on the string and satisfying @xmath434 = \\delta_{xy}$ ] . at @xmath435 ,",
    "these operators are just raising and lowering operators of the hamiltonian . that is , creating an excitation at some position @xmath166 on the string precisely increases the energy by one unit .",
    "however at @xmath436 it is no longer the case that the hamiltonian is diagonal in this ` local ' basis . instead",
    ", the hamiltonian is diagonal in the fourier basis , and the eigenmodes are not those which are located at some point @xmath166 on the string , but rather are those with well - defined momentum @xmath9 around the string .",
    "one can turn on finite @xmath91 in the bit model by doing a bogolyubov transformation ; the operator @xmath432 will now be expressed in terms of both raising and lowering operators @xmath437 and @xmath438 .",
    "the cubic vertex , which is trivial at @xmath435 because it is just the delta - function overlap matching excitations pointwise in @xmath105 , needs to be reexpressed in terms of the true eigenmodes of the @xmath439 hamiltonian .",
    "* is there another tool ? * rather than attempting to compare gauge theory calculations to the known but complicated @xcite formulation of string field theory , it might also be possible to derive a string field theory directly from the gauge theory  i.e .",
