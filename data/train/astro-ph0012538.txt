    "in the present series of papers we study the properties of the supercluster - void network as delineated by different types of clusters of galaxies , as well as the regularity of this network .",
    "so far the supercluster - void network has been studied in detail only using samples of abell clusters of galaxies ( abell 1958 , abell , corwin , olowin 1989 , hereafter aco ) . in the first two papers of this series we compared the distribution of abell clusters with clusters selected on the basis of their x - ray emission ( einasto et al .",
    "2001 , paper i ) and derived their correlation functions ( tago et al .",
    "2001 , paper ii ) . here",
    "we continue the comparison of samples of clusters of galaxies as tracers of the supercluster - void network , and now use the cluster catalog derived from scans with the automated plate measuring ( apm ) facility ( dalton et al .  1997 , hereafter d97 ) based on the apm galaxy catalog ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1996 ) .",
    "one reason to compare the abell and apm samples of clusters is the fact that power spectra derived from these cluster samples are different from each other . the power spectrum of abell clusters has a sharp peak around the scale @xmath3  @xmath1  mpc  or wavenumber @xmath4  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6(einasto et al .",
    "1997a , hereafter e97a , retzlaff et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter r98 ) .",
    "in contrast , the maximum of the power spectrum of apm clusters occurs on larger scales , @xmath7  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 , and it is flatter ( tadros et al .  1998 , hereafter t98 ) .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is not fully clear .",
    "an independent study of miller & batuski ( 2000 ) has shown only a mild feature on a scale @xmath8  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 , and the amplitude of the power spectrum increases toward larger scales .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare the distribution of abell and apm clusters of galaxies and to find how well these cluster catalogs can be used to investigate properties of the supercluster - void network .",
    "we shall use a cosmographic approach to describe superclusters and voids ; we shall also apply various methods to quantify the distribution to allow the comparison of observations with theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the cluster catalogs used : the latest compilation of redshifts of abell clusters by andernach & tago ( 1998 ) , and the published catalog of apm clusters by d97 .",
    "we derive selection functions for both samples . in section",
    "3 we find the multiplicity function of superclusters in the apm catalogs , compile a supercluster catalog for the apm sample , and compare the distribution of rich superclusters in the abell and apm catalogs ; a supercluster catalog based on abell sample was compiled in paper i. to characterize the distribution of clusters in quantitative terms in section  4 we derive the correlation function and power spectrum ; we also investigate the distribution of neighbors of superclusters .",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with results of other studies in section  5 .",
    "section  6 summarizes the main conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we give a catalog of superclusters constructed on the basis of apm clusters , using a redshift limit @xmath2 ; it is also available electronically at the web site http://www.aai.ee .",
    "[ figure1 ]",
    "for the present study we use the version of march 1999 of the redshift compilation for abell clusters described by andernach & tago ( 1998 ) .",
    "this compilation contains all known measured redshifts of abell clusters , based on redshifts of individual cluster galaxies , and redshift estimates on the basis of the 10th brightest member of the cluster according to the formula derived by peacock & west(1992 ) , for both abell catalogs ( abell 1958 and aco ) .",
    "we omitted from the compilation all supplementary , or s - clusters , but included clusters of richness class 0 . from this general sample we selected all clusters with measured redshifts not exceeding @xmath9 .",
    "if no measured redshift was available we applied the same criterion for estimated redshifts .",
    "this sample contains 2276 clusters , 1258 of which have measured redshifts .",
    "we consider that a cluster has a measured redshift if at least one of its member galaxy has a measured redshift . in cases where the cluster has less than three galaxies with measured redshifts , and",
    "the measured and estimated redshifts differ by more than a factor of two ( @xmath10 , ) the estimated redshift was used . in the case of component clusters ( a , b , c etc ) with comparable number of measured redshifts",
    ", we used only the cluster which better matches the estimated redshift .",
    "the apm cluster catalog by d97 contains 957 clusters , 374 of which have measured redshifts .",
    "this cluster catalog was selected using the apparent magnitude limit , @xmath11 , as a distance indicator .",
    "this distance indicator is similar to abell s magnitude @xmath12 of the 10th brightest galaxy in the cluster , used as distance indicator for the abell catalog . in the case of the apm catalog",
    "the rank @xmath13 is calculated from the sum of weights of galaxies brighter than @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the rank of the galaxy in the list ordered by magnitude ; @xmath16 is equivalent to abell s rank @xmath12 ( for details see d97 ) .",
    "the apparent magnitude limit @xmath11 corresponds to a limit in the estimated redshift , @xmath17 .",
    "[ figure2 ]    the distribution of both aco and apm clusters of galaxies on the sky is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we see that the apm cluster sample covers an area much smaller than the area covered by abell clusters .",
    "we shall estimate the effective area and volume of both cluster samples in section 5.2 .",
    "the decrease of the surface density of abell clusters towards the galactic equator is well seen , and later in this section we determine this dependence quantitatively . for the apm sample the surface density of clusters seems to be constant . however , as our analysis shows , here the surface density also depends on the galactic latitude .    as a first step to investigate the selection effects in both cluster catalogs we looked for the relationship between estimated and measured redshifts ( figure  2 ) . as noted above , the abell cluster sample was selected using an upper limit of measured redshifts , @xmath9 ; if , instead , no measured redshift were available , a similar upper limit was applied for estimated redshifts .",
    "an inspection of figure  2 shows that there exists a population of clusters with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is due to errors in estimated redshift .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that some clusters within our distance limit have estimated redshifts above this limit .",
    "the preponderance of points _ below _ the line @xmath20 is due to a preferred assignation of foreground galaxies to the cluster as compared to background galaxies .",
    "the apm cluster sample was constructed in a different manner . here",
    "clusters were preselected for the redshift observing program using an _ upper limit for the estimated redshift _ , @xmath21 .",
    "since estimated redshifts are subject to random errors , some clusters of this sample have measured redshifts exceeding this limit .",
    "similarly , some clusters that are located within the sphere of radius @xmath22 , are not included in the observing program since their estimated redshifts are larger than their true redshifts .",
    "this causes a large deficit of clusters near the far side of the sample , as we see below .",
    "[ figure3 ]    [ figure4 ]    we convert the redshifts into radial distances @xmath23 using the formula by mattig ( 1958 ) as in paper i. we adopt @xmath24  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the density parameter ( baryonic and dark matter ) in units of the critical density .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the spatial density of clusters of galaxies in concentric shells of thickness 20  @xmath1  mpc  in arbitrary units .",
    "densities were calculated from the number of clusters in respective shells , divided by the volume of the shell ( including regions not observed , thus this diagram can not be directly used to calculate absolute spatial densities of clusters ) . to avoid a very small test volume in our vicinity , the first shell is taken between radii @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "we are interested in the spatial distribution of clusters in superclusters of different richness , which is defined as the number of clusters in superclusters , @xmath29 .",
    "thus we plotted densities of clusters that belong to superclusters using a lower limit of supercluster richness , @xmath30 ( all clusters of the sample , including isolated clusters ) , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , i.e. clusters in superclusters with at least 4 or 8 members ( e97d ) .",
    "supercluster catalogs shall be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "they were constructed separately for all clusters , and for clusters having measured redshifts , both for the abell and apm cluster samples .",
    "figure  3 shows that the spatial density of all clusters in the abell catalog ( sample aco.a1 , see table  1 below ) has a maximal spatial density near the observer .",
    "the density decreases slowly up to a distance @xmath33  @xmath1  mpc ; at this distance the spatial density is approximately 75  % of its local value . at larger distances",
    "the density rapidly decreases to zero at the formal upper limit of the catalog that corresponds to a distance @xmath34  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spatial density of clusters located in rich ( @xmath31 ) and very rich ( @xmath32 ) superclusters follows the same trend , though at lower density levels , except at very small distances where the density of clusters in very rich superclusters drops to zero due to the absence of nearby very rich superclusters .",
    "we see also that on distances up to @xmath35  @xmath1  mpc  almost all clusters have measured redshifts ; the fraction of measured redshifts slowly decreases to about 50  % at @xmath36  @xmath1  mpc , and to about 30  % at @xmath37  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the spatial density of apm clusters shows a completely different dependence on distance .",
    "there are no apm clusters at small distances , @xmath38  @xmath1  mpc , and almost no clusters in rich and very rich superclusters at distances less than 150  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the overall density of the sample increases approximately linearly with increasing distance up to @xmath39 , and thereafter drops suddenly to zero at @xmath37  @xmath1  mpc  for clusters in superclusters ; there is a very sparse extension of the distribution of isolated clusters up to a distance @xmath40  @xmath1  mpc . at small distances",
    "almost all clusters have measured redshifts ; with increasing distance the fraction of clusters with measured redshifts continuously decreases ; near the maximum of the spatial density only 1 of 6 clusters has a measured redshift .",
    "the selection function in galactic latitude , @xmath41 , is plotted in figure  4 where surface density of clusters is expressed in arbitrary units . as argument",
    "we use @xmath42 , which is proportional to surface area .",
    "we do not distinguish between northern and southern galactic hemispheres of the abell sample and plot a merged distribution .",
    "figure  4 shows that the surface density decreases almost linearly with the decrease of @xmath42 .",
    "this effect was noticed already by einasto et al .",
    "( 1997b , hereafter e97b ) , and by e97d .",
    "conventionally the selection effect in galactic latitude is taken into account by cutting the sample at some latitude ( @xmath43 ) , and ignoring the latitude dependence at high latitudes .",
    "as we see , the latitude dependence exists also at high latitudes , and can not be ignored .",
    "figure  4 also shows that the difference between the latitude selection of all clusters and clusters with measured redshifts is small . a much steeper dependence exists for clusters in rich and very rich superclusters",
    ". we shall discuss this difference in more detail in section 5 .",
    "[ figure5 ]    the latitude dependence for apm clusters is shown in the right panel of figure  4 .",
    "the apm sample covers a restricted area around the southern galactic pole , thus the latitude dependence is steeper than in the case of abell clusters . for comparison",
    "we plot the latitude dependence for a model ; it consists of 4000 points evenly distributed on the sky between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , covered by the apm sample .",
    "figure  4 shows that the actual distribution of apm clusters has a steeper latitude dependence than the model ; in other words , the apm sample is subject to latitude selection effects similar to that for the abell sample .",
    "we shall discuss selection effects in more detail in section 5.1 .",
    "our previous studies of the correlation function and power spectrum show that on large scales these functions are determined by clusters located in high - density regions , i.e.  in rich and very rich superclusters ( e97b , einasto et al .  1997c , hereafter e97c ) .",
    "sparse samples , where superclusters can not be determined , have little or no influence on these functions .",
    "for this reason we shall use for further study only cluster samples in a volume within a limiting radius @xmath46  @xmath1  mpc , which corresponds to a limiting redshift of approximately @xmath2 . beyond this distance",
    "the spatial density of abell clusters decreases rapidly .",

    "we use supercluster catalogs constructed for all clusters ( including clusters with estimated redshifts ) .",
    "we show the distribution of clusters only in superclusters of richness 4 and higher .",

    "first , the skeleton of the supercluster - void network is essentially determined by rich superclusters ; poorer systems only add some fine details to the structure ( e97d ) .",
    "redshift errors do not affect the sky positions of the clusters but have an effect on their radial distance only .",
    "redshift errors have the same effect for superclusters as the velocity dispersion of galaxies in clusters : they elongate the superclusters in the radial direction .",
    "this effect may destroy real superclusters , if the separation between individual clusters in the radial direction , due to errors , is too large .",
    "using rich and very rich superclusters we have a higher probability to select real superclusters since it is very unlikely that errors bring isolated clusters together to form compact rich systems .    [ figure6 ]    figure  3 shows that in this region of the sky the distribution of clusters has two maxima , located at distances @xmath64 and 300  @xmath1  mpc  from us .",

    "other rich superclusters in the apm sample have only a few , if any , clusters with measured redshifts .",

    "integral ( [ eq4 ] ) yields for all non - negative power spectra a physically reasonable correlation function , but not all correlation functions submit non - negative results when one is calculating the power spectrum using formula ( [ eq3 ] ) . for this reason",
    "random and systematic errors of the correlation function can result non - physical values for the power spectrum .",
    "the most serious systematic error introduced by the cluster correlation function is due to the peculiar shape of cluster samples .",
    "the correlation function of clusters in superclusters has an oscillatory behavior : at large separations it contains regularly spaced secondary maxima and minima .",
    "maxima correspond to mutual separations between rich superclusters , and minima to mean separations of voids .",
    "if the sample occupies fully a large truly 3-d volume , then the amplitude of oscillations of the correlation function decreases almost exponentially , since on large separations rich superclusters located in different directions reduce the maxima and minima of the correlation function ( see e97c for a discussion ) . if the sample volume is not fully 3-dimensional , then the cancellation is less effective . in the extreme case ,",
    "if the sample is given in a cylindrical ( essentially one - dimensional ) volume , and if superclusters are regularly spaced along the axis of the sample , then the amplitude of oscillations of the correlation function does not decrease with increasing separation of superclusters .",
    "if we take a double - conical volume , as is the actual abell sample volume that contains no clusters near the galactic equator , then the cancellation of maxima and minima is partial . in a sample of such elongated form",
    "the amplitude of oscillations of the correlation function decreases with the increase of the separation more slowly than in the case of a fully 3-d sample .    to correct for such an effect we have to suppress the amplitude of oscillations of the correlation function on large separations , preserving the shape of the function on small separations .",
    "our experience has shown that an appropriate correction can be achieved if we multiply the observed correlation function by a factor @xmath97 , here @xmath98 is a parameter .",
    "we have checked the recovery procedure using correlation functions found via ( [ eq4 ] ) from analytical power spectra , distorted to increase the amplitude of oscillations , and thereafter corrected according to the procedure outlined above .",
    "this trial has shown that this procedure recovers the actual shape of the power spectrum rather closely . by a trial - and - error procedure",
    "we have found that a value @xmath99  @xmath1  mpcyields best recovery of analytical and observed correlation functions .",
    "[ figure9 ]    we have investigated also the influence of random errors on the correlation function . we added random noise to the distorted correlation function ; this noisy correlation function was reduced using the procedure given above , and fourier - transformed to obtain the recovered power spectrum .",
    "this test has shown that purely random errors have little influence .",
    "actually random , systematic ( due to sample shape ) and cosmic ( deviations of samples found for limited volume from the underlying large parent sample ) errors distort observed correlation functions in a more complicated way . thus the recovered power spectrum may still have some further peculiarities .",
    "the power spectra of aco and apm cluster samples found on the basis of their correlation functions are shown in figure  8 .",
    "here we have used correlations functions of all clusters and of clusters with measured redshifts only , samples aco.a1 , aco.r1 , apm.a1 , and apm.r1 . our experience has shown that our recovery procedure yields for real cluster samples meaningful results only in the wavenumber interval @xmath100  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 . on smaller scales",
    "the power spectrum is noisy and contains sections with negative values , on larger scales the error corridor found on the basis of the error corridor of the correlation function becomes very large . for both cluster samples",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum for all clusters is lower than for clusters with measured redshifts .",
    "this is probably due to observational errors which smooth the structure and reduce the amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "the shape of the power spectra for samples aco.a1 and aco.r1 is very similar .",
    "in contrast , the position of the maximum of the power spectrum of samples apm.a1 and apm.r1 is different : for apm.a1 it lies at @xmath101  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 , similar to the maximum of abell cluster samples , whereas for apm.r1 it lies at @xmath102  @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 .",
    "this difference is due to differences in correlation functions , compare with figure  7 .",
    "so far we have characterized the distribution of clusters using the correlation function and its fourier transform , the power spectrum .",
    "an additional measure is the distribution of distances between superclusters .",
    "while correlation functions and power spectra were calculated on the basis of cluster samples , we now consider the distribution of centers of superclusters .",
    "our main goal is to find the reason why the secondary maximum of the correlation function for the sample apm.r8 is shifted towards larger separations compared to results obtained with abell cluster and apm.a8 samples . as these functions are basically determined by the distributions of high - density regions",
    ", we shall derive the distribution of mutual distances of very rich superclusters with at least 8 members .",
    "for this we use the samples apm.a8 and apm.r8 . for comparison",
    "we also derive the distribution of distances between abell superclusters ( aco.a8 ) located in the region of sky covered by the apm cluster sample .",
    "integrated distributions of distances are shown in figure  9 .",
    "we see that there are practically no differences between the distribution of distances of abell and apm superclusters , at least if we use superclusters based on samples including all clusters .",
    "this result confirms our earlier findings , based on the correlation function , that abell and apm samples of all clusters have similar clustering properties .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of distances between rich superclusters , found for apm clusters with measured redshifts , is very different .",
    "the apm.r8 supercluster sample contains only two supercluster complexes , the horologium - reticulum supercluster and the sculptor supercluster located on opposite sides of the sculptor void ( figure  3 ) . by chance",
    "this is the largest cluster - defined void in our vicinity .",
    "these very rich systems have the strongest effect on the correlation function of apm clusters with measured redshifts .",
    "the distances between these superclusters characterize the size of the sculptor void between them , 185  @xmath1  mpc(the distances between supercluster centers are slightly larger , about 200  @xmath1  mpc ) .",
    "as we have shown above , the correlation function of apm clusters with measured redshifts has its secondary maximum exactly at the same distances .",
    "thus , this maximum in the correlation function is due to the mutual separation of these two superclusters . for comparison : the new abell cluster sample contains 31 very rich superclusters ( see table a1 in paper i ) and 16 voids cataloged by eetda and surrounded by rich superclusters . to summarize : the abell cluster sample ( and partly also the apm sample of all clusters ) characterizes mean properties of the supercluster - void network , whereas the apm sample with measured redshifts reflects properties of an extremely large deviation from the mean .",
    "in this section we discuss differences observed between two catalogs of clusters , and between statistics derived from these catalogs in more detail .",
    "we shall concentrate on two aspects of the problem : the selection function , and the correlation function .",
    "thereafter we shall compare both cluster samples for their capabilities in tracing the supercluster - void network .",
    "suppose that we study a certain volume in the universe and have in this volume a parent sample of clusters of galaxies .",
    "let @xmath103 be the actual number of clusters in this volume , @xmath104 , with a true limiting number of galaxies in the cluster , @xmath105 , varying from cluster to cluster .",
    "galaxies are chosen within a projected distance of one abell radius ( 1.5  @xmath1  mpc ) around the cluster center , and no more than 2 magnitudes fainter than the 3rd - brightest galaxy .",
    "this working definition was used by abell ( 1958 ) and aco .",
    "the cluster richness was then determined from the resulting number of galaxies counted in a circle of angular radius based on an assumed cluster distance , which was estimated from the apparent magnitude of the 10th - brightest galaxy .",
    "all quantities used in the cluster definition are subject to random and systematic errors ; thus the observed number of clusters , @xmath106 , differs from the true one . in general",
    ", the numbers of observed and true clusters of galaxies are related as follows : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are probabilities to detect a cluster of richness @xmath105 in the volume @xmath104 , given the various selection effects , and the errors in the parameters used in the cluster definition . here",
    "we assume that selection effects and errors @xmath15 are independent of each other .",
    "most selection effects decrease the number of observed clusters , i.e.  the respective probabilities are @xmath110 .",
    "errors in parameters of cluster definition have various effect ; they may both decrease and increase the probabilities @xmath111 .",
    "now we consider the effects of selection and errors in more detail .",
    "one well - known error is the one in background subtraction .",
    "every cluster is located in a certain environment ; thus the observed number of galaxies in a given cluster has to be corrected for the expected number of background galaxies .",
    "remember that abell ( 1958 ) estimated a local background for each cluster , while aco used an universal luminosity function .",
    "this correction is subject to errors : in a high - density environment the background may increase the observed cluster richness @xmath105 so that a poor cluster with @xmath112 is observed as @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath114 is the minimal richness of the cluster to be included in the catalog ; for abell clusters of richness class 0 @xmath115 .",
    "this systematic effect is enhanced in superclusters where clusters are affected not only by the universal background but also by overlapping clusters .",
    "this effect is detected in the abell catalog ; it makes the two - dimensional correlation function ( calculated for different radial and angular separations ) elongated in the radial direction and increases the correlation length ( sutherland 1988 ) . to avoid such a systematic error",
    "the background correction was made very carefully for the apm cluster catalog ( d97 ) .",
    "since the background correction is always influenced by random errors , the true minimal number of galaxies in clusters @xmath116 fluctuates around the accepted number @xmath114 .",
    "another well - studied selection effect is the dependence of the observed number of clusters on galactic latitude , @xmath41 .",
    "usually this effect has been taken into account only by exclusion of clusters at low galactic latitudes , @xmath117 ( sutherland 1988 ) .",
    "our analysis has shown that actually the spatial density of clusters is an almost linear function of @xmath42 , even at @xmath118 .",
    "this dependence can be described through the probability function : @xmath119 here @xmath51 is the value of @xmath42 where the density of clusters reaches zero .",
    "such a dependence was found by e97b , e97d , and in paper ii , and is confirmed by the present study . for abell and apm cluster samples investigated in this study the values of the parameter @xmath120 are given in table  1 .",
    "the latitude dependence can be considered as a random exclusion of faint and/or low surface brightness galaxies from clusters , so that the number @xmath105 decreases and a cluster may fall below the limiting number @xmath121 , so that the cluster is not included to the catalog . from statistical point of view clusters",
    "are included to the catalog only with a certain probability which decreases with the increase of angular distance from galactic pole .",
    "this process decreases also the number of clusters in superclusters ; thus the density of clusters in rich superclusters decreases with decreasing galactic latitude more rapidly than the density of all clusters .",
    "this dependence can be modeled using mock samples ; random exclusion model with probability function ( [ eq5 ] ) describes well the latitude distribution of clusters in superclusters of various richness ( e97c ) .",
    "the third selection effect is the dependence of the number of observed clusters on the distance from the observer .",
    "the mean density is usually found by appropriate smoothing of the observed number of clusters as a function of @xmath122 ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1992 , croft et al .",
    "the distance dependence of the spatial density of the cluster sample is due to several different effects .",
    "one effect is related to the difficulty to detect , especially a poor cluster , on large distances .",
    "secondly , nearby clusters cover too large an area on the sky to use standard cluster searching algorithm , and are thus omitted .",
    "further , near the limit of the sample errors of the estimated redshift influence the completeness of the sample . and finally , far from all clusters have their redshifts measured .",
    "the physical background of the difficulty to find a distant cluster is not clear , but probably it is due to detection problems of galaxies of low surface brightness at large distance .",
    "this reduces the number of galaxies found in the cluster below the threshold of @xmath114 .",
    "a similar detection problem may be the reason for the latitude dependence of the spatial density of clusters .",
    "formally this selection effect can be modeled as a random exclusion of clusters from a general sample of true clusters .",
    "following e97b and e97d , we use the linear probability function : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the probability to detect a cluster in our vicinity ( @xmath27 ) ; @xmath125 is the probability to detect a cluster at distance @xmath126 ; and @xmath126 is the limiting radius of the sample .",
    "we adopt @xmath127 for the southern part of the abell sample .",
    "table  1 lists the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath128 for northern and southern abell cluster samples .",
    "the second distance - dependent selection effect is due to random errors of estimated redshifts .",
    "clusters near the far limit of the sample are selected by the following criterion : both the abell and apm samples have been selected using an upper limit for the estimated redshift , @xmath129 .",
    "estimated redshifts are subject to random errors , with approximately log - normal distribution of dispersion 1.3 in @xmath130 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "this effect causes a deficit of clusters near the limit @xmath131 . on the other hand , some clusters within the limit @xmath129 have true redshifts exceeding the estimated one ,",
    "thus the density distribution has a large tail of clusters with @xmath132 but @xmath133 . to decrease this distance selection effect",
    "we apply for the abell sample an upper limit for the estimated redshift , @xmath134 , which exceeds by @xmath135 the redshift limit of the sample used for our structure analysis , @xmath2 .",
    "figure  3 shows that a rapid decrease of the spatial density of clusters near the limit of the sample can be avoided by this procedure .",
    "a similar cut would limit the apm sample to @xmath136 .",
    "instead we applied an identical cut for both cluster samples , @xmath46  @xmath1  mpc , at the cost of introducing this selection effect in the apm sample .",
    "the rapid decrease of the density of apm clusters beyond 300  @xmath1  mpc  is due to the sharp cutoff of the estimated redshift at @xmath22 or @xmath137  @xmath1  mpc  ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the third distance - dependent selection effect is due to difficulty to detect a very nearby cluster spanning a large area on the sky ( d97 ) .",
    "this effect is practically absent in the abell catalog ; only the virgo cluster was excluded from the abell catalog for this reason . for apm clusters",
    "this effect is enhanced by the absence in the apm sample galaxies brighter than @xmath138 ( which are overexposed and can not be measured automatically , see maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ) . due to this selection effect",
    "the apm cluster sample is very sparse at small distances of @xmath139  @xmath1  mpc  from us ; this explains also the absence of nearby rich superclusters in the apm sample , ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "so far we have discussed selection effects in samples of all clusters .",
    "as not all clusters have a measured redshift , another distance - dependent selection effect occurs in samples of clusters with only measured redshifts .",
    "the overall distance - dependent selection probability was calculated by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and croft et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by smoothing the observed redshift distribution .",
    "we use a different approach here , and calculate the combined effect of all distance - dependent selection effects for abell clusters by eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . for the apm cluster samples",
    "the combined effect of distance - dependent selections can be approximated by the following law : @xmath140 here we assume that at a distance @xmath58 clusters are detected with a probability @xmath56 .",
    "this probability function was used to calculate the comparison poisson sample for the apm clusters .",
    "values of the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath56 are given in table  1 .",
    "we summarize the discussion of selection effects in abell and apm cluster catalogs as follows .",
    "both cluster catalogs are subject to similar selection effects in galactic latitude .",
    "the error due to overlapping of clusters in superclusters is present only in the abell catalog .",
    "this error may distort the structure of individual superclusters ( and the cluster correlation function on small separations ) .",
    "however , it is of less importance for the study of the structure of the supercluster - void network , since it does not decrease systematically the number of clusters in superclusters .",
    "distance - dependent selection effects are rather small in the abell cluster sample , but very large in the apm sample .",
    "we shall discuss the influence of these selection effects on the study of the supercluster - void network in section 5.5 below .      in order to calculate the spatial density of abell and apm clusters of galaxies we generate poisson samples with selection function parameters as given in table  1 .",
    "we count the total number of particles , and the number of particles left after the selection functions have been applied .",
    "we obtain @xmath141  mpc@xmath142 for the aco.a1 sample and @xmath143  mpc@xmath142 , for apm.a1 .",
    "our value for abell clusters confirms earlier density estimate by e97d , but is about twice the value found by bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is our more detailed account of the selection function ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ) .    the surface of the sky covered by the sample of abell clusters , can be estimated , when we fix the effective galactic latitude limit of the survey .",
    "the large - scale distribution of high - density regions can be investigated if superclusters of richness @xmath31 are included in the sample ( e97d ) .",
    "figure  4 shows that the density of clusters in rich superclusters drops to zero at @xmath144 .",
    "thus we find that the abell cluster survey covers 8.8 steradians ( sr ) on the sky .",
    "the apm survey is limited by @xmath145 in declination and @xmath146 in right ascension , corresponding to an area of 1.47  sr .",
    "the volume occupied by the abell sample aco.a1 is @xmath147  mpc@xmath148 .",
    "the depth of the apm sample is from 50  @xmath1  mpc  to 350  @xmath1  mpc , corresponding to a volume of the apm survey @xmath149  mpc@xmath148 .",
    "here we are speaking on the volume of the _ sample _ of abell or apm clusters , not the volume occupied by abell or apm clusters themselves .",
    "we can also find the effective volume of both samples , defined by the number of clusters in the sample divided by the mean density ( we mean the true mean density which is calculated after the correction for all selection effects ) .",
    "we get @xmath150  mpc@xmath148 and @xmath151  mpc@xmath148 , for the aco.a1 and apm.a1 samples .",
    "the effective volumes of samples aco.r1 and apm.r1 are even less , @xmath152  mpc@xmath148 and @xmath153  mpc@xmath148 , respectively .",
    "we see that the selection effects reduce the effective volume with respect to the actual volume of samples .",
    "volume estimates show that the apm sample of all clusters occupies a volume about 1/6 of the volume of the corresponding abell sample aco.a1 .",
    "the volume estimate given by t98 is larger than found in the present paper , since t98 also included regions where the sample is very sparse .",
    "the cluster correlation function has been a subject of intensive studies starting from the pioneering work by klypin & kopylov ( 1983 ) and bahcall & soneira ( 1983 ) . in most cases",
    "the main purpose was the determination of the correlation length , @xmath50 , and the power index , @xmath154 , of the function ; for recent studies we refer to sutherland ( 1988 ) , efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , dalton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and croft et al .",
    "these authors have shown that the correlation length for apm clusters is smaller than that for abell clusters .",
    "this can be explained in part by the overlapping of abell clusters in superclusters ; a small intrinsic difference is also possible .",
    "as shown by real data and numerical simulations , the cluster correlation function depends on cluster richness ( bahcall & west 1992 , bahcall & cen 1992 , frisch et al .",
    "we also find a weak difference of the cluster correlation length for abell and apm samples . a much stronger dependence exists for clusters located in different environments : the correlation length for clusters in rich and very rich superclusters is much higher than for all clusters ( e97b , paper ii ) .",
    "this effect is due to variable density threshold in the definition of clusters in a different environment , for an analysis of this effect see einasto et al .",
    "( 1999b ) . in the present study",
    "we confirm this result ( see table  1 ) : _ there is no unique value of the cluster correlation length ",
    "it depends on cluster richness and environment_.    in the present study we have concentrated on the study of cluster correlations at large separations . for small separations the correlation function characterizes the distribution of clusters in superclusters , and for large separations the distribution of superclusters themselves , i.e. properties of the supercluster - void network ( e97c ) .",
    "the present study has confirmed earlier findings of e97b , that on large scales the abell cluster correlation function is oscillating , i.e. it consists of alternating secondary maxima and minima .",
    "oscillations are clearly detected if we use samples of clusters in very rich superclusters .",
    "there is practically no difference between the oscillatory behavior of samples of all clusters and clusters with measured redshifts , aco.a8 and aco.r8 , respectively .",
    "we find a period of oscillations of @xmath155  @xmath1  mpc , very close to the value found earlier .",
    "the apm cluster sample also shows signs of oscillations with the same period , if we use all clusters ( sample apm.a8 ) .",
    "if we use clusters with measured redshifts only ( sample apm.r8 ) , we see again a strong secondary maximum , but at much larger separation corresponding to the mutual distance of two dominating superclusters in the sample , the horologium - reticulum and the sculptor superclusters ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "this is the main difference between abell and apm samples of clusters .",
    "we continue the discussion of this difference in the next section .",
    "the principal statistic to characterize the distribution of matter on large scales has been the power spectrum of clusters of galaxies .",
    "our study confirms previous evidence ( e97a , r98 , and t98 ) for the existence of a real differences between power spectra of abell and apm cluster samples .",
    "the power spectrum of the abell sample has a peak on a scale of @xmath156  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "a peaked power spectrum corresponds to an oscillating correlation function ( e97a ) with a period of 120  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the apm cluster sample as analyzed by t98 has no feature on this scale .",
    "it has been argued that the apm cluster sample is free of the projection and selection biases known to affect the abell cluster sample ( t98 ) .",
    "for this reason the reality of the feature seen in the abell sample has been questioned ( postman 1998 ) .",
    "this brings us to the central problem of our study : how well do the abell and apm cluster samples trace the structure of the universe on large scales ?",
    "our study has shown that selection effects are more complicated than assumed previously .",
    "in particular , the selection function in distance depends on four different effects : the difficulty to detect clusters at large and small distances , the deficiency of clusters at large distance due to random errors in estimated redshifts used for the selection of clusters , and the selection caused by observing programs of cluster redshifts .",
    "our analysis has shown that the sample of all abell clusters ( aco.a1 ) is affected by distance - dependent selection effects only on very large distances ; this selection effect may be reduced if the sample is cut at a redshift of @xmath157 .",
    "in contrast , the apm sample with measured redshifts ( apm.r1 ) is affected by several distance - dependent selection effects within the range of distances of interest for the present study .",
    "t98 has compensated distance - dependent selection effects using weights for clusters inversely proportional to the mean spatial density of the cluster sample at its respective distance , following the prescription by feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 , hereafter fkp ) .",
    "t98 has also applied truncation of the sample at large distances , @xmath158   and 400  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the resulting estimates of the spectrum are similar , but the scatter of the power spectrum is smaller when cutting the sample at smaller distance .",
    "t98 argue that the sample of apm clusters with measured redshifts is representative for a volume of depth 400  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the figure  3 shows that the spatial density of the apm sample is very low at large distances .",
    "the same effect can be seen also in figure  1 of t98 ( note that t98 do not plot the spatial density , but the number of clusters in respective bins ) .",
    "the comparison of the spatial densities of the abell and apm samples in figure  3 demonstrates that the apm sample with measured redshifts becomes very sparse or diluted at distances @xmath159  @xmath1  mpc ; in the abell sample dilution becomes strong only at distances @xmath160  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the question is : is the use of weights sufficient to compensate for the strong dilution observed in the apm sample at large distance ?",
    "fkp argue that statistical properties of large scale structures can be fixed by using sparse samples if density perturbations are gaussian .",
    "the gaussian character of small - scale perturbations has been checked by the analysis of fkp . on large scales",
    "the problem is unsolved .",
    "szalay ( 1998 ) has demonstrated that the distribution of large structures ( supercluster - void network generated by voronoi tessellation ) may be destroyed completely by randomization of the phases of perturbations without changing the power spectrum .",
    "a sparse sample can not distinguish between a regular supercluster - void network and random distribution of high - density regions .",
    "this simple example shows very clearly that a very sparse sample is not suitable to describe the real supercluster - void network .",
    "our experience has shown ( einasto et al .",
    "1991 , frisch et al .",
    "1995 , e97c ) that dilution is not dangerous to locate high - density regions , as long as the main structural elements are not destroyed .",
    "the distribution of matter on large scales is dominated by the supercluster - void network .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the character of the mass distribution on large scales , rich superclusters must be present in sufficient quantities ( e97c ) .",
    "figure  3 shows that the abell cluster sample is complete enough to trace the network of rich superclusters up to @xmath161  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the apm sample with measured redshifts contains only two rich supercluster complexes within a distance of @xmath162  @xmath1  mpc .",
    "the mutual separation of these two supercluster complexes determines the shape of the correlation function and the power spectrum of the whole apm sample of clusters with measured redshifts .",
    "but this is not sufficient to trace the whole supercluster - void network .",
    "the sample is diluted and not all rich superclusters actually present can be traced in this distance range ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "this example shows that the use of the weights does not compensate for the lack of data .",
    "the apm sample of all clusters contains a sufficiently large number of rich and very rich superclusters , but most of the clusters in these superclusters do not yet have measured redshifts .",
    "the analysis of the sample of all apm clusters has shown that using this larger sample will probably yield a more representative picture of the supercluster - void network .",
    "t98 has used the apm cluster sample b for which a limit of estimated redshifts @xmath163 was applied , corresponding to the apparent magnitude limit of @xmath164 .",
    "this limit is implied by the limiting magnitude of the apm galaxy survey , @xmath165 , and the magnitude range @xmath166 $ ] to determine the cluster richness @xmath167 .",
    "croft et al .",

    "unfortunately , this much deeper apm cluster sample has not yet been studied to determine the power spectrum .    to conclude the discussion we can say that presently the abell cluster sample yields more accurate data on the structure of the supercluster - void network than the apm sample with measured redshifts  the effective volume of the last sample is too small .",
    "we have compared the spatial distribution of abell and apm clusters and cluster - defined superclusters in order to understand the similarities and differences between the correlation functions and power spectra of these clusters .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",

    "\\3 ) the sample of apm clusters with measured redshifts covers a much smaller volume in space than that of the abell clusters .",
    "statistical properties of the apm sample with measured redshifts reflect the distribution of clusters in this particular volume which is dominated by two very rich supercluster complexes .",

    "\\6 ) the use of weights in calculation of the correlation function and the power spectrum does not compensate for the lack of data .",
    "properties of the supercluster - void network can only be determined if data are available for a sufficiently large number of rich superclusters .",
