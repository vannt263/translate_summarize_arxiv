    "the mechanical feedback of galaxies ( or pre - galactic systems ) on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is a central topic in modern astrophysical cosmology .",
    "outflows from galaxies and pre - galactic systems affect the efficiency of further galaxy formation and evolution by shock - heating , displacing , and by changing the chemical composition ( and hence the cooling rate ) of the intergalactic gas .",
    "thus , an understanding of where and to what degree this feedback has occurred is essential for developing models for galaxy formation and the evolution of the igm .",
    "one observable consequence of this type of feedback is the enrichment of the igm with heavy elements : without this feedback the igm , which provides the baryon reservoir from which galaxies form , would be entirely free of metals . widely distributed metals are indicative of early feedback , but if the enrichment were limited to the environments of galaxies , late feedback or inefficient mixing would be implied .",
    "the volume filling factor of metal enriched regions is one component of this spatial distribution and for widespread enrichment a filling factor as large as 30% would be expected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that the volume filling factor at @xmath3 may be as low as 5% and still be consistent with observations of  in quasar absorption spectra at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the degree of metal enrichment of most of the universe is below the detection limit of current methods and data .",
    "progress has been made , however , by deriving what we can from the metals that are detected either directly or statistically in quasar absorption spectra .",
    "it has , for example , become clear that the igm metallicity is typically very low ( @xmath5 at @xmath6 ; e.g. , ) , that there is not much room for evolution of the column density distribution of  from @xmath7 to 2 @xcite and for evolution of the carbon abundance from @xmath8 to 2 @xcite , and that silicon is overabundant relative to carbon @xcite . in terms of the _ distribution _ of metals",
    ", it has been found that metallicity increases with gas density , but that there is also a large scatter in metallicity at any given density  @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely that density is the _ only _ environmental factor determining metallicity : the strong correlations of metal lines with both each other ( e.g. , @xcite ) and with lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that proximity to galaxies may be another important ( albeit not independent ) factor .",
    "this raises two important questions : ( 1 ) are most of the observed metals confined to the immediate surroundings of galaxies ? ( 2 ) can the hidden parameter `` proximity to galaxies '' account for the large scatter in the inferred metallicity for fixed density ?    one way to answer these questions is to compare the metallicity as a function of density for two samples of absorbers : those near to and those far away from galaxies . assuming , as expected for a photoionized plasma , that  ly@xmath9 optical depth is a proxy for the gas density , this measurement would be relatively straightforward if we could detect and obtain accurate redshifts for most of the galaxies that are near the line of sight to bright , high - redshift quasars .",
    "in this case we could simply measure metal line absorption as a function of  in regions of quasar spectra that are at various distances from galaxies .",
    "however , in practice we can not easily detect , never mind obtain accurate redshifts for , the vast majority of galaxies at high redshift , particularly if they are near to the line of sight of a much brighter quasar .",
    "we are therefore forced to do the next best thing and either : ( 1 ) accept that we are likely missing most of the galaxies responsible for the observed metal lines and check whether we can nevertheless see differences between the absorbers either near to or far from observed galaxies , or ( 2 ) use some type of absorption line as a proxy for galaxies .",
    "we have taken both approaches , but found the latter to be more productive .",
    "we could use strong  absorption as a proxy for galaxies ( this approach was taken by ) .",
    "however , this would complicate the interpretation because  absorption is observed to be reduced near an important fraction of starbursting galaxies @xcite and also because we are already using  absorption as a proxy for the gas density .",
    "we therefore chose to use strong metal lines instead .",
    "these have long been thought to arise in the immediate vicinity of galaxies ( e.g. , ) and strong observational support for this picture comes from the recent studies of @xcite , who found that the cross - correlation between  lines and lbgs increases with the strength of the  lines and becomes comparable to the galaxy autocorrelation function for column densities @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we set out the approach for separation of a quasar absorption spectrum into regions near to and far from galaxies using lbg positions and strong  markers , and",
    "describe the pixel correlation search for metals in those regions . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present results of the pixel correlation searches , and also describe an analysis of the scatter in carbon abundance in the different samples . finally , we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we search for absorption by ( @xmath11 ) and  ( @xmath12 ) as a function of  ( @xmath13 ) in a high - quality spectrum [ resolution @xmath14 ( fwhm ) , s / n @xmath15 of quasar q1422 + 231 ( @xmath16 ) taken with the high resolution echelle spectrograph @xcite on the keck telescope , and kindly provided to us by w.  sargent and m.  rauch .",
    "the spectrum was reduced as described in @xcite and continuum fitted as described in @xcite . to avoid proximity effects and confusion with the ly@xmath17 forest ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to absorption in the redshift range @xmath18 .    we make use of pixel optical depth statistics @xcite as implemented in @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "the pixel technique involves collating lyman @xmath9 forest pixels in quasar absorption spectra and pairing them with the pixels where absorption by a chosen metal species is expected .",
    "a variety of techniques are employed to minimise contamination , get around saturation , and to maximise the information derived in order to arrive at a dependence between  ly@xmath9 optical depth and apparent optical depths for  and .",
    "we refer to the metal line optical depths as `` apparent '' because they may suffer from some residual contamination and noise .",
    "these factors raise the apparent metal line optical depth and simulations indicate that they adequately explain the value to which this apparent optical depth asymptotes as @xmath19 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "statistical error bars are estimated by bootstrap resampling the observed spectrum after cutting it into chunks of 5   . in the process",
    "we preserve information on whether pixel pairs fall into the near or far sample .",
    "at least 25 pixels and 5 unique chunks must be available ( i.e. , at least 25 pixels must come from at least 5 different chunks of spectrum ) for a given  bin for the determination of a data point .    to investigate the importance of environmental factors beyond the gas density , we perform the search on sub - samples of pixels .",
    "we split the samples according to proximity to either observed lbgs or strong absorbers .    the positions and redshifts of lbgs near the line of sight to q1422 + 231 were taken from the online version of table  18 of @xcite .",
    "we use the procedure of @xcite to correct the redshifts using @xmath20 emission lines or interstellar absorption lines or both .",
    "this provides an rms scatter in the redshift of around @xmath21 .",
    "the locations of the nearest lbgs are indicated by arrows in figure  [ civsearchspectrum ] , which shows the apparent  optical depth as a function of redshift .",
    "the impact parameters of the galaxies [ which were computed assuming @xmath22 can be read off the right @xmath23-axis .",
    "the relative lack of galaxies with @xmath24 reflects the sensitivity function of the selection criteria used by @xcite .",
    "we therefore limit our analysis of absorption relative to the distance to lbgs to the redshift range @xmath25 , over which the lbg completeness is thought to be more or less uniform @xcite .",
    "pixels near to and far from lbgs are selected as follows .",
    "first , lbgs with impact parameter @xmath26 relative to the line of sight are each used to define a marker pixel with redshift @xmath27 .",
    "second , the full sample of pixels is separated into those with @xmath28 and those with @xmath29 .",
    "our choice for the maximum velocity difference is motivated by the observation that interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of high - redshift lbgs are typically blueshifted by up to @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such blueshifts are widely interpreted as a signature of large - scale outflows .    as an alternative to using the lbgs",
    ", we also use strong  absorption as a tracer of galaxies , motivated by the findings of @xcite , who compared the absorption seen in a number of quasar spectra with the redshifts of lbgs at small angular separations .",
    "adelberger et al.(@xcite ) conclude that where lbgs are closer than @xmath30 mpc comoving , the average  column density is @xmath31 .",
    "they also find that the galaxy-  cross correlation length increases with @xmath32 , becoming comparable to the lbg autocorrelation for @xmath33 .",
    "we use the fact that a  voigt profile line with line width @xmath34 has a central optical depth of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is typical for  lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence absorbers with @xmath2 should cluster to lbgs as lbgs cluster to each other , and absorbers with @xmath37 are expected to reside within @xmath38  kpc proper of a lbg .",
    "as with the lbgs , we split the pixels into subsets according to their velocity relative to the nearest marker pixel .",
    "marker pixels are in this case defined as those pixels with @xmath39 .",
    "all pixels within @xmath40 of a marker pixel are discarded from the search in order to exclude the possibility that any differences between the two samples are trivial consequences of the search method .",
    "this would be the case if most of the  in the near sample of pixels arose from the absorption lines that contain the marker pixels . in ",
    "[ subsec : strongciv ] we will use simulations to show that excluding the nearest @xmath40 is sufficient for this purpose .",
    "figure  [ civsearchspectrum ] shows the @xmath41 of those pixels near , far and discarded where @xmath42    figure  [ fillingfactors ] shows the fractions of pixels that belong to the near sample when lbgs ( _ left - hand panel _ ) or strong ( _ right - hand panel _ ) are used as markers .",
    "a lack of variation in the fractions of pixels with changing @xmath43 or @xmath44 reflects a lack of markers in that range .",
    "for example there are no markers in the range @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ searchlbg ] shows the results of the two sample search for   in the spectrum of q1422 + 231 .",
    "] when the redshifts of nearby lbgs are used as markers , and we divide our sample into the  near \" pixels that are within @xmath1 of a marker redshift and the  far \" pixels that are not . for each panel",
    "we take a different maximum lbg impact parameter @xmath47 .    in the left panel",
    "we use the lowest impact parameter that provides significant results for the near sample , @xmath48 comoving ( for smaller impact parameters the number of pixels and spectral regions in the near sample becomes too small to satisfy our statistical criteria ) . in the middle panel",
    "we use @xmath49 .",
    "this is the scale for which @xcite found that most of the  lines they detect are seen . in our case",
    "seven lbgs are within this distance from the line of sight .",
    "the right panel shows the case where @xmath50 comoving .",
    "such an impact parameter is chosen to represent the largest useful value for distance to lbgs since , at this redshift , this corresponds to @xmath51 along the line of sight just due to the hubble flow .",
    "there are no significant differences between the two samples for any of the choices of @xmath47 .",
    "this is also the case if we choose to disregard the non - uniform completeness and use the full redshift range up to @xmath52  , no signal is seen as the near sample does not extend to high @xmath53 . ] .",
    "this null result is somewhat surprising in light of the findings of @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that our redshift path searched is very small ( @xmath54 ) and that cosmic variance is therefore likely to be an issue .",
    "for example , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ civsearchspectrum ] that our upper redshift cutoff of @xmath55 ( above which the photometric selection of lbgs becomes highly incomplete ) results in the exclusion of many of the stronger  absorbers in this spectrum , so that we do not have sufficient data to investigate the regime @xmath56 .",
    "it would thus clearly be desirable to repeat this analysis using the full sample of @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that our pixel technique is much more sensitive to weak absorption than the method used by @xcite ( i.e. , direct detection by eye ) and much of the absorption seen far from lbgs may be weak .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation for our null result is that we are missing the vast majority of the galaxies from which the observed carbon originated .",
    "if metals were flowing out of galaxies at a constant velocity @xmath57 , then they would reach a distance @xmath58 in a time @xmath59 .",
    "hence , it is natural to expect the sources of the observed intergalactic metals at @xmath60 to be located well within @xmath61 comoving of the line of sight . while we find a large number of  absorbers ,",
    "there is only one galaxy that satisfies this criterion ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 comoving ) .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , given the fact that only the bright end of the luminosity function is observable and that accurate redshifts can only be determined for a fraction of these bright galaxies .",
    "it does , however , illustrate the need for a tracer of galaxies that can not be detected directly .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we have carried out a two - sample search for  and  absorption in regions near to and far from strong   absorbers .",
    "this approach was motivated by the work of @xcite , who found that strong  is a good tracer of galaxies .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ civsearchstrongtau ] we plot the median , recovered optical depth as a function of @xmath53 for pixels near ( _ triangles _ ) and far ( _ crosses _ ) from strong  absorbers . for comparison the results for the combined near and far samples ( _ solid lines _ ) and for the full sample of pixels ( _ dotted lines _ ) are also shown .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ searchlbg ] shows that the near doubling of the redshift path searched ( @xmath64 vs.@xmath54 ) significantly improves the statistics , particularly for high @xmath53 .",
    "the full sample and the combined near and far sample differ because only the full sample contains those pixels that are within @xmath65 of a marker pixel along with the marker pixel itself .",
    "as the threshold is lowered the results from these two samples become increasingly different as more pixels leave the combined near and far sample .",
    "the effect is pronounced for pixels with @xmath66 but is small for @xmath67 . since the systems of interest in this study are those with @xmath67 we can confirm that increasing the number of discarded pixels does not play a significant role .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels use threshold optical depths , @xmath44 , of 0.7 , 0.2 , and 0.1 , respectively , which covers the interesting range of values . using @xmath68 , would leave only the lowest  bins in the near sample with a sufficient number of pixels to satisfy our statistical criteria .",
    "the lower limit , @xmath69 , corresponds to the lowest optical depth which we can unambiguously identify as being due to , and also corresponds to the central optical depth above which  absorption lines cluster to lbgs as lbgs cluster to each other ( see  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "in addition , the number of pixels with @xmath70 becomes insufficient for @xmath71 because in that case many pixels fall within @xmath65 of a marker pixel .    in each panel",
    "the near sample consists of all pixels that are at most @xmath1 from the nearest marker pixel , which are defined by @xmath72 , and at least @xmath65 from all marker pixels .",
    "the far sample always consists of the pixels that are at least @xmath1 from all marker pixels .",
    "the fractions of pixels contained in the near and far samples are indicated in the panels , the fractions do not sum to exactly 100% because the combined sample still excludes those pixels that are within @xmath65 of a marker pixel .",
    "it is clear that , for fixed @xmath53 , the  absorption is much stronger for pixels in the vicinity of @xmath73 and 0.2 absorbers than for pixels that are at least @xmath1 away from such marker pixels . since @xmath74 \\propto \\log\\tau_{\\mathrm { c\\scriptscriptstyle{iv}}}$ ] for fixed @xmath53 if the gas if photoionized , we see that in these regions carbon may be overabundant by up to an order of magnitude compared to the global median .",
    "however , when we lower the threshold optical depth from @xmath75 to 0.1 , and thus increase the fraction of pixels in the near sample from 18 to 33 percent , the differences between the samples become insignificant .",
    "these results show that the  optical depth , which is thought to be a good indicator of the gas density , is not the only parameter that correlates with metal enrichment .",
    "proximity to highly enriched regions and ( by extension ) galaxies clearly also plays an important role .",
    "interestingly , the results for the far sample are always consistent with those for the combined samples and disagree with the full sample only for the highest bins ( @xmath76 ) , where the full sample becomes dominated by pixels within @xmath65 of a @xmath2 marker pixel .",
    "the median apparent @xmath41 is always substantially higher for @xmath77 than for @xmath78 , even if we only consider the 62% of the pixels that are at least @xmath1 from any pixels that have @xmath2 ( crosses in the right - hand panel ) .",
    "thus , it appears that carbon enrichment is _ not _ confined to the immediate surroundings of highly enriched regions .        at this point",
    "some scepticism would certainly be justified .",
    "since we are looking for  in regions selected by , are nt our results a trivial consequence of the search method ?",
    "figure  [ searchsim ] demonstrates that is not the case .",
    "the figure is identical to fig .",
    "[ civsearchstrongtau ] , except that we have now plotted the results for spectra drawn from a cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation in which the metals were distributed according to the observations of @xcite , who measured the distribution of carbon ( including the scatter ) as a function of density and redshift , as inferred from   absorption in a large set of quasar spectra .",
    "the simulation , the procedures for creating a spectrum that mimics the observations , and the metal distribution are all described in detail in @xcite ; for present purposes the key point is that the metallicity assigned to the gas depends on the gas density but _ not _ explicitly on the gas s proximity to galaxies .",
    "clearly , splitting the pixels into samples near to and far from strong  absorbers has no effect for these synthetic spectra .",
    "this demonstrates that the significant differences between the two observed samples can not be explained as an artifact of the search method .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that , for fixed @xmath79 , the @xmath41 distribution in q1422 + 231 is well - fit by a lognormal distribution of width @xmath80 ) \\simeq 0.8 $ ] . now that we have established that proximity to highly enriched gas is a second parameter , along with density , that controls the amount of absorption , it is interesting to ask whether this parameter is responsible for the large amount of scatter in @xmath41 for fixed @xmath53 . to test this ,",
    "we have determined @xmath81 near to and far from strong absorbers .",
    "briefly , the method used is as follows ( see @xcite for more detail ) . for each @xmath82 bin",
    ", we calculate many percentiles @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the number of standard deviations in a gaussian distribution ; for example , @xmath85 and @xmath86 would , respectively , correspond to the 50th and 84th percentiles in the @xmath87 distribution .",
    "errors on these points are calculated using the same bootstrap procedure as described in  [ sec : method ] . from each of these , we subtract @xmath88 computed from all pixels ( in the full undivided sample ) with @xmath89 ; in this way , we subtract off the effect of noise and contamination that is uncorrelated with @xmath82 .",
    "next , we fit a line to the function @xmath83 , which corresponds to a lognormal fit to the @xmath41 probability distribution ; the slope of the linear fit to @xmath83 is the width @xmath90 of the lognormal distribution , in dex . to obtain errors we repeat the procedure using bootstrap - resampled realizations of the spectrum .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig - scatfig ] for the threshold  optical depths 0.7 ( _ left _ ) , 0.2 ( _ middle _ ) , and 0.1 ( _ right _ ) . in all cases there is significantly less scatter in the near sample than in the full sample .",
    "in addition , for @xmath91 and 0.1 , there is some evidence that the scatter in the far sample is _ also _ smaller .",
    "these results suggest that variations in the distance to the nearest galaxy is responsible for a substantial fraction of the scatter in the metallicity of gas at a fixed density .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the strong civ markers can of course also be used in searches for other ions .",
    "figure  [ ovisearchstrongtau ] shows the results for .",
    "the redshift range searched , the threshold  optical depths , and velocity range are all the same as in the  search .",
    "the small differences in the fractions of pixels belonging to the various samples between figs  [ civsearchstrongtau ] and [ ovisearchstrongtau ] are due to differences between the numbers of  and  pixels discarded due to noise spikes , sky lines , and contamination .    as was the case for",
    ", there are significant differences between the near and far samples for @xmath92 and 0.2 , although the differences are much smaller than was the case for ( @xmath93 dex rather than 1 dex ) .",
    "in contrast to , we find no evidence for  absorption in any of the far samples , except perhaps tentatively in the very highest  bin ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "these results indicate that either oxygen enrichment is less widespread than carbon , or that away from the highly enriched regions oxygen is too weak to detect .",
    "the latter scenario appears more plausible and would also explain why the samples differ less in @xmath95 than in @xmath41 ( even if the difference in the true , median @xmath96 between the near and far samples were as large as a factor ten , we would not be able to tell if the median for the near sample is only @xmath97 dex above the detection limit ) .    .",
    "[ ovisearchstrongtau ]    it would be interesting to repeat this analysis at @xmath4 , where the pixel search has been shown to be able to produce a strong  signal @xcite .",
    "have in fact performed a two - sample pixel search for  at this redshift , but using strong  absorbers as markers rather than strong .",
    "they found that for @xmath98 the corresponding  is only detectable in the near sample , which in their case consisted of all pixels that are less than @xmath99 from a pixel with @xmath100 ( they do not give the fraction of pixels represented by this subset , but we note that for q1422 + 231 their choice of parameters would put 88% of the pixels in the near sample ) .",
    "we have searched for absorption by  and  absorption at @xmath18 in a high - quality spectrum of quasar q1422 + 231 .",
    "we can summarize our findings regarding the spatial distribution of metal enrichment in the intergalactic medium as follows :    * no correlations between metal line absorption and the positions of lyman - break galaxies are found .",
    "this may not be inconsistent with findings by others based on substantially larger samples which focused on stronger  absorbers .",
    "this part of our analysis was restricted to the redshift range @xmath101 - a comparatively narrow range required by the need for consistent completeness in the detection of lbgs .",
    "* we find a strong correlation between metal line absorption and the location of strong  absorbers , which @xcite found to be good tracers of galaxies .",
    "two - sample searches for  and  near and far from strong  absorbers demonstrate that the enrichment depends not only on the density , but also on the proximity to regions that are highly enriched ( and so proximity to galaxies ) .",
    "* the variations in proximity to highly enriched regions can account for a substantial part of the scatter in the abundance of carbon for a fixed  strength . * in searching for weak",
    "it is clear that the enrichment is much more widespread than the regions surrounding strong metal - line absorption , but for  the detection limit ( which is set by contamination from the  lyman series ) is too high to probe the enrichment in all but the most metal rich regions .",
