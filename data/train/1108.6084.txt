    "@xcite in xrd , and similarly in neutron diffraction ( nd ) and the mssbauer effect , @xmath6 is the mean - square displacement of an atom along the momentum transfer vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the instantaneous displacement vector . due to their strong variation with temperature , energy , and the geometrical structure of a material , accurate dw factors",
    "are crucial to a quantitative analysis of xas ; conversely , the lack of precise debye - waller factors is one of the main limitations to accurate structure determinations from experiment , especially for coordination numbers .",
    "various methods have been developed for obtaining these dw factors .",
    "phenomenological models , e.g. , correlated einstein and debye models @xcite are widely used in fitting but are often only semi - quantitative .",
    "more generally , they can be calculated in terms of debye - integrals over appropriate projected vibrational densities of states ( vdos ) . in small molecules ,",
    "explicit sums over modes can be used to calculate the vdos.@xcite such sums can also be used for periodic solids , both for crystallographic debye - waller factors and other thermodynamic quantities.@xcite for complex materials , however , calculating and summing over modes can be a computational bottleneck . as an alternative , a lanczos algorithm can be used to evaluate the vdos , starting from a dynamical matrix ( or hessian ) , that can be obtained either from force - field models,@xcite or first principles dft calculations.@xcite at high temperatures , brute force classical md ( or dft / md ) methods can also be used to obtain moments of vibrational distribution functions,@xcite but such methods can fail at low temperatures when quantum statistics dominate .",
    "first principles dft methods can also be computationally demanding , especially in complex systems .    in an effort to speed up the calculations , we present here a first principles approach based on an _ ab initio _ equation of motion ( aem ) approach using dft molecular dynamics calculations of displacement - displacement time - correlation functions .",
    "the method is a generalization of the equation of motion method @xcite for calculations of the vdos , which was adapted for calculations of debye - waller factors based on force - field models.@xcite however since accurate force - field models are not generally available , especially for complex molecules and solids , dft or other _ ab initio _ methods are needed . because @xmath9 depends primarily on the vibrational structure in the local environment around a given bond @xmath10 , the calculations can be carried out using relatively small clusters of atoms , without the use of periodic boundary conditions or other symmetry considerations .",
    "thus the approach is applicable to general aperiodic materials .",
    "the theory used in the present study is a first principles extension of the equation of motion approach @xcite for calculations of the vdos and thermodynamic quantities that can be expressed as debye - integrals over the vdos .",
    "our _ ab initio _ equation of motion ( aem ) extension builds in dynamical structure in terms of first principles dft calculations for a general structure , but does not rely on explicit calculations of the dynamical matrix ( dm ) .",
    "the technique builds in bose - einstein statistics , and allows one to calculate the dw factors and related thermal properties either in real - time or the frequency domain .",
    "the aem method has a number of computational advantages .",
    "it can be efficient even for large systems , since the method is local and diagonalization of huge matrices is not necessary .",
    "also the computational time scales linearly with the size of a cluster .",

    "when @xmath70 the weight factor is negative and reduces to @xmath71 at high temperatures and to @xmath72 at low .",
    "due to the exponential damping , the net time integration limit @xmath49 is usually several vibrational cycles and typically requires about 2535 time - steps per cycle for accuracy to a few percent .",
    "in addition , the singular behavior of the integrands in eq .",
    "( [ rhor ] ) and ( [ sigjt ] ) must be handled with care .",
    "this is especially important at low temperatures due to zero - point motion .",
    "thus in the time - domain , we further stabilize the long time behavior by convolving the time - correlation function with the inverse fourier transform of a smoothed , low - frequency cutoff function @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an appropriate cutoff frequency .",
    "in the frequency domain in eq .",
    "( [ sigj_2 ] ) we replace the very low - frequency region with a similar cutoff or a debye - model chosen to fit the very low frequency behavior of @xmath66 .",
    "all the integrals in our implementation of the aem method are evaluated using the trapezoidal rule , which is appropriate for highly oscillatory integrands .",
    "since the msrds are obtained from debye - integrals over the vdos , a precise determination of the spectra is not important , as long as the leading moments are accurate .",
    "thus , as an alternative approach , the projected density of states can be obtained approximately using the maximum entropy method ( mem).@xcite in this approach the vdos is approximated as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the sampling interval in the time domain and @xmath77 is the desired order of the approximation .",

    "although the mem method can be less efficient than the direct ft approach , we find that it can be more stable in the low frequency region , since it is less sensitive to non - periodic trends in the time evolution .",

    "other dynamical properties can be obtained similarly , by generalizing the seed - state @xmath59 appropriately.@xcite for example , when the seed state is defined as a single - atom displacement , the resulting correlation function yields the mean square atomic displacements @xmath99 in x - ray scattering dw factors .",

    "these codes were chosen on the basis of efficiency , although in principle , any program capable of nve dynamics can be interfaced with the aem codes used in this work .",

    "first , if a large number of msrds is needed , the computation of the full dm may be preferable since it yields all necessary dw factors with minimal additional effort .",
    "however , in most xafs analysis only a handful of local dw factors need to be known accurately while those for more distant shells can approximated roughly using correlated debye or einstein models .",
    "for example , in the case of the coordination shell around a metallic center in a complex biomolecule the aem approach can provide an efficient alternative to the lanczos dm approach .",
    "second , if a given msrd has similar contributions from low and high frequency modes , the md must have a short enough time - step to accurately represent the high frequency ( 2535 steps per cycle ) and a total run time with sufficient cycles of the low frequency ( 4 - 8 cycles ) .",

    "as expected , given the similarity of their vdos , the ft and mem values are in very good agreement .",
    "the direct integration rt approach also agrees well with the ft approach , at least for higher temperatures .",
    "the agreement with experiment@xcite is also quite good , with all theories falling within the experimental error bars for most of the temperature range .",
    "the largest disagreement occurs in the 80 - 140k region where other msrds ( w - w and zr - zr ) are known to have an anomaly that is likely related to the nte.@xcite",
    "we have introduced an _ ab initio _ equation of motion ( aem ) method for calculations of the msrds @xmath112 , needed for debye - waller factors in x - ray absorption , x - ray scattering , and related spectra .",
    "the method is based on calculations of displacement - displacement time correlation functions from _ ab initio _ density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations , using the velocity - verlet time - evolution algorithm .",
    "thus the approach avoids the need for explicit calculations of phonon - modes or the dynamical matrix .",
    "the aem method builds in bose - einstein statistics and yields the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) as either cosine fourier transforms of displacement - displacement correlation functions or through the maximum entropy method .",
    "the msrds and other thermal quantities such as the lattice free energy , are obtained in terms of debye - integrals over the vdos .",
    "alternatively , the msrds can be computed directly from the correlation functions by using the time - domain counterpart of the bose - einstein weight factor .",
    "application of the method to a number of systems show that the approach is computationally advantageous for large , complex systems , and is in quantitative agreement with other methods and with experimental results .",
