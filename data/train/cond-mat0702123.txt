    "an interacting ultracold dilute bose gas in a weak random external potential , which is homogeneous in the mean , represents an interesting model for studying the relation between bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity and has been the subject of various theoretical investigations in the last few years @xcite .",

    "the replica trick , on the other hand , has limitations of it s own by making the mathematical and also the physical description less transparent . for these reasons",
    "it would clearly be desirable to develop an alternative theory avoiding these shortcomings .",
