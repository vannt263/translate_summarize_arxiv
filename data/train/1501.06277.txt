    "in this paper we consider many - server parallel queueing networks in heavy traffic regime . despite the criticality ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , there may exist a scheduling rule , with high probability maintaining the system without waiting customers , for `` most of the time . ''",
    "called _ null controllability _ , such unusual phenomena occurs under the _ throughput sub - optimality _ of the underlying ( critically loaded in a standard sense ) , fluid model . in the current work",
    "we try to understand if the effect can still be achieved when the underlying fluid is throughput optimal , and conclude that it is not possible and throughput sub - optimality is indeed required .",
    "our model of interest consists of multiple customer classes , indexed by @xmath1 , and several service pools , indexed by @xmath2 , each consisting of many i.i.d .",
    "exponential servers .",
    "the servers rates depend on both the station and the class .",
    "a system administrator dynamically controls all scheduling and routing in the system ; see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the model is considered in the heavy traffic parametric regime , first proposed by halfin and whitt @xcite , in which the number of servers at each station and the arrival rates grow without bound , proportionally to some @xmath3 .",
    "typically , when analyzing such systems , one looks at the underlying _ static fluid model _ , obtained in the law of large numbers limit of the processes involved . according to @xcite , the so - called _",
    "static fluid allocation problem _ ( see section  [ sfm ] for the details ) should then be formulated to determine whether the model ( hence , the original system ) is under , over or critically loaded ; the latter being the proper foundation for the heavy traffic analysis . what one gets is a deterministic matrix  @xmath4 , where for @xmath5 , the entry @xmath6 represents the fraction of station-@xmath7 work dedicated to class-@xmath8 customers on the fluid level .",
    "consequently , the original network is called critically loaded if the optimized fluid takes @xmath9 of system capacity ; that is , @xmath10 for each @xmath11 .",
    "the class - station pairs @xmath5 , along which the service is possible , are called _ activities_. the activities @xmath12 for which @xmath13 ( resp . , @xmath14 )",
    "are regarded as _ basic _",
    ", _ nonbasic _ ) . in both @xcite",
    "the set @xmath4 was assumed to be unique as well as to satisfy the _",
    "complete resource pooling _ condition , requiring all vertices in the class - station graph to be connected via basic activities . under the uniqueness assumption ,",
    "the latter was shown to be equivalent for the graph of basic activities being a tree .",
    "the above set of conditions on the underlying fluid model has become standard for considerable amount of works in the conventional ( e.g. , @xcite , etc . ) and halfin  whitt ( e.g. , @xcite , etc . ) heavy traffic regimes , as well as in the more recent , nondegenerate - slowdown ( nds ) regime @xcite .        with the static fluid model set , an attempt is then made to prove that appropriately scaled ( halfin  whitt regime ) fluctuations of the queueing model about the fluid model converge to a diffusion . assuming no use of nonbasic activities , the pioneering papers @xcite were able to represent the scaled system dynamics as a controlled diffusion with a _ drift control _ ,",
    "thus being able to determine asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for the fairly large class of operational costs .",
    "it is a general understanding ( see theorem  2.1 in @xcite and theorem  [ 12121212 ] in this paper ) that by including the nonbasic activities one gets additional controls , this time _ singular controls _ , but the augmented controlled diffusion still remains to be fully analyzed .    yet , some partial results had been obtained .",
    "one of them , called _",
    "null controllability _ will be the focus of our attention .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , theorems 2.3 , 2.4 , it was shown that in the presence of nonbasic activities , some models are prone to a fairly unusual effect when a critically loaded system starts to behave like an underloaded system .",
    "more exactly , one can construct a policy , under which for any given @xmath15 all queues in the system are kept empty on the time interval @xmath16 $ ] , with probability approaching one ( a finiteness of the interval in @xcite is crucial , and was later supported by the results from @xcite indicating that the phenomenon is not possible in the long run ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that null controllability seems to be the feature of the halfin ",
    "whitt regime only  by its nature , it can not happen in the conventional single server asymptotics  and the _ conventional - like _ nds regime is not expected to have it either .    the results of @xcite were generalized and better explained in @xcite , attributing the null controllability to what was called _",
    "throughput sub - optimality _ of the underlying static fluid model , a situation , when ( static ) resources can be rearranged so that the total service rate becomes greater than the total arrival rate ; see section  [ to ] for the exact definition .",
    "throughput sub - optimality , it appears , may occur in wider class of fluid models and , even when the null controllability is impossible , can result in its weaker ( though still efficient ) version .",
    "namely ( theorem  1 of @xcite ) , for every finite @xmath0 , the measure of the set of times prior to @xmath0 , at which at least one customer is in the buffer , converges to zero in probability at the scaling limit .",
    "this brings us to the main objective , to understand the converse relation between throughput sub - optimality and ( weak ) null controllability ( theorem  [ main_thm ] ) .",
    "we show that the desired property is rooted in a simply formulated deterministic result ( theorem  [ elimin ] ) stating that a throughput optimal static fluid model does not become sub - optimal if its fluid amounts are modified along the so - called zero paths , simple paths @xmath17 from @xcite with signed weight @xmath18 .",
    "this gives a new interesting perspective on zero paths , normally not associated with abrupt changes of fluid material ; in contrast with `` unwelcome '' positive paths @xmath19 that increase the material , or negative paths @xmath20 , the existence of which , as shown in theorem  2 of @xcite , is equivalent to throughput sub - optimality .",
    "both theorem  [ elimin ] and its dynamic version lemma  [ estimate_main ] are proven for systems with either two customer classes ( and possibly more service pools ) or vice - versa .",
    "although the full version of theorem  [ elimin ] still remains unresolved , its simplistic nature [ checkable relations ( [ aa4])([aa5 ] ) ] allows us to partially generalize the results for arbitrary @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( theorem  [ main_thm_gen ] ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is rather straightforward , with the main result ( theorem  [ main_thm ] ) followed by its proof ( section  [ proof ] ) .",
    "sections  [ om][sfm ] provide all the prerequisites , while section  [ road ] is the roadmap for the proof .",
