    "experiments at the tevatron have observed a forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath0 pair production exceeding the nlo qcd prediction of 0.06 @xmath3 0.01 @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration found that the asymmetry is especially pronounced in the high invariant mass bin with @xmath4 450 gev . in this",
    "bin asymmetries of 0.475 @xmath3 0.114 and 0.212 @xmath3 0.096 were measured in the semileptonic @xcite and dileptonic modes @xcite , respectively .",
    "the standard model prediction as obtained with the mcfm code is 0.088 @xmath3 0.013 .",
    "taking into account the total @xmath5 cross section and event reconstruction efficiencies , it was found in @xcite that t - channel exchange of flavor - changing @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons can produce a sufficient asymmetry while fulfilling all experimental constraints . however , flavor - changing @xmath2 exchange implies the production of same - sign top pairs at hadron colliders , which faces strong limits from the tevatron and the lhc @xcite .",
    "one solution to the same sign top production problem has been proposed in @xcite by embedding a @xmath2 with couplings to up and top quarks in a non - abelian flavor symmetry .",
    "it was found that all experimental constraints can be avoided if the @xmath2 couplings are nearly diagonal in the mass eigenstate basis . in this",
    "talk we address the question if a similar gauge theory with a @xmath1 coupling to down and top quarks can explain the observed @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "explaining the tevatron @xmath0 asymmetry with @xmath6-channel exchange of a @xmath1 boson requires that down and top quarks transform into each other under the action of a non - abelian symmetry group . because of @xmath7 gauge invariance , this rotation can not involve left - handed fields .",
    "the minimal realization of this symmetry is therefore @xmath8 , under which the right - handed quark fields transform as a doublet .",
    "since the electric charges of the down and top quark differ by one unit , this new symmetry can not be added to the standard model as an independent @xmath9 factor .",
    "the simplest symmetry breaking structure @xmath10 produces two charged @xmath1 bosons , but incorrectly predicts hypercharges of @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an additional @xmath14 factor @xmath15 is therefore required , implying the existence of a neutral @xmath2 boson .",
    "this @xmath2 has flavor - diagonal couplings and does not contribute to the tevatron @xmath0 asymmetry or to same - sign top production at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "experimental limits on the @xmath2 originate from searches for dijet and @xmath0 resonances and the search for its suppressed dileptonic decay modes .    to reproduce the @xmath0 asymmetry , the @xmath1 coupling constant @xmath16",
    "is required to be large compared to the standard model hypercharge coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the relation @xmath18 then implies @xmath19 and therefore small mixing between @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",

    "as the @xmath1 coupling is however finite , some degree of mixing with the hypercharge @xmath20 is unavoidable and indeed necessary to obtain a charged gauge boson . to calculate the branching fraction due to hypercharge admixture ,",

    ", the @xmath2 is mostly the neutral @xmath8 gauge boson with only small hypercharge admixture .",

    "the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath2 are then suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the hadronic modes ( see fig.[fig : bree ] ) .",
    "coupling the @xmath1 only to right - handed down and top quarks is sufficient to generate a @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron . a possible objection to this construction is the ad - hoc flavor structure .",
    "we therefore briefly note that it is possible to embed the above theory into a left - right model with maximal mixing between the first and third family of right - handed quarks and asymmetric couplings to left and righthanded gauge bosons .",
    "the strong constraints from kaon mixing on the mass of the @xmath1 boson @xcite can be avoided by fine - tuning the right - handed analog of the ckm matrix to the off - diagonal unitary form @xmath36 in the mass basis , up to small additional mixing between the families .",
    "at hadron colliders , the @xmath2 is produced as a resonance from a @xmath37 initial state .",
    "the @xmath2 is therefore constrained by searches for dijet resonances @xcite and top pair production resonances @xcite .",
    "leptonic decays of the @xmath2 add additional constraints on the model . as noted above",
    ", the decay width to leptons is due to hypercharge admixture and suppressed by the small mixing angle .",
    "however , the limits on @xmath38 from tevatron searches are in the femtobarn range @xcite and therefore severely restrict the model parameter space .",
    "they become especially relevant for small @xmath2 mass ( i.e. large production cross section ) and large @xmath20 coupling constant , i.e. large mixing and therefore large branching fraction to dileptons .     model in @xmath2 mass vs. @xmath8 coupling parameter space .",

    "the @xmath1 mass has to be as light as 200 gev to produce a sufficient @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "if the @xmath1 originates from a left - right model as described above , all six quark flavors are charged under @xmath8 . the branching fraction to leptons at large @xmath16",
    "is then reduced by a factor of 1/3 .",
    "however , the conclusions from tevatron dilepton searches are virtually unchanged because of the additional @xmath44 production channel .    a light @xmath45 with couplings to leptons",
    "is strongly excluded by @xmath46 searches .",
    "such a universally coupling @xmath47 at the tev scale mass is however an attractive search target for the lhc @xcite .",
    "explaining the tevatron asymmetry with a @xmath1 requires splitting the mass of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons by at least a factor of three .",
    "since the mixing angle between the hypercharge and @xmath8 gauge groups must be small , the only way this can be accomplished is with a scalar vev in a large representation of @xmath8 . in the following section",
    "we will briefly outline why such a symmetry breaking setup is disfavored by theoretical arguments .",
    "let us assume that the right - handed gauge symmetry is broken by a vev in the lowest weight component of a scalar @xmath48 transforming in the complex , dimension @xmath49 ( i.e.  isospin @xmath50 ) representation of @xmath8 .",
    "neglecting the small mixing with hypercharge , the gauge boson masses are @xmath51 additionally , a doublet higgs @xmath52 is required to generate masses for the top and down quarks . ignoring this for the moment , we can ask what size of the higgs representation is necessary to reconcile the tevatron @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 constraints with the asymmetry from t - channel @xmath1 exchange . not overproducing @xmath0 at large invariant mass",
    "while generating a sufficient asymmetry requires a @xmath1 with a mass @xmath56 gev and a coupling @xmath57 . since the @xmath2 is excluded by dijet constraints up to 700 gev , we find @xmath58 the vev of the doublet @xmath52 contributes equally to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses and requires the dimension of @xmath48 to be even larger than estimated above .     and @xmath2 gauge boson propagators.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    @xmath48 is charged under the @xmath8 gauge group and therefore contributes to the gauge boson propagator ( fig .

    "fig : loop ] ) with strength @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the scalar loop contribution to the gauge boson propagator is comparable to the tree level term , implying the breakdown of perturbativity and the loss of predictive power of the theory .",
    "by combining gauge symmetry arguments and negative tevatron @xmath2 resonance search results , we conclude that the tevatron @xmath0 asymmetry can not be explained by t - channel exchange of a weakly coupled @xmath1 gauge boson .",
    "unitarity bounds on partial wave @xmath62 and @xmath63 scattering amplitudes require any theory of massive vector bosons to be either equivalent to a spontaneously broken gauge theory or result from strongly coupled new physics @xcite .",
    "the momentum scale at which new states are needed to unitarize scattering amplitudes can be estimated by @xmath64 generating a sufficiently large asymmetry requires @xmath65 200 gev and @xmath66 , implying . the absence of additional operators generated by strong dynamics",
