    "<S> possible experimental signatures are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _  the fundamental description of electron dynamics in a crystal and a uniform magnetic field involves orbital motion in a plane perpendicular to the field , along contours of constant energy @xcite as a function of crystal momentum * k*. this behavior can be significantly modified when tunneling from one trajectory to another becomes important , a phenomenon known as magnetic breakdown ( mb ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mb is important when the closest approach between @xmath0-space trajectories is on the order of the inverse of magnetic length , @xmath2}$ ] nm , where @xmath3 is the magnetic field in tesla . </S>",
    "<S> mb sometimes leads to the formation of open orbits , with dramatic transport signatures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> mb effects in bulk metals can be challenging to observe because saddle points in a band structure , where mb initially sets in as the electron energy changes @xcite , are often quite far from the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> recently , excellent candidates to observe mb phenomena have become available in the form of twisted graphene bilayers @xcite and graphene deposited on boron nitride substrates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two - dimensional systems can support large unit cells in real space ( `` moir patterns '' ) , and correspondingly small brillouin zones , for which critical points in the energy dispersion can be at relatively low energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such large unit cells have allowed the recent observation of the self - similar hofstadter spectrum @xcite , and may in principle nucleate unusual many - body states @xcite for fermi energies near that of a saddle point . </S>",
    "<S> these interesting behaviors are among the reasons that twisted bilayers have attracted so much attention @xcite .    a twisted bilayer graphene system is characterized by a rotation angle @xmath4 of the layers principal axes relative to an aa - stacked bilayer . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> , this relative rotation separates the dirac points associated with each layer by a distance @xmath5 . at low magnetic field and for energies just above those of the dirac points , momentum space trajectories are circular and surround one or the other dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> allowed areas enclosed by these trajectories are quantized in units of @xmath6 , are electron - like ( increase in energy with field ) , and yield a spectrum essentially the same as for uncoupled layers . at higher energy </S>",
    "<S> these trajectories approach one another , and interlayer tunneling becomes qualitatively important . </S>",
    "<S> to understand how the spectrum evolves it is crucial to recognize that the coupling results in _ three _ distinguishable , degenerate saddle points . in the presence of the field , as the energy is raised above that of the saddle points the semiclassical orbits break apart and reconnect . </S>",
    "<S> the new orbits are topologically distinct from the lower energy ones in that they enclose _ neither _ of the dirac points . </S>",
    "<S> instead they surround a local maximum and navely should be hole - like , _ i.e. _ decrease in energy with field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a very large accumulation of levels at the saddle point energy at high field . </S>",
    "<S> below we demonstrate by a careful treatment of the magnetic translational symmetries that such singular behavior is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum necessarily contains _ both _ hole - like and electron - like orbits above the saddle point ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> we expect this mechanism to be generic to band structures in which there is a sharp transition energy between hole - like and electron - like semiclassical orbits .    the model we adopt for the system , first introduced in ref . , contains one dirac hamiltonian for each layer and three interlayer hopping terms , two of which contain scattering momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these become reciprocal lattice vectors for the system ( see fig .  [ 2bz ] ) , and define the brillouin zone ( bz ) for the zero field energy spectrum . in the presence of a magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , energy eigenstates can simultaneously be eigenstates of two magnetic translation operators , but , as we show below , the resulting states can be represented as @xmath0-space trajectories only if one includes a minimum of two bz s in the representation . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be a crucial element in understanding the energy spectrum above the saddle point : one finds two `` star - like '' semiclassical orbits , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 2bz ] . </S>",
    "<S> a very unusual property of these orbits is that they involve periodic oscillations of the electrons between layers , and their quantization conditions leads to the interpenetrating electron- and hole - like levels . </S>",

    "<S> this behavior is also apparent in the surface states of crystalline topological insulators in a magnetic field @xcite .    the peculiar landau level structure and the associated semiclassical orbits in our model should have a number of experimental ramifications . for sufficiently clean samples , the level structure itself could be detected directly in tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cyclotron resonance @xcite brings another interesting perspective : since star - like orbits tunnel periodically between layers , electromagnetic waves with electric field perpendicular to the layers should couple to them and allow absorption , whereas in truly two - dimensional systems this would not be possible . </S>",
    "<S> ( preliminary calculations @xcite demonstrate that this is indeed the case . ) </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamically , converging hole - like and electron - like orbits at the saddle point energy should lead to cusp - like behavior in magnetic susceptibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , breaking the symmetry among the saddle points , for example by strain or a periodic potential @xcite , can in principle induce open orbits , which might be observed in transport as a metal - insulator transition .    </S>",
