    "lorentz gas models have been used historically in order to clarify the features of more complex non - linear kinetic equations .",
    "for instance , p. and t. ehrenfest @xcite introduced the so - called wind tree model , in order to discuss the _ stosszahlansatz _ of the boltzmann equation . in this paper",
    ", we will use a similar approach in order to study inelastic gases , namely low - density systems composed by a large number of moving macroscopic particles , themselves performing inelastic interactions .",
    "due to their inelasticity , inelastic gases dissipate kinetic energy .",
    "this implies that the granular temperature , defined kinetically by t@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 , where @xmath4 and * u*(r , t ) is the local mean velocity , asymptotically vanishes if the system is not supplied by an external energy source . before reaching total rest state",
    ", these systems usually reach a self - similar solution , i.e. form preserving solution whose time dependence occurs through the granular temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "such scaling velocity distributions have been observed in a large variety of kinetic models , and have been shown to generically highlight non - maxwellian features and overpopulated high energy tail @xcite .",
    "let us note that the specific shape of the tail may exhibit very different behaviours , depending on the details of the model @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show on simplified kinetic models that such high energy tails may originate from the fact that the average energy of particles depends on their collision history , i.e. on the number of collisions they have undergone in the course of time .",
    "this effect , that has no counterpart in the case of elastic interactions , is verified by direct simulation monte - carlo ( dsmc ) simulations of the non - linear inelastic maxwell models , and by focusing on a discrete time version of the dynamics .",
    "analytical calculations are also performed for a simpler linear lorentz model .",
    "in the following , we study scaling solutions in the context of the one - dimensional inelastic maxwell model ( imm ) . this model @xcite derives from a mathematical simplification of the non - linear boltzmann equation for inelastic hard rods @xcite , assuming that the collision rate may be replaced by an average rate , independent of the relative velocity of the colliding particles .",
    "we also assume that the system is and remain homogeneous in the course of time , so that the resulting kinetic equation writes :    @xmath6    where the primed velocities are the pre - collisional velocities , defined by the collision rule :    @xmath7    @xmath8 is the relative velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the restitution parameter @xmath10 @xmath110:1]$ ] measures dissipation of energy at each collision , and the elastic limit corresponds to the case @xmath12 .",
    "it is well - known that the scaling solution of [ imm ] reads @xcite :    @xmath13^{2 } } \\label{baldassari}\\ ] ]    where the granular temperature decreases like @xmath14 .",
    "recently , we have introduced @xcite a time discretized version of [ imm ] :    @xmath15    let us call continuous time dynamics ( ctd ) and discrete time dynamics ( dtd ) the models associated to [ imm ] and [ discrete ] respectively .",
    "arguments based on the central limit theorem show that any initial velocity distribution converges towards a scaling solution whose shape is gaussian in the case of dtd :    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the temperature after n collision steps , @xmath18 .",
    "one should stress that the transition from a power law tail [ baldassari ] towards a maxwell - boltzmann distribution [ maxwell ] is entirely due to the passage from a continuous time towards a discrete time description .",
    "the main difference between these two models follows . in dtd",
    ", every particle has suffered exactly @xmath19 inelastic collisions at time @xmath19 , so that it has dissipated the same fraction of energy on the average at that time .",
    "in contrast , in cdt , the constituents of the inelastic gas have performed different number of inelastic collisions @xmath19 at a given time t , distributed according to the poisson law @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that ensembles of particles , discriminated by their number of collisions , should be characterised by different quantities of energy on average , thereby increasing fluctuations of the particles energies .    in order to verify this possible explanation",
    ", we have performed dsmc simulations @xcite of the kinetic equations [ imm ] and [ discrete ] , based on their interpretation as a stochastic process .",
    "the cdt case is well - known and consists in picking a given number of random collision pairs at each step .",
    "the dtd case is based on the same algorithm , except that at each step , the n particles are distributed randomly into @xmath21 collision couples .",
    "this method ensures that each particle collides one and only one time at each step . at the end of each step ,",
    "the velocities are rescaled in order to keep the total energy constant @xcite .",
    "simulation methods have been verified by looking at the asymptotic velocity distribution , and checking the theoretical results [ baldassari ] and [ maxwell ] ( fig.[figure1 ] ) . in the case of cdt ,",
    "we have also highlighted a non - trivial relation between the number of collisions suffered by a particle , and its average energy . in order to evaluate this relation ,",
    "we have started a simulation from a maxwell - boltzmann initial condition , and let the simulation run during 50 collisions per particle .",
    "after that time , the simulation is stopped , the particles velocities are rescaled so that the average energy @xmath22 and we measure the average energy @xmath23 of particles having performed @xmath24 collisions .",
    "the results ( fig.[figure2 ] ) clearly show that the average energy of particles is a decreasing function of their number of collisions , thereby confirming the above discussion .",
    "lorentz - like models have already been applied to the study of inelastic gases , in order to show non - equipartition of energy for instance @xcite .",
    "these systems are composed by _",
    "particles _ that do not interact between themselves , and undergo collisions with randomly distributed static ( infinitely heavy ) scatterers . in this paper",
    ", we will consider a model which is very similar to the ehrenfest wind tree model @xcite :    @xmath25    where the pre - collisional is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "this kinetic equation has been shown @xcite to be related to the inelastic liouville equation @xcite and to population dynamics @xcite . in the following , we use an imm - like approximation in order to treat this kinetic equation ,",
    "i.e. we assume that the collision rate @xmath27 may be replaced by a mean value @xmath28 and we rescale the time scale .",
    "we call the resulting model the inelastic lorentz walk ( ilw ) :",
    "@xmath29    the right side equation is the kinetic equation for the characteristic function of the velocity distribution @xmath30 . in fourier space ,",
    "the discrete time version of the process reads :    @xmath31    whose solution is : @xmath32    let us stress that the stochastic process leaves the solution scale invariant , i.e. [ discretewalk ] is a self - similar solution",
    "whose form is that of the initial velocity distribution and whose temperature asymptotically vanishes .",
    "obviously , the discrete process does not lead to the formation of high energy tails , but this property ceases to be true if only a fraction p of the discs performs a collision at each step . in this case , the state of the system after one step writes : @xmath33 simple analytical calculations show that the kurtosis @xmath34 of the velocity distribution increases through [ semidiscretewalk ] whatever the initial velocity distribution and proportion p@xmath35 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the superposition of identical distributions with different temperatures @xmath36 , @xmath37 has a higher energy tail than the same distribution with the mean temperature @xmath38@xmath39(1-p ) @xmath36 + p @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "contrary to the non - linear imm , the link between the discrete and the continuous time dynamics is straightforward . indeed ,",
    "usual methods of random walk theory @xcite lead to :    @xmath40    the system at time t is thus composed by different classes of particles that are characterised by their mean energy @xmath41 , or equivalently by the number @xmath19 of undergone collisions .",
    "the proportion of particles in these classes is given by the probability for a particle of having performed @xmath19 collisions before time t , namely @xmath20 .",
    "on should note that [ continuoussol ] is a superposition of the initial distribution at different energies , as in [ semidiscretewalk ] and leads to the formation of high energy tails by the same mechanism . assuming that the small k development of the initial characteristic function is @xmath42 , the formal solution [ continuoussol ] reads :    @xmath43    detailed analysis of this solution shows that the inelastic lorentz walk exhibits multiscaling properties , i.e. the dimensionalized velocity moments @xmath44 decay with different cooling rates @xmath45 .",
    "the cooling rates are given by @xmath46 and are decreasing function of i : @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , the system is characterised by an infinite number of independent cooling rates .",
    "moreover , the velocity moments @xmath49 , @xmath50 , grow towards infinity as compared to @xmath51 .",
    "in this paper , we study the formation of the high energy tails observed in inelastic gases . to do so , we focus on the one - dimensional inelastic maxwell model , which is a mean field approximation of the boltzmann equation for inelastic hard rods . by comparing a discrete and a continuous time version of the process",
    ", we show how fluctuations of the number of collisions imply the emergence of high energy tails .",
    "to do so , we perform dsmc simulations of both dynamics , thereby highlighting a new relation between number of _ inelastic _ collisions undergone by a particle and its average energy .",
    "this relation is also analytically studied by focusing on a simpler linear model , i.e. the inelastic lorentz walk .",
    "let us stress that this mechanism is specific to inelastic gases , where energy is dissipated at each collision , and has no counterpart in elastic gases .",
    "a generalisation of this work to higher dimensional systems and to more general kinetic models is under progress ."
