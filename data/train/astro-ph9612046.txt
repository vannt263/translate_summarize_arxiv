    "why study large - scale structure ?",
    "we all want to know what the `` skeleton '' of our universe is , that is , how does the universe look on the largest scales we can investigate ?",
    "it is natural to ask : on what scales does the universe become homogeneous and isotropic , as expected from the cosmological principle ? in addition , we shall see that detailed knowledge of the large - scale structure provides constraints on :    * the formation and evolution of galaxies and larger structures ; * the cosmological model of our universe ( including the mass density of the universe , the nature and amount of the dark matter , and the initial spectrum of fluctuations that gave rise to the structures seen today ) .    what have we learned so far , and what are the main unsolved problems in the field of large - scale structure ?",
    "i discuss these questions in the sections that follow .",
    "i first list some of the unsolved problems .",
    "there are many fundamental problems on which progress is likely to be made in the next decade .",

    "two - dimensional surveys of the universe analyzed with correlation function statistics @xcite reveal structure to scales of at least @xmath2  mpc .",
    "large redshift surveys of the galaxy distribution reveal a considerably more detailed structure of superclusters , voids , and filament network extending to scales of @xmath3@xmath4  mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent and largest redshift survey , the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , is presented in figure  [ fig : one ] ; it reveals the  cellular \" nature of the large - scale galaxy distribution . the upcoming sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , expected to begin operation in 1997 ( see   [ sec:6 ] ) , will provide a three dimensional map of the entire high - latitude northern sky to @xmath5 , with redshifts for approximately @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : two ] presents a simulation of one expected redshift slice from the sdss survey ; the slice represents @xmath7 of the total survey . this survey , and others currently planned , will provide the large increase in the survey volume required to resolve some of the unsolved problems listed above ( see   [ sec:6 ] for details ) .",
    "one of the exciting new developments in the last decade is the ability to compare the large - scale observations with expectations from different cosmologies using state - of - the - art numerical cosmological simulations [ see the contribution by j.  p.  ostriker in these proceedings ] .",
    "standard cosmological models generally succeed in reproducing the overall large - scale structure that we observe . in figure",

    "i leave it up to the viewer to decide which figure displays data and which displays a simulation , and how well they match .",
    "the  good \" news is that a simple cosmological model , starting from a rather uniform distribution of matter after the big - bang , with minute density fluctuations as prescribed by a cdm power spectrum [ see the presentations by j. p. ostriker , p. j. e. peebles , and p. steinhardt ] , can represent the universe we see today reasonably well .",
    "this is a real success for cosmology !",
    "bad \" news is that the quantitative match with the simplest standard models is not very good .",
    "model parameters need to be adjusted , some in an ad - hoc manner , in order to fit the data quantitatively .",
    "i summarize in section [ sec:2.1 ] the ways that individual galaxies reveal the large - scale structure of the universe and describe in section [ sec:2.2 ] the study of large - scale structure using clusters of galaxies .",
    "the correlation function ( of galaxies , of clusters of galaxies , of quasars ) is apowerful statistical measure of the clustering strength on different scales .",
    "the two - point spatial correlation function , @xmath8 , is the net probability above random of finding a pair of objects , each within a given volume element @xmath9 , separated by the distance @xmath10 .",
    "the total probability of finding such a pair is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean density of objects in the sample .",
    "the angular ( projected ) galaxy correlation function was first determined from the 2d lick survey and inverted into a spatial correlation function by groth & peebles @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath13 for @xmath14  mpc , with correlations that drop to the level of the noise for larger scales .",
    "this observation implies that galaxies are clustered on at least @xmath15  mpc scale , with a correlation scale of @xmath16  mpc , where @xmath17 .",
    "more recent results support the above conclusions ( with possibly a weak tail to larger scales in the galaxy correlations ) .",
    "one of the recent determinations of the two - point angular galaxy correlation function , using the apm 2d galaxy survey @xcite , is presented in figure  [ fig : four ] .",
    "the observed correlation function is compared with expectations from the cdm cosmology ( using linear theory estimates ) for different values of the parameter @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the mass density of the universe in terms of the critical density and @xmath20 [ see the contribution of peebles ] .",
    "the different @xmath21 models differ mainly in the large - scale tail of the galaxy correlations : higher values of @xmath21 predict less structure on large scales ( for a given normalization of the initial mass fluctuation spectrum ) since the cdm fluctuation spectrum ( see below ) peaks on scales that are inversely proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : four ] , as was first shown from the analysis of galaxy clusters ( see below ) , that the standard cdm model with @xmath22 and @xmath23 does not produce enough large - scale power to match the observations . as figure  [ fig : four ] shows , the galaxy correlation function requires @xmath240.2 for a cdm - type spectrum , consistent with other large - scale structure data .",
    "the power spectrum , @xmath25 , which reflects the initial spectrum of fluctuations [ see the discussion by p. steinhardt in these proceedings ] that gave rise to galaxies and other structure , is represented by the fourier transform of the correlation function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the recent attempts to determine this fundamental statistic using a variety of tracers is presented in figure  [ fig : five ] ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of this composite spectrum assumes different normalizations for the different tracers used ( optical galaxies , ir galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) .",
    "the different normalizations imply a different bias parameter @xmath26 for each of the different tracers [ where @xmath27 represents the overdensity of the galaxy tracer relative to the mass overdensity ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : five ] also shows the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) anisotropy as measured by cobe @xcite on the largest scales ( @xmath28  mpc ) and compares the data with the mass power spectrum expected for two cdm models : a standard cdm model with @xmath29 ) , and a low - density cdm model with @xmath30 .",
    "the latter model appears to provide the best fit to the data , given the normalizations used by the authors for the different galaxy tracers .",
    "the next decade will provide critical advances in the determination of thecorrelation function and the related power spectrum .",
    "the large redshift surveys now underway (   [ sec:6 ] ) will probe the power spectrum of galaxies to larger scales than currently available and with greater accuracy .",
    "these surveys will bridge the gap between the current optical determinations of @xmath25 of galaxies on scales@xmath31  mpc and the mbr anisotropy on scales @xmath32  mpc .",
    "this bridge will cover the critical range of the spectrum turnover , which reflects the horizon scale at the time of matter - radiation equality .",
    "an example of what may be expected from the sloan survey is shown in figure  [ fig : six ] ; a clear determination of @xmath25 over a wide range of scales is expected in the near future .",
    "this will enable the determination of the initial spectrum of fluctuations at recombination that gave rise to the structure we see today and will shed light on the cosmological model parameters that may be responsible for that spectrum ( such as @xmath21 and the nature of the dark matter ) . in the next decade , @xmath25 will also be determined from the mbr anisotropy measurements on small scales ( @xmath33 to @xmath34 ) [ see p. steinhardt s contribution in these proceedings ] , allowing a most important overlap in the determination of the galaxy @xmath25 from redshift surveys and the mass @xmath25 from the mbr anisotropy .",
    "these data will place constraints on cosmological parameters including @xmath35 , and the nature of the dark matter itself .",
    "the correlation function of clusters of galaxies efficiently quantifies the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "clusters are correlated in space more strongly than are individual galaxies , by an order of magnitude , and their correlation extends to considerably larger scales ( @xmath36  mpc ) .",
    "the cluster correlation strength increases with richness ( @xmath37 luminosity or mass ) of the system from single galaxies to the richest clusters @xcite . here ",
    "richness \" refers to the number of cluster galaxies within a given linear radius of the cluster center and within a given luminosity range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation strength also increases with the mean spatial separation of the clusters @xcite .",
    "this dependence results in a  universal \" dimensionless cluster correlation function ; the cluster dimensionless correlation scale is constant for all clusters when normalized by the mean cluster separation .",
    "empirically , two general relations have been found @xcite for the correlationfunction of clusters of galaxies , @xmath38 : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the amplitude of the cluster correlation function , @xmath42 is the richness of the galaxy clusters of type @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the mean separation of the clusters .",
    "here @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mean spatial number density of clusters of richness @xmath42 in a volume - limited , richness - limited complete sample .",
    "the first relation , equation  ( [ eq : two ] ) , states that the amplitude of the cluster correlation function increases with cluster richness , i.e. , rich clusters are more strongly correlated than poorer clusters .",
    "the second relation , equation  ( [ eq : three ] ) , states that the amplitude of the cluster correlation function depends on the mean separation of clusters ( or , equivalently , on their number density ) ; the rarer , large mean separation richer clusters are more strongly correlated than the more numerous poorer clusters .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : two ] ) and ( [ eq : three ] ) relate to each other through the richness function of clusters , i.e. , the number density of clusters as a function of their richness .",
    "equation ( [ eq : three ] ) describes a universal scale - invariant ( dimensionless ) correlation function with a correlation scale @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 ) .",
    "there are some conflicting statements in the literature about the precise values of the correlation amplitude , @xmath41 .",
    "nearly all these contradictions are caused by not taking account of equation  ( [ eq : two ] ) . when apples are compared to oranges , or the clustering of rich clusters",
    "is compared to the clustering of poorer clusters , differences are expected and observed .    figure  [ fig : seven ] clarifies the observational situation . the @xmath49 relation for groups and clusters of various richnesses",
    "is presented in the figure .",
    "the recent automated cluster surveys of apm @xcite and edcc @xcite are consistent with the predictions of equations  ( [ eq : two ] ) and ( [ eq : three ] ) , as is the correlation function of x - ray selected rosat clusters of galaxies @xcite . bahcall and cen @xcite show that a flux - limited sample of x - ray selected clusters will exhibit a correlation scale that is smaller than that of a volume - limited , richness - limited sample of comparable apparent spatial density since the flux - limited sample contains poor groups nearby and only the richest clusters farther away . using the richness - dependent cluster correlations of equations  ( [ eq : two ] ) and ( [ eq : three ] ) , bahcall and cen @xcite find excellent agreement with the observed flux - limited x - ray cluster correlations of romer et al .",
    "comparison of the observed cluster correlation function with cosmological models strongly constrains the model parameters ( see below ) .",
    "the observed mass function ( mf ) , @xmath50 , of clusters of galaxies , which describes the number density of clusters above a threshold mass @xmath51 , can be used as a critical test of theories of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the richest , most massive clusters are thought to form from rare high peaks in the initial mass - density fluctuations ; poorer clusters and groups form from smaller , more common fluctuations . bahcall and cen @xcite determined the mf of clusters of galaxies using both optical and x - ray observations of clusters .",
    "their mf is presented in figure  [ fig : eight ] .",
    "the function is well fit by the analytic expression @xmath52 with @xmath53 , ( where the mass @xmath51 represents the cluster mass within @xmath54  mpc radius ) .",
    "bahcall and cen @xcite compared the observed mass function and correlationfunction of galaxy clusters with predictions of n - body cosmological simulations of standard @xmath55 and nonstandard @xmath56 cdm models .",
    "they find that none of the standard @xmath22  cdm models , with any normalization , can reproduce both the observed correlation function and the mass function of clusters . a low - density ( @xmath570.3 ) cdm - type model , however , provides a good fit to both sets of observations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : eight][fig : eleven ] ) .",
    "the constraints on @xmath19 are model dependent ; a mixed hot + cold dark matter model , for example , with @xmath22 , is also consistent with the cluster data .    the observed cluster mass function is presented in figure  [ fig : eight ] together with the results of cdm simulations .",
    "the standard cdm model @xmath55 is presented for several bias parameters @xmath26 [ where @xmath26 represents the overdensity of galaxies relative to the mass overdensity ; see   [ sec:2.1 ] ] ; only the unbiased case , @xmath58 , is consistent with the cobe results .",
    "this unbiased model , however , is excluded by the observed mass function : it predicts a much larger number of rich clusters than is observed .",
    "the larger bias model of @xmath59 , while providing a more appropriate mean abundance of rich clusters , is too steep for the observed mass function ; it is also incompatible with the cobe results .    the low - density , low - bias cdm model , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , ( with or without @xmath62 ) is consistent with the observed mass function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eight ] ) .    how does the cdm model agree with the observations of cluster correlations ?",
    "bahcall and cen @xcite used the n - body ( @xmath63 ) simulations to determine the model cluster correlation function as a function of cluster mean separations @xmath64 .",
    "the cdm results for clusters corresponding to the rich abell clusters @xmath65 with @xmath66  mpc are presented in figure  [ fig : nine ] together with the observed correlations @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the standard @xmath22 cdm models are inconsistent with the observations ; they can not provide either the strong amplitude or the large scales ( @xmath67  mpc ) to which the cluster correlations are observed .",
    "similar results are found for the apm and edcc clusters .",
    "the low - density , low - bias model is consistent with the observed cluster correlation function .",
    "it reproduces both the strong amplitude and the large scale to which the cluster correlations are detected .",
    "such a model is the only scale - invariant cdm model that is consistent with both cluster correlations and the cluster mass function .",
    "the dependence of the observed cluster correlation on @xmath64 was tested in the simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ten ] for the low - density model .",
    "the dependence of correlation amplitude on mean separation is clearly seen in the simulations . to compare this result directly with observations , we plot in figure  [ fig : eleven ] the dependence of the correlation scale , @xmath68 , on @xmath64 for both the simulations and the observations .",
    "the low - density model agrees well with the observations , yielding @xmath69 , as observed . the @xmath22 model , while also showing an increase of @xmath68 with @xmath64 , yields considerably smaller correlation scales and a much slower increase of @xmath70 .    what causes the observed dependence on cluster richness [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : two][eq : three ] ) ] ?",
    "the dependence , seen both in the observations and in the simulations , is most likely caused by the statistics of rare peak events , which kaiser @xcite suggested as an explanation of the observed strong increase of correlation amplitude from galaxies to rich clusters .",
    "the correlation function of rare peaks in a gaussian field increases with their selection threshold . since more massive clusters correspond to a higher threshold , implying rarer events and thus larger mean separation , equation  ( [ eq : three ] ) results .",
    "a fractal distribution of galaxies and clusters would also produce equation  ( [ eq : three ] ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how is the mass distributed in the universe ?",
    "does it follow , on the average , the light distribution ? to address this important question , peculiar motions on large scales are studied in order to directly trace the mass distribution .",
    "it is believed that the peculiar motions ( motions relative to a pure hubble expansion ) are caused by the growth of cosmic structures due to gravity [ see the presentations by ostriker , peebles , and steinhardt ] . a comparison of the mass - density distribution , as reconstructed from peculiar velocity data , with the light distribution ( i.e. , galaxies ) provides information on how",
    "well the mass traces light @xcite . the basic underlying relation between peculiar velocity and density",
    "is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mass overdensity , @xmath73 is the galaxy overdensity , and @xmath74 is the bias parameter discussed in   [ sec:2 ] .",
    "a formal analysis yields a measure of the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "other methods that place constraints on @xmath76 include the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution in the redshift direction due to peculiar motions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "measuring peculiar motions is difficult .",
    "the motions are usually inferred with the aid of measured distances to galaxies or clusters that are obtained using some ( moderately - reliable ) distance - indicators ( such as the tully - fisher or @xmath77 relations ) , and the measured galaxy redshift .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath78 is then determined from the difference between the measured redshift velocity , @xmath79 , and the measured hubble velocity , @xmath80 , of the system ( the latter obtained from the distance - indicator ) : @xmath81 .",
    "a comparison between the density distribution of iras galaxies and the mass - density distribution reconstructed from the observed peculiar motions of galaxies in the supergalactic plane is presented in figure  [ fig : twelve ] @xcite .",
    "the distribution of mass and light in this case appear to be similar .",
    "a summary of all measurements of @xmath76 made so far is presented in figure  [ fig : thirteen ] @xcite .",
    "the dispersion in the current measurements of @xmath76 is very large ; the various determinations range from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , implying , for @xmath84 to @xmath83 .",
    "no strong conclusion can therefore be reached at present regarding the values of @xmath76 or @xmath19 .",
    "the larger and more accurate surveys currently underway , including high precision velocity measurements , may lead to the determination of @xmath76 and possibly its decomposition into @xmath19 and @xmath26 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies can also serve as efficient tracers of the large - scale peculiar velocity field in the universe @xcite .",
    "measurements of cluster peculiar velocities are likely to be more accurate than measurements of individual galaxies , since cluster distances can be determined by averaging a large number of cluster members as well as by using different distance indicators . using large - scale cosmological simulations , bahcall et al .",
    "@xcite find that clusters move reasonably fast in all the cosmological models studied , tracing well the underlying matter velocity field on large scales .",
    "the clusters exhibit a maxwellian distribution of peculiar velocities as expected from gaussian initial density fluctuations .",
    "the model cluster 3-d velocity distribution , presented in figure  [ fig : fourteen ] , typically peaks at @xmath85 and extends to high cluster velocities of @xmath86 .",
    "the low - density cdm model exhibits somewhat lower velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourteen ] ) .",
    "approximately 10% of all model rich clusters ( 1% for low - density cdm ) move with @xmath87 .",
    "a comparison of model expectation with the available data of cluster velocities is presented in figure  [ fig : fifteen ] @xcite .",
    "the cluster velocity data are not sufficiently accurate at present to place constraints on the models ; however , improved cluster velocities , expected in the next several years , should help constrain the cosmology .",
    "cen , bahcall and gramann @xcite have recently determined the velocity correlation function of clusters in different cosmologies .",
    "they find that close cluster pairs , with separations @xmath88  mpc , exhibit strong attractive motions ; the pairwise velocities depend sensitively on the model .",
    "the mean pairwise attractive cluster velocities on @xmath89  mpc scale ranges from @xmath90 for @xmath22 cdm to @xmath91 for @xmath92 cdm @xcite .",
    "the cluster velocity correlation function , presented in figure  [ fig : sixteen ] , is negative on small scales  indicating large attractive velocities , and is positive on large scales , to @xmath93  mpc  indicating significant bulk motions in the models .",
    "none of the models reproduce the very large bulk flow of clusters on @xmath94  mpc scale , @xmath95 , recently reported by lauer and postman @xcite .",
    "the bulk flow expected on this large scale is generally @xmath96 for all the models studied ( @xmath22 and @xmath97 cdm , and pbi ; @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies has traditionally been studied with the aid of the observed velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies and the virial theorem ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster potential can also be estimated by the temperature of the hot intracluster gas as determined from x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and by the weak gravitational lens distortion of background galaxies caused by the intervening cluster mass @xcite .",
    "sufficient data are now available from optical observations ( galaxy velocity dispersion in clusters ) , x - ray observations ( the temperature of the intracluster gas ) , and initial estimates from gravitational lensing , so that the results can be intercompared .",
    "the cluster mass determinations are , on the average , consistent with each other @xcite .",
    "the optical and x - ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies yield cluster masses that range from @xmath98 to @xmath99 within @xmath54  mpc radius of the cluster center .",
    "when normalized by the cluster luminosity , a median value of @xmath100 is observed for rich clusters .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio implies a dynamical mass density of @xmath101 on @xmath102 scale .",
    "if , as suggested by theoretical prejudice , the universe has critical density ( @xmath22 ) , then most of the mass in the universe _ can not _ be concentrated in clusters , groups and galaxies ; the mass would have to be distributed more diffusely than the light .    a recent analysis of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , groups and clusters @xcite suggests that while the @xmath103 ratio of galaxies increases with scale up to radii of @xmath104@xmath105  mpc , due to the large dark halos around galaxies ( see fig .",

    "the flattening occurs at @xmath107@xmath108 , corresponding to @xmath57 .",

    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations @xcite suggest that baryons are not preferentially segregated into rich clusters .",
    "it is therefore suggested that either the mean density of the universe is considerably smaller , by a factor of @xmath116 , than the critical density , or that the baryon density of the universe is much larger than predicted by nucleosynthesis .",
    "the observed baryonic mass fraction in rich clusters , when combined with the nucleosynthesis limit , suggests @xmath570.3 ; this estimate is consistent with @xmath101 determined from clusters .",
    "much of the observational evidence from clusters and from large - scale structure suggests that the mass density of the universe is sub - critical : @xmath570.3 (    [ sec:2][sec:4 ] ) .",

    "the sdss will produce a complete photometric and spectroscopic survey of half the northern sky ( @xmath124 steradians ) .",
    "the photometric survey will image the sky in five colors ( @xmath125 ) , using a large array of thirty @xmath126 pixel ccd chips ; the imaging survey will contain nearly @xmath127 galaxies to @xmath128 , a comparable number of stars , and about @xmath6 quasar candidates ( selected on the basis of the five colors ) .",
    "the imaging data will then be used to select the brightest @xmath129 galaxies and @xmath130 quasars for which high - resolution spectra will be obtained ( to @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively ) using 640 fibers on two high - resolution ( @xmath133 ) double - spectrographs .",
    "both the imaging and spectroscopic surveys will be done on the same 2.5-meter wide - field ( @xmath134  fov ) special purpose telescope located at apache point , nm . the imaging survey will also be used to produce a catalog in five colors of all the detected objects and their main characteristic parameters . in the southern hemisphere , the sdss will image repeatedly a long and narrow strip of the sky , @xmath135 , reaching @xmath136 fainter than the large - scale northern survey .",
    "the repeated imaging , in addition to allowing the detection of fainter images , will also be crucial for the detection of variable objects .",
    "figure  [ fig : two ] shows a simulated distribution in redshift space of galaxies expected from the sloan survey in a @xmath137 thick slice along the survey equator .",
    "this figure , based on a cold - dark - matter cosmological model simulation , corresponds to approximately 6% of the galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the redshift histogram of galaxies in the simulated spectroscopic survey peaks at @xmath1380.15 , with a long tail to @xmath139 .    several thousand rich clusters of galaxies will be identified in the survey , many with a large number of measured galaxy redshifts per cluster ( from the complete spectroscopic survey ) .",
    "several hundred large superclusters will also be identified .",
    "this will provide at least a ten - fold increase in the number of clusters and superclusters over presently available samples .    currently under construction ,",
    "the test year for the sdss system will begin observations in 1997 .",
    "more detailed information on the sdss project is provided in @xcite .",
    "large - scale surveys such as the sdss will provide a much needed advance in the systematic study of clusters of galaxies , which is currently limited by the unavailability of modern , accurate , complete , and objectively - selected catalogs of clusters , and by the limited photometric and redshift information for the catalogs that do exist .",
    "the sdss will select clusters algorithmically . from the @xmath6 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample",
    ", we can identify clusters by searching for density enhancements in redshift space .",
    "we can also identify clusters from the much larger photometric sample ( @xmath127 galaxies ) by searching for density enhancements in position - magnitude - color space .",
    "we expect to find approximately 4000 clusters of galaxies with a redshift tail to @xmath140 ; many of the clusters will have a large number of measured galaxy redshifts per cluster ( hundreds of redshifts for nearby clusters ) , and at least one or two redshifts for the more distant clusters .",
    "this complete sample of clusters can be used to investigate numerous topics in the study of clustering and large - scale structure .",
    "i briefly illustrate some of these topics below .",
    "the solutions of the problems outlined below will involve the participation of many graduate students !",
    "clusters are efficient tracers of the large - scale structure .",
    "studies of the cluster distribution have yielded important results even though the number of cluster redshifts in complete samples has been quite small , @xmath141 to 300 .",
    "the sdss will put such studies on a much firmer basis because of the increased sample size ( roughly an order of magnitude more redshifts ) , the objective and automated identification methods , and the use of cluster - finding algorithms that are less subject to projection contamination .",
    "catalogs of nearby superclusters have been constructed using abell clusters with known redshifts , revealing structures on scales as large as @xmath142  mpc @xcite .",
    "there are claims for still larger , @xmath143  mpc structures in the abell cluster distribution @xcite ; these are still controversial @xcite .",
    "the sdss redshift survey will identify a considerably bigger sample of superclusters and will clarify the possible existence of structure on very large scales .",
    "the sizeable cluster sample should also clarify the relation between the cluster distribution and the galaxy distribution .",
    "cluster peculiar velocities , obtained directly from distance indicators such as the @xmath144 measurements and indirectly from the anisotropy of the cluster correlation function in redshift space , will provide information about the internal dynamics of superclusters and the mass distribution on large scales .",
    "the high amplitude of the cluster correlation function , @xmath145 , provided early evidence for strong clustering on large scales (   [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "the complete sample of sdss clusters , objectively defined from uniform and accurate photometric and spectroscopic data , will allow a measurement of @xmath146 free from systematic effects .",
    "we can extend the correlation analysis in several ways , examining in detail the richness dependence of @xmath146 as well as the dependence of the cluster correlation on other cluster properties ( e.g. , velocity dispersion , morphology ) .",
    "the alignment of galaxies with their host clusters , and of clusters with their neighboring clusters , their host superclusters , and other large - scale structures such as sheets and filaments is of great interest .",
    "while the alignment of cd galaxies with their clusters is relatively well established @xcite , alignments at larger scales are still uncertain @xcite .",
    "the sdss will provide a very large sample for alignment studies , including accurate position angles and inclinations .",
    "the existence of large - scale alignments may place interesting constraints on the origin of structure in various cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the complete cluster survey will allow a detailed investigation of intrinsic cluster properties .",
    "from the 2-d and 3-d information , we will be able to determine accurately such properties as cluster richness , morphology , density and density profile , core radius , velocity dispersion profile , optical luminosity , and galaxy content , and to look for correlations between these properties .",
    "the cluster catalogs will be matched with data in other bands , in particular the x - ray .",
    "this will allow a systematic detailed study of global cluster properties and their cross-correlation.measurements of galaxy density , morphology , velocity dispersion , and x - ray emission will shed light on the nature of the intracluster medium and its impact on the member galaxies , and on the relative distribution of baryonic and dark matter .",
    "high surface mass density clusters will be candidates for gravitational lenses ; we can search the photometric data for systematically distorted background galaxies , especially in the deeply - observed southern strip , and target these clusters for yet deeper imaging surveys with larger telescopes .",
    "these lensing studies will allow mapping out the dark matter distribution within the clusters @xcite .",
    "the large statistical sample of clusters will produce new insights into a number of issues associated with structure formation and evolution :    * we will be able to calculate velocity dispersions for @xmath147 clusters with @xmath148 compared to a few dozen clusters with reliable dispersion measurements currently available . for nearer clusters , we will have well - sampled galaxy density profiles and velocity dispersion profiles ; these allow careful cluster mass determinations .",
    "the distributions of cluster masses and velocity dispersions , i.e. , the cluster mass function and velocity function will be determined accurately . * with optical luminosities , galaxy profiles , and velocity dispersion profiles",
    ", we can measure accurate mass - to - light ratios for a large sample of clusters .",
    "combined with x - ray observations of clusters , the baryon fraction can be determined more accurately .",
    "these provide constraints on @xmath19 and the bias parameter of galaxies in clusters . *",
    "the density and dispersion profiles also retain clues about the history of cluster formation .",
    "the frequency of subclustering and non - virial structures in clusters @xcite tells us whether clusters are dynamically old or young . in a gravitational instability model with @xmath22 ,",
    "structure continues to form today , while in a low-@xmath149 , open universe , clustering freezes out at moderate redshift .",
    "cluster profiles and substructure statistics thus provide a diagnostic for @xmath19 , a diagnostic which is independent of the direct measures of the mass density . *",
    "the evolution of the cluster population provides another diagnostic for @xmath19 .",
    "current investigations are limited by the small numbers of known high - redshift clusters , and by the fact that high- and low - redshift clusters areselected in different ways .",
    "the uniform sdss cluster sample will greatly improve the current situation .",
    "the number of clusters will be large ; we will have redshifts for brightest cluster galaxies to @xmath150 by extending the main redshift survey limit @xmath151 fainter for brightest cluster galaxy candidates , and for more distant clusters we can obtain fairly accurate estimated redshifts from the photometry alone ( using the colors and apparent luminosity function of member galaxies ) .",
    "the southern photometric survey will probe the cluster population to redshifts above unity .",
    "peculiar motions of clusters of galaxies can be determined from the sdss survey using distance indicators such as tully - fisher or @xmath152 for cluster galaxies , the cluster luminosity function , or the brightest - cluster - member indicator .",
    "this will allow a determination of the large - scale peculiar motion of clusters to hundreds of mpc .",
    "observations of large - scale structure provide a powerful tool for determining the structure of our universe , for understanding galaxy and structure formation , and for constraining cosmological models .",
    "while extraordinary progress has beenmade over the last decade , many important unsolved problems remain .",
    "the large observational surveys currently underway provide a way of resolving some of these questions [ see also the contribution by p. steinhardt , these proceedings ] .",
    "the interested student has a great opportunity to participate in fundamental discoveries .",
    "what problems can we expect to solve in the next decade ?",
    "i believe that the large redshift surveys of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and quasars will provide a quantitative description of structure on a wide range of scales , from @xmath83 to @xmath153  mpc , including the determinations of the power spectrum , the correlation function , the topology , and other improved statistics (    [ sec:2],[sec:6 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of these statistical measures on galaxy type , luminosity , surface brightness , and system type ( galaxies , clusters , quasars ) will also be determined and used to constrain cosmological models of galaxy formation .",
    "accurate measurements on large scales of the peculiar motions of galaxies and clusters , and the mass distribution on large scales may take longer .",
    "detailed x - ray surveys of galaxy clusters , combined with the large redshift and lensing surveys , will be able to resolve the problem of the baryon fraction in clusters and test suggested explanations (   [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "deep optical and x - ray surveys , using hst , keck , rosat , asca , axaf , sirtf , plus new microwave background studies , and other deep ground - based and space - based observations , should allow a considerable increase in our understanding of the time evolution of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , quasars , and large - scale structure . since the computed evolution of galaxy systems depends strongly on the assumed cosmology and especially on the mass density , with low - density models evolving at much earlier times than high density models , observations of the kind described here will provide some of the most critical clues needed to constrain the cosmological model over the next decade (    [ sec:5],[sec:6 ] ) .    the quantitative description of large - scale structure and its evolution , when compared with state - of - the - art cosmological simulations to be available in the next decade ( e.g. j. p. ostriker , these proceedings ) , will enhance our chances of determining the cosmology of our universe .",
    "will this goal be reached within the next decade ?",
    "we will have to meet again in a decade and see .",
