    "in newtonian gravitational theory , confined to positive masses as active and passive sources , gravitation is an exclusively attractive type of interaction . in general relativity einstein ( 1917 )",
    "showed by introduction of the cosmological constant @xmath0 that gravitation may be repulsive as well ( if @xmath5 ) .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic general - relativistic world models _ including _ the @xmath0-term have been reconsidered in recent years for a variety of reasons .    in the 1990 s a tightly constrained world model including a @xmath0 term ( the so - called bonn - potsdam model ; henceforth bp - model )",
    "was derived by fitting quasar absorption lines ( hoell & priester 1991a , b ; hoell et al .",
    "1994 ; liebscher 1994 ; liebscher et al .",
    "1992a , b ) .",
    "the bp - model was based on the assumption that ly@xmath6-forest quasar absorption lines situated between the ly@xmath6 and ly@xmath7 emission lines reproduce the redshifts of comoving galaxy - populated shells ( called ` bubble walls ' by the authors ) in the universe .",
    "the authors considered as virtues that their model does not require dark matter ( except the @xmath0-fluid ) and has a long age ( @xmath8 years ) providing ample time for galaxy formation . if fixing the matter content by the baryons predicted through big - bang nucleosynthesis , it leads to a large hubble constant @xmath9 .",
    "large values of @xmath9 were claimed in the early days of the hst key project on the distance scale .    during the last few years also other groups went on the ` @xmath0 band waggon ' .",
    "one reason is the apparent need for a nearly flat ( @xmath10 ) universe inferred from cosmic microwave background observations ( lineweaver 1998 , de bernardis et al .",
    "since the @xmath0 term in einstein s field equation is equivalent to the presence of a fluid with an energy density constant in space and time it can be used to fill the universe with ` missing energy ' .",
    "nucleosynthesis constraints limit the amount of baryonic matter far below one in @xmath11 units and peculiar - motion observations suggest that also the attractive dark matter falls short to make the universe flat ( zehavi & dekel 1999 ) .",
    "recently , the repulsive effect of @xmath12 may have been detected more directly .",
    "observations of supernovae of type ia , taken as cosmic ` standard candles ' , appear to require the presence of an accelerating component in the expanding universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .    in view of this added evidence for @xmath0 , one may ask whether the seemingly pioneering q - approach can be reconciled with the new data .",
    "however , since the original bp - model significantly differs from published fits of @xmath0 models to the sn data ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; from now on we use the term ` sn models ' for all models that fit the sn data ) we employ a more general approach , which for our fits is nevertheless based on the same data sets as published bp and sn models . rather than only taking @xmath0 as representing a repulsive component , we allow for fluids which have in common that the equation of state of each fluid yields proportionality between energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 .",
    "this form of the equation of state includes the classical cosmological matter components dust , radiation and the @xmath0 fluid , but also encompasses more general repulsive and attractive components .",
    "we here briefly describe the framework of the multifluid world models , which will be fit to the sn and quasar data .",
    "further details , in particular on their classification , are given in thomas & schulz ( 2001 ) .",
    "we assume the cosmological principle , i.e. homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , leading to the robertson - walker ( rw ) line element .",
    "inserting this into einstein s field equation leads to the friedmann equations @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 is the hubble parameter at time @xmath18 , the vacuum velocity of light is set @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the total energy density of the universe , which we consider as the added contributions of @xmath21 ideal fluid components , each with an energy density @xmath22 .",
    "the energy density of each fluid is correlated to its pressure @xmath23 via an equation of state @xmath24 , for which we assume @xmath25 the constants @xmath26 specify different fluid components .",
    "this simple form encompasses the well known cosmic fluids like ( e.g. kolb & turner 1990 )    * dust ( @xmath27 ) , * radiation and any other extremely relativistic matter ( @xmath28 ) , * the constant - density @xmath0-fluid ( @xmath29 ) , * a network of slow cosmic strings ( @xmath30 ) or * domain walls ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the term `` dust '' should not be confused with the solid - particle component of the interstellar medium as is common in astronomy .",
    "we here follow the practice of relativists to designate non - relativistic ( @xmath32 ) incoherent matter as dust .",
    "in particular , dust includes all baryonic matter and cold dark matter in its simplest form .    apart from dust and radiation the physical background of cosmic fluids with equation of state([eqs ] )",
    "is hardly understood .",
    "therefore , in case of @xmath33 or @xmath34 we use the designation _",

    "we here assume that the corrections for extinction by intervening material , waveband width and shift ( k correction ) as well as peak magnitude via the shape of light - curve have been appropriately applied so that the sne - ia can be utilized as _ relative _ standard candles as discussed in perlmutter et al .",

    "are functions of @xmath57 .",
    "since the absolute peak magnitude of the sne is assumed to be known to a constant , one can compare the observed variation of apparent peak magnitude with @xmath57 with the shape of theoretical distance - module curves given by @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the corrected apparent magnitude and @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "the supernova data set is given in perlmutter et al .",
    "it contains redshift and magnitude data of 42 high redshift sn ( @xmath62 ) and additionally of 18 low redshift sn ( @xmath63 ) which are needed to calibrate the method ( cf .",

    "the evaluation of parameters is not tightly constrained .",
    "the basic idea underlying the q - method is that the ly-@xmath6-forest is caused by intersections of the quasar light with the boundaries of an inhomogeneous bubble structure of the ( baryonic ) matter ( hoell & priester 1991a , b ; hoell et al .",

    "[ snfits ] shows , the sn - method does not allow to decide which equation of state describes the exotic fluid .",
    "a large part of the degeneracy in the exotic component is caused by the relatively low redshifts so far reached by sn observations .",
    "therefore at first glance , the q - method , reaching to comparatively high redshifts close to @xmath96 , appears to be superior to narrow down the exotic component .",
    "caution has to be applied to this suggestive conclusion because the fits of both methods differ significantly .",
    "typically , the sn data lead to closed models with large dust densities @xmath76 ( allowing for cold dark matter ) . despite presence of a repulsive component",

    "only when a flat geometry is required this degeneracy breaks down and the sne ia point towards @xmath0 as dark - energy fluid .",
    "on the other hand , the quasar models usually turn out to be nearly flat , require low dust densities , which exclude substantial amounts of cold dark matter .",
    "they lead to values of the age of the universe of at least 30 gyr ( @xmath9 as above ) .",

    "the q - models expand slowly , as compared to the sn - models , leading to relatively small absorption line differences for given sizes of comoving bubbles . in most sn - models",
    "the same comoving bubbles would produce much larger differences of the lines ( cf .",
    "3 , upper panel ) .",
    "sn models can not fit a slow observed evolution of bubble - wall differences because the development of brightness of the supernovae for @xmath101 with redshift @xmath57 forces a rapid expansion . in the q - models",
    "the supernovae would simply be too dark .",
    "the nearly static phase at @xmath102 strongly contributes to the high ages of the q - models .",
    "we attempted to reconcile the sn world models with a bubble - wall ly@xmath6-forest via assuming various void evolution models . to this end",
    "we replaced the constant void - parameter @xmath67 in the q - method by an ansatz @xmath103 .",
    "however , this approach yielded bad fits with at least ten times larger chisquares than the q - fits .",
    "this result does not appear surprising in view of the fact that a comoving ly@xmath6-forest requires an extended nearly static epoch in the q - fits ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ expfit ] ) . to force agreement with the rapidly expanding sn models can not even be achieved by our double - power - law ansatz .",
    "unless we are invoking complicated multi - parameter models , the q - models and the sn fits with world models composed out of @xmath104 - fluids have been shown to be incompatible .",
    "one possibility would be that robertson - walker models themselves are inadequate approximations to an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "however , this unsolved problem reviewed by krasinski ( 1997 ) is beyond the scope of the present work .    taking for granted the standard view that rw models are fair approximations of the global behavior of the universe we confine the discussion to possible pitfalls inherent to the q - approach or to the sn fitting procedure .",
    "the q - approach rests on at least two assumptions : ( i ) voids and their ` bubble walls ' are stable structures , whose comoving average size is constant from @xmath56 to at least @xmath105 ; ( ii ) the locations of the bubble walls are uniquely determined by the quasar absorption lines selected by the bonn - potsdam group .",
    "\\(i ) during its early linear phase , the size of a small cosmic perturbation will be constant in a comoving frame ( padmanabhan 1993 ) . however , the comoving size of a void will grow nonlinearly when its density contrast exceeds an appreciable fraction of unity ( friedmann & piran 2000 ) .",
    "since current voids have a density contrast of about @xmath106 , they have already reached the nonlinear stage ( el - ad & piran 2000 ) .",
    "insofar it appears to be a critical point that the q - method has not yet been applied _ together _ with a self - consistent model of void evolution .",

    "is claimed by statistical studies . backed by numerical simulations of structure formation ,",

    "these simulations utilize appreciable amounts of dark matter , which is at variance with the low - density baryonic q - models . at low redshift",
    ", there appears to be a trend that the ly@xmath6 absorbers trace the large - scale distribution of galaxies ( although absorption systems _ within _ voids were also found ) .",
    "however , the q - approach , as proposed by the bp group , assumes that coincidence of galaxy sheets and absorber sheets has persisted since epochs at large redshifts .",
    "this contrasts with current belief of strong evolution at relatively low redshift .",

    "we have compared the methods to derive world models from a kind of luminosity distance - redshift relation given by sne ia observations ( the sn approach ) and , on the other hand , from ly@xmath6-forest lines when one assumes that these arise in galaxy - populated walls and filaments around cosmic voids ( the q - approach ) . while the original authors essentially focused on world models with @xmath0 plus normal incoherent matter ( and radiation , which , however , only plays a role at dense stages of the universe , e.g. near a big bang ) we allowed for a more general class of cosmic fluids only restricted by an equation of state @xmath104 .",

    "<S> recently perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) suggested a positive value of einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0 on the basis of luminosity distances from type - ia supernovae ( the `` sn - method '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath0 world models had earlier been proposed by hoell & priester ( 1991 ) and liebscher et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1992a , b ) on the basis of quasar absorption - line data ( the `` q - method '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> employing more general repulsive fluids ( `` dark energy '' ) encompassing the @xmath0 component we quantitatively compare both approaches with each other .    </S>",
    "<S> fitting the sn - data by a minimum - component model consisting of dark energy + dust ( pressureless matter ) yields a closed universe with a large amount of dust exceeding the baryonic content constrained by big - bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the dark energy is hardly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> only when enforcing a flat universe there is a clear tendency to a dark - energy @xmath0 fluid and the ` canonical ' value @xmath1 for dust .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely , a minimum - component q - method fit yields a sharply defined , slightly closed model with a low dust density ruling out significant pressureless dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the dark - energy component obtains an equation - of - state @xmath2 close to that of a @xmath0-fluid ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 or a precisely flat spatial geometry are inconsistent with minimum - component models .    </S>",
    "<S> it is found that quasar and supernova data sets can not be reconciled with each other via ( repulsive ideal fluid+incoherent matter+radiation)-world models . </S>",
    "<S> compatibility could be reached by drastic expansion of the parameter space with at least two exotic fluids added to dust and radiation as world constituents . </S>",
    "<S> if considering such solutions as far - fetched one has to conclude that the q - method and the sn - ia constraints are incompatible . </S>"
