    "the intensity - dependent refractive index due to odd - order optical nonlinearities is a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear optics .",
    "accurate knowledge of it is important for most applications of intense laser pulses . in condensed matter ,",
    "the z scan technique , a measurement of self - focusing @xcite , is widely employed , but in gases , it is difficult to use because the interaction length can not be easily characterized .",
    "experiments that measure the phase shift induced by a pump pulse on itself in an extended medium [ 2 - 5 ] also require careful consideration of propagation effects and plasma defocusing at high intensity @xcite .",
    "accounting for these phenomena quantitatively requires extensive theoretical modeling . for this reason ,",
    "pump - probe experiments , which measure the effect of cross phase modulation , have an important advantage . for a weak probe one",
    "can at least be certain that the response of the medium is linear in the probe field , and interpretation of the experimental result appears relatively straightforward . however , in such an experiment , a pump - probe interference grating",
    "_ always _ appears in the medium and pump light is diffracted by this grating into the probe beam direction .",
    "one must properly account for the contribution of this to the probe phase shift .    depending on the relative phase between the diffracted pump beam light and the probe beam ,",
    "the probe can experience a phase shift and/or an amplitude change @xcite .",
    "this is the physical mechanism responsible for the enhanced phase shift in cross phase modulation compared to self - phase modulation .",
    "the amplitude effect is often referred to as _ two - beam coupling _ @xcite . for an instantaneous optical kerr nonlinearity",
    ", one finds that the probe picks up twice the nonlinear phase shift of the pump , but there is no net energy transfer . in general the result",
    "depends on the details of the nonlinearity , such as the response time , and even the details of the pulse shape , such as whether or not it is chirped .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive discussion of the _ phase shift _ imparted on the probe pulse and the underlying physics .",
    "we approach this topic in the context of a debate over the higher - order kerr effect , ignited by a recent degenerate pump - probe experiment in ar , n@xmath0 , and o@xmath0 reported by loriot _",
    "et al . _",
    "a negative birefringence was observed at high pump intensity when the pump and probe pulses overlapped in time .",
    "it was concluded that the expansion of the nonlinear refractive index in powers of the optical intensity @xmath1 , @xmath2 , is dominated by higher - order negative terms at high intensity .",
    "initially , the enhancement of the phase shift in cross phase modulation was not considered , and the kerr coefficients for the effect of a pulse on itself were corrected in an erratum @xcite . however , this correction accounts only for the nearly instantaneous bound electronic component of the nonlinearity .",
    "an alternative explanation for the negative birefringence observed at high intensity by loriot _",
    "et al_.  @xcite can be found by considering the diffraction effects caused by the plasma grating generated when the pump intensity is high enough to significantly ionize the gas @xcite .",
    "recently an experiment in air using 400 nm pulses @xcite found that the intensity dependence of the negative birefringence was consistent with a calculation of the plasma grating - induced birefringence based on multiphoton ionization @xcite .    here",
    ", we generalize the theory to allow the use of any ionization model , account for grating effects from the molecular alignment component of the nonlinearity , and extend the theory to handle pulses of arbitrary frequency and chirp .",
    "we also present new experimental results from degenerate pump - probe experiments demonstrating the probe phase shift originating from plasma grating diffraction effects .",
    "we note that many recent experiments have used a nondegenerate probe @xcite , for which there is no plasma or rotational grating contribution to the nonlinear phase shift @xcite , as detailed below .",
    "we first describe a theoretical framework for the calculation of the outgoing probe field in a general pump - probe experiment .",
    "we then numerically calculate the signal and compare the calculations to the loriot _",
    "et al . _",
    "experiment @xcite , and to nondegenerate spectral interferometry measurements @xcite .",
    "finally , we present new experimental results using spectrally - resolved transient birefringence and spectral interferometry with a degenerate probe pulse .",
    "initially reported , as far as we are aware , by chiao , kelley , and garmire @xcite , the grating - induced probe phase shift ( `` weak wave retardation '' ) is related to `` self - diffraction '' effects that have been often encountered in experiments in condensed matter ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "two - beam coupling , which typically refers to energy exchange between the pump and probe beams , has been studied in depth @xcite .",
