    "clusters of galaxies , by virtue of being the largest known virialized objects , are important probes of large scale structure and can be used to test cosmological models .",
    "rich clusters are extremely massive , @xmath1@xmath2 , as indicated by the presence of strongly gravitationally lensed background galaxies and by the deep gravitational potential necessary to explain both the large velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 1000 km s@xmath4 ) in the member galaxies and the high measured temperature ( @xmath5 kev ) of the ionized intracluster gas .",
    "dynamical mechanisms for segregating baryonic matter from dark matter on these mass scales are difficult to reconcile with observations and standard cosmological models , and so within the virial radius the mass composition of clusters is expected to reflect the universal mass composition . under the fair sample hypothesis , a cluster s gas mass fraction , which is a lower limit to the its baryonic mass fraction , is then a lower limit to the universal baryon fraction , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the luminous baryonic content of galaxy clusters is mainly contained in the gaseous intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the gas mass is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the mass in optically observed galaxies ( , white  1993 , forman & jones 1982 ) .",
    "hence , the gas mass is not only a lower limit to the cluster s baryonic mass , it is a reasonable estimate of it .",
    "the intracluster medium has largely been studied through observations of its x - ray emission .",
    "the icm is hot , with electron temperatures , @xmath7 , from @xmath15 to 15 kev ; rarefied , with peak electron number densities of @xmath8 @xmath9 ; and cools slowly ( @xmath10 ) , mainly via thermal bremsstrahlung in the x - ray band .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is proportional to the emission measure , @xmath11 , where the integration is along the line of sight , and so , under simplifying assumptions , the gas mass can be calculated from an x - ray image deprojection and the measured gas temperature .",
    "since the sound crossing time of the cluster gas is much less than the dynamical time , one may reasonably assume that , in the absence of a recent merger , the cluster gas is relaxed in the cluster s potential .",
    "the total binding mass can be extracted from the gas density and temperature distribution under this assumption .",
    "a significant body of work exists in which the gas mass fraction , @xmath12 , is measured in this way , with @xmath12 measurements out to radii of 1 mpc or more ( white & fabian 1995 ; david  1995 ; neumann & bohringer , 1997 ; squires  1997 ; mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "the mean cluster gas mass fraction within approximately the virial radius was calculated in mohr ( 1999 ) to be ( 0.0749 @xmath13 . here , and throughout the paper , we assume the value of the hubble constant to be @xmath14 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .    to derive the gas mass fraction from x - ray imaging data , one is required to deproject the surface brightness into a model for the density distribution .",
    "as the x - ray emission is proportional to the square of the gas density , the gas mass measurement can be biased by clumped , multi - phase gas , should it be present .",
    "also , the emission from the cores of relaxed clusters may be dominated by cooling flows , which complicate the interpretation of the x - ray data and may bias the result strongly if not taken into account ( allen 1998 ; mohr  1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray surface brightness is diminished in proportion to its distance ; @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the redshift of the cluster , neglecting experiment - specific k - corrections , and so it becomes increasingly difficult to make sensitive x - ray measurements of the icm as the cluster redshift increases .",
    "we present a scheme for measuring the gas mass fractions with the sunyaev - zeldovich effect which is different from the x - ray method in a number of ways , and also provides an independent measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect is a spectral distortion of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation due to scattering of cmb photons by hot plasma ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "the sz effect can be detected significantly in galaxy clusters , where the ionized intracluster gas serves as the scattering medium .",
    "a small fraction , @xmath17 , of cmb photons are inverse - compton scattered and , on average , gain energy . at frequencies less than about 218 ghz",
    ", the intensity of the cmb radiation is diminished as compared to the unscattered cmb , and the sz effect is manifested as a brightness temperature decrement towards the cluster .",
    "this decrement , @xmath18 , has a magnitude proportional to the total number of scatterers , weighted by their associated temperature , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number density of electrons , @xmath7 is the electron temperature , @xmath21 is the temperature of the cmb , and the integration is again along the line of sight . note that this is simply proportional to the integrated electron pressure .",
    "also , the magnitude of the sz decrement is independent of redshift , so as the long as the cluster is resolved ( the experiment s characteristic beamsize is not larger than the angle subtended by the cluster ) , the sz effect can be measured towards arbitrarily distant clusters .",
    "a cluster s gas mass is directly proportional to its integrated sz effect if the gas is isothermal .",
    "so under the isothermality condition , an image deprojection is not strictly required to obtain the gas mass .",
    "the cluster s gas mass fraction can be calculated by comparing the integrated sz decrement , in effect a surface gas mass , to the total cluster mass in the same volume .",
    "the total mass can be measured with strong or weak gravitational lensing , for example .",
    "the sz images may also be deprojected to infer the three - dimensional gas mass and the hse mass .",
    "since the sz decrement is directly propotional to the electron density , the sz image deprojection will not be affected strongly by clumped gas .",
    "thus , the cluster s gas mass fraction can then be measured as a function of cluster radius as well .",
    "recent cluster gas mass fraction measurements from sz effect observations are presented in myers  ( 1997 ) . in this work",
    ", the integrated sz effect is measured using a single radio dish operating at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "the integrated sz effect is used to normalize a model for the gas density from published x - ray analyses , and this gas mass is compared to the published total masses to determine the gas mass fraction .",
    "for three nearby clusters , a2142 , a2256 and the coma cluster , myers  find a gas mass fraction of @xmath22 at radii of 1 - 1.5 @xmath23 mpc ; for the cluster abell 478 , they report a gas mass fraction of @xmath24 .    in this work ,",
    "we describe a method to calculate cluster gas mass fractions from interferometric sz observations . here , the shape parameters are derived directly from the sz dataset rather than from an x - ray image .",
    "we apply this method to the sz effect measurements towards the cluster abell 370 , which were made as part of an sz survey of distant clusters , the first results of which were reported in carlstrom , joy & grego ( 1996 ) , and are further reported in carlstrom  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we choose this primarily because it has been studied at optical and x - ray wavelengths , and so allows a comparison of the sz data with other observations . upon detailed investigation ,",
    "it is apparent that this cluster is one of the most difficult in our sample to analyze , with significant ellipticity and complicated optical and x - ray structure ; as such , it serves as a test of the gas mass fraction analysis method , which we plan to use on a large sample of clusters .    with the interferometric sz measurements , complemented by observations at other wavelengths , we measure the cluster s gas mass fraction in two ways",
    "first , we calculate the surface gas mass from the sz measurements and the surface total mass from strong gravitational lensing observations and models .",
    "second , we measure the gas mass fraction in a manner similar to x - ray analyses . the gas mass is inferred from a deprojected model ; the total mass is determined from the spatial distribution of the gas under the isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) assumption .",
    "we test the assumptions made in the hse analysis by comparing the total cluster masses derived in the two methods .",
    "the optical and x - ray observations of this cluster are discussed in section  [ sec : optxray ] , and the sz observations are discussed in section  [ sec : szobs ] .",
    "the method for modeling the sz data is presented in section  [ sec : model ] , and the gas mass fraction results and the systematic uncertainties are discussed in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the cosmological implications of the results and plans for future work are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the spatial distribution and redshifts of a number of abell 370 s constituent galaxies have been measured optically .",
    "mellier  ( 1988 ) , using their 29 best galaxy spectra , find abell 370 has a mean redshift z = 0.374 and velocity dispersion @xmath25 .",
    "these observations also show that the cluster is dominated by two giant elliptical galaxies , at ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , with a projected separation of about @xmath30 in the north - south direction .",
    "the major axes of these two dominant galaxies are also oriented nearly north  south .",
    "the mellier  optical isopleth map shows two density peaks , with similar north - south orientation , although these are not centered on the two elliptical galaxies .",
    "the 29 galaxy velocities do not appear to be distributed in a gaussian manner , although the statistics on this modest sample are not conclusive .",
    "should this be significant , its may suggest that the cluster is bimodal or that it is not yet fully relaxed , and the assumption of a simple one - component model in hydrostatic equilibrium would not be appropriate .",
    "the mean velocities in the two isopleth peaks are not found to differ significantly , however , nor are the calculated barycenters of the two peaks , and so it is difficult to make a firm conclusion on the state of the cluster based on these data alone .",
    "abell 370 was the first cluster found to have an associated strongly gravitationally lensed arc @xmath31 ; soucail  1988 ) .",
    "in addition to this giant arc , which apparently consists of multiple images of a single source , three faint pairs of images , each pair presumed to be lensed images of a single galaxy ( kneib  1993 ) , and a radial arc ( smail  1996 ) have been found to be associated with this cluster .",
    "gravitational lens models have been used to map the total mass distribution in the core region of abell 370 .",
    "kneib  ( 1993 ) find the position and elongation of the giant arc and the positions of the multiple images are best reproduced by a bimodal distribution of matter , with the two centers of mass nearly coincident with the cluster s two large elliptical galaxies .",
    "a subsequently discovered radial arc is consistent with this model without modifications ( smail  1996 ) .",
    "abell 370 was observed with the high resolution imager ( hri ) of the _ rosat _ x - ray satellite . in the _ rosat _",
    "bandpass ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , x - ray bremsstrahlung emission from a plasma at gas temperatures typical of clusters depends only weakly on the gas temperature . in figure 1",
    ", we show an hri image of a370 , the result of @xmath1 30 kiloseconds of observation time .",
    "the bright source to the north , at @xmath32 , @xmath33 , is coincident with what appears in the digital sky survey to be a nearby elliptical galaxy , npm1 g -01.0096 ( klemola , jones & hanson 1987 ) , and does not appear to be associated with a370 .",
    "the image indicates that the intra - cluster medium also is elongated in the north - south direction , and the emission is strongly peaked at the position of the southern dominant elliptical galaxy , numbered 35 in mellier  ( 1988 ) , and is offset from the center of the large scale emission .",
    "the cluster gas distribution does not appear clearly bimodal at this resolution .",
    "we determine the x - ray surface brightness from the rosat hri image , which has been filtered to include only pha channels 1 - 7 in order to reduce the background level ( david  1997 ) and blocked into 8@xmath34 8@xmath35 pixels .",
    "a circular region with a radius of 24@xmath35 centered on the pointlike x - ray source to the north of the cluster was excluded from our modeling .",
    "we fit a -model to the data ; this model described in more detail in section  [ sec : model ] , which parametrizes the x - ray surface brightness with a core radius , , and a power law index , .",
    "the surface brightness of a spheroidally symmetric , isothermal gas distribution will have elliptical contours , and so we also fit for the axis ratio .",
    "we find the best - fit axis ratio of the x - ray image to be 0.73@xmath36 , with major axis exactly north - south , and the center position to be @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the best fitting shape parameters for the elliptical model are = 0.70@xmath39 and = 85.0@xmath40 .",
    "if the axis ratio is set to equal 1.0 , the best fitting shape parameters are = 0.72@xmath39 , = @xmath41 ( 90% confidence on a single parameter ) .",
    "abell 370 was also observed with the _ einstein _",
    "ipc for 4000 seconds . in the ipc image ,",
    "the northern point source is not apparent .",
    "this may be because the fwhm of the instrument point spread function is about 90@xmath35 at the middle of the 0.4 - 4.0 kev spectral range of the instrument .",
    "( it improves to about 60@xmath35 at higher energies . )",
    "the point source is offset by less than 120@xmath35 from the center of the extended emission , and so may not be resolved in this image .",
    "it may also be explained by source variation ; if the point source is an agn , its surface brightness may have significantly varied between the 1979 ipc observation and the 1994 - 1995 hri observations .",
    "the image looks less elliptical than does the hri image , but because the point source emission can not be excluded from the cluster emission in the ipc data , it is not useful for constraining the spatial distribution of the cluster gas .",
    "abell 370 has also been observed with the asca x - ray satellite . using 37.5 kiloseconds of _ asca _ gis / sis observations , mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) determined the emission - weighted average temperature of the cluster to be @xmath42 kev . analyzing the same data , ota , mitsuda , & fukazawa ( 1998 )",
    "find the emission - weighted temperature to be @xmath43 kev .",
    "both of these values are systematically lower than the value obtained in the first analysis of these data by bautz ( 1994 ) , who obtain a value of @xmath44 kev .",
    "the discrepancy is presumably because the mushotzky  and ota  analyses used the values of the response matrices of the _ asca _ telescope and x - ray detectors which have been refined since the bautz  analysis ( m. bautz , private communication ) . for our analysis",
    ", we adopt the ota  value of @xmath43 kev , because this published analysis includes detailed discussion of the spectral fitting procedure .",
    "the bright point source evident in the _ rosat _ hri image has not been removed from the _ asca _ spectra in any of the three published analyses .",
    "if this emission originates in bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas in the elliptical galaxy , its characteristic temperature is expected to be less than 1 or 2 kev ( sarazin & white 1988 and references therein ) . since the sensitivity of _ asca _ is optimized for higher energies than this",
    ", we would not expect the measured temperature to be greatly contaminated .",
    "we assess whether the source is extended , and find that it is pointlike at the resolution of the hri with a 2.4 @xmath45 certainty . as",
    "the source is unresolved , this emission is also consistent with a galactic cooling flow ; if this were the case , the temperature again should nt be greatly contaminated .",
    "should the emission originate from an agn in the galaxy , though , the effect on the measured temperature is more difficult to predict , and will depend strongly on the index of the power law of the agn spectrum .    without further measurements , we can not rule out that the cluster s spectrum is contaminated by emission from an agn .",
    "it is also possible that if the cluster is in fact bimodal with two distinct subclusters , the measured emission - weighted average @xmath7 will be a value between the temperatures of the two subclusters .",
    "lacking more definitive measurements , we continue with our assumption that the gas is isothermal at @xmath46 kev .",
    "the estimated effects of the described uncertainties on the results are discussed in section  [ subsec : systematics ] .",
    "we compare a370 s measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion with our adopted gas temperature , and find @xmath47 .",
    "if the energy per unit mass contained in the galaxies is equal to that in the gas , and the cluster is spherical , we expect @xmath48 to be @xmath49 .",
    "if the temperature measurement is biased low , , from an agn , this will contribute to the @xmath48 discrepancy .",
    "elongation of the cluster potential along the line of sight or a alignment of two ( or more ) subclusters will also enhance the measured @xmath48 .",
    "the optical and x - ray observations suggest that a370 is not a relaxed cluster , and may be heavily substructured , but due to insufficient signal - to - noise ratios and contaminating sources , these observations still leave some ambiguity .",
    "we observed abell 370 for 50 hours over nine days with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array in 1996 august and 43 hours over six days with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter observatory in 1997 june - august .",
    "we set our pointing center to @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 , the position of the northern dominant elliptical galaxy .",
    "we outfitted the millimeter telescopes with centimeter - wavelength receivers to broaden the instrument s angular resolution to the large angular scales typical of clusters .",
    "the receivers are based on low noise high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers ( see pospieszalski 1995 ) , operating from 26 to 36 ghz .",
    "the single - mode receivers are constructed to respond only to circularly polarized light .",
    "the receivers interface with each array s delay lines and correlator .",
    "the standard observational scheme entailed interleaving 20 minute cluster observations with observations of a strong reference source near the cluster , which allows monitoring of the instrumental amplitude and phase gain .",
    "the amplitude gain drifts were minimal ; the gain changes were less than a percent over a many hour track , and the average gains were quite stable from day to day .",
    "the amplitude gains were calibrated by comparing the measured flux of mars with that predicted by the rudy model for mars whole disk brightness temperature ( rudy , 1987 ) at the observed frequency and the apparent size of mars as indicated by the astronomical almanac .",
    "the rudy model is a radiative transfer model with an estimated accuracy of 4% ( 90% confidence ) at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "data taken when the projected baseline was within 3% of the shadowing limit were not used .",
    "the ovro millimeter array consists of six 10.4 meter telescopes .",
    "the ovro continuum correlator was used to correlate two 1 ghz bands centered at 28.5 ghz and 30 ghz .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 40 - 60 k , depending on elevation and atmospheric water content .",
    "the primary beams of the telescopes were measured holographically and can be approximated as gaussian with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 252@xmath35 .",
    "the data were calibrated and edited using the mma data reduction package ( scoville  1993 ) taking care to remove data taken during poor weather or which show any anomalous phase jumps .",
    "we image the data using the difmap package ( shepard , pearson , & taylor 1994 ) . examining images of a370 made with projected baselines greater than 2.0 @xmath53",
    ", we find a point source 45@xmath35 to the east of the map center ( map center is the pointing center ) in both continuum bands .",
    "its measured flux density in the 28.5 ghz band , attenuated by the instrumental primary beam pattern , is + 0.69 @xmath54 0.10 mjy and is + 0.84 @xmath54 0.10 mjy in the 30 ghz band .",
    "this source , 0237 - 0147 , is discussed further in cooray  1998 .",
    "we combine the two continuum channels , and find the best fitting model is a point source with flux density of @xmath55 mjy .",
    "the point source model is removed from the or spatial frequency , data set in order to construct the sz decrement map .",
    "a gaussian taper with fwhm of 1.2 @xmath56 is applied in the  plane to the combined dataset and map was cleaned , restricting the clean components to the central 200@xmath35 , about the size of the decrement in the primary .",
    "the map presented in figure 2a is made with a restoring beam of gaussian fwhm @xmath57 x @xmath58 , with contour intervals of 1.5 @xmath45 . the @xmath59 noise in the map is 50 @xmath60 jy beam@xmath4 , or 14.9 @xmath60k , and the integrated flux density of the source is @xmath61 mjy .",
    "we employed nine of the 6.1 meter telescopes of the bima array for sz observations , using the same centimeter - wave receivers we used at ovro .",
    "we center the 800 mhz bandwidth of the bima digital correlator at 28.5 ghz .",
    "we achieved system temperatures of 30 - 55 k , scaled to above the atmosphere , depending on elevation and atmospheric water content .",
    "holographic antenna pattern measurements were also made with this system .",
    "the primary beam at bima is nearly gaussian with a @xmath62 fwhm .",
    "the data were edited and reduced using the miriad data reduction program ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) , taking care to the remove any spurious interference from the spectral channels and dropping the low signal - to - noise channels at the spectral filter edges .    again using difmap",
    ", we find the same point source at about @xmath63 to the east of the pointing center in a high resolution ( projected baselines longer than @xmath64 ) image .",
    "the point source measured at bima in 1997 has flux density of + 0.70 @xmath54 0.17 mjy .",
    "the primary beam attenuation at the point source position in the bima system is @xmath65 less than the attenuation at this position at ovro , and so the point source observations are consistent with the flux being constant in time .",
    "we model and subtract the point source from the data set , apply a gaussian taper with fwhm of 0.8 @xmath56 in the  plane and construct a map of the decrement .",
    "the map was cleaned , restricting the clean components to the central @xmath66 of the image , about the size of the primary beam .",
    "the restoring beam used to make the map in figure 2b .",
    "is a gaussian with fwhm @xmath67 x @xmath68 , and the contours presented are at intervals of 1.5 @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath59 noise in the map is 180 @xmath60jy beam@xmath4 , or 31.4 @xmath60k , and the integrated flux density of the source is @xmath69 mjy .",
    "it is instructive to compare the general characteristics of the sz images to the x - ray map . at the resolution of both the ovro and bima instruments ,",
    "the gas is extended in the north - south direction , though less markedly than in the x - ray map .",
    "the substructure suggested by the lensing and velocity dispersion data is not evident here .",
    "we produce maps from each of the datasets , increasing the image resolution , but the gas still does not show significant substructure or bimodality .",
    "the sz decrement distribution is not peaked at the pointing center , but south of it , at a position about halfway between the two elliptical galaxies ( this will be quantified in the next section ) .",
    "the detailed appearance of the sz map , especially the shapes of the least significant contours , depends on the specific method of point source removal and the cleaning of the data , and so it is not useful to compare the spatially filtered and cleaned sz and x - ray images at such a level of detail . as we will discuss in the following section",
    ", the quantitative analysis of the sz data is done using the  data directly .",
    "in order to assess the data more quantitatively , we fit a parametrized model to the sz brightness distribution . since the sz data are taken in the spatial frequency , or , domain , we do the model comparisons in  domain as well .",
    "we measure the sz temperature decrement in units of antenna temperature , @xmath70 , which relates an observed intensity change to a rayleigh - jeans temperature change , @xmath71 . in order to recover the true blackbody temperature decrement , the @xmath72 measured and reported here",

    "we fit a simple model to the sz data .",
    "the -model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 , 1978 ) is frequently used to fit the density profiles of galaxy clusters .",
    "the spherically symmetric , isothermal -model describes @xmath20 , the density distribution of the gas , as varying as a function of cluster radius , @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number density of the gas at the center of the spheroidally symmetric gas distribution ; @xmath90 , the core radius , is a characteristic size of the cluster ; and @xmath91 is the power law index .",
    "since the cluster appears elliptical in projection , we generalize the spherically - symmetric -model and allow the gas density profile to be spheroidally symmetric , , with biaxial symmetry . in the spheroidally symmetric model , the electron number density in a prolate spheroid is a function of @xmath92 , where @xmath87 and @xmath16 are the radial and height coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system , and @xmath93 is the axis ratio of the two unique axes . if the spheroid is oblate , then the density is a function of @xmath94 , with @xmath93 .",
    "the electron density then follows the distribution : @xmath95 if the cluster gas is isothermal and its symmetry axis is in the plane of the sky , this electron density distribution leads to the following two - dimensional sz temperature decrement : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the angular diameter distance , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the temperature decrement at zero projected radius , @xmath101 where the integral , @xmath79 is along the line of sight .",
    "formally , this integral extends from the observer along the line of sight through the cluster infinitely ; in practice , a cutoff radius for the cluster is used .",

    "since the bimodal model doubles the parameter space over which fits must be made , making a comprehensive parameter fit unfeasable , we approximate the statistical uncertainty from the fit to be the same as in the single model fit , about 20% .    these surface gas masses are compared to the cluster s total mass in the same volume implied by the strong gravitational lensing measurements . the surface total mass can be inferred from a model of the cluster mass distribution which predicts the observed gravitational lensing .",
    "we calculate the gravitational mass using the lensing model in kneib   ( 1993 ) for the same volume , centered at the sz model fit center .",
    "although the uncertainties on the model parameters are less than ten percent , we make a conservative estimate of 20% for the uncertainty , to allow for variations of this model .",
    "comparing this mass , @xmath129 , to the single - component gas mass yields a gas mass fraction , @xmath12 , of @xmath130 ; the two - component model yields a slightly lower gas mass fraction of @xmath131 .",
    "the cluster s angular diameter distance was calculated assuming  = 0.3 and  = 0 .",

    "since strong gravitational lensing in clusters is relatively rare and is restricted to the cores of clusters , and weak lensing analyses are published for only selected clusters , we also consider the more general means of calculating the cluster gas fraction , deprojection of the density model and the hse assumption .",
    "we assume the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , is isothermal , and is spheroidally symmetric ; for simplicity , we assume the symmetry axis is in the plane of the sky .",
    "the surfaces of constant electron density are then concentric ellipsoids .",

    ", we again assume the gas has the solar metallicity of anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) and that @xmath60 is constant throughout the gas . making the assumption that the gas is isothermal ,",
    "we write equation  [ eq : rho_grav1 ] in the form :    @xmath143    note that the gravitational mass density depends only on the shape of the gas distribution , and so is independent of the value of the central gas density and the gas mass fraction . using the derived shape parameters , , , and",
    "projected axis ratio , @xmath144 , and the measured gas temperature , we estimate the total mass density of the cluster .",
    "we again choose the simplest geometries , that of oblate and prolate ellipsoids , and integrate the density within the same volume as we do the gas density .",

    "we prefer to measure the masses and mass fractions in the largest volume permitted by our method , since the fair sample assumption is best at large radii and the cores of clusters may be affected significantly by physical processes not included in our hse model ( cooling flows , galaxy winds , magnetic fields ) .",

    "we also calculate the gas mass fraction for both components of the bimodal model , using a gas temperature of 6.6 kev for each and find that the gas mass fraction for each component is @xmath151 .",
    "the dark matter needed to produce concentrically ellipsoidal isopotential surfaces has a significantly more aspherical distribution than the potential . for the observed axis ratio of 0.64 , this dark matter distribution is unphysical beyond a few core radii in the direction of the unique axis , as it requires the dark matter density to be negative .",
    "this also implies that the gas mass fraction will vary spatially .",
    "the difficulty of this model supporting very elliptical gas density distributions may be suggesting that the cluster is bimodal , but it is more likely an indictment of the simplified models we have used .",
    "we have considered the class of potentials with isopotential surfaces following concentric ellipsoids because they adequately describe the data and because their deprojections are straightforward .",

    ", the cluster mass must be partially comprised of dark matter with negative density .",
    "it is improper , then , to measure the dark matter with this method out past a few core radii for a highly elliptical cluster .",
    "the effect of using this simple ellipsoidal model to calculate @xmath12 is assessed in the following way .",
    "we construct a model cluster which has a physically motivated mass structure , predict its observed sz effect , and then attempt to recover the simulated cluster s mass using the same observation and analysis protocol used for the true observations .",
    "we arrange the dark matter of the simulated cluster in concentrically spheroidal shells with a -model profile .",
    "the dark matter s axis ratio is set to 2.0:3.5 . isothermal gas at 7 kev is added in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster potential , and a simulated two - dimensional sz decrement map constructed , assuming the cluster is at redshift @xmath16 = 0.37 .",
    "the decrement map is sampled with the  coverage of a typical interferometric observation .",
    "noise typical of a @xmath1 40 hour observation is added .",

    "two simulations are used , one model cluster is an oblate spheroid and the other a prolate spheroid , both with the symmetry axis in the plane of the sky . in both cases ,",
    "the best fit axis ratio of the gas distribution was 0.79 .",
    "these gas masses and gas mass fractions are compared to the actual model values .",
    "these are shown in table 2 .",
    "the model appears to be adequate at small radii , but deteriorates noticeably by a radius of 100@xmath35 .",
    "this suggests it is reasonable to measure the gas mass fraction with this model near the same radius we constrain the data well .",
    "we restrict our analysis of the real observations to within radius of @xmath153 330@xmath23 kpc ) , a region within which the approximation is valid .        if the assumptions made in the hydrostatic isothermal analysis are valid , the hse predicted mass should equal the cluster s lensing mass .",
    "we integrate the total mass density in equation  [ eq : rho_grav2 ] in the same cylindrical volume in which the lensing mass is calculated .",
    "this comparison is potentially a means to discriminate between oblate and prolate models for the cluster , but , as discussed in section  [ subsec : virialmass ] , our model for ellipsoidal clusters breaks down at large radii . for the spherical model , this mass",
    "is calculated for each set of shape parameters and the 68% confidence limits are derived .",
    "using an electron temperature of @xmath43 kev , the spherical geometry hse mass integrated in the 40@xmath35 radius cylindrical volume is @xmath154 , consistent with the lensing mass in the same geometry of @xmath155 .",
    "the two - component -model predicts about @xmath156 , and so it is also a consistent model .    this agreement does not guarantee that the assumptions in the hse analysis are valid , however . for this reason ,",
    "we examine possible systematic effects .",
    "some comparisons of cluster total masses derived by the hse method to lensing masses suggest that the hse method systematically underpredicts the cluster s mass ( , miralda - escud & babul 1994 , loeb & mao 1994 , wu & fang 1997 ) .",
    "some of the explanations suggested for the discrepancy include cluster ellipticity , non - thermal pressure support of the gas in the cluster core , multi - phase gas , and temperature gradients in the gas . in an examination of a large sample of clusters , however , allen ( 1998 ) suggests such discrepancies can often be resolved by taking account of cooling flows when analyzing x - ray data , and ensuring that the lensing and x - ray masses probe the same line of sight .",
    "the mass discrepancy does remain for clusters in the allen sample with small cooling flows or none , perhaps suggesting these clusters have undergone recent dynamical activity which have disrupted any pre - existing cooling flow .",
    "such activity might invalidate the hse assumption .",
    "we have been careful to ensure that the strong lensing and sz models probe the same lines of sight .",
    "there is no evidence for a cooling flow in abell 370 , although there may be other concerns about using the measured emission - weighted gas temperature .",
    "if the measured average temperature is in error , , due to contamination from a nearby agn , the mass measurements will also be in error .",
    "the sz gas mass is inversely proportional to the assumed temperature and the hse mass is directly proportional to the temperature .",
    "the gas fraction from the hse method is quite sensitive to temperature , @xmath157 .",
    "an unresolved temperature gradient in the gas may systematically affect the gas and hse masses .",
    "if such a gradient is present , the true temperature in the central region may be higher than the emission - weighted temperature we use , and the fitted shape parameters from the isothermal sz analysis may no longer accurately describe the density distribution .",
    "however , if the temperature of the intracluster medium declines slowly , and does not change appreciably over the angular scales to which we are sensitive , the interferometric measurement of the gas mass fraction at these angular scales will in fact not be strongly affected .    currently , there are no strong observational constraints on temperature structure in moderately distant and distant clusters , as there have been no suitable telescope facilities for the task .",
    "however , an attempt to quantify temperature structure observed in nearby clusters is presented in markevitch ( 1996 ) . in this work , a slow decline in temperature with radius is observed , with the temperature falling to half its central value at 6 - 10 core radii .",
    "this structure may be approximately described by a gas with a polytropic index of @xmath158 = 1.2 .",
    "( for discussion of polytropic indices , see sarazin ( 1988 ) and the references within . )",
    "if there temperature structure in abell 370 and it is of the moderate variety presented in markevitch ( 1996 ) , it will not be a strong source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "abell 370 has a long observation scheduled with the chandra observatory .",
    "chandra has the necessary spatial and spectral resolution to remove the effects of contaminating sources in the field and with a long observation , could measure the spatial variation of the cluster temperature , should it exist .",
    "the assumption that the cluster is biaxially symmetric with symmetry axis in the plane of the sky is certainly a simplification . here",
    ", we estimate the effect on the gas mass fraction of an inclined symmetry axis .",
    "analytical relationships between the inclination angle and the apparent shape of an biaxial ellipsoid are derived in fabricant , rybicki , & gorenstein ( 1984 ) .",
    "we derive the cluster gas mass and hse mass for a cluster which reproduces the observed sz map , but has an inclined symmetry axis . a biaxial cluster , when inclined , will retain a -model distribution with the same value of , but the central density and intrinsic axis ratio will change .",

    "] in order to preserve the observed sz effect , the value of the central density must vary inversely with the axis ratio .",
    "the gas mass , then , remains the same for all inclination angles .",
    "this is expected , as the gas mass is proportional to the total sz flux , independent of its spatial arrangement .",
    "we evaluate the gas and hse masses as a function of @xmath159 , using the best fit parameters from a370 . the gas mass fraction changes ,",
    "but it changes significantly over a relatively small range of allowed inclination angles ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "to compare the @xmath12 we have measured within a fixed angular radius to @xmath12 measurements in clusters with different sizes and redshift , we extrapolate our measured @xmath12 to a fiducial radius .",
    "the icm in nearby clusters has been observed to be distributed more uniformly than the dark matter ( , david  1995 ) , which is to be expected if energy has been added to the intracluster medium before collapse or from galactic winds .",
    "if this is generally true , the gas mass fraction measured depends on the radius within which the measurement is made . as suggested in evrard ( 1997 ) and metzler , evrard , & navarro ( 1998 ) , we choose this radius to be that within which the average density of the cluster is 500 times the critical density , @xmath164 .",
    "these numerical simulations suggest that within this radius , @xmath163 , the cluster s baryon fraction should closely reflect the universal baryon fraction , if the current physical models of hierarchical structure formation are correct .",

    "this is not the optimal radius at which to compare with numerical simulations , since resolution is limited in the cores of the clusters , and the gas in the core may also be sensitive to additional physics not yet included in the models , , magnetic fields and cooling . for these reasons",

    "the cluster gas mass fraction measurements can then be used within the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) paradigm to constrain : @xmath177    the value of @xmath176 is constrained by bbn calculations and the measurements of light element abundances . the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen provides a particularly strong constraint on the baryonic matter density . a firm upper limit to @xmath176",

    "this is useful not only as a distance ladder - independent measurement of , but , when compared with other  measurements , can be used to explore possible systematic effects in the @xmath12 calculation , , to constrain the deprojection of the gas distribution .",
    "however , the quality of the x - ray imaging data in this case and the apparent disagreement between the sz and x - ray fitted models do not permit putting a strong constraint on the hubble constant . a long observation with the chandra x - ray observatory towards this cluster is planned , and should help resolve these issues .",
    "the value of the baryonic mass fraction in any one cluster will be susceptible to systematic uncertainties which may be difficult to estimate . in order to use cluster gas mass fractions as a cosmological tool ,",
    "one wants to ameliorate the effect of these errors by studying a large sample of clusters .",
    "a sz effect survey in galaxy clusters is being carried out by this group at the bima and ovro observatories , and an analysis of the gas mass fraction of the sample is in preparation .",
