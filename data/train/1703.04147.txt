    "yangian for @xmath4 is the associative algebra historically one of the first examples of _ quantum groups_. the yangian @xmath1 is a hopf algebra deforming the enveloping algebra @xmath5)$ ] , where @xmath6 $ ] is the ( infinite dimensional ) lie algebra of @xmath4-valued polynomials .",
    "this algebra was considered in the works of l. fadeev and st .- petersburg school in the relation with the inverse scattering method , see e.g. @xcite . there is a family @xmath0 of commutative subalgebras in @xmath1 parameterized by complex matrices @xmath7 called bethe subalgebras .",
    "this family originates from the integrable models in statistical mechanics and algebraic bethe ansatz . for details and links on yangians , we refer the reader to the survey @xcite and to the book @xcite by a.  molev .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the maximal torus in @xmath9 i.e. the subgroup of diagonal matrices in @xmath9 . in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to bethe subalgebras with @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the set of regular elements of the torus , i.e. the set of matrices from @xmath8 with pairwise distinct eigenvalues .",
    "in @xcite nazarov and olshanski showed that @xmath0 is a free polynomial algebra and that it is a maximal commutative subalgebra in @xmath1 for all @xmath12 . for non - regular @xmath13 ,",
    "the subalgebra @xmath0 becomes smaller .",
    "but there is a natural way to obtain commutative subalgebras of the same size as for @xmath12 by taking some _ limits _ of regular ones .",
    "for example , one can get the gelfand - tsetlin subalgebra ( also known as cartan subalgebra ) of the yangian as a limit of some @xmath14-parametic family of bethe subalgebras with @xmath15 .",
    "our goal is to describe all limit subalgebras .    the same question ( to describe all limit subalgebras ) for the images of bethe subalgebras in the universal enveloping algebra @xmath16 under the evaluation homomorphism ( under the name of `` shift of argument subalgebras '' )",
    "was asked by vinberg in late 1990-s .",
    "the answer was given by v.shuvalov in @xcite and later in more algebro - geometric terms by l.  aguirre , g.  felder and a.  veselov in @xcite .",
    "their description is roughly as follows .",
    "shift of argument subalgebras themselves are parametrized by regular diagonal @xmath17-matrices up to proportionality and up to adding a scalar matrix .",
    "the latter can be regarded as the space of configurations of @xmath18 pairwise distinct points on the complex line .",
    "it turns out that the limit shift of argument subalgebras are parametrized by the deligne - mumford closure of this space @xcite , all limit subalgebras are free @xcite and maximal commutative @xcite , and moreover there is an explicit inductive procedure generating the limit subalgebras from smaller shift of argument subalgebras assigned to smaller @xmath18 .",
    "it is natural to expect a similar description for limit bethe subalgebras in the yangian .",
    "the construction of bethe algebras can be regarded as a regular map from @xmath11 to the `` grassmannian '' of subspaces in @xmath1 of the same `` dimension '' as @xmath0 .",
    "the space @xmath11 is noncompact while the grassmannian is ( in appropriate sense ) compact .",
    "so we can take the closure of the image of this map and obtain new subalgebras with the same poincare series .",
    "we call such subalgebras _ limit subalgebras .",
    "_    since the subalgebras @xmath0 do not change under dilations of @xmath2 , the parameter space for the family @xmath0 is the quotient @xmath19 of the set of regular elements of the torus by the subgroup of scalar matrices . following @xcite we can regard the space @xmath19 as the moduli space @xmath20 of rational curves with @xmath21 marked points ( we can assign to a matrix @xmath2 with the eigenvalues @xmath22 the curve @xmath23 with the marked points @xmath24 ) .",
    "the limit subalgebras of the family @xmath0 are thus parametrized by some compactification of the space @xmath20 .",
    "the main results of the present paper can be summarized as follows :    * main theorem . *",
    "_ the closure of @xmath19 which parametrizes the limit subalgebras is isomorphic to the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath3 .",
    "all limit subalgebras are free polynomial algebras and maximal commutative subalgebras in @xmath1 .",
    "_    in fact we will describe all limit subalgebras as products of smaller bethe subalgebras and some shift of argument subalgebras ( which are the images of bethe subalgebras in the universal enveloping algebra @xmath16 under the evaluation map ) .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to reduce this problem to the similar one for the family of shift of argument subalgebras in @xmath25 where @xmath26 is big enough . for this",
    "we use on the one hand the olshanski centralizer construction @xcite which approximates the yangian @xmath1 by the centralizer subalgebras of the form @xmath27 , and , on the other hand , the results of shuvalov @xcite and tarasov @xcite which describe the limit subalgebras for the family of shift of argument subalgebras .",
    "let @xmath28 be the image of @xmath29 under the evaluation homomorphism @xmath30 . the subalgebra @xmath31 does not change after adding a scalar matrix to @xmath2 .",
    "the associated graded of @xmath31 is a poisson commutative subalgebra @xmath32 known as _ shift of argument subalgebra",
    "_ since it is generated by the adjoint invariants from @xmath33 shifted by @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",

    ". then the algebra @xmath36 contains the quadratic elements @xmath37 which are the coefficients of ( an appropriate version of ) the @xmath38 connection .",
    "moreover both @xmath36 and @xmath31 are uniquely determined by the linear span @xmath39 of the @xmath40 s .",
    "note that @xmath40 do not change under simultaneous affine transformations of the @xmath41 s , hence the space of parameters of the corresponding shift of argument subalgebras is naturally the configuration space of @xmath18 pairwise distinct points on the affine line or , equivalently , the configuration space @xmath42 of @xmath43 pairwise distinct points on the projective line . from the results of aguirre , felder and veselov @xcite it follows that the closure of the family of subspaces @xmath44 is the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath45 , which is crucial for our proof .",
    "let @xmath46 $ ] be the filtered polynomial algebra of infinitely many generators such that @xmath47 .",
    "the olshanski centralizer construction @xcite is the collection of surjective homomorphisms of filtered algebras @xmath48 generalizing the evaluation map .",
    "the intersection of kernels of such homomorphisms is known to be zero , so this collection of homomorphisms can be regarded as an _ an asymptotic isomorphism _",
    "i.e. for each filtered component of @xmath49 there is @xmath50 such that for any @xmath51 the restriction of the above homomorphism to this filtered component is an isomorphism .",
    "the idea of our proof is to analyze the parameter spaces of the images of @xmath0 under the centralizer construction maps . since centralizer construction is an asymptotical isomorphism the closure of the parameter space stabilizes for @xmath52 .",
    "we prove that the image of @xmath53 in the centralizer algebra @xmath27 is contained in some non - regular shift - of - argument subalgebra @xmath54 ( proposition  [ incl ] ) and moreover @xmath54 is asymptotically isomorphic to @xmath53 .",
    "we show that the closure of the parameter space for the subalgebras @xmath54 is @xmath3 ( realized as a subvariety in @xmath55 which parametrizes all limit shift of argument subalgebras in @xmath56 ) .",
    "since the closure of the parameter space for @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath57 , the closure of the parameter space for bethe subalgebras in @xmath1 is @xmath3 as well .",
    "next , we deduce from the results of shuvalov and tarasov that any limit of the algebras @xmath54 is a free polynomial algebra and a maximal commutative subalgebra in @xmath27 . since @xmath53 is asymptotically isomorphic to @xmath54 , the same is true for limit bethe subalgebras corresponding to points of @xmath3 ( theorem [ result ] ) . using shuvalov s description of limit shift - of - argument subalgebras",
    "we explicitly describe the simplest limits corresponding to generic points of codimension @xmath14 strata in @xmath3 in terms of bethe subalgebras for smaller yangians and shift - of - argument subalgebras for smaller lie algebras ( theorem [ result2 ] ) .",
    "iterating this we obtain the explicit description of all limit bethe subalgebras .      to any semisimple lie algebra @xmath58 ( and even more generally , to any kac - moody algebra @xmath58 )",
    "one can assign the yangian @xmath59 , the quantum group generated by the rational r - matrix of @xmath58 . to any element @xmath2 of the cartan torus @xmath8 of @xmath58 one",
    "can assign a bethe subalgebra generated by traces of the products of @xmath2 with the r - matrix in all integrable representations .",
    "this is a commutative subalgebra which is expected to be maximal for regular @xmath2 .",
    "the variety parametrizing all possible limits of such commutative subalgebras is a compactification of the set @xmath11 of regular elements of the torus ( well - defined as a pro - algebraic scheme ) .",
    "our theorem  [ result ] states that in the case @xmath60 it is @xmath3 .",
    "the natural generalization of this to lie algebras of other types is the de concini  procesi closure @xcite of the complement to the following arrangement of subvarieties in a toric variety .",
    "consider the toric variety @xmath61 ( acted on by the maximal torus @xmath62 ) which corresponds to the fan determined by the root hyperplanes .",
    "equivalently , @xmath61 is the closure of a generic @xmath8-orbit in the flag variety @xmath63",
    ". we can regard @xmath11 as a complement of an arrangement of hypersurfaces in @xmath61 .",
    "following de concini and procesi @xcite , one can construct a compactification @xmath64 of @xmath11 by blowing up all indecomposable intersections of the hypersurfaces in @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath64 is the parameter space for limit subalgebras of the family of bethe subalgebras in the yangian @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath3 is the de concini  procesi closure of @xmath11 for @xmath60 .    for infinite root systems ( say , for affine kac - moody ) @xmath65 is not well - defined as an algebraic scheme but is still well - defined as a pro - algebraic scheme . on the other hand , in this case",
    "the bethe subalgebras themselves live not in the yangian but rather in its completion which is an inverse limit of some quotients of the yangian .",
    "so we can generalize our conjecture to yangians of infinite - dimensional lie algebras by stating that two inverse limits are isomorphic .",
    "by analogy with the shift - of - argument algebras and gaudin algebras , we expect that for real values of the parameter the corresponding ( limit ) bethe algebra has simple spectrum in any irreducible finite - dimensional ( or integrable ) representation of the yangian .",
    "following @xcite , one can assign a covering of @xmath66 to any irreducible representation of @xmath59 .",
    "the fiber of such covering is just the set of joint eigenlines for the elements of a bethe algebra in this representation . for kirillov - reshetikhin modules ,",
    "we expect a natural bijection of the fiber of this covering with the corresponding kirillov - reshetikhin crystal hence obtaining an action of the fundamental group @xmath67 on the crystal .",
    "we also expect that this action can be described in purely combinatorial terms .      in section  2 we recall some known facts about yangians and bethe subalgebras .",
