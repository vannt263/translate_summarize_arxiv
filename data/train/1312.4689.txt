    "the development of optical lattice systems based on laser technology has renewed interest in strongly correlated lattice systems .",
    "one of the most striking phenomena of the optical - lattice systems is the superfluid - mott insulator ( sf - mi ) phase transition ; the sf phase ( i.e. , the coherent - matter - wave phase ) emerges when the kinetic energy is larger enough compared with the on - site repulsive interaction .",
    "otherwise , the mi phase , i.e. , the number - state phase without coherence emerges .",
    "the low - lying excitations of these optical - lattice systems can be described by using the bose  hubbard model .",
    "the temperature of trapped - atom systems can be extremely low , and hence , we hereafter assume the ground states of the system .",
    "spin degrees of freedom also play an important role in optical - lattice systems . in theory ,",
    "lots of analytical and numerical studies have been performed for the spin-1 bose  hubbard model @xcite , including rigorous results for a finite system @xcite . in the case of antiferromagnetic spin - spin interactions , the perturbative mean - field approximation ( pmfa ) @xcite indicates that when filling with an even number of bosons , the mi phase is considerably more stable against the sf phase than when filling with an odd number of bosons .",
    "this conjecture has been found by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "recently , qmc methods also confirmed that conjecture in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of the spin-1 bose  hubbard model with antiferromagnetic interactions is the first - order phase transition : the sf - mi phase transition is of the first order in a part of the sf - mi phase diagram .",
    "the first - order transition has also been studied by using the variational monte carlo @xcite and qmc @xcite methods in a 2d square lattice .",
    "the qmc results indicate that the phase transition can be of the first order , which is consistent with mean - field ( mf ) analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the first - order transition disappears for strong antiferromagnetic interactions ; a mf calculation similar to that of ref . @xcite and",
    "the qmc study @xcite show that the first - order sf - mi transition from the mott lobe with two bosons per site disappears when @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus , we assume strong interactions where the sf - mi transition is of the second order .    for the second - order sf - mi transition , the strong - coupling expansion of kinetic energy @xcite is excellent for obtaining the phase boundary .",
    "this method has been applied to the spinless @xcite , extended @xcite , hardcore @xcite , and two - species models @xcite , and the results agree well with qmc results @xcite .",
    "thus , in this study , we perform the strong - coupling expansion with the spin-1 bose  hubbard model . in another publication @xcite",
    ", we examined the case of hypercubic lattices . in this study",
    ", we examine the triangular lattice and compare the results with those of a square lattice to clarify whether the lattice structure plays a key role for the sf - mi transition .",
    "the triangular lattice is intriguing because it frustrates the spin systems or spinful fermi systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii briefly introduces the spin-1 bose  hubbard model and the strong - coupling expansion .",

    "the dimerized state is degenerate with @xmath31 for @xmath32 and is considered to be the ground state for finite @xmath0 in 1d . therefore , the results based on @xmath31 are basically limited to 2d or larger dimensions .",

    "hence the results obtained by qmc methods are in between those obtained by the chemical - potential fitting and pmfa , at least in the case of the square lattice where qmc has been performed .",

    "the fitting curves smooth and natural as expected , and the values of @xmath46 are clearly improved .",
    "overall , there has been no essential difference in the phase boundary curves for the square and triangular lattices .",
    "this might be due to our assumption that the zeroth order in @xmath0 mi state is a nematic state .",
    "however , qmc study @xcite of the square lattice indicates that the magnetic structure factor shows no trace of magnetic order anywhere in the phase diagram .",
