    "we report the results of an extensive computational study of the broadcaster repacking problem , which plays a central role in the fcc s proposed incentive auctions .",
    "the incentive auctions are designed to repurpose broadcast television spectrum for wireless broadband use , and the reverse auction portion necessitates that broadcasters not cleared by the process be repacked onto lower frequencies .",
    "co - channel and adjacent channel interference constraints , as well as those presented by international borders and other issues , make repacking a computationally challenging task .",
    "while the fcc is currently considering a particular descending clock mechanism for the reverse auction , as well as other potential mechanisms , the problem of determining which subsets of broadcasters can be feasibly repacked at a given nationwide clearing target is one that must be addressed by _ any _ mechanism .",
    "the structure and constraints on this solution space are thus `` mechanism - free '' and of fundamental interest , and they are the subject of our study .",
    "examples of the types of questions we pose and investigate here include :    * _ for a given nationwide clearing target , what is the minimum number of broadcasters that must be cleared in order for there to exist a feasible repacking solution for the remaining broadcasters , and how does this number increase with higher clearing targets ? _ * _ for a given nationwide clearing target , how many broadcasters must be cleared from each local market in order for there to exist a feasible repacking solution , and how variable is this number from solution to solution ? _ * _ what is the cost of border constraints in terms of the number of broadcasters cleared and its geographic distribution ? _ * _ how diverse is the space of possible feasible solutions at a given clearing target ? _ * _ how do the answers to such questions change under varying assumptions on the participation decisions of different classes of broadcasters ( such as network affiliates ) ?",
    "_    to investigate these questions and related ones , we have implemented a computational framework in which the feasibility of repacking is formulated as an instance of the satisfiability of a boolean formula that captures the nationwide interference constraints provided by fcc data , and the existence of solutions is determined using the open - source software package picosat .",
    "our experimental platform is thus very similar to that used in recent intensive fcc studies , but our purpose is complementary : whereas the fcc studies have naturally focused on greatly improving the computational efficiency of determining repacking feasibility for the real - time needs of a live auction , our focus here is on elucidating the fine - grained structure of the solution space , and the constraints on it ; computational efficiency is only a secondary concern .",
    "we wish to emphasize from the outset that all of our findings are the results of logical and numerical computations performed using publicly released fcc data , and in some cases , models and assumptions for the probabilities of participation by broadcasters and groups of broadcasters .",
    "consequently _ all results and conclusions reported here should be viewed as contingent on the quality and accuracy of that data , and the validity of those assumptions . _",
    "we make no claims about the generalization of our results to other data sets or assumptions , and for this reason we encourage the reader to focus more on the qualitative and relative findings ( such as the rate at which broadcaster clearings must increase with clearing target , or the geographic locations of broadcaster clearings and their relative distribution ) , as opposed to the precise numerical values we do indeed provide .",
    "the qualitative and relative findings are more likely to survive plausible changes to the data ( such as fcc revisions to interference and border constraints ) and assumptions ( such as alternate broadcaster participation models ) ; the precise numerical findings are less likely to .",
    "our analyses fall into two categories that can be thought of as what `` must '' happen in the repacking solution space , and what `` might '' happen . in the `` must '' category",
    ", we assume that in principle every broadcaster is willing to relinquish their license ( at some price ) , and investigate solution space structure such as the smallest number of broadcaster clearings required nationwide , or on a market - by - market basis , at a given clearing target .",
    "one can view these as thought experiments into the most clearing - efficient solutions available , acknowledging that they do not account for practical considerations on participation .",
    "we refer to these as `` must '' or absolute analyses because they investigate purely mathematical and structural constraints on the solution space ; there is simply no getting around these constraints , regardless of the mechanism or the prices it offers .",
    "these analyses are not only mechanism - free , they are also `` model - free '' regarding participation decisions by individual broadcasters , since we explicitly assume any broadcaster is willing to clear .",
    "while this is valuable in identifying the absolute constraints on repacking solutions , it is unrealistic in the sense that we may have prior knowledge or beliefs about the likelihood of participation by certain broadcasters or classes of broadcasters , such as network affiliates . in other words , rather than only identifying what `` must '' happen purely from solution space constraints , we also interested in what `` might '' happen under various participation models .",
    "these models are not meant to reflect predictions or judgments about participation , but rather to examine hypothetical outcomes under varying participation assumptions .",
    "the participation models we examine take the form of a joint probability distribution over participation decisions by broadcasters ; more formally , we represent each broadcaster s availability for clearing ( again , at some unspecified price ) as a binary random variable .",
    "the joint distribution of these variables for all broadcasters nationwide can then be designed to capture prior beliefs about correlations in participation across groups of broadcasters .    from joan : i tend to want to stay away from any absolute most efficient model ",
    "i do nt want to identify any specific broadcasters as essential and i do nt want to even hint at the fact that the fcc might have reasons / incentive to encourage any specific broadcaster to exit .",
    "those will be lightening rods , particularly for nab who will be quick to remind us that this is voluntary , and take away from the broader importance of the study .",
    "i would prefer to focus more generally on the study of likely scenarios ( random , affiliation - based probabilities , revenue - based probabilities ) layered with your now growing dma - based study at different clearing targets and what might be learned from that .",
    "even there i m not sure i m interested in the absolute smallest number of surrenders in each market but the number of surrenders associated with multiple repacking solutions , with and without the border constraints , suggesting that what is actually likely to happen at auction can be viewed as contained within that range .",
    "i m also interested in teasing out some of your very interesting observations .",
    "for example , its not intuitively obvious why comparing 84 to 96 requires only about 1 additional broadcaster to be cleared in many markets .",
    "i assume this says something about what s available in repacking efficiency and perhaps a lesser number of repacking options available at the higher clearing target but still doable .",
    "i also find your stmt about the `` cost '' of the border constraints very interesting and think that s worthy of some explanation as well .    to give perhaps the simplest example , suppose one believed that roughly a fraction @xmath0 of all broadcasters will choose not to participate , and that each broadcaster will make an independent , random participation decision .",
    "this ( perhaps naive ) assumption could be modeled by the standard binomial distribution @xmath1 which simply corresponds to a distribution in which each broadcaster @xmath2 flips a ( biased ) coin with probability @xmath0 of coming up heads ( @xmath3 , representing non - participation and thus forcing repacking ) and @xmath4 of coming up tails ( @xmath5 , representing participation or availability for clearing ) .",
    "already for this most basic model of participation , one can ask a computationally and analytically non - trivial question of interest : as a function of @xmath0 , how much spectrum might one expect to clear nationwide ? computationally , this can be answered by drawing samples @xmath6 repeatedly from the distribution @xmath7 , and determining via satisfiability testing whether the set of broadcasters @xmath2 for which @xmath8 can be feasibly repacked at various clearing targets .",
    "thus such analyses are methodologically very similar to the `` must '' analyses above , but have a crucial conceptual difference : while the `` must '' analyses identify unavoidable mathematical constraints on repacking , here we have a model @xmath7 for participation decisions , and any conclusions are of course dependent on the model chosen .    in principle",
    "our framework can accommodate any joint distribution @xmath9 , allowing us to explore scenarios in which the participation decisions of various groups of broadcasters are correlated in varying ways and strengths .",
    "for example , one might posit that network affiliate ( e.g. abc , nbc , cbs ) broadcasters might make decisions that are more likely to be in agreement with each other than the overall population of broadcasters .",
    "such beliefs can be modeled by the introduction of hidden variables in the form of a distribution that correlates affiliates of a specific network or affiliates in general in a hierarchical fashion .",
    "similarly , we can examine joint participation distributions that correlate participation behavior with broadcaster revenue or other economic , geographic or demographic properties of broadcasters .",
    "for instance , one can posit distributions in which the most profitable broadcasters are less likely to participate , or in which the participation of a coalition of broadcasters with a shared corporate parent are correlated .",
    "for any proposed model @xmath9 ( which we view as the input to such analyses , with all subsequent findings being conditioned on the plausibility and realism of the input model ) , our broad methodology remains the same : for various clearing targets , we estimate the probability of being able to successfully clear that target ( repack the non - participants ) , and perform a variety of related analyses .",
    "to begin , we formally define the repacking problem , and describe our data and experimental framework .",
    "we run our experiments on a dataset obtained by filtering the us baseline provided by the fcc on july 22^nd^ 2013 .",
    "we only consider the 1672 broadcasters currently assigned to uhf channels ( 14 - 51 ) .",
    "we ignore low and high vhf stations because they are unlikely to be repacked onto the uhf band .",
    "the goal of the repacking process is to assign broadcasters to a subset of the 38 channels in the uhf band , and therefore clear a large contiguous block of spectrum . because each channel uses six mhz of spectrum , reaching a clearing target of @xmath10 mhz is equivalent to clearing @xmath11 channels .",
    "this leaves @xmath12 channels available for repacking .",
    "channels , because channel 37 is reserved for public safety broadcast .",
    "thus , there will only @xmath13 channels available for repacking . ]",
    "a solution @xmath14 to the repacking problem consists of an assignment of broadcasters to the remaining @xmath15 channels .",
    "let @xmath16 denote that the solution assigns broadcaster @xmath2 to channel @xmath17 .",
    "a feasible solution must obey a number of _ interference constraints_. the fcc has used specialized software ( oet-69 ) to decide , for every pair of stations , whether the pair can be assigned to the same or adjacent channels .",
    "the results were publicly released on july 22^nd^ 2013 in the form of binary matrices .",
    "there are three types of interference constraints .",
    "a _ co - channel _ constraint indicates that two broadcasters @xmath18 can not be assigned to the same channel in an assignment , or equivalently @xmath19",
    "adj - channel - up _ constraint indicates that broadcaster @xmath2 can not be placed on the channel above another broadcaster @xmath20",
    ", i.e. @xmath21 , and an _ adj - channel - down _ constraint indicates that broadcaster @xmath2 can not be placed on the channel below another broadcaster @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "a feasible solution must also obey a set of _ domain constraints _ , each of which enforces that a broadcaster @xmath2 can not be assigned to a particular channel @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "the majority of domain constraints are a result of international treaties with canada and mexico , which forbid us stations from being assigned to channels on which they would interfere with stations across the border .",
    "the fcc has also released a description of these constraints in the form of a binary matrix . because these current domain constraints may or may not restrain the ultimate auction , we have run our experiments both including and excluding these constraints",
    ". the reality will therefore lie somewhere between the two results .",
    "we note that all of our reported results forbid any assignment or repacking onto the public safety broadcast channel 37 , even when border and other domain constraints have been dropped . however , when domain constraints are excluded , other non - border domain constraints , such as those involving t band public safety channels , are excluded as well .    given a clearing target @xmath10 and a set @xmath24 of broadcasters that must be repacked , our goal is to find a feasible channel assignment . we first encode the constraints described above as boolean formulae .",
    "in particular , we write formulae to ensure that :    1 .",
    "each broadcaster in @xmath24 is repacked onto exactly one channel .",
    "@xmath12 channels are not occupied by any broadcaster .",
    "3 .   all interference and domain constraints are satisfied .",
    "there are some optional parameters as well ; i.e. we can specify a maximum number @xmath25 of broadcasters to clear nationwide , a maximum number @xmath26 of broadcasters to clear from a particular dma , and a maximum number @xmath27 of dmas in which clearing is allowed to occur . each of these additional constraints can also be encoded as boolean formulae .",
    "the complete encoding is provided in the technical appendix in section [ sec : cnf ] .",
    "we then give these formulae as input to picosat , an open - source sat solver initially developed in 2007 by armin biere at johannes kepler university in austria .",
    "if a feasible solution exists , picosat will typically find a corresponding channel assignment in 30 seconds or less . if the constraints are unsatisfiable , however , picosat may or may not quickly find proof of infeasibility . in our experiments , we assume infeasibility after 60 seconds have elapsed .",
    "although we have run the reported experiments on a wide range of clearing targets , and both with and without domain constraints , in the interests of brevity we sometimes choose to report results only for an 84 mhz clearing target without domain constraints , since this target has been frequently used as an example in other writings about the incentive auctions .",
    "we have no opinion on the optimal or appropriate clearing target for the auction .",
    "we begin our results with perhaps the most basic of `` must '' analyses : if we assume that every broadcaster is willing to relinquish their license at some unspecified price , what is the absolute _ minimum _ number of broadcasters that must be cleared in order to meet a given nationwide target ?    the answer is provided in figure  [ fig : absmin ] . to generate this figure , we encoded boolean formulae that specified not only the clearing target , but also a maximum number @xmath28 of broadcasters allowed to be cleared in the solution .",
    "by gradually reducing @xmath28 for a given clearing target until the point that the formula is determined to be infeasible , we identify the smallest number of clearings required . in the figure",
    ", we show plots both incorporating and ignoring the domain constraints .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : absmin ] , the minimum number of clearings required increases approximately linearly , and reasonably gradually , with the nationwide target ; even this fact is not self - evident from first principles .",
    "specific values of interest can be read directly from the plot , such as slightly less than 200 broadcaster clearings being required for clearing an 84 mhz target ignoring border constraints .",
    "the gap between the two curves reveals that the cost of the currently released domain constraints is approximately 50 additional broadcaster clearings , regardless of the nationwide target .",
    "if one believes the current domain constraints to be overly conservative , this cost would presumably be lower .",
    "we again emphasize that in this analysis , _ all _ broadcasters are considered as candidates for clearing  in effect , we are letting the satisfiability solver choose the particular set that is cleared in service of reaching the given clearing target . at lower clearing targets , there are many possible solutions with many possible sets of cleared broadcasters ; at higher targets , these choices become more constrained .",
    "we shall comment further on the diversity of the solution space below .",
    "figure  [ fig : absmin ] identifies the most basic and nationwide constraints on clearing a given amount of spectrum .",
    "we next report on absolute clearing constraints on a finer geographic scale , namely at the level of individual markets or dmas .",
    "more specifically , in order to achieve a given nationwide target efficiently ( in the sense of figure  [ fig : absmin ] ) , and again assuming every broadcaster is a candidate for clearing , how many broadcasters must be cleared in each market ?",
    "a meaningful answer to this question requires that we make it a bit more precise .",
    "first , since we are interested primarily in solutions that are efficient in the number of clearings nationwide , we encode the constraint that this number be not too much larger ( say , 5% ) than the values dictated by figure [ fig : absmin ] ; otherwise , we permit the trivial solution in which all broadcasters are cleared and essentially any target can be reached .",
    "the more subtle issue is how to constrain clearings on a per - dma basis .",
    "this could be done by adding constraints that specify a maximum number @xmath28 of broadcasters allowed to be cleared in a particular dma , and gradually reduce @xmath28 until infeasibility occurs .",
    "such an approach would determine the minimum number of broadcasters that must be cleared in this dma to achieve feasibility ; we could then repeat for each dma .",
    "the problem with this approach is that there is no guarantee that all the individual per - dma minima found can be achieved _",
    "simultaneously _ in a single feasible solution  indeed , this is certainly not the case .",
    "for instance , clearing the minimum number of broadcasters in one dma will frequently necessitate that extra broadcasters are cleared in neighboring dmas , a consequence of so - called `` daisy - chain '' or constraint propagation effects .",
    "( we shall demonstrate these effects in a precise sense shortly . )    thus at the dma level , it is more informative to examine `` typical '' nationwide feasible solutions and then measure the average number of broadcaster clearings occur in each dma .",
    "more precisely , for a given nationwide clearing target , and fixing the total number of broadcasters cleared at ( approximately ) the minimum possible as given in figure  [ fig : absmin ] , there will in general be _ many _ feasible repacking solutions that vary in the geographic distribution of cleared broadcasters . because the algorithm used by picosat is randomized",
    ", we can run it multiple times in order to sample this solution space .    in table",
    "[ tab : dma ] , we show sample results for exactly such an experiment .",
    "the data underlying this table consisted of 300 sampled feasible repacking solutions at an 84 mhz clearing target and with the total number of broadcaster clearings constrained to be at most 206 ( 10 larger than the minimum possible ) , and ignoring domain constraints for the moment . from these sampled solutions ,",
    "we compute the average number of broadcaster clearings within each of the 210 dmas , as well as the standard deviations of this quantity . we also report the minimum number of clearings observed in the sample for each dma .",
    "together these metrics provide us with a geographically granular view of the space of feasible solutions .",
    "table [ tab : dma ] shows the top dmas when sorting by the average number of broadcaster clearings .",
    "unsurprisingly , at the top of the list we find large and `` congested '' markets like new york city , philadelphia , and chicago . but",
    "some less obvious challenge areas appear as well , such as large swaths of south florida , north carolina , and ohio .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in the highest ranked dmas , the standard deviations are small compared to the averages themselves .",
    "for instance , in new york city , the average solution required about 10 broadcasters to be cleared , and the standard deviation is only about 1 . of the 300 sampled solutions ,",
    "the minimum number of clearings observed in this dma was 8 .",
    "this suggests that , at least statistically speaking ( and with respect to the distribution over solutions generated by picosat ) , that there is very little flexibility in the amount of clearing required in these largest markets , especially when considered simultaneously and in the aggregate . in the lower ranked markets ,",
    "the standard deviation is much closer to the mean , which suggests that there is considerably more flexibility in these markets .",
    "two different visualizations of the distribution of clearings required across all dmas are provided in figures  [ fig : dmabar ] and [ fig : map ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmabar ] visualizes the sorted average number of clearings required per dma , overlaid with the standard deviations . figure  [ fig : map ] projects the same information onto a geographic map , both with and without domain constraints .    for comparison",
    ", we also used the alternate boolean formulae approach discussed above to find the absolute minimum number of broadcasters that must be cleared in each dma _ in isolation _ , while still requiring a near - optimal amount of clearing nationwide . recall that these minima can certainly not be achieved simultaneously in a single solution .",
    "rather , for each dma , a solution does exist in which the minimum for that particular dma is achieved .",
    "interestingly , these absolute minimum single - dma values are 0 for almost all dmas , including many of the largest , meaning we can essentially avoid clearing _ any _ broadcasters in any particular dma if we are willing to pay a higher price in neighboring markets .",
    "+   +      above we have argued that the absolute minimum number of clearings required in a specific dma , or even the minimum number observed in our sample for that dma , may be misleading quantities for understanding what can be plausibly achieved , and that the sample averages are more appropriate guides to expectations .",
    "as we have intimated , this is due to what are sometimes referred to as `` daisy - chain '' effects , more technically described as propagation over the network of network of interference constraints .",
    "the fundamental issue is that if we clear less in one market , we may have to clear more in surrounding markets .",
    "here we provide some quantitative analysis of such effects .",
    "since each of our 300 sampled solutions specifies how many clearings were required in each dma to reach the nationwide clearing target , we can examine which pairs of dmas have the strongest correlations  positive or negative  in terms of number of clearings .",
    "if daisy - chain effects are present and strong , we would expect the most negative correlations to be large in magnitude , and between geographically proximate dmas .",
    "this expectation is strongly borne out by table  [ tab : corrpos ] , where we list the topmost negatively correlated dma pairs . level . ]",
    "these pairs are all geographically adjacent dmas , and also generally in highly congested regions requiring large amounts of clearing .",
    "thus while it is clear that in any individual dma we may observe ( or be able to enforce ) a small amount of clearing , in congested areas this only `` pushes the problem elsewhere '' in a quantifiable sense .",
    "it is worth noting that there are also weaker but still significant _ positively _ correlated dma pairs , which are more difficult to understand intuitively but still potentially meaningful daisy - chain effects .",
    "for instance , the most strongly positively correlated pair is",
    "miami - ft .",
    "lauderdale , fl and charlotte , nc whose sample correlation is 0.191 and statistically significant .",
    "while this magnitude is considerably smaller than those for the top negatively correlated pairs , such positive correlations may capture longer - distance or `` second order '' daisy - chain effects .",
    "one example would be subtle `` alternation '' effects  for instance , if dma @xmath14 is to the north of dma @xmath29 , which in turn lies north of dma @xmath30 , then @xmath14 and @xmath29 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 , will be negatively correlated ; but @xmath14 and @xmath30 may be positively correlated , because when there is more clearing in @xmath14 , less is required in @xmath29 , but that necessitates clearing more in @xmath30 .",
    ".__top positively correlated dma pairs in terms of number of clearings in sampled solutions .",

    "0.5918 +          finally , while so far we have reported on the absolute constraints on feasible solutions at the national and per - dma levels , each sampled solution of course commits to specific choices of which individual broadcasters are cleared and repacked .",
    "while we shall refrain from providing detailed analyses and identities at the broadcaster level , it is instructive to investigate the frequency with which each broadcaster is cleared in the effort to reach a nationwide target in our sample of 300 solutions . figure  [ fig : bcdifficulty ] shows the fraction of samples in which each broadcaster is cleared , after sorting broadcasters by the same quantity .",
    "there are a few broadcasters who are cleared almost always ",
    "one is cleared in 97% of samples , and there are 3 others who are cleared in 96% .",
    "these are broadcasters that , at least with respect to the distribution of solutions generated by picosat , present a relatively challenging interference profile that leads to frequent clearing .",
    "however , the dropoff is steep , with only 14 broadcasters who were cleared in more than 90% of solutions .",
    "note also that there are 1672 broadcasters in total , and a very large fraction are not cleared in any solution .",
    "thus it appears that the hard constraints on regional clearing emerge only at the dma level and above , and not at the resolution of individual broadcasters .",
    "all the analyses presented so far assume that every broadcaster participates in the auction and is willing to be cleared off the air .",
    "this assumption allows us to identify the absolute and purely structural constraints on the solution space , at the national , dma , and broadcaster levels .",
    "however , this approach also ignores any assumptions , beliefs or information we have about the relative likelihood that various broadcasters will participate in the auction . to analyze what `` might '' occur , rather than what `` must ''",
    ", we consider a different type of analysis that incorporates models of broadcaster participation . in doing so , we do not seek to make any judgment about who should participate .",
    "we simply seek to explore repacking feasibility given specific and varying assumption sets for the purpose of understanding likely outcomes .",
    "our models are expressed as joint probability distributions over broadcaster participation decisions .",
    "we can design this distribution to reflect various assumptions about the probabilities of , and correlations between , broadcaster participation decisions , and therefore obtain results that more closely model reality under our beliefs . rather than extracting information at the dma level ,",
    "this analysis focuses on groups of broadcasters sharing similar properties , such as network affiliate status .",
    "we now outline the nature and purpose of each of the successive models we examine .",
    "each of these models specifies a parameterized class of joint probability distributions @xmath9 over the vector @xmath6 of broadcaster participation decisions . because the technical specification of the more complex models is somewhat mathematical , we defer these details to the technical appendix in section  [ sec : part - models ] .",
    "* _ random broadcasters model .",
    "_ this is our simplest model , which has a single parameter @xmath0 representing the probability each broadcaster chooses _ not _ to participate in the auction ( or exits without clearing ) , and is therefore repacked ; thus with probability @xmath32 , the broadcaster is cleared .",
    "each broadcaster makes an independent decision of this type , hence the name of the model . in this model",
    "there will be no correlations between the participation decisions of different broadcasters . by choosing or varying the value of @xmath0 , we can model more or less ( probabilistic ) participation in the overall population of broadcasters . obviously by making @xmath0 larger",
    ", we expect to make the probability of reaching any fixed clearing target smaller ; the question is what the form and rate of this relationship takes . *",
    "_ random affiliates model . _",
    "the assumption that all broadcasters make their decisions independently is obviously a vast oversimplification , so we also consider models allowing correlations between the decisions of related subsets of broadcasters .",
    "the random affiliates model represents a scenario in which there are separate and independent events controlling the participation of each network affiliate group ( abc , nbc , fox , cbs , pbs ) , capturing the notion that ( for example ) internal corporate decisions or influences at each affiliate may strongly determine the participation decisions of its constituents . in this model , if the event for a particular affiliate group occurs , which happens with probability @xmath0 , then _ all members _ decline to participate in the auction . if the event does not occur , then all members in the affiliate group participate .",
    "all non - affiliates still make an independent decision , again with probability @xmath0 of non - participation .",
    "note that for any fixed value of @xmath0 , the _ marginal _ ( that is , isolated ) probability of any particular broadcaster not participating will be @xmath0 , exactly as in the random broadcasters model .",
    "however , now very strong correlations are present in the joint distribution  namely , knowing the participation status of any broadcaster in an affiliate group immediately determines the same status for all others in the group .",
    "we recognize that this model still oversimplifies the complex decision - making broadcasters will undertake in determining whether to participate or not , but we believe this offers a refinement of the random broadcasters models that is useful in determining the effects of affiliate correlations . * _ correlated affiliates model . _",
    "this model captures an even richer scenario , in which there is not only correlation between the broadcasters within an affiliate , but also across affiliates themselves  thus rather than no correlations at all ( random broadcasters model ) , or only one `` layer '' of correlation ( random affiliates model ) , now we have two layers of correlation  one between affiliates , and one between broadcasters within an affiliate .",
    "the top - level correlation captures the outcome of events that might strongly influence the participation decisions of all the network affiliates .",
    "again , the model is designed so that the marginal probability of non - participation is a fixed value @xmath0 across all broadcasters , and can be varied to examine different assumptions on the background rate of participation nationwide .",
    "non - affiliates still remain independent of all other broadcasters with probability @xmath0 of non - participation .",
    "( see section  [ sec : part - models ] for technical specifications . )",
    "this permits direct comparison to the models above at a given marginal rate @xmath0 , allowing us to isolate the effects of the correlations alone .",
    "* _ broadcaster revenue model .",
    "_ we also consider a model that considers broadcaster revenue as well as affiliate status .",
    "we assume that both affiliates and broadcasters with high revenue are less likely to participate in the auction . at its core , this model is similar to the random broadcasters model , in the sense that each broadcaster makes an independent participation decision and thus there are no correlations .",
    "however , unlike the previous model , here each broadcaster s probability of non - participation is different .",
    "informally , we increase the probability of non - participation with the broadcaster s revenue , and also amplify it for network affiliates ; see section  [ sec : part - models ] for details .",
    "although in the descriptions above we refer to probabilistic events and correlations , we can informally and alternately view the models as capturing uncertainty ( as opposed to randomness ) and shared traits across groups of broadcasters . for instance , in the random broadcasters model , we can view @xmath0 as representing an assumption about the fraction of the @xmath33 broadcasters that will not participate , and the randomness as representing agnosticism regarding exactly which subset of size roughly @xmath34 will not participate ( all equally likely ) .",
    "similarly , in the random affiliates model the shared random event can be viewed as a crude proxy for the fact that affiliates of the same network share properties or traits that make them more likely to behave in unison .",
    "given any of the models above ( or any other joint probability distribution @xmath9 ) , and fixing a clearing target , we can calculate the probability that a feasible solution can be reached .",
    "to do so , we run an experiment consisting of multiple trials , each of which represents a potential outcome of the auction . in each trial , we draw from the distribution @xmath9 to make a random decision about which broadcasters will choose to participate .",
    "if a broadcaster participates in the auction , then it can be cleared .",
    "if a broadcaster does not participate , then it must be repacked .",
    "we then use picosat to determine whether it is possible to repack the set of non - participating broadcasters on the available channels , subject to the constraints . by repeating enough such trials",
    ", we can approximate the probability of success at different clearing targets .",
    "the formal description of the algorithm is given in the technical appendix in section [ sec : pico - algo ] .    before presenting the findings",
    ", we wish to emphasize that there is no special status to any of the models examined  they were chosen for their balance between capturing potential real - world assumptions about participation rates and broadcaster decision correlations , and mathematical simplicity ( e.g. having few free parameters ) .",
    "obviously all manner of hybrids of these models could be considered , as well as entirely different models accounting for potentially relevant properties of broadcasters such as geographic location , population density , industry events and views , and so on .",
    "our goal here is not to present definitive findings , but to illustrate the kinds of outcomes different models lead to .      in figure",
    "[ fig : success ] , we plot the probability of success for the first three participation models ( all without border constraints ) as a function of clearing target .",
    "one immediately evident trend is that increasing the correlation between broadcaster participation probabilities makes it more difficult to reach lower clearing targets , but easier to reach higher clearing targets . in general , the curves for the correlated models start lower but decay more gradually than for random broadcasters .",
    "thus , for any fixed value @xmath0 for the marginal probability of non - participation or repacking across the three models , the random affiliates and correlated affiliates models are more pessimistic ( less likely to clear a given target ) than the baseline random broadcasters model in the 60 - 78 mhz range ; whereas at the higher targets in the 78 - 120 mhz range , and especially for larger @xmath0 , the correlated models are more optimistic .",
    "we believe these asymmetric effects of correlation are largely due to the nature of the variance in the differing models . in the random broadcasters model , since each broadcaster decision is an independent coin flip , the fraction of broadcasters nationwide and even in broad geographic regions ( such as the highly congested northeast corridor ) will be sharply concentrated around its expectation @xmath0  there is relatively little chance of either  getting lucky \" and clearing unexpectedly large numbers of broadcasters , or `` getting unlucky '' and clearing unexpectedly small numbers of broadcasters .",
    "relative to the correlated models , the random broadcasters curves exhibit threshold behavior , in which clearing probabilities remain high for a time before dropping sharply .",
    "however , clearing the higher targets requires getting lucky , and the correlated models permit this when the correlating events or hidden variables assume values that cause much larger than average participation from affiliate broadcasters .",
    "the flip side of this is that much smaller than average participation is also possible . in statistical terms , even though the three models have the same average participation rate @xmath0 , the correlated models have much higher variance  achieving an average rate of @xmath0 by mixing cases of much higher and lower participation .",
    "one can even see this effect between the random affiliates and correlated affiliates models at @xmath35 ( red curves in figure  [ fig : success](b ) and ( c ) )  the former is more likely to clear low targets , the latter more likely to clear high targets .",
    "again , this is due to the correlated affiliates model having an additional layer of correlation , thus increasing variance .",
    "+    the sharp concentration or low variance of the random broadcasters model is highlighted by figure [ fig : threshold ] , which plots the probability of success for this model as a function of @xmath0 at the fixed target of 84 mhz .",
    "a strong threshold phenomenon can be observed , with an inflection point at around @xmath36 . at lower values of @xmath0 ,",
    "success is almost guaranteed , whereas at higher values , failure is nearly certain .",
    "figure [ fig : success - rev ] illustrates the success probabilities of the revenue model .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 controls the fraction of broadcasters whose non - participation probability is above @xmath38 , and the parameter @xmath39 controls the amount by which we amplify the non - participation probability of network affiliates . as expected , increasing either parameter reduces the probability of success . as with the random broadcasters model at larger @xmath0 , the decay in success probability is relatively rapid ; again , although now different broadcasters have different marginal probabilities of non - participation , they are still independent , yielding low variance .",
    "note that all results discussed so far ignore domain constraints .",
    "figure [ fig : indep - domain ] provides a comparison of the random broadcasters model success probabilities , both with and without domain constraints .",
    "a similar effect can be observed in all participation models .",
    "as can be seen , the probability of success is severely reduced when domain constraints are taken into account .",
    "this reduction is largely caused by the existence of broadcasters in the border regions that can only be repacked onto a few channels , if any , due to the current treaties with canada and mexico .",
    "thus , the non - participation of these broadcasters severely restricts the set of feasible solutions .",
    "note that the `` might '' experiments discussed in this section present a rather more pessimistic view of the domain constraints than the `` must '' experiments of the previous section .",
    "recall that in the `` must '' experiments , we assume that all broadcasters are willing to participate in the auction . as a result , we can assume the broadcasters in particularly tricky border regions will be cleared off the air .",
    "however , in the `` might '' experiments , we have no control over which broadcasters participate .",
    "the decisions are determined for us by a random draw from a probability distribution .",
    "thus , it is quite likely that some of the border broadcasters will end up choosing not to participate , thereby making the problem infeasible .",
    "we can also consider participation models in which we condition on the non - participation of a broadcaster or a set of broadcasters .",
    "this strategy allows us to determine the relative `` importance '' of each broadcaster .",
    "if the non - participation of a particular broadcaster has a large effect on the probability of success , then this broadcaster is in some sense more integral to the success of the auction .",
    "in particular , if broadcaster participation decisions are correlated , then by conditioning on the non - participation of a particular broadcaster , we might be more likely to believe that other broadcasters will choose not to participate as well . as a result",
    ", the probability of success will fall .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cond - corr ] , we begin with the correlated affiliates model , and condition on the non - participation of a particular affiliate . in this model , the non - participation of a single affiliate in some group @xmath40 implies that ( 1 ) that no other affiliates in group @xmath40 participate either , and ( 2 ) the `` top - level '' event happened , which means that the other affiliate groups are more likely to have complete non - participation as well . as a result ,",
    "the conditioned probabilities are significantly more pessimistic .",
    "recall that a repacking problem is feasible if , given a clearing target @xmath10 and a set @xmath24 non - participating broadcasters , all broadcasters in @xmath24 can be repacked onto the @xmath41 remaining channels .",
    "consider a set of @xmath42 broadcasters with the property that each pair @xmath43 in the set can not be repacked onto the same channel .",
    "such a set corresponds to a _",
    "clique _ in the co - channel interference graph .",
    "if all broadcasters in this set choose not to participate , then there is simply no way to repack them all onto @xmath15 channels .",
    "thus , given a clearing target @xmath10 ( or equivalently , @xmath15 available channels ) and a set @xmath24 of non - participating broadcasters , if the set @xmath24 contains any co - channel clique of size @xmath42 , we immediately know the problem is infeasible .",
    "we call such a clique a _ blocking clique_.    note that a problem can be infeasible for other reasons as well",
    ". in particular , the cause might involve the interplay of both co - channel and adjacent - channel interference constraints . however , an interesting empirical observation is that , at least when domain constraints are ignored , the most common cause of infeasibility is a blocking clique .",
    "for instance , for the random broadcasters , random affiliates , and correlated affiliates participation models discussed above , the percentage of infeasible cases that are due to the existence of a blocking clique ranges from about 75% to 85% at a 60 mhz clearing target , and increases to almost 100% for all three models at clearing targets above 90 mhz .",
    "an illustration is provided in figure [ fig : clique ] , which plots the percentage of infeasibilities due to the existence of a co - channel clique as a function of clearing target for various participation models . in all cases",
    ", the percentage is quite high .",
    "furthermore , the percentage increases with clearing target . at higher clearing targets ,",
    "smaller cliques are sufficient for causing infeasibility , which makes the event of finding such a clique more likely .",
    "this observation has algorithmic and other benefits in determining feasibility .",
    "the fact that infeasibility can usually be traced to a blocking clique allows us to bypass the use of a sat or ilp solver entirely , by simply first checking whether the set of non - participating broadcasters contains a blocking clique .",
    "we can compute a set of cliques ahead of time , so this check can be done very rapidly .",
    "a single trial with picosat takes on average 30 - 40 seconds , and can go on indefinitely if a timeout is not used .",
    "a single trial of the alternate methodology is almost instantaneous .",
    "the algorithm is described formally in the technical appendix in section [ sec : clique - algo ] .",
    "note that there might be exponentially many cliques in a graph , so finding all of them is computationally intractable .",
    "thus , we can instead use a greedy method to enumerate as many as possible . as evidence that this heuristic has near - optimal performance",
    ", we note that the percentages of infeasibilities attributed to cliques given above were indeed found via the greedy method .",
    "thus far we have been treating feasibility as binary , i.e. either our clearing target can be reached nationwide , or not .",
    "however , there are many reasons why failure can occur , and some are more severe than others . for instance , suppose we have a clearing target of 84 mhz , which leaves 24 channels open .",
    "if the set of non - participating broadcasters contains exactly one blocking clique of size 25 , then we have infeasibility . yet",
    "this infeasibility is quite weak , in the sense that if we are content to clear 78 mhz in the region containing the blocking clique , we can reach our clearing target of 84 mhz in the rest of the country . on the other hand ,",
    "if the set of non - participating broadcasters contains multiple blocking cliques across the country , then this infeasibility is more problematic .",
    "one benefit of using the clique - based methodology discussed in the previous section is that we always know the cause of failure .",
    "thus , given a clearing target and participation model , we can measure how much of the country will typically be affected by the event of infeasibility .",
    "let @xmath44 indicate the average number of broadcasters that appear in any blocking clique when infeasibility occurs .",
    "for instance , if infeasibility occurs due to the existence of a single blocking clique , then @xmath44 equals the size of that blocking clique .",
    "if infeasibility occurs due to the existence of multiple blocking clique , then @xmath44 equals the size of the union of these blocking cliques . intuitively , the larger the value of @xmath44 , the greater the fraction of the country affected , and therefore the `` worse '' the infeasibility .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zvals ] , we plot the average @xmath44 value for various clearing targets in the random broadcasters model .",
    "note that we are conditioning on the event of infeasibility ; i.e. the plots only illustrate trials in which failure occurred . in each plot , the average @xmath44 value increases as a function of both clearing target and @xmath0 .",
    "a value in the 0 - 100 range suggests that the infeasibility is quite local , and only affects a small region of the country .",
    "a value above 300 suggests that many different areas of the country are affected , though not all are significantly impaired .",
    "finally , a value above 500 indicates that the failure is both widespread and severe .",
    "the analogous figure looks numerically quite similar for the random affiliates and correlated affiliates models .    observe that @xmath44 is slightly higher in the correlated affiliates model .",
    "when failure occurs in this model , the cause is often non - participation by one or more affiliate groups , which is `` worse '' than infeasibility caused by a random draw , as in the random broadcasters model .",
    "recall from the previous section that correlations could either help or hurt success probabilities , depending on the clearing target .",
    "yet when we condition on failure and measure its extent , correlations only hurt .",
    "the dependence between participation decisions of broadcasters in various regions serves to propagate the failure across the country",
    ".     values for various clearing targets in the random broadcasters model .",
    "the average @xmath44 value increases as a function of both clearing target and @xmath0 ( i.e. as the repacking problem becomes more constrained).__,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    figure [ fig : bsets ] provides a geographic illustration of the degree of infeasibility @xmath44 at four increasingly large values of @xmath0 , and was generated by running the random broadcasters model at an 84 mhz clearing target with `` shared randomness '' , meaning that any non - participation choices made at one value of @xmath0 are carried over to the next higher value of @xmath0 . for this particular run ,",
    "at @xmath36 we have @xmath45 , and infeasibility is due to two isolated blocking cliques only .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 to @xmath46 , the value of @xmath44 climbs to @xmath47 , and the infeasibility extends to blocking cliques all over the country , including california and florida .",
    "the basic point is that even conditioning on infeasibility , there is a difference between small and large non - participation rates , in the sense that the _ extent _ of infeasibility is quantifiably worse in the latter than the former .",
    "we note that the particular blocking cliques shown are of course specific to this particular random trial , and different runs will lead to different specific problem areas .",
    "our analyses have illustrated various properties of the solution space of the repacking problem . in particular , we have determined what `` must '' happen for the problem to be feasible , and what `` might '' happen under different probabilistic participation models . in the former category ,",
    "our results highlight the effects of clearing target and domain constraints on the type , size , and diversity of solutions , at both a national and dma level . in the latter category",
    ", we examined the effects of various assumptions about broadcaster participation , namely based on network affiliate status .",
    "our hope is that the presentation of these results provides a quantitative framework in which to discuss and analyze the repacking problem . moving forward ,",

    "hidden variables _ that do not represent broadcaster decisions , but instead might represent higher - level events whose outcome could influence those decisions .    in the random affiliates model ,",
