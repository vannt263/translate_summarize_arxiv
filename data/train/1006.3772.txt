    "a whole new series of questions may be asked .",
    "the initial constraints are the radial velocity amplitude of the lighter object ( owing to the inverted mass  radius relation of wds , this object is the larger and brighter member of the system ) and the widths and depths of both transit and occultation . from this , assuming a cold c / o wd for the heavier object , @xcite were able to limit the masses and radii of both objects , but could not determine unique constraints .",
    "measurement of spectral lines from the fainter object would determine both masses uniquely , but this is challenging as the fainter object is only @xmath10% of the flux of the brighter .",
    "a number of other close wd binaries have been discovered in the last 2 years ( see table  [ tab : wd ] for those with undetermined inclinations ) .",
    "most of them , like nltt  11748 , appear to have a low - mass ( @xmath11 ) he wd in orbit with a more massive ( 0.51.0@xmath12 ) c / o wd .",

    "such constraints are invaluable in understanding the detailed formation histories and expected evolution of these systems as well as in determining the mass  radius relation from eclipse measurements .",

    ", i discuss an effect that uses precision timing of the eclipses in such double wd systems to help constrain the individual masses of the wds .",
    "this technique is known in other contexts , being common in radio pulsar systems and planetary systems @xcite , although in the latter it is largely a nuisance parameter and does not constrain the systems .",
    "i discuss its applicability to eclipsing double wd systems , the required observational precision and the resulting accuracy .",
    "in a system with a circular orbit , one often speaks of the primary and secondary eclipses as occurring exactly @xmath14 period apart , but this is not the case .",
    "if the members of the binary are of unequal mass the finite speed of light will cause an apparent shift in the phase of the secondary eclipse from @xmath15 , where @xmath5 is the period of the binary @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the shifts in eclipse timing caused by a perturbing third body on a binary system @xcite , although here one only requires two bodies and the frequency of the shift is known .    in the case of a planet with mass @xmath16 orbiting a star with mass @xmath17 , one has a primary eclipse when the planet is in front of the star .",
    "the light is blocked at time @xmath18 . however , that light was emitted earlier by the star , at time @xmath19 , since it traveled a distance @xmath20 ( the semimajor axis ) . for the secondary eclipse ,",

    "the difference of these times exceeds @xmath15 by @xmath24 , the sought - after quantity .",
    "for two finite masses , i consider two objects orbiting their center of mass with period @xmath5 , masses @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and semimajor axis @xmath20 .",
    "the total mass of the system is @xmath27 , and of course @xmath28 ; the first object orbits at a radius @xmath29 and the second object orbits at a radius @xmath30 .    near primary eclipse",
    ", the primary is at @xmath31=[2\\pi a_1",
    "t / p , a_1]$ ] and the secondary is at @xmath32 $ ] at time @xmath33 , with the observer at @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "i project the image of the two objects to the barycenter at @xmath35 .",
    "this gives @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "eclipses occur when these are equal , which has the solution @xmath38 . near secondary eclipse ,",
    "the primary is at @xmath39 $ ] and the secondary is at @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "following the same argument , eclipses occur when @xmath41 .",
    "so the eclipses differ by @xmath42 .",
    "the light - travel delay is again @xmath43 , @xmath44 reaching @xmath45 when @xmath46 , as expected . from kepler",
    "s laws the mass function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the radial velocity amplitude of object 2 , and since it is a transiting system , @xmath49 .",
    "substituting for @xmath20 and the masses , the time delay in terms of observables and the mass ratio @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 ) is : @xmath52      the eclipse duration for a circular orbit is roughly @xmath53minutes @xcite ; the duration of ingress / egress @xmath54 is decreased by a factor of @xmath55 , @xmath56s ( numerical results are for nltt  11748 ) ; and ingress / egress are sharpest at inclinations of exactly @xmath57 .",
    "the accuracy of the eclipse time determination largely depends on the duration of the ingress / egress and the total number of photons accumulated during ingress / egress , since the bottom of the eclipse is only slightly curved ( for the primary eclipse ) if not flat ( secondary eclipse ) , and one can derive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath58 where the eclipse has fractional depth @xmath59 , each observation has fractional uncertainty @xmath60 , and there are @xmath61 observations during @xmath54 .",
    "this holds in the limit that the noise is uncorrelated ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which should be true at the level discussed here ( photometric precision of @xmath7mmag ) .",
    "so , @xmath62 scales as the duration of ingress / egress divided by the total signal - to - noise ratio accumulated during that portion of the orbit . since @xmath63 for a constant observing cadence , @xmath64 . a star with @xmath65mag like nltt  11748",
    "gives roughly @xmath66 or @xmath67photons detected during a 20 s ingress / egress with a 4 m telescope . for an eclipse depth of 5% this means a precision on individual eclipse times of @xmath68s .",
    "for general binary systems , i can rewrite the expression for @xmath69  in terms of the primary mass @xmath25 , @xmath50 , and @xmath5 ( eliminating @xmath48 ) : @xmath70 for systems with primaries that are typical c / o wds and with secondaries that are he wds , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 goes from 0.5s to 7s for periods of 0.510hr ( table  [ tab : wd ] ) .",
    "eclipse depths are functions of the radii and temperatures of the wds , as well as the bandpass , and are hard to predict with any generality .",
    "the main factor that will change systematically for other double wd systems is @xmath54 itself , which is @xmath74 .",
    "this means the signal - to - noise ratio ( i.e. , detectability ) is @xmath75 , so the effect is easiest to see in long - period binaries . as the mass ratio approaches 1 the magnitude of the delay decreases , limiting its utility , but in such systems it may be easier to search for the second set of spectral lines ( depending on the temperatures of the objects ) .",
    "this effect should also be present in partially degenerate ( sdb+wd ) or non - degenerate binary systems .",
    "the precision on the eclipse times goes as @xmath76 .",
    "if the binary is wide enough that the larger star(s ) are undistorted by tides and hence the orbit remains strictly periodic , the overall detectability @xmath77 can actually increase over the double wd case i have been considering . requiring @xmath78 to minimize tidal distortions , which scale as @xmath79 , for a system with a @xmath80 m star one needs periods of @xmath81day to have tidal effects that are as small as in the double wd systems .",
    "for the ingress / egress duration the radius of the smaller object @xmath82 increases from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ( for a @xmath85 m star companion , for example ) , so if the period increases by more than a factor of 10 then the wide system is more easily detectable ( the probability of eclipse does decrease as @xmath86 , though , and both primary and secondary eclipses must be seen ) .",
    "however , the ephemeris must be known sufficiently well with tight enough limits on ( or measurements of ) eccentricity so that the light - travel delay is the only deviation from regularity ( see below ) .    for nltt  11748",
    ", i recognize that @xmath48 is the radial velocity that was measured since the heavier object is the fainter one .",
    "so , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89hr , which give @xmath90s .",
    "@xcite measured individual eclipse times to @xmath91s , making it hard to detect an effect like this . however",
    ", this was using 45 s exposures on a 2 m telescope , while the ingress / egress duration was only @xmath92s .",
    "increasing to 4 m or 8 m will improve the s / n of individual exposures by a factor of 416 , and using a cadence better matched to the orbit will help as well , driving eclipse time uncertainties to @xmath93s ( as above ) .",
    "this is sufficient to detect @xmath69 ; below i discuss how well one can measure it and what constraints one can get from it .      the above discussion considered circular orbits . for eccentricity",
    "@xmath94 the situation changes .",
    "i note that the objects in table  [ tab : wd ] have orbits that are consistent with circular orbits , although quantitative limits for @xmath95 are not always given .",
    "this follows from their expected evolutionary histories , where common - envelope evolution @xcite should have circularized orbits .",
    "nonetheless , in case our understanding of these systems is incorrect or some further evolution ( such as interaction with another body ) may have caused non - zero eccentricity , i consider the effect of a non - zero eccentricity on our detection of @xmath69 .",
    "first , there are changes to the expression for @xmath69  @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the argument of pericenter .",
    "as @xmath98 is small to begin with , this is unlikely to be significant .",
    "more important , though , is that an additional term changes the relative timing of the primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "following @xcite : @xmath99 and the primary eclipse also changes duration relative to the secondary eclipse by the ratio @xmath100 . to compare @xmath73 and",
    "@xmath101 means effectively comparing @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for @xmath104 ,",
    "this means that one is sensitive to @xmath105 ( although @xmath97 is poorly determined for low @xmath95 ) . if it can be asserted for some independent reason ( i.e. , evolutionary assumptions ) that @xmath106 then one can treat any measured @xmath107 as coming from light - travel delay .",
    "but if not one must be more careful .    fortunately , eccentricity can be constrained from the radial velocities . adopting the small-@xmath95 limit as in @xcite",
    ", @xmath108 spectra can limit the eccentricity to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the precision of the individual velocity measurements ( see also @xcite ) . with @xmath111 observations with @xmath2 precision",
    "the eccentricity can be limited ( independent of @xmath97 ) to @xmath112 , and hence can identify whether any measured time delay has a contribution from an eccentric orbit .",
    "this requires dedicated radial velocity measurements over one or more full orbits , but is achievable with current instrumentation . at this level",
    "one must also account for additional effects such as light - travel delay in the spectroscopic analysis @xcite .",
    "tidal distortions can also mimic eccentricity in radial velocity fits @xcite , but these can be identified photometrically and are expected to be quite small , @xmath113 , except in the most compact systems .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : dt ] ) gives an independent constraint on the mass ratio @xmath50 , which helps break the degeneracy in the mass function to measure the masses of the stars individually .",
    "for the individual masses @xmath114    assume that i measure @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath5 is typically known to much higher precision ) ; i also assumed @xmath117 .",
    "how well can i determine the individual masses ?",
    "i know @xmath50 to : @xmath118 i now wish to see with what precision i can estimate the masses from the observations . doing standard error propagation , @xmath119 these are the contributions of the @xmath120 and @xmath121 to the uncertainty on the mass , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "for the two terms to be comparable requires @xmath123 ( where @xmath124 is the period in hr and @xmath125 is the uncertainty on @xmath48 in @xmath126 ) . with those , i would have @xmath127 for periods @xmath128hr and mass ratios @xmath129 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath26 is similar .",
    "i illustrate this in figure  [ fig : mass ] , where i show mass constraints on nltt  11748  from hypothetical time - delay measurements .",
    "however , it is likely that the uncertainty from the radial velocity amplitude will be considerably less than that from @xmath69 : individual velocity measurements can easily have uncertainties of a few @xmath126  with a large telescope , and combining enough of them to give a meaningful constraint on the eccentricity will likewise end up with @xmath130 . getting a comparable constraint on",
    "the time delay seems implausible : with individual times measured to @xmath131s , @xmath132 eclipses are needed to get @xmath133ms , and only one time delay is measurable per orbit .",
    "this means one needs significantly higher signal - to - noise per observation than the several hundred i have been assuming here or that i will be limited by @xmath121 . in this case",
    ", the precision on @xmath25 improves as @xmath134 ; including the difficulty in detecting the delay @xmath135 , the determination of @xmath25 improves as @xmath4 .",
    "the only ways that long periods are penalized are in terms of observing strategy , as for long periods the time to get enough eclipses measured will grow long as well , and for the probability of detecting an eclipse in the first place since that decreases as @xmath136 .    as shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] , the joint probability distribution for @xmath137 is strongly correlated between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with a much stronger constraint on @xmath138 than on @xmath139",
    ". however , this would even be true  although to a lesser degree  if the other radial velocity amplitude @xmath140 were measured , especially if it were at lower precision because it is much fainter .",
    "it is straightforward although tedious to compute the linear combinations of the masses that minimize / maximize the variance which would be preferred for fitting . while not perfect , with this constraint one would have a much better picture of the system",
    "motivated by the recent discovery of nltt  11748 , the first eclipsing double wd binary , i have examined a phenomenon that affects precision eclipse timing of such a system . with knowledge of the individual masses",
    ", one can put much stronger constraints on the radii of the two wds , the evolutionary history of the system , and its expected outcome , not to mention wd atmosphere models and models for the interiors of he wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect , a delay between perfect phasing of primary and secondary eclipses , can be used to constrain the individual masses of the binary , something difficult to do otherwise .",
    "i find that the light - travel delay should be detectable in the case of nltt  11748 , and possibly in some other similar binary systems should they prove to have both primary and secondary eclipses : long periods are favored both for detecting @xmath69  and for using it to constrain the masses , although long periods do not favor detecting eclipses to begin with . the constraints on the individual masses can approach @xmath141 for plausible data - sets , and will likely be limited by the precision of the eclipse timing , suggesting that an intensive timing effort on large telescopes is worthwhile .",
    "detection of a second radial velocity amplitude would over constrain the system , leading to even tighter determinations of the masses . in",
    "non - degenerate eclipsing binaries , such as those that _",
    "kepler _ may discover , the delay should also be detectable for systems with orbital periods of greater than a few days , although it requires that the mass ratio differs from one and that no other unmodeled orbit variations be present to a high degree of confidence .",
    "the orbits of the binary members can also be perturbed by other bodies in the systems , either on shorter ( planets or other small bodies in close orbits ) or longer timescales ( a distant body ) . in both cases , perturbations in transit timing",
    "may be visible ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . given the wide variety in possible situations it is out of the scope of this letter to consider , but any perceived variation in transit timing must be compared against the possible presence of additional bodies .",
    "there could also be effects that alter the perceived primary versus secondary eclipse times without altering the orbit , such as hot spots due to irradiation @xcite or accretion . for the former ,",
    "i note that the incoming radiation in the double wd systems is typically very small , @xmath142 of the outgoing radiation .",
    "as for accretion , both wds are well inside their roche lobes and so none is expected .",
    "i find the fortunate coincidence that nltt  11748 , the one object known to be eclipsing , also has the binary parameters that lead to the highest value of @xmath69  among similar double wd binaries .",
    "hopefully , with dedicated observing this effect will be detected and can constrain the nltt  11748  system even more than is possible today .",
    "i thank the anonymous referee , as well as l.  bildsten , t.  marsh , j.  winn , e.  agol , d.  fabrycky , s.  gaudi , m.  van  adelsberg , and r.  cooper for helpful discussions .",
