    "protostellar disks dissipate over a period of several myr as their constituent dust and gas either accretes onto the star , is dispersed by processes such as stellar winds and photoevaporation , or aggregates into planetesimals ( hollenbach , yorke , & johnstone 2000 ) .",
    "possible observational examples of disk systems in the process of dissipating are the `` transitional disks '' , a thus far small class of objects which includes sources such as v819 tau ( skrutskie et al .  1990 ) , hr4796a ( jura et al .  1993 ; jayawardhana et al .  1998 ; koerner et al .  1998 ;",
    "schneider et al .",
    "1999 ; telesco et al .",
    "2000 ) and hd141569a ( weinberger et al .  1999 ;",
    "augereau et al .  1999 ; fisher et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "dramatic evidence for disk dispersal through planetesimal formation is the detection of numerous planets , and some planetary systems , around nearby stars ( marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ) .",
    "planetesimals are believed to grow into planets through collisional agglomeration .",
    "but collisions between planetesimals are also expected to create a cascade of smaller particles , and in this way a relatively old circumstellar disk may regenerate its own dust .",
    "such second generation dust was first detected around main - sequence stars by iras ( aumann et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the iras results indicated that @xmath3% of main - sequence stars possess dusty disks ( lagrange , backman , & artymowicz 2000 ) , the brightest of which have been detected at sub - millimeter wavelengths ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ; greaves et al .",
    "1998 ; sylvester , dunkin , & barlow 2001 ; see also wyatt , dent , & greaves 2003 ) .",
    "sub - millimeter observations are useful because they place strong constraints on the dust mass of the disk , due to the low optical depth of dust grains in the sub - millimeter compared to their opacities at shorter wavelengths .",
    "because of their small angular size and weak emission , only four debris disk systems have been spatially resolved at these wavelengths to date ( holland et al . 1998 ; greaves et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the maps of these systems show interesting asymmetries that have been interpreted as the dynamical signature of a planetary companion ( holland et al .",
    "2003 ; wilner et al . 2002 ; greaves et al . 1998 ) .",
    "although the majority of the well - studied debris ( and transitional ) disk systems surround early - type stars ( vega , fomalhaut , @xmath4 pic , hr4796a , and hd141569a are all a stars ) , the expectation is that the process of disk dissipation and the regeneration of dust through planetesimal collisions is also a part of the evolutionary history of lower mass stars and , indeed , our own solar system .",
    "thus , it is of considerable interest to identify debris disks associated with young solar - mass stars , since the detailed study of these objects can provide direct insight into the evolutionary history of our solar system .",
    "the @xmath5 eri system ( @xmath6 pc ) is one exciting example ( greaves et al .  1998 ; hatzes et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this _ letter _ , we present sub - millimeter observations of a dusty disk around a close solar analogue , the nearby young g2v star hd  107146 .",
    "hd  107146 was first identified as an `` excess dwarf '' on the basis of iras colors by silverstone ( 2000 ) .",
    "we observed it as part of a program to provide ground - based support for the `` formation and evolution of planetary systems '' sirtf legacy project .",
    "hd  107146 was selected for inclusion in the legacy project based on its distance ( 28.5  pc ; perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) and its high ca ii h and k index @xmath7 , which is indicative of youth . an age range can be estimated from its lithium equivalent width , 125  m  ( wichmann , schmitt , & hubrig 2003 ) , which places it at the lower envelope of the 125  myr pleiades distribution ( soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ) but above the distribution for the 250  myr old m34 ( jones et al .",
    "1997 ) at the effective temperature of a g2v star .",
    "wichmann et al .",
    "also show that its space motions are similar to the pleiades moving group .",
    "its x - ray luminosity , @xmath8  erg  s  ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) , is again similar to solar - type pleiads ( micela et al .",
    "1999 ) but weaker than that of the average solar - type stars in the 80  myr old alpha per cluster ( prosser et al .",
    "together , these indicators suggest an age for hd  107146 between 80 and 200  myr .",
    "its location in the hr diagram is also consistent with this age range but allows the possibility that it may be as young as 30  myr if the star has just reached the main sequence .",
    "our observations , made at sub - millimeter and mid - infrared wavelengths , are detailed in  2 .",
    "the results from the imaging and fits to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) are presented in  3 .",
    "the sed shows clear evidence for a large inner hole , although the hole is too small to be resolved in the sub - millimeter maps presented here . in  4",
    ", we compare the properties of the hd107146 star - disk system to other debris and transitional disk systems .",
    "we also discuss prospects for future observations that may be able to determine whether the inner hole is maintained by the dynamical effect of an unseen orbiting companion .",
    "hd  107146 was mapped using the scuba bolometer array at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii in dry , stable conditions during february 17 - 19 , 2003 .",
    "precipitable water vapor levels were less than 0.5 to 1  mm during the observations and zenith optical depths ranged from 0.1 to 0.18 at 850  and 0.4 to 0.85 at 450  .",
    "observations were made simultaneously at 450 and 850  using a 64 point `` jiggle '' pattern to produce nyquist sampled images at each wavelength .",
    "two maps were rejected in the reduction process due to an error in the telescope tracking software at high elevation ( coulson , personal communication ) .",
    "the final maps presented here are the median of 23 maps made at a range of image rotation angles on the array rebinned to a @xmath9 rectangular grid in equatorial coordinates .",
    "pointing was checked between individual maps using virgo a and 3c273 and was accurate to an rms error of @xmath10 .",
    "calibration was carried out by observing the crl 618 planetary nebula and bootstrapped to observations of mars later in the night .",
    "based on the gain variations from night to night , the calibration accuracy is estimated to be 20% at 850  and 30% at 450  .",
    "the total on source integration time was 4.0 hours and the noise in the final maps was 4 and 13  mjy  beam  at 850 and 450  respectively .",
    "the resulting peak signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath11 in both maps but the calibration uncertainty dominates the error in the absolute flux measurements .",
    "we obtained mid - ir photometry of hd  107146 from the keck  ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii using the facility instrument lws .",
    "we observed the star on february 19 and 20 , 2003  ut using filters centered at 11.7  ( 10.512.9  ) and 17.8  ( 17.318.2  ) .",
    "contemporaneously and at similar airmasses , we observed the bright standard stars @xmath12  crb and @xmath13  uma from tokunaga ( 1988 ) for photometric calibration .",
    "both nights were characterized by dry conditions with an estimated 0.51.5  mm of precipitable water , as determined from sky dip measurements from the jcmt .",
    "seeing conditions were poor and variable , leading to mid - ir images with 0.4  to 0.6  fwhm .",
    "observations were conducted in the standard `` chop / nod '' mode , which involves switching between three sky positions using fast chopping of the secondary mirror and slower nodding of the telescope itself .",
    "this allows for effective subtraction of the very bright and variable thermal emission from the sky and telescope in the reduction process .",
    "hd  107146 was well - detected in both filters , with a formal signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1415 for the 17.6  data and @xmath1450 for the 11.7  data .",
    "however , the seeing conditions limit the photometric precision , due to varying image quality from the science target to the standard stars .",
    "these conditions also prevented any useful constraints on any extended mid - ir emission from hd  107146 .",
    "photometric errors were first determined from the scatter in measurements done with apertures scaled by the fwhm of the images .",
    "we then added in quadrature an error term to account for seeing mismatch ( 10  mjy at 11.7  , 8  mjy at 17.6  ) , estimated from analyzing curve of growth photometry for standard stars observed during the course of the entire night .",
    "the absolute flux calibration is based on the flux of vega ( @xmath12  lyr ) compiled by tokunaga ( 1988 ) .",
    "the lws and scuba fluxes are listed in table  1 .",
    "the resulting maps of the emission at 450 and 850   are shown in figure  1 .",
    "there is a @xmath15 offset between the two maps , as measured by gaussian fits to the data clipped at the fwhm level .",
    "the centroid of the emission is consistent with the stellar position to within @xmath16 ( 450  ) and @xmath17 ( 850  ) .",
    "it is not clear how significant are such small offsets given the relatively low signal - to - noise in the data and the possibility of systematic pointing errors as large as @xmath10 .",
    "no other source within this angular range of the star was apparent in the digital sky survey , 2mass images , the keck imaging at 11.7 and 17.8  , and the first 20  cm survey .",
    "in addition , blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) predict @xmath18 sources degwith fluxes greater than 20  mjy at 850  , implying a probability less than @xmath19 that an unrelated background object this bright would be found within @xmath16 of the star .",
    "since the probability of unrelated submillimeter emission is very low , we assume that the scuba source is a disk associated with the star and discuss its properties in this context .    allowing for pointing errors , the resolutions of the maps are @xmath20 at 850  and @xmath21 at 450  .",
    "the gaussian fits give sizes of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( position angle @xmath24 ) respectively .",
    "the elongation at 450  is apparent at the half - power level and is therefore not due to the jcmt beam pattern which shows significant non - circularity only at the 10% level .",
    "the slight extension in the 450  map is also seen in crosscuts through the image along the major axis . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , an average crosscut over a range of position angles @xmath25 centered on the peak of emission",
    "is shown for each wavelength in the lower panels of figure  1 .",
    "the same crosscut averaging , shown as dashed lines , was performed for a map of mars , taken from the last night of observations , february @xmath26 , when the martian diameter was @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that the disk around hd  107146 is marginally resolved at the @xmath21 resolution of the 450  data . subtracting the beam size in quadrature from the gaussian fit",
    "gives an angular size of @xmath28 for the disk corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "the fluxes measured from the lws and scuba observations are listed in table  1 .",
    "the sed of the source , from optical to sub - millimeter wavelengths , is plotted in figure  2 .",
    "photometry is from landolt ( 1983 ) , the near - infrared fluxes in the _ jhk _ bands are from 2mass , and the 10  point is from palomar observations ( metchev , hillenbrand , & meyer 2003 ) . iras fluxes were determined by color correcting the quoted values in the faint source catalog .",
    "the iras 12  flux is consistent with the keck 11.7  observation and is not plotted .",
    "the stellar photosphere was fit by a kurucz model ( @xmath29 , solar metallicity ) with a power law extrapolation beyond 10  .",
    "strong excess emission is apparent beyond 25  . in order to compare the properties of the excess with that detected from other debris disk systems",
    ", we fit the disk sed using a single temperature modified black body with emission efficiency , @xmath30 $ ] , which has asymptotic behavior , @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 the critical wavelength , @xmath35 , was set to 100  for consistency with the assumptions made in previous analysis of debris disks seds ( dent et al .",
    "2000 ; wyatt , dent & greaves 2003 ) .",
    "the parameters of the modified black body fit were measured using a least squares fit to the data .",
    "errors were estimated via fits to multiple simulations of the dust excess sed .",
    "simulated data points were drawn from a gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation as determined by the observed data .",
    "the resulting distribution of best fit parameter values are @xmath36  k , @xmath37",
    ". similarly low values of @xmath4 are found for other disks around main - sequence stars ( dent et al .",
    "the dust mass , based on the fitted flux at 850  and assuming a dust mass absorption coefficient , @xmath38  @xmath39  g , is @xmath40 .",
    "this value of @xmath41 is chosen for consistency with holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and greaves et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but is on the high end of calculated values ( pollack et al . 1994 ) . for the full range of @xmath42  @xmath39  g  discussed in pollack et al .",
    ", the corresponding mass range is @xmath43 . as with all sub - millimeter observations",
    ", the inferred dust masses do not include a potentially dominant mass component that resides in larger bodies ( grains and planetesimals ) subtending a negligible solid angle .",
    "the mean parameter fit is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the single temperature fit is a simplification that is warranted by the small number of data points .",
    "nevertheless , the large dip in the sed at 25  imposes a strong limit on the mass of warmer dust that may be present in the system . to illustrate this constraint , a @xmath44  k ,",
    "@xmath45 modified black body component was added to the sed fit and increased until the iras 25  upper limit was exceeded . this maximum allowable contribution , which corresponds to a mass limit of @xmath46",
    "is shown in figure  2 but was not included in the overall fit that is shown .",
    "the keck 18  measurement tightly constrains the presence of still warmer dust to a @xmath47 limit of @xmath48 .",
    "the limits on dust cooler than 50  k are less stringent since such dust emits less per unit mass and does so at longer wavelengths .",
    "the minimum grain temperature is 23  k for blackbody particles at the measured outer radius of the disk , 150  au from the star . in practice ,",
    "the effect of a range of cool dust temperatures is indistinguishable from changes in the wavelength dependence of the grain emissivity , parameterized by @xmath4 .",
    "however , without changing the parameters of the fit in figure  2 , @xmath49 of 23  k dust can be added before the 850  @xmath47 upper limit is exceeded .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the total dust mass may reside in cooler dust .",
    "we have detected strong sub - millimeter excess emission from hd  107146 , a g2v star with an age estimated to lie in the range @xmath50  myr . based on a fit to the sed of the system",
    ", the mass of the emitting dust is estimated to be @xmath1 or larger .",
    "we also find that the disk is marginally resolved at 450  .",
    "the constraints placed by these observations on the mass , temperature , and physical extent of the dust in the system are compared in table 2 with the properties of other well - studied debris disk systems .",
    "four of the six stars in table  2 are a stars , a probable bias due to the relatively high luminosity of these systems at far - infrared and sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , despite the range in central star masses and luminosities , the disks have similar properties and follow several trends .",
    "the hd  107146 disk is quite massive , comparable in mass to the @xmath4  pic disk . although it lies noticeably above the trend of decreasing mass with age that is defined by hr4796a , @xmath4 pic , fomalhaut , and vega ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ) , it is within the scatter in the mass - age relation found for larger samples of dust disks ( wyatt et al .",
    "the fractional dust luminosity ( @xmath51 ) of hd107146 is also large ; it is half that of @xmath4 pic , @xmath52 times that of fomalhaut , and is consistent with the trend of decreasing @xmath51 with age ( spangler et al .",
    "table 2 also indicates an apparent trend of decreasing outer disk radius with age .",
    "perhaps this trend , admittedly of low statistical significance at present , will be verified when a larger number of debris disk systems have been spatially resolved .",
    "we also find that the local minimum in the sed at 25   places a strong limit on the amount of warm dust in the hd  107146 disk , @xmath53 .",
    "this lack of warm dust implies that the disk does not extend all the way to the star . the dust temperature , and therefore the size of this inner hole , depends on the grain size distribution and optical properties . for grains that emit as blackbodies at 850",
    ", 51  k dust would lie at 31  au ( wyatt et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this is a lower limit to the inner radius as smaller grains could achieve this temperature at greater distances from the star .",
    "the other disks listed in table  2 have similar size inner holes , as determined from spatially resolved images in thermal emission or scattered light , and are comparable in size to the kuiper belt in our solar system .",
    "inner holes are not , by themselves , long lasting because poynting - roberston drag will cause dust to spiral in from the outer disk onto the central star on @xmath54  myr timescales . such inward migration would be evident in the sed by the presence of warm dust ( jura et al .",
    "thus , the existence of inner holes has been explained as a consequence of either the dynamical sweeping of an orbiting companion ( e.g. , vega ; wilner et al .",
    "2002 ) or the sublimation of icy grains ( e.g. , hr  4796a ; jura et al .",
    "1998 ) . since water ice sublimates at temperatures greater than 100  k ( pollack et al . 1994 ) , this explanation can not apply to the hd  107146 disk where the shape of the sed places a strong limit on the mass of such warm dust .",
    "the alternative explanation , that the inner hole is dynamically maintained by a closely orbiting companion , would require a fairly low - mass companion .",
    "the best current limit on the existence of close companions is from palomar adaptive optics imaging by metchev & hillenbrand ( 2002 ) who found no companions at detection limits of 11.2 , 11.7 , and 15.2 in absolute k band magnitude at angular separations of @xmath55 , and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the corresponding mass limits for an age of 100 myr are approximately 30 , 25 , and @xmath57 ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) .    while it has been well - recognized that the dynamical sculpting of disks by orbiting companions can produce inner holes and ring - like structures , recent studies have shown that the migration of dust in the presence of a residual gas disk can also induce ring - like structures in the dust distribution .",
    "for example , takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) have shown that the dust structures seen in the hr4796a and hd141569a systems are qualitatively similar to those expected to result from the coupling between gas and dust in disks . however , orbiting companions may also induce significant departures from axisymmetry in the dust distribution ( e.g. , liou & zook 1999 ; ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 ; quillen & thorndike 2002 ; moro - martin & malhotra 2002 ) , whereas such non - axisymmetric structures can not be produced by dust migration .",
    "thus , demonstrating the existence of asymmetries in the dust distribution , either in thermal emission or scattered light , as well as measuring the gas content of the hd107146 disk , is needed to distinguish between these two possibilities .    at a distance of 28.5  pc , hd  107146",
    "is relatively nearby .",
    "compared to the other sources listed in table  2 , it is more distant than the debris disk systems that have been spatially resolved at submillimeter wavelengths ( @xmath4 pic , vega , fomalhaut , and @xmath5 eri ) , but it is at half the distance of hr4796a . since the hd  107146 disk is just resolved at the shortest operating wavelength of scuba , and the submillimeter excess is relatively bright , the submillimeter array should be able to map the morphology of the emitting dust in greater detail .",
    "phase referencing will provide a more accurate absolute position , and such observations could determine whether the dust is distributed axisymmetrically ( e.g. , in a ring ) or in a more asymmetric distribution .",
    "for example , these observations may confirm the marginal evidence for an offset between the stellar position and the peak of the @xmath58 emission found in the observations presented here ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the offset , if real , may result from an asymmetric dust distribution , as has been found for several of the other debris disk systems in table 2 .",
    "the dust disk asymmetry can also be addressed by imaging the disk in scattered light .",
    "the possibility of detecting scattered light from vega - like stars is of great interest given the few such systems that have been detected thus far , despite extensive deep surveys ( e.g. , kalas & jewitt 1996 ) . using the quantities listed in table  2",
    ", we can make a rough estimate of the relative strengths of the scattered light from each disk .",
    "if we ignore the disk inclination and assume a similar dust grain size distribution and albedo , the scattering area will be proprtional to @xmath59 and the flux of scattered light will be roughly proportional to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the distance to the star and @xmath62 is the physical extent of the disk .",
    "the factor of @xmath63 arises in this expression because grains of a given size located farther from the star intercept less starlight .",
    "hence the surface brightness of the disk will be proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "a potentially more relevant comparison is of the contrast between the expected surface brightness from the disk and the flux from the star , which is proportional to @xmath65 ( cf .",
    "jura et al .",
    "for the disk around hd107146 , the expected surface brightness of the scattered light is one half that of the disk around @xmath4 pic and the expected contrast is nine times larger , suggesting that the scattered light from hd107146 may not only be quite bright but may also stand out against the glare of the star . given the low dust temperature deduced for the hd107146 disk ( @xmath66k ) , the grains are expected to be icy with a high albedo , which favors the detection of scattered light .",
    "nevertheless , there are significant uncertainties associated with this estimate . detecting reflected light will be more challenging if the disk is face - on rather than edge - on .",
    "in addition , the sub - millimeter measurements from which @xmath59 is derived are primarily sensitive to large grains ( @xmath67 ) , whereas the scattered light observations will be particularly sensitive to much smaller grain sizes .",
    "thus , scattered light from the hd107146 disk will be weaker if the grain size distribution is significantly skewed to large grain sizes .",
    "conversely , scattered light measurements can help to constrain the grain size distribution of the disk ( e.g. , artymowicz , burrows , & paresce 1989 ) .",
    "future spectroscopic observations of this disk with sirtf , particularly in the @xmath68  range , will place additional constraints on the grain composition and size distribution ( e.g. wolf & hillenbrand 2003 ) .",
    "sirtf is also expected to discover many more disks over a large range of ages and stellar masses with consequent improvements for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
