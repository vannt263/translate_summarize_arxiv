    "an array of recent millimetre and sub - millimetre ( submm ) observations revealed the physical properties of sub - millimetre bright galaxies ( smgs ) with luminosities @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the power sources of such luminous smgs are thought to be very active star formation with @xmath8 and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "ultra - violet photons from massive stars or agns are converted to photons in submm to infrared bands by dust grains via their thermal emission .",
    "@xcite find that , in the chandra deep field north survey , x - rays are detected from more than one - third of bright smgs , which indicates a significant contribution from agns .",
    "smgs provide important information on the star formation rate , the stellar initial mass function , and the chemical evolution of the galaxies at high redshifts . because smgs are highly obscured by dust , they often appear dark in uv and optical wavebands . thus measuring their redshifts by conventional techniques",
    "is very difficult .",
    "moreover , identifying the optical counterpart is not easy because the spatial resolution of the currently operating submm telescopes is much worse than that of large optical telescopes .",
    "so far , most of the smgs with measured redshifts are at @xmath9 @xcite , but a few smgs have been found at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "smgs generally show strong clustering @xcite . @xcite",
    "measured the angular correlation of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 selected smgs in the herschel - atlas survey .",
    "the smgs are strongly clustered while the @xmath12 selected sample showed weak or no clustering signals .",
    "it is thought that smgs are very massive systems with large gas reservoir ( @xmath13 ) and with large stellar masses ( @xmath13 ) @xcite . also , smgs are likely to be ancestors of massive elliptical galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that the redshift distribution of smgs shows a peak at @xmath4 , similarly to that of agns , although the size of the sample is small .",
    "several smgs have counterparts of star - forming galaxies such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and lyman @xmath3 emitters ( laes ) @xcite .",
    "however , many of high - redshift galaxies are not seen as smgs probably because their submm fluxes are below typical observational flux limits ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "because observations so far detect very bright smgs , it remains unclear if smgs are generally associated with lbgs / laes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite failed to detect submm sources at the location of laes in a protocluster region even though the target galaxies are very bright in ly@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite use cosmological simulations and found that the submm fluxes of high-@xmath15 laes would be less than @xmath16 .",

    "they show that the simulated galaxy in a very early lae phase can be detected by alma .",
    "observing galaxies in the early formation phase is important to understand the early chemical evolution .",
    "one of the most important observational quantities is the source number count of smgs@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there remain substantial uncertainties in theoretical models .",
    "@xcite calculate the source number count of smgs using a semi - analytic galaxy formation model .",
    "interestingly , in order to reproduce the observed source number count , they make a crucial assumption that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is top - heavy when starburst occurs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite reproduced the source number count of smgs without assuming top - heavy imf .",
    "they argue that the major difference between @xcite and their study may be in the gas cooling model . in @xcite , the hot gas in a galaxy",
    "is assumed to cool more efficiently than in @xcite . however , because of the efficient cooling , the model of @xcite overproduces massive galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "it appears that some efficient star - formation recipe is needed in the semi - analytic models , in order to reproduce the source number count of smgs .",
    "it is interesting to see if the same is true for cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite study the physical properties of smgs using cosmological simulations .",
    "they claim that smooth infalling gas or / and gas - rich satellites are important to produce large star formation rates .",
    "although their finding seems reasonable , they employ a simple model that galaxies with very large star - formation rates are identified as smgs",
    ". they do not calculate dust absorption and the resulting submm flux .",
    "it is important and timely to study in detail the statistical properties of smgs over a wide range of redshift using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by considering dust absorption and re - emission consistently .    in this paper",
    ", we study the statistical properties of smgs such as the stellar mass function , the source number count and the angular correlation function . to this end",
    ", we perform large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations based on the standard @xmath17cdm cosmology .",
    "our simulations follow star formation , supernova feedback , and metal enrichment self - consistently . for the galaxies identified in our cosmological simulations ,",
    "we calculate the spectral evolution and dust extinction to estimate the fir luminosity . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we used the same set of simulations to study the statistical properties of laes at @xmath18 .",
    "our model successfully reproduced all the available observational data at @xmath18 such as the lyman-@xmath3 luminosity function , the angular correlation functions , and the lyman-@xmath3 equivalent width distribution .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to build a consistent theoretical model of galaxy formation that reproduces the observed properties of both ultra - violet selected galaxies and smgs .    throughout the present paper ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath17cdm cosmology with the matter density @xmath19 , the cosmological constant @xmath20 , the hubble constant @xmath21 in units of @xmath22 and the baryon density @xmath23 .",
    "the matter density fluctuations are normalised by setting @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system , and the ly@xmath3 ew@xmath25 values in this paper are in the rest frame .",
    "our simulation code is based on an updated version of the tree - pm smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 which is a successor of tree - pm sph code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "we employ @xmath26 particles in a comoving volume of 100 @xmath27 on a side .",
    "the mass of a dark matter particle is @xmath28 and that of a gas particle is @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we implement relevant physical processes such as star formation , supernova feedback and chemical enrichment following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , two wind models for supernova ( sn )",
    "feedback are examined .",
    "one model assumes that the initial wind speed of gas around stellar particles that trigger sn is proportional to the local velocity dispersion of dark matter ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the model is motivated by recent observations of @xcite .",
    "the other model assumes a constant initial wind speed , as has been used in many cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the major difference between the two models is the wind mass - loading per star formation rate . in the former model ,",
    "the mass - loading is proportional to @xmath31 whereas it is constant for all galaxies in the latter model .",
    "@xcite show that the former model reproduce the observed satellite luminosity function and the luminosity - metallicity relation in the local group satellites .",
    "we set the initial wind speed of gas to be five times the local velocity dispersion , following @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the statistical properties of uv - selected galaxies .",
    "we implemented wavelength dependent dust absorption to calculate the uv and lyman-@xmath3 luminosities of the galaxies . in the present paper , in order to calculate the fir luminosity , we assume that the absorbed uv photons are re - emitted in fir by thermal dust grains .      the treatment of dust absorption is described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we calculate the optical depth @xmath32 for uv continuum photons on the assumption that dust is distributed in a sphere with a certain radius around a galaxy",
    ". then we use only one length scale , the effective radius of dust distribution @xmath33 , to evaluate the optical depth .",

    "we use the dust optical constant @xmath38 as a function of wavelength given in @xcite , so that we obtain realistic seds for individual galaxies .",
    "we set @xmath39 and @xmath40 for dust grains that are produced by supernovae @xcite . in this case , the resulting extinction curve is flatter than the smc extinction curve and the calzetti extinction curve , because @xmath38 for large grains is nearly independent of wavelength @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , recent observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies at @xmath41 suggest that the extinction curve is flatter than the calzetti extinction curve @xcite . furthermore , the extinction curve for the sn - produced dust size distribution reproduces the observation well @xcite .",
    "although our single - sized dust model might seem crude , the resulting extinction curve does not significantly affect our main results presented in the paper . in section 4 ,",
    "we explicitly show that adopting the steep smc extinction curve yields virtually the same statistical quantities for the smg population .    we calculate the dust surface mass density as @xmath37 where @xmath42 and @xmath33 are the dust mass and the effective dust distribution radius of each simulated galaxy , respectively .",
    "the dust mass is calculated by @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the gas mass , the gas metallicity and the solar metallicity , respectively @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath47 , and then the above equation gives @xmath48 for @xmath49 , which means that one percent ( in mass ) of the gas in a simulated galaxy with @xmath49 is locked in dust grains .",
    "hence the dust mass scales with the gas metallicity .",
    "we assume that the effective dust distribution radius of a galaxy @xmath33 is a fraction of its virial radius , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a global parameter to be kept constant for all the galaxies",

    "the above integration is evaluated over from uv to optical wavelengths . in the next subsection",
    ", we describe the calculation of the fir flux .",
    "we calculate the fir flux following @xcite . for the single - sized dust model ,",

    "we have seen in previous sections ( fig .",

    "we argue that the kind of strong feedback , in terms of star formation efficiency , may be needed for viable galaxy formation models , in order for them to reproduce all the available data from low to high redshifts .",
    "constructing such a perfect model is the ultimate goal of the study of galaxy formation , but it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "further studies on the efficiency of star formation in galaxies are clearly needed using multiple approaches .    together with our previous study on lyman-@xmath3 emitters at @xmath18@xcite",
    ", we now provide a unified galaxy population model within the standard @xmath17 cold dark matter cosmology , which reproduces simultaneously the statistical properties of uv - selected star - forming galaxies and sub - millimetre galaxies at high redshifts .",

    "is would like to thank b. hatsukade , y. tamura , t. nozawa , k. nagamine and m. kobayashi for stimulating discussion .",
