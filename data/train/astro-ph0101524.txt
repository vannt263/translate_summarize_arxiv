    "the parameter space of neutrino mass - squared difference and vacuum mixing angle are constrained differently @xcite .",

    "although these mass models have been proposed to account for the existing neutrino anomalies , many of them already contain or can be easily be extended to contain additional singlet states which also mix with active neutrinos .",
    "as long as the new particles are sufficiently massive and have sufficiently small mixings with active neutrinos , they evade terrestrial constraints , and it is interesting and useful to speculate on their cosmological and astrophysical consequences . as we show later in this paper ,",
    "even apparently negligible active - sterile neutrino mixing is sufficient to induce the production of sterile neutrino dark matter in the early universe .",
    "a specific model s viability in producing a sterile neutrino dark matter candidate depends on whether the mass and mixing properties of the candidate(s ) with the active neutrinos lie within the range that produces an appropriate amount of dark matter , and whether the candidate is stable over the lifetime of the universe , does not engender conflicts with observationally - inferred primordial light element abundances , does not violate cmb bounds , and does not contribute excessively to the debra in photons @xcite .",

    "the sterile neutrinos can contribute significantly to the energy density and pressure . approximating all species other than the sterile neutrino to be relativistic , we have @xmath454 , where @xmath455 and @xmath456 are the energy and pressure in all particles other that the sterile neutrinos / antineutrinos",
    ". therefore , @xmath457 the rate of change of the standard energy density is straightforward : @xmath458 the temperature derivative of the sterile neutrino energy density is @xmath459^{1/2 } p^2dp}\\nonumber\\\\   & - & \\frac{m_s^2}{2\\pi^2 } \\int{\\left[f_{\\nu_s}(p)+ f_{\\bar\\nu_s}(p)\\right ] \\left[(p^2+m_s^2)/t^2\\right]^{-1/2 } p^2 dp}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this , together with the energy density and pressure in the sterile neutrinos and antineutrinos calculated from their time - dependent distribution functions , allows one to readily arrive at a consistent time - temperature evolution .",

    "<S> we calculate the incoherent resonant and non - resonant scattering production of sterile neutrinos in the early universe . we find ranges of sterile neutrino masses , vacuum mixing angles , and initial lepton numbers which allow these species to constitute viable hot , warm , and cold dark matter ( hdm , wdm , cdm ) candidates which meet observational constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints considered here include energy loss in core collapse supernovae , energy density limits at big bang nucleosynthesis , and those stemming from sterile neutrino decay : limits from observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies , diffuse extragalactic background radiation , and @xmath0li / d overproduction . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations explicitly include matter effects , both effective mixing angle suppression and enhancement ( msw resonance ) , as well as quantum damping . </S>",
    "<S> we for the first time properly include all finite temperature effects , dilution resulting from the annihilation or disappearance of relativistic degrees of freedom , and the scattering - rate - enhancing effects of particle - antiparticle pairs ( muons , tauons , quarks ) at high temperature in the early universe . </S>"
