    "we note that @xmath11 is equivalent to two copies of the massive dirac hamiltonian but with a @xmath12-dependent mass @xmath9.@xcite in this system , the transition of electronic band structure occurs from a normal to an inverted type when the thickness of the quantum well is varied through a critical thickness .",
    "this corresponds to the sign change of the mass @xmath7 of this system.@xcite it should be noted that since @xmath13 ( which corresponds to the fact that chirality is different for different spins ) , spin orbit coupling has @xmath14 component , which results in spin rotation effect .    by solving scattering problem in this junction with the use of the hamiltonian eq.([conth ] ) , one can calculate the rotation angle of the spin of the electron within the plane @xmath15 .",

    "a similar problem in 3d tis has been also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .      next ,",
    "let us proceed to 3d tis coupled to ferromagnets .",
    "we consider 2d ferromagnet / ferromagnet junctions which is abbreviated as f1/f2 in the following .",
    "we focus on charge transport at the fermi level inside the bulk gap of the ti , which is described by the 2d massive dirac hamiltonian @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are exchange field and we set @xmath39 . here",
    ", @xmath40-axis points to the interface normal while @xmath41-axis is parallel to the interface .",
    "we choose the exchange field in the f1 side as @xmath42 @xmath43 while in the f2 side , we set @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    by using the landauer formula , one can calculate the tunneling conductance of the junction .",
    "@xcite below , ",
    "n \" and  p \" mean that the fermi level crosses the upper and the lower bands , respectively    figure [ fig2c ] depicts the normalized tunneling conductance @xmath46 in n - n junction for ( a ) @xmath47 and ( b ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fermi energy . in fig . [ fig2c ] ( a ) , the f2 is no longer ferromagnetic .",
    "however , the conductance strongly depends on the direction of the magnetization in the f1 . at @xmath50 or @xmath33 ,",
    "the mismatch of the wavefunctions between the two sides and that of the sizes of the fermi surfaces suppress the conductance , because the energy @xmath49 is near the bottom of the upper band in f1 while there is no gap in f2 . at @xmath51 , on the other hand , the wavefunctions and the sizes of the fermi surfaces are the same on both sides except the shift of fermi surface in the momentum space due to the in - plane component of the magnetization",
    ". however , this misfit of the in - plane momentum between the two sides leads to a strong dependence of @xmath46 on the in - plane rotation angle @xmath52 , which is not seen in the conventional magnetoresistance effect .",
    "since @xmath53 is conserved due to the translational symmetry along @xmath41-axis , the positions of the fermi surfaces strongly affect the charge transport : if exchange field points to @xmath40-axis , there is no evanescent wave . on the other hand , when exchange field is applied in @xmath41-direction",
    ", the fermi surface moves to the @xmath53 direction and hence the overlap region between @xmath53 s in the f1 and f2 is reduced .",
    "therefore , the number of the evanescent modes increases and hence the conductance is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus , we can obtain _ giant _ magnetoresistance in this system . in fig .",
    "[ fig2c ] ( b ) , the conductance is large at the parallel configuration ( @xmath50 ) while it is small for antiparallel configuration ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "[ fig2c ] ( d ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2c ] ( d ) , in stark contrast to the conventional magnetoresistance effect , the conductance takes minimum at the parallel configuration ( @xmath50 ) while it takes maximum near antiparallel configuration ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these @xmath26 dependences can be understood by the overlap intergral of the wavefunctions on both sides.@xcite      up to here , we have considered tis with static magnetizations .",
    "we next consider dynamical magnetizations . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of magnetization coupled to the surface dirac fermions of a 3d ti has been investigated by deriving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in the presence of charge current .",
    "it is shown that both the inverse spin - galvanic effect and the gilbert damping coefficient are related to the two - dimensional diagonal conductivity of the dirac fermion , while the berry phase of the ferromagnetic moment is related to the hall conductivity .",
    "the derived landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation has complicated torque terms , reflecting the spin structure of the surface dirac fermion .",
    "anomalous behaviors in various phenomena , e.g. , the ferromagnetic resonance , are predicted in terms of this landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in ref.@xcite .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence between the direction of momentum and that of the spin on the surface of the ti , an injected charge current can induce the magnetization , which is the so - called inverse spin - galvanic effect.@xcite the emergence of the inverse spin - galvanic effect is a direct consequence of the fact that , on the surface of ti , the velocity operator is given by the pauli matrices in spin space .",
    "the current - induced magnetization on the surface exerts torque on the magnetization of the ferromagnet when they are noncollinear .",
    "therefore , by injecting an electric current on the surface of the ti , one obtains spin transfer torque between the surface dirac fermion and the magnetization .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", dynamics of the magnetization coupled to the surface dirac fermions of a 3d ti has been studied by numerically solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in the presence of charge current .",
    "the current - induced magnetization dynamics and the possibility of magnetization reversal have been discussed .",
    "figure [ fig2d ] shows an example of current - induced magnetization reversal from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "since the magnetization dynamics is a direct manifestation of the inverse spin - galvanic effect , another ferromagnet is unnecessary to induce spin transfer torque in contrast to the conventional setup composed of two ferromagnets.@xcite    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a current dynamics on the surface state of a 3d ti induced by an exchange field of an attached ferromagnet has been discussed .",
    "it is found that the magnetic precession generates a direct charge current when the precession axis is within the surface plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2e ] .",
    "this rectification effect is due to a quantum anomaly and is topologically protected .",
    "intuitively , this phenomenon may be explained by an analogy to the quantum hall effect : the exchange field perpendicular to the surface of ti plays a role of a magnetic field in the quantum hall effect while that parallel to the surface corresponds to an applied inplane electric field .",
    "when the sign of the perpendicular exchange field changes , then that of the velocity of the parallel exchange field also changes .",
    "therefore , simultaneous sign change of the magnetic field and the applied electric field does not change the sign of the hall current : the rectification effect . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar rectification effect has been studied on an edge state of two - dimensional tis induced by a circularly polarized light .",
    "optical effects of a ti have been studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite . due to the inverse faraday effect@xcite",
    ", spin polarization can be induced on the surface of ti by a circularly polarized light . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin polarization of the electrons on the surface of tis under a circularly polarized light has been investigated .",
    "it is predicted that a light illumination can induce the out - of - plane component of the spin polarization as a result of the inverse faraday effect .",
    "the magnitude of the spin polarization is proportional to the square of the lifetime @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 for typical parameters .",
    "because the surface states of tis are spin - filtered , they are expected to show novel charge transport which can not be realized in other systems .",
    "we note that the linear dispersion of the dirac cone on the surface of the ti is similar to photons , and the velocity of the dirac cone on the surface of 3d ti depends on materials : about @xmath60 m/s for bi@xmath61te@xmath62 @xcite , and @xmath63 m / s for bi@xmath61se@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , when two different tis are attached , the refraction phenomenon similar to optics is expected at the junction .",
    "the effective dirac hamiltonian of the surface states on the @xmath64-plane is represented as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath67 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this hamiltonian has the linear dispersion @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the wavenumber .",
    "from this hamiltonian we can easily see that for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , the spin on the fermi surface on the upper cone has the clockwise ( counterclockwise ) direction in @xmath72 space .",
    "hence the sign of @xmath67 corresponds to the spin chirality in @xmath72 space . in ref .",

    "@xcite , nernst - ettingshausen and thermal hall effects have been investigated on the surface of a ti on which a ferromagnet is attached .",
    "general expressions of the peltier and the thermal hall conductivities are derived , which are reduced to simple forms at low temperatures .",

    "the peltier conductivity can be used to map the berry phase structure .",
    "the edge states in 2d tis have perfectly conducting channels like quantum hall edge states .",
    "it is therefore expected to show anomalous thermoelectric transport as well . in ref .",
