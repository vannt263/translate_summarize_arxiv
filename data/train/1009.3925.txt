    "a classical nova is the consequence of thermonuclear runaway on the surface of a white - dwarf star that is accreting hydrogen - rich material from its partner in a binary system .",
    "such novae are ideal sites for the study of explosive nucleosynthesis because the observational  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite , and nuclear - experimental  @xcite aspects of their study are each fairly advanced . in particular , due to the relatively low peak temperatures in nova outbursts ( @xmath5 gk ) , most of the nuclear reactions involved are not too far from the valley of beta stability to be studied in the laboratory , and the corresponding thermonuclear reaction rates are mostly based on experimental information  @xcite .",
    "an example of a gamma - ray emitter produced in novae is @xmath6al ( t@xmath7 @xmath2 @xmath8 years , @xmath9 = 1.809 mev ) .",
    "indeed , this isotope has been observed in the galaxy  @xcite , but its long half life precludes the identification of its progenitor , and novae are only expected to make a secondary contribution to its galactic abundance  @xcite .",
    "other gamma - ray emitters can provide more direct constraints on nova models  @xcite .",
    "an example is @xmath0na ( t@xmath7 = 2.603 years , @xmath9 = 1.275 mev ) , which has not yet been observed in the galaxy .",
    "unlike @xmath6al , the relatively short half life of @xmath0na restricts it to be localized near its production site .",
    "novae also could be the principal galactic sites for the production of @xmath0na , making @xmath0na an excellent nova tracer .",
    "an observational upper limit of @xmath10 m@xmath11 was set on the @xmath0na mass in one nova ejecta with the comptel telescope onboard the cgro  @xcite .",
    "currently , the maximum @xmath0na mass ejected using one nova models is an order of magnitude below this limit  @xcite and corresponds to a maximum detection distance of 500 parsecs using an observation time of @xmath12 s with the spectrometer spi onboard the currently - deployed integral mission  @xcite .",
    "this suggests we are now on the verge of being able to detect this signal .",
    "in addition , ne isotopic ratios in some meteoritic presolar graphite grains imply the _ in - situ _ decay of @xmath0na produced by nucleosynthesis in novae  @xcite and/or supernovae  @xcite .",
    "it is important to reduce uncertainties in the rates of key reactions that are expected to affect the production of @xmath0na so that accurate comparisons can be made between observations and models  @xcite .",
    "for example , the production of @xmath0na in novae depends strongly on the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath0na(@xmath1 mg reaction  @xcite , which consumes @xmath0na .",
    "the thermonuclear @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) reaction rate in novae is dominated by narrow , isolated resonances with laboratory proton energies @xmath14 kev .",
    "consequently , the rate is dependent on the energies and strengths of these resonances , which have been investigated both indirectly and directly in the past .",
    "indirect information on potential @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) resonances has been derived from measurements of the @xmath15mg(@xmath16 )  @xcite , @xmath17mg(@xmath18 )  @xcite , and @xmath0na(@xmath19he,@xmath20 )  @xcite reactions , and from the beta - delayed proton- and gamma - decays of @xmath21al  @xcite . the first published attempt to measure the @xmath0na(@xmath13 )",

    "@xcite in the range @xmath22 kev by seuthe _",
    "et al . _ employed ion - implanted @xmath0na targets  @xcite , resulting in the first direct observation of resonances and the only absolute measurement of resonance strengths .",
    "later , stegmller _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discovered a new resonance at 213 kev and determined its strength relative to the strengths from ref .",
    "more recently , a new level in @xmath21 mg ( @xmath23 = 7770 kev ) has been discovered using the @xmath24c(@xmath24c,@xmath25 )  @xcite reaction .",
    "this level corresponds to a @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) laboratory proton energy of 198 kev , and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed that this potential resonance could dominate the @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) reaction rate at nova temperatures .",
    "we have measured the energies , strengths , and branches of known resonances  @xcite and searched for proposed resonances  @xcite in the energy range @xmath3 @xmath2 195 to 630 kev .",
    "the measurements were performed at the center for experimental nuclear physics and astrophysics of the university of washington with ion - implanted @xmath0na targets prepared at triumf - isac . thanks to evaporated protective layers",
    "@xcite , the targets exhibited little to no degradation over @xmath2 20 c of bombardment . using mainly the strengths and energies obtained in this work together with supplemental information from other work  @xcite , we have re - evaluated the thermonuclear reaction rate of @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) , and full hydrodynamic simulations have been performed to estimate the effect of the new rate on the flux of @xmath0na from novae . this article is a detailed presentation of our experiment , its results , and their implications , complementing our previous reports  @xcite .",
    "we measured @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) resonances directly by bombarding implanted @xmath0na targets with protons from a tandem van de graaff accelerator .",
    "high currents ( @xmath2 45 @xmath26a ) at lab energies ranging from 150 to 700 kev were achieved with a terminal ion source .",
    "the number of reactions , @xmath27 , produced by a beam of incident particles with areal density @xmath28 on a target with areal density @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the cross section .",
    "conventional methods employ a small - diameter beam that impinges on a large - area target , where the target density is nearly uniform .",
    "however , this technique can lead to target damage in cases where large beam currents are used , and there is a long history of differing results on resonance strengths that have been attributed to target instabilities  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where the beam was swept over an area larger than the full extent of the target with a rastering device . in the limit of uniform beam density over the target area , eq .",
    "[ first ] becomes    @xmath32    this method requires knowledge of only the _ total _ number of target atoms and , thus , is not very sensitive to target non - uniformities . on the other hand , this method also requires a determination of the beam density .",
    "the yield is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a beam density normalized to the accumulated charge , @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , we determined the _ integrated yield _ of the excitation function over the beam energy , minimizing uncertainties associated with the energy loss in the target and beam energy distribution , which can be substantial in determinations using only the yield at a particular energy .",
    "the latter method , which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , depends on knowing the energy loss in the target , the target stochiometry and uniformity , and often assumes stable target conditions , which are unlikely in experiments with currents of tens of microamps , such as ours .",

    "our @xmath0na targets were produced by ion implantation , which yields isotopically pure targets and avoids complications with chemical fabrication .",
    "each target was made at triumf - isac by implanting a 10-na , 30-kev @xmath0na@xmath43 ion beam into a rectangular ofhc copper substrate with dimensions 3 mm @xmath44 19 mm @xmath44 25 mm .",
    "the beam was rastered over a 5-mm collimator such that at the raster extreme only 5% of the beam remained on target , thereby creating a nearly uniform density .",
    "the setup included electron suppression with @xmath45 v and a liquid nitrogen - cooled cold trap with a vacuum pressure in the range of @xmath46 to @xmath47 torr .",
    "charge integration was monitored throughout the implantation process , which took roughly 24 hours per target with a peak @xmath0na current of @xmath48 na .",
    "initially , two test targets , # 1 and # 2 , were implanted with activities of @xmath2 300 and 185 @xmath26ci , respectively . as target degradation",
    "can be quite problematic , we carried out a program  @xcite to determine the ideal combination of implantation energy , substrate , and possible protective layer by bombarding @xmath21na targets implanted under similar conditions . using the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , two additional @xmath2 300 @xmath26ci @xmath0na targets , # 3 and # 4 , were implanted with the same parameters but included a 20-nm protective layer of chromium , deposited by vacuum evaporation after implantation .",
    "a small rise in temperature of the target was observed during the evaporation ; however , a survey of the apparatus showed no residual activity from diffusion of @xmath0na out of the target .",
    "all @xmath0na data presented were taken on the chromium - covered targets , with the exception of the 232-kev resonance measurement that employed target # 1 .    to explore the transverse location of the implanted @xmath0na , the beta activity was scanned with a geiger counter behind a 6-mm thick brass shield .",
    "a 3-mm diameter hole in the center allowed transmission of the beta particles .",
    "this measurement confirmed that the @xmath0na was confined within a 5-mm diameter circle and determined the position of the activity relative to the center of the substrate .",
    "although this method was not very sensitive to radially - dependent non - uniformity , it did verify axial symmetry .",
    "thanks to this information and the extreme rastering of the @xmath0na beam , we believe the targets were quite uniform , although our method does not require this .      figs .  [ chamber ] and  [ setup ] illustrate our chamber and detector system , respectively .",
    "the main features of the chamber included its dual liquid - nitrogen cooled cold shroud system , three collimators , and water - cooled target mount .",
    "the cold shroud isolated the radioactive target to prevent the contamination of the upstream beamline with @xmath0na and also helped maintain a clean environment near the target , suppressing carbon buildup . during data collection , the pressure in the chamber was in the range of ( 1 - 2)@xmath49 torr .",
    "the end of the downstream cold shroud surrounded our target substrate ; however , because it was the farthest away from the liquid - nitrogen cold trap , it only reached a temperature of 125 k , whereas the upstream shroud reached 88 k.    the chamber had three sets of collimators .",
    "the first , collimator 1 , was a water - cooled , sliding ladder between the cold shrouds with 4- , 7- , and 8-mm diameter collimators .",
    "the 8-mm collimator was used during @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) data acquisition . also on this ladder",
    "were electron - suppressed 1-mm and 3-mm diameter collimators with downstream beam stops for tuning .",
    "collimator 2 , an 8-mm collimator , was 33 mm downstream of the ladder and was attached to the end of the downstream cold shroud .",
    "it was followed by a 10-mm diameter cleanup collimator , collimator 3 , located 122 mm farther downstream .",
    "each collimator was electrically isolated from the chamber to permit current monitoring .",
    "the target substrate was bolted to a copper backing flange and was directly cooled with deionized - water via a thin pipe coupled to the flange . to minimize handling time in proximity to the radioactive targets , this assembly",
    "was then attached to a stainless steel coupler with a iso flange on the chamber side .",
    "directly upstream of this assembly was a 30-mm long electron suppressor biased between @xmath50 and @xmath45 v. during data collection , the current on target was monitored , and the charge was integrated and recorded .",
    "two sets of detector systems were positioned at @xmath51 55@xmath52 to the beam axis .",
    "a top view of the setup , including chamber , shielding , detectors , and dewars , is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "each system consisted of a high - purity 100% germanium ( hpge ) crystal canberra model gr10024 encased in cosmic - ray anticoincidence shielding .",
    "the detector angle was chosen to minimize effects due to angular anisotropy , as the legendre polynomial @xmath53 is zero at @xmath51 55@xmath52 .",
    "the resolutions for each detector at 1.275 mev were 4.4 kev and 7.4 kev ( fwhm ) with high rates ( @xmath0na target present ) , and 2.2 kev and 3.0 kev ( fwhm ) with low rates ( using residual @xmath0na activity with @xmath0na target removed ) .",
    "in addition , because of the target radioactivity , 26 mm of lead shielding was placed between the target and detector system to reduce the event rate in the detectors to a few tens of khz . according to simulations , described in detail in sec .",
    "[ penelope ] , the lead reduced the counting rate for the 511-kev gamma ray by a factor of 70 , whereas the photopeak from 1275-kev gamma rays was reduced by a factor of 5 .",
    "the suppression ranged from factors of @xmath2 3.5 to 4.5 for gamma rays with energies above @xmath2 5 mev . above 4 mev ,",
    "cosmic rays caused a continuum background . in order to remove these unwanted signals , 25-mm thick annular and planar plastic scintillators encased in lead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , were used in anticoincidence with the germanium detectors and are discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath0na(@xmath13 ) signal by this veto was negligible .",
    "in addition to the signals from the high - purity ge detectors , the electronics also processed pmt signals from the scintillators . in order to reduce the rate seen by the detectors due to target radioactivity ,",
    "two techniques were used : 1 ) lead shielding was installed as described above , and 2 ) a high threshold was set ( just below the strong 1275-kev @xmath0na line , so that the target activity could be monitored _ in - situ _ ) .",
    "the ge - signal amplifiers ( ortec 672 ) were operated in a pile - up - rejection mode ( which typically rejected @xmath2 40% and introduced a dead time of 27 @xmath26s per pulse ) .",
    "signals from the two sets of detectors were converted into digital signals by ortec ad413a adcs with fast ferabus readout , which helped to reduce dead time .",
    "a buffer module was used to minimize the communication with the computer via a camac interface .",
    "jam , a java - based data acquisition and analysis package for nuclear physics  @xcite , was used to process the data .",
    "all the nim and camac electronics modules were located in a temperature - controlled rack to minimize instabilities .",
    "the raw rate in each detector was below 30 khz , and the trigger rate was @xmath2 4 khz . a sample background spectrum from one ge detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ samplespectrum ] .",
    "signals from the active anticoincidence shields and from the ge detectors were used as a stop and start , respectively , in a time - to - amplitude - converter ( tac ) . if these two signals occurred within a set timing window , the resulting ge signal was discarded .    in order to determine the bounds of the tac spectrum for data processing ,",
    "the tac signal corresponding to germanium detection energies between 4 and 6 mev was extracted .",
    "the timing gate was set on the prompt peak , which had a long tail to its left . in this energy region , this anticoincidence system rejected @xmath2 80% of the cosmic - ray background signal .",
    "the tac signal for most high - energy cosmic rays from @xmath2 6 to 11 mev also falls within the set window .",
    "the scintillator threshold was set well above 511 kev to avoid vetoes by annihilation radiation .",
    "self veto is possible with cascade gamma decays if one gamma ray is registered in the ge and the other in the anticoincidence shield ; this was examined by comparing the yields from raw singles spectra with those from the vetoed spectra , which agreed to better than 99% .",
    "detector photopeak efficiencies were obtained by combining penelope  @xcite simulations with direct measurements of gamma rays from @xmath54co and @xmath15na sources and from @xmath55 resonance measurements .",
    "the efficiency at 1332 kev was determined using a 31.51-nci @xmath54co source .",

    "as the simulation matched the value we had obtained at 10762 kev , we used the simulation for the 10451 kev value and the known branch to determine the efficiency at 7575 kev .",
    "the agreement between measurement and simulation is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the geometry of our apparatus was modeled in the detailed monte carlo code penelope .",
    "the simulated germanium detector included the germanium crystal , cold finger , and carbon window , with all dimensions taken from the nominal specifications provided by canberra  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we included the 26-mm lead and 25-mm planar plastic scintillator in front of the detector .",
    "although the annular plastic scintillator was modeled , the annular lead was not , as it was not in the line of sight of the target .",
    "the sodium source was a uniform 5-mm diameter disk centered on the copper substrate .",
    "the copper backing mount was included , as was the aluminum plate supporting the water cooling system .",
    "the water and its copper pipes inside the target mount were modeled , but the pipes that extended up and out from the mount were not , as they were thin and mostly out of the line of sight .",
    "all components of the target mount were aligned with the beam , whereas the detector was at an angle of 55@xmath52 .",
    "the gamma rays were projected from their source uniformly in a 80@xmath52 opening angle , which covered all modeled components , and absolute efficiencies were corrected for the solid angle . each simulated",
    "energy included an initial number of gamma rays such that the photopeak precision was less than 0.1% .",
    "at @xmath9 = 1332 kev , with the source spread out over an area equal to that of the 1-mm diameter @xmath54co source , the simulation initially gave results 2.5% higher than the measurement .",
    "therefore , the front face of the crystal was moved back from the target by 1.7 mm , in order to make the simulation reproduce the measurement exactly .",
    "results for the detector photopeak efficiency are shown in the upper panel of fig .",

    "comparison of @xmath58al(@xmath13 ) data to simulation at 7.5 mev indicates agreement to within 2% and is covered by the systematic error detailed in the next section .      in order to extract systematic errors for our efficiencies , we compared the quality of the fit of our data from the @xmath15na source and the 992- and 633-kev resonances of @xmath58al(@xmath13 ) to our simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "the precisely measured ratio for the two @xmath15na gamma rays yields a value for the efficiency at 2754 kev which is in agreement with that given by simulation .",
    "the points obtained from @xmath58al(@xmath13 ) resonances have statistical uncertainties between 4.7 and 5.2% , and they agree well with the simulation .",

    "measurements of the residual activity indicated a 68% loss .",
    "as explained above , loss is not linear and occurs quite rapidly at the end of the cycle . because of this fact , we have chosen to take the loss only from the difference in monitoring the resonance areas , which were taken directly before and after the measurement and gave @xmath126 .",
    "this value was used to adjust the upper limit on the strength , and we assigned a systematic uncertainty of @xmath51 40% to span a wide range approximately down to the value of linear loss .",
