    "attract more attention .",
    "it is notable , the sneia constraint in high redshift values do not give a good clue to investigate the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is obvious the results of individual observations give different values for free parameters of a theoretical model ; hence , it is better that , to estimate the best quantities for free parameters of the model one considers the whole of observational data sets including cmb , sneia , bao and ohd .",
    "therefore , this motivated us to study the behaviour of free parameters and their overlaps .",
    "thence , a collective of observations including sneia , cmb , bao and ohd are considered .",
    "meanwhile the mentioned observational data sets have predicted an ambiguous form of matter which leads to an accelerated phase of present epoch and it is well known as dark energy .",
    "based on this ambiguous form of matter , scientists have proposed different proposals up to now . amongst all of those proposals , the cosmological constant , @xmath7 ,",
    "model attracts more attention @xcite .",
    "but this mechanism suffers two well known drawbacks .",
    "the first of them is related to estimate the contribution of quantum fluctuation of zero point energy and second is related to the ratio of @xmath7 and dark matter energy densities .",
    "these problems and also the excellent work by brans and dicke @xcite motivated scientists to introduce a mechanism which @xmath7 had time dependency , namely quintessence @xcite . beside the quintessence mechanism ,",
    "some proposals which risen from quantum gravity or string theory are introduced to estimate cosmological parameters .",
    "for instance one can refer to tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintum @xcite , k - essense @xcite and so on . also some models which were risen from quantum field fluctuations or space time fluctuations attract more attention to investigate dark energy concept . for such models , one can mention zero point quantum fluctuations(zpqf ) @xcite , holographic dark energy(hde ) @xcite , agegraphic dark energy ( ade ) and new - ade @xcite .",
    "if scalar field , in the quintessence model couples to matter ( non relativistic ) it induces to appear a fifth force .",
    "when the coupling is of order unity , the results of strongly coupling scalar field is not in good agreement with local gravity tests ( for instance in solar system ) .",
    "thus a mechanism should be exist to suppress the effect of fifth force ; such mechanism is capable to reconcile strong coupling models with local experiments was proposed by khoury and weltman @xcite and also , separately , by mota and barrow @xcite namely chameleon . in this mechanism , one can not choose an arbitrary lagrangian for matter , @xmath8 . to avoid deviation of geodesic trajectory",
    ", the author of @xcite has shown the best choices are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is pressure and @xmath12 is energy density of matter , for more discussion we refer reader to @xcite",
    ". therefore main motivation of this work is investigation the behavior of an interacting scalar field mechanism ; based on these calculations and sneia , cmb , bao and ohd data sets the minimum value of @xmath6 for the effective dark energy equation of state are achieved .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows : + the above discussions which are brief review about observational and theoretical motivations are considered as introduction . in sec.2 , the general theoretical discussions risen from a chameleon like mechanism related to the cosmological parameters such as hubble , deceleration and coincidence parameters will be discussed . in sec.3 , a brief review about cosmological data sets are brought . in sec.4 ,",
    "the observational data sets including sneia , cmb , bao and ohd are considered , to estimate the minimum value of @xmath6 related to free parameters of an ansatz for the effective dark energy equation of state . and at last , sec.5",
    ", is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "in chameleon like scalar field scenario , the mass of scalar field is a function of local matter density , so that , it is sufficiently large on dense environment . due to this fact ,",
    "the equivalence principal ( ep ) is satisfied in the laboratory @xcite . in addition",
    ", the brans dicke @xmath13 parameter for two observational values of @xmath14 post newtonian parameter take the values of order @xmath15 @xcite , which satisfies the solar system constraint . the chameleon like scenario",
    "is defined as @xmath16 @xcite . in this equation @xmath17",
    "is the determinant of the metric , @xmath18 is a run away potential and the latest term indicates a non - minimal coupling between scalar field and matter sector .",
    "it should be noted @xmath19 is the lagrangian density of matter which consists of both dark matter and dark energy sectors as perfect fluid @xcite . it should be noticed that , background is a spatially flat friedmann - limatire - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , with signature @xmath20 .",
    "the variation of the action [ eq : action1 ] , with respect to ( w.r.t ) @xmath21 results the gravitational field equation as @xmath22 where the stress - energy density of scalar field expresses @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the definition of stress - energy tensor of matter . by considering @xmath25 and @xmath26 components of @xmath27 , the energy density and pressure could be achieved . after some algebra the conservation equation reads @xmath28 = 0.\\ ] ] in addition , the variation of the action [ eq : action1 ] , w.r.t scalar field gives the evolution equation as @xmath29 now , by substituting equation [ eq : master_phi ] into relation [ eq : conservation_eq_01 ] , two conservation equations for scalar field and matter are attained as @xmath30 & = & \\dot f(\\varphi ) l,\\\\ \\nabla_\\mu   [ f(\\varphi ) t^{\\mu 0 } ] & = &   - \\dot f(\\varphi ) l , \\label{eq : conservation_02 phi:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where over @xmath31 denotes derivation w.r.t ordinary cosmic time , @xmath32 .",

    "namely , one can find that the two lagrangian densities @xmath45 and @xmath46 give the same stress - energy tensor and the equation of motions for all components of the system are similar as well . but in an interacting case , which matter has an interaction with scalar field , the lagrangian degeneracy is broken . based on ref.@xcite ,",

    "in this section , we should emphasis that the analysis is restricted to the background level , and do not include perturbations . in the following ,",
    "we want to compare our theoretical results with observations . to this end , we consider four important data sets including sneia , cmb , bao and ohd . in some papers ,",
    "it was claimed ohd , which obtained versus red shift , is comparable with sneia data set , for instance we refer reader to reference @xcite and references which are there .",
    "this subject motivated us to investigate the effects of this new data set beside other observations to improve the theoretical results .",

    "also there are two ways to study cmb and bao data point among the full parameter distribution and gaussian which in follow the latter will be used .",
    "it is explicit that , supernovae attract more attention in empirical cosmology .",
    "whereas they are very luminous , people interested to consider them , also for instance at closer distances ( i.e. lower redshift ) they could be used to calculate hubble parameter , and for farther distances ( i.e. higher redshift ) they attain an important role to estimate deceleration parameter @xmath79 .",

    "the precision of the results then is mainly determined by the number n of collected reactions . besides the corresponding well defined statistical errors ,",
    "nearly every measurement is subject to further uncertainties , the systematic errors , typically associated with auxiliary parameters related to the measuring apparatus , or with model assumptions .",
    "the result is typically presented in the form @xmath80 the only reason for the separate quotation of the two uncertainties is that the size of the systematic uncertainties is less well known than that of the purely statistical error @xcite . by virtue of the likelihood functions ,",

    "the cmb , bao and ohd have an overlap region , but they are not in agreement with sneia results .",

    "this different behavior of constraints indicates that if one wants to compare theoretical results with observations , it is better the greatest set of constraints , to be considered . for more investigation about overlaps and the effects of individual observations , we plot figures [ projection2dsnecmbbao ] and [ projection2dcmbbaoohd ] . in figure [ projection2dsnecmbbao ] the behaviour of @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath149",

    "these two figures indicate that although the importance of individual ohd data surveying ( in comparison sneia , cmb and bao ) is not so important , but it decreases the degeneracy between free parameters of the model . from figures [ projection2dsnecmbbao ] and [ projection2dcmbbaoohd ] , it is obvious that a collective of four constraints has completely different results in comparison to even three constraints . in the following , by means of observations , we use some custom quantities which are considered for better estimation of theoretical parameters of the model .",
    "since all free parameters of the model are independent , the total likelihood function could be introduced as @xmath152 therefore the total @xmath6 function could be achieved as @xmath153 it is considerable to attain the maximum amount of the probability and the minimum value of @xmath6 , we should minimize @xmath1 .",
    "also it should be noted , in [ total chi2 ] all components have same weight .",
    "so the likelihood method is equivalent to this fact that , for instance all measurements which lead to cmb is equal to a supernova explosion!. afterwards we return to this problem .",

    "now we want to compare the behavior of @xmath164 and @xmath167 functions . without loss the generality of the model , one can plot the three dimensional shape of @xmath164 and @xmath167 , versus free parameters of the model .",

    "it is concluded that , the theoretical prediction of cmb shift parameter is very greater than it s observational quantity . as mentioned heretofore , when the total mean square error function is introduced the weight of all constraints was identical and this causes some problems .",
    "as a matter of fact , the results of likelihood s parameter , equation [ total chi2 ] , the effect of cmb shift parameter in comparison to the abundant sneia data set is ignored . for more information , one can see table [ tab : chi_t_min ] and definition of @xmath156 . to overcome these problems ,",
