    "recently , nonlinear optical properties of nanocomposites have attracted much interest due to their potential applications in high - tech devices . in particular , these nanocomposites are promising substance for photovoltaics , lasers , optical switches and limiters .",
    "the nanocomposites exhibit the nonlinear characteristics much enhanced as against the homogeneous bulk material .",
    "typically , these nanocomposites comprise metallic or semiconductor nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric matrix @xcite . up to now",
    ", the studies of the optical nonlinearity of the dielectric nanoparticles are quite rare @xcite .",
    "an increase in the nonlinear optical properties of the metal - dielectric composites arises from localized surface plasmon resonances while the semiconductor nanocomposites enhance their optical nonlinearity due to quantum confinement effect . among possible sources of the composite optical nonlinearity",
    ", there can occur dipole - dipole interactions between polarized nanoparticles .",
    "the impact of the dipole - dipole interactions increases with rise in nanoparticle concentration in the composite .",
    "the effect of the dipole - dipole interactions on the optical characteristics of the nanocomposite is the most thoroughly studied in the case of the metallic inclusions in the matrix . as a rule ,",
    "these investigations are accomplished by numeric methods @xcite .",
    "one of the popular techniques , the discrete dipole approximation , also known as the coupled dipole approximation , can be exploited for simulating clusters of spheres @xcite .",
    "antosiewicz et al .",
    "@xcite developed the similar approach based on replacing the retarded dipole sum by an integral .",
    "this procedure permitted them to describe analytically optical response of two - dimensional amorphous metallic nanoparticle arrays with interparticle coupling which were observed by experiment @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the coupled dipole method , being a linear approximation , is suitable for weak optical fields .",
    "little attention is given to study the effects of the interparticle dipole - dipole interactions in the semiconductor - dielectric nanocomposites .",
    "normally , the semiconductor nanoparticles have sizes comparable to the exciton bohr radius and possess energy level structure .",
    "external light radiation with some probability excites the nanoparticle in the state with dipole moment , the decay time of this state is much larger than the period of an optical field oscillation .",
    "a model describing the effect of the dipole - dipole interactions on the nonlinear optical properties of such nanocomposites was proposed in ref .",
    "this model deals with the system of semiconductor nanoparticles randomly arranged in the dielectric matrix .",
    "it is assumed that all the excited nanoparticles have equal absolute value @xmath1 of the electric dipole moment which is proportional to the incident light electric field amplitude @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimensionless polarizability of the particle , @xmath5 is its volume , @xmath6 is the dielectric function of the matrix .",
    "the particle dipole moment @xmath7 is assumed to be arbitrarily oriented in space .",
    "this continuous approximation can be justified for the nanoparticles with a number of exciton levels .",
    "the lifetime of the excited state is large in comparison with the period of an optical field , so that the dipoles can be treated in quasi - static approximation . by this means , the @xmath8 excited nanocrystals will induce on the test particle , being located at the coordinate origin , additional random electric field @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dipolar field from the @xmath11-th particle , @xmath12 @xmath13 is the position vector of the @xmath11-th particle and @xmath14 is its dipole moment . as a first approximation , we assume that the net dipolar field @xmath15 does not change the polarizability @xmath4 of the individual particles .",
    "this field is random since the nanoparticles are polarized and placed arbitrarily . in ref .",
    "@xcite , previously obtained distribution functions of the net dipolar field projection @xmath16 @xcite was utilized . for volume concentrations ( volume fractions ) of the excited nanoparticles @xmath17 the gaussian distribution",
    "was used as distribution functions of the random field @xmath16 .    in this work ,",
    "we employ for bulk samples the negative cumulant expansion proposed for the two - dimensional distribution of dipoles @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to obtain the third - order self - induced optical susceptibility for volume fractions @xmath18 which frequently occur in experiments .",
    "moreover , we will calculate the third - order susceptibilities for various angular configurations of the dipoles .",
    "]    let us consider an ensemble of identical spherical particles randomly arranged in the dielectric matrix which is illustrated in fig .  [ schem ] .",
    "the radius of the particles is @xmath19 . the external laser radiation with some probability causes transition of the particles to excited state with dipole moment .",
    "after some period , a large portion of the particles will be in polarized state . in order to proceed ,",
    "we should obtain distribution function @xmath20 of the net dipolar random field projection @xmath16 onto the selected direction .",
    "the use of the field projection instead of vectors allows us to discuss without loss of generality several angular configurations of the dipoles . in a general way",
    ", this distribution function can be written as @xmath21\\prod^n_{l = 1 } \\tau_l\\left ( \\mathbf{p}_l \\right)\\ , \\mathrm{d } \\mathbf{p}_{l}\\ , \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\\ , \\mathrm{d } e , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the distribution function for dipole moment orientations , @xmath23 is the dirac @xmath23-function .",
    "we assume that due to macroscopic isotropy @xmath24 is identical for all the particles , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . after applying markov s method @xcite",

    "( [ defmun ] ) begins from @xmath40 which is the minimum distance between two sphere centers .",
    "the cumulant expansion in eq .",
    "( [ wseriesbulk ] ) is done under the assumption that the number of the dipoles with one direction is balanced by dipoles with opposite alignment owing to the random nature of the excitement .",
    "thus , this expansion has only even - numbered terms @xcite , the odd - numbered @xmath34 are zero .",
    "then , following ref .",
    "@xcite , after gibbs averaging , we obtain the density of free energy of the ensemble @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the temperature and @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant , and the projection of macroscopic polarization @xmath44 onto the selected direction , resulting from the dipole - dipole interactions , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes time averaging . for linear or circular light polarization , by expressing @xmath44 as a series in powers of the applied optical field amplitude @xmath2",

    "it is worth emphasizing that eq .",
    "( [ chi3 - 3d ] ) can be applied not only to the dipole - dipole interactions but also to other types of interparticle couplings . in the latter case ,",
    "@xmath37 will be defined by other formulas . since the variance @xmath58",
    ", the contribution of interparticle interactions into the self - induced kerr nonlinear susceptibility is always negative .",
    "if one continue expansion in ( [ pseries ] ) then the next nonzero term will contain @xmath59 : @xmath60    in the statement of this model , we have inferred that the dipole moment of the particles linearly depends on the incident field amplitude ( [ p : ein ] ) .",
    "we may abandon this approximation replacing eq .",
    "( [ p : ein ] ) with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the third - order hyperpolarizability of the individual nanoparticle . after repeating all the calculations",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath62 makes a contribution to the fifth - order nonlinearity of the system @xmath63 .",
    "in the following , we discuss several dipole arrangements . when all the excited dipoles are collinear with two equiprobable opposite orientations , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the polar and azimuthal angles specifying @xmath7 .",
    "such a configuration of the dipoles is expected when the linearly polarized light wave propagates through the nanocomposite",

    "( [ chi3 - 3d ] ) @xmath69 this formula was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite under the assumption of gaussian distribution as @xmath20 .    in the case of arbitrarily oriented dipoles",
    "@xmath70 and integration in ( [ defmun ] ) gives @xmath71    further , let us consider the dipoles chaotically oriented with @xmath7 lying in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane , i.e. @xmath7 has only @xmath72 and @xmath73 components .",
    "this arrangement can occur when the nanocomposite is embedded in planar waveguide with propagating tm - polarized wave . in this case",
    ", we select the direction in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane , e.g. @xmath72 . then , the distribution function for dipole moment orientations becomes @xmath74 and @xmath75    it should be underlined that the relative change of @xmath37 in ( [ mu2 - 3disingpar ] ) , ( [ mu2 - 3darbitrary ] ) , and ( [ mu2 - 3darbitraryx - y ] ) does not exceed @xmath76% despite the high anisotropy of the dipolar field .",
    "this fact can be attributed to the random placement of the nanoparticles in the matrix .",
    "thus , the variation of the dipole arrangements affect insignificantly the contribution of the dipole - dipole interactions to the third - order nonlinear optical susceptibility of the nanocomposite .",
    "typically , the ii - vi semiconductor quantum dots in the excited state possess the large values of the electric dipole moment @xcite . hence",
    ", it is reasonable to make a comparison to the nanocomposites containing such quantum dots . given @xmath77 @xcite , @xmath78 , @xmath79  nm , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82  k , using eqs .",
    "( [ chi3 - 3d ] ) , ( [ mu2 - 3darbitrary ] ) one can calculate that @xmath83  esu .",
    "this value is of the same order as observed by experiment with nanosecond laser pulses for cadmium chalcogenide nanocomposites ( @xmath84  esu ) @xcite . as a rule",
    ", under femtosecond laser pulses , the nanocomposites with cadmium chalcogenide quantum dots show the positive real part of the third - order susceptibility @xcite , but at nanosecond pulse durations they display the negative sign of that @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may be attributed to the influence of the interparticle dipole - dipole coupling on the third - order susceptibility as this effect will become substantial upon exciting enough quantity of the nanoparticles . at shorter timescales other fast optical nonlinearities (",
    "e.g. two - photon absorption , free - carrier absorption and dispersion , bound electronic kerr effect , quantum - confined stark effect ) will prevail .",
    "it should be stressed that the susceptibility nonlinearity ( [ chi3 - 3d ] ) in this model arises from the random field dispersion that yields nonzero @xmath37 and higher order moments in eq .",
    "( [ wseriesbulk ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath37 makes a contribution to the third - order susceptibility , @xmath38 does to @xmath59 and so forth .",
    "this result can not be obtained within the framework of mean - field theories including effective - medium theories which lack the field dispersion . in other words ,",
    "the mean - field models has only one distribution function moment @xmath36 ( the mean field ) .",
    "such theories can only translate the nonlinearity of one constituent to the effective nonlinearity of the mixture @xcite .",
    "notice , that in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite in this work the expressions for @xmath57 are obtained without restriction on certain ranges of nanoparticle volume fractions . the expression for @xmath57 calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath85 is almost twice than @xmath57 computed with eq .",
    "( [ chi3gau ] ) but the first was obtained under the rather rough limitation of the maximum field value in the use of the cauchy - lorentzian distribution .",
    "in summary , the analytical expressions for the contribution of the dipole - dipole coupling @xmath57 to the kerr optical nonlinearity of the system of the randomly located nanoparticles have been derived for the nanoparticle volume concentrations of several percent .",
    "this contribution is caused by the dispersion of the random dipolar field .",
    "the dipolar induced contribution to the third - order susceptibility is calculated for different types of dipole configurations which are connected with the light polarization .",
    "it has been shown that for the different dipole arrangements @xmath57 varies moderately ."
