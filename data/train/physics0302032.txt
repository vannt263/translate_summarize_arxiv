    "a graph ( network ) of vertices ( nodes ) and edges is a useful tool in describing the interactions between different agents of a complex system .",
    "for example if we want to analyze protein - protein physical interactions in yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _",
    "@xcite , we would like to denote each protein as a distinct vertex of a graph , and setup an edge between two vertices if the corresponding proteins have direct physical interactions .",
    "many such kinds of networks are constructed in sociological , biological , and technological fields , and they usually have very complicated connection patterns . what one needs is a method that is capable of classifying vertices of a complex network into different clusters ( communities ) .",
    "if a network is appropriately decomposed into a series of functional units , ( a ) the structure of the network can be better understood and the relationship between its different components will be clear , ( b ) the principal function of each cluster can be inferred from the functions of its members , and ( c ) possible functions for members of a cluster can be suggested by comparing the functions of other members .",
    "network clustering techniques are therefore very important in the emerging fields of bioinformatics and proteomics .",
    "a good clustering method needs to satisfy two conditions : first , the inherent structure of the network should be reserved ; second , it should provide a quantified resolution parameter to mark the significance of the clusters obtained at each level of the partitioning process .",
    "the global organization of a network should already be identified at low resolutions and more and more fine structures emerge as the resolving power is increased .",
    "many existing methods @xcite only take account of local information of each vertex , such as number of nearest - neighbors shared with other vertices , number of vertex - independent paths to other vertices , etc .. recently , girvan and newman @xcite suggested an elegant global algorithm which extended the concept of vertex betweenness centrality of freeman @xcite also to edges .",
    "their algorithm works iteratively by removing the current edge(s ) of the highest degree of betweenness centrality .",
    "when applying to an ensemble of random modular networks , this algorithm greatly outperforms some conventional methods @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it does not provide a parameter to quantify the differences between communities .",
    "in reference @xcite a brownian particle is @xmath0introduced `` into a network to @xmath0measure '' the distances between vertices . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the basic idea of @xcite by defining , based on this distance matrix , a quantity called the dissimilarity index between nearest - neighboring vertices .",
    "the dissimilarity index signifies to what extent two nearest - neighboring vertices would like to be in the same community . a hierarchical algorithm",
    "is then worked out ; it takes use of information on the dissimilarity indices and decompose a network into a hierarchical sequence of clusters .",
    "each of the communities is characterized by an upper and a lower dissimilarity threshold .",
    "the method , which could work on unweighted as well as weighted networks , is applied to several artificial and real networks , and very satisfying results are obtained . for the case of random modular networks , the present algorithm outperforms the method of girvan and newman @xcite . when applying the algorithm to the protein - protein interaction network of yeast , we are able to identify many protein clusters which have well defined biological functions .",
    "in section [ sec : measures ] we review the distance measure of reference @xcite and define a dissimilarity index for each pair of nearest - neighboring vertices .",
    "a dissimilarity - index - based hierarchical algorithm is outlined in section [ sec : algorithm ] , and applied to two kinds of artificially generated networks and four real - world networks in section [ sec : application ] .",
    "we conclude our work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the opinion of flake , lawrence , and giles @xcite , a community in a ( sub)graph should satisfy the requirement that each vertex s total intra - community interaction be stronger than the total interaction with other vertices in the ( sub)graph . this turns out to be a very strong constraint . in this work",
    ", we weaken this condition and require only that a vertex should have stronger total interaction with other vertices of its own community than with vertices of any another community of the ( sub)graph .",
    "we consider a connected network of @xmath1 vertices and @xmath2 edges .",
    "the network s connection pattern is specified by the generalized adjacency matrix @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the value of each non - zero element of matrix @xmath3 ( say @xmath4 ) denotes the interaction strength between vertex @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the distance , @xmath7 , from vertex @xmath5 to vertex @xmath6 is defined as the average number of steps needed for a brownian particle on this network to move from vertex @xmath5 to vertex @xmath6 @xcite . at each vertex ( say @xmath8 )",
    "the brownian particle will jump in the next step to a nearest - neighboring vertex ( say @xmath9 ) with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the distance matrix thus defined is asymmetric ( in general @xmath11 ) , and it is calculated by solving @xmath1 linear - algebraic equations @xcite .    taking any vertex @xmath5 as the origin of the network , then the set @xmath12 measures how far all the other vertices are located from the origin . therefore it is actually a perspective of the whole network with vertex @xmath5 being the viewpoint .",
    "suppose vertex @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nearest - neighbors ( @xmath13 ) , the difference in their perspectives about the network can be quantitatively measured .",
    "we define the dissimilarity index , @xmath14 , by the following expression : @xmath15 ^ 2 }   \\over ( n-2)}.\\ ] ] if two nearest - neighboring vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 belong to the same community , then the average distance @xmath16 from @xmath5 to any another vertex @xmath8 ( @xmath17 ) will be quite similar to the average distance @xmath18 from @xmath6 to @xmath8 , therefore the network s two perspectives ( based on @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) will be quite similar .",
    "consequently , @xmath14 will be small if @xmath5 and @xmath6 belong to the same community and large if they belong to different communities .",
    "we exploit the dissimilarity index to decipher the community structure of a network . after the distance matrix @xmath19 and",
    "the dissimilarity indices for all the nearest - neighboring vertices @xmath20 are obtained , the algorithm works as follows :    1 . : :    intially the whole network is just one single community .",
    "this    community is assigned an upper dissimilarity threshold    @xmath21 equalling to the maximum value of all    the different dissimilarity indices .",
    "2 . : :    for each community , a resolution threshold parameter    @xmath22 is introduced and is assigned the initial value    @xmath21 of that community . the algorithm is    unable to discriminate between two nearest - neighboring vertices    @xmath5 and @xmath6 when    @xmath23 ; if this happens , vertices    @xmath5 and @xmath6 are marked as    @xmath0friends \" .",
    ":    the @xmath22 value is decreased differentially .",
    "all edges    in the community are examined to see whether two nearest - neighboring    vertices are friends .",
    "different friends sets of the community are then    formed , each of which contains all the friends of the vertices in the    set .",
    "there may also be vertices in the community that do not have any    friends .",
    "each of these vertices is moved to the friends set that has    the strongest interaction with it .",
    "after this operation , vertices of    the community are distributed into a number of disjointed sets ( this    number may be unity ) .",
    "4 . : :    each vertex in a subcluster should have stronger interaction with    vertices within this subcluster than with vertices of any another    subcluster of this community . to fulfill this requirement ,",
    "we perform    a local adjustment process : move each of the vertices that fail to    meet this requirement to the friends set that has the strongest total    interaction with it .",
    "this adjustment process is performed    simultaneously for all these unstable vertices and is repeated until    no unstable vertices remains . 5 .",
    ": :    if vertices of the community remain together , the algorithm returns to    step 3 .",
    "if they are divided into two or more sets , then the community    under processing is assigned a lower dissimilarity threshold    @xmath24 equalling to the current    @xmath22 value , and it is no longer considered .",
    "each of    the identified subsets of this community is regarded as a new    ( lower - level ) community , with upper dissimilarity threshold    @xmath21 equalling to the current    @xmath22 value .",
    "the algorithm returns to step 2 to work    with another identified community .",
    "6 . : :    after all the ( sub)communities are processed , a dendrogram is drawn to    demonstrate the relationship between different communities as well as    the upper and lower dissimilarity thresholds of each community .",
    "the    vertex set of each community is also reported .",
    "the above procedure could be easily implemented with c++ programming language .",
    "the source code as well as the data for the examples studied in the following section will be made publicly available @xcite .",
    "we test the performance of the above - mentioned algorithm by applying it first to two kinds of artificial networks and to three real - world networks .",
    "to quantitatively compare with the work of girvan and newman @xcite the algorithm is first applied to a random modular network .",
    "the network has @xmath25 nodes , which are divided into @xmath26 modules of size @xmath27 each .",
    "each vertex has on average @xmath28 edges connecting to other vertices , and on average @xmath29 of each vertex s edges are to vertices of other modules .",
    "all the edges are setup randomly with these two fixed expectation values .",
    "the present method is able to recover the modular structure of the network up to @xmath30 .",
    "it slight outperforms the method of girvan and newman @xcite in performance .",
    "for example , working on an ensemble of random graphs with @xmath31 by the present method , on average only @xmath32 vertices are misclassified , each of which is assigned a cluster identity different from those of the majority of vertices of its module ; while on average about @xmath33 vertices are misclassified by the method of girvan and newman @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the community structure of a randomly generated modular network with @xmath31 is demonstrated . when the resolution threshold is beyond @xmath34 ,",
    "the network as a whole could be regarded as a giant community . at resolution threshold @xmath34 , however , @xmath35 subgroups suddenly emerge , with size @xmath27 , @xmath27 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the first two communities correspond to two modules of the network , and the last one is the merge of the other two modules . at resolution threshold @xmath37 , this later community again is divided into two subcommunities of @xmath27 vertices each , corresponding to the remaining two modules . at resolution threshold @xmath38 , one of the modules of the network",
    "is found to fission into two subgroups of size @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . in this example , the designed four modules of the network correspond to the resolution range from @xmath38 to @xmath37 .    how to interpret the resolution parameters in the dengrograms such as that shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ?",
    "take module @xmath41 and module @xmath35 as examples .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] suggests that edges between these two modules have dissimilarity indices larger than @xmath34 , while edges within these modules have dissimilarity indices @xmath42 .",
    "therefore there is a large dissimilarity gap of about @xmath43 between an inter - modular edge and an intra - modular edge .",
    "it is noticeable that by the present algorithm , each community has certain range of stability .",
    "subcommunities emerge only when the resolution threshold is lowered below certain level , and they emerge abruptly .",
    "we analyze here the community structure of the model hierarchy network studied by ravasz and coauthors @xcite .",
    "the network is constructed by several steps @xcite : at level @xmath44 , a fully connected unit of four vertices is generated . at level @xmath45 ,",
    "three replicas of this unit are added and the external vertices of these replicas are connected to the central vertex of the @xmath44 unit , while the central vertices of the replicas are connected to each other .",
    "this replication - connection process could be continued to any desired level @xmath46 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2]a such a network at level @xmath47 is shown . it was remarked @xcite that conventional network clustering methods are unable to uncover the hierarchical structure of such a network .",
    "the present method , however , works very well : figure [ fig : fig2]b demonstrates the obtained community structure of the network figure [ fig : fig2]a . the hierarchy organization of the vertices in the network",
    "is largely reserved in [ fig : fig2]b . at resolution threshold",
    "@xmath48 the network is divided into @xmath26 subgroups of size @xmath35 and a giant component of size @xmath49 .",
    "later at resolution threshold @xmath50 , this giant component again is fissioned into @xmath41 parts : one part has size @xmath51 and is further divided into @xmath35 subgroups of size @xmath26 at resolution threshold @xmath52 ; the other part has size @xmath53 , which , at resolution threshold @xmath54 further decomposes into @xmath35 subgroups of size @xmath33 , @xmath33 , and @xmath39 , respectively . at resolution threshold @xmath55 , each of these three subgroups",
    "is further divided into @xmath35 subgroups .      the karate club data @xcite examined in references @xcite and @xcite is re - evaluated here .",
    "this network is weighted , each edge is assigned a different strength .",
    "the present algorithm leads to the community structure of figure [ fig : fig3 ] . at resolution threshold",
    "the network decomposes into one small component of @xmath57 vertices and a large component of @xmath58 vertices . at resolution",
    "threshold @xmath59 , this large component further decomposes into two subgroups , one of which has @xmath40 members and the other has @xmath60 members .",
    "comparison with the actual fission pattern is also shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .      the foot - ball team network compiled by girvan and newman @xcite and studied in references @xcite and @xcite is re - investigated here .",
    "the present method results in the community structure of figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "each vertex s actual group - identity is also shown for comparison . in the resolution region between @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "there are @xmath51 communities according to the present algorithm . of the @xmath51",
    "actual groups , only members from group-@xmath51 are distributed to other groups ( with good reasons , because actually there are very few direct interactions between the five members of this cluster ) .",
    "vertex @xmath63 are classified together with members of group-@xmath60 , we have checked that this vertex has @xmath64 edges linking to group-@xmath60 and only @xmath35 edges to other groups .",
    "vertex @xmath65 is classified together with members of group-@xmath66 , we have also checked that it has stronger interaction with group-@xmath66 than with any another group .",
    "the organization of the different teams suggested by the present algorithm seems to be even better than the original organization .      the scientific collaboration network compiled by girvan and newman @xcite and examined in references @xcite",
    "and @xcite is also re - examined .",
    "this network is also weighted .",
    "the present method suggests a community structure shown in figure [ fig : fig5 ] . in accordance with the actual situation , on the global scale , the network clearly has @xmath35 giant communities of comparable sizes .",
    "each of these giant communities could further be decomposed into several subcommunities when the resolving power is increased .",
    "the protein interaction network of yeast is constructed based on the data reported in references @xcite and @xcite , it contains @xmath67 proteins and @xmath68 edges ( protein - protein physical interactions ) .",
    "this network has already been studied in reference @xcite ; here we constructed a reduced interaction network based on the original one .",
    "first , self - connection is removed ; second , proteins which are connected to the network by only one edge are removed .",
    "the second step is continued until no proteins of degree one remains .",
    "the reason to remove all the proteins of degree one is that , according to the idea of girvan and newman @xcite , a vertex that is connected to the network by just one edge should be in the same community as its nearest - neighboring vertex , therefore its status need not to be considered separately . of cause",
    ", we have checked that actually identical results are obtained when the network - reduction process is not performed .",
    "the reduced network contains @xmath69 proteins and @xmath70 unweighted interactions ( edges ) .",
    "the community structure of this network is demonstrated in figure [ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "it seems to be strikingly different from those of the other networks studied in this paper .",
    "at the resolution range between @xmath71 to @xmath72 many small communities appear , but the network is dominated by just one large cluster of size proportional to the total size of the network .",
    "this is in accordance with reference @xcite where the original network was decomposed into one large component and several small components .",
    "when the resolution threshold is decreased below @xmath73 , the largest cluster is divided into several subclusters of comparable sizes .",
    "the biological significance of such a community structure is yet to be investigated .",
    "based on the community structure shown in figure [ fig : fig6 ] , we can construct clusters of proteins that might be of biological significance .",
    "here we just show three examples of such protein clusters , corresponding respectively to higher , medial , and lower resolution thresholds .",
    "1.0 cm    1.0 cm    the first example is a cluster which appears at resolution threshold @xmath74 .",
    "it contains @xmath28 proteins and @xmath75 edges , and has the structure shown in figure [ fig : fig7]a .",
    "this cluster is stable , namely that each vertex in it is more connected to vertices in this cluster than to vertices outside ; and it has no further subcommunity structure . according to the protein interaction databank @xcite , @xmath76 of these proteins are all involved in atp synthesis process in yeast .",
    "they may form a very important part of yeast s mitochondrial atpase complex .",
    "one protein of this cluster , yil124w , is a hypothetical membrane protein .",
    "because this last protein has only one interaction with other members of the cluster , it may not have similar biological functions as the other members .",
    "the second example is a cluster which appears at resolution threshold @xmath77 .",
    "it contains @xmath60 proteins and @xmath78 edges , and has the structure shown in figure [ fig : fig7]b .",
    "this cluster is also stable and has no further structure . according to the protein interaction databank @xcite , among these @xmath60 proteins ,",
    "ybl084c , yfr036w , yhr166c , ykl022c are known to be cell division control proteins ; ygl240w plays a role in cell cycle and mitosis ; ydr118w , ynl172w , yor249c probably are membrane proteins ; and ylr127c , ydl008w , ylr102c are hypothetical proteins whose functions remain to be determined . it is quite likely that all the proteins in this cluster are closely involved in cell division and membrane fission process . we anticipate that the three hypothetical proteins of this cluster will also have similar biological functions .    the third example is a cluster which appears only when the resolution threshold is refined to below @xmath79 .",
    "it contains @xmath39 proteins and @xmath80 protein - protein interactions .",
    "this cluster is also stable and has no further structure .",
    "the interaction pattern of this cluster is demonstrated in figure [ fig : fig7]c . among these @xmath39 proteins , according to the protein interaction databank @xcite , ycr093w , ypr072w , ydl165w , yer068w , yil038c are general negative regulator of transcription subunits ; yal021c is a glucose - repressible alcohol dehydrogenase transcriptional effector ; ynr052c is a ubiquitous transcription factor ; ydr443c , ygr104c are suppressors of rna polymerases ; ynl025c is the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme cyclin - like subunit ; ypl042c is the meiotic mrna stability protein kinase ume5 ; ygr092w is the cell cycle protein kinase dbf2 ; and ykr036c and yfl028c are two hypothetical proteins .",
    "it is quite likely that this cluster is mainly involved in rna transcription process and we also anticipate that the two hypothetical proteins of this cluster are strongly related with this biological function .    to conclude this subsection",
    ", we stress that , based on the community structure of figure [ fig : fig6 ] many clusters of proteins can be constructed . here",
    "we have mentioned just three examples .",
    "these identified protein clusters could help researchers to assign possible biological functions to hypothetical proteins , and could also suggest possible proteins that may be involved in carrying out a particular biological reaction .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite , the distance between two vertices of a graph is defined as the average number of steps a brownian particle takes to move from one vertex to the other . based on this distance measure , in the present work we define a dissimilarity index to signify to what extent two nearest - neighboring vertices will be different from each other .",
    "we observe that vertices belonging to the same group usually have very small dissimilarity indices between them , while vertices of different communities usually have large dissimilarity indices between them .",
    "the observation leads naturally to an algorithm of network clustering .",
    "we applied this method to several artificial networks and also to different real networks in social and biological systems and satisfactory results are obtained .",
    "different clusters of a network obtained by our method are characterized by a range of resolution threshold .",
    "the examples studied by us in this paper suggest that our algorithm is very promising in identifying the community structure of a complex networked system .",
    "why it works ?",
    "maybe it is because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the vertex - vertex distance measure has taken into account the topological structure of the network as well as the local connections of the network .",
    "the distances from one vertex to all the other vertices of the network actually give a perspective of the whole network viewed from this vertex .",
    "second , the dissimilarity index defined by equation ( [ dsi ] ) compares the perspectives viewed from two nearest - neighboring vertices .",
    "it is intuitively appealing to assume that the perspectives of the different vertices of the same community are similar to each other while those of vertices of different communities will be quite different .",
    "it is anticipated that the present work will find applications in the field of complex networks , as well as in the fields of sociological and biological sciences .",
    "this research is made possible by a post - doctoral fellowship from the max - planck society .",
    "the author is grateful to professor reinhard lipowsky for his constant support ."
