    "knots and links are a fascinating subject and are researched in connection with many concrete applications both in physics and biology @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the statistical mechanics of a system of two entangled polymer rings .",
    "mathematically , two or more entangled polymers form what is called a link .",
    "single polymer rings form instead knots .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to systems in the configurations of @xmath1plats .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath1plats are knots or links obtained by braiding together a set of @xmath2 strings and connecting their ends pairwise @xcite",
    ". a physical realization of @xmath1plats could be that of two rings topologically entangled together and with some of their points attached to two membranes or surfaces located at different heights",
    ". in nature @xmath1plats occur for example in the dna of living organisms @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is believed that most knots and links formed by dna are in the class of @xmath3plats @xcite .",
    "these biological applications have inspired the research of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath3plats have been studied with the methods of statistical mechanics and field theory . in particular , in @xcite it has been established an analogy between polymeric @xmath3plats and anyons , showing in this way the tight relations between two component systems of quasiparticles and the theory of knots and links . after the publication of @xcite , interesting applications of analogous anyon systems to topological quantum computing has been proposed @xcite .",
    "these applications are corroborated by the results of experiments concerning the detection of anyons obeying a nonabelian statistics , see for example @xcite .",
    "while these results have appeared in 2005 and are still under debate @xcite , other systems in which non - abelian anyon statistics could be present have been discussed @xcite . in the present case",
    ", the topology of the original two - polymer link is distinguished by the gauss linking invariant , which can be obtrained from the amplitudes of an abelian bf model @xcite .",
    "this implies that the statistics of the quasiparticles treated here is purely abelian .",
    "however , also abelian anyons may be exploited for quantum computations as it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .    motivated by these recent advances , we study here the general case of @xmath1plats formed by two polymer rings . among all knot and link configurations ,",
    "the class of @xmath1plats is very special .",
    "for instance , it is possible to decompose the trajectory of a @xmath1plat into a set of @xmath2 open subtrajectories that can be further interpreted as the trajectories of @xmath2 polymer chains directed along a special direction . without losing generality , we may suppose that this direction coincides with the @xmath4axis .",
    "when the system of directed polymers is mapped into a field theory , a model describing anyon quasiparticles is obtained .",
    "the @xmath5 coordinate can be related to `` time '' , while the monomer densities of the @xmath2 directed polymers become the quasiparticle densities of a multicomponent anyon model .",
    "a remarkable feature of polymers in @xmath1plat configurations is that they admit self - dual solutions in which the energy of the system is minimized @xcite .",
    "here we show that these solutions can be explicitly constructed by solving a sinh - gordon equation .",
    "the conformations corresponding to such solutions should be particularly stable and thus observable , at least in principle . with the present technologies @xcite , in fact , it is possible to realize polymer @xmath1plats in the laboratory .",
    "another advantage of restricting ourselves to @xmath1plats configurations is that it is possible to distinguish their topological states in a more efficient way than what one could achieve in the general case of two linked polymer rings .",
    "let us recall at this point that the trajectories of real polymers are impenetrable and thus , if no rupture occurs , they are bound to stay in the initial topological state while subjected to thermal fluctuations . however , in the edwards model used here polymers are `` phantom '' @xcite . without any control , their trajectories are allowed to cross themselves and thus the global topological configuration of the system may change . to find a powerful and reliable method in order to forbid such changes of topology is the most difficult problem of the statistical mechanics of polymer knots and links .",
    "up to now there is no analytical model that is able to deal with the statistical mechanics of polymer knots .",
    "for this reason , in this work we assume that each polymer ring composing the link can be in any knot configuration .",
    "only the topological configurations of the link formed by polymers belonging to the @xmath1plat will be distinguished .",
    "this goal is achieved by using the gauss linking number in order to impose the necessary topological constraints .",
    "the gauss linking number is a topological invariant given in the form of a double contour integral , where the contours coincide with the polymer trajectories .",
    "unfortunately , it is a weak topological invariant , so that many nonequivalent topological configurations characterized by the same value of the gauss linking number are allowed .",
    "however , once we restrict ourselves to a given @xmath1plat , we are implicitly imposing a much more stringent topological condition on the system . indeed , its topological states are in this way not only limited by the value of the gauss linking number , but are also forced to vary within the much smaller set of states that are compatible with the structure of the @xmath1plat .",
    "even if the gauss linking number is one of the simplest topological invariants , its expression is very complicated . as a consequence , after imposing the topological constraints , the action of a system of topologically entangled polymers becomes both nonlocal and nonpolynomial .",
    "the nonlocality is due to the double contour integral over the polymer trajectories .",
    "the nonpolynomiality arises from the fact that the integrand is a nonpolynomial function of the components of the radius vectors determining the positions of the monomers in the space .",
    "the situation is somewhat reminiscent to that of holomic constraints in the classical mechanics of particles .",
    "when these constraints are fixed by means of lagrange multipliers , within the particle action new terms appear which are related to the reaction forces .",
    "the striking difference is that topological constraints are not holonomic and have `` memory '' in order to keep track of the global conformation of the chain .",
    "this last property causes the nonlocality of the action after fixing the constraints .",
    "the price to be paid to recover locality and to have a standard action is to introduce topological fields which interact with the monomers in such a way that the topological configuration of the link is preserved .",
    "to some extent , these interactions may be considered as the equivalents of the reaction forces in classical mechanics .",
    "the passage to the topological field theory description is not straightforward . in particular",
    ", it requires to find a topological field theory with an amplitude of metric independent and gauge invariant operators from which it is possible to isolate the particular topological invariant used to fix the topological constraints .",
    "if the topological invariant is the gauss linking number and the two topologically linked rings are represented as continuous curves embedded in the space and parametrized by their arc - lengths , this task has been achieved in @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the two rings are constructed out of a set of @xmath2 open subtrajectories parametrized by the @xmath5 coordinate and not by the arc - length .",
    "this parametrization is very peculiar because it identifies the parameter specifying the positions of the monomers with one coordinate of the space in which the monomers are fluctuating .",
    "for all the above reasons , the passage to topological field theories explained in @xcite can not be straightforwardly applied to the present situation and has required a separate derivation . as a result of this derivation",
    ", we have been able to show that the path integral expressing the probability function of a @xmath1plat formed by two polymer rings entangled together is equivalent to the correlation function of a gas of @xmath6 particles of type 1 and @xmath7 particles of type 2 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the interactions between these particles are mediated by the vector fields of an abelian bf model .",
    "this is a topological gauge field theory that has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the particles are also subjected to short - range interactions whose origin is the following .",
    "the @xmath2 directed paths composing the two - polymer link are treated here like paths of directed polymers in random media @xcite , which are subjected to quenched random potentials .",
    "after integrating over the random noise according to the prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the polymer action of the @xmath2 directed polymers appear potentials describing short - range forces acting on the monomers .",
    "the final passage to field theory is performed using the analog in statistical mechanics of the second quantization process . to this purpose , we generalized the method used by de gennes and coworkers @xcite to achieve the field theory formulation in the case of a single polymer chain subjected to short - range interactions to the case of a set of @xmath2 different polymers .",
    "in the `` second quantized '' version of the statistical mechanics of the @xmath1plat , the scalar fields create and destroy monomers in different positions of the space . the square module of such fields may be related to the monomer density at a certain point .",
    "the bf fields take into account the interactions necessary to keep the system in its initial topological configuration .",
    "the abelian bf model has been quantized in the coulomb gauge , because in this gauge the analogy with anyon field theories becomes particularly explicit .",
    "the obtained field theory is a multicomponent model of anyons such those described for instance in @xcite .",
    "this kind of theories exhibits the phenomenon of superconductivity .",
    "the only difference in our case is that the scalar fields containing the creation and annihilation operators for particles of type 1 and 2 are organized in replica multiplets , where at the end the limit of zero replicas should be taken .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first of all , to map the partition function of two linked polymer rings into that of anyons , it is necessary to split their trajectories into a set of @xmath2 subtrajectories , which in the anyon model describe the evolution in time of the quasiparticles .",
    "the splitting procedure and the definition of a time variable that is able to parametrize the @xmath2 subtrajectories is carefully described in section  [ sectionii ] . a proof that it is possible to isolate from the amplitudes of the bf model the gauss linking number also after splitting the trajectories and changing their parametrization ,",
    "is presented in section  [ sectioniii ] .",
    "the fact that after quantizing the bf model in the coulomb gauge it is still possible to recover the gauss linking number from the amplitudes of the holonomies is shown in the particular case of a @xmath3plat in appendix  b. in section  [ sectioniv ] the partition function of two linked polymers subjected to topological constraints imposed with the help of the gauss linking invariant is transformed into a theory of @xmath2 directed polymers interacting with the magnetic - like fields of the bf model .",
    "contrarily to ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat the @xmath2 subtrajectories as trajectories of real directed polymers .",
    "this requires the introduction of random potentials which complicates somewhat the passage to the anyon field theory performed in section  [ sectionv ] .",
    "in the anyon formulation , the densities of monomers associated to the two original polymer rings can be regarded as the densities of anyon quasiparticles of type 1 and 2 interacting together .",
    "thanks to a bogomolnyi transformation , the interactions may be split into a self - dual part and a part containing only short - range interactions . remarkably , the latter interactions persists even if the short - range interactions coming from the random media are switched off .",
    "this is an effect of the presence of the topological constraint . in section  [ sectionvi ]",
    "it is reviewed for completeness the case of a @xmath3plat studied in @xcite .",
    "the static configurations of the anyon densities that minimize the hamiltonian are computed .",
    "it is shown that the anyon model admits static self - dual points .",
    "the nature of the density configurations corresponding to these self - dual points is analyzed in section  [ sectionvii ] .",
    "we prove that the solutions of the classical equations of motion that minimize the static hamiltonian are self - dual configurations , whose exact form can be obtained after solving a sinh - gordon equation .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sectionviii ] .",
    "let s consider two closed loops @xmath9 and @xmath10 of lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively in a three dimensional space with coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the vectors @xmath14 span the two dimensional space @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath5 will play later on the role of time .",
    "the two loops will be labeled by using a indices the first letters of the latin alphabet : @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath9 and @xmath10 form a @xmath1plat .",
    "for convenience , we briefly review what is a @xmath1plat .",

    "is composed by three arcs , one overpass and two underpasses .",
    "one may also realize that the treefoil diagram in fig .",
    "[ treefoil ] is characterized by two minima and two maxima .",
    "two dimensional diagrams of this kind , deformed in such a way that the number @xmath2 of minima and maxima is the smallest possible and the maxima and minima are aligned at the same heights @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , are called in knot theory @xmath1plats  .",
    "the height of a @xmath1plat is measured here with respect to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "@xmath1plats are used to classify knots and links by dividing them into classes characterized by the same value of @xmath20 .",
    "the concept of @xmath1plats arises naturally in biochemistry , see e.  g.  @xcite . in the present case , with some abuse of language , we will call @xmath1plats also the two dimensional diagrams in which maxima and minima are not aligned , like for instance in fig .",
    "[ basiclink ] .",

    "moreover , we should put for consistency : @xmath31 the introduction of this double notation for the same height @xmath27 will be useful in the following in order to write formulas in a more compact form . in the following the @xmath1plats @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be decomposed into a set of directed trajectories @xmath32 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 , whose ends are made to coincide in such a way that they form the topological configuration of two linked rings .",

    "the trajectory @xmath32 becomes parametrized as follows : @xmath48 where the boundary conditions ( [ bcondtwoa ] ) and ( [ bcondtwo ] ) are understood .",

    "<S> anyon systems are studied in connection with several interesting applications including high @xmath0 superconductivity and topological quantum computing . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that these systems can be realized starting from directed polymers braided together to form a nontrivial link configuration belonging to the topological class of plats . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical sum of a such plat is related here to the partition function of a two - component anyon gas . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints that preserve the topological configuration of the plat are imposed on the polymer trajectories using the so - called gauss linking number , a topological invariant that has already been well studied in polymer physics . due to these constraints , </S>",
    "<S> short - range forces act on the monomers or , equivalently , on the anyon quasiparticles in a way that closely resembles the appearance of reaction forces in the constrained systems of classical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> if the polymers are homogeneous , the anyon system reaches a self - dual point , in which these forces vanish exactly . a class of self - dual solutions that minimize the energy of the anyons is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the two anyon gas discussed here obeys an abelian statistics , while for quantum computing it is known that nonabelian anyons are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is a limitation due to the use of the gauss linking invariant to impose the topological constraints , which is a poor topological invariant and is thus unable to capture the nonabelian characteristics of the braided polymer chains . </S>",
    "<S> a more refined treatment of the topological constraints would require more sophisticated topological invariants , but so far their application to the statistical mechanics of linked polymers is an open problem . </S>"
