    "an important constraint on the free energy expansion is that an afe phase transition may exhibit a peak or step in the @xmath23 only because of coupling between fe and afe order parameters [ 18,19 ] .",

    "we assume that local expansion around a defect may lead to noncentrosymmetric relaxations of neighboring atoms yielding a net local moment , or a multipolar set of local moments .",
    "averaged over the whole crystal , these relaxations do not generate a net macroscopic moment but local moments cause dispersion of @xmath23 .",
    "extended dipole - dipole interactions are assumed to be sufficiently weak that they can be ignored .",
    "we expand the free energy as a sum of @xmath7-independent ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath7-dependent ( @xmath67 ) contributions , @xmath68   where    @xmath69    here @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72   and @xmath73   are the bare curie temperatures for the fe and for afe phase transitions respectively , @xmath74   is external electric field , @xmath75   is the symmetrical part of the strain tensor . from the equilibrium condition with respect to @xmath75   and",
    "@xmath65   one has    @xmath76    it implies that @xmath65   multiplied by @xmath77   plays the role of the local stress and hence it effectively enlarges the local stress produced by impurities , @xmath65   proves to be proportional to the strain @xmath75 . from ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "one can easily find that @xmath75   ( as well as @xmath65 , see [ 20 ] ) is enhanced due to mutual coupling between @xmath75   and @xmath65 :    @xmath78    by using ( [ eq6 ] ) one can rewrite free energy in the simple form containing expansions only with respect to @xmath79   and @xmath80 :    @xmath81    where @xmath82   and coefficients @xmath83   and @xmath84   depend on concentration , e.g.    @xmath85    here @xmath86 .",
    "we have obtained that the coupling of the order parameter @xmath87   with the strain @xmath75   produced by the impurities leads to the dependence of the coefficients in the landau expansion on the concentration @xmath7   ( see also [ 21 ] ) .",
    "composition dependence in coefficients ( [ eq8 ] ) implies that the curie temperature also depends on @xmath7 :    @xmath88    from these expressions it is seen that if @xmath89   and @xmath90   then @xmath91   increases with @xmath7   and @xmath92   decreases with @xmath7   linearly .",
    "the latter result corresponds to the experimental data : all group ii nanbo@xmath10-based solid solutions studied exhibit a decrease in @xmath6   with @xmath7 .",
    "the assumed signs of @xmath93   and @xmath94   are natural as the electrostrictive constant @xmath93   is always positive ( if in the f one puts the sign `` - '' in front of it ) and @xmath95   should also be positive ( if one puts the sign `` + '' in front of it ) because compression of the lattice ( @xmath96 ) typically promotes afe order while the expansion ( @xmath97 ) promotes fe order .    from expansion ( [ free ] ) one can easily obtain : the critical temperature of the afe phase transition , @xmath98 ; the temperature hysteresis width , @xmath99 ; and the jump of the afe order parameter , @xmath100 :    @xmath101    from ( [ eq15 ] ) it is clear that t@xmath102   is a linear function of @xmath7 , which implies that @xmath103   is also linear at small @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to the experimentally observed linear decrease of @xmath20   with @xmath7   both above and below @xmath4   as well as explains why linear extrapolations to the point @xmath104   for various second components , intersect at one point ( fig .",
    "these points correspond to the bare curie temperatures @xmath105 .",
    "the slopes of the linear dependencies above and below @xmath106   are different as are the electrostriction constants ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "the principle experimental evidence supporting this interpretation is that the thermal hysteresis vanishes abruptly at @xmath4 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "note that we assume @xmath116   and @xmath117   but the sign  - ",
    "stands in ( [ free ] ) in front of @xmath118   and  +  precedes @xmath119 .",
    "the alternative assumption , that there is a tricritical point at ( @xmath120 , @xmath103 ) , would imply a _ gradual disappearance _ of the thermal hysteresis as @xmath7   approaches @xmath4   from below .",
    "strong @xmath7-dependence of the thermal hysteresis at @xmath121   is unusual . from ( [ eq8 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath122   increases with @xmath7 regardless of the sign of the electrostriction constant . at small @xmath7 ,",
    "this leads to a linear increase in @xmath123   while at larger @xmath7 , @xmath123   increases quadratically , in excellent agreement with experiment ( fig.4 ) .    from ( [ eq16 ] ) it follows that the jump , @xmath124q@xmath125 , in afe order parameter @xmath126   should depend on the concentration @xmath7 . because @xmath127 increases linearly with @xmath7 , so must @xmath128 .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that as @xmath7   increases , so does the difference between the magnitudes of @xmath58   measured on cooling and on heating ( fig.1 ) , which implies good agreement between theory and experiment",
    ".    our data are insufficient to identify the crystal structure of the afe phase associated with @xmath60=_finite _",
    "( @xmath129 ) but some properties are clear : @xmath23   is relaxor- like with a diffuse maximum and dispersion below @xmath6 .",
    "some properties however , are not typically relaxor- like : the dielectric permittivity magnitudes are much lower than those in typical relaxors such as pmn ; the @xmath130@xmath131   fits the curie - weiss law well above @xmath6 , but the extrapolated curie - weiss temperature , @xmath36 , is significantly below @xmath6   rather than above as in typical relaxors ; in spite of the dramatic diffusion of @xmath23 , the frequency dependence of @xmath3   and @xmath6   is much weaker than in typical relaxors . the comparatively small magnitude of @xmath57   can be connected with the absence of the large contribution of lead to the dielectric permittivity .",
    "from the discussion above it follows that one of the main reasons for the appearance of the relaxor - like properties in the nanbo@xmath10-based solid solutions belonging to group ii can be the appearance of the ( random ) local strain ( with nonvanishing average magnitude ) stemmed from the impurities . due to the electrostriction effect this results in the decrease of the afe critical temperature , increase of the thermal hysteresis width with x , and , finally , with the appearance of a new diffuse phase transition with weak dispersion of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "large diffusion of the @xmath23   maxima in some solid solution compositions with @xmath25   and the possibility of shifting @xmath6   to the room temperature range in conjunction with relatively weak frequency dependence of both @xmath6   and @xmath58   may be of certain interest for applications .",
