    "in studying the equation of state ( eos ) of ordinary quark matter , the cruial point is to treat quark confinement in a proper way . except the conventional bag mechanism",
    "( where quarks are asymptotically free within a large bag ) , an alternative way to obtain confinement is based on the density dependence of quark masses , then the proper variation of quark masses with density would mimic the strong interaction between quarks , which is the basic idea of the quark mass - density - dependent model .",
    "originally , the interaction part of the quark masses was assumed to be inversely proportional to the density  ( fowler et al .",
    "1981 ; chakrabarty 1991 ; chakrabarty 1993 ; chakrabarty 1996 ) , and this linear scaling has been extensively applied to study the properties of strange quark matter ( sqm ) . however",
    ", this class of scaling is often criticized for its absence of a convincing derivation  ( peng 2000 ) . then a cubic scaling was derived based on the in - medium chiral condensates and linear confinement  ( peng 2000 ) . and has been widely used afterwards  ( lugones @xmath1 horvath 2003 ; zheng et al . 2004 ; peng et al .",
    "2006 ; wen et al . 2007 ; peng et al . 2008 ) . but",
    "this deriving procedure is still not well justified since it took only the first order approximation of the chiral condensates in medium .",
    "incorporating of higher orders of the approximation would nontrivially complicate the quark mass formulas  ( peng 2009 ) .",
    "in fact , there are also other mass scalings in the literatures  ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ; wang 2000 ; zhang et al . 2001",
    "; zhang @xmath1 su 2002 ; zhang @xmath1 su 2003 ) .    despite the big uncertainty of the quark mass formulas , this model , after all , is no doubt only a crude approximation to qcd .",
    "for example , the model may not account for quark system where realistic quark vector interaction is non - ignorable .",
    "however , we can not get a general idea of how the strong interaction acts from the fundamental theory of strong interactions in hand , i.e. qcd .",
    "until this stimulating controversy is solved , we feel safe to take the pragmatic point of view of using the model .",
    "this work does not claim to answer how nature works .",
    "however , it may shed some light on what may happen in interesting physical situations . in this respect ,",
    "the quark mass - density - dependent model has been , and still is , an interesting laboratory .",
    "the aim of the present paper then , is to study in what extent this scaling model is allowed to study the properties of sqm . to this end",
    ", we treat the quark mass scaling as a free parameter , to investigate the stability of sqm and the variation of the predicted properties of the corresponding strange stars ( sss ) within a wide scaling range .",
    "furthermore , we try to demonstrate the general features of sss related to astrophysics observations , whatever the value of the free parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the formalism applied in calculating the eos of the sqm in the quark mass - density - dependent model . in section 3",
    "we present the structure of the stars made of this matter , including mass - radius relation , spin frequency , electric properties of the quark surface . finally in section 4",
    "we address our main conclusions .",
    "as usually done , we consider sqm as a mixture of interacting @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 quarks , and electrons , where the mass of the quarks @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is parametrized with the baryon number density @xmath7 as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a parameter to be determined by stability arguments .",
    "the density - dependent mass @xmath5 includes two parts : one is the original mass or current mass @xmath10 , the other is the interacting part @xmath11 .",
    "the exponent of density @xmath12 , i.e. the quark mass scaling , is treated as a free parameter in this paper .    denoting the fermi momentum in the phase space by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the particle number densities",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath15 and the corresponding energy density as @xmath16    the relevant chemical potentials @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 satisfy the weak - equilibrium condition ( we assume that neutrinos leave the system freely ) : @xmath21    for the quark flavor @xmath22 we have @xmath23 where @xmath24.\\ ] ] we see clearly from equ .",
    "( [ mui ] ) that since the quark masses are density dependent , the derivatives generate an additional term with respect to the free fermi gas model .    for electrons , we have @xmath25    the pressure is then given by @xmath26 with @xmath27  being the free - particle contribution : @xmath28.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the baryon number density and the charge density can be given as : @xmath29    @xmath30    the charge - neutrality condition requires @xmath31 .    solving equs .",
    "( [ weak ] ) , ( [ qmeq3 ] ) , ( [ qmeq4 ] ) , we can determine @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for a given total baryon number density @xmath7 .",
    "the other quantities are obtained straightforwardly .    in the present model ,",
    "the parameters are : the electron mass @xmath36 mev , the quark current masses @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , the confinement parameter @xmath9 and the quark mass scaling @xmath12 .",
    "although the light - quark masses are not without controversy and remain under active investigations , they are anyway very small , and so we simply take @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev . the current mass of strange quarks is @xmath42 mev according to the latest version of the particle data group  @xcite    . the stability region ( shadow region ) , is where the energy per particle is lower than 930 mev and two - flavor quark matter is unstable . , width=302 ]    we now need to establish the conditions under which the sqm is the true strong interaction ground state .",
    "that is , we must require , at @xmath43 mev for the sqm and @xmath44 mev for two - flavor quark matter ( where @xmath45 is the mass of @xmath46 ) in order not to contradict standard nuclear physics .",
    "the eos will describe stable sqm only for a set of values of ( @xmath47 ) satisfying these two conditions , which is given in fig .  1 as the `` stability window '' .",
    "only if the @xmath48 pair is in the shadow region , sqm can be absolutely stable , therefore the range of @xmath9 values is very narrow for a chosen @xmath39 value . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the allowed region decreases for decreasing value of @xmath12 . when @xmath49 it approaches to a very narrow area around @xmath9 = 199.1 mev @xmath50 .",
    "we then illustrate in fig .  2 the density dependence of @xmath11 with the quark mass scaling @xmath51 .",
    "the calculation is done with @xmath52 mev and @xmath9 values corresponding to the upper boundaries defined in fig .",
    "1 ( the same hereafter ) , that is , the system always lies in the same binding state ( for each @xmath12 ) , i.e , e / a = 930 mev .",
    "we presented those @xmath9 values in the last row of the table .  1 .",
    "clearly the quark mass varies in a very large range from very high density region ( asymptotic freedom regime ) to lower densities , where confinement ( hadrons formation ) takes place .",
    "it is compared with dey et al.s scaling ( dash - dotted )  @xcite .     with the quark mass scaling parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the calculation is done with @xmath52 mev and @xmath9 values presented in the last row of the table .  1 ( see text for details ) .",
    "it is compared with dey et al.s scaling ( dash - dotted line )  ( dey et al .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "the resulting eoss of sqm are shown in fig .  3 for all considered models .",
    "because the sound velocity @xmath53 should be smaller than @xmath54 ( velocity of light ) , unphysical region excluded by this condition has been displayed with scattered dots .",
    "for the @xmath12 values chosen here , they have quite different behavior at low density , basically falling into two sequences . at small scalings ( @xmath55 )",
    "the pressure increases rather slowly with density ; while the curve turns to rapidly increase with density at relatively large @xmath12 values ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "they cross at @xmath57 800 mev fm @xmath58 , then tend to be asymptotically linear relations at higher densities , and a larger @xmath12 value leads to a stiffer eos .",
    "meanwhile we check also the stability of such a quark matter , since some eoss in fig 3 ( @xmath59 ) are rather stiff for small pressures .",
    "we present in fig .  4 the total pressure as a function of neutron chemical potential in quark matter for all considered models , and comparison with that of typical nuclear matter ( obtained from the brueckner - hartree - fock approach  @xcite ) . we see clearly from the figure that the quark matter tends to be more stable than nuclear matter for all considered models .",
    "the behavior of eoss would be mirrored at the prediction of mass - radius relations of the corresponding sss , as is shown in the fig .",
    "5 . for the first sequence ,",
    "the maximum mass occurs at a low central density ( as shown in table .",
    "[ table1 ] ) , so a higher maximum mass is obtained due to a stiffer eos , and with the increase of @xmath12 value , the maximum mass is reduced from 1.78@xmath0 at @xmath60 down to 1.61 @xmath0 at @xmath61 ; while we observe a slight increase of the maximum mass with @xmath12 value for the second sequence : from 1.56@xmath0 at @xmath62 up to 1.62 @xmath0 at @xmath63 .",
    "anyway the resulting maximum mass lies between 1.5@xmath0 and 1.8@xmath0 for a rather wide range of @xmath12 value chosen here ( 0.1  3 ) , which may be a pleasing feature of this model : well - controlled . to see the region of stellar parameters allowed by this model , we plot in fig .  5 also the m(r ) curves for lower boundaries defined in fig .  1 for @xmath64 with grey lines",
    ".    the radii , on the other hand , decrease invariably with @xmath12 value . employing the empirical formula connecting the maximum rotation frequency with the maximum mass and radius of the static configuration  @xcite",
    ", we get also the maximum rotational angular frequency @xmath65 as @xmath66rad s@xmath67 . as a result",
    ", a larger @xmath12 value results in a larger maximum spin frequency , sss with @xmath63 can rotate at a frequency of @xmath68 = 2194 hz .",
    "more detailed results can be found in table .",
    "[ table1 ] .    .calculated results for the gravitational masses , radii , central baryon densities ( normalized to the saturation density of nuclear matter , @xmath69 = 0.17 fm@xmath58 ) , and the maximum rotational frequencies for the maximum - mass stars of each strange star sequence .",
    "the calculation is done with @xmath52 mev and @xmath9 values presented in the last row of this table . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]              are presented with grey lines .",
    "contours of the maximum rotation frequencies are given by the light grey curves  ( gourgoulhon et al .",
    ", width=302 ]    in addition , the surface electric field could be very strong near the bare quark surface of a strange star because of the mass difference of the strange quark and the up ( or down ) quark , which could play an important role in producing the thermal emission of bare strange stars by the usov mechanism  ( usov 1998 ; usov 2001 ) .",
    "the strong electric field is also very crucial in forming a possible crust around a strange star , which has been investigated extensively by many authors  ( for a recent development , see zdunik et al .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that this electric field may have some important implications on pulsar radio emission mechanisms  ( xu et al .",
    "therefore it is very worthwhile to explore how the mass scaling influences the surface electric field of the stars , and possible related astronomical observations in turn may drop a hint on what the proper mass scaling would be .    adopting a simple thomas - fermi model ,",
    "one gets the poisson s equation  ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the height above the quark surface , @xmath73 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath74 is the quark charge density inside the quark surface .",
    "together with the physical boundary conditions @xmath75 , and the continuity of @xmath76 at @xmath77 requires @xmath78 , the solution for @xmath79 finally leads to @xmath80 the electron charge density can be calculated as @xmath81 , therefore the number density of the electrons is @xmath82 and the electric field above the quark surface is finally @xmath83 which is directed outward .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "5 ( take @xmath61 for example ) that although the electric field near the surface is about @xmath84 v cm@xmath67 , the outward electric field decreases very rapidly above the quark surface , and at @xmath86 cm , the field gets down to @xmath87 v cm@xmath67 , which is of the order of the rotation - induced electric field for a typical goldreich - julian magnetosphere . to change",
    "the mass scaling mainly has two effects : first , it affects a lot the surface electric field , and a small scaling parameter leads to an enhanced electric field",
    ". the weakening of electric field would be almost a order of magnitude large ( from @xmath88 v cm@xmath67 to @xmath89 v cm@xmath67 ) , which may have some effect on astronomical observations .",
    "second , a larger scaling would slow the decrease of the electric field above the quark surface .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the stability of sqm within a wide scaling range , i.e. from 0.1 to 3 .",
    "we study also the properties of the sss made of the matter .",
    "the calculation shows that the resulting maximum mass always lies between 1.5@xmath0 and 1.8@xmath0 for all the mass scalings chosen here .",
    "strange star sequences with a linear scaling would support less gravitational mass , a change ( increase or decrease ) of the scaling parameter around the linear scaling would result in a higher maximum mass .",
    "radii invariably decrease with the mass scaling .",
    "then the larger the scaling , the faster the star rotates .",
    "in addition , the variation of the scaling may cause an order of magnitude change of the surface electric field , which may have some effect on astronomical observations .",
