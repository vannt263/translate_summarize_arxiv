    "the last decade has seen a remarkable increase in our knowledge of the bottom of the stellar main - sequence and of the low - mass stellar and sub - stellar ( brown dwarf ) population of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "two new classes have been added to the spectral type sequence following m : l and t ( e.g. kirkpatrick 2005 ) .",
    "t dwarfs with effective temperatures ( @xmath1 ) as low as @xmath12500  k are now known ( warren et al .",
    "2007 , burningham et al .",
    "2008 , delorme et al .",
    "2008a , leggett et al . 2009 ) and we are truly finding objects that provide the link between the low - mass stars and the giant planets .",
    "the very late - type t dwarf discoveries are primarily a result of the red and near - infrared wide - field surveys : the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al . 2007 ) , and the canada france hawaii telescope s brown dwarf survey ( cfbds ; delorme et al .",
    "late - type t dwarfs have also been found as companions to stars in infrared imaging data ( mugrauer et al .",
    "2006 , luhman et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "interestingly , despite the great success of recent surveys , there are currently less than half the number of t dwarfs known than there are extrasolar planets ; _",
    "_ lists 155 t dwarfs as opposed to the 407 exoplanets listed at _",
    "exoplanet.eu_ , as of december 2009 .",
    "an increase in the number of known t dwarfs is expected , due to the ongoing cfbds and ukidss surveys , and other imminent ground - based near - infrared surveys , such as the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista , mcpherson et al .",
    "also , as @xmath1 decreases brown dwarfs emit significant flux at mid - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2003 , leggett et al . 2009 ) and it is expected that the recently launched wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , liu et al .",
    "2008 ) will detect a significant number of cold brown dwarfs in its 2.8  3.8 , 4.1  5.2 and 7.5  16.5  @xmath2 m bands .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates the rapidly increasing importance of the mid - infrared region for late - type t dwarfs ; for dwarfs cooler than 700  k more than half the flux is emitted at wavelengths longer than 3  @xmath2 m .",
    "this paper investigates photometric trends seen in very late - type dwarfs at mid - infrared wavelengths , with the expectation that these longer wavelengths will be crucial for both the discovery and the understanding of the coolest t - type dwarfs , and even more so for the proposed cooler y - type dwarfs ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "we were awarded time on the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al . 2004 ) to follow up at mid - infrared wavelengths late - type t dwarfs found by ukidss . in this paper",
    "we present new 3  8  @xmath2 m photometry of ukidss dwarfs obtained with irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as previously unpublished irac photometry from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "we combine these data with previously published near- and mid - infrared photometry to examine trends in colors with type , which will be useful for the design and use of ongoing and planned infrared surveys .",
    "we also examine in detail the colors of the @xmath13  k @xmath14 dwarfs for correlations with the photospheric parameters temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "we find that various colors do provide useful indicators of temperature and gravity , which in turn provide estimates of mass and age ( from evolutionary models ) for these , usually isolated , very low mass objects .",
    "figure 2 shows spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a t8 dwarf with @xmath15  k and a t9 dwarf with @xmath16  k. principal absorption features are indicated and it can be seen that the flux from cool brown dwarfs emerges from windows between strong bands of , primarily , ch@xmath17 and h@xmath18o absorption .",
    "as the temperature drops from 750  k to 600  k the ratio of the mid- to the near - infrared flux increases dramatically , and more flux emerges through the windows centered near 5  @xmath2 m and 10  @xmath2 m .",
    "passbands are indicated for the near - infrared @xmath19 system used here , as well as the four irac bands and three shortest - wavelength wise bands .",
    "the irac and wise filters sample regions of high flux , as well as regions of strong absorption where very little flux is emitted .",
    "thus both cameras are sensitive to cold brown dwarfs , which can be identified by extreme colors in their photometric systems .",
    "atmospheric and evolutionary models used in this analysis were generated by members of our team ( marley et al .",
    "2002 , saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "the atmospheric models include all the significant sources of gas opacity ( freedman et al .",
    "however there are known deficiencies in the molecular opacity line lists . for ch@xmath17 , the list effectively contains no lines below 1.6@xmath20 m . for nh@xmath21",
    ", there are no lines below 1.4@xmath20 m in our data base .",
    "the feh line list is known to be incomplete for the @xmath22@xmath23 transition in the 1.2 ",
    "1.3@xmath20 m region ( cushing et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this is not a concern for this study however as feh bands disappear by the l7 spectral type ( cushing , rayner & vacca 2005 ) and are completely absent in late - type t dwarfs .",
    "finally , our treatment of the red wing of the pressure broadened k i resonance doublet ( 0.78@xmath20 m ) does not properly reproduce the observations in the 0.8 - 1.1@xmath20 m range .",
    "condensates of certain refractory elements are included in atmospheric layers where physical conditions favor such condensation .",
    "variations in condensate cloud properties are treated in these models using a sedimentation parameter @xmath24 which is the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the convective velocity ( ackerman & marley 2001 ) .",
    "small values of @xmath24 represent thick clouds with small grain sizes , and large values represent thin clouds with larger grains .",
    "the cloud decks impact the flux emitted in the near- infrared wavelength region for early - type l to early - type t dwarfs .",
    "cloud - free models best fit the spectra of later - type , cooler , objects and we employ such models here . in reality condensates",
    "certainly form deep in the atmospheres of such cool t dwarfs but a combination of atmospheric dynamics and cloud physics results in a negligible spectral influence from clouds at these effective temperatures .",
    "we generally find that the colors and spectra of l dwarfs are reproduced with @xmath24 @xmath25  2 , while those of later t dwarfs are reproduced with @xmath24 @xmath26 or cloud - free ( @xmath27 ) models ( e.g. knapp et al .",
    "2004 ; stephens et al . 2009 ) .",
    "our models also include vertical transport in the atmosphere , which significantly affects the chemical abundances of c- , n- and o - bearing species .",
    "the very stable molecules co and n@xmath18 are dredged up from deep layers to the photosphere faster than they can reach chemical equilibrium with ch@xmath17 and nh@xmath21 , respectively , causing enhanced abundances of these species and decreased abundances of ch@xmath17 , h@xmath18o , and nh@xmath21 ( e.g. fegley & lodders 1996 , hubeny & burrows 2007 , saumon et al .",
    "vertical transport is parameterized in our models by an eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath28 ( @xmath29 s@xmath30 ) which is related to the mixing time scale .",
    "generally , larger values of @xmath28 imply greater enhancement of co and n@xmath18 over ch@xmath17 and nh@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "values of @xmath31  6 , corresponding to mixing time scales of @xmath32  yr to @xmath33  h respectively , reproduce the observations of t dwarfs ( e.g. leggett et al . 2007b , saumon et al .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath28 has a large influence on the 4.6 @xmath2 m and 9  15 @xmath2 m fluxes for both l and t dwarfs : increasing @xmath28 leads to increased co and an increase in the co absorption at 4.6 @xmath2 m , and to decreased nh@xmath21 and so a decrease in the 9  15 @xmath2 m nh@xmath21 absorption ( e.g. stephens et al .",
    "models which do not include mixing , usually referred to as chemical equilibrium models , do not reproduce observations , especially at these wavelengths .",
    "the evolutionary sequences of saumon & marley ( 2008 ) provide radius , mass , and age for a variety of atmospheric parameters .",
    "these have been computed with both cloudy ( @xmath34 ) and cloudless models as the surface - boundary condition .",
    "the primary sample for this paper consists of t dwarfs with spectral types t7 and later , as defined by the burgasser et al .",
    "( 2006b ) scheme .",
    "very few of these are currently known  26 are listed in the _ dwarfarchives.org _",
    "compendium at the time of writing .",
    "the latest spectral type currently defined is t9 , of which three are currently known : ulas j003402.77 - 005206.7 ( hereafter ulas 0034 - 00 ; warren et al .",
    "2007 ) , cfbds j005910.90 - 011401.3 ( cfbds 0059 - 00 ; delorme et al . 2008a ) and ulas j133553.45 + 113005.2 ( ulas 1335 + 11 ; burningham et al .",
    "the discovery papers provide new spectral indices for typing such extreme t dwarfs , as the burgasser et al .",
    "indices measure absorption regions that show little change beyond @xmath12t8 types .",
    "figure 2 shows that very little flux remains to be absorbed at the near - infrared ch@xmath17 bands , for t8 and t9 dwarfs .",
    "the _ spitzer _ general observer programs 40449 and 60093 , and the director s time program 527 , allowed us to obtain irac photometry of apparently very late - type t dwarfs discovered in the ukidss data , that had an estimated brightness of [ 4.5 ] @xmath35 16.5 magnitudes .",
    "the cycle 4 target of opportunity program and the director s time program provided photometry in all four irac bands , while the cycle 6 warm mission program provides only photometry at the shortest two wavelengths .",
    "all targets observed were found in the large area survey ( las ) component of the ukidss .",
    "the las will cover 3800 deg@xmath36 of the sky in the @xmath19 filters to @xmath37 ( vega magnitudes , @xmath38 ) , with a large degree of overlap with existing sdss optical data .",
