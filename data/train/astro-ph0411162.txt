    "i m nor is a _ recurrent nova _ ( rn ) , that was observed in outburst in 1920 and again on 2002 january 3 ( elliot & liller 1972 , liller 2002a ) . assuming that the maximum occurred on 2002 january 14 , at v=7.84 ( liller 2002b ; note that a successive measurement v=7.66 on january 16 was done through fog and had a large error bar , liller 2002c ) , the times to decay by 2 and 3 magnitudes , respectively , were in the ranges t@xmath5=21 - 26 days and t@xmath6=45 - 74 days ( pearce 2002 , shida 2002 ) .",
    "an approximate value t@xmath7 50 days is derived from the vsnet light curve by kato et al .",
    "these times are longer than for most rn , with the exceptions of t pyx ( webbink et al .",
    "1986 and references therein ) and ci aql ( kiss et al .",
    "the fwhm of the emission lines was 1150 km s@xmath2 , indicating moderately high ejection velocities ( drbeck et al .",
    "i m nor is the only known rn classified as a `` fe ii nova '' ( see retter et al . 2002 , drbeck et al . 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "another peculiarity is that i m nor may have ejected significantly more mass than all other rn , except ci aql ( see retter et al .",
    "2002 , and discussion below ) .",
    "classical novae are thought to be recurrent over time scales @xmath81000 years , while rn undergo inter - outburst periods of only @xmath9100 years .",
    "the reason seems to be due to a more massive white dwarf ( hereafter , wd ) than in the average classical nova system , and in some cases higher mass accretion rate ( see early work by fujimoto 1982 and prialnik et al .",
    "1982 , for the dependence of inter - outburst time on physical parameters of the system ) .",
    "rn are interesting as possible progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "a list of publications on the subjects includes starrfield et al .",
    "( 1985 , 1988 ) , livio & truran ( 1994 ) , della valle & livio ( 1996 ) , hachisu & kato ( 2000 ) .",
    "there are basically two types of rn , long period systems hosting a red giant , and typical cataclysmic variables with only a slightly evolved secondary . for the latter group ,",
    "orbital periods seem to be either very short compared to other novae ( 2 - 3 hours ) , or quite long ( 10 - 24 hours ) .",
    "i m nor has a short orbital period , 2.46 hours ( woudt & warner 2003 )    novae at quiescence are x - ray sources because of accretion , but they are faint ( orio et al .",
    "2002 ) . after an outburst ,",
    "they turn into more luminous x - ray sources , initially because of shocks in the ejected shell ( e.g. , in colliding winds , or phenomena between ejecta and circumstellar matter ) . thermal bremsstrahlung emission is detected at temperatures in the range 0.1 - 10 kev , and at late phases emission lines have also been detected in the 0.2 - 1.0 kev energy range .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the 0.2 - 10 kev range is l@xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ( see orio 2004 for a review ) .",
    "if the central wd keeps on burning un - ejected hydrogen , which has interesting implications related to the final fate of nova systems , then novae appear as luminous supersoft x - ray sources with bolometric luminosities in the range l@xmath1210@xmath13 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the wd atmosphere is extremely hot , ( t@xmath14 k ) , and directly observable when the ejecta become optically thin to supersoft x - rays .    in this case , the atmospheric absorption edges and many narrow and crowded absorption lines are detected and , for the most luminous objects , can be resolved with grating observations in x - rays ( e.g. , ness et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the galaxy only @xmath1520% of all classical and recurrent novae were observed as supersoft x - ray sources for more than a few months ( see orio 2004 ) .",
    "the length of the supersoft x - ray phase is an indication of the amount of hydrogen fuel left over after each outburst , hence the likelihood that the white dwarf mass grows towards the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the nature of type ia sn progenitors is still an open question , but single degenerate close binary systems , and among them especially rn , are thought to contribute significantly to the type ia sn rate ( e.g. starrfield et al .",
    "if not all the accreted material is ejected and the wd mass grows after repeated outbursts , rn can be considered the most likely progenitors of type ia sn among novae and cv ( it is crucial however to estimate the abundances , because one needs to rule out the possibility that eroded wd material , instead of freshly accreted material , is being burned ) .",
    "della valle & livio ( 1996 ) argued that the specific contribution of rn to the type ia sn rate is not high .",
    "the discovery of i m nor and of another rn , ci aql , in outburst in 2001 , may change these conclusions .",
    "a long decay time is thought to indicate a large envelope mass . in both these two unusual rn , the empirical relationship between t@xmath5 and and ejected mass @xmath16m@xmath17 of della valle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) yields @xmath16m@xmath17 of order of 10@xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "theoretically , hachisu et al . ( 2003 ) estimate instead an envelope mass @xmath16m@xmath20=8 @xmath21 m@xmath19 for ci aql . in the models , for reasons that are not clear yet , an order of magnitude smaller @xmath16m@xmath17",
    "is commonly predicted than it is inferred from the observations ( e.g. gehrz et al .",
    "however , even this lower theoretical value is much higher than those estimated for most other rn . if the retained mass after the outburst was a significant fraction of the ejected amount , then these two objects may be representative of a class of rn which accumulate enough material on the wd despite ejection during outbursts , to grow towards the chandrasekhar mass in a time that is sufficiently short to have an impact on the type ia sn rate .",
    "this class probably includes t pyx , whose outbursts do not seem to be recurrent any more on a fixed time scale , but are also very long - lasting . for comparison u sco , a non - red giant rn system in which the decline of the optical light curve was instead very rapid , ejected only about 10@xmath22 m@xmath23(williams et al .",
    "u sco appeared as a supersoft x - ray source already 20 days after the outburst ( kahabka et al .",
    "this rapid evolution indicates a massive white dwarf , which ejects little accreted mass , but still retains part of it after the outburst .",
    "u sco was not observed again in x - rays , so there is no estimate of the total amount of retained mass .",
    "optical studies suggest , however , that only a small amount of mass was ejected , just what is required to trigger the nova explosion on a massive wd ( starrfield et al .",
    "if part of the envelope is retained after rn outbursts , then the rn with unusually large envelope masses are of great interest for type ia sn theories because their wd may grow rapidly to reach the chandrasekhar mass .    despite the unusually large optical luminosity ,",
    "which is thought to indicate ongoing thermonuclear burning , t pyx has not been detected as a supersoft x - ray source ( greiner et al .",
    "2003 ) , but it was observed only about 30 years after the last outburst . since the optical light curve of ci aql evolved slowly ( t@xmath5=30@xmath241 days and t@xmath6=36@xmath241 days , kiss et al .",
    "2001 ) , x - ray observations were done only more than a year after the outburst , with the working hypothesis that the evolution in x - rays would be as slow as the optical , and that h - burning would also last longer .",
    "however , x - ray emission was only detected from the ejecta and not from the central source ( greiner and di stefano 2002 ) .",
    "we asked to perform _ chandra acis - s _ x - ray observations of i m nor at much earlier epochs than those done for ci aql , approximately 1 and 6 months post - outburst .",
    "the first observation was done during the ddt ( director s discretionary time ) with the comparison with u sco in mind .",
    "the second observation was done in the framework of an accepted target of opportunity ( too ) program , based on the optical spectrum having become nebular ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the date of the first observation was 2002 february 12 , almost 4 weeks after optical maximum , with an exposure of 5630 s. the data were analysed with the _ ciao _ software for _ chandra _ data analysis .",
    "one month post - outburst u sco had already became an x - ray supersoft source , and all observed novae were x - ray sources due to shell emission ( see orio 2004 ) .",
    "i m nor however was not detected in this early observation , with an upper limit on the _ acis - s _ count rate of 0.0014 cts s@xmath2 in the 0.2 - 10 kev range .",
    "the value of the equivalent column density of neutral hydrogen , n(h ) in the direction of the nova obtained from the _ nh _ program included in nasa s _ ftools _ ( based on the maps of dickey & lockman , 1990 ) yields an average n(h)=8.15 @xmath25 @xmath26 in a cone of 1@xmath27 radius in the direction of the nova , although there is a rather large uncertainty . assuming a blackbody at t=30 ev ( e.g. , orio et al .",
    "1999 ) , and conservatively a rather large value n(h)=10@xmath28 @xmath26 ( which would imply some intrinsic absorption of the ejecta ) this limit in the count rate translates into an upper limit to the x - ray flux at 0.2 - 10 kev , f@xmath2910@xmath30 erg @xmath26 s@xmath2 .",
    "the flux upper limit is instead f@xmath31 10@xmath30 erg @xmath26 s@xmath2 , assuming instead a thermal plasma at kt=3 kev and n(h)=10@xmath32 @xmath26 ( appropriate for for nebular x - ray emission after a month , e.g. , mukai & ishida 2001 ) .",
    "these fluxes correspond to x - ray luminosity l@xmath33 = 1.2 and 4.8 @xmath34 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "optical spectra of i m nor were obtained on 2002 april 29.40  ut on the noao ctio blanco 4-m telescope using the ritchey - chretien spectrograph ( @xmath35 ) with the blue air schmidt camera and the loral thinned 3k @xmath36 1k format ccd ( woodward et al . 2002 ) . a 527 line mm@xmath2 grating ( kpgl3 ) resulted in a dispersion of 1.91   pixel@xmath2 .",
    "all spectra were obtained with a 13 wide slit and a uv ( wg360 ; 3600  ) blocking filter to reduce second - order contamination in the red .",
    "complete details of observational and reduction techniques can be found in skillman et al .",
    "one of three spectra is shown in fig . 1 .      due to the contamination of the h @xmath37 line by the [ n ii ] line , and to the contamination of h @xmath38 by the [ o iii ] line",
    ", we can only estimate the value of e(b  v ) with very large uncertainty .",
    "measuring the equivalent width of the na i line at 5890 yields an approximate value e(b  v)@xmath151.1 using the empirical relationship of della valle & duerbeck ( 1993 ) , but we caution that another empirical relationship given by barbon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) yields only e(b  v)@xmath150.50 .",
    "following ryter et al .",
    "( 1975 ) we obtain n(h)@xmath39 @xmath26 in the first case , and only n(h)@xmath40 @xmath26 in the second . in any case",
    ", these values do not exceed the one indicated from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , and therefore we do not find evidence of intrinsic nebular reddening .",
    "this conclusion is definitely strengthened by the ratio of h@xmath41/h@xmath42 , which is known to be 0.26 in stationary conditions ( when this ratio depends only on the recombination ratio ) .",
    "intrinsic nebular reddening would cause a lower value to be measured .",
    "this ratio in our case is instead 0.51 , which implies that optical depth effect and collisions changed the recombination ratios , and that we were able to observe the spectrum where such effects occur .",
    "we came to the conclusion that intrinsic nebular reddening is absent and should not be added to the interstellar value . in other words , the nebular material was already optically thin at the date of this observation .",
    "the distance to i m nor is not known , and the distances to rn in general are difficult to evaluate . for a classical nova , having an estimate of the reddening and of t@xmath5 we should be able to derive the distance from the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relationship ( mmrd ) .",
    "however , even if some rn , such as t crb , rs oph and v745 sco , seem to follow the mmrd , warner ( 1995 ) notes that for t pyx the mmrd yields d=2.1 kpc while the nebular parallax indicates d=1 kpc .",
    "moreover , observations of rn in m31 ( capaccioli et al . 1989 ) and lmc ( capaccioli et al . 1990 ) show that they are often 1 - 2 mag fainter than predicted by the mmrd .",
    "woudt & warner ( 2003 ) also note that the light curves of both ci aql and i m nor are different from that of classical novae and that a correction to the mmrd relationship must be necessary . adopting the mmrd of della valle & livio ( 1995 , but subtracting 1 magnitude from the value of the absolute magnitude at maximum , and using e(b - v)=1.1",
    ", we obtain a distance range 3.84 .",
    "kpc for t@xmath5=21 - 26 d , however with e(b - v)=0.50 obtained with the barbon et al .",
    "relationship , we obtain 1.5 - 1.6 kpc .",
    "since i m nor was a rn with a relatively massive envelope and did not eject as little mass as u sco , the correction to the mmrd may be even much less than 1 magnitude , and an absolute upper limit can be considered d=6.4 kpc , obtained without correction to the mmrd .",
    "1.5 - 6.4 kpc is a large range , so we will continue to parameterize the luminosity as a function of the distance .",
    "i m nor was detected in x - rays when it was observed again for 4930 s with _ acis - s _ 6 months after the outburst , on 2002 may 31 .",
    "we knew that the nebula was optically thin to supersoft x - rays by this time , but the x - ray source was neither `` super - soft '' nor very luminous . further _",
    "grating observations guaranteed for the too program in case of a bright nova were not scheduled , because only very low s / n would have been achieved .",
    "the hard x - ray emission most likely originated in the ejected nebula ( see orio 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the measured count rate was 0.267@xmath240.008 cts s@xmath2 , a factor of 30 higher than for ci aql 16 months after the outburst .",
    "the observations span about 59% of the orbital period , but we can not detect , nor rule out variability on time scales shorter than the observation time . the background corrected count rate varies only within a 2 @xmath43 error .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the _ chandra acis - s _ x - ray spectrum and one possible model fit ( see table 1 and discussion below ) . at this stage",
    "i m nor was a harder x - ray source than ci aql , which is expected for an earlier cooling stage of the shell . we fitted the spectrum with several models available in the _ xspec _ software package ( arnaud et al .",

    "does not yield a good fit ( @xmath44/dof=2.5 ) .",
    "with the _ mekal _ model we could fit the spectrum only by allowing the metalicity parameter , z , to vary .",
    "we find a reasonable fit with a very low value , z@xmath150 .",
    "to better test the effect of the chemical composition , we tried the _",
    "vmekal _ and the _ vraymond _ models , which include abundances of several elements .",
    "we allowed the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , ca , fe and ni to vary freely .",
    "we obtained the best fits in both models with enhanced c and o , and depleted fe .",
    "the most outstanding abundances are c / c@xmath23=160 , n / n@xmath23=188 , fe / fe@xmath640 for _ vmekal _ , and close values were obtained using",
    "_ vraymond_. with _ vraymond _ , the fit is slightly improved with he / he@xmath23@xmath450.002 , but low he abundance is not required fitting with the _ vmekal _ model .",
    "these results are surprising ( especially for iron , because i m nor was a fe ii nova ) but not conclusive .",
    "first of all , it is possible to fit the spectrum even better with solar abundances , by adding an additional component ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , there may be non - ionization equilibrium conditions ( see discussion by mukai & ishida , 2001 , for nova v382 vel , for which iron was not detected in the x - ray spectrum ) .    as a next step , we tried fitting composite models .",
    "we added a black - body component to the thermal plasma , and obtained the best fit of all ( @xmath44/dof=0.95 , see fig .",
    "the blackbody fit at t@xmath65 = 70 ev is obtained with a constant proportional to the bolometric luminosity and inversely proportional to the distance , and in our fit l@xmath66 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( note that t@xmath67 ev is ruled out by the spectral fits ) .",
    "this value of the bolometric luminosity , for any value of the distance , is orders of magnitudes lower than observed for supersoft x - ray sources ( see review by orio , 2004 ) .",
    "thus , a blackbody component is likely to exist , but we are not observing the atmospheric emission of a significant portion of the surface of a hot , hydrogen burning white dwarf .",
    "the residuals in the fits ( see fig . 1 ) are suggestive of emission lines , like those observed previously for nova v382 vel ( burwitz et al .",
    "additonal narrow gaussian components at @xmath151 and @xmath151.2 kev , where residuals appear in the model fit , do not fit the data . adding a gaussian component at 1.94 kev ( possibly due to a ni xvi line ) to the bremsstrahlung model",
    ", we improved the fit to some extent , although we did not improve it further adding more gaussian components .",
    "the low spectral resolution prevents a very thorough investigation of how emission lines may be altering the observed spectrum .",
    "all the spectral fits in table 1 yield unabsorbed flux f@xmath33=1.2 - 2.4 @xmath36 10@xmath47 erg @xmath26 s@xmath2 , and l@xmath68 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 . from the values of the emission measure we derive electron density n@xmath69 @xmath60 for d@xmath15 4",
    "kpc , if all the shell volume is filled .",
    "we also tried fitting a two component thermal plasma , the last in table 1 , which could originate in different clumps or layers of the ejected nebula and therefore differently absorbed . using the _ raymond - smith _",
    "model for both , we find a heavily absorbed component at low temperature , filling a fraction of at least a 10th of the ejected shell .",
    "the absorbed flux in this model would be 1.8 @xmath70 erg @xmath26 s@xmath2 , corresponding to the high unabsorbed flux f@xmath33=6.1 @xmath71 erg @xmath26 s@xmath2 .",
    "however , the conclusions we derived from the optical spectrum rule out this component because of the high value n(h)=3.2 @xmath72 @xmath26 .",
    "the upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of i m nor a month after the outburst is unprecedented , because all classical and recurrent novae that were observed at early post - outburst epochs showed x - ray emission at l@xmath73 erg s@xmath2 much earlier than after one month ( see review by orio , 2004 ) .",
    "half a year after the outburst the nova was detected as an x - ray source .",
    "hard x - ray emission from the ejecta , with l@xmath74 erg s@xmath2 , was the dominant component in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "a blackbody component is also likely present in the x - ray spectrum of i m nor , at high temperature , t@xmath75 70 ev , but at such low luminosity , l@xmath76 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , that does not fit the observed characteristics of the supersoft x - ray sources in novae , and it is likely to have another origin , possibly a hot spot on the wd surface .    did we observe i m nor too early , when the supersoft emitting hot wd atmosphere was absorbed by the intrinsic column density of the ejecta ? even if the spectral fits do not allow to rule this out completely , because of the high value of n(h ) for the first component of the double raymond - smith model in table 1 , the optical spectrum of the nova observed a month earlier shows that the ejecta were optically thin 5 months after the outburst .",
    "it is very unlikely that we had significant intrinsic absorption even a month later .",
    "therefore nuclear burning switched off , or was in the process of switching off , six months after the outburst .",
    "it takes about a year to terminate thermonuclear burning completely ( prialnik 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the mass burning rate for stable hydrogen thermonuclear burning in the accreted shell is a few 10@xmath22 m@xmath23 year@xmath2 , and the burnt mass must be added to the non - burnt mass .",
    "there is in fact a minimum mass necessary to sustain shell hydrogen burning , which is m@xmath77 m@xmath23 for the expected wd mass in rn , m@xmath78 1 m@xmath23 ( fujimoto 1982 ) .",
    "this implies that the leftover mass after about 80 years of recurrence time , does not exceed @xmath79 m@xmath23 .",
    "if 80 years is the average period between outburst , i m nor accretes 0.1 m@xmath23 in about 10@xmath80 years , 10 times longer than the typical time scale assumed by della valle & livio ( 1996 ) to accumulate this mass in a rn . since these authors found that even with an order of magnitude shorter time scale rn do not contribute significantly to type ia sn explosions , at least assuming the chandrasekhar mass model for the outburst , rn like i m nor , hitherto thought to be the best candidate progenitor , appear to contribute at most in a negligible way to the type ia sn rate .",
    "even if some outbursts were missed notwithstanding the long decline , the conclusion does not change because with such little leftover mass , the interoutburst time would need to be of the order of one year to make i m nor a `` statistically significant '' sn ia candidate .",
    "we do not rule out that some rn may become type ia sn , but our result strenghtens and makes more compelling the conclusion of della valle & livio ( 1996 ) : the path of a rn to type ia sn takes such a long time that rn can not contribute significantly to the sn ia rate .",
    "at least another class of progenitor other than rn is needed to explain the observed type ia sn rate .",

    "<S> it was not detected in the first observation , with an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity in the 0.2 - 10 kev range l@xmath0 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( where d is the distance to the nova ) . </S>",
    "<S> five months later , a hard x - ray source with l@xmath3 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 was detected . the x - ray spectrum appears to be thermal , but we can not rule out additional components due to unresolved emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> a blackbody component is likely to contribute to the observed spectrum , but it has bolometric luminosity l@xmath4 ( d/1 kpc)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , therefore it is not sufficiently luminous to be due to a central white dwarf which is still burning hydrogen on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> an optical spectrum , taken 5 months post - outburst , indicates no intrinsic reddening of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the shell had already become optically thin to supersoft x - rays , but nuclear burning had already turned off , or was in the process of turning off at this time . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss why this implies that recurrent novae , even the rare ones with long optical decays like i m nor , indicating a large envelope mass , are not statistically significant as type ia sn candidates . </S>"
