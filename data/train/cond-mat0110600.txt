    "within the scope of special functions , kelvin functions appear early in the literature @xcite @xcite .",
    "they are derived from the bessel functions @xcite of complex argument and many formulas can be found .",
    "in addition to their importance in mathematics they have , also , a broad spectrum of application in physics . for instance , in the analysis of the current distribution in cylindrical conductors due to wave propagation @xcite .",
    "a more interesting application is the problem of determining the equivalent impedance of a cylindrical conductor which is given in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "kelvin functions also arose in the problem of the wave  impedance of cylindrically layered conductors for application in nondestructive testing @xcite .",
    "the temperature distribution in cylindrical conductors due to an alternative current also involves @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "kelvin functions also appear in other fields ( i.e. , fluid mechanics ) but in this paper we will concentrate on the first electromagnetic application mentioned above .",
    "one of the problems we have found in the applications of kelvin functions is that their behaviour is rather complicated .",
    "kelvin functions are oscillatory and the amplitude of the oscillations increases rapidly . in spite of the already existing tables ,",
    "still the functions are part of integrands where the tables are difficult to use .",
    "the programs to compute these functions are also too elaborated .",
    "it seems convenient to have a good approximation to the functions , but the conventional approximation methods do not give good results because of the pathological behaviour of the functions .",
    "however , in this paper it is shown how those difficulties can be surmounted by using the recently published method of two  point quasifractional approximations @xcite @xcite .",
    "this has allowed us to find analytic approximations to kelvin functions with good accuracy , and furthermore , the same analytic approximation is valid for the whole range of positive values of the variable .    power series and asymptotic expansions are required in order to obtain these approximations , thus we start analysing those expansions to proceed further away .",
    "this will be done in sec .",
    "2 , where the form of the approximation will be also derived . later",
    ", the material of this paper will be arranged as follows : the calculation of the parameters for the two  point quasifractional approximation of @xmath3 is carried out in sec .",
    "4 devotes its attention to the analysis of the results of the approximation .",
    "the same procedure applied to @xmath3 in previous sections is employed in the calculation of @xmath4 .",
    "that calculation and the discussion of the results obtained for @xmath4 are performed in sec .",
    "5 . in sec .",
    "6 we show an immediate application to engineering .",
    "finally , sec . 7 aims its attention to discussion and conclusions of the paper .",
    "as it is well known , the real kelvin function is defined as @xcite    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "the power series is given by    @xmath7    the asymptotic expansion of @xmath8 has been also given in several references .",
    "our interest here is mainly in the leading term , which can be written as    @xmath9    once the potential series ( [ ber - series ] ) and the asymptotic expansion ( [ ber - asymp ] ) have been obtained , it is possible to determine the form of the quasifractional approximations of the function @xmath3 , which has an essential singularity at infinity .",
    "that kind of singularity is characteristic of all the hypergeometric confluent functions .",
    "the asymptotic expansion ( [ ber - asymp ] ) picks up this singularity and shows it up through a branch point at infinity together with essential singularities at infinity of the exponential functions .",
    "since the branch points come up in pairs , the leading term of the asymptotic expansion shows also a second branch point at @xmath10",
    ". however , the behaviour of the function @xmath0 is regular at @xmath10 , therefore the asymptotic form in ( [ ber - asymp ] ) is not suitable as an approximation for @xmath0 in the region near zero . in order to pursue the goal of picking up the right behaviour at infinity , but not to introduce undesired singularities in the zone of interest",
    ", a suitable auxiliary function has to be chosen .",
    "the auxiliary function should have the right ramification form at infinity , and the second branch point located outside the zone of interest ( i.e. , the negative axis )    only powers of the form @xmath11 appear in the potential series of @xmath0 . in order to achieve the adequate efficency in the approximation",
    ", we should find such auxiliary functions and fractional approximations whose potential series only have exponents multiple of @xmath12 .    since the second branch point introduced with the asymptotic expansion must be outside the zone of interest , it is possible to choose as an auxiliary function @xmath13 ; however , that auxiliary function would not be efficient , since undesired power terms as @xmath14 would appear",
    ". a more suitable auxiliary function would be @xmath15{1+x^4}$ ] or @xmath16 { 1 + \\tau ^4 x^4}$ ] .",
    "however , in the last case the parameter @xmath17 could be chosen in a convenient way in order to get better accuracy with the approximation , as we will discuss later , this can be considered as a free parameter .",
    "the other singularity that must be introduced through the auxiliary functions is of the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the efficiency criteria limit the auxiliary functions by forcing them to have exponents of the form @xmath11 .",
    "the above stated line of thought leads us to choose as convenient auxiliary functions    @xmath20    and    @xmath21    once the auxiliary functions are chosen as above , the fractional approximations automatically have only powers multiple of 4 .",
    "all the previous considerations lead to the following form of the two  point quasifractional approximation for the real kelvin function    @xmath22{1 + \\tau ^{4 } x^{4}}}.\\ ] ]    the auxiliary function @xmath23 has to be introduced in order to cancel the @xmath24 behaviour at infinity . with this function",
    "we also define a second free parameter @xmath25 .",
    "here we will consider only the simplest approximation to @xmath3 , thus @xmath26 will be one and the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ ber_aprox_form ] ) will be reduced to    @xmath27{1 + \\tau ^{4 } x^{4}}}.\\ ] ]    the ideas developed on the latest papers on quasifractional approximations are in the sense of not to determine all the coefficients through the powers series and the asymptotic expansions but to leave one or two free parameters@xmath28 and @xmath29that can be determined by minimising the maximum absolute error .",
    "it is clear that other methods to measure the discrepancy between the approximant and the exact function can also be used , such as the lebesgue s integral of the quadratic difference , or other more elaborated methods using lebesgue s integrals of the @xmath30-powers of the difference .",
    "however , for us , the most convenient way to measure that discrepancy has been the maximum absolute error .",
    "the main reason for using free parameters is to avoid the characteristic defects of classic pad @xcite , also common in quasifractional approximations .",
    "defects are when an extraneous pole appears near a zero in the numerator .",
    "that is , there is a zero in the numerator in @xmath31 and another zero in the denominator in @xmath32 and the difference @xmath33 is very small .",
    "due to that problem , the approximation is in good agreement with the function in the whole zone of interest , except when close to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where it goes to @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in order to determine the five unknowns @xmath39 three terms of the power series ( [ ber - series ] ) and two terms of the asymptotic expansion ( [ ber - asymp ] ) will be used .",
    "so a linear system of five equations with five unknowns is obtained .",
    "the solutions will be given in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "looking at the exponential term in ( [ ber - asymp ] ) , the variable @xmath40 appears as more convenient .",
    "thus the power series ( [ ber - series ] ) will be written now as    @xmath41    since we are using only three terms of this series we do not need to go further away than @xmath42 .    now , to compare the power series of @xmath3 and @xmath43",
    ", we will first multiply both functions by @xmath44 in order to rationalise the right hand side .",
    "furthermore the auxiliary functions appearing in ( [ ber_aprox ] ) and defined in ( [ aux_function_cos ] ) and ( [ aux_function_sin ] ) , should be replaced by their respective power series .",
    "thus we obtain    @xmath45    where the first term in the first parenthesis on the right hand side is the power expansion of @xmath46{1 + \\tau ^4 x^4 } $ ] , and constant factors have been absorbed in the definition of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath47 .",
    "equalising now the powers @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath42 in both sides of the equation we obtain    @xmath50    the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath51 is    @xmath52.\\ ] ]    and comparing now the leading terms of @xmath3 , we obtain    @xmath53    equations ( [ x0 ] ) , ( [ x4 ] ) , ( [ x8 ] ) , ( [ inf1 ] ) and ( [ inf2 ] ) determine the values of @xmath54 and @xmath47 as functions of @xmath25 and @xmath17 .",
    "when these equations are solved , an expression for each parameter is obtained in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath17 . and",
    "an approximation @xmath55 is defined for each value of @xmath25 and @xmath17 .",
    "given the initial values @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 , we numerically determine the value of the function @xmath58 and we select the maximum value of this function , which will be the maximum absolute error .",
    "therefore , the maximum absolute error , @xmath59 , will be a function of @xmath25 and @xmath17 .",
    "looking now at @xmath60 as a function , we can determine the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 which minimise this function as a two variable function .",
    "that procedure has been followed and the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 are found as    @xmath63    in order to avoid the defect in the approximation we have to consider only positive values of @xmath47 , thus there is no problem with positive values for the variable @xmath64 which is the region of interest .",
    "this must be taken into account when sweeping through @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the minimising procedure .",
    "local minima which yield negative values for @xmath47 must be discarded .    using these values of @xmath25 and @xmath17 in ( [ x0 ] ) , ( [ x4 ] ) , ( [ x8 ] ) , ( [ inf1 ] ) and ( [ inf2 ] ) , the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath47 are determined and the results are    @xmath65",
    "as it has been stated before , the discrepancy of the approximation will be determined by @xmath66 .",
    "a plot of the real kelvin function , together with the approximation and ten times the absolute error is displayed in figure  1 .    besides , a table of the first five roots of the kelvin function and the approximation is introduced .",
    "notice that the highest relative error in the roots is the first one .",
    "quasifractional approximations to any function have normally their worst accuracy for values of order one .",
    "the behaviour of the approximation becomes more accurate as @xmath64 increases .",
    "another two measures of the good agreement of the approximation with the real kelvin function is the relative difference of the position in @xmath64 of the maxima of the function and the relative error of the amplitude of each maximum .",
    "the following table shows the position in @xmath64 of the first five maxima of @xmath0 and @xmath67 as @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , and the relative difference between them .",
    "the value of each of the first five maxima is also shown , appearing as @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the real kelvin function and the approximation respectively .",
    "the relative error of those figures also appears .",
    "notice that all the relative errors , no matter what is being measured ( i.e. , the roots , the position of the maxima , the amplitude ) decrease as @xmath64 becomes greater .",
    "the same line of thought carried out for the real kelvin function will be followed in this section , since the form of the asymptotic expansions and the power series for both @xmath0 and @xmath72 are very similar .",
    "the imaginary kelvin function is defined as @xcite    @xmath73    where @xmath6 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "the power series of @xmath2 is given by    @xmath74    the asymptotic expansion of @xmath75 has been also given in several references . again , our interest here lays mainly on the leading term , which can be written as    @xmath76    it is a characteristic of hypergeometric confluent functions to have an essential singularity at infinity .",
    "the asymptotic expansion picks that singularity up and shows it through a branch point at infinity with the exponential functions , in the same way that happened for @xmath0 .",
    "the power series of @xmath2 goes as @xmath77 . in order to have an efficient approximation , the auxiliary functions chosen for moving the artificially introduced branch point out of the positive axis and for introducing the singularities that appear in the asymptotic expansion should have a power series of the same form as @xmath2 .",
    "following the same stream of thought used in determining the form of @xmath0 , a correct form for the quasifractional approximation of @xmath2 is    @xmath78{1 + \\bar { \\tau } ^{4 } x^{4}}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are free parameters , introduced for the same reason explained for @xmath0 .",
    "we are going to use only the simplest form of the approximation , thus @xmath81 will be substituted in the previous equation .",
    "thus the two  point quasifractional approximation of @xmath2 will give    @xmath82{1 + \\bar{\\tau } ^{4 } x^{4}}}.\\ ] ]    from now on , exactly the same procedure has been followed in determining the set of five equations used for finding the values of the parameters @xmath83 in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and for minimising the discrepancy of the approximation .",
    "when dealing with quasifractional approximations it is common to take as an initial ansatz @xmath28 and @xmath29 equal to 1 .",
    "this choice proved to be a valid starting point for @xmath84 , even though smaller differences are obtained when using the minimised @xmath85 and @xmath86 given in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath87 function is somewhat more pathological since the choice @xmath88 yields a negative value of @xmath89 , making the initial ansatz useless .    for minimising the maximum absolute error of the two  point quasifractional approximation of @xmath2 a downhill simplex method",
    "has been used @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for the parameters are    @xmath90    the plots of @xmath91 and ten times the absolute error ( @xmath92 ) are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the relative error of the first root is smaller than the one of the first root of @xmath0 because the value of the variable @xmath64 is greater ( i.e. , the first root of @xmath2 it is not as close to zero as the one of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the accuracy for all the roots of @xmath0 and @xmath2 is very high in any case .",
    "once again , the relative error related to the position of the first five maxima of the function and the error of their amplitude will be calculated in the same way performed for @xmath0 .",
    "the notation is exactly the same followed in the calculation of error for @xmath0 before in sec . 4 , but adapted for the function @xmath2 .",
    "the expression of the current distribution within a cylindrical conductor due to a travelling wave has been given in many references .",
    "the current distribution depends on the kelvin real and imaginary functions and is given by @xcite    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the current density on the surface of the conductor and @xmath95 is the radius on the surface .",
    "the skin depth is given by @xmath96 , and it depends on the frequency of the propagating wave .    by means of substitution of @xmath67 and @xmath97 in ( [ current ] ) it is possible to get an analytical approximation to the current distribution within a cylindrical conductor .",
    "the analytical approximation obtained has been used for studying the current distribution within a copper wire with @xmath98 mm .",
    "four different values of the frequency have been taken .",
    "the same figures and plots could be found in marion , for comparison purposes .",
    "the plots obtained using our approximation and those obtained using numerical computation are coincident and no difference can be found at this scale .",
    "therefore , we are only showing the errors in figure  3 .",
    "in this paper analytic approximations have been found for the function @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "these have been used to calculate the current distribution within a cylindrical conductor produced by the propagation of one wave of frequency @xmath99 .    in spite of the strong fluctuation characteristic of the functions @xmath0 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the simple approximations found here not only reproduce the function with high accuracy for all positive values of the variable but the infinite roots or zeroes of the function are also obtained and the relative error of each root decreases with the magnitude of the root .",
    "the largest relative error of the roots for @xmath0 is about 2% and for @xmath2 is 0.5% .",
    "the measure of the discrepancy is difficult for these functions because the function fluctuates and , furthermore , the maximum of the amplitude increases and goes to infinity with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , if we consider the absolute error this will go to infinity with @xmath64 .",
    "on the other hand , if we study the relative error , these errors will go to infinity at the roots of the function .",
    "the best way to measure the good agreement of our approximation is just through the errors of the zeroes and of the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "it is significant that these errors decrease with @xmath64 despite of the large value of the function .",
    "the maximum error of the amplitude for @xmath0 is 3% , and 4% for @xmath2 in the value of the function and of 0.28% and 0.80% in the site of the maximum for @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "these errors clearly show that our approximation can be used for most of the applications we know until now , for example thermo  electrical corrosion in cylindrical conductors .",
    "in general , these approximations might be used whenever kelvin functions appear and a numerical solution is not appropriate . as an example , we have applied our method to the simplest case of the current distribution in a cable , obtaining quite accurate results .",
