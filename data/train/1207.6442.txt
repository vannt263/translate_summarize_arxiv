    "for quantum information applications based on atoms , large atom - photon interactions can be used to interface photonic and atomic qubits . enhancing the interaction can be achieved using either high finesse optical cavities @xcite or strongly focused laser fields @xcite .",
    "high finesse cavities enhance the atom - photon interaction by repeated reflection of a single photon so that the field from a single photon is enhanced by the cavity finesse .",
    "although this approach has been successful with neutral atoms , cavity experiments are complicated to implement for the ion trap system due to technical problems associated with proximity of the cavity mirrors to the ion @xcite .",
    "cavity based systems are also difficult to scale up to a large system of atom - photon interfaces @xcite . in contrast , the strong focusing approach is easy to implement @xcite and a number of approaches have been considered towards scalability .    for the purposes of scaling to a large number of atoms it also desirable to provide the means to trap and individually address single atoms .",
    "a large number of individually addressable single atoms have been trapped by spatial light modulators combined with custom made microscope objectives @xcite but the method is neither simple nor low cost .",
    "micro lens arrays have also been used to create arrays of approximately 80 individually addressable optical dipole traps @xcite but ensuring single atom occupancy was not possible .",
    "an alternative approach is to use spherical mirrors .",
    "spherical mirrors are easy to integrate with both ion traps @xcite and neutral atom experiments . in the case of neutral atoms ,",
    "an optical dipole trap can be formed by focusing collimated light with the spherical mirror @xcite .",
    "if the radius of curvature of the mirror is small , the focus is tight enough to engage the collisional blockade phenomenon @xcite which ensures only one atom can be trapped under weak loading conditions .",
    "alternatively , light assisted collisions in a tightly confining dipole trap can be used to prepare single atoms @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the interaction light can be focused by the same mirror to a tight spot for free space atom - photon coupling .",
    "although spherical mirrors suffer from aberrations , these can be corrected with proper optical elements outside the vacuum chamber @xcite and become less significant with decreasing mirror dimensions . for sufficiently small radius of curvatures , there can be a significant coupling of the light reflected by the mirror into a single mode fibre @xcite .",
    "current methods of producing spherical mirrors involved either silicon based fabrication @xcite or conventional glass polishing techniques .",
    "although arrays of spherical mirrors can be produced by silicon fabrication method , the radius of curvature is limited to hundreds of microns making it difficult to integrate with any practical atom trapping experiments .",
    "conventional glass polishing produced mirrors of large dimensions and can not be used to tightly focus trapping light .",
    "recently we developed a fabrication technique that bridges the gap between the existing technologies , producing mirrors with large enough dimensions for easy integration with experiments but small enough to enable tight focusing of the dipole trap @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the use of our spherical mirrors for trapping single atoms at the focus of the mirror . we obtain a tightly focusing dipole trap with a waist of @xmath0 by illuminating the mirror with a collimated @xmath1 laser .",
    "we use light assisted collisions @xcite to prepare single atoms in this trap with @xmath2 efficiency .",
    "fluorescence collected using the mirror is coupled into a multi - mode optical fibre giving an atom detection efficiency of @xmath3 in a @xmath4 integration time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a model of the fabrication process , which illustrates how the mirror dimensions can be reliably controlled and predicted .",
    "we then characterize the focussing capability of the mirror .",
    "details of our experimental set up are then given in which we characterize the optical dipole trap in terms of single atom loading and detection efficiency .",
    "the fabrication process .",
    "( a ) glass slide of thickness @xmath5 placed on cylindrical hole of radius r@xmath6 and depth h. ( b ) after deformation , the dimple has a depth d and a radius of curvature r. in case of the mirror for the optical dipole trap , typical dimensions are @xmath7 and @xmath8 2 mm.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "details of the mirror fabrication process has been reported elsewhere @xcite . briefly , the method uses borosilicate d263 glass and a ceramic substrate ( macor ) @xcite .",
    "cylindrical holes are drilled into the ceramic and a borosilicate cover slip is placed over them . the substrate and the glass",
    "is then heated in a furnace at low pressure .",
    "when heated to @xmath9 , the glass softens and strongly adheres to the substrate sealing the holes at low pressure .",
    "air at higher pressure is then introduced and the pressure difference causes the softened glass to curve inwards creating smooth spherical dimples .",
    "the process results in ultra smooth surfaces with sub - nanometer roughness .    to estimate the mirror parameters obtained using this process",
    ", we adopt the model developed in @xcite for the fabrication of glass micro - spheres . throughout the deformation process , we assume that the glass surface maintains a near spherical shape .",
    "thus , the radius of curvature , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the cylindrical hole and @xmath13 is the depth of dimple as illustrated in fig.[melting](b ) .",
    "to determine @xmath13 , we assume that the entire process takes place at a constant temperature .",
    "thus , the pressure , @xmath14 , and volume , @xmath15 , of the trapped gas can be related to the initial values by the ideal gas law @xmath16 from geometric considerations the volumes @xmath15 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of the dimple .",
    "thus , the pressure of the trapped gas is given by @xmath20 giving a pressure difference , @xmath21 , of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the external pressure introduced after the holes were sealed .",
    "setting @xmath24 then provides an equation for the equilibrium depth @xmath13 as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath23 .",
    "the solution can then be used in eq .",
    "[ roc ] to determine the radius of curvature .",
    "the time variation of @xmath13 can also be modelled using the methods given in @xcite .",
    "the softened glass at @xmath9 behaves like an incompressible newtonian fluid and it can be shown that time variation of @xmath13 satisfies @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the viscosity of borosilicate glass at @xmath9 and @xmath5 is the thickness of the glass .",
    "taking @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives an estimated time scale of several minutes .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath32 and @xmath31 , we fabricate glass dimples for various hole depths and deformation times and we plot the depth @xmath13 in fig.[depthvshole ] .",
    "error bars on the theoretical plot reflect the uncertainty in pressure due to limitations of the furnace .",
    "although the general trend of @xmath13 as a function @xmath33 is correct , there are two notable deviations from the model predictions : the measured depth does not converge to the predicted equilibrium value , and the time scale to reach equilibrium differs by more than an order of magnitude .    in the actual process , the sealing temperature is not known for sure .",
    "if it occurs below @xmath9 , the enclosed gas in the cylindrical hole is heated up as the furnace reaches the final temperature and the pressure enclosed will be higher than we assumed .",
    "for example , if the hole is sealed at @xmath34 instead of the @xmath9 , the pressure inside the hole will be larger than estimated by approximately @xmath35 .",
    "this could account for the reduced equilibrium value of @xmath13 .",
    "it is not clear why there is a such a large discrepancy between the predicted rate of formation with the actual rate .",
    "however we do note that the viscosity has a very strong dependence on temperature . in any case",
    ", the resulting deformation is very reproducible and the general trend allows us to estimate the parameters needed to achieve a particular mirror geometry .",
    "depth of dimple @xmath13 measured for various depths @xmath33 of the cylindrical hole .",
    "the predicted depth is given by the dotted lines .",

    "( b ) image of the spot showing the main peak and secondary rings .",
    "( c ) cross section of the beam intensity showing a main gaussian peak profile and smaller secondary ring.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    there are just two independent parameters that determine the geometry of a spherical mirror , namely the clear aperture and the radius of curvature .",
    "the clear aperture is given by the hole radius , @xmath25 , and the radius of curvature , @xmath10 , can be controlled by the pressure difference established during fabrication . for our experiments we aimed for a clear aperture of @xmath36 as this enables easy alignment of input beams with waists up to around @xmath37 without significant clipping .",
    "allowing for a @xmath37 working distance for the optic constrains the curvature to be about @xmath38 . with this as a target , we fabricated a mirror which gave a measured curvature of @xmath39 or , equivalently , a focal length of @xmath40 .",
    "the mirror surface was then coated with evaporated silver giving a reflectivity greater than @xmath41 at both @xmath42 and @xmath1 .",
    "the focusing performance of the optic was tested using the setup shown in fig.[spotprofile](a ) .",
    "a collimated beam of waist @xmath37 was incident on the mirror and the resulting focus was imaged using a calibrated 20x long working distance microscope objective .",
    "a 50:50 beam splitter was used as shown so that the focus could be imaged directly .",
    "fig.[spotprofile](b ) shows the actual focus imaged by the microscope objective .",
    "a strong central peak can be seen along with the presence of a secondary ring .",
    "fitting the cross section of the image shown in fig.[spotprofile](c ) to a gaussian profile gave a waist of 2 @xmath430.1 microns .",
    "subtracting a two dimensional gaussian profile from the profile in fig.[spotprofile](b ) , we then estimate , from the residuals , that 12% of the total power lies in the outer ring .",
    "note that , although an ideal optic with a focal length of 1.6 mm would yield a sub micron spot size , spherical aberrations limits the achievable spot size and gives rise to the secondary ring .",
    "however , a spot size of 2 micron still enables us to use light assisted collisions to prepare a single atom @xcite .",

    "light from the fibre is collimated with an aspheric lens giving a beam waist of @xmath37 with a maximum available power of about @xmath44 . the light is then combined along the path of the collection optics using a dichroic mirror as shown in fig .",

    "as determined in the previous section , we estimate a trap depth of @xmath46 @xcite .    the trap is loaded directly from a magneto - optical trap located at the focus of the spherical mirror .",
    "we use a six beam mot configuration consisting of two retroflected , near vertical beams and a third retroflected horizontal beam .",
    "the near vertical beams have a waist of @xmath47 with an angle of 5@xmath48 from the vertical to facilitate making a mot close to the surface of the optic .",
    "the horizontal beam has a waist of @xmath49 which gives maximum overlap with the intersection region of the two near vertical beams .",

    "we detect the presence of an atom using fluorescence measurements .",
    "since light from the cooling beams generates a large background contribution , we use an independent detection beam to excite the atoms .",
    "we use a linearly polarized light sheet which has a @xmath53 cross - section . as illustrated in fig  [ optics ] , the light sheet is retro reflected to reduce the effects of radiation pressure during imaging .",
    "the power in the light sheet is such that it is at five times the saturation intensity of ( @xmath54 ) transition for isotropic polarization @xcite and operated at a blue detuning of @xmath55 .",

    "light from the atoms is reflected into a nearly collimated beam by the spherical mirror .",
    "the light is focused using a 18 mm focal length ashperic lens into a multimode fibre connected to a single photon counting module .",
    "based on the induced stark shifts and the detuning of the detection light we estimate that the atom scatters approximately 700 photons during the @xmath4 detection time out of which approximately 2% are detected by the photon counting module .",

    "the loss rate due to background collisions can be ignored and at equilibrium we have @xmath61 if @xmath62 , the equilibrium number will be approximately zero or one atom .",
    "in such an experiment , one can monitor the trap continuously for the loading of a single atom and proceed with the subsequent experiment once a single atom is detected .",
    "however in our experiment , continuous monitoring of the dipole trap for a single atom is not possible as light from the mot beams saturates our detector .",
