    "the nuclei @xmath0c and @xmath1o are typical light nuclei , and they have been extensively studied based on the cluster approaches  @xcite . since there is no bound nucleus with mass number 5 or 8 , formation of @xmath0c from three @xmath6he nuclei ( @xmath2 clusters ) is a key process of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "here , the second @xmath7 state at @xmath8 mev plays a crucial role , which is the second excited state of @xmath0c and located just above the threshold energy to decay into three @xmath6he nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the existence of three @xmath2 state just at this energy is essential factor in the synthesis of various elements in starts . for also @xmath1o ,",
    "cluster structure has been shown to be extremely important .",
    "although the ground state corresponds to the doubly closed @xmath9 shell of the shell model , this configuration can be also interpreted from four @xmath2 and @xmath0c+@xmath2 view points , if we take certain limit for the inter cluster distances .",
    "also the first excited state of @xmath1o at @xmath10 mev , very close to the threshold to decay into @xmath0c and @xmath6he , can be interpreted as @xmath0c+@xmath6he cluster state  @xcite , and low - lying cluster states just around the threshold are quite important in the synthesis of @xmath1o in starts  @xcite .",
    "various cluster models have been proposed and successfully applied to these nuclei .",
    "however consistent description of @xmath0c and @xmath1o has been a long standing problem of microscopic @xmath2 cluster models .",
    "here the definition of the microscopic model is that the wave function is fully antisymmetrized and the effective interaction is applied not between @xmath2 clusters but between nucleons .",
    "when the effective interaction is designed to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath1o ( four @xmath2 ) , the binding energy of @xmath0c ( three @xmath2 ) becomes underbound by about 10 mev , and on the contrary , when the binding energy of @xmath0c is reproduced , @xmath1o becomes overbound by about 20 mev .",
    "we have previously utilized tohsaki interaction  @xcite , which has finite - range three - body terms , and the obtained result is better than ones only within the two - body terms ; however the problem has not been fully solved  @xcite .",
    "one of the clue to solve this problem is the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction . in most of the cluster models ,",
    "@xmath2 clusters are defined as simple @xmath11 configuration at some point .",
    "these @xmath2 clusters are spin singlet systems and the spin - orbit interaction does not contribute inside @xmath2 clusters and also between @xmath2 clusters . in @xmath3-coupling shell model ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is quite important and this plays an essential role in explaining the observed magic numbers .",
    "according to the @xmath3-coupling shell model , @xmath0c corresponds to the subclosure configuration of spin - orbit attractive orbits ( @xmath12 ) and the spin - orbit interaction works attractively , whereas @xmath1o corresponds to the closure of major shell ( @xmath9 shell ) , where both spin - orbit attractive ( @xmath12 ) and repulsive ( @xmath13 ) orbits are filled and the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction cancels .",
    "therefore , inclusion of the @xmath2 breaking wave function and taking into account the spin - orbit contribution are expected to decrease the binding energy difference of @xmath0c and @xmath1o . to describe the @xmath3-coupling shell model states with the spin - orbit contribution starting with the cluster model wave function , we proposed the antisymmetrized quasi - cluster model ( aqcm )  @xcite . in the aqcm",
    ", the transition from the cluster- to shell - model - structure can be described by only two parameters : @xmath14 representing the distance between @xmath2 clusters and @xmath15 , which characterizes the transition of @xmath2 cluster(s ) to quasi - cluster(s ) and quantifies the role of the spin - orbit interaction .    in nuclear structure calculations ,",
    "it is quite well known that the central part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the calculation should have proper density dependence in order to to satisfy the saturation property of nuclear systems .",
    "if we just introduce simple two - body interaction , for instance volkov interaction  @xcite , which has been widely used in the cluster studies , we have to properly choose majorana exchange parameter for each nucleus , and consistent description of two different nuclei with the same hamiltonian becomes a tough work .",
    "thus it is rather difficult to reproduce the threshold energies to decay into different subsystems .    concerning the density dependence of the interaction , adding zero range three - body interaction term helps better agreements with experiments as in modified volkov ( mv ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the binding energies become quite sensitive to the choice of the size parameter of gaussian - type single particle wave function .",
    "especially , the binding energy and radius of @xmath6he can not be reproduced consistently .",
    "this situation is essentially common in the case of gogny interaction widely used in mean field studies  @xcite .",
    "the nucleus @xmath6he is a building block of @xmath2 cluster states and it is desired that the size and binding energy are reproduced",
    ". the tohsaki interaction , which has finite range three - body terms , has much advantages compared with the zero range three - body interactions .",
    "this interaction is a phenomenological one and designed to reproduce the @xmath2-@xmath2 scattering phase shift .",
    "also it gives reasonable size and binding energy of the @xmath2 cluster , which is rather difficult in the case of zero - range three - body interaction , and the binding energy is less sensitive to the choice of size parameter of gaussian - type single particle wave function because of the finite range effect of the three - body interaction .",
    "furthermore , the saturation properties of nuclear matter is reproduced rather satisfactory .    of course , introducing the term proportional to the fractional power of the density is another possibility to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear systems as in density functional theories ( dft ) , instead of introducing three - body interaction terms .",
    "however , here we perform parity and angular momentum projections , and we also superpose many slater determinants based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) . in this case , it is desired that the hamiltonian is expressed in a operator form such as three - body interaction , which enables us to calculate the transition matrix elements between different slater determinants . from this view point ,",
    "simplified version of finite range three - body interaction is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to combine the use of finite range three - body interaction for the interaction part and aqcm for the wave function part to establish consistent understanding of @xmath0c and @xmath1o .",
    "the original tohsaki interaction gives small overbound for @xmath1o ( about 3 mev )  @xcite , and here , we try to improve by slightly modifying three - body majorana exchange parameter . for @xmath0c , subclosure configuration of @xmath3-coupling shell model , where the spin - orbit interaction plays an important role ,",
    "is coupled to three @xmath2 model spaced based on aqcm . for @xmath1o , the closed shell configuration of the @xmath9 shell is the dominant configuration of the ground state , and we apply four @xmath2 model , which coveres the model space of closed @xmath9 shell .",
    "also , the application of tohsaki interaction has been limited to @xmath4 nuclei , and we add bartlet and heisenberg exchange terms in the two - body interaction for the purpose of applying it to neutron - rich systems .",
    "the hamiltonian ( @xmath16 ) consists of kinetic energy ( @xmath17 ) and potential energy ( @xmath18 ) terms , @xmath19 and the kinetic energy term is described as one - body operator , @xmath20 and the center of mass kinetic energy ( @xmath21 ) , which is constant , is subtracted .",
    "the potential energy has central ( @xmath22 ) , spin - orbit ( @xmath23 ) , and the coulomb parts .",
    "for the central part of the potential energy ( @xmath22 ) , we adopt tohsaki interaction .",
    "the tohsaki interaction consists of two - body ( @xmath24 ) and three - body ( @xmath25 ) terms :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 consist of three terms , @xmath29   ( w^{(2)}_\\alpha + m^{(2)}_\\alpha p^r)_{ij } , \\label{2body}\\ ] ] @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times & &   ( w_\\alpha^{(3 ) } + m_\\alpha^{(3 ) } p^r)_{ij } ( w_\\alpha^{(3 ) } + m_\\alpha^{(3 ) } p^r)_{ik}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 represents the exchange of spatial part of the wave functions of interacting two nucleons , and this is equal to @xmath32 due to the pauli principle ( @xmath33 ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spin and isospin exchange operators , respectively . the range parameters @xmath36 are set to be common for the two - body and three - body parts , and the values are listed in table  [ tohsaki-2 ] together with strengths of two - body interaction @xmath37 , three - body interaction @xmath38 , and the majorana exchange parameters of the two - body interaction .",

    "we extend the application to neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the original tohsaki interaction does have wigner and majorana exchange terms , but spin and isospin exchange terms are missing . because of this , the interaction gives a weak bound state for a two neutron system , as in the case of volkov interaction .",

    "<S> consistent description of @xmath0c and @xmath1o has been a long standing problem of microscopic @xmath2 cluster models , where the wave function is fully antisymmetrized and the effective interaction is applied not between @xmath2 clusters but between nucleons . when the effective interaction is designed to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath1o ( four @xmath2 ) , the binding energy of @xmath0c ( three @xmath2 ) becomes underbound by about 10 mev . in the present study , by taking into account the coupling with the @xmath3-coupling shell model components and utilizing tohsaki interaction , which is phenomenological but has finite - range three - body interaction terms , we show that consistent understanding of these nuclei can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the original tohsaki interaction gives small overbound of about 3 mev for @xmath1o , and this is improved by slightly modifying three - body majorana exchange parameter . </S>",
    "<S> also , the coupling with the @xmath3-coupling shell model wave function strongly contributes to the increase of the binding energy of @xmath0c . </S>",
    "<S> so far the application of tohsaki interaction has been limited to @xmath4 nuclei , and here , we add bartlet and heisenberg exchange terms in the two - body interaction for the purpose of applying it to neutron - rich systems , and it is applied to @xmath5he . </S>"
