    "see text.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    a direct comparison of the two low - temperature absorption spectra of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 and zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom_cco_zco](c ) , where the spectra are plotted vs.wave number scaled to the respective onset wave number @xmath90 of the exciton lines . in case of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 @xmath90",
    "was defined as the purely excitonic line m@xmath81 and in case of zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 the first peak of the fine structure at 13835  @xmath31 was used .",
    "the absorption values are scaled in a way that the curves coincide at the maximum of the absorption peak visible at @xmath91 = 1.05 for cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 . in this",
    "scaling , even the low - energy flanks of the two curves coincide and the peak maximum in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 corresponds to a clear shoulder in zncr@xmath0o@xmath2",
    ". moreover , the emp feature in zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 seems to correspond to a shoulder in the spectrum of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 [ see shaded areas in fig .  [",
    "fig : zoom_cco_zco](c ) ] .",
    "this shoulder is directly followed by the first spin - allowed crystal - field excitation in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 .",
    "we propose that the occurrence of similar features in both compounds and their persistence to the highest studied temperatures ( exceeding the respective curie - weiss transitions ) again favors a structural origin of these excitations .",
    "therefore , the reported suppression of the emp peak above 400  t might be interpreted as a magnetic - field induced structural change.@xcite this scaling further suggests that the @xmath45 and @xmath46 regions are behaving differently in terms of relative intensities for the two compounds , i.e. the @xmath45 and @xmath46 regions appear to be of comparable intensity in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 , while the @xmath46 region seems to have much higher intensity in zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 .",
    "this might be related to the different structural distortions in the two systems in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "there is still a debate with respect to the exact symmetry of the two systems,@xcite but a clear difference is that in zncr2o4 the lattice contracts and in cdcr2o4 it elongates along the @xmath92-axis .",
    "this will certainly influence the transition probabilities and the intensities of the cf transitions .",
    "in summary , we observed exciton - magnon transitions in the triangular - lattice antiferromagnets cucro@xmath0 and @xmath1-cacr@xmath0o@xmath2 and in the spinel cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 . some of the magnon sidebands in these three systems can be directly compared to the spin - wave dispersions reported by neutron scattering studies and reflect the respective complex magnetic structures :    \\(i ) in cucro@xmath0 three sets of fine structures have been observed to emerge with lowering temperature .",
    "the first four of the related sideband energies of + 13 , + 40 , + 56 , + 81 , and + 95@xmath33are in agreement with magnon energies observed by antiferromagnetic resonance and neutron scattering experiments , while for the last one no direct correspondence could be obtained . however , this magnon sideband at + 95@xmath33from the purely excitonic feature r3 at 19730@xmath33exhibits an anomaly in the temperature dependence of its line width and intensity at about 11  k. this temperature is in agreement with a reported estimate of a binding - unbinding transition of @xmath5 vortices .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of the line width of the purely excitonic line r3 can be understood by assuming that the magnon lifetime is determined by the density of topologically protected @xmath5 vortices .",
    "\\(ii ) in @xmath1-cacr@xmath0o@xmath2 , several magnon sidebands at @xmath77 , @xmath93 , + 51 , + 78 , and + 120@xmath33have been observed .",
    "the interplane coupling of 3.5  mev corresponds well to the sideband at @xmath78@xmath33 .",
    "the other modes can not be unambiguously assigned on the basis of the currently available neutron scattering data , but several low - lying magnon modes have been reported in a similar energy range.@xcite",
    "\\(iii ) in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath2 magnon sidebands at @xmath9417 and + 61.7@xmath33have been observed at lowest temperatures .",
    "the first magnon energy corresponds to a single magnon observed by neutron scattering and the second sideband can be understood as a three - magnon sideband , where all three spin - wave excitations observed by neutron scattering at 5.2 , 18.6 , and 37.9@xmath33are participating .",
    "moreover , the three - magnon sideband remains visible up to the curie - weiss temperature of about 70 k pointing to the formation of short - range helical spin correlations throughout the classical spin - liquid regime .",
    "however , in the spinel zncr@xmath0o@xmath2 only a weak fine structure has been observed in agreement with a previous report .",
    "the temperature dependence of an absorption ( emp ) reportedly associated with the magnetic structure and suppressed in very high - magnetic fields suggests a primarily structural origin of this excitation in contrast to previous interpretations .",
