    "a _ relativistic positioning system _ is defined by four clocks @xmath0 ( _ emitters _ ) in arbitrary motion broadcasting their proper times @xmath1 in some region of a ( four - dimensional ) space - time @xcite .",
    "then , every event reached by the signals is naturally labeled by the four times @xmath2 the _ emission coordinates _ of this event . the first to propose such physical construction of emission coordinates seem to have been b. coll @xcite .",
    "up - to - date references on this concept and its applications and a brief report on relativistic positioning can be found in @xcite .",
    "although some explicit results have been obtained for generic four - dimensional relativistic positioning @xcite , a full development of the theory requires a previous training on simple and particular situations . a two - dimensional approach to relativistic positioning systems allows the use of precise and explicit diagrams which improve the qualitative comprehension of general four - dimensional positioning systems .",
    "the basic features of this two - dimensional approach and the explicit relation between emission coordinates and any given null coordinate system has been presented in @xcite .",
    "there , we have also studied in detail the positioning system defined in flat space - time by geodesic emitters .    in a subsequent work @xcite",
    "we have studied the possibility of making relativistic gravimetry or , more generally , the possibility of obtaining the dynamics of the emitters and/or of the user , as well as the detection of the absence or presence of a gravitational field and its measure .",
    "this possibility is examined by means of a ( non geodesic ) _ stationary positioning system _ constructed in two different scenarios : minkowski and schwarzschild planes .    in this work",
    "we go further in the analysis of two - dimensional positioning problems . until now @xcite we have considered stationary or geodesic positioning systems in which the user had , a priory , a partial or full information about the gravitational field and a partial or full information about the positioning system .",
    "here we consider a new situation : the user knows the space - time where he is immersed ( flat , schwarzschild , ... ) but he has no information about the positioning system . can the data received by the user determine the characteristics of the positioning system ? can the user obtain information on his local units of time and distance and on his acceleration ?",
    "the answer to these questions is still an open problem for a generic space - time , but in this work we undertake this query for minkowski plane and we analyze the minimum set of data that determine all the user and system information .",
    "a remarkable result is that the data received by a user of the positioning system are not independent quantities because of they are submitted to what we call _ the public data constraints_. a consequence of these constraints is the _ delay master equation _ which implies that the accelerations of the emitters and of the user along their trajectories are determined by the sole knowledge of the emitter positioning data and of the acceleration of only one of the emitters and only during a ( causal ) _ echo interval _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the interval between the emission time of a signal by an emitter and its reception time after being reflected by the other emitter .",
    "in order to better understand our results we illustrate them with two specific situations , the positioning systems defined , respectively , by two inertial emitters or by two ( stationary ) uniformly accelerated emitters . in them , starting from a partial set of user data , we obtain the proper time and acceleration of the user and we determine the full dynamical properties of the positioning system .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section - ii ] we summarize the basic concepts and notation about relativistic positioning systems in a two - dimensional space - time . in sec .",
    "[ section - iii ] we obtain some constraint conditions which restrict the user data and show that all the user and system information can be obtained from the emitter positioning data and the acceleration of only one of the emitters .",
    "[ section - iv ] and sec .",
    "[ section - v ] are devoted to illustrate these general results by considering the above mentioned particular situations . in sec .",
    "[ section - vi ] we deduce stronger restrictions on the user data , the delay master equation , and we clarify the role that this equation plays by applying it to the positioning systems considered before .",

    "[ discussion ] with a short discussion about the present results and comments on prospective work .",
    "a short communication of some results of this work was presented in the spanish relativity meeting ere-2007 @xcite .",
    "in a two - dimensional space - time , a _ relativistic positioning system _ is defined by two clocks , with world lines @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( _ emitters _ ) , broadcasting their proper times @xmath5 and @xmath6 by mean of electromagnetic signals . in the region @xmath7 between both emitters ,",
    "the past light cone of every event cuts the emitter world lines at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath10 are the _ emission coordinates _ of the event : the two proper time signals received by any observer at the event from the two clocks ( see fig . [",
    "fig : grid - data](a ) ) . nevertheless , the signals @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not constitute coordinates for the events in the outside region @xcite .    the plane @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in which the different data of the positioning system can be transcribed is the _ grid _ of the positioning system . in this grid ,",
    "the trajectories of the two emitters define an interior region and two exterior ones .",
    "this interior region in the grid is in one - to - one correspondence with the interior region in the space - time , i.e. with the set @xmath7 of events that can be distinguished by the pair of times @xmath13 that reach them .",
    "but the exterior regions in the grid have no physical meaning ( see @xcite for more details on the grid ) .",
    "an observer @xmath14 traveling throughout an emission coordinate domain @xmath7 and equipped with a receiver reading the received proper times @xmath13 at each point of his trajectory , is called a _ user _ of the positioning system .",
    "we consider in this work _ auto - locating positioning systems _ , which are systems in which every emitter clock not only broadcasts its proper time but also the proper time that it receives from the other .",
    "thus , the physical components of an auto - locating positioning system are @xcite :    a _ spatial segment _ constituted by two emitters @xmath3 , @xmath4 broadcasting their proper times @xmath15 @xmath6 _ and _ the proper times @xmath16 , @xmath17 that they receive each one from the other , and    a _ user segment _ constituted by the set of all users traveling in an internal domain @xmath7 and receiving these four broadcast times @xmath18 .",
    "any user receiving continuously the _ user positioning data _ @xmath19 can extract the equation @xmath20 of his trajectory in the grid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grid - data](a ) ) : @xmath21    on the other hand , any user receiving continuously the _ emitter positioning data _ @xmath22 may extract from them not only the equation ( [ user - trajectory ] ) of his trajectory , but also the equations of the trajectories of the emitters in the grid ( see fig . [",
    "fig : grid - data](b ) ) : @xmath23    eventually , the emitters @xmath3 , @xmath4 could carry accelerometers and broadcast their acceleration @xmath24 , @xmath25 , meanwhile the users @xmath26 could be endowed with receivers able to read the broadcast emitter accelerations @xmath27 .",
    "these new elements allow any user to know the acceleration scalar of the emitters : @xmath28 users can also generate their own data , carrying a clock to measure their proper time @xmath29 and/or an accelerometer to measure their proper acceleration @xmath30 .",
    "the user s clock allows any user to know his proper time function @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) and , consequently by using ( [ user - trajectory ] ) , to obtain the proper time parametrization of his trajectory : @xmath33 the user s accelerometer allows any user to know his proper acceleration scalar : @xmath34 thus , a relativistic positioning system may generate the _ user data _ : @xmath35    the emitter trajectories ( [ emitter - trajectories ] ) and the emitter accelerations ( [ emitter - accelerations ] ) do not depend on the user that receives them .",
    "thus , among the user data ( [ user - data ] ) we can distinguish the subsets :    * _ emitter positioning data _ @xmath18 , * _ public data _",
    "@xmath36 , * _ user proper data _ @xmath37 .    the purpose of the ( relativistic ) theory of positioning systems is to develop the techniques necessary to determine the space - time metric as well as the dynamics of emitters and users from ( a subset of ) the user data .    in order to study specific positioning systems in known space - times ,",
    "it is useful to obtain the explicit expression of the emission coordinates in terms of arbitrary null coordinates @xmath38 .",
    "are those whose gradients , @xmath39 , determine light - like directions . ]",
    "the general method to obtain this transformation has been exposed in @xcite and , in next section , we apply it to the inertial null coordinates in flat space - time .",
    "we can define the _ inertial null coordinates _",
    "@xmath38 : @xmath40 . in this coordinates @xmath38 , the metric tensor takes the form : @xmath41 . ]",
    "in the development of the two - dimensional approach we have analyzed situations @xcite under the assumption that the user has a priory information about the positioning system , that is , the user knows , at least partially , the dynamics of the emitters .",
    "now , we work under the weaker assumption that the user knows the space - time where he is immersed but he has no a priory information about the positioning system . then , we want to analyze if the public data received by the user afford information about : ( i ) his local unities of time ( ii ) his acceleration , ( iii ) the metric in emission coordinates , ( iv ) the coordinate transformation from emission coordinates to a characteristic coordinate system of the given space - time , and ( v ) his trajectory and emitter trajectories in this characteristic coordinate system .",
    "although some results obtained elsewhere @xcite for the schwarzschild plane suggest that many of the results that we present here could be generalized to non - flat space - times , from now on we focus on the _ flat case_.      let us consider the positioning system defined by the emitters @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the minkowski plane , and let us assume for the moment that the _ proper time history of the emitters _ is known in an inertial null coordinate system @xmath38 : @xmath42    the transformation from emission coordinates @xmath10 to the inertial null system @xmath38 is given by @xcite : @xmath43 note that relations ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) define _ emission coordinates _ in the _ emission coordinate domain _ @xmath7 between both emitters . but",
    "outside this region the transformation ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) also determines null coordinates , but they are not emission coordinates for our positioning system , i.e. they can not be constructed by means of signals broadcasted by its two clocks @xcite .    in emission coordinates , the emitter trajectories take the expression : @xmath44 where , from ( [ emitters - inertial ] ) and ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) , the functions @xmath45 are given by : @xmath46 conversely , from this last formulas , we obtain : @xmath47 as obtained in ( [ emitter - trajectories ] ) , the emitter positioning data determine the emitter trajectories @xmath48 in the grid .",
    "then , taking into account ( [ emitters - inertial ] ) and the expression of the transformation ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) , relations ( [ phis - tris ] ) give the precise expression of the following simple fact : + _ statement 1_. if one knows the transformation from emission to inertial coordinates , the emitter positioning data @xmath49 determine the proper time history of the emitters in inertial coordinates .      from the metric line element in",

    "besides the emitter positioning data @xmath49 , the user needs dynamical information of the system .",

    "then , the acceleration scalar functions , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , can be known from the public data , and the _ emitter shift parameters _ @xmath57 can be calculated by means of ( see ( [ a - shift ] ) ) : @xmath58 now we particularize the dynamic equation ( [ a - dynamic - eq - flat ] ) for the the emitter @xmath3 ( resp . ,",

    "but , given the emitter acceleration scalars , the constant factors which we take in the two integrals ( [ shift - alpha ] ) could correspond to two different inertial systems .",
    "nevertheless , we will see below that the constraints on the public data allow to determine one emitter shift in terms of the other emitter shift , both with respect the same inertial system .",
    "the emitter dynamic equations ( [ dynamic - emitters - shift ] ) contain essential information on the positioning system that we will now analyze . from these four equalities",
    "we can eliminate @xmath68 and @xmath69 and obtain the _ constraint equations for the emitter shifts _ : @xmath70 % s_1(\\tau^1 ) \\ , \\dot{\\varphi}_1(\\tau^1 ) =   s_2(\\varphi_1(\\tau^1 ) ) \\label{12-shift-3 }   \\ , .",

    "these constraints can be considered as differential equations on the emitter trajectories @xmath48 if the acceleration scalars @xmath55 are known , an approach that we will consider elsewhere . in the present work we are interested in studying auto - locating positioning systems for which the emitter positioning data @xmath73 and , consequently , the functions @xmath48 are known . from this point of view the public data constraint equations ( [ constraint - acceleration-1 ] ) and ( [ constraint - acceleration-2 ] ) state : + _ statement 3_. if a user receives continuously the emitter positioning data @xmath22 and only the acceleration of one of the emitters , then the user knows the acceleration of the other emitter .",
    "the constraint equations for the emitter shifts ( [ constraint - shift-1 ] ) and ( [ constraint - shift-2 ] ) determine the shift of an emitter with respect to an inertial system in terms of the shift of the other emitter whit respect to the _ same _ inertial system and the emitter positioning data @xmath73 .",
