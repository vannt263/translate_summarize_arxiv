    "the california and carnegie planet search has been observing @xmath1 stars , some since 1997 , at keck observatory in an ongoing program to detect radial velocity variations caused by planetary companions .",
    "one source of error in the measured velocities is `` jitter '' due , in part , to flows and inhomogeneities on the stellar surface that can produce variations in the measured radial velocity of a star , and can even mimic the signature of planetary companions ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "describe how the california and carnegie planet search distinguishes planetary signals from jitter .",
    "the best - fit orbital parameters of a keplerian velocity model depend on the relative errors of points in an observed radial velocity time series .",
    "thus , one requires a quantitative model of all sources of noise , including jitter , in order to properly calculate the orbits of a potential planetary companion .",
    "@xcite studied jitter in f , g , and k dwarfs , modeling the effects of spots and convection on radial velocity measurements as a function of @xmath2  and activity .",
    "they concluded that radial velocity jitter should increase with @xmath2 , activity , and @xmath3 , and found this to be the case empirically in a small sample of active stars .",
    "@xcite found that among four hyades stars with significant radial velocity variation , three showed correlated photometric variation , consistent with the effects of rotationally modulated spots and plage .",
    "@xcite used a sample from the lick planet search results to produce a formula for predicting jitter in stars given @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and photometric variability .",
    "the purpose of this work is not to explore the astrophysical sources of jitter or to refine the formula of @xcite which predicts jitter from photometric variability and @xmath5 ( a quantity that is difficult to measure in stars as old as typical planet search stars ) , but to provide an empirical estimate of jitter using stellar parameters available without an independent photometric program or detailed spectroscopic analysis : @xmath7 , , and @xmath8 .",
    "the strategy is to divide the planet search sample into groups of stars with similar values for these parameters .",
    "the model then simply predicts that a given star will exhibit levels of jitter similar to those stars with similar properties , i.e. , in the same group .",
    "to measure the radial velocity jitter this work employs a sample of stars that have useful radial - velocity time series and no detected companions . from the @xmath1 stars in the keck planet search program , this sample comprises 531 stars with at least nine radial velocity measurements , with activity levels reported in @xcite , and _ hipparcos _ colors and parallaxes @xcite .    rather than attempt to subtract the velocity signatures of known companions from the sample",
    ", some of which may be rather poorly determined , the sample here excludes those stars harboring published or announced companions from the sample altogether .",
    "furthermore , this sample excludes stars that show clear , unambiguous evidence for unannounced companions ( stellar and planetary ) .",
    "these cases involve very long period companions of unknown mass where the radial velocities show curvature , or keplerian amplitudes of more than 1 km@xmath9 .",
    "finally , the sample excludes several `` borderline '' stars whose radial - velocity time series have best - fit keplerians with false alarm probabilities @xcite of less than 0.1 .",
    "the final sample comprises 448 stars .",
    "following @xcite , this work employs the evolution metric    @xmath10    as a quantitative proxy for evolution . here , @xmath7- and -values are from the _ hipparcos _ catalog , and    @xmath11    represents the _ hipparcos _ average main sequence where @xmath121.11255 , 5.79062 , -16.76829 , 76.47777,-140.08488 , 127.38044 , -49.71805 , -8.24265 , 14.07945 , -3.43155@xmath13 .",
    "[ msfig ] shows @xmath14  plotted on a color - magnitude diagram with the stars from the sample described in [ sample ]",
    ". evolved stars , lying above the main sequence , have positive values of @xmath15 , while subdwarfs have negative values .",
    "while a more appropriate metric might employ measured abundances to lift the degeneracy between the effects of metallicity and evolution on @xmath15 , the goal here is to provide a description of radial velocity jitter without the benefit such measurements .",
    "active stars , especially active f dwarfs , exhibit higher levels of jitter than their inactive counterparts . to quantify this relationship , this work employs the activity metric @xmath8 , as measured in @xcite for the planet search stars , which represents the amount of emission in the h and k  line core normalized by nearby continuum regions .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , transformed @xmath8 to @xmath16 which represents the fraction of a star s total luminosity emitted by the chromosphere in the h and klines .",
    "example spectra containing h and k  lines can be found in most of the planet discovery papers by the california and carnegie planet search , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 , however , is not well calibrated for stars with @xmath17 or @xmath18 . to overcome this , this work employs an alternative metric of stellar activity , @xmath19 , defined by @xcite ( who used the expression `` @xmath20 '' in that work ) and described again in @xcite .",
    "this metric differs from @xmath16  primarily in that it does not correct for a photospheric component to the h and k  lines and in that it is a flux density , rather than a fraction , since it is constructed using an additional factor of @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite argued that @xmath19  is a more appropriate metric for comparing activity levels among stars since it is related to soft x - ray and h and k fluxes by power laws with no color or luminosity dependence .",
    "@xcite determined the units of @xmath19  to be @xmath22 .",

    "apparently , these stars very low metallicities ( @xmath29 } } < -1 $ ] ) require either a different calibration of @xmath19  or a different expression for @xmath26  ( or both ) .",

    "the standard deviation of the velocities , @xmath35  is defined about a linear trend , @xmath36 , for all of the time series :    @xmath37    the quantity @xmath35  includes random measurement uncertainties such as those arising from photon statistics , estimated as follows .",
    "each observation of a star consists of a spectrum divided into  400 chunks , each of which is analyzed independently the planet search doppler analysis pipeline to determine the value of @xmath38 , the differential radial velocity of the star with respect to a template observation .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath38 values of these 400 chunks provides an estimate of the measurement error for a given observation . because the planet search employs an exposure meter at keck , most observations of a given star have the same signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , so the measurement errors for all observations of a given star are usually very similar .",
    "thus , a single number @xmath39  provides an estimate of the contribution of measurement error to @xmath35  for observations of a given star .",
    "following @xcite , this work employs the metric @xmath40 to quantify radial velocity variations in excess of @xmath39 .",
    "the exposure meter at keck ensures that those velocity errors limited by s / n are roughly constant across the sample , contributing 2 - 4 m@xmath9to the error budget . the exceptions to this rule are faint m dwarfs , which receive a maximum of @xmath41 minutes per exposure and therefore have photon - limited errors of 3 - 8 m@xmath9 , and active f dwarfs that have high astrophysical jitter and receive short exposure times to keep errors photon - limited . for these stars ,",
    "the observed rms velocities are nearly equal to @xmath39 , indicating that photon statistics dominate the error budget . in cases in which where radial velocity variations in excess of @xmath39  remain undetected , this work simply assigns an upper limit of @xmath42 :    @xmath43      in addition to astrophysical jitter , @xmath44  also measures undetected planetary companions and systematic errors as discussed below .    many stars in this sample undoubtedly harbor still - undetected , low - amplitude planets . only after many planetary orbits with good phase coverage",
    "can one use the periodic nature of the signals and keplerian fits to distinguish these signals from jitter @xcite . refining these fits to determine the precise orbital elements of a planetary companion",
    "requires still more observations , and the statistics of the residuals to these fits is complex .",
    "it is for the sake of simplicity and uniformity in the sample that this work employs only linear fits to the velocity time series and not keplerians .",
    "systematic errors have many sources , including imperfect deconvolution of template spectra ( especially for m dwarfs ) and poor charge transfer in the hires tek ccd .",
    "the planet search estimates these errors to be on the order of 3 m@xmath9for m dwarfs and @xmath45 m@xmath9for other stars ( g. w. marcy 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "some component of these systematic errors will be accounted for which the subtraction of @xmath39  from @xmath35 , but systematic errors , by their nature , are not well characterized by gaussian noise , so some component of these errors probably remain in @xmath44 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify the known dependencies of radial velocity jitter on stellar parameters , namely that active , blue , and evolved stars exhibit more jitter than old , main sequence , g dwarfs .",
    "this section , therefore , discusses trends of jitter with respect to @xmath27 , @xmath15 , and .",
    "[ actjit ] shows @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath19  for stars with @xmath46 .",
    "there is a clear increase in @xmath44  with @xmath19 , such that the most active stars consistently show more than 4 m@xmath9of jitter .",
    "a few stars with @xmath47 appear to show more than @xmath48 m@xmath9of jitter ; these stars may harbor planets whose",
    "orbital periods have not yet become apparent from the radial velocity time series .",
    "however , two of these stars may be very young ( @xmath49 gyr ) according to @xcite , so one can not discount the possibility that these @xmath44values are due purely to astrophysical jitter .",
    "this work employs the following method to fit a polynomial to these data , which contain a few high outliers and points for which only an upper limit can be set .",
    "first , i divide the distribution into four evenly spaced bins in @xmath50 . within each bin",
    "i then find the median value , 20th percentile , and 80th percentile of @xmath51 ( represented by large gray filled circles in fig .",
    "[ actjit ] ) , yielding three sets of points to which i fit second - order polynomials . in figure 3 ,",
    "dashed lines represent the fits to the 20th and 80th percentile points , and the solid line represents the avereage of these fits , representing the model of the median .",
    "the appendix describes the definition of a median and a percentile in a data set containing upper limits .",
    "note that the choice of a second - order polynomial here is not physically or statistically motivated , but is merely chosen to be a simple , accurate description of the distribution with a smooth transition to the low - activity subsample .",
    "there is very little change in the median jitter for stars with @xmath52 , so these fits are only applicable for stars with @xmath53 . of the 72 such stars in the sample ,",
    "53% lie below the solid line in fig .",
    "[ actjit ] , 80% lie below the 80th percentile fit , and 20% lie below the 20th percentile fit . table  [ jitters ] contains coefficients for these polynomials .",
    "the result here , that jitter increases with activity is consistent with the result of @xcite , who found @xmath54 , with @xmath55 for g and k dwarfs and @xmath56 for f dwarfs .",
    "although here the fit is parabolic and is applied to a different metric , one can compare the results by fitting a line to @xmath44  versus @xmath57  for the f stars and the g and k stars separately , using the asurv statistical analysis package rev 1.2 @xcite , which implements the methods presented in @xcite to handle the upper limits .",
    "the best - fit values for found @xmath58 by applying the buckley - james method and the parametric em algorithm are @xmath59 for f dwarfs ( @xmath60,@xmath46 ) and @xmath61 for g and k dwarfs ( @xmath62 , @xmath46 ) . while these results differ somewhat from the results of saar et al .",
    ", the strong color dependence remains .",
    "however , using the activity metric @xmath27  instead , however , with its extra factor of @xmath21 , this color dependence is somwhat reduced : a similar fit to the relation @xmath63 returns @xmath64 for g and k dwarfs and @xmath65 for f dwarfs .",
    "the choice of @xmath27  thus reduces the color dependence of the jitter - activity relation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ saarplot ] .",
    "[ evojit ] shows @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath15  for stars with @xmath52 .",
    "stars with @xmath66 have higher typical @xmath44-values than stars on the main sequence .",
    "the trend here is weak , so in this case , the model consists of three broad groups , each modeled independently : main - sequence stars ( @xmath46 ) , slightly evolved stars ( @xmath67 ) , and subgiants ( @xmath68 ) .    fig .  [ evohist ]",

    "[ evohist ] , and numerically in table  [ jitters ] .",
    "again , the appendix describes the statistics of medians for these data sets .",
    "[ evohist ] shows that subgiants exhibit higher @xmath44  values than their main - sequence counterparts , having a median @xmath44  value @xmath69m@xmath9 , significantly higher than the non - astrophysical sources of noise discussed in   [ errors ] .",
    "in fact , no subgiant in the sample performs better than 3 m@xmath9 .",
    "these stars are therefore poor velocity standards , due to jitter .",
    "the distribution of slightly evolved stars is very similar to that of main sequence stars .",
    "this work nonetheless treats them separately here , because their activity levels , normally a good indicator of jitter , are generally lower and therefore not comparable to main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "their numbers are too few for further subdivisions into bins of color or activity , so the model given here simply incorporates median @xmath44  values for this group as a whole .",
    "[ normhist ] shows the distribution of @xmath44  values for stars in three  ranges ( corresponding roughly to spectral types f , g and k , and m ) that have @xmath46 and @xmath70 . here",
    "again , vertical bars show the values of the 20th percentile , median , and 80th percentile , and shaded regions represent upper limits .",
    "jitter in these unevolved inactive stars is not a well - determined , smooth function of color , but , broadly speaking , three distinct  groups exist .",
    "blue stars ( @xmath71 ) generally show @xmath72 m@xmath9of jitter , while g and k dwarfs exhibit a median @xmath44  value of 3 m@xmath9 . the large number of shaded stars in the distribution of f stars in fig .  [ normhist ]",
    "reflects the fact that , as noted in   [ sample ] , planet search stars do not receive more exposure time than their jitter levels warrant , to keep errors photon - limited . note that this practice does not artificially inflate the estimate of jitter in these stars because the method of calculating medians accounts for these upper limits ( appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath44  distribution of m dwarfs exhibits a tail of high jitter values ( @xmath73 7 m@xmath9 ) , which most likely represents systematic errors in the deconvolution of their spectra , made difficult by the lack of continuum in such cool stars .",
    "the large shaded regions of the m dwarf distribution are due to these stars faintness : as noted in   [ sample ] , no planet search star receives more than 10 minutes of exposure at a time , so faint m dwarfs will yield lower s / n ratios and thus have photon - limited precision .",
    "g and k dwarfs yield the best radial - velocity performance , with over 30 members exhibiting rms velocities below 2 m@xmath9 .",
    "it is fortunate that the best performing stars in the sample are those that most closely resemble the sun .",

    "only two sample stars meet the criteria for study here (   [ sample ] ) and have @xmath53 and @xmath83 .",
    "they have @xmath44  values of 20 and 11 m@xmath9 , both higher than the values predicted by the median curve in fig .  [ actjit ] , which are @xmath72 m@xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that red , active stars may have substantially more jitter than their bluer or more - inactive counterparts .",
    "the region of @xmath27-@xmath15  space corresponding to active ( @xmath53 ) , evolved ( @xmath84 ) stars is poorly populated , not just in this sample , but also in other surveys of sun like stars @xcite .",
    "the sole such star in this sample has @xmath85 m@xmath9 , substantially higher than the 6 m@xmath9predicted by the @xmath44-activity relation here .",
    "such stars often represent massive early f stars that have entered or are entering the subgiant phase before losing substantial amounts of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "table  [ jitters ] contains the @xmath44  values that are typical for various regions given in ( ) -@xmath19-@xmath15  space .",
    "the jitter model assumes that a given star will exhibit levels of jitter similar to those of other stars in its region .",
    "when the planet search pipeline fits keplerian orbits to radial velocity time series , it incorporates the jitter - model estimate of the jitter into its estimate of the errors .",
    "furthermore , the model also consists of interpreting the median values in the appropriate region of table  [ jitters ] as the estimated jitter , but with the following minor modifications .    to prevent large discontinuities in the jitter model ,",
    "the model linearly interpolates the median jitter for stars within 0.1 mag of the  boundaries .",
    "for instance , an unevolved , inactive star with @xmath86 would have predicted jitter of 3.725 m@xmath9 : since it is within 0.1 mag of the boundary between the fourth and fifth entries in table  [ jitters ] , the model interpolates between the median value for the @xmath71 and @xmath81 regions . the model also similarly interpolates between the first and second regions of table  [ jitters ] for stars with @xmath87 .",
    "the model also sets the predicted jitter of active stars ( @xmath30 ) to the greater of the predicted jitter and that predicted for an inactive star with the same  and @xmath7 .",
    "both this jitter model and the regions and values in table  [ jitters ] have evolved and become more sophisticated over time , so the model described here may not agree precisely with jitter estimates published in previous work by the california and carnegie planet search .",
    "this model is generally applicable for most planet search stars . since it was derived using keck data , in particular data before the september 2004 upgrade of the hires ccd , it accounts for systematic errors that may not be present in radial velocity data from other telescopes . for jitter values",
    "@xmath88m@xmath9 , however , it predominantly measures astrophysical jitter , and so is generally applicable .",
    "the presence of undetected planets around the sample stars means that these values may be slightly overestimated , but the use of medians mitigates this effect .",
    "jitter is more important to the detection of exoplanets than the characterization of their orbits .",
    "the effects of including jitter in one s noise estimate on best - fit orbital parameters for a single - planet system are generally very small ( @xmath89 ) , in part because the errors are typically already nearly equal .",
    "jitter plays a more important role in determining whether radial velocity variations are of stellar or keplerian origin . to the extent that the jitter measured here is astrophysical and not due to systematics or still - undetected planets , the @xmath90 m @xmath9of jitter exhibited by most inactive stars represents a minimum detection threshold below which planets will be very difficult to detect .",
    "this work concerns a sample of the california and carnegie planet search data stars representing stars without obvious or detected planets observed at the keck observatory . this sample describes the typical radial velocity stability , measured as @xmath44 , of most stars in the planet search .",
    "the metric @xmath44  includes the effects of undetected planets , systematic errors ( @xmath91m@xmath9 ) , and astrophysical jitter .    among inactive stars",
    "f , g and k , and m dwarfs show sightly different amounts of radial velocity jitter , from 3.5 m@xmath9for g and k dwarfs to nearly 5 m@xmath9for m dwarfs . evolved stars ( @xmath92 ) show significant amounts of jitter , while those only slightly evolved appear more consistent with main sequence stars .",
    "active stars show markedly more jitter ( @xmath93 m @xmath9 ) than inactive stars , and this jitter increases with activity .",
    "the activity metric @xmath19  of rutten can provide an estimate of jitter without the strong color dependence of previous models that employed @xmath16as a metric .",
    "the median is defined as the @xmath94th largest element of a sorted @xmath95-element data set .",
    "the presence of measurements for which one can only set limits ( nondetections , for instance ) complicates matters somewhat , but a median can still be similarly defined .",
    "consider a sorted @xmath95-element data set @xmath96 , comprising elements @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "each @xmath97 represents a measurement that is either exact ( a _ data point _ ) , an _ upper limit _ , or a _ lower limit_. the set @xmath96",
    "should be sorted such that for otherwise equal elements , an upper limit is less than a data point , which in turn is less than a lower limit .",
    "( note that these definitions apply only to the sorting procedure ; different comparison conditions apply below . )",
    "one seeks to test the value of each element @xmath97 as a candidate median by comparing @xmath99 , the number of elements unambiguously above the value of @xmath97 , to @xmath100 , the number unambiguously below it .",
    "for the purposes of computing @xmath100 , element @xmath101 is counted as being below the value of @xmath97 if , in the sorted array : ( 1 ) @xmath101 is a data point and @xmath102 or ( 2 ) @xmath101 is an upper limit and @xmath103 .",
    "note that when @xmath97 represents an upper limit , @xmath97 is less than the value of @xmath97 by definition , and so contributes to @xmath100 , and that when @xmath101 represents a lower limit , it does not contribute to @xmath100 at all .",
    "similarly , @xmath101 contributes to @xmath99 if @xmath104 when @xmath101 is a data point , or if @xmath105 when @xmath101 is a lower limit .",
    "the median is then is the value of the @xmath106th element of @xmath96 such that @xmath99 is most nearly equal to @xmath100 .",
    "if more than one such element exists , these can simply be averaged . in some cases , such as a data set consisting entirely of upper limits , no median can be defined .",
    "similarly , the @xmath107th percentile can be defined as the value of @xmath97 such that @xmath108 is most nearly @xmath109 . naturally , the 50th percentile is equivalent to the median .",
    "for example , consider the appropriately sorted data set @xmath110 , in which the first and fourth elements represent upper limits .",
    "the values of @xmath111 for this set are @xmath112 , and similarly @xmath113 .",
