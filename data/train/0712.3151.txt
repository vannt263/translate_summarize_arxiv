    "in particular , we will investigate the dependence of the gamma - ray fluxes and the annihilation cross - section on the gluino mass and the mass difference of the two lightest neutralinos .",
    "detailed studies in the literature have investigated the complementarity of accelerator measurements at lhc / ilc and astrophysical observations , e.g.  @xcite , to unveil the nature of dark matter . here , we focus on the complementary constraints in the fp region with the forthcoming atmospheric cherenkov telescope h.e.s.s .",
    "ii and lhc searches using realistic performances for both experiments .",
    "this fp region is also of great interest for searches via neutrino telescopes  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : some key points of the supersymmetric focus point framework and related phenomenological features are given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes various issues related to @xmath0-ray signals expected in cherenkov telescopes and the detection sensitivity of the upcoming phase ii of the h.e.s.s .",
    "the constraints from the @xmath0-ray flux senstivity to the parameter space in the focus point region are studied in section 4 .",
    "mssm spectrum measurements at the lhc for this parameter space region are discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the potential complementarity between h.e.s.s .",
    "ii and atlas measurements . conclusions and perspectives",
    "are given in section 7 .",
    "we consider the framework where supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector is mediated to the visible world through gravitational interactions between the very heavy hidden fields and the mssm sector .",
    "although little is known about the actual dynamics responsible for this breaking and its mediation mechanisms , it is reasonable to assume that the gross features of the low energy spectrum can be encapsulated in a universality assumption ( and possible deviations from it ) for the effective soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at a scale close to the planck or the gut scale .",
    "the more detailed features of this spectrum are then determined by quantum effects obtained through the running down to the electroweak scale .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the theoretical uncertainties at the high ( susy breaking ) scale are different in nature from those involving the running to the low ( electroweak ) scale .",
    "the former can not be reduced without a better knowledge of the underlying new physics , while the latter are in principle reducible through the improved calculational theoretical tools such as the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) codes and spectrum calculators , where for instance scale dependencies , threshold effects , higher order corrections , etc ... are standardized . in practice , the effects of these two types of uncertainties are not easy to disentangle when one tries to determine in a model - independent bottom - up approach the fundamental parameters of the model , ultimately starting from experimental data .",
    "moreover , in a collider environment such as the lhc one would presumably aim first at typical susy discovery events , then at the determination of mass differences of various susy particles which are kinematically accessible . with this respect , resorting to detailed predictions in a top - down approach should be taken only as a guide for the possible patterns of susy mass spectra , production rates , branching ratios , etc ... , as well as the complementary requirements for a good dark matter candidate ( relic density , predictions for direct and indirect dark matter searches ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on mssm spectrum patterns where all the scalar quarks and leptons are in the multi - tev range and thus out of direct reach at the lhc , while the lighter neutralinos and charginos and of course the lightest higgs remain accessible .",
    "such patterns are motivated by the so - called focus point scenarios  @xcite where it is noted within msugra that for @xmath5 and @xmath6 tev , @xmath7 could be very large and still allow electroweak symmetry breaking and the right @xmath8 boson mass to occur without a large fine - tuning between the order parameter @xmath9 and @xmath10 at the electroweak scale .",
    "this feature is due to the quantum effects which push the running of @xmath11 to an essentially unique value , a focus point , at some given low scale , irrespective of its initial value at very high scales .",
    "it so happens that for the above range of parameters this focus point occurs at a scale @xmath12 of order the electroweak scale , and where @xmath13 is also of the same order , together with @xmath14 due to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in this case",
    ", the smallness of the @xmath15 parameter leading to a non negligible higgsino component for the lightest neutralino has immediate consequences on the dark matter issues  @xcite , reducing the neutralino relic density and increasing the reaction rates and fluxes respectively for direct and indirect dark matter detection .",
    "these distinctive features , together with other ones due to the heaviness of the sfermion sector ( such as the suppression of flavor changing neutral currents and the electric dipole moments of the electron and the neutron ) makes this scenario with low fine - tuning very interesting to study .",
    "however , the low fine - tuning in the ewsb condition seems to be traded for a very large sensitivity to the top yukawa coupling and thus to the physical top mass , as was shown in various studies in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the practical consequence of this sensitivity is the important dispersion in the output of different spectrum calculator and rge codes and thus in the predictions of the various experimental observables , not to mention numerical convergence issues as pointed out in  @xcite through a comparison of the two codes isajet 7.69  @xcite and suspect 2.34  @xcite .",
    "these features hint at the need for further standardisation of the various codes through the inclusion of improved calculations at similar levels ; but we anticipate that this would probably not be enough to improve substantially the situation , due to the intrinsic high sensitivity on input parameters in the focus point regions . for that , one would require a better theoretical understanding of this high sensitivity ( meaning of the dependence of the focus point location on the running scale , etc ) . since in the present study we are mainly interested in the potential of the experimental complementarity between h.e.s.s .",
    "phase ii and atlas for the challenging multi - tev spectrum pattern , we will ignore the above theoretical uncertainties and consider the focus - point - like regions sticking for convenience to a given code , namely isajet  @xcite to generate the mssm mass spectrum and couplings .",
    "we have however performed cross - checks with the suspect code  @xcite and found reasonable agreement for the overall focus point region ( see also section 4 for further discussions ) .",
    "the msugra parameter space is defined by the following set of four parameters and a sign and @xmath16 that would result from a flat khler metric . ] : @xmath17 with @xmath7 the common scalar mass , @xmath18 the common gaugino mass , @xmath19 the trilinear coupling , @xmath20 the sign of the higgsino mass and @xmath21 the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vev ) ratio . in the sequel of the paper",
    ", we will perform detailed scans of the parameter space in the focus point region using both isajet 7.69 interfaced with darksusy 4.1  @xcite , and isajet 7.71 .",
    "the choice of the astrophysical targets to be observed is of main importance for the dark matter signal searches . among the most commonly suggested sources  @xcite",
    ", various studies such as  @xcite have shown that the galactic center could be an interesting object under the assumption that the dm density halo presents a strong density increase towards its inner region .",
    "the dark matter density profile extrapolated to the central region is currently parameterized following the cored spherical models as proposed by  @xcite or as halos with a cusp as proposed by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the cuspiness of the halo is not yet confirmed by the rotation curves of the stars  @xcite and is in contradiction with a high value of the microlensing optical depth in the central region  @xcite which can not be due to the diffuse dm but rather to the presence of faint stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the other argument against the presence of a large density of the dm in the galactic center is its impact on the large galactic bar rotation which could be modified by the dynamical friction with dark matter medium  @xcite .",
    "however , microlensing optical depth and dynamical friction arguments are slightly controversial  @xcite and a cusp at the galactic center is not yet ruled out . it has to be underlined that the galactic center region is rich in potential @xmath0-ray emitters such as supernova remnants , the supermassive black hole sgr a * , the recently discovered hess j1745 - 290 source  @xcite , and the standard interactions of charged cosmic rays producing diffuse @xmath0-ray emission  @xcite .",
    "the most promising astrophysical objects with large mass - to - luminosity ratio are the spherodal dwarf galaxies ( dsph ) of the local group , periodically crossing the galactic plane .",
    "the not too distant ones are draco , sagittarius and canis major located respectively at @xmath22 80 , 24 and 8 kpc from the heliocentric position .",
    "the presently measured star rotation curves provide the mass - to - luminosity ratio in the range of 20 to 100 and no final answer has been given about cuspiness or not of the dark matter density profile , so the cored density profile should also be considered when predictions for @xmath0-ray fluxes from the neutralino annihilations are performed . as the line - of - sight integration of dark matter density",
    "is mainly driven by the distance value of the object , the canis major galaxy is certainly the most promising target . on the other hand",
    ", this galaxy seems to be the most disrupted one by the tidal forces as it orbits our milky way .",
    "the expected flux ratios between dsphs and the galactic center taken as a reference source are respectively @xmath22 0.03 , 0.15 and 0.5 for draco , sagittarius and canis major , as calculated for a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) cusped profile by  @xcite . despite smaller @xmath0-ray fluxes expected for dwarf galaxies , they consist of less complex environments compared to the galactic center region as pointed above and present lower background coming from astrophysical sources .",
    "the extended tev emission along the galactic plane leads to a diffuse astrophysical background which is very challenging to overcome .",
    "dwarf galaxies are currently in the scope of the h.e.s.s .",

    "various studies are available in the literature  @xcite which demonstrate that for an integrated luminosity of @xmath98  fb@xmath99 inclusive searches for events including multiple jets and/or leptons and missing transverse energy would allow the discovery at the lhc of gluino production up to masses of @xmath100  gev , thus covering most of the investigated region .    beyond the mere discovery of a signal , the lhc should be able to perform measurements of the susy spectrum which would allow the experiments to put constraints on the predicted relic density  @xcite .",
    "one point in the region addressed here was studied in detail in  @xcite , and the possible ways of extracting a parameter measurement were investigated .",
    "it turned out that the cleanest signal for parameter measurements would be the study of the three - body decay @xmath101 where the @xmath102 would be produced in the decay @xmath103 . alternatively",
    "the same signal could be searched for through the direct production of neutralinos in association with charginos in proton - proton interactions .",
    "this chain would give a clean final state signature  @xcite with two opposite - sign same - flavour leptons .",
    "the kinematics of the three - body decay imply that the invariant mass of any two particles in the decay must be smaller than the difference between the mass of the mother particle and the mass of the remaining particle .",
    "therefore , from the observation of one ( or more ) kinematic end - points in the invariant mass distribution of the two leptons from the decay given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dec ] ) the mass difference @xmath104 can be measured .",
    "the error on this measurement has a systematic component , arising from lepton selection cuts , and a statistical component which will scale both with the value of the mass difference and with the number of events observed .",
    "this latter component will vary over the susy parameter space due to variations in the mass spectrum and in the total susy production cross - section . for the model studied in  @xcite , a precision of order 1%",
    "is obtained , which reflects the excellent measurement capabilities of the lhc experiments for leptons .",
    "we have investigated the lhc reach for this measurement for the region of msugra space defined in section 4 , by calculating the number of events expected at the lhc for the decay given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dec ] ) for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath99 . the number of events shown are independent of the detector assumptions . for the quoted selection efficiencies we refer to an atlas analysis in parametrised simulation .",
    "the results are valid for the generic performance of an lhc detector and are expected to be equivalent for cms .",
    "we used isajet 7.71  @xcite for the calculation of spectra and branching fractions and prospino  @xcite for the nlo cross - section for gluino production .",
    "the results are shown in the right - hand side panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0mhalf ] in the @xmath67 plane before selection efficiency cuts .",
    "the sharp cut on the right - hand side is due to the fact that we do not consider models for which @xmath105  gev , at which point the kinematic end point in the two - lepton invariant mass distribution starts to be masked by the z peak that arises from the decay in two leptons . when the decay @xmath106 becomes kinematically accessible ( i.e. when the neutralino mass difference exceeds the z mass )",
    ", the previous kinematic signature resulting from a three - body decay is lost , and the two body process that occurs instead does not allow us to make an unambiguous and model independent measurement of the neutralino mass difference .",
    "this two body process will dominate up to the point where a neutralino decay channel featuring a light higgs h , @xmath107 , becomes open .",
    "the higgs decays mostly into @xmath108 pairs , and the extraction of the @xmath109 peak above the large combinatorial of @xmath83 jets from gluino decays is very challenging .",
    "for the three - body decay of the neutralinos to leptons , in the analysis of  @xcite an efficiency of @xmath22 25% is achieved for the signal , the susy background is @xmath22 0.6 times the signal , and a sm background of @xmath22 250 events is expected for 100  fb@xmath99 . the sm background is dominated by @xmath110 production .",
    "this background , as well as the susy backgrounds , can be easily evaluated from the data themselves .",
    "in fact the two leptons from the three - body decays of the neutralino , being from the decay of a virtual z , must have the same flavour and opposite sign .",
    "the two isolated leptons from @xmath110 are produced from the decays of two w and can therefore have any flavour combination .",
    "it is therefore easy to statistically subtract the background by subtracting the invariant mass distribution of @xmath111 pairs from the sum of the distributions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 pairs .",
    "equivalent considerations are valid for the susy backgrounds , where the flavours of the two leptons are uncorrelated . assuming that the efficiency of the analysis cuts and ratio between signal and susy background do not vary dramatically in the investigated region , a signal of @xmath22350 events would be needed for the observation at 5@xmath37 level for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath99 .",
    "the number of signal events is essentially determined by the gluino mass , as is clear in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gluinomass ] , where the number of signal events is given on the ( @xmath114 ) plane .",
    "the opposite sign - same flavour two - lepton signal should therefore be observable for @xmath115  gev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we discuss here the complementarity of the indirect detection with the phase ii of h.e.s.s .",
    "and the atlas searches at lhc in the focus point region .",
    "the potentialities of the two experiments in the fp region can be readily compared through the integrated @xmath0-ray flux and the expected number of signal events for next - to - lsp 3-body leptonic decays , in the @xmath77 plane , displayed respectively in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0mhalf ] . the left - hand side plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0mhalf ] shows the h.e.s.s . @xmath0-ray flux contours for a 5@xmath37 detection .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "@xmath0-ray integrated flux sensitivity which is at the level of @xmath116 , allows us to test susy models characterized by universal scalar soft mass parameters above 3300 gev and gaugino soft mass parameters above 280 gev . from the number of signal events for 100 fb@xmath99 in the 3-body leptonic decay shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0mhalf ] , the atlas sensitivity will allow us to investigate @xmath7 lower than 4200 gev and @xmath18 as high as 550 gev . thus the combination of the sensitivity of each experiment allows us to cover the overall region .",
    "this point highlights the complementarity between the indirect detection of dark matter and the susy searches at lhc .",
    "moreover , an overlap is obtained in a small region characterized by scalar soft masses in the 3300 - 4200 gev range and gaugino soft masses between 280 and 550 gev . in case of a signal discovery consistent with this region , complementary cross - checks between the two experiments",
    "would lead to further constraints on the allowed parameter space in the @xmath77 plane .    for further illustration ,",
    "we have chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluinomass ] a given point in the parameter space : @xmath117 this point , with the top mass set to 175 gev and the mass spectrum computed with isajet , is close to the point ( sometimes dubbed su(2 ) ) which has been chosen by the atlas experiment for a detailed study  @xcite . for each quantity",
    "reported in table  [ tab : su2 ] , two values are given corresponding to the output spectra of isajet7.69 and isajet7.71 .",
    "this allows to give an estimate for the theoretical uncertainties . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : gluinomass ] and table  [ tab : su2 ] , this particular point , which is within the reach of atlas , is also within the reach of h.e.s.s .",
    "ii provided a typical 50 hours observation time of a galactic center type source .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : atlas ] , a key parameter in the atlas sensitivity is the gluino mass .",
    "the sensitivity curves of each experiment allow to constrain different regions in the plane of the gluino mass versus the mass difference of the two lightest neutralinos as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluinomass ] .",
    "as can be seen , one anticipates lower flux values for larger neutralino mass differences .",
    "given an astrophysical model for the source ( see section 4 ) , h.e.s.s .",
    "ii would thus put lower limits on the neutralino mass differences which can be further refined with some knowledge of the gluino mass .",
    "moreover , given the sensitivity zone of h.e.s.s .",
    "ii , one finds that a larger gluino mass would allow the exploration of a larger fraction of the parameter space .",
    "in contrast , and as illustrated in from fig .  [",
    "fig : gluinomass ] , atlas will have larger sensitivities for lighter gluinos . in any case , and irrespective of the gluino mass , the extraction of information from atlas measurements becomes problematic for a neutralino mass difference exceeding 85 gev . finally , comparing the",
    "two considered observables in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : gluinomass ] one notes a reversed sensitivity to the mass parameters : atlas would provide a strong constraint on the gluino mass whereas the indirect detection is more sensitive to the neutralino mass differences .",
    "orthogonal constraints can thus be obtained by indirect detection and collider searches , and their possible combination would reduce significantly the allowed parameter space .",
    "in this paper we have examined the complementarity of two approaches to unravel signatures of dark matter particles in the case where the latter are neutralino lsps in the focus point region of the msugra scenario .",
    "searches at colliders in this region which is difficult to investigate as compared to the so - called bulk region , will benefit from complementary input from indirect searches through @xmath0-rays ensures that squarks and sleptons will be visible at the lhc .",
    "the greater range of visible sparticles will provide a greater knowledge of the sparticle mass spectrum . ] . in the present study we used the most realistic simulations for both atlas and h.e.s.s .",
    "ii for which we considered the galactic center as a benchmark astrophysical dm source .",
    "we found that the two experiments will typically explore two different regions of the studied parameter space with some possible overlap , allowing in principle complementary analyses .",
    "we illustrated these features in terms of the universal soft parameters as well as in terms of the physical masses , the first corresponding to a top - down model - dependent approach while the second illustrates the more challenging model - independent one .",
    "for instance , in the scanned range of neutralino lsp masses from 50 to 300 gev , atlas will be sensitive to gluinos lighter than 1300 gev whereas h.e.s.s .",
    "ii , with a flux sensitivity of the order of @xmath118 , will be able to cover all the region above 1 tev .",
    "furthermore , the mass difference of the two lightest neutralinos which is a key observable for atlas , is interestingly found to be a sensitive parameter for the @xmath0-ray fluxes that h.e.s.s .",
    "ii can observe or constrain .    more generally , in the very near future , h.e.s.s .",
    "ii and lhc will be two major experiments allowing us to probe the supersymmetric hypothesis for dark matter with an , up to now , unequalled capability .",
    "neutralino masses in the yet uncovered 100 gev range will be accessible to h.e.s.s .",
    "ii thus filling the energy gap between the current h.e.s.s .",
    "i and the glast satellite experiment to be launched in spring 2008 .",
    "finally , if susy signals are discovered at the lhc , the cross - sections , branching ratios and masses of the new particles determined with a few fb@xmath99 luminosity , would provide valuable search windows both for direct and indirect supersymmetric dark matter detection . of course , substantial systematic uncertainties arise on the astrophysical parameters in indirect searches , which can be reduced through an improved knowledge of the halo profiles of the observed sources . direct detection also suffers from systematic effects related to astrophysical and nuclear parameter uncertainties which affect the constraints on the nucleon - wimp cross - sections .",
    "the more model - independent measurements of the susy parameters will require data samples collected with hundreds of fb@xmath99 luminosity at the lhc , as well as independent input from indirect ( or direct ) dark matter searches as illustrated in this paper .",
