    "the band theory of itinerant magnetism has been much developed in the past half a century on the basis of the density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite with local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "the dft explains quantitatively the ground - state magnetism of 3@xmath3 transition metals and alloys .",
    "the first - principles band calculations with use of the lsda , for example , yield the magnetization per atom 2.15 @xmath4 for fe and 0.59 @xmath4 for ni , which are in good agreement with the experimental values  @xcite 2.22 @xmath4 and 0.62 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the lsda stabilizes artificially the fcc fe instead of the bcc fe with the volume contraction by 15 % .",
    "the gga has solved the problem on the stability of structure in fe  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , understanding of the finite - temperature magnetism in transition metals is still far from the final goal of quantitative description .",
    "the stoner theory based on the dft band calculations yields the curie temperatures ( @xmath1 ) , 6000 k for fe and 3000 k for ni  @xcite , which are 6 or 5 times as large as the observed values ( 1040 k for fe  @xcite and 630 k for ni  @xcite ) . because of a large discrepancy between the theory and the experiment , many theories which take into account spin fluctuations at finite temperatures",
    "have been developed  @xcite .",
    "hubbard  @xcite and hasegawa  @xcite proposed a single - site spin fluctuation theory ( ssf ) on the basis of the functional integral method  @xcite and the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite .",
    "they explained the curie - weiss susceptibility in 3@xmath3 transition metals and obtained the curie temperatures in fe and ni which qualitatively agree with the experiments .",
    "the ssf , however , reduces to the hartree - fock theory at @xmath5 because it is based on a high - temperature approximation .",
    "therefore , the theory does not take into account electron correlations at the ground state as discussed by gutzwiller  @xcite , hubbard  @xcite , and kanamori  @xcite .",
    "kakehashi and fulde  @xcite proposed a variational theory at finite temperatures which takes into account the gutzwiller - type electron correlations at the ground state and reduces to the ssf at high temperatures .",
    "they found that the curie temperatures in fe and ni are reduced by @xmath6 due to correlated motion of electrons .",
    "hasegawa  @xcite also proposed a similar theory on the basis of the slave - boson functional integral method .",
    "these theories are not suitable for systematic improvements of the theory because of the difficulty in finding a suitable temperature dependence of the effective potential being projected onto the static fields . in order to make a systematic improvements possible , we proposed the dynamical cpa  @xcite which fully takes into account the single - site spin and charge fluctuations self - consistently , and clarified the basic properties of the theory with use of a monte - carlo method . in the next paper  @xcite",
    "which we refer to i , we proposed more analytic method to the dynamical cpa using the harmonic approximation ( ha )  @xcite .    towards quantitative calculations ,",
    "it is indispensable to take into account realistic band structures in solids . in our recent paper  @xcite",
    "which we refer to ii , we proposed the first - principles dynamical cpa combining the dynamical cpa+ha with the lda+u scheme  @xcite based on the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbitals ( tb - lmto )  @xcite .",
    "quite recently we extended the calculations taking into account the dynamical corrections up to the 4th order in coulomb interactions , and have shown that the single - particle excitation spectra obtained by the first - principles dynamical cpa explain systematic change of the x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and the bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bis ) data from sc to cu at high - temperatures  @xcite .    in our numerical calculations , we adopted the coulomb interactions @xmath7 obtained by anisimov _ et .",

    ", considerable efforts to obtain the first - principles @xmath7 and @xmath0 have been made at the ground state .",
    "aryasetiawan and coworkers  @xcite obtained the coulomb and exchange interactions for @xmath3 orbitals which are screened by @xmath8 electrons , using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and the lmto method .",
    "the same type of calculations has been performed by using the first - principles wannier orbitals by miyake and aryasetiawan  @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that irrespective of transition metal elements the exchange energy integral @xmath0 are reduced by about @xmath9 as compared with the atomic ones .",
    "although the methods have been applied to many other compounds  @xcite , there is no systematic investigation for the influence of the screened @xmath0 on magnetic properties .",
    "we investigate in this paper the ferromagnetic properties of fe , co , and ni on the basis of the first - principle dynamical cpa using both the atomic exchange interaction energies ( atomic @xmath0 ) and the exchange interaction energies screened by 30% ( screened @xmath0 ) .",
    "we examine the role of the exchange energy parameters in the magnetic properties at finite temperatures and clarify their validity to the magnetic properties .",
    "we will demonstrate that use of the screened @xmath0 does not necessary improve theoretical results at finite temperatures , though we find some improvements at low temperature regime .",
    "as we have proven in our previous papers  @xcite , the dynamical cpa is equivalent to the many - body cpa  @xcite in disordered alloys , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite in the metal - insulator transitions , and the projection operator cpa  @xcite for excitation problem in solids .",
    "the first - principles dmft calculations for fe and ni have been performed at the ground state by miura and fujiwara  @xcite within the iterative perturbation method .",
    "the finite - temperature dmft calculations for fe and ni have been performed by using the hamiltonian without transverse spin fluctuations  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "atomic exchange interaction energy @xmath10 ry was adopted for fe and ni .",

    "iii , we present numerical results of calculations for the densities of states as the excitation spectra , magnetization vs temperature curves , curie temperatures , paramagnetic susceptibilities , effective bohr magneton numbers , as well as the amplitudes of local magnetic moments in fe , co , and ni . by comparing these quantities calculated by the atomic @xmath0 with those obtained by the screened @xmath0",

    "although we have to improve further the theory of dynamical cpa+ha at low - temperatures in order to obtain more solid conclusion , the present results obtained in the high - temperature region should be reasonable because the theory is an approach from the high - temperature limit and the magnetic short range order is not significant at high temperatures .",
