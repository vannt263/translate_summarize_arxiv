    "motivated by studies using the bethe ansatz , kerov , kirillov and reshetikhin  @xcite introduced interesting new combinatorial objects coined rigged configurations ( rcs ) , and found a bijection to semistandard tableaux .",
    "it was later realized  @xcite that this type of bijection can be extended to a bijection between rcs and elements in a multiple tensor product of kirillov  reshetikhin ( kr ) crystals of type @xmath5 satisfying highest weight conditions .",
    "since there is an action of kashiwara operators on crystals , it is natural to try to find the action on rcs through the bijection .",
    "this was achieved by the third author in  @xcite for @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and subsequently in  @xcite for @xmath9 by considering the action of the promotion operator on rcs .",
    "we wish to consider a similar problem for type @xmath1 . since the multiplicities of irreducible components in a multiple tensor product turn out large , we start by considering the single kr crystal @xmath0 in this paper . for classical kashiwara operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) the action",
    "has already been provided in  @xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 using the involution @xmath14 corresponding to exchanging the dynkin nodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 . since @xmath14 commutes with @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath17 , we only need to define the action of @xmath14 on rcs which are @xmath18-highest weight .",
    "this is performed by defining a map @xmath19 from @xmath20-diagrams , another combinatorial object parameterizing @xmath18-highest weight elements , to @xmath18-highest weight rcs .",
    "this map has an interesting feature .",
    "we cut a given @xmath20-diagram into columns , associate to each column an atomic rc , and add up these atomic rcs in a certain way .",
    "in other words , @xmath19 can be interpreted as a linear map .",
    "such a nice relationship between rigged configurations and @xmath20-diagrams was originally suggested through the analysis of the expression of the combinatorial @xmath21-matrix  @xcite written in terms of @xmath20-diagrams via the expected property that the combinatorial @xmath21-matrix acts as the identity on rigged configurations ( conjecture  [ conjecture.r ] ) .    combining these results we obtain our first main theorem ( theorem  [ theorem.main ] ) describing the affine crystal structure on rigged configurations corresponding to a single kirillov ",

    ", the core of the construction of @xmath12 and @xmath11 is the bijection @xmath22",
    "@xcite between @xmath20-diagrams and @xmath23-highest weight kashiwara ",

    "however , the bijection @xmath22 requires a non - trivial algorithm as described in proposition  [ proposition.gamma ] . according to our results ,",
    "@xmath20-diagrams are related to rigged configurations by a linear operation @xmath19 .",
    "thus it is tempting to regard @xmath20-diagrams and rigged configurations as having a common mathematical origin .",
    "we remark that these results can be viewed as another important example of significant properties of rigged configurations with respect to deep structures of the underlying algebra .",
    "for example , in  @xcite an interesting new bijection related to rigged configurations and littlewood  richardson tableaux is introduced which is expected to be an analogue of the involution corresponding to exchanging dynkin nodes 0 and @xmath24 constructed in  @xcite .",
    "another such phenomenon is that generalizations of schtzenberger s involution become simple operations on rigged configurations ( taking complements of the riggings , see  @xcite ) .",
    "also the complicated action of the combinatorial @xmath21-matrix becomes trivial on rigged configurations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this property plays a key role in the recently discovered connection with a discrete integrable system called the box - ball system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is desirable to find a description of the bijection @xmath25 between rigged configurations and elements of tensor product of kirillov  reshetikhin crystals in an explicit way .",
    "this brings us to the next purpose of the present paper .",
    "we provide an explicit combinatorial algorithm for @xmath25 ( section  [ section.cb ] ) , which leads to a definition of a completely new set of tableaux which we coin kirillov  reshetikhin tableaux ( see section  [ section.filling map ] for the definition ) . for type @xmath5 the bijection from rigged configurations to kirillov  reshetikhin crystals",
    "is given by successively applying a fundamental algorithm @xmath26 .",

    "reshetikhin crystal the combinatorial definition of the bijection agrees with the correspondence under the affine crystal isomorphism . at the end of the paper we state",
