    "compact grain models therefore appear to be viable , whereas all three of the fluffy grain models considered here appear to be firmly ruled out by the @xmath1 diagnostic .",
    ", the bam2 model would be allowed by the @xmath1 diagnostic if @xmath228 , but the @xmath0 diagnostic requires @xmath229 , so the bam2 model would remain incompatible with the observational constraints . ]",
    "we have shown how the global structure of porous dust grain agglomerates leads to increased x - ray scattering at small angles , when compared with the scattering properties of spherical grains ( both single size and the wd01 size distribution ) that are constrained to have the observed ratio of extinction in the @xmath111 and @xmath110 bands .",
    "the enhanced small - angle scattering implies that observations of scattered x - ray halos can be used to constrain the internal geometry of interstellar grains .",
    "applying the @xmath0 and @xmath1 diagnostics described above , we find that the observed x - ray halo around gx13 + 1 is inconsistent with grains consisting of random aggregates with porosities @xmath230 , at least for the monomer sizes considered here ( @xmath87 m ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argued that the dust toward gx13 + 1 could not consist of porous grains , on the grounds that porous grains could not produce sufficient overall scattering .",
    "our @xmath1 diagnostic uses the strength of the `` core '' of the scattered halo to constrain the dust porosity , but now we use the fact that porous grains would produce _ too much _ small - angle scattering per unit @xmath119 .",
    "this exploratory study has focused on the x - ray scattering properties of only the grains that dominate the optical extinction , with the expectation that these are representative .",
    "future studies should :    1 .",
    "use size distributions of grain aggregates ( adjusted to reproduce the full extinction curve and not just @xmath8 ) rather than just averaging over random realizations of a single aggregate size as was done here .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 diagnostics for single - size silicate spheres with @xmath231 provide a good approximation to @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculated for the full wd01 size distribution , so we are confident that using single - size fluffy grains with @xmath232 provides a reasonable approximation to what @xmath0 and @xmath1 would be for size distributions constrained to reproduce the observed extinction curve .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 , in particular , will change when the single `` representative '' grain size is replaced by a size distribution that reproduces the ir - uv extinction curve .",
    "the @xmath1 diagnostic is expected to be more robust , because the grains that dominate the visual extinction are also expected to dominate the scattering at @xmath233 .",
    "2 .   include carbonaceous material , even though that material contributes only @xmath16440% of the total grain volume .",
    "again , we have already tested for sensitivity to the carbonaceous component by showing that @xmath0 and @xmath1 for single - size silicate spheres approximates @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the full wd01 size distribution , including carbonaceous grains , but it would be best to explicitly consider fluffy grain models that include a carbonaceous component .",
    "3 .   examine the effect of varying the monomer size .",
    "the monomer size used in the present work ( 0.040@xmath234 m ) was chosen arbitrarily .",
    "while we expect that similar results will be obtained for monomer sizes @xmath235 , this remains to be verified by future ( numerically challenging ) calculations .    although confirmation by more extensive future studies ( as discussed above ) will be invaluable",
    ", the diagnostics developed here , in particular the @xmath1 diagnostic , already demonstrate that the dust toward gx13 + 1 has porosity @xmath236 .",
    "this finding appears to rule out models ( e.g. , mathis & whiffen 1989 ; voshchinnikov et al .",
    "2006 ) in which the interstellar grain mixture is dominated by highly - porous aggregates with @xmath237 .",
    "the porosity of interstellar dust grains therefore appears to be _ lower _ than the porosity of the submicron grains in the debris disk around au mic , which ( based on interpretation of observed polarized scattering ) have @xmath238 , or micron - sized cometary dust grains , which also appear to have @xmath239 ( shen et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "why interstellar grains are _ not _ highly - porous is an open question .",
    "gyroresonant acceleration by mhd turbulence in diffuse clouds appears able to drive @xmath240 grains to velocities @xmath241 ( yan et al .",
