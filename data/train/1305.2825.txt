    "during the last two decades , observations of near - earth objects ( neos ) have uncovered the existence of a near - earth asteroid belt made of minor bodies with diameters smaller than 50 m and moving in earth - like orbits with low eccentricity ( rabinowitz et al .",
    "putative members of this near - earth belt have perihelia in the range 0.91.1 au , aphelia less than 1.4 au , low eccentricities , a wide range of inclinations and unusual spectral properties ( rabinowitz 1994 ) . this parameter range is sometimes called the arjuna region ( rabinowitz et al . 1993 ; gladman , michel & froeschl 2000 ) after the hero of hindu epic poem mahabharata .",
    "main - belt asteroids are not a plausible source for this near - earth belt ( bottke et al . 1996 ;",
    "rabinowitz 1997 ) .",
    "amor asteroid fragments provide a reasonable origin for most members and planetary ejecta from mars , the earth  moon system and venus may have produced the lowest inclination objects ( bottke et al .",
    "although the vast majority of neos have significant eccentricity and/or inclination , a dynamically cold population that includes objects with both low eccentricity and low inclination exists .",
    "periodic close encounters with the earth  moon system make this type of orbits quite unstable ; therefore , its members are necessarily transient but , due to their earth - like orbital elements , they may also easily become temporary co - orbitals , in particular horseshoe librators to the earth .    the dynamical evolution of asteroids moving in earth - like orbits has already been studied ( tancredi 1997 ; brasser & wiegert 2008 ; kwiatkowski et al . 2009 ; granvik , vaubaillon & jedicke 2012 ) but objects in resonance with the earth have been explicitly excluded .",
    "however , the existence , characterization and study of such group could be of great importance not only for planning low - cost interplanetary missions ( e.g. , davis , friedlander & jones 1993 ) or asteroid mining ( e.g. , lee 2012 ) but also to reduce the effects of future earth impact events as those objects are easy to access but , on a dark note , they also have an increased probability of becoming impactors due to their low relative velocities to the earth ( e.g. , lewis 1996 ) . using data from the jpl horizons system to explore this neglected population",
    ", we found that the recently discovered aten asteroid 2013  bs@xmath0 exhibits all the orbital attributes expected of an object in such group . not only its relative ( to the earth ) semimajor axis is 0.0024 au but also the values of its eccentricity ( 0.08 ) and inclination ( 0@xmath58 ) are close to those of the earth .",
    "in fact , its orbit is currently the most earth - like among those of asteroids moving in earth - like orbits .",
    "the study of the dynamical evolution of 2013  bs@xmath0 led us to find a previously undiscussed dynamically cold group of small near - earth asteroids that experience repeated resonant episodes with the earth .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly outline our numerical model .",
    "section 3 focuses on 2013  bs@xmath0 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the new dynamically cold resonant family .",
    "the relevance of our findings is discussed and our conclusions summarized in section 5 .",
    "0.15truecm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ members ]         but for 2012 fc@xmath4 , a kozai resonator . ]",
    "it should be noticed that the orbits of these objects are highly chaotic , with e - folding times of 10100 yr , but they remain as neos for nearly 1 myr .",
    "only a fraction of that time , typically @xmath6 10000 yr , the objects stay in the region defined above but in some cases they remain there for nearly 0.3 myr .",
    "although the current dynamical status of these objects is reliable , predictions beyond a few hundred years can only be made in statistical terms due to frequent close encounters , well below the hill radius ( 0.0098 au ) , with the earth ",
    "moon system ( see fig . [ all ] , panel a ) .",
    "objects in this group may experience repeated co - orbital and kozai episodes and transitions are triggered by the encounters .",
    "the most usual state is symmetric horseshoe but quasi - satellite and trojan episodes have also been observed during the simulations . due to their low relative velocities to the earth most of the objects studied here undergo a large number of brief episodes ( 130 d ) in which their keplerian geocentric energy becomes negative even if they are several hill radii from the earth . in table",
    "[ members ] , the value @xmath7 is the dimensionless encounter velocity with respect to the earth at infinity ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the relative velocity between the object and the earth , and @xmath10 is the circular velocity of the earth at 1 au ) , given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the tisserand parameter related to the earth .",
    "all the objects have very low values of @xmath7 .",
    "2006  rh@xmath13 was an actual natural satellite of the earth for over a year in 2006 ( kwiatkowski et al .",
    "2009 ) : it has experienced similar episodes in the past and it will probably repeat them in the future .",
    "besides 2006  rh@xmath13 , the only other object that has been involved in temporary capture events as defined by granvik et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is 2009  bd but only during a few days ; both objects have the lowest values of @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of this dynamical group provides a natural source for the so - called earth s irregular natural satellites .",
    "our analysis suggests that many other objects currently in the neighbourhood of the volume of the orbital parameter space described above ( see fig .",
    "[ region ] , grey areas ) may be former members of this dynamical group , like 1991  vg , or may join it in the future .",
    "it is not surprising that this dynamically cold family has not been reported earlier .",
    "hidden in plain sight , all the proposed members in table [ members ] have been discovered during the last decade .",
    "they are small or very small objects with typical maximum apparent magnitude not less than 18 and can only be observed when they get close to the earth , every 5080 yr ( twice per horseshoe period ) , remaining within 0.5 au from the earth for about 510 yr with typical minimum distances of 0.01 au . only during these favourable windows of opportunity are these objects relatively easy to observe , easily accessible , and have risk of impact . in terms of observability ,",
    "the situation is even worst for the kozai resonators as they never get that close to the earth ( see fig .",
    "[ 2012fc71 ] ) and encounters typically occur every 55 yr ; if all of them are like 2012  fc@xmath4 or smaller , then the vast majority are well beyond reach of current neo surveys and they may be very numerous .",
    "although the objects described here have sizes in the range 250 m , they are still large enough to provoke a significant amount of local destruction if they enter the atmosphere . on the positive side , these objects are also the ideal targets ( see @xmath14 in table [ members ] , @xmath14 is the minimum total variation of speed for transferring from low - earth orbit to rendezvous with the object , the equivalent @xmath14 to reach the moon is 6 km s@xmath15 ) for commercial mining of minerals in outer space ( e.g. , lee 2012 ) .",
    "they can also be used to reach the far side of earth s orbit , the lagrangian point l@xmath16 , at basically no cost .",
    "this has multiple astronomical applications for solar - powered , fully automated observatories .",
    "these observations can enable the study of the neo population from the inside , finding about possible impactors well before they get close enough to become a threat .",
    "in their way to l@xmath16 , these objects also visit l@xmath17 and l@xmath18 where primordial material in the form of dynamically cold , very small trojans may still be trapped . instead of using the moon as an extraterrestrial astronomical observatory",
    ", they represent a much cheaper and flexible alternative .",
    "minor bodies moving in orbits with low - eccentricity , low - inclination and earth - like period are sometimes called arjuna asteroids ( lewis 1996 ; lee 2012 ) .",
    "further observations are needed to expand the list of objects moving in arjuna - type orbits .",
