    "recently , in refs .  @xcite a method has been developed that allows one to obtain analytical approximations with arbitrary precision to a large class of integrals appearing in many diverse physical problems .",
    "the method is based on a carefully chosen expansion , which has been shown to converge uniformly and gives excellent results already at first order . in refs .",
    "@xcite such method has been applied to a few problems in classical mechanics and general relativity , allowing one to obtain simple analytical formulas that work even in the non - perturbative regime . in this paper",
    "we consider a further application of the method , showing that it is possible to obtain accurate _ analytical _ expressions for the spectrum of a quantum potential by using it in conjunction with the wkb expansion .",
    "wkb is a semi - classical approximation , whose accuracy improves for large quantum numbers , based on an expansion in @xmath0 of the schrdinger equation : it has been widely used in the past to get approximate evaluations of the spectra of quantum potentials and it is generally employed at the leading order in @xmath0 , although its extension at higher orders has allowed one to recover , in special cases , the exact energy eigenvalues @xcite . on the other hand , for a generic potential function @xmath1 the calculation of the wkb correction to a given order can be done only numerically and , in general , no analytical expression can be found for the wkb integrals and , as a consequence , for the spectrum .",
    "the wkb method has already been employed also in the specific case of the phenomenological quark - antiquark potentials , using both non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite kinematics , showing a remarkably good accuracy even for the lowest quantum numbers . however , the solution of the wkb equation , although simpler than the original schrdinger equation , has been again done numerically and only in the limit of large quantum numbers it has been possible to obtain the spectrum in a closed form .    in this paper , by applying the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the calculation of the wkb integrals we show that one can obtain an accurate _ analytical _ approximation to the _ full spectrum _ of the potential ( see also ref .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation depends both on the order to which the wkb expansion is considered and on the order to which our method is applied .",
