    "in nearly one decade of optical and infrared studies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , it has been established that at least a large fraction of long - duration grbs is directly connected with the death of massive stars .",
    "most evidence arises from observations of supernova ( sn ) features in the spectra of a handful of grb afterglows .",
    "examples of the spectroscopic sn / grb connection include sn1998bw / grb980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , sn2003dh / grb030329 ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ) , sn2003lw / grb031203 ( malesani et al . 2004 ) , sn2002lt / grb021211 ( della valle et al . 2003 ) , xrf020903 with a broad - line type - ib / c sn ( soderberg et al . 2005 ) , and the recent sn2006aj / grb060218 ( masetti et al . 2006 ; fatkthullin et al . 2006",
    "; campana et al . 2006 ; modjaz et al .",
    "in addition there are about a dozen afterglows which show rebrightenings and/or flattenings in their light curve days to weeks after the gamma - ray event ( e.g. bloom et al .",
    "1999 ; zeh et al .",
    "these bumps are interpreted as due to the emergence of sn .",
    "most of these studies are based upon photometric data , due to the extreme faintness of late - time afterglows .",
    "there is some evidence that the population of sne associated with grbs is quite heterogeneous : several bumps have light curves which are well matched by faint sne ( e.g. grb011121 : garnavich et al .",
    "2003 , bloom et al . 2002 ; xrf030723 : fynbo et al . 2004 ; grb020410 : levan et al . 2005 ; xrf040701 : soderberg et al .",
    "2005 ) , rather than bright `` hypernovae '' such as sn1998bw .",
    "however , only spectroscopic observations can definitely assess the degree of `` diversity '' among grb progenitors .",
    "moreover , dust echos ( e.g. esin & blandford 2000 ; waxman & draine 2000 ) can produce red late - time ` rebrightenings ' resembling sn bumps , and spectroscopy is the most effective way to identify their nature . despite the intense interest in detailing the diversity of grb - sne , only one association with a _ swift _",
    "burst has been reported to date ( grb060218/sn2006aj ) .",
    "this is very likely due to the higher redshifts of _ swift _ bursts ( @xmath2 ; jakobsson et al .",
    "2006 ) compared with pre-_swift _ events . in particular , only about 10% of the almost 100 _ swift _ bursts have occured at redshift less than one . at redshifts @xmath3 , sne",
    "are almost impossible to detect with current instrumentation .",
    "thus , the discovery of low - redshift grbs is a critical gateway for the study of grb - sne . in this _",
    "letter _ , we detail the measurement of the redshift of grb050525a and present the discovery of an extra component in its late afterglow , together with spectroscopic evidence for an associated sn . this sn was dubbed sn2005nc @xcite .",
    "the long - duration grb050525a was discovered by the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) on 2005 may 25.002 ut ( band et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it was a bright event , with fluence @xmath4  erg  @xmath5 and duration @xmath6  s ( this is the time during which 90% of the photons are collected ) .",
    "the burst was observed also by numerous other satellites ( integral : gtz et al .",
    "2005 ; _ wind _ : golenetskii et al .",
    "2005 ; rhessi ; mars odyssey ) , allowing for a detailed study of the high energy prompt emission spectrum .",
    "the optical afterglow was soon discovered by the rotse - iii robotic telescope ( rykoff et al .",
    "2005a ) , as a bright , fading source at @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( rykoff et al .",
    "the optical and x - ray counterparts were also monitored in great detail by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) onboard _ swift _ ( blustin et al .",
    "the brightness of the afterglow allowed an intense monitoring of this object , from optical ( e.g. klotz et al . 2005 ; mirabal et al . 2005 ) to radio frequencies ( cameron & frail 2005 ) , including the first detection of a grb at mid - infrared wavelengths ( 3.6 to 24  @xmath9 m ; garnavich et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "a spectrum of the afterglow was obtained with the gemini north telescope equipped with the gmos instrument .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift was measured through both emission and absorption lines , yielding @xmath10 ( foley et al . 2005 ; see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is at the low end of the grb redshift distribution ( bloom et al .",
    "2003 , berger et al .",
    "2005 , jakobsson et al .",
    "2006 ) and is the third lowest redshift _ swift _ long - duration grb aside grb050803 ( bloom et al .",
    "2006 ) and the recent grb060218 ( mirabal & halpern 2006 ) .",
    "this event therefore presents a good opportunity for detailed analysis and modelling .",
    "we observed the optical afterglow of grb050525a with the vlt and tng telescopes , during the period 2005 may - september ( from a few hours up to @xmath11  d after the gamma - ray event , see fig .  2 ) .",
    "data reduction was carried out following standard procedures .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved by observing several standard star fields on different nights , yielding a zeropoint accuracy of @xmath12  mag .",
    "photometric data ( fig .  2 ) show a flattening of the light curve at @xmath13 , starting about 5  d after the burst ( observer rest frame ) and lasting for about 20  d. the contribution of the host galaxy during this phase is @xmath14 , as estimated from our late - epoch images which show the host magnitude is fainter than @xmath15 . the afterglow contribution , as extrapolated from the earlier measurement , is negligible at these epochs ( @xmath16 at 20  d after the grb ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the flattening is powered by an additional source of energy . to further quantify this",
    ", we fitted the observed light curve including the contribution from the afterglow ( a broken power law ) , the host galaxy , and a sn component : @xmath17^{1/\\kappa } }         + f_{\\rm h } + f_{\\rm sn}[s(t - t_0)].\\ ] ] here @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( the early- and late - time slopes ) and @xmath20 ( the break time ) characterize the afterglow decay ( @xmath21 determines how sharp is the break ) . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the host galaxy and the sn flux , respectively .",
    "we allowed for a time offset @xmath24 between the sn and the grb , for a temporal stretch @xmath25 in the light curve , and for a magnitude difference . for the sn flux",
    ", we adopted the light curves of several type - ic sne ( sn1998bw : galama et al .",
    "1998 ; sn2002ap : yoshii et al .",
    "2003 , pandey et al .",
    "2003 , gal - yam et al .",
    "2002 , foley et al . 2003 ; sn1994i : richmond et al .",
    "our approach is similar to that adopted by zeh et al .",
    "the afterglow component is well fitted with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  d. interpreting the break as due to a jet effect , this value of @xmath20 makes grb050525a consistent with the ghirlanda relation ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004 ; nava et al .",
    "2005 ) . in fig .  2",
    ", the solid line shows the best fit using sn1998bw as a template , dimmed by 0.9  mag .",
    "the galactic extinction towards grb050525a is @xmath29  mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "the extinction inside the grb host is uncertain .",
    "blustin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest @xmath30 assuming an smc extinction curve , so that the observed @xmath31 band ( roughly corresponding to the rest - frame @xmath32 ) suffers an additional @xmath33  mag .",
    "this implies that the sn associated with grb050525a may have a luminosity just about 0.3  mag fainter than sn1998bw .",
    "however fits of comparable quality ( both in terms of visual appearance and @xmath34 ) can be obtained by assuming other sn templates .",
    "figure  [ fg : lc_bump ] shows fits obtained with the hypernova sn2002ap ( brightened by 1.3 mag ) and the `` standard '' type - ic sn1994i ( brightened by 1.8  mag ) .",
    "finally , we note that the best matches to the data points are obtained by allowing a time offset between a 1998bw - like sn and the grb of @xmath35  d ( corresponding to @xmath36  d in the grb rest frame ) or a time stretch factor @xmath37 . these fits",
    "reproduce the flat shape of the rebrightening .",
    "a more exotic scenario calls for the effect of a light echo .",
    "indeed , sudden flattenings have been observed in the light curves of sne due to the occurrence of light - echo components ( e.g. schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ; cappellaro et al .",
    "2001 ; quinn et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) during the late sn decline .",
    "however in these cases the flattenings were characterized by much longer evolutionary time scales ( @xmath38700  d ) than is observed for grb afterglow bumps ( @xmath3920  d ) . in the sn 1991 t echo - light ,",
    "the spectrum at late stages was similar to that emitted by the sn at maximum light , although about 10 mag fainter . in our case , if the bump was due to an echo , we would expect to observe , in the spectrum obtained during the flattening , the signatures ( at considerably fainter level of luminosity ) of the very early optical afterglow .",
    "all of this indicates that a good set of photometric data _ alone _ may not constrain the sn type unambiguously .",
    "this task can be tackled only by means of spectroscopic observations .",

    "the dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines indicate the afterglow , the host galaxy , and the sn contributions , respectively.[fg : lc_all ] ]     the vertical dotted line represents the epoch of the spectrum . ]",
    "a spectrum was obtained at the eso vlt - ut1 with the fors2 instrument on 2005 jun 28 ( 36  d after the burst , observer frame ) . the original spectrum ( @xmath40  min integration ) covered the range 500010000   with a resolution of @xmath41   .",
    "the extraction of the spectrum was performed inside the iraf and midas environments .",
    "this spectrum , shown in the rest - frame of the grb as a grey line ( fig .",
    "[ fg : spec_sn ] ) , was smoothed with a 100   wide boxcar filter ( blue line ) and cleaned from the host galaxy emission features . as indicated by the light curve",
    ", this spectrum contains a significant contribution from the host galaxy .",
    "we thus subtracted from our spectrum a template of a blue star - forming galaxy ( black line ) , normalized to the host brightness and @xmath42 color . the use of a template ( average of 70 blue star - forming galaxies , from cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ) , was necessary due to the faintness of the host galaxy .",
    "an unsuccessful attempt to get its spectrum with vlt was made on 2005 oct 1 .",
    "this observation allowed us to set a robust upper limit to the magnitude of the host ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the use of a blue star - forming galaxy template is fully justified by several studies , which allow to conclude that grb hosts belong to this type of systems ( e.g. djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ; fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ; le floch et al . 2003 ; christensen et al .",
    "the resulting spectrum ( red line ) is characterized by broad undulations resembling the spectra of sn1998bw ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ) , obtained @xmath44  d past maximum ( green line ) .",
    "the best match is obtained by dimming sn1998bw by @xmath45 mag shifts the date of the best match with sn1998bw by about 2  d later and earlier , respectively . ] .",
    "the bump at @xmath46   has some contribution from residuals of sky emissions that we were unable to remove . for comparison",
    ", we also show the spectrum of sn1998bw @xmath39  d past maximum ( cyan line ) .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fg : spec_sn ] reveals a poor match with the observed data , suggesting that sn2005nc was not far from maximum when the spectrum was acquired .",
    "this result does not support the best fit to the photometric data , which suggested either a time lag between the sn and the grb or a stretch factor @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , in these cases the spectrum would have been obtained about 10  d ( rest frame ) past maximum , which is excluded by spectroscopic observations ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . spectra of sn 1994i ( filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ) obtained close to maximum light also do not match the observed spectrum .",
    "green line : spectrum of sn1998bw 5d past maximum .",
    "cyan line : spectrum of sn1998bw 10d past maximum.[fg : spec_sn ] ]",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rebrightening associated with grb050525a support the idea that the bump was powered by an emerging sn ( sn2005nc ) .",
    "while photometric data alone are consistent ( within the errors ) with different sn morphologies ( based on either sn1998bw , sn2002ap , or sn1994i templates ) , the analysis of the spectrum obtained during the bump allowed us to select a sn akin to sn1998bw as the best match , possibly dimmed by @xmath48  mag .",
    "the flat shape of the bump light curve implies that sn2005nc brightened relatively quickly after the grb , with a rise time @xmath4912  d in the @xmath32 band ( for sn1998bw , @xmath50 ) .",
    "this can be explained either by introducing a significant stretch factor ( @xmath51 ) or a time lag between the sn and the grb .",
    "both possibilities would imply that at the epoch of our spectrum ( 36  d after the grb ) the sn provided a very small contribution to the observed light .",
    "this is inconsistent with our observations , which suggest that the sn and the host galaxy had comparable brightness ( @xmath52 ) at that epoch .",
    "we thus conclude that sn2005nc had a different light curve from the templates we adopted .",
    "differences among grb - sne were noticed before the present study ( e.g. cobb et al .",
    "we find that the sn associated with 050525a had a faster rise than sn1998bw , but that it was characterized by a broader , long - lasting maximum . on the other hand maeda",
    "( 2005 ) showed that asymmetric sne peak earlier if observed close to their polar axis .",
    "grb050525a was a bright event , likely observed on - axis . on the contrary ,",
    "sn1998bw may have been observed off - axis ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2003 ) , so that an earlier peak for sn2005nc could be expected in this scenario . in spite of the putative existence of a broad range in the magnitudes at maximum of sne associated with grbs , all grb - associated sne which have so far had spectroscopic confirmation ( see della valle 2006 and woosley & bloom 2006 for reviews ) appear to belong to the bright tail of the type - ib / c sn population ( all objects mentioned in the introduction have @xmath53 ) . whether this is the effect of an observational bias ( which favors the spectroscopic observations of bright sne ) operating on a small number of objects , or whether it has a deeper physical meaning is not yet clear . in this paper",
    "we have found a new case of association between a grb and a bright hypernova , both on robust photometric grounds and spectroscopic evidence . on the other hand to prove _ beyond doubt _ the existence of a class of grb - associated sne having spectroscopic properties dramatically different from those exhibited by the prototypical hypernova sn1998bw still remains one of the most important observational challanges for the sn / grb community , that _ swift _ will hopefully allow us to address in the near future .",
