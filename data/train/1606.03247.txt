    "high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) in the quasi - two - dimensional cuprates is regarded as a fundamental phenomenon because of a number of reasons@xcite .",
    "we name just a few here .",
    "first , by doping the system with holes ( cf . fig . [ fig:0 ] ) , a series of quantum phase transitions appears , starting from an antiferromagnetic mott - hubbard insulator ( afi ) for the doping @xmath4 @xcite , through the hts phase ( often mixed with other phases up to an almost optimal doping@xcite ) , to the normal fermi - liquid - like state for @xmath5 @xcite . on microscopic level , in the high-@xmath3 regime hts disappears , most likely by a pair - correlation dilution in real space concomitant with an increased single - particle hopping via hole states .",
    "second , when the doping is low , the pairing also weakens and the non - bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( non - bcs ) character of hts shows up @xcite in the form of the kinetic energy gain at the transition , which exemplifies the fact that the electronic - correlation effects are the strongest there .",
    "third , the electronic spectrum in the nodal direction ( @xmath6 in the two - dimensional brillouin zone ) exhibits a universal character@xcite .",
    "namely , in spite of changing the carrier concentration by doping ( which normally should lead to the corresponding changes in the fermi - surface volume ) , the value of the fermi velocity in the nodal direction remains almost unchanged in the whole doping range , where various phases such as superconducting , magnetically or charge - ordered can appear .",
    "fourth , the effective mass in the nodal direction also exhibits a universal behavior@xcite .",
    "these crucial features are regarded as representative to all the cuprate superconductors and our principal aim here is to address these and related properties in a fully quantitative manner .",
    "it is accepted that the coper - oxide ( cuo@xmath7 ) planes which appear in the crystal structure of hts are instrumental for achieving a stable paired phase@xcite .",
    "that is why the theoretical analysis of the cuprates often limits to models which describe a single cuo@xmath7@xcite plane .",
    "within such an approach one can eliminate the oxygen degrees - of - freedom via the zhang - rice singlet hypothesis @xcite or by perturbation expansion@xcite , which leads to an effective single - band model of correlated @xmath8 electrons due to cu atoms on a square lattice ( cf .",
    "one of the canonical models for the description within the paradigm of strong correlations is the t - j model,@xcite in which hts appears in the range @xmath9 in a natural manner already within the _ renormalized mean field theory _ rmft@xcite , also with the so - called _ statistical consistency constraints _ included explicitly ( sga method @xcite ) .",
    "the rmft approach in the sga version can be related directly to the slave - boson method @xcite ( for review see refs . ) .",
    "however , within the gutzwiller - type approach no extra bose fields are required , as the interelectronic correlations are evaluated directly .",
    "another model which is used in the theoretical analysis of hts is the single - band hubbard model which however requires more sophisticated calculation methods than rmft to obtain the paired phase stability .",
    "the difference between the approach based on the @xmath0-@xmath1 model and the one that starts from the hubbard model is that in the former case the intersite pairing corrections are included already via kinetic exchange whereas in the latter model one has to introduce them by including correlations beyond rmft , as discussed also below .",
    "recently , the full gutzwiller wave - function ( gwf ) solution for the superconducting state for both the @xmath0-@xmath1 @xcite and the hubbard@xcite models have been reported , in which rmft ( in the sga form ) , appears as the zeroth- order approximation to the full solution . within this approach",
    "one can track down the evolution of the results , by using the so - called diagrammatic expansion method@xcite ( de - gwf ) , starting from the mean - field theory as the zeroth order result and proceed with incorporating systematically the nonlocal correlations of increased range in higher orders .",
    "in such a manner , the exact gwf description is approached asymptotically step by step .    here",
    "we apply the gwf solution to analyze the current approaches of strongly correlated electrons and single out the so - called @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model which may be regarded as an extended @xmath0-@xmath1 model with a relatively strong kinetic exchange and the direct coulomb interactions included at the same time .",
    "such combination of seemingly excluding each other processes requires a brief elaboration provided in the appendix .",
    "however , one should note st the start , that as the exchange interactions are coming mainly from the interband @xmath10-@xmath11 processes , they are related only indirectly to the split - hubbard - subband structure of 3@xmath10 states due to copper@xcite . as shown earlier , the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model description leads to the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase stability for @xmath12@xcite , which is in rough agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "the appearance of both the af exchange interaction and the direct coulomb interaction within such approach brings into mind the competition between the spin - density - wave phase and the charge - density wave phase , the latter of which has been discovered in the cuprates recently@xcite . with the de - gwf solution we not only reproduce the results of the variational quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite , sometimes with a better accuracy , but",
    "also carry out calculations for infinite systems within a reasonable computing time .",
    "this last factor allowed us to test a number of theoretical models ( @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath13 , hubbard ) and single out the one which reproduces quantitatively the principal experimental data .    in brief , the principal aim of this paper is to confront the results obtained for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 and related models with the experimental data for the hts state in a proper quantitative manner .",
    "explicitly , our purpose here is threefold : * ( i ) * not only to make a detailed comparison of selected experiments with theory , but first and foremost , to single out the universal characteristics such as fermi velocity @xmath14 , effective mass @xmath15 , fermi wave vector @xmath16 , and the non - bcs feature of the pairing , * ( ii ) * characterize whole class of theoretical single - band models based on strong correlations among the electrons and single out the one that allows for a quantitative predictions of selected dynamic properties ( at least within the de - gwf solution ) , and * ( iii ) * to demonstrate the indispensability of the approach going beyond any current mean field approach ( rmft ) on the example of de - gwf .    from the formal point of view",
    ", we have reanalyzed the origin of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model@xcite .",
    "namely , since the principal contribution to the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath1 comes from superexchange via @xmath17 states and the value of hubbard interaction @xmath2 to the bare bandwidth is not too high , @xmath18 , we have extended the concept of @xmath0-@xmath1 model by incorporating expilictly the coulomb interaction , allowing a small number of double occupancies , in addition to having a rather high value of @xmath1 what leads to the effective single - band model in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 or even even @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath13 form .",
    "the relevant microscopic interaction parameters of the starting model are schematically defined in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .",
    "the intersite coulomb interaction @xmath19 has been disregarded in the main text , but its role is elaborated briefly in the concluding section . here , we concentrate only on the quantitative analysis of the pure superconducting ( sc ) phase . important issues which also can be tackled within the present approach , i.e. , the description of electrodynamics in an applied magnetic field , are listed at the end .",
    "the starting model is of the form of the extended hubbard hamiltonian with the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction@xcite @xmath20 where the primed summation means that @xmath21 and @xmath22 means that only pairs of nearest neighbors are taken into account .",
    "the first two terms represent the hubbard model ( consisting of the hopping and the intrasite repulsion terms , respectively ) , the third expresses the intersite coulomb interaction ( the part @xmath23 comes from the full expression for the exchange operator ) , and the last accounts for the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( in the strict one - band representation of correlated electrons the exchange integral is @xmath24 @xcite ) . in the bulk of the paper",
    "we have disregarded the third term , as it does not influence much the quality of the comparison with the discussed here experimental data ( see the discussion at the end of the paper ) .",
    "we should note that such a model has been introduced formally in ref . as interpolating between the hubbard- and @xmath0-@xmath1-model limits .",
    "the general form of the single - band model with all two - site interactions would require the inclusion of the pair - hopping and the so - called correlated hopping terms@xcite .",
    "however , those two terms should be small as @xmath2 is relatively large ; an additional check on their very small relevance , as well as of the three - site terms@xcite , eventually comes from the quality of our quantitative description of selected experimental results .",
    "the main task within our approach is to calculate the ground state energy and its properties for the full gutzwiller - wave - function solution .",
    "this is carried out in a direct analogy to an earlier treatment of both the hubbard@xcite and the t - j models@xcite .",
    "explicitly , the ground state energy per lattice site is of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath27 is the gutzwiller - type wave function , defined with the help of the operator @xmath28 and the normalized uncorrelated state , @xmath29 ( taken as the uncorrelated paired state with nonzero anomalous real space average @xmath30 , for @xmath21 , when considering the sc phase ) .",
    "the @xmath28 operator is of the form @xmath31 where the variational parameters @xmath32 correspond to four states from the local basis @xmath33 , respectively . in our analysis",
    "we assume spatial homogeneity , so @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we also limit to the spin - isotropic case , which means that @xmath35 .    within the diagrammatic expansion method@xcite one imposes the condition that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is yet another variational parameter and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "all the @xmath41 parameters can be expressed with the use of the @xmath37 parameter due to ( [ eq : constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : gutz_operator ] ) , which means that we are left with only one variational parameter in the considered case .",
    "the expectation values of the consecutive terms which appear in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_start ] ) ( we omit the intersite coulomb repulsion term here ) can be expressed in the form of the power series @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the primmed summation on the right hand side has the restrictions @xmath46 , @xmath47 for all @xmath11 , @xmath48 .",
    "next , by using the wicks theorem the non - correlated averages in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : expectation_val_terms ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . due to the fact that the gutzwiller operator may change the norm of the noncorrelated wave function , one has to divide the above expressions by @xmath51 , while calculating the ground state energy .",
    "it is convenient to use the linked - cluster theorem@xcite to simplify the expressions obtained in the described manner .",
    "such approach allows us to evaluate the ground state energy to a sufficient accuracy by including the first @xmath52 orders of the diagrammatic expansion@xcite , depending on the model at hand .    from the minimization condition of the ground state energy ( [ eq : ground_state_energy ] )",
    "one can derive the effective hamiltonian , which for the case of pure superconducting phase has the form @xmath53 where the effective hopping and the effective superconducting gap parameters are defined through the corresponding relations @xmath54 for @xmath55 , the @xmath56 has an interpretation of an effective chemical potential .",
    "the expression for ground state energy functional per atomic site @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the chemical potential and the number of particles per lattice site determined in the correlated state , respectively ) is obtained via the corresponding diagrammatic expansions of all the averages contained in it .",
    "it should be noted that within this approach one can also calculate the correlated superconducting gap parameter @xmath60 , which is analyzed in the main text .",
    "namely , the correlated and the effective gaps are expressed through the uncorrelated quantities @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and the variational parameter @xmath37 . in result , one has to solve a set of integral equations for @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath58 , and @xmath37 , from which the electronic structure , the correlated gap @xmath64 , and the ground state energy are explicitly evaluated for given set of parameters @xmath65 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and the band filling @xmath66 .",
    "some methodological remarks are in place here .",
    "namely , the application of the wicks theorem allows us to express the elements of the sums in ( [ eq : expectation_val_terms ] ) as diagrams with the lattice sites playing the role of vertices and @xmath61 , @xmath62 being the edges connecting those vertices . in the obtained diagrammatic sums the site indices @xmath67 run over all the lattice sites .",
    "however , the @xmath61 and @xmath62 with significantly large distance @xmath68 lead to small contributions@xcite .",
    "therefore , during the calculations one may limit to terms with lines that correspond to distances smaller than some @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to introduce additional condition that a given diagram contribution is included in the calculations if the sum of all the lines length ( in the manhattan metrics ) which correspond to this diagram is smaller than some specified value @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , beginning from some particular value of the expansion order @xmath71 one can neglect the terms of the summation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : expectation_val_terms ] ) .",
    "in such situation one includes diagrams with number of vertices up to @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) corresponding to one- ( two- ) site terms of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_start ] ) .",
    "the order of the approach is then equal to @xmath74 . in practice , it is convenient to include diagrams with number of lines up to some particular value , @xmath75 . it should be noted that including only the zeroth - order diagrams leads to calculations which are equivalent to the sga version of the renormalized mean - field theory .",
    "all the presented results have been obtained for the calculation parameters set to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 means that we include diagrams up to the fifth order and some additional diagrams which are of the sixth order .",
    "the set of integral equations for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath58 , and @xmath37 has been solved with the use of gsl numerical library with the typical accuracy set to @xmath79 .",
    "in our analysis we take into account both the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor hoppings , with the respective hopping integrals set to @xmath80 ev ( the value @xmath81 is taken as the energy unit , if not specified explicitly ) and @xmath82 . the intersite exchange integral",
    "is assumed as nonzero only for the nearest - neighbors @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "below we analyze concrete measurable quantities and compare them o experiment in a quantitative manner .      to set the stage - reference point of our analysis in fig .",

    "the universal fermi velocity @xmath14 in the nodal direction is estimated from the data by taking the slopes of the extreme curves as marked by the straight lines , what leads to the average result @xmath88 ev@xmath89(in these units @xmath90 , in physical units @xmath91 cm / s ) .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the one determined theoretically here ( see below ) @xmath92 ev , what illustrates the quality of our approach , the results of which we discuss in detail next .    to single out the model which describes properly the high temperature superconductivity , we have analyzed the hubbard , @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 , and @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath13 models separately , all within the full gutzwiller wave function solution ( the parameters are visualized in fig .",

    "nonetheless , it is impossible to fit the experimental data@xcite with a reasonable value of @xmath1 .",
    "one should note that for @xmath106 and @xmath107 the non - bcs behaviour appears in the whole doping range of the paired state stability , as we show at the end of this section ( cf .",

    "@xmath3 one can draw a very important conclusion .",
    "namely , the electronic structure in the nodal direction has a universal character in the sense that it survives the effect of the shrinking of the fermi surface with the diminishing carrier ( hole ) concentration .",
    "note also that the value of @xmath14 is the same , independently of the circumstance that other phases or pseudogap may appear in the system .",
    "thus , these subsidiary phenomena must also have a gap node in that direction , in which @xmath14 has been determined , so they do not influence directly the dispersion - relation gradient at @xmath129 .      in fig .",

    "one should note that the fermi velocity and the fermi wave vector are in direct relation to the effective mass through the relation @xmath133 , which allows us to determine the dynamical value of @xmath15 ( black inverted triangles ) by using arpes measurements of @xmath16 ( taken from ref . ) and @xmath14 ( taken from ref . ) .",
    "note the differences between the two experimental data sets for @xmath15 corresponding to lsco ( blue dots and black inverted triangles ) . nevertheless , one universal feature of the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:35]b is clearly visible .",
    "namely , the effective mass in the nodal direction is almost constant , and if we ignore the upper data set , the value is @xmath134 , which is in very good agreement with our theoretical results within the gwf solution for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "this value corresponds to the maximal value of @xmath135 determined recently for ybco@xcite , where its distinct non - universal dependence has been observed .",
    "the question arises as to what extent the dome - like behavior shown in ref .",
    "can be related to charge - density - wave evolution in strong applied field .",
    "we have discussed already that the gain in the hopping ( kinetic ) energy is one of the crucial features differentiating between real - space - pairing models and singling out the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model as the one that leads to a better agreement with experiment . however , according to the cdmft calculations@xcite also the @xmath0-@xmath1 model gives some similar results in this respect ( although they have not compared their results quantitatively to experiment ) . the agreement shown by us ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , [ fig:3_1 ] , [ fig:35 ] ) is achieved only if the high - energy scale ( with @xmath136 ev ) , which is about three times larger than the bare bandwidth ( @xmath137 ev ) , is included in the analysis . to illustrate the role of such a high - energy resonant level , located at @xmath138 ev",
    ", we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a the value of @xmath64 and @xmath139 , both as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the small value of @xmath140 , speaks in favor of the interpretation that the states in the upper hubbard subband may play minor but still relevant role of high - energy resonant states .",
    "this circumstance can be put in accord with the canonical approach based on the split hubbard subbands which are reproduced within the three band model - the original model describing the cu - o plane , as discussed in appendix . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b we show the doping dependence of the variational parameter @xmath37 , which is introduced in the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) , also for the case of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model . for the half - filled situation",
    "we obtain the value @xmath141 , which corresponds to no double occupancy , in spite of having a finite value of the hubbard @xmath2 . this particular value of @xmath37 results from the fact that for the case with @xmath107 we have @xmath142 which leads directly to the relation @xmath143 ( cf . section model and method as well as ref . ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 both in the @xmath144 limit and for the half - filled case with the finite @xmath2 leads to the results equivalent to the one obtained for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c we provide @xmath105 vs @xmath3 for the limiting case @xmath106 and @xmath145 , which may be regarded as the @xmath144 limit of both the hubbard and the @xmath0-@xmath1 models .",
    "one can see that even though the general shape of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c is the same as that obtained for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model ( cf .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) , the corresponding values of @xmath146 are smaller by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , only by combining the two factors , nonzero @xmath147 ( finite @xmath2 ) and a relatively large value of @xmath1 , one can bring the theory in the quantitative accord with experiment , at least within the gutzwiller wave function solution .",
    "this required a generalization of the ideas of kinetic exchange as it comes out from a direct perturbation expansion of the hubbard model@xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "the fundamental question concerning the model is whether other methods of approach ( vmc , dmft and others ) can be applied to it and confirm the presented here results obtained within the de - gwf method .",
    "the affirmative answer to this question would constitute , in our view , a basis for comprehensive treatment of the pairing as applied to high temperature superconductors and other strongly correlated systems .",
    "the results presented in figs . [ fig:1 ] - [ fig:35 ]",
    "provide a consistent analysis for the same set of model parameters of the principal experimental properties of the cuprates within the combined concepts of real space pairing and strong interelectronic correlations .",
    "in carrying out our analysis we had to go beyond the renormalized mean field theory ( even in its statistically consistent version , sga@xcite ) , i.e. , discuss the results within the full gutzwiller wave function solution ( gwf ) to a relatively high order of the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "in particular , we have explained here the following ground - state characteristics : * ( i ) * the doping ( @xmath3 ) independence of the fermi velocity @xmath14 in the nodal direction , * ( ii ) * the kinetic energy gain in the sc phase @xmath105 , one of the main non - bcs features , * ( iii ) * the optimal doping value @xmath148 , * ( iv ) * the upper critical concentration for disappearance of the hts state , @xmath149 , and * ( v ) * the doping dependence of the fermi wave vector , @xmath150 .",
    "additionally , we have extracted the @xmath3 dependence of effective mass enhancement from the experimental data concerning @xmath150 and @xmath151 and have shown that @xmath152 agrees well with that obtained theoretically , as well as that determined from an independent experiments .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model taken at the start requires a slight modification of our thinking about hts as doped mott insulators in terms of either the hubbard or the original @xmath0-@xmath1 models @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "one formal point of the model should be noted here .",
    "namely , the antiferromagnetic exchange is quite strong and must be coming from the @xmath153 superexchange via the antibonding @xmath154 states due to oxygen , as stated many times earlier @xcite . in effect , as the fitting to the experimental data provides us a posteriori with the hubbard interaction to the bare band - width ratio @xmath155 , the electronic correlations in the effective narrow band may not be regarded as extremely strong , particularly for @xmath156 , what results also in having a small but relevant double occupancy probability @xmath140 .",
    "the presence of the hubbard interaction term introduces in an explicit form the high energy scale @xmath157 ev to the problem , what results in comparable values of the effective coulomb energy @xmath158 mev and the exchange energy @xmath159 mev .",
    "moreover , the kinetic energy in the pm state , is also of the same order , @xmath160 mev for @xmath161 , constituting altogether a truly correlated state , in which all the three factors play a role . in connection with taking finite @xmath2 value",
    "it should be noted that the holon - doublon correction to the gutzwiller wave - function have also been considered @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see the connection between that extension and our approach .",
    "in our considerations we have disregarded the intersite coulomb repulsion ( the third term of eq .",
    "[ eq : h_start ] ) ) , as it does not influence much the quality of the comparison with the discussed here experimental data .",
    "explicitly , the lsco data displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig:3]a and [ fig:3_1 ] can be also fitted with the set of parameters : @xmath80ev , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , i.e. with @xmath166 . in effect , @xmath167 is small and can safely be disregarded here .",
    "however , the role of @xmath13 may become important when charge- and spin - density - wave states are included , but that requires a separate analysis@xcite .",
    "we have not addressed at all the system thermodynamical properties .",
    "the extension to the temperature @xmath168 is indispensable as the next step . in this respect , particularly important is the question of the pseudogap appearance@xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to ask whether the pseudogap is partly connected with the evolution of our effective gap @xmath169 in the antinodal direction or is it due to a different physical mechanism@xcite .",
    "a possible connection between the effective gap and the measured gap in the antinodal direction is supported by the intriguing coincidence that both of them increase with the decreasing doping@xcite .",
    "a similar behavior has already been obtained within sga by taking the bare ( not gutzwiller - projected ) value of the gap magnitude and fitting it to the experiment@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of other phases , such as spin- and charge - density - wave states on the superconducting phase diagram depicted in fig . [ fig:2_1 ] should be treated separately , together with singling out the role of the intersite coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the consistent scheme of analyzing concrete , though selected data for high-@xmath170 sc phase is not the last word by any means , also due to the following reasons . it would be interesting to compare the present results with those of other methods , which also go beyond the renormalized mean field theory .",
    "for example , an application of the plaquette or cluster dynamic mean - field theory@xcite to the present model could be of principal importance as an independent checkout on the validity of higher order corrections to rmft .",
    "furthermore , an extension of our approach to the situation with nonzero applied magnetic field would provide additional physical properties ( e.g. , doping dependence of the penetration depth ) for a further quantitative testing of the present approach .",
    "we should be able to see progress along these lines in the near future .",
    "the authors are grateful for the financial support of the national science centre ( ncn ) through grant maestro , no .",
    "dec-2012/04/a / st3/00342 . the discussions with profs .",
    "dirk van der marel from universit de geneve , adam kamiski from the iowa state university and the ames lab . ,",
    "iowa , and alexander kordyuk from the national academy of ukraine , were useful and enlightening .",
    "we would like to estimate the physical relevance of the considered here @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model . in the canonically transformed extended hubbard model@xcite the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is of the form @xmath171 and therefore no hubbard extra term should appear@xcite , if we are in the strong - correlation limit @xmath172 ( not only @xmath173 ) .",
    "namely , the contribution to the @xmath26-particle wave function coming from double occupancies is of the order of @xmath174@xcite . before discussing the application of that limit in real calculations ,",
    "let us estimate its value by taking the standard microscopic - parameter : @xmath175ev , @xmath176ev , and @xmath177 .",
    "when neglecting @xmath13 in above formula for @xmath178 we obtain the value of @xmath179k at most .",
    "if the bare parameter @xmath13 is taken as @xmath180 ( maximum ) , then the value of @xmath1 increases by @xmath181 , which is still much lower than the typical value of measured @xmath182ev@xmath183k in the insulating phase@xcite ( note that here the values of @xmath1 are @xmath184 of those for the full exchange as there is no factor @xmath184 before the last term in ( [ eq : h_start ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bare bandwidth of the planar states is @xmath185ev@xmath186ev .",
    "therefore , the @xmath187 ratio is in the interval @xmath188 , which is not in the asymptotic limit of being @xmath189 .",
    "hence , one may expect that the double occupancy probability is not exactly vanishing , particularly for @xmath156 as then the admixture of double occupancy to the single - particle state is of the order@xcite of @xmath190 . in our calculations ( cf .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) @xmath191 for @xmath161 and @xmath192",
    ". such a small value does not influence at all the spin magnitude in the mott insulating state , since then @xmath193@xcite and the zero - point spin fluctuations are much more important .    after mentioning the relevance of the hubbard term , the basic question still remains as to what is the dominant contribution to @xmath1 . as said earlier , this is due to the superexchange@xcite via @xmath11 orbitals with inclusion of the fact that hts are charge transfer insulators with the corresponding gap @xmath194ev and the @xmath195 hybridization magnitude @xmath196ev , as well as the @xmath195 coulomb interaction @xmath197 ev . in effect , the nearest neighbors superexchange can be estimated as@xcite @xmath198 a value close to that determined experimentally@xcite .",
    "this reasoning provides a direct support for the effective value of @xmath1 as not coming from the large-@xmath2 expansion of the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "one should note that the mechanism introduces also the kondo - type coupling between the @xmath11 holes and @xmath10 electrons with the corresponding kondo exchange integral @xmath199 this coupling causes a bound configuration of the hole and @xmath10-electron of cu@xmath200 ion composing the zhang - rice singlet@xcite .",
    "also , the hopping amplitude for @xmath10 electron between the nearest neighboring sites @xmath201 can be estimated as @xmath202 taking @xmath203ev and @xmath204ev , we obtain @xmath205ev , also a quite reasonable value . in effect",
    ", we have @xmath206 which is a reasonable ratio in view of simplicity of our estimates . in such a reduction procedure to the one - band model",
    "the effective hubbard interaction is @xmath207ev , if we take the value @xmath208ev for the original @xmath10 atomic states . in the fitting to experiment we have obtained a slightly larger value of @xmath209ev and @xmath210ev .",
    "this brief discussion summarizes the meaning of the starting hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_start])@xcite .",
    "the general 3-band model would include a direct single - particle hopping between the oxygen sites @xmath211 . under these circumstances ,",
    "the kondo - type coupling ( [ eq : kondo ] ) between the oxygen and copper sites must be also taken into account explicitly and we end up in the emery - reiter type of model@xcite in the limit of localized @xmath8 electrons . in this respect , we have selected here the most general one - band model of correlated @xmath10 electrons with the zhang - rice singlet idea implicitly assumed .",
