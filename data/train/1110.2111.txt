    "in the present era of `` precision cosmology '' and rapidly advancing observational capabilities it is important to make precise theoretical predictions for future observations . among the major goals of observational cosmology in the near future",
    "are to collect data on structure at high redshifts ( including the first galaxies ) , detect the 21-cm line of intergalactic hydrogen , and study the cosmic reionization history .",
    "a deep understanding of structure formation on small scales and at high redshifts is crucial for making reliable predictions that will help us explore this observational frontier .    the linear perturbation theory of structure formation in the framework of the flat @xmath7cdm model is well understood .",
    "it allows us to follow the evolution of structure starting from tiny perturbations .",
    "the large - scale perturbations are @xmath8 of the background quantities at cosmic recombination , @xmath9 @xcite , and may have been produced during an early period of inflation .",
    "structure on the smaller scales on which halos form evolves nonlinearly .",
    "in order to make reliable predictions , it is important to verify when we can trust the results of the linear perturbation theory and on which scales the nonlinear effects must be accounted for .",
    "linear theory separates different scales , so that each density perturbation mode at a given wavenumber @xmath10 evolves independently .",
    "thus , nonlinear terms that couple the large - scale velocity to the small - scale density perturbations are neglected in linear perturbation theory .",
    "however , recently it was shown @xcite that such terms might be of the same order of magnitude as the linear terms exactly at the time and on the scales on which the first baryonic objects formed .",
    "specifically , the photon - baryon coupling before recombination left the dark matter and baryonic fluids with large relative velocities .",
    "these velocities impede the gravitational perturbation growth on small scales , leading to a spatially - variable suppression in the abundance of halos @xcite .",
    "moreover , halos that later form can not accrete the gas as it shoots past the collapsing dark matter @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the impact of the relative velocities on the distribution of the star - forming halos at high redshift and on the redshift of formation of the very first star .",
    "in particular , we include an aspect of the relative velocity effect that has not been previously accounted for , and which is critical for understanding the overall impact of the velocities on the distribution of star formation .",
    "recent small - scale numerical simulations @xcite found that the relative velocity substantially increases the minimum halo mass in which stars can form from gas that cools via molecular hydrogen cooling ( the effect of the velocities has also been simulated by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we briefly review the results of @xcite and @xcite . in section  3",
    "we summarize the results of recent simulations that include the nonlinear effect of the relative velocity on the formation of the first stars via molecular cooling .",
    "we use the simulation results to find the behavior of the minimal cooling mass versus redshift and magnitude of the relative velocity . in section  4",
    "we study in detail the probability distribution of the gas fraction in halos at high redshift , separating out and comparing the importance of the various effects of the bulk velocity . in section  5",
    "we then estimate the redshift of the very first star accounting for the relative velocity effect .",
    "finally , in section  6 we summarize our results and also give a complete list of differences compared to three previous papers : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our calculations are carried out in a flat @xmath7cdm universe with cosmological parameters taken from the 7-year wmap results ( wmap7+bao+@xmath11 maximum likelihood fit from @xcite ) : the dark matter density today @xmath12 , the baryon density @xmath13 , the vacuum energy density @xmath14 , the hubble constant @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , and the spectral index @xmath17 .",
    "we normalize the power spectrum to give a present value of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we use the camb - sources linear perturbation code @xcite to generate initial conditions at recombination ( specifically , at @xmath19 and @xmath20 in order to obtain the needed derivatives ) .",
    "in this section we briefly review the non - linear effect of the relative velocities between the baryons and dark matter , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the latter of which we closely follow in our subsequent calculations .",
    "the initial conditions at recombination include significant relative velocities between the baryons and the cold dark matter ( which we denote @xmath21 ) .",
    "before the baryons kinematically decouple from the radiation ( around @xmath22 ) , they are carried along with the photons , while the dark matter moves according to the gravitational growth of fluctuations which has been advancing since matter - radiation equality ( @xmath23 ) . at decoupling ,",
    "the baryonic speed of sound drops precipitously , and the relative velocity then becomes a substantial effect .    in the standard picture of gaussian initial conditions ( e.g. , from a period of inflation ) ,",
    "the density and the components of relative velocity are gaussian random variables .",
    "the velocity and density are spatially correlated ( at different points ) since the continuity equation relates the velocity divergence to the density .",
    "indeed , this equation gives an extra factor of @xmath24 in the velocity ( where @xmath10 is the wavenumber ) , making the velocity field coherent on larger scales than the density .",
    "specifically , velocity fluctuations have significant power over the range @xmath25 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the relative velocity is thus coherent on scales smaller than @xmath26 comoving mpc .",
    "we therefore analyze probability distributions in such coherent patches , and refer to the uniform relative velocity within each patch as the `` bulk '' or `` streaming '' velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the bulk velocity in each coherence patch at recombination is distributed according to a maxwell - boltzmann distribution function : [ mbdist]p_v(v ) = ( ) ^3/24v^2 ( - )  , where @xmath27 km sec@xmath16 is the root - mean - square velocity at recombination .",
    "just like any peculiar velocity , the bulk velocity @xmath21 decays as @xmath28 with the expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition to the bulk velocity , within each patch there are small - scale peculiar velocities of the baryons and dark matter related to the evolution of perturbations ( and formation of halos ) within the patch .",
    "as was shown in the above references , inside each coherent region the linear evolution equations for density and velocity perturbations are modified .",
    "for example , on small scales the nonlinear term in the continuity equation that couples the local density to the velocity field , @xmath29 , is comparable to linear terms such as the velocity term @xmath30 .",
    "the leading contribution of the nonlinear term comes from the bulk motion ( @xmath31 ) and this contribution is then linear in terms of the perturbations within the patch . as a result ,",
    "the evolution equations for the perturbations inside a coherent patch are still linear but dependent on the bulk @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting velocity - dependent terms were previously neglected but must be included when structure on small scales and at high redshifts is considered .",
    "the relative velocity effect is particularly important for the formation of the first stars and galaxies .",
    "as the first baryonic objects try to form , they must do so in a moving background of the dark matter potential wells .",
    "this relative motion means that the dark matter s gravity must work harder in order to trap the baryons . as a result",
    ", the formation of the first bounded baryonic objects is delayed .",
    "the effect , though , is less relevant for structure formation today , since the relative velocity decays with time while the typical mass of galactic host halos increases .",
    "however , the relative motion may shift slightly the positions of the bao peaks and produce a unique signature in the bispectrum of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the formation of the first baryonic objects ( in particular the first stars ) was an important milestone in the history of the universe .",
    "it marked the transition between the cold , neutral , metal - free universe ( the epoch called the `` dark '' cosmological ages that started right after recombination ) and the modern ionized , hot , and metal - rich universe .",
    "the formation of the very first stars is expected to be relatively simple ; this is due to the primordial chemistry before stars produced heavy elements , and the simplified gas dynamics in the absence of dynamically - relevant magnetic fields and feedback from luminous objects @xcite .    since molecular hydrogen line emission is the lowest - temperature coolant in metal - free gas , the first stars are expected to have formed in halos with total mass above @xmath32 m@xmath33 @xcite . more generally , if the mass of a dark matter halo is higher than a threshold referred to as the minimum cooling mass ( @xmath34 ) , the collapsing gas is heated to a high enough temperature that it emits radiation",
    ". it then cools and condenses , allowing a star to form .",
    "the threshold can also be described as a minimum circular velocity ( @xmath35 ) via the standard relation @xmath36 for a halo of mass @xmath37 and virial radius @xmath38 .",
    "this scenario of the earliest star formation has been confirmed by numerical simulations using both adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these simulations did not account for the initial relative velocities between the baryons and the dark matter .",
    "we now summarize two recent sph simulations @xcite that studied the impact of the relative streaming velocity @xmath21 on the formation of the first stars .",
    "numerical simulations face a great difficulty at high redshift , since they must resolve the then - typical tiny galaxies while at the same time capture the global galaxy distribution which is characterized by strong fluctuations on surprisingly large scales @xcite .",
    "the relative velocities are correlated up to scales above 100  mpc , and they are important at high redshifts where star formation is dominated by very small halos .",
    "cosmological simulations that cover this range of scales are not currently feasible .    however , numerical simulations are the best tool for studying the complex , non - linear formation of halos on small scales .",
    "the scales relevant to the formation of the small halos that host the first stars are well below the coherence scale of the relative velocity field .",
    "therefore it is possible to simulate halo formation in small patches of uniform @xmath21 .",
    "the simulations yield the mass reached by a halo when it first allows a star to form , i.e. , when it first contains a cooling , rapidly - collapsing gas core .",
    "the results show a substantially increased halo mass in regions with a significant relative velocity .",
    "this is a different effect from the suppression of the amount of gas , which implies a smaller number of stars in the halo at a given time ; instead in this case there is a substantial delay in the formation of the first star within the halo .",
    "moreover , this effect is not simply related to the total amount of accreted gas , since in the cases with a bulk velocity , even if we wait for the halo to accrete the same total gas mass as its no - velocity counterpart , it still does not form a star ( even within the now deeper potential of a more massive host halo ) ; the delay is substantially longer than would be expected based on a fixed total mass of accreted gas .",
    "instead , it appears that the explanation lies with the internal density and temperature profiles of the gas , which are strongly affected by the presence of the streaming motion .",
    "a plausible explanation for the resulting delay in star formation is that the first star forms from the gas that would have accreted early and formed the dense central cores in which stars form ; this gas tries to accrete early ( when @xmath21 is still very large ) into a still - small halo progenitor , so it is affected most strongly by the suppression of gas accretion due to the bulk velocity .",
    "the simulations yield a minimum halo cooling mass at various redshifts , so we fit the results to find the dependence of the minimum halo mass on the redshift of collapse and on the bulk velocity , @xmath21 , in the patch .",
    "this will then allow us to study the effect of the relative velocity on the formation of the first stars using statistical methods that average over large cosmological regions that can not be directly simulated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite state apparently contradictory conclusions , one claiming a negligible effect on star - forming halos and the other a large effect . in order to meaningfully compare their results , it is important to put them both on the same scale .",
    "we express the cooling threshold as a halo circular velocity , since simulations ( cited above ) without the bulk velocity find an approximately redshift - independent threshold @xmath39 ; this is naturally expected since molecular cooling turns on essentially at a fixed gas temperature , and the halo circular velocity determines the virial temperature to which the gas is heated .",
    "thus , the limit of zero bulk velocity simply gives a fixed threshold @xmath39 .",
    "when we add the relative velocities , in principle the minimum circular velocity in a patch may be a separate function of two parameters , the redshift @xmath40 and the bulk velocity at halo formation @xmath41 .",
    "the history of @xmath21 at earlier redshifts can not introduce additional parameters , since given both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the full history of @xmath21 is determined , i.e. , at any other redshift @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "consider now the limit of a very high bulk velocity , @xmath44 , so that the effect of @xmath39 is negligible . for simplicity , consider for a moment a constant @xmath21 versus redshift , fixed at its final value @xmath41 at the halo formation redshift @xmath40 . in this case",
    "there is only one velocity scale in the problem . as in a jeans mass analysis , in the reference frame of a collapsing dark matter halo with a circular velocity @xmath45 ,",
    "clearly gravity will be able to pull in the gas ( which streams by at the velocity @xmath41 ) if @xmath46 .",
    "now , in the real case where @xmath47 is higher during the formation of the halo , we would expect to get a threshold that is higher than @xmath41 , but by a fixed factor , because the physics is scale - free : on one side , @xmath21 scales in a simple way with redshift , and on the other side , halo formation ( in the high - redshift , einstein de - sitter universe ) also scales in a simple way , as we know from spherical collapse ; e.g. , turnaround for a halo that forms at redshift @xmath40 always occurs at @xmath42 where @xmath48 so that @xmath49 . the only new scale that enters is from @xmath21 at recombination , but as long as we consider halos that form long after recombination , this should be insignificant .    thus , the threshold circular velocity @xmath35 should change continuously between two limits , @xmath50 when @xmath51 , and @xmath52 when @xmath53 ( in terms of a fixed , dimensionless parameter @xmath54 ) . when @xmath35 is expressed as a function of @xmath41 , there is no additional dependence on @xmath40 in these two limits , so we might naturally expect this to be true in the intermediate region as well .",
    "indeed , the above argument suggests more generally that halo formation and @xmath41 scale together so that the effect of the bulk velocity should not depend separately on redshift ; also the effect of molecular cooling is a redshift - independent threshold .",
    "thus , when both effects act together , the result should still depend on just one parameter .",
    "we expect the dependence on velocity to be smooth and well - behaved for vector @xmath55 near zero , i.e. , as a function of the velocity components .",
    "this suggests a quadratic dependence on @xmath56 ^ 2 = \\left [ { { \\bf v}}\\bc(z ) \\right]^2 $ ] rather than , e.g. , a linear dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "we thus propose a simple ansatz for the minimum cooling threshold of halos that form at redshift @xmath40 : @xmath57 ^ 2 \\right\\}^{1/2}\\ .\\ ] ] the dependence of the circular velocity @xmath35 on redshift only through the final value @xmath41 implies that the star - formation threshold in a patch with a statistically rare , high value of @xmath21 at low redshift is the same as the threshold in a patch with the same ( but now statistically more typical ) value of @xmath21 at high redshift",
    ". this should be the case during the era of primordial star formation , before metal enrichment and other feedbacks complicate matters .",

    "thus , we combine this value of @xmath70 with @xmath54 from our optimal fit to obtain what we refer to as a `` fit '' to amr simulations . in other words , we assume that the discrepancy between the two simulation methods is only in the cooling process ( due to systematic entropy differences in dense cores ) , but that they would agree on the effect of the bulk motion .",

    "in a patch with no relative motion , the mass drops rapidly with redshift , since at higher redshift the gas density is higher and a given halo mass heats the infalling gas to a higher virial temperature .",
    "however , in a region at the root - mean - square value of @xmath21 decays as @xmath71 throughout the universe , a patch that has the root - mean - square value of @xmath21 at one redshift will have the root - mean - square value of the relative velocity at every redshift , and in particular @xmath72 km sec@xmath16 at recombination .",
    "] the higher bulk velocity at high redshift implies that a higher halo mass is needed for efficient molecular cooling . in particular ,",

    "we expect stars to form earlier , since the halos with lower masses are more abundant and form earlier in the hierarchical picture of structure formation .",
    "this is the basis of the discussion that follows .",
    "the population of gas - filled halos at high redshift divides naturally into two major categories .",
    "the first category consists of large halos in which the gas can cool ( via molecular hydrogen cooling ) ; these are presumed to be the sites of formation of the first stars , and are obviously most important since the stellar radiation is in principle observable , and it also produces feedback on the intergalactic medium and on other nearby sites of star formation . also interesting , though , is the second category , namely the smaller halos ( `` minihalos '' ) in which the gas accumulates to roughly virial density and yet can not cool .",

    "* ) .    in this subsection",
    "we apply the result we found for the minimum cooling mass to find the redshift evolution of the gas fraction in these two categories . in the following subsections",
    "we explore the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the gas fraction , beginning with its dependence on the bulk velocity .",
    "in addition , though , in each patch of coherent velocity the mean density is slightly different , varying as a result of random density fluctuations on scales larger than the patch size .",
    "we thus also study the full pdf as determined by the joint dependence of the gas fraction in halos on the bulk velocity and the local overdensity in each patch .",
    "following @xcite we find the fraction of the baryon density contained in halos with mass larger than the minimum cooling mass @xmath34 f(>m)=_m^ dm  , where @xmath81 is the mean matter density today , @xmath82 is the comoving abundance of halos of mass @xmath37 , @xmath83 is the mean cosmic baryon fraction and @xmath84 is the fraction of the total halo mass which is in the form of gas .",
    "the gas fractions @xmath84 depend on the filtering mass , which measures the scale at which the baryon fluctuations differ substantially from those in the dark matter . in each patch , the filtering mass depends on the bulk velocity , and thus so do the gas fractions .",
    "since the baryons contribute to the total power spectrum , the halo abundance @xmath82 ( which depends on fluctuations in the total matter density ) varies as well with @xmath21 .",
    "we use the halo mass function of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the full details .",
    "we begin by recalculating some of the results of @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : vc2 ] the redshift evolution of the globally averaged gas fraction in star - forming halos or in gas minihalos . compared with figure  8 of @xcite ,",
    "our gas fractions are substantially lower , e.g. , the gas fraction in halos above the minimum cooling mass is lower by a factor of @xmath26 at redshift @xmath65 .",
    "this is due to our higher @xmath34 and lower power spectrum normalization ( see section  6 for a full discussion of our differences with previous papers ) .",
    "note that the gas fraction in halos above the minimum cooling mass is proportional to the stellar mass density , assuming a fixed star formation efficiency ( averaged over each 3  mpc patch ) .     the global mean gas fraction in star - forming halos ( solid curves ) and in minihalos , i.e. , halos below the cooling threshold ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the results , based on our optimal fit ( eq .  [ eq : opt ] ) are shown after averaging over the distribution of relative velocity ( thick curves ) , or in the case of no relative motion , i.e. , for @xmath58 ( thin curves).,width=326 ]    in general , the importance of the relative velocities increases with redshift . comparing the two categories of halos , we find that the relative suppression of the minihalos is larger than that of the star - forming halos at low redshift ; however , the relative suppression of the star - forming halos increases faster with redshift , and eventually it becomes larger than that of the minihalos ( beyond @xmath85 ) . at @xmath2 , the bulk velocities reduce the mean gas fraction in star - forming halos by a factor of 1.8 and that in minihalos by 3.1 .    unlike previous studies , in our calculations the relative velocities produce three separate effects : suppression of the halo abundance ( @xmath82 ) , suppression of the gas content within each halo ( @xmath86 ) , and boosting of the minimum cooling mass ( through @xmath87 ) . in order to gain a better physical understanding , and for easier comparison with previous papers , we investigate the relative importance of each effect in figure  [ fig : vc2rat ] .",
    "for the star - forming halos , the suppression of gas content is always the least significant effect ( e.g. , suppression by a factor of 1.13 on its own at @xmath2 ) , while the cooling mass boost is most important above @xmath88 ( factor of 1.26 on its own at @xmath2 ) , and the halo abundance cut is most important at lower redshifts ( factor of 1.43 on its own at @xmath2 ) . for the minihalos , the boosting of the minimum cooling mass acts as a ( small ) positive effect , since it moves gas from the star - forming to the minihalo category ( e.g. , boost by a factor of 1.10 on its own at @xmath2 ) ,",
    "while the other two effects are larger and comparable ( e.g. , at @xmath2 the suppression of gas content would give a reduction by a factor of 2.17 on its own , and the halo abundance cut would give a suppression factor of 1.74 ) .",

    "however , in reality the universe is highly inhomogeneous on small cosmological scales .",
    "we can divide it into patches that have various bulk velocities and densities . in this section",
    "we consider just the variation with velocity , i.e. , averaged over all density fluctuations . in other words , we look at the contribution of velocity fluctuations to fluctuations in the gas fraction in halos . if we consider patches that are still small enough to have a coherent @xmath21 ( e.g. , cubes of 3 comoving mpc on a side ) , then the absolute value of the bulk velocity in each one follows a maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( eq .  [ mbdist ] ) .",
    "consider the contributions of patches of various velocities to the total amount of star formation . at a given redshift",
    ", the gas fraction in star - forming halos is lower in the patches with a high value of the relative velocity , because all three velocity effects ( see the previous subsection ) tend to reduce this gas fraction . on the other hand , patches with zero bulk velocity",
    "do not contribute much , simply because they are rare .",
    "as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : vcpdf ] , the most common bulk velocity is @xmath89 , where @xmath21 and @xmath90 are both measured at the same redshift ( recombination or any other @xmath40 ) .",
    "if the stellar density were independent of the bulk velocity , then the contribution of regions of various velocities would be proportional to the velocity pdf .",

    "the global star formation is highest in the rare regions with both low bulk velocity and high overdensity , but more generally , one of these can compensate for the other .",
    "the effect of @xmath21 on star - forming halos vanishes by @xmath110 , in agreement with our previous results , leaving just the effect of the local density . even at somewhat higher redshifts ( up to @xmath111 ) , the concentrating effect of the velocities on their own ( figure  [ fig : vcpdf2 ] ) remains weaker than that of the densities alone ( no - velocity case in figure  [ fig : fpdf ] ) , so at these redshifts the full case is dominated by the densities , and the concentrating effect of density is enhanced by including the velocities ( which steepen the dependence on density : figure  [ fig : vcdelta ] ) . at redshifts above @xmath112 , velocities dominate , and then including the density fluctuations ( compared to averaging over them at each velocity ) actually reduces the concentration since it allows low - velocity regions to contribute relatively more volume with high gas fractions ( due to the steeper density dependence at high bulk velocity ) .",
    "specifically , at @xmath2 , density fluctuations alone ( i.e. , setting @xmath113 ) would concentrate @xmath0 of the stars into @xmath114 of the volume and @xmath98 into @xmath115 of the volume .",
    "the addition of the bulk velocity provides a mildly increased concentration into @xmath1 and @xmath116 of the volume , respectively . at redshift 60",

    "the effect of the velocities should be more clearly apparent on scales larger than our 3  mpc pixels , i.e. , in addition to the small additional concentration that they cause ( as seen in figure  [ fig : fpdf ] ) , their effect is to redistribute the star - forming regions to produce larger coherent regions of either high star formation or low star formation ( voids ) .",
    "we note that the assumption that the local overdensity on large scales @xmath103 and the streaming velocity @xmath21 are statistically independent is not perfectly accurate . a patch with a high local overdensity has expanded less than other patches , so that the peculiar velocity @xmath21 has not declined as much compared to the expansion .",
    "indeed , we expect that @xmath121 .",
    "however , we have found that this correction makes only a small difference to the pdf ( up to a @xmath122 relative error at @xmath123 , and less at lower redshifts ) .",
    "in the previous sections we have discussed the conditions needed to initiate star formation .",
    "the main condition is that the halo mass must be large enough to allow molecular cooling . given a large enough initial density fluctuation , a halo with a sufficiently large mass will form relatively early .",
    "the very first stars depend on extremely rare fluctuations , hence we need to average over the volume of the observable universe , @xmath124 , in order to have the full statistical range needed to accurately estimate the formation time of the first star .    due to computational limitations , numerical simulations can form stars only in a very limited cosmological context .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied star formation in a @xmath125 volume and @xcite were limited to @xmath126 . in a small volume the chance of getting a rare high density fluctuation is quite small .",
    "therefore the formation redshift of the first stars in simulations is greatly underestimated , with most simulations forming their first star below redshift 30 .",
    "the highest redshift where a star has formed in a simulation is @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "@xcite first applied these statistical considerations in order to predict the redshift of the first observable star ( i.e. , in our past light cone ) analytically .",
    "they estimated the redshift of the first star to be @xmath128 , using the 3-year wmap set of cosmological parameters @xcite and assuming a minimum circular velocity for cooling of @xmath129 km sec@xmath16 . in this section",
    "we generalize their method in order to account for the bulk velocities and estimate their impact on the epoch of the first star formation .",
    "this problem is particularly relevant since the effect of the relative velocity on star formation increases with redshift , and is thus at its maximum when we consider the very first star .",
    "we also study the sensitivity of the first - star redshift to various uncertainties .",
    "following @xcite we calculate the mean expected number @xmath130 of star - forming halos that formed at redshift @xmath40 or higher , but where the halo abundance is now averaged over the bulk velocity distribution at each redshift .",
    "this number is the ensemble - averaged number of stars , but we have only one universe to observe .",
    "hence , we expect poisson fluctuations in the actual observed numbers .",

    "the difference with @xcite is due to the changes in the cosmological parameters between wmap3 and wmap7 , specifically the increased power on the relevant scales ( since the increased spectral index has a larger effect than the reduced @xmath138 ) , and the decreased cooling mass in the @xmath113 case compared to the value assumed by @xcite .     *",

    "regarding the cosmological parameters , the redshift of the first star is sensitive to the amount of power on the scale of the first halos .",
    "the uncertainly of wmap7 @xcite in the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations ( parameterized by @xmath138 ) is @xmath151 , which implies ( for our optimal fit ) an uncertainty of @xmath152 in the median redshift of the first star .",
    "the larger is @xmath138 , the earlier will the first star form .",
    "more generally , we include the current correlated errors in the full suite of standard cosmological parameters , and find a resulting @xmath153 .    in order to estimate the impact of the current uncertainty in the effect of the bulk velocity on the minimum cooling mass",
    ", we estimate the redshift of the first star for each of the fits discussed in section  3 . we find ( figure  [ fig : fstar ] , bottom panel ) that the range of the sph simulations is a @xmath154 , and the discrepancy between the amr and sph simulations is comparable .",
    "thus , we conclude that the delay due to the bulk motion is substantial , but there are still significant uncertainties in it . in summary , we find the median redshift of the first star in our observable universe to be z = 65.0^+1.5_-1.1 ( poisson ) ^+0.8_-1.5 ( simulations ) 5.1 ( cosmology )  .thus , current uncertainties in the values of the cosmological parameters dominate over the differences in the simulations and the irreducible poisson fluctuations .",
    "we have studied the impact of the relative motion between the gas and the dark matter on the formation of the first stars .",
    "we included a new effect found in recent small - scale hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "in particular , we fit their results to a physically - motivated ansatz that expresses the minimum circular velocity of gas - cooling halos as a simple function of the local bulk velocity when the halo forms .",
    "this result implies that in contrast to previous expectations , the minimum mass of star - forming halos does not decrease with redshift , except in regions with very low values of the bulk velocity .",
    "this result implies that the relative velocities produce three separate effects : suppression of the halo abundance , suppression of the gas content within each halo , and boosting of the minimum halo mass required for cooling .",
    "quantitatively , we found that the halo abundance cut has a large effect on the two categories of halos ( star - forming halos and star - less minihalos ) , while the cooling mass boost primarily affects star - forming halos and the suppression of gas content primarily affects the minihalos . in total , at @xmath2 the bulk velocities reduce the mean gas fraction in star - forming halos by a factor of @xmath155 and that in minihalos by @xmath156 .",
    "thus , even at @xmath2 the velocity causes order unity fluctuations in the stellar density , and these fluctuations should be present at the large ( 100  mpc ) scales spanned by the velocity correlations .",
    "the velocity dependence of the gas fraction tends to concentrate the global star formation into regions of low bulk velocity . in particular , at @xmath2 , @xmath0 of the stars are in the @xmath99 of the volume with the lowest velocity , and @xmath98 are in @xmath100 of the volume . adding in the effect of density fluctuations tends to concentrate the global star formation into regions of both low bulk velocity and high overdensity . as a result , at @xmath2 , @xmath0 of the stars form within @xmath1 of the volume and @xmath98 in @xmath116 of the volume",
    "this concentration effect becomes much stronger at higher redshifts .",
    "the formation of the very first star is delayed by @xmath6 due to the bulk velocities . given the updated cosmological and astrophysical parameters , the first star is now most likely to form at @xmath146 , with a median @xmath147 ( corresponding to a cosmic age of @xmath148  myr ) . due to the combination of density and velocity fluctuations , the formation of stars begins at different times in different regions .",
    "this leads to a very inhomogeneous early universe .",
    "although by redshift 20 most of the universe is populated , the age of the oldest stars in each region is significantly different .    to make the novelty of our work clear",
    ", we now make a full comparison of the ingredients of our calculations with those in the previous literature .",
    "we start with @xcite , who discovered that the relative velocity effect is important .",
    "they only calculated the impact on the halo abundance , but this was sufficient for them to deduce the implication of large - scale fluctuations .",
    "however , their calculations had a number of simplifying assumptions : they calculated the baryon perturbations under the approximation of a uniform sound speed , and used the old press - schechter halo mass function .",
    "@xcite were the first to point out the effect of the relative velocity on suppressing the gas content of halos .",
    "however , they made a number of simplifying approximations that we have relaxed here .",
    "these include :    \\(i ) we have calculated the filtering mass ( @xmath157 ) from linear theory , while they took the effective value found in simulations in the standard ( no relative velocity ) case , and then multiplied it by a simple @xmath21-dependent ansatz .",
    "\\(ii ) we have allowed for a smooth transition between gas - rich halos at @xmath158 and gas - poor halos at @xmath159 as is suggested by simulations , rather than applying a step - function cutoff .",
    "\\(iii ) we have simultaneously included the dependence of the gas fraction in halos on the large - scale matter overdensity @xmath103 and relative velocity @xmath21 .",
    "this combines both the `` traditional '' biasing model ( which includes @xmath103 but not @xmath21 ) and the @xcite treatment ( which includes @xmath21 but not @xmath103 ) .",
    "we found that both effects are important ( compare sections  4.2 and 4.3 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) we included the effect of @xmath21 on the halo mass function @xcite , which @xcite did not .",
    "\\(v ) most importantly , we incorporated a cooling criterion for star formation , rather than scaling by the total gas content in halos .",
    "the vast majority of the gas is in minihalos that can not cool , and because of their low circular velocities their ability to collect baryons is much more affected by @xmath21 than the star - forming halos .",
    "this suggests that the effect of relative velocities on early star formation might be less than found by @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the inclusion of the other effects ( mass function and cooling threshold , in addition to baryon fraction ) does restore the expectation for order unity fluctuations , with exciting implications for observational 21-cm cosmology .",
    "in part of this paper we closely followed @xcite .",
    "however , we fixed two inaccuracies in their power spectrum ( in the normalization and the spectral slope ) that gave substantially too much power on small scales .",
    "then , our main goals were to include the new effect on the cooling mass based on simulations , to extend the calculations to the highest redshifts of star formation , and to quantify the degree of concentration of star - forming halos . with there now being three separate effects of the bulk velocity , we also carefully studied the relative importance of these various effects .",
