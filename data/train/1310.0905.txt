    "recently high research intensities have emerged from the field known as relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "one of the typical examples to study relativistic effects on quantum information is the spin of a massive dirac particle ( e.g. , electron ) .",
    "spin and momentum degrees of freedom of a massive dirac particle are entangled in general . moreover",
    ", a lorentz transformation can change the entanglement between them .",
    "this fact has created a controversy in understanding the spin under a lorentz transformation .",
    "the problem of defining reduced spin density matrix for a massive dirac particle , which encodes the quantum information of the spin , by integrating out the momentum degree of freedom is still controversial @xcite .    at this stage",
    "we need a clear understanding of the spin operator itself in an arbitrary reference frame .",
    "even though the reduced spin density matrix must be a superposition of eigenstates of the spin operator , tracing over the momentum degree of freedom , which is entangled with the spin degree of freedom , makes the clear understanding of the spin itself difficult .",
    "therefore , mathematical formalisms related with the reduced density matrix are not enough to clarify the controversial arguments in previous works . to understand the spin operator physically , the investigation of the spin measurement is most desirable . the best candidate is the famous stern - gerlach ( sg ) experiment , in which a spin interacts with electromagnetic fields .",
    "in the original sg experiment , the interaction is considered as non - relativistic .",
    "special relativity requires that every observer must observe the same experimental result , which is the clicking event of the detector .",
    "we call this requirement a ( relativistic ) covariance of the sg experiment",
    ".    recently saldanha et al . presented an interesting new treatment for the spin of a massive relativistic particle in the covariant generalization of the stern - gerlach ( sg ) experiment @xcite .",
    "they have tried to detour the problem of defining the spin in an arbitrary reference frame by using the covariance of the sg hamiltonian .",
    "the discussion of the sg experiment in the particle rest frame seems to be clear , because the spin operator in the particle rest frame is well - known as the usual pauli spin operator .",
    "the covariance of the spin dipole interaction in the sg experiment , however , inevitably requires the discussion of the relativistic spin in an arbitrary frame .",
    "usually , the spin has been considered as a relativistic object because the two - dimensional spinor representation is an irreducible representation of the lorentz group . also , a spin is the second casimir of the inhomogeneous lorentz ( poincar@xmath0 ) group so that the unitary representation of the spin for the poincar@xmath0 group is the wigner s little group .",
    "hence the relativistically covariant generalization of the sg hamiltonian is expected to give the proper definition of the spin operator in an arbitrary frame .",
    "the manifestly covariant form of dipole interactions can be obtained by the dipole tensor defined in the classical electrodynamics @xcite . by using the lorentz transformation of the magnetic dipole moment",
    "one can obtain the spin in an arbitrary frame .",
    "we will call this spin the relativistic spin .",
    "the definition of the relativistic spin in an arbitrary frame can be extracted from the spin magnetic dipole moment in that frame through the relation between a spin magnetic dipole moment and a spin for a free relativistic particle @xcite .",
    "the critical issue , however , is that the origin of the spin for a massive dirac particle is not only relativistic but also quantum mechanical . as is well - known , the spin index of a massive dirac particle is naturally introduced by the dirac theory that has successfully reconciled quantum theory with special relativity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the proper spin operator for a massive dirac particle must be defined by using the dirac theory . in the dirac theory",
    ", the spinor representation is not 2-dimensional but 4-dimensional .",
    "this means that the dirac spinor is not an irreducible representation of the lorentz group itself , but an irreducible representation of the lorentz group extended by parity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the symmetry group for a massive dirac particle is not just the poincar@xmath0 group but must be extended by parity .",
    "this means that the spin operator for a massive dirac particle in an arbitrary frame must be obtained in the 4-dimensional dirac spinor representation .",
    "we will call this spin operator the dirac spin operator to distinguish from the relativistic spin operator",
    ".    we will show in this paper that the relativistic spin obtained by the classical dipole tensor can not be a spin operator because the relativistic spin three - vector operators do not satisfy the spin algebra .",
    "furthermore , the covariance of the sg experiment provides a paradox for the relativistic spin among observers in different motions . to resolve the paradox it is essential to use the dirac spin operator . the dirac spin operator will be shown to have additional pure quantum mechanical terms to the relativistic spin operator .",
    "these pure quantum mechanical terms are critical to satisfy the spin algebra and to interpret the sg experiment covariantly and consistently .",
    "in this section we will study the relativistic spin and the dirac spin .",
    "the spin tensors for both spins are well - defined on minkowski space - time",
    ". the relativistic spin tensor in an arbitrary frame will be obtained by the relativistic generalization of spin dipole interactions in classical electrodynamics . on the other hand",
    ", the dirac spin tensor in an arbitrary frame will be obtained by a lorentz transformation in the dirac spinor representation from the spin tensor in the particle rest frame .",
    "the hamiltonian of the original sg experiment is given by non - relativistic classical magnetic dipole interaction . in this sense",
    "we will call the relativistic generalization of the non - relativistic sg interaction , classical .",
    "a covariance of the sg experiment is required by special relativity , because all observers in their own inertial frames must observe the same events for the detectors of the sg devices . in relativistic case",
    "we must consider both electric and magnetic interactions with spin dipole moments , because a magnetic field in one reference frame would transform to electric and magnetic fields in another reference frame .",

    "it is enough to consider the pure boost since the rotation is trivial for the spin .",

    "then only a spin magnetic dipole interaction occurs in the particle rest frame .",
    "now we will define the relativistic spin in an arbitrary frame by using the relation between the spin and the spin magnetic dipole moment for a massive relativistic particle @xcite .",

    "<S> we have studied a relativistically covariant stern - gerlach ( sg ) experiment for a relativistic spin and a dirac spin . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the relativistic spin in an arbitrary frame by using the classical spin dipole tensor , which gives the covariant spin dipole interactions , and the relation between a spin and a spin magnetic dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic spin is shown to have problems to become a proper spin operator for a massive relativistic particle because of two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the relativistic spin three - vector operators can not satisfy the spin algebra . </S>",
    "<S> second , the sg experiment for the relativistic particle provides a paradox between two observers in the particle rest frame and the laboratory frame , in which the particle is moving . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the paradox in the sg experiment is resolved by the dirac spin , which is covariantly defined by a lorentz transformation in the dirac spinor representation . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac spin three - vector operators satisfy the spin algebra . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the sg experiment for the dirac spin in the inertial frame , where there is only magnetic field , can determine the spin without the information of the momentum of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the reduced spin density matrix for the dirac particle can be well - defined by integrating out the momentum degrees of freedom . </S>"
