    "science , graphs represent dependencies among streams of data generated by different sources or agents .",
    "such networks are frequently large , and it may be desirable to model them as random variables due to uncertainty or inherent stochastic influences in their structures . when studying the properties of the matrices that encode the graph structure of these networks , such as the graph adjacency matrix and the graph laplacian , spectral",

    "linear shift - invariant filtering as defined in graph signal processing represents an example application in which such eigenvalue information would be useful . in signal processing on graphs ,",
    "a matrix @xmath1 related to the graph structure , such as the graph adjacency matrix or graph laplacian , defines the shift operator @xcite@xcite .",
    "filters manifest as polynomial functions @xmath2 in the shift operator @xcite , and decomposition of a signal defined on the nodes according to a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath1 play the role of the fourier transform @xcite .",
    "because the eigenvalues of the row - normalized adjacency matrix and row - normalized laplacian matrix are closely related to a measure of signal complexity known as total variation , eigenvalues of the shift matrix can be interpreted as frequencies @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a diagonalizable matrix , then @xmath2 is simultaneously diagonalizable with @xmath1 , so the frequency response to an eigenvector @xmath3 where @xmath4 is @xmath5 @xcite@xcite .",
    "hence , information concerning the shift matrix eigenvalues is critical to filter design .",
    "for instance , knowledge of the eigenvalues can lead to polynomial filters that accelerate the distributed average consensus algorithm @xcite or , for large filter degrees and completely known eigenvalues , can even lead to polynomial filters that achieve consensus in finite time @xcite .",
    "this paper examines the adjacency matrix eigenvalues for a particular random network model as the size of the network grows through the asymptotic behavior of the empirical spectral distribution of the adjacency matrix , a function that counts the fraction of eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix on the interval @xmath6 $ ] @xcite@xcite .",

    "these lattice graphs , which have at most @xmath7 adjacency matrix eigenvalues , represent good candidates to examine because the number of expected adjacency matrix eigenvalues for the resulting percolation model depends only on the number of dimensions @xmath0 and not on the lattice size @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of empirical spectral distributions is sometimes characterizable , as in the well known case of wigner matrices with the semicircular law @xcite and , closely related , in erds - rnyi model adjacency matrices @xcite . for the matrices in this paper , sequences of deterministic functions that asymptotically approximate the empirical spectral distribution are computed using the stochastic canonical equations tools developed by girko , which allow analysis when symmetric matrix entries are independent , except when determined by symmetry , but not necessarily identically distributed @xcite .",
    "these tools were used by others to analyze the empirical spectral distribution of a different type of random network model known as stochastic block models in @xcite , that leads to a different system of equations and solution form when the analysis tools are applied .",
