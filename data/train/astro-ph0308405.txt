    "most of our knowledge of galaxy populations derives from samples collected in optical surveys , where there are strong selection effects .",
    "for instance most of the galaxies we know about are barely brighter than the terrestrial sky , while galaxies which have lower surface - brightnesses may be severely under - represented .",
    "attempts to overcome optical selection effects through the use of better detectors , larger telescopes , longer exposures and sophisticated image processing have met with partial success .",
    "this remains a very difficult process , however , and the subsequent corrections which have to be made to small number statistics are both large and controversial ( e.g.  impey & bothun 1997 , disney 1999 ) .    low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies could be significant in a number of contexts .",
    "they might add to or even dominate the luminosity - density and/or mass - density of galaxies as a whole ( e.g. fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "additionally , they could be responsible for much of the metal line absorption seen in qso spectra ( churchill & le brun 1998 ) , while their presence in large numbers could be important to theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "contemporary views as to the global significance of lsb galaxies are wide ranging , partly as a result of conflicting and usually indirect evidence , but mainly as a consequence of conflicting interpretation ( impey & bothun 1997 ; davies , impey , & phillipps 1999 ) .",
    "blind searches in the 21-cm neutral hydrogen line have long been considered an alternative to optical surveys for finding lsb disc galaxies ( disney 1976 ) .",
    "the narrowness of the line means that cosmic expansion will discriminate between extra - galactic and local hydrogen , so reducing the local background to the instrumental level beyond a redshift of a few hundred kms@xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , blind 21-cm surveys have until recently been severely limited by technical considerations , in particular by the tiny areas and small velocity ranges that could be covered to any depth in a practical time .",
    ".equivalent central surface - brightnesses",
    "( in _ b_-band ) for different column densities and different hi mass - to - light ratios ( calculated using the derivation in appendix [ disney - banks - deriv ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that if @xmath10 remains constant at the value for optically - selected galaxies of @xmath11 , it is necessary to go to very low column - densities to find lsb galaxies .",
    "however , if @xmath10 rises as the surface - brightness falls , it is possible to reach low surface - brightnesses without requiring low column - densities . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ mhi - nhi_tab ] demonstrates this for galaxies of different masses and column - densities .",
    "the @xmath12 @xmath3 galaxy is below the column - density limit and will never be detected in hideep .",
    "all the other galaxies are above the column - density limit and are therefore detected out to the distances set by their peak fluxes .",
    "the volume over which a galaxy above the column - density limit will be detected is determined solely by the peak flux of the galaxy .    in summary ,",
    "21-cm surveys have two constraints : ( a ) a peak - flux limit given by equation [ diseqn0 ] in which dish size ( @xmath13 ) is a distinct advantage , and ( b ) a surface - density limit where dish size is irrelevant , but in which integration time per beam is all - important . in a search for high surface - density @xmath9 objects ,",
    "short integration - times per beam are favoured ; in a search for low column - density ( and therefore low surface - brightness ) objects , long integrations are mandatory .",
    "( an alternative way of looking at this is to note that larger dishes project the same system noise on to smaller areas of sky , because their diffraction - limited beams are smaller , and so have to contend with higher apparent sky - noise ) .",
    "thus hideep and hipass are complementary : hipass with its relatively short integration - time per beam ( 450s ) picks up large numbers of high surface - density sources but is insensitive to objects below @xmath14 @xmath3 ( @xmath15 kms@xmath0 ) while hideep with its very long integration - time per beam ( 9000s ) is the first blind survey ( see table [ hitab ] ) capable of reaching much lower surface - density @xmath9 , and hence surface - brightness , limits    before the advent of the multibeam system at parkes it was neither profitable nor practical to make the very long integrations required to reach low column density .",
    "thus the limits quoted in such surveys for the total amount of cosmic hi referred only to high column - density clouds and galaxies , though this was rarely acknowledged .",
    "their integration times per beam were mostly far too short to detect the lower surface - density features .",
    "hideep ( see appendix [ col - density - sens ] ) should and indeed does reach    @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath3 for a typical galaxy with a velocity width of 200 kms@xmath0 .    in principle , therefore , we should be able to reach galaxies with lower surface - brightnesses than any detectable before either in hi or in the optical ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the hi survey is complemented by deep optical observations , reaching an isophotal level of 26.5 magarcsec@xmath5 in the _ r_-band , covering three - quarters of the survey region . for our analysis",
    ", we assume a value of @xmath18  kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 throughout .",
    "despite technical difficulties , blind surveys have been carried out , often using special techniques ( see table [ hitab ] for details ) .",
    "for instance shostak ( 1977 ) re - examined the signals in the ` off - beams ' of an nrao 300-foot survey , where the ` on - beams ' were pointed at bright , optically selected galaxies .",

    "that the left hand side of equation [ nhieqn2 ] is independent of dish size can be seen from the right hand side as both the minimum flux ( top ) and the beam size ( bottom ) are inversely proportional to the dish area .",
    "an examination of the various survey source - limits shows excellent agreement between the column density as calculated according to appendix [ col - density - calc ] and separately from applying equation [ nhieqn2 ] to the various source lists .",
    "for instance if we look at the deep drift - scan survey carried out by zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss ) , and examine those sources which lie within its main beam , we can use these to calculate the column - density limit of this survey for a typical velocity width of 200 kms@xmath0 .",
    "we find that this limit is :    @xmath34    i.e. @xmath35 ( ahiss ) @xmath36 @xmath3  almost precisely the minimum value found by the vla follow - up observations . in other words , the ahiss survey was a shallow survey capable only of picking up sources down to a few times @xmath37  @xmath3 with a velocity - width of @xmath38  kms@xmath0 . the ahiss results do not , therefore , rule out the presence of a population of low column - density galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the 5@xmath39 column - density sensitivity for ahiss given in table [ hitab ] is substantially lower than found in equation [ ahiss - sens ] .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the limit for ahiss is well above 5@xmath39 .",
    "the other recent deep arecibo survey , the arecibo slice ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ; spitzak & schneider 1998 ) operated rather differently .",
    "patches of sky about 2 beam diameters apart were followed for 60s , and any sources tentatively picked up were then re - scanned using a grid search . that meant that the sensitivity varied by a factor of @xmath40 over the total 55 square degrees searched .",
    "the median flux of the sources detected over the velocity range 100 to 8340  kms@xmath0 was 2.69  jykms@xmath0 as against the median value for hideep of 1.96  jykms@xmath0 .",
    "because of the short 60s integration time , the sensitivity to low - column - density sources was poorer than ahiss .",
    "nevertheless there were interesting results . only half the galaxies detected were in any optical catalogue and about a third were lsb galaxies",
    "the galaxies have much lower bulge - to - disc ratios than found in optically - selected samples .",
    "the median @xmath10 of the survey was @xmath41 and the galaxies with larger @xmath10 ratios had lower surface - brightnesses .",
    "henning s ( 1992 ; 1995 ) survey with the green bank 300-foot telescope was largely behind the galactic plane and therefore not comparable with hideep . the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs ; rosenberg & schneider 2000 ; 2002 ) covered a larger area of sky than the other surveys but to a much shallower depth , and so could not set any limits to the population of low - column - density galaxies .",
    "although blind 21-cm surveys are , in principle , the ideal way of circumventing optical selection effects and looking for lsb galaxies and igcs , the weakness of the 21-cm signal and the system noise make it very difficult to find sources unless they have high column - densities .",
    "only very long integrations are capable of reaching low column - density limits , and possibly finding objects of lower surface - brightness than can be seen optically  thus the interest of hideep .",
    "we claim that the arguments summarised in equation [ disney - banks ] and table [ nhi - sb_tab ] demonstrate that we should , for the first time at 21-cm , be capable of locating such objects .",
    "even so , the limitations of all such blind hi surveys should constantly be kept in mind .",
    "such surveys have lower sensitivity to broader - line sources ( see below ) and may , particularly at low column - densities ( @xmath42  @xmath3 ) , be severely affected by ionisation and spin temperature effects ( section [ col - densities ] ) .",
    "hi surveys , therefore , can set only lower limits to the number of lsb galaxies and igcs in the cosmos .",
    "hideep was carried out in a region of centaurus centred on @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( j2000 ) with 1024 spectral channels covering @xmath45 to 12,700 kms@xmath0 . due to the shape of the parkes multibeam footprint ,",
    "the survey has a sensitivity as good as or better than hipass over 6 by 10 degrees with a uniform sensitivity over the central 4 by 8 degree area .",
    "this region lies in the supergalactic plane , 30 degrees from the galactic plane .",
    "the hideep volume includes the cen a group ( banks et al .",
    "1999 ) and the outer parts of the centaurus cluster .",
    "the observations were carried out in the southern autumns of 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 .",
    "the data were processed using the standard multibeam reduction techniques , as described in detail by barnes et al .",
    "continuum sources were removed using luther ( wright & stewart 2003 , in preparation ) .",

    "we have smoothed the data with a hanning filter and removed every other channel from the smoothed cube in order to leave only the independent channels .",
    "this has been repeated to form cubes smoothed over 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 and 32 channels . for white noise ,",
    "the noise should fall as @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the number of channels smoothed over ) , however it can be seen that this is not the case for @xmath59 . beyond this",
    "the fall off is shallower than predicted by poisson statistics ",
    "closer to @xmath60 , although it is not well described by a power - law .",
    "the hideep cube was searched three times in an independent manner .",
    "two different people searched through the cube by eye , inspecting every channel and noting down the sources found , and the third search was carried out by an automated finding routine based on peak - flux detection and template fitting .",
    "this routine identified points higher than 4.5-@xmath39 on a hanning - smoothed cube and fitted gaussian templates with a large range of widths at these points , demanding a correlation of better than 0.75 .",
    "the three lists given by these searches were then compared and any sources found two or more times were accepted .",
    "the remaining disputed sources were examined by a third member of the team for a final decision .",
    "this team member had not previously searched the data cube .",
    "this gave us a final list of 173 sources , all of which have been judged as real by at least two members of the team acting independently .",
    "accurate positions for all the sources were found by forming zeroth - moment maps around their positions and velocities and fitting gaussians to these maps .",
    "this gives a positional accuracy , as judged from those sources that can be securely identified with optical galaxies , of around 2@xmath61 ( see figure [ offsetcomp ] ) .",
    "the hi parameters of the galaxies were measured using the mbspect routine in miriad which provides measures of the velocity width , the noise in the spectrum and the peak flux of the source as well as robust estimates of the integrated flux and systemic velocity .",

    "if the best - possible real - world selection was made , i.e. selection purely by signal - to - noise ratio using optimal smoothing in the velocity plane , then the selection limit would be a line with a slope of 0.5 on a log - log plot ( assuming @xmath62 , which is not strictly true as shown in figure [ smoothnoise ] ) , shown here as a dashed line .",
    "the solid line on the graph shows a selection limit based on peak flux ( @xmath63 ) ; only 16 of the 173 sources fall below this line and only 8 of these are below by more than 1-@xmath39 .",
    "sources appear to fall further below the line at the low - flux , low - velocity - width end , but this is probably due to the larger errors in this region .",
    "the peak - flux selection limit is shown in figure [ selectionlimits2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that this explains well the selection limit of the survey .",

    "sources have been identified with galaxies on the optical image , firstly on the basis of positional coincidences .",
    "multibeam survey positions are generally accurate to 2 arcminutes ( koribalski et al .",
    "2003 ) , but this can be checked for the 65 optical counterparts which have previously published optical velocities or for which we have our own optical spectroscopy or 21-cm interferometry data . a comparison can be made between the ( radio  optical ) offsets of these firm detections with the remainder ( figure [ offsetcomp ] ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms that there is no significant difference between the distributions , implying that the purely positional coincidences can generally be trusted .",
    "there may still be one or two incorrect identifications , but the tail of offsets out to 6.5 arcminutes probably reflects the positional accuracy of the hideep survey .        in the overlap area 59% of the sources",
    "are identified with previously catalogued galaxies with matching redshifts , 24% with previously catalogued galaxies without redshifts , and 17% are previously uncatalogued galaxies .",
    "it appears that there are no intergalactic gas clouds unassociated with optical counterparts : all those galaxies which have not been uniquely associated with a counterpart have more than one plausible candidate .",
    "we have measured effective radii and surface - brightnesses by fitting to the surface - brightness profiles of the optical sources using the ellipse routine in iraf .",
    "the total magnitudes used were determined by sextractor ( bertins & arnouts 1996 ) .",

    "the mass ( in solar masses ) is related to the integrated flux by the equation    @xmath85    ( for @xmath78 in jykms@xmath0 ) and the total flux is related to the peak flux and the velocity width ( figure [ tophat - peak ] ) by    @xmath86    this allows the mass to be related to the peak flux as :    @xmath87    however the velocity width is a function of the mass , @xmath88 ( although with a large scatter ) .",

    "since the relationship between velocity - width and mass has a large scatter this is not the absolute detection limit : sources narrower than predicted by this relationship will be seen further out , and sources wider than predicted will be found over a smaller volume . however , it does indicate the distance to which most sources of a given mass will be seen .    the relationship between mass and velocity - width suggests the possibility of a selection effect in hi surveys that appears to have been neglected in many previous surveys : that of a minimum believable velocity width . below a certain mass , the velocity - widths of many of the galaxies will be smaller than the minimum believable velocity - width of the survey  the width at which a peak in the data is recognised to be a galaxy rather than a noise peak  and will not be catalogued .",
    "a fuller analysis of this effect , using data from the hi jodrell all sky survey , is given in lang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "examination of the hideep data shows the minimum believable velocity - width to be around 4 channels wide for @xmath66 , or 52.8 kms@xmath0 .",
    "this selection effect means that detecting large numbers of low - mass galaxies will require not only sensitivity but also narrow channel - widths .",
    "however , this effect could remove at most @xmath93 per cent of @xmath94 galaxies here .",
    "if the thermal broadening of the hi is also taken into account , this percentage will fall .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that this will significantly change the shape of hi mass functions down to their current mass limits . for hideep ,",
    "the distance at which galaxies that would be above the mass limit will fall below the minimum believable velocity - width limit is about 18 mpc .",
    "figure [ mhilimits ] compares the hi mass sensitivity of three surveys : hideep , the hipass bright galaxy catalogue ( koribalski 2003 ; bgc ) and the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss ) .",
    "a minimum believable velocity - width of 4 channels has been applied to all these surveys although galaxies narrower than this can be seen if they have high peak signal to noise ratios .",
    "this will apply particularly to the hipass bgc , where the peak - flux cutoff of 116 mjy is more than 8@xmath39 . for ahiss",
    "a limit of 5.25 mjy , or seven times the stated noise value of 0.75 mjy per channel , was adopted .",
    "this appears consistent with an analysis of the fluxes and velocity widths from zwaan ( 2000 ) and with the analysis of schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which concluded that the ahiss survey was limited at 7@xmath39 due to the method of confirming sources . only the primary beam area was used in calculating the volume covered by ahiss .",
    "having estimated the sensitivity to sources in the mass - limited regime , we can also estimate the sensitivity to sources in the column - density limited regime .",
    "column - density sensitivity has often been presented , in a similar manner to optical surface - brightness , as not having a dependence on distance .",
    "however the relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath79 and the dependence of column - density sensitivity of @xmath73 ( see equation [ nhieqn2 ] ) means that this is not the case for single - dish surveys  the tendency of higher mass sources to have larger velocity widths means that they will ( a ) be seen to greater distances due to their higher mass and ( b ) will have a higher column - density limit due to their larger velocity width .    the column - density of a source filling the beam ( in @xmath95  pc@xmath5 ) is given by :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the hwhm of the telescope beam in radians and @xmath98 is the distance of the source in parsecs . it can easily be seen that @xmath9 is only independent of distance if the sensitivity of the telescope to @xmath79 goes as @xmath99 .",
    "this would only be the case if galaxies at all different hi masses had the same velocity - width or if the survey was limited by integrated - flux  neither of which are likely .",
    "there must , therefore , be a distance dependence for column - density sensitivity to average galaxies which follow the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath73 .",
    "putting in the @xmath79 sensitivity from equation [ mhi - sensitivity ] and the beam size of parkes ( 15 arcmin ) gives a column - density sensitivity for hideep of :    @xmath100        again , this will be affected by the minimum believable velocity - width limit .",

    "column 9 gives the distance in mpc calculated from the cmb rest - frame velocity of the sources , which is approximately @xmath107 kms@xmath0 for the hideep region ( the exact correction varies across the field ) .",
    "this does not include any correction for bulk - motions ( virgo - centric infall , etc . ) nor does it include assigning sources beyond the centaurus a group to clusters and assigning a single distance to that cluster .",
    "galaxies at less that 1000 kms@xmath0 have been assigned to the centaurus a group at an assumed distance of 3.5 mpc .",
    "column 10 gives the hi mass calculated from @xmath78 from column 5 and the distance from column 9 using the standard equation @xmath108 , where @xmath78 is in jy  kms@xmath0 .",

    "it is possible that the lack of correlation is due to the targeting of optical redshift surveys towards the abell clusters , thus increasing the number of redshifts in those regions out of proportion to their density .",
    "while abell 3571 and 1736 are both centred inside the hideep volume , at 11,500  kms@xmath0 and 10,500  kms@xmath0 respectively , abell 3558 and 3562 are both centred beyond 14,000  kms@xmath0 ( abell , corwin , & olowen 1989 ; quintana & de souza 1993 ) .",

    "we have not yet obtained high - resolution hi images of most of our sources so we do not know either their hi radii or column densities .",
    "we therefore calculate an inferred column - density ( @xmath110 ) from the hi mass and the optical ( effective ) radius .",

    "if our estimate of @xmath119 were out by more than a factor of three , we would expect to see a lower limit to our column densities parallel to the plotted completeness limit . as the lower limit appears flat with respect to velocity width",

    "the distribution of column densities appears to be the same at all surface brightnesses .",
    "a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( peacock 1983 ) shows that the observed distribution is indeed consistent with a distribution having the same column - density distribution as hideep ( fig .",

    "the distribution shown in figure [ nhihisto ] , is well described by a gaussian with @xmath127 .",

    "this was carried out ten times , and the subsamples compared with hideep using the two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "half of the subsamples were not significantly different at the 95% level .",
    "there are a number of systematics that could affect this comparison .",
    "our measure of @xmath114 could be systematically too small towards lower surface - brightnesses : this would lead to both @xmath110 and @xmath133 being higher and so would act to destroy such a relationship between @xmath9 and surface - brightness .",
    "the colours will not be exactly the same for all the galaxies , introducing errors into the conversion of the isib96 relationship to _ r_-band .",
    "the low column - density galaxies ( @xmath134  @xmath3 ) in isib96 are generally large galaxies , with @xmath135 .",
    "using our scaling between @xmath115 and @xmath136 , this gives them hi sizes larger than the arecibo beam .",
    "it is therefore likely that some of the hydrogen in these galaxies was missed in the pointed observations , leading to lower inferred column - densities than is truly the case .",
    "we can not , therefore , say that the hideep data is inconsistent with isib96 .",
    "if there is a relationship between surface - brightness and @xmath9 in our data , however , it is very weak indeed .",
    "the existence of a large population of lsb galaxies could have a significant impact on several areas of astronomy , in particular on measurements of the luminosity and mass density of galaxies and on theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "however , lsb objects are difficult to detect in the optical since , by definition , they are hard to discriminate from the background sky . hence , alternative techniques need to be considered for determining whether there exists a significant population of extragalactic objects with optically lsb .",
    "searches for galaxies using the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen provide one such alternative method .",
    "if lsb galaxies have similar hydrogen content to galaxies of higher surface brightness , then we might expect that a 21-cm survey will not be biased against lsb galaxies .",
    "however , the detection of a galaxy in a 21-cm survey is a function of both its hi column density and its hi mass .",
    "if a galaxy has a column density below the column density limit of the survey then it will never be detected whatever its total hi mass .",
    "assuming lsb galaxies have similar hi content to brighter galaxies but that this is distributed over a larger surface area , then we would expect lsb objects to have lower hi column densities .",
    "previous hi surveys have not generally had long enough integration times to search to sufficiently low column densities to draw definite conclusions about the cosmic prevalence of gas - rich lsb galaxies .",
    "hideep with its 9000sbeam@xmath0 integration time is the first survey with sufficient column density sensitivity to be able to place interesting limits on the existence and size of a low column - density / lsb population .",
    "two major conclusions from hideep have been presented here .",
    "firstly , all of the sources found in hideep appear to be associated with an optical counterpart on our deep uk schmidt r - band data . in other words , we have not found an intergalactic hi cloud down to our observational column density limit of n@xmath137/@xmath138v = 2.1@xmath13910@xmath140 @xmath3 which corresponds to an n@xmath137 of 4.2@xmath13910@xmath141 @xmath3 for a typical galaxy velocity - distribution ( @xmath138v=200  kms@xmath0 ) and 3.2@xmath13910@xmath142  @xmath3 for a typical qsoal dispersion ( 15  kms@xmath0 ) . wherever neutral hydrogen is found it is accompanied by a visible population of stars above our surface - brightness limit of 26.5  r magnitudes per square arcsecond ( @xmath14327.5 in b ) .",
    "secondly , if we infer the hi sizes of the hideep detections from their optical sizes , then we can derive hi column densities for them .",
    "these derived column densities are all @xmath14410@xmath145  @xmath3 , more than an order of magnitude above our observational limit . assuming that our method of inferring hi size from optical size is robust",
    ", then this result implies that there is no significant population of galaxies with hi column densities @xmath14610@xmath145  @xmath3 .",
    "we are currently undertaking a vla and atca survey of all the hideep sources in order to measure their column densities directly .",
    "this will enable us to test this result without having to infer hi size from optical size .",
    "possible physical explanations for this intriguing second result are discussed in detail elsewhere ( disney & minchin 2003 ) .",
    "ionisation is unlikely to be responsible since the intergalactic radiation field locally is at least an order to magnitude too small ( scott et al . 2002 ) .",
    "another possibility , raised in the early days of 21-cm astronomy , is ` freezing out '  i.e. that the 21-cm spin temperature of low column density objects may fall to the cosmic background temperature , rendering such clouds invisible in emission",
    ".    the cosmic significance of gas - rich low - surface brightness galaxies will be the subject of a subsequent paper based on this same data ( minchin et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) . however , the fact that we have not found a single galaxy in hi which can not be seen in our optical data suggests that there can not be large numbers of gas - rich extremely lsb galaxies or intergalactic clouds .",
    "if our second result is confirmed by the follow - up vla and atca observations , then this will imply that hi surveys need not have column density limits much lower than @xmath14310@xmath145  @xmath3 , since few galaxies would appear to have column densities lower than this . in particular , this would imply that previous large - area , shallow surveys , e.g. hipass and hijass , will not have missed many low - column density objects . however , long integrations using telescopes with smaller beams would improve the statistics on the numbers of low mass , low column - density sources .",
