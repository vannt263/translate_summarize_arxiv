    "in the last years there has been great interest in non - hermitian multidimensional oscillators with antiunitary symmetry @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a unitary operator and @xmath5 is the complex conjugation operation .",
    "these hamiltonians are of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is hermitian , @xmath8 and @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the interest in these oscillators stems from the fact that they appear to exhibit real eigenvalues for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases from @xmath11 two eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 approach each other , coalesce at an exceptional point @xmath14@xcite and become a pair of complex conjugate numbers for @xmath15 . at the exceptional point",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are no longer linearly independent@xcite .",
    "it is commonly said that the system exhibits a pt - phase transition at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the exceptional point closest to the origin@xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath12 of @xmath20 are real for all @xmath21 , where the antiunitary symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "based on the multidimensional non - hermitian oscillators studied so far , bender and weir@xcite conjectured that the pt phase transitions is a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "point - group symmetry ( pgs)@xcite proved useful for the study of a class of multidimensional anharmonic oscillators@xcite .",
    "klaiman and cederbaum@xcite applied pgs to non - hermitian hamiltonians chosen so that the point group @xmath22 for @xmath20 is a subgroup of the point group @xmath23 for @xmath7 .",
    "they restricted their study to abelian groups , which exhibit only one - dimensional irreducible representations ( irreps ) , and hermitian operators @xmath7 with no degenerate states .",
    "all such examples exhibit real eigenvalues for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 .",
    "one of their goals was to predict the symmetry of the eigenfunctions associated to the eigenvalues that coalesce at the exceptional points and coined the term space - time ( st ) symmetry that refers to a class of antiunitary symmetries that contain the pt symmetry as a particular case .",
    "strictly speaking we refer to pt symmetry when @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the collections of coordinate and momenta operators , respectively .",
    "the main interest in the studies of pt - symmetric multidimensional oscillators just mentioned has been to enlarge the class of non - hermitian hamiltonians that exhibit real spectra , at least for some values of the potential parameter @xmath1 . on the other hand , by means of pgs fernndez and garcia@xcite found some examples of st - symmetric multidimensional models that exhibit complex eigenvalues for @xmath28 so that the phase transition takes place at the trivial hermitian limit @xmath29 .",
    "their results suggest that the more general st symmetry is not as robust as the pt one and contradict some of the conjectures put forward by klaiman and cederbaum@xcite based on pgs . by means of pgs and perturbation",
    "theory we have considerably improved the results , arguments and conclusions of those earlier papers and also found a greater class of st - symmetric multidimensional models with broken st symmetry for all values of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "those results show in a more clearly way that the conjecture of klaiman and cederbaum does not apply to the general case where the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath7 may exhibit degenerate states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the study of some tri - dimensional non - hermitian oscillators by means of pgs . in section  [ sec : diagonalization ]",
    "we discuss the diagonalization of the matrix representation of the hamiltonian operator in symmetry - adapted basis sets . by means of pgs and perturbation",
    "theory we develop a straightforward strategy that appears to be suitable for determining whether the hamiltonian will have real eigenvalues for sufficiently small nonzero values of the parameter @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : example1 ] we choose a non - hermitian oscillator discussed earlier by bender and weir@xcite as an illustrative example and exploit the fact that it exhibits @xmath0 symmetry . in section",
    "[ sec : example2 ] we discuss a non - hermitian oscillator where @xmath7 and @xmath31 exhibits symmetry @xmath32 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "several approaches have been applied to the calculation of the spectra of the st - symmetric multidimensional oscillators : the diagonalization method@xcite , perturbation theory@xcite , classical and semiclassical approaches@xcite , among others@xcite .",
    "the diagonalization method consists of expanding the eigenfunctions @xmath33 of @xmath20 as linear combinations of a suitable basis set @xmath34 @xmath35 and then diagonalizing an @xmath36 matrix representation of the hamiltonian @xmath37 with elements @xmath38 , where @xmath39 stands for the c - product@xcite .",
    "such matrices are complex and symmetric @xmath40 but obviously not hermitian .    in this paper",
    "we take into account that the non - hermitian multidimensional oscillators exhibit pgs and choose basis sets adapted to the irreps of the point group @xmath22 of @xmath20 . in this way we can split the matrix representation @xmath37 into representations @xmath41 for each symmetry @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath20 are bases for the irreps of @xmath22 and can be written as linear combinations @xmath43 of the elements of the symmetry - adapted basis sets @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath41 are given by @xmath45 and the separate treatment of each symmetry is justified by the fact that @xmath46 if @xmath47@xcite .",
    "that is to say : functions of different symmetry do not mix .",
    "the construction of symmetry - adapted basis sets is straightforward and is described in most textbooks on group theory@xcite .",
    "one applies a projection operator @xmath48 to a basis function @xmath49 and obtains a symmetry - adapted function @xmath50 . if the irrep @xmath42 is one - dimensional it is only necessary to normalize the resulting function @xmath50 ; otherwise it may be necessary to combine two or more functions @xmath50 to obtain a set of orthonormal functions@xcite .    in what follows",
    "we apply this approach to two non - hermitian three - dimensional oscillators of the form @xmath51 where @xmath7 is hermitian and @xmath1 is real . in particular",
    ", we consider the case that both @xmath7 and @xmath20 exhibit eigenspaces of dimension greater than one .    in the examples discussed in this paper the symmetry of @xmath7",
    "is given by the point group @xmath52 : @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath31 is invariant under the operations of a subgroup @xmath54 of @xmath23 ( @xmath55 ) then @xmath20 is invariant under the operations of the point group @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that there exists a unitary operator @xmath56 @xmath57 with the following properties : i ) it forms a class by itself ( that is to say : @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) so that @xmath60 , ii ) it changes the sign of @xmath31 @xmath61 . under these conditions @xmath20 exhibits the antiunitary symmetry given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath5 is the complex conjugation operation introduced earlier .",
    "if @xmath64 is an eigenfunction of @xmath65 with eigenvalue @xmath66 then @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , as follows from @xmath69=0 $ ] and @xmath70 . therefore , @xmath71 if @xmath72 .",
    "it was shown in our earlier papers that complex eigenvalues appear for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 when @xmath7 exhibits degenerate eigenfunctions and at least one of the perturbation corrections of first order produced by @xmath31 is nonzero@xcite .",
    "the degenerate eigenfunctions of @xmath7@xmath73 exhibit the same behaviour with respect to @xmath74 : @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 and all the perturbation corrections of first order vanish ( see reference@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the main conclusion drawn from the discussion above is that the space - time symmetry given by @xmath77 may not be broken when the space transformation given by @xmath78 forms a class by itself .",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by all the examples discussed in our earlier paper@xcite where we concluded that the inversion operation @xmath79 is a suitable choice for @xmath74 .",
    "note that in all the point groups @xmath80 forms a class by itself@xcite .",
    "as a first example we choose the non - hermitian oscillator @xmath81 studied by bender and weir@xcite . when @xmath11 the resulting isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath7 may be described by the 3d rotation group ( the group of all rotations about the origin of the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath82 under the operation of composition ) .",
    "its eigenfuctions in cartesian coordinates are @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an eigenfunction of @xmath85 , and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath86 are @xmath87-fold degenerate .",
    "when @xmath88 the symmetry of the model is determined by @xmath89 and the suitable point group is @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding character table is shown in table  [ tab : td ] . in this case",
    "the obvious choice is @xmath90 that satisfies all the conditions outlined in section  [ sec : diagonalization ] .",
    "the application of the projection procedure outlined in section  [ sec : diagonalization ] to the eigenfunctions of @xmath7 yields the following symmetry - adapted basis set for @xmath91@xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 by means of projection operators one can also prove that the perturbation @xmath89 splits the degenerate states of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath7 in the following way : @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes all the distinct permutations of the labels @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "bender and weir@xcite diagonalized truncated matrix representations @xmath37 of the hamiltonian operator of dimension @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in order to estimate the accuracy of their results .",
    "they resorted to well known efficient diagonalization routines for sparse matrices . here , we diagonalize matrix representations @xmath41 for @xmath104 .",
    "this splitting reduces the dimension of the matrices required for a given accuracy and also enables a clearer interpretation and discussion of the results . in this paper we carried out all the calculations with matrices of dimension @xmath105 for each irrep .",
    "comparison of such results for @xmath106 with those coming from a calculation with matrices of dimension @xmath107 did not show any relevant difference for present purposes and discussion .",
    "figures [ fig : ho_a1]-[fig : ho_t2 ] show @xmath108 for the five irreps . for clarity we split every case into two or three energy intervals where we can appreciate the occurrence of crossings , coalescence of eigenvalues at exceptional points and even what appear to be avoided crossings .",
    "because of the scale used and the separation into irreps our figures reveal a reach pattern of intertwined energy curves that one can not easily discern when plotting all the symmetries together@xcite .",
    "bender and weir@xcite estimated a phase transition near to @xmath109 for their hamiltonian @xmath110 .",
    "the relation between present exceptional points and those of bender and weir is therefore @xmath111 .",
    "figure [ fig : ho_ime ] shows the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues for each irrep .",
    "we appreciate that complex eigenvalues appear for values of the parameter that are considerably smaller than @xmath112 ; therefore , we can not be sure that there is a phase transition for this hamiltonian . as the energy increases more exceptional points seems to emerge closer to the origin",
    ".    all the figures in this paper have been produced by means of the tikz package@xcite .",
    "the non - hermitian anharmonic oscillator @xmath113 is interesting because @xmath7 is invariant under the unitary operations of the point group @xmath32 and @xmath20 is invariant under those of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath97 denotes all distinct permutations of the subscripts in the eigenfunctions @xmath114 , @xmath115 , of @xmath7 , then their symmetry is given by(see reference@xcite for a discussion of an exactly solvable quantum - mechanical problem with the same pgs ) :",
    "@xmath116    the character table for the point group @xmath32 is shown in table  [ tab : oh ] .",
    "the dynamical symmetries that are responsible for the degeneracy of eigenfunctions belonging to different irreps ( which can not be explained by pgs ) are given by the hermitian operators @xmath117 they belong to the irrep @xmath118 and commute with @xmath65 .",
    "we easily obtain them by straightforward application of the projection operator @xmath119 to the two pairs of functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 as discussed elsewhere@xcite .    by means of projection operators",
    "we can prove that the eigenfunctions of @xmath7 transform into those of @xmath20 according to the following symmetry scheme : @xmath122    clearly , @xmath123 leaves @xmath20 invariant . since @xmath80 forms a class by itself",
    "as shown by the character table  [ tab : oh ] then this antiunitary symmetry is expected to be unbroken for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 according to the discussion in section  [ sec : diagonalization ] .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the figures [ fig : q_a1]-[fig : im_q ] where we see that there are real eigenvalues for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 for the five irreps .",
    "however , the values of @xmath14 approach the origin as the eigenvalues increase in such a way that it is difficult to estimate whether there is a high - energy phase transition .",
    "it is also worth noting that the pattern of @xmath124 vs @xmath1 is not the same for all the irreps .",
    "the most striking difference occurs between the irreps @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "in this paper we have studied a few examples of non - hermitian hamiltonian operators of the form ( [ eq : h_gen ] ) with a space - time symmetry given by an antiunitary operator @xmath62 .",
    "the space transformation @xmath74 satisfies @xmath127 and @xmath61 . under such conditions",
    "our conjecture is that one expects real eigenvalues for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 when @xmath74 forms a class by itself in the point group @xmath23 that describes the symmetry of @xmath7 .",
    "this conclusion is suggested by the fact that the perturbation corrections of first order for all the energy levels vanish .",
    "all the known examples with real spectrum already satisfy this condition@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the recently found space - time symmetric hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues for @xmath128@xcite clearly violate it .",
    "although present proof based on pgs and perturbation theory is not as conclusive as one may desire , at least the examples studied so far support it .",
    "in addition to what was said above , there remains the question whether there is a phase transition in those cases where the eigenvalues are real for @xmath129 . as @xmath130 increases the critical values of @xmath1 approach the origin and it is quite difficult to estimate if there is a nonzero limit .",
