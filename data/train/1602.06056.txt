    "we develop a data - driven but physics - based method for modeling planar friction .",
    "manipulations employing friction are ubiquitous in tasks including positioning and orienting objects by pushing @xcite , controlled slip with dexterous hands @xcite and assembly of tight - fitting parts @xcite . in the case of planar robot pushing , indeterminacy of the pressure distribution between the object and support surface leads to uncertainty in the resultant velocity given a particular push action . despite such inherent difficulty , algorithms and analysis have been developed with provable guarantees .",

    ", we can improve strategies for planning and control .",
    "our contribution lies in developing a precise and statistically - efficient ( i.e. , requiring only a few collected force - velocity data pairs ) model with a computationally efficient identification procedure .",

    "we refer the readers to @xcite for details of friction analysis for planar sliding under isotropic coulomb friction law . in this paper",
    ", we build our analysis on a generalized friction law formulated first in @xcite , in which @xmath2 and @xmath4 may not be parallel , but only need to obey the maximum work inequality : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary element from the set of all possible static and kinetic friction forces .",

    "the set of all generalized friction loads form a convex set @xmath15 .",
    "an important work that inspires us is goyal et al .",
    "@xcite who found that all possible generalized friction loads during sliding form a limit surface ( ls ) constructed from the minkowsky sum of limit curves at individual support points .",
    "points inside the surface correspond to static friction loads .",
    "points on the surface correspond to friction loads with normals parallel to sliding velocity directions , forming a mapping between generalized friction load and sliding velocity .",
    "an ideal ls is always convex due to the maximum work inequality but may not be strictly convex when a single point supports finite pressure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : robot_lc_ideal ] , facets can occur since the object can rotate about one of the three support points whose velocity is zero with indeterminate underlying friction .",
    "erdmann @xcite proposed a configuration space embedding of friction . in his work , the third component of @xmath11 is @xmath16 and the third component of @xmath10 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of gyration . in doing so , all three components in @xmath11 and",

    ", we have found that the normalized representation yields better numerical condition and different values of @xmath18 including radius of gyration , average edge length and minimum enclosing circle radius lead to similar performance .",
    "yoshikawa and kurisu @xcite solved an unconstrained least - squares problem to estimate the center of friction and the pressure distribution over discrete grids on the contact surface . with similar set up , lynch @xcite proposed a constrained linear programming procedure to avoid negative pressure assignment .",
    "however , methods based on discretization of the support surface introduce two sources of error in both localization of support points and pressure assignment among those points",
    ". we do not need to estimate the exact location of support points .",
    "coarse discretization loses accuracy while fine discretization unnecessarily increases the dimensionality of estimation and model complexity .",
    "howe and cutkosky @xcite presented an ellipsoid approximation of the limit surface assuming known pressure distribution .",
    "the ellipsoid was constructed by computing or measuring the major axis lengths ( maximum force during pure translation and maximum torque during pure rotation ) .",
    "facets can be added by intersecting the ellipsoid with planes determined by each support point .",
    "the pressure distribution ( except for 3 points support with known center of pressure ) , nevertheless , is non - trivial to measure or compute . we also show that the ellipsoid approximation , as a special case of our convex polynomial representation , is less accurate due to lack of expressiveness .",
    "recent data - driven attempts @xcite collected visual data from random push trials and applied `` off - the - shelf '' machine learning algorithms to build motion models .",
    "we also embrace a data - driven strategy but bear in mind that physics principles should guide the design of the learning algorithm ( as constraints and/or priors ) , hence reducing sample complexity and increasing generalization performance .",
    "in this section , we propose the sublevel set representation of friction with desired properties and show that convex even - degree homogeneous polynomials are valid solutions .",
    "then we formulate an efficient convex optimization procedure to identify such polynomials .",
    "let @xmath19 be a differentiable convex function that models the generalized friction load and velocity as follows :    * the @xmath20-sublevel set @xmath21 corresponds to the convex set @xmath15 of all generalized friction loads .",
    "* the @xmath20-level set @xmath22 corresponds to generalized friction loads ( during slip ) on the boundary surface of @xmath15 . *",
    "the surface normals given by gradients @xmath23 represent instantaneous generalized velocity directions during slip , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    [",
    "theorem : levelset ] the set of friction loads represented by the @xmath20-sublevel set of a differentiable convex function follows the maximum work inequality .",
    "when the object remains static , @xmath11 belongs to the interior of @xmath26 and @xmath10 equals zero , the inequality holds as equality . when the object slips , @xmath27 and @xmath10 is nonzero , we have for any other generalized friction load @xmath28 : @xmath29 where the first inequality is due to the convexity of @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to enforcing convexity ( discussed in [ sec : sos_convex ] ) , we choose @xmath19 to obey the following properties :    1 .",
    "symmetry : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "scale invariance : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a positive scalar function .",
    "efficient invertibility : there exists efficient numerical procedure to find a @xmath34 such that @xmath35 for a given query unit velocity @xmath10 .",
    "we denote such operation as @xmath36 .",
    "symmetry is based on the assumption that negating the velocity direction would only result in a sign change in the friction load .",
    "scale invariance is desired for two reasons : 1 ) scaling in mass and surface coefficient of friction could only result in a change of scale but not other geometrical properties of the level - set representation ; and 2 ) predicting directions of generalized velocities ( by computing gradients and normalizing to a unit vector ) only depends on the direction of generalized force .",
    "such a property is useful in the context of pushing with robot fingers where applied loads are represented by friction cones .",
    "the inverse problem of finding the friction load for a given velocity naturally appears in seeking quasi - static balance for stable pushing or computing deceleration during free sliding , as shown in section [ sec : application ] . in general , efficient numerical solution to the inverse problem , which our representation enables ,",
    "is key to planning and simulation .",
    "one solution family for @xmath19 that obeys these properties is the set of * strongly convex even - degree homogeneous polynomials*.    [ theorem : homogcvx ] a strongly convex even degree-@xmath37 homogeneous polynomial @xmath38 with @xmath39 monomial terms is bounded by @xmath40 .",
    "] parametrized by @xmath41 satisfies the properties of symmetry , scale invariance , and efficient invertibility .",
    "proving symmetry and scale invariance are trivial due to the homogeneous and even - degree form of @xmath19 . here , we sketch the proof that efficient invertibility can be achieved by first solving a simple non - linear least square problem followed by a rescaling .",

    "has a straightforward set up as solving a semi - definite programming problem with constraint of @xmath56 .",
    "meanwhile , for a polynomial of degree greater than 2 whose hessian matrix @xmath57 is a function of both @xmath11 and @xmath41 , certification of positive semi - definiteness is np - hard .",
    "however , recent progress @xcite in sum - of - squares programming has given powerful semi - definite relaxations of global positiveness certification of polynomials .",
    "specifically , let @xmath58 be an arbitrary non - zero vector in @xmath59 and @xmath60^t$ ] .",
    "if there exists a positive - definite matrix @xmath61 such that @xmath62 then @xmath57 is positive definite for all non - zero @xmath11 under parameter @xmath41 and @xmath63 is called as sos - convex .",

    "this section sets up an efficient convex optimization for identifying the coefficient @xmath41 of the polynomial @xmath63 given a set of measured noisy generalized force - motion @xmath69 pairs . in our experiments",
    ", we use homogeneous 4th order polynomial .",
    "the optimization should find the coefficient @xmath41 such that the measured forces @xmath70 are close to the 1-level set surface and the corresponding gradients are aligned well ( up to scale ) w.r.t measured velocities @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the l2-projection residual of @xmath73 onto the measured unit velocity vector @xmath74 , and let @xmath75 be a distance measurement of @xmath70 from the 1-level set of @xmath76 .",

    "note that the objective is quadratic in @xmath41 with sparse linear constraints and a semi - definite constraint on @xmath61 .",
    "we would like to point out that the formulation can be adapted online using projected gradient descent so that the importance of historical data is diminishing as the object moves , enabling the estimation to adapt to changing surface conditions .",

    "[ fig : simbar_4 ] , when enough training data ( more than 22 ) is presented , poly4 performs slightly better than poly4-convex .",
