    "<S> we study the effects of the environment at zero temperature on tunneling in an open system described by a static double - well potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the evolution of the system in an initial schrdinger cat state , can be summarized in terms of three main physical phenomena , namely decoherence , quantum tunneling and noise - induced activation . using large - scale numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a detailed picture of the main stages of the evolution and of the relevant dynamical processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier is a fundamental effect in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic quantum tunneling can be associated with the tunneling of a many - body wavefunction through a potential barrier , and therefore provides a more stringent test of the validity of quantum mechanics than one particle case . </S>",
    "<S> one place where the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling is experimentally accesible is in the tunneling of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) out of an optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> these systems have a controllable number of atoms and hence straddle the boundary between microscopic and macroscopic , and hence between quantum and classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> proposals to perform interference experiments using confined atoms @xcite rely on the separation and merger of two potential wells to split and recombine atomic wave packets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> becs in a two - well potential have been created in experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atom - atom interactions tend to localize particles in either potential well and reduce the coherence of the splitting and recombination processes @xcite , whereas tunneling serves to delocalize the atomic wave packets and keeps a well - defined relative phase between the potential wells .    </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic systems are generally open systems , interacting with an external environment , and in this context quantum tunneling @xcite is qualitatively different from its experimentally verified microscopic analogue @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of open systems has led to interesting results , detailing the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath with arbitrary temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a closed quantum system described by a state localized around a meta - stable minimum , should tunnel through the potential barrier with a well defined time - scale . </S>",
    "<S> this tunneling time can be estimated using standard techniques such as the instaton method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for an open system , on the other hand , it is well known that the environment induces decoherence on the quantum particle , its behavior becoming classical as soon as interference terms are destroyed by the external noise . </S>",
    "<S> this transition from a quantum to a classical behavior is forced by the interaction with a robust environment and takes place at a given time - scale , the decoherence time . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity depends on the properties of the system , its environment and their mutual coupling . </S>",
    "<S> if the decoherence time is significantly smaller than the tunneling time , one would expect that after classicalization the state should become confined to the meta - stable vacuum ( or potential well ) , with tunneling being suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the particle could still cross the barrier but only if excited by the bath , its energy increasing via thermal activation , for example . </S>",
    "<S> this process is distinct from quantum tunneling , is classical in its nature and should be efficient mostly at high environmental temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question arises : what is the effect on tunneling if the particle is coupled to a reservoir at zero temperature ? </S>",
    "<S> though in this case there should be in principle no thermal activation , we know there is decoherence induced by a quantum environment at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to classicalization and one could conclude that even at @xmath0 , quantum tunneling should be inhibited by the interaction with the external environment @xcite .    the study of the effects of an external environment on tunneling was initiated in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that dissipation inhibits tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> authors consider a two level limit of a particle in a double - potential well with hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the detuning frequency . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , the eigenstates can be writen as combinations of antisymmetric and symmetric states : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> the probability to stay on the right or left well is given by an oscillatory function : @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this result has no classical analog , and this is the genuine expression of the phase coherence between the states ( i.e. nh3 inversion coherence ) . in the case </S>",
    "<S> this two level system is coupled to a reservoir ( spin - boson model ) , the tunneling is inhibited by the dissipation in the limit of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the debye frequency of the environment ) and @xmath9 ( low temperature limit ) @xcite .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have studied a general tunneling system described by a static hamiltonian . specifically , we have looked in detail at the evolution of a particle in a quantum state localized at one of the minima of a double well potential , when coupled to an external environment at both zero and high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented analytical descriptions of the effects of dissipation and diffusion , and estimated the time - scales associated with the distinct physical processes governing the dynamics of the system : decoherence , quantum tunneling and activation . </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting extension of previous analysis is to study superpositions of macroscopic quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> this is a crucial aspect when analyzing becs in double - well traps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our goal here is to extend our previous considerations about decoherence , tunneling and noise - induced activation to the case of an initial coherent superposition of two gaussian wave packets . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between atoms in finite size affect the coherence and the relative phase undergoes diffusion due to the presence of a condensate self - interaction and also the interaction between condensate and non - condensate atoms creates decoherence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the experiments on becs of dilute alkali - metal atomic gases , trapped atoms are evaporatively cooled and exchange particles with their environment . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic quantun coherence of becs results in coherent quantum tunneling of atoms between the two modes , analogously to the coherent tunneling of cooper pairs in a josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our motivation is to see how robust is the quantum coherence between becs in the presence of the environment at zero temperature , and how the tunneling process is affected . </S>",
    "<S> it is of big importance the study of the transition from a coherent to an incoherent regime associated with the increase of fluctuations of the relative phase between condensates confined in each of the different traps .    </S>",
    "<S> we will start by considering an anharmonic trap given by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a double well potential with two absolute minima at @xmath11 separated by a potential barrier with height @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the system ( bec ) is open , meaning that it is coupled to an environment composed of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators , by which we model the interaction with the non - condensate atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the non - linear potential can be obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the environment and obtaining a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the initial states of the system and environment are uncorrelated , with the latter being in thermal equilibrium at zero temperature for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> only when the interaction is turned on the system is allowed to evolve and the initial condition is not an equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> as we are interested in studying tunneling - like phenomena , we will estimate the tunneling time @xmath15 by looking at the evolution of a state for which the particle is initially localized in one of the sides of the double potential well . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we found that in general @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energies of the symmetric / anti - symmetric eigenstates respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference and corresponding tunneling time can be obtained by a straightforward instanton calculation @xcite , the final result being @xmath19}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the expression inside the exponential is the classical action for the instanton , @xmath20 .    for the open case , we focus on ohmic environments with spectral density @xmath21 at @xmath0 ( @xmath22 is the dissipation constant and @xmath8 the frequency cutoff ) . </S>",
    "<S> after a rather lengthy calculation , the master equation at @xmath0 on the basis of eigenstates of the isolated system can be written as @xcite @xmath23 where the time dependent complex coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this expressions , @xmath28 , is the frequency difference between eigenstates @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the set of coefficients @xmath31 encapsulates the effects of diffusion at @xmath0 , with @xmath32 representing the normal diffusion and @xmath33 the anomalous one . </S>",
    "<S> the others coefficients represent the effect of the environment through the dissipation kernel @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the frequency shift , and @xmath36 the dissipation coefficient ( see analytical expressions in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically solved equation  ( [ mastert=0 ] ) , in the under - damped case , using a standard adaptative step - size fifth order runge - kutta method for different parameters of the system and the environment . </S>",
    "<S> all results were found to be robust under changes on the parameters of the integration method . from the solution of ( [ mastert=0 ] ) we will show the wigner function and the probability distributions of the main system at any time @xcite .    as an example we have chosen @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the system for which the estimated tunneling time scale is @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we set the frequency cutoff to @xmath40 . with this set of parameters , the effects of the frequency shift in the initial state </S>",
    "<S> can be neglected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence time @xmath41 has been analytically evaluated in @xcite , getting a bounded value @xmath42 for very flat potentials , and @xmath43 for large values of @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the wigner function of the system for the indicated times , both for the isolated and open systems . </S>",
    "<S> the initial schrdinger cat state is depicted in the first picture of each row ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> black fringes denote the quantum interference terms present in the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> already at very early times , the negative regions of @xmath45 are considerably suppressed for the open case when compared to the closed system , suggesting that decoherence has a crucial role in the evolution . for @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath45 becomes positive definite and the open system displays no tunneling interferences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence inhibits tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> once the interferences are destroyed , the spread of the wigner function increases as a consequence of diffusion induced by the environment . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , decoherence has clearly been effective by the time the wigner function is strictly positive every - where . </S>",
    "<S> as the tunneling time is reached , though the system is localized on the original wells , the wigner function explores a large region of the phase space . on the contrary , for the closed system </S>",
    "<S> , negative values in the center of the phase space clearly indicate quantum behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the isolated system is tunneling from one to the other well .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we show the probability distribution @xmath47 for the isolated and open systems for the indicated times , measured in units of the estimated tunneling time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthy of note that for the closed case the state keeps its phase coherence and the tunneling effect is present . </S>",
    "<S> the state is localized on the original wells and the evolution is clearly unitary . in the open case , even though the system is still localized on the original wells for early times , the probability spreads due to the diffusion induced by the environment . </S>",
    "<S> probability differs from the closed case owing to the noise - induced diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 starts spreading for early times . </S>",
    "<S> by @xmath49 there is nonzero probability at the position of the barrier ; clearly indicating that there is probability crossing the barrier but not by tunnel effect ( as we have shown in the wigner pictures , the system is already classical by the tunneling time ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the probability over the barrier grows in time , reaching an uniform value asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that there is a process of energy activation induced by the presence of the environment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when trying to interpret the post - decoherence behaviour of the open system , several features of its dynamics should be kept in mind . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one should emphasize that the initial condition is clearly not the ground state of the composite system . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the interaction between the main system and the environment is turned on , at @xmath14 , the system will find itself in an excited state . in relation to the new minima of the potential </S>",
    "<S> , the environment will have a non - zero amount of energy . from a purely classical point of view , this energy can not be responsible for the excitation of the particles over the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the height of the potential increases in relation to the new vacuum , in such a way that the _ total _ energy of the full system is still lower than the barrier separating regions of positive and negative @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> note the fact that there are no fluctuations in the environment classically at t=0 , plays a crucial role in this reasoning . even for small but finite t </S>",
    "<S> , the energy of the environment would go as t. by choosing t small enough , this contribution could always be made smaller than the barrier height . as a consequence , and in contrast with the high - t case , we will not be able to describe the evolution of the quantum system after classicalization by simply taking its classical exact equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations present in the initial state of the environment must play a role in the `` activation '' . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that these fluctuations are not  vacuum fluctuations \" of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum nature of the environment , which could be ignored at high - t , leads in this limit to important non - negligible effects .    in terms of the master equation , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations of the bath oscillators generate non - zero @xmath51 and @xmath52 terms , making diffusive phenomena possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true in the case of the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath51 that depends logarithmically on the cutoff @xmath8 and thus can be considerably large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion effects induced by quantum fluctuations are thus responsible for exciting the particles over the potential barrier .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of decoherence and excitation processes in the @xmath0 case deserves a deeper insigh . for both quantities , the value of the environment frequency cutoff @xmath8 , seems to play an important role , affecting both the decoherence time , and the excitation process in the same direction . since we do not have explicit estimates of the `` activation '' time in terms of @xmath8 , it is hard to predict whether there is a regime for which decoherence happens fast enough and excitation is considerably delayed . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] suggests that this is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> the figure show the mean energy and its dispersion as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> also in the inset , we show the energy of the main system for several choices of the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 varies from the smallest frequency present in the system ; i.e. the difference between the first exited and the ground state energy levels , @xmath53 ; and @xmath54 . also shown </S>",
    "<S> are two intermediate cutoff values , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by lowering @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the `` activation '' time is indeed postponed , but so is decoherence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation the particles are simply able to tunnel back and forth the two minima for a longer period . </S>",
    "<S> higher values of the cutoff , on the other hand lead to both fast decoherence and fast `` activation '' . as a result we were never able to localize the particle on one of the wells , with tunneling and `` activation '' being simultaneously suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion in the energy distribution @xmath57 shows that fluctuations in the environment at @xmath58 are non - neglegible for large values of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter have a faster growth in time and reach a bigger final value than the mean energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> noise - induced energy activation is a consequence of this fact .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank n. antunes for his collaboration on this project . </S>",
    "<S> we also thanks b.l . </S>",
