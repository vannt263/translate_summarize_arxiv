    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the x - ray emission around accreting supermassive black holes is very bright and highly variable on timescales of hours to days @xcite .",
    "x - ray timing analysis can therefore be a very powerful tool for probing the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in this work ,",
    "we study the x - ray reverberation time delays , which measure the size scales of the innermost regions in physical units , and not just gravitational units ( i.e. in kilometres rather than in gravitational radii ) .",
    "reverberation , can therefore , in principal provide independent estimates of the black hole mass and spin .",
    "x - ray reverberation is due to the light crossing time of photons around the accreting black hole .",
    "the first robust discovery was made by @xcite for the narrow - line seyfert i galaxy , 1h0707 - 495 . in that work , the authors measured that the high - frequency variability in the reflection - dominated soft band ( 0.31  kev ) was delayed with respect to the continuum - dominated hard band ( 14  kev ) by 30  s. this was interpreted as the light travel distance between the x - ray emitting corona , and the reprocessed emission off the inner accretion disc where strong gravity effects are important .",
    "later findings of this high - frequency ` soft ' lag in other nls1s confirmed the detection @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite and later by @xcite model this time lag using general - relativistic ray - tracing simulations @xcite , and compute that these lags come from small radii within @xmath0 of the central supermassive black hole . at low - frequencies ,",
    "a separate process dominates the lags , and instead of a soft band lag , there is a hard band lag .",
    "this low - frequency hard lag has been observed in black hole binaries @xcite and agn @xcite . while its origin is not well understood ,",
    "the prevailing interpretation is that the lags are due to mass accretion rate fluctuations in the disc that propagate inwards and are transferred up to the corona , causing the soft continuum emission from large radii to respond before the hard emission at small radii @xcite .",
    "while the high - frequency soft lag was detected in a number of sources , the interpretation was still a contentious issue .",
    "@xcite and later @xcite suggested an alternative interpretation for the soft lags . in these papers ,",
    "the authors interpret the high - frequency soft lag as a mathematical oscillatory effect from low - frequency , distant reverberation off a reprocessing medium at @xmath1 . the low - frequency , hard lag ,",
    "is then understood as the long - timescale reverberation lag .",
    "the frequency - dependence of the soft lag could be similarly well modelled with a distant reprocessor .",
    "however , the discovery of the high - frequency iron k reverberation lag has put further constraints on physical models , confirming the relativistic reflection interpretation . @xcite",
    "first discovered the iron k reverberation lag in the bright seyfert galaxy , ngc  4151 . in that work , the authors computed the high - frequency lag - energy spectrum and found that the continuum emission varies first , followed by a delayed response in the red wing of the line , and lastly by the line centroid .",
    "this is naturally understood as the reverberation off the inner accretion disc , where there is a smaller light travel time between variations of the corona and the innermost radii ( where the red wing is produced ) , than between the corona and the larger radii of the accretion disc ( where the line centroid originates ) . since this initial discovery",
    ", the high - frequency iron k lag has been found in a number of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that while there are strong signatures of reflection in the high - frequency lags , the low - frequency lags are featureless , and are not clearly associated with any reflection @xcite . in one source ,",
    "ngc  6814 , where the spectrum is well described with only an absorbed powerlaw and minimal neutral reflection , there is still a clear low - frequency , hard lag @xcite , which further indicates that this low - frequency hard lag is _ not _ associated with reflection , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "lastly , detailed gr ray - tracing models by @xcite have also been shown to describe the high - frequency lags well @xcite .",
    "the next frontier for reverberation lag studies is to extend the lag - energy spectrum up to high energies above 10  kev , where the reflected emission peaks .",
    "this is now possible with the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the first high - energy focusing x - ray telescope in orbit . _ nustar _ is 100 times more sensitive than previous instruments probing the 10 - 80  kev range , and in the past two years has made significant contributions in measuring the high - energy spectra of agn .",
    "this started with seyfert galaxy ngc  1365 , where the reflection feature of the compton hump was clearly detected @xcite .",
    "since then , the compton hump has been confirmed in a number of other objects that contain broad iron lines , including mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , and mrk 335 @xcite .",
    "now that the compton hump has been confirmed in the energy spectrum , we want to search for the feature in the lags .",
    "@xcite presented the first analysis of high - frequency time lags above 10  kev , and we expand on this work with an analysis of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 .",
    "swift j2127.4 + 5654 ( @xmath2 ) is a nls1 galaxy that was first detected with the _ swift_/bat in the 15150  kev band @xcite .",
    "the source was observed in 2007 with _",
    "suzaku_-xis for 92  ks @xcite .",
    "the authors detected a broad fe  k emission line , which they used to infer a black hole spin of @xmath3 .",
    "the result was confirmed by @xcite , and later by @xcite using a 130  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "@xcite presented the 300  ks joint _",
    "xmm - newton_/_nustar _ observation of this source , confirming the broadened fe  k emission line and discovering a clear compton hump .",
    "also in that work , we analysed the _ xmm - newton _ data and found a high - frequency fe  k reverberation lag that was not as broad spectrally as those found in sources with maximally spinning black holes .",
    "this reverberation result independently confirmed a narrower relativistically broadened iron line and a compact x - ray source in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "ngc  1365 ( @xmath4 ) is a seyfert 1.9 galaxy that also shows strong evidence for a relativistically broadened iron line , this time implying a maximally spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is known to have complex and variable absorption , with evidence for a warm absorber and even cold , eclipsing material along the line of sight in some observations @xcite .",
    "recently , the source was observed for four _ xmm - newton _ orbits in the joint _ xmm - newton_/_nustar _ agn campaign .",
    "the four observations show remarkable variability , and @xcite has recently shown that this variability can largely be explained by absorption variability , and that underlying the complex absorption structure , the relativistically broadened iron line and compton hump are always present . orbit 3 of this observation was the most unobscured of the 4 observations .",
    "principal component analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ observations also showed that orbit 3 has the most intrinsic source variability , though some absorption variability is still present @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we focus our time lag analysis on orbit 3 , but show results from the other more absorbed orbits , which yield no evidence of fe  k reverberation lags .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ obs_sec ] we describe the two types of lag analysis used in this work , the standard fourier technique and the more recently developed maximum - likelihood technique for unevenly sampled light curves @xcite .",
    "we present our results for swift j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 in section  [ results ] and discuss them in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "all of the data used in this work come from the joint _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ agn campaign , where observations were taken simultaneously ( table  [ obs ] ) .",
    "swift j2127.4 + 5654 was observed with both instruments for 300  ks , and ngc  1365 was observed for 500  ks .",
    "we use data from the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observatory @xcite taken with the epic - pn camera @xcite . a detailed description of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ data reduction for swift j2127.4 + 5654 can be found in @xcite , and for ngc  1365 in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray signals from accreting black holes are highly variable ( as seen in figs .",
    "[ 2127_lc ] and [ 1365_lc ] , which show the light curves of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 in _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ ) . in agn ,",
    "the variability is observed on a range of timescales from hours to days , and this fact allows us to measure time delays between light curves of different energies .",
    "there are several approaches to measuring these time delays , depending on the timescale one wants to probe and the type of time signal available .    in this section",
    "we describe the two different techniques implemented here for measuring time lags : the fourier technique and the maximum - likelihood technique .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ is in an elliptical orbit with a 48-hour orbital period .",
    "this gives long , uninterrupted exposures , which are ideal for the traditional fourier techniques , where the lowest frequency probed is the orbital frequency ( 1/orbital period ) .",
    "this technique is not possible with _ nustar _ because the telescope is on a low earth orbit , with an orbital period of @xmath5 minutes .",
    "for agn , we typically want to probe frequencies lower than the",
    "_ nustar _ orbital frequency , and therefore we employ the maximum - likelihood technique , which accounts for the orbital gaps in the data .      for the fourier technique ,",
    "we follow the methodology outlined in @xcite , and explained further in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we produce light curves in different energy bands in 10  s bins .",
    "we take the discrete fourier transform of each light curve , which can be expressed in its phasor form as the product of its amplitude and complex exponential phase . taking",
    "the complex conjugate reverses the sign of the phase . to calculate the phase difference between two light curves , we multiply the fourier transform of one light curve by the complex conjugate of the fourier transform of another",
    "this product is known as the cross spectrum , and its phase is simply the phase difference between the two light curves .",
    "the cross spectrum is averaged in frequency bins , and this frequency - dependent phase can be converted into a frequency - dependent time lag by dividing by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the middle - frequency of the logarithmic bin . throughout this paper , a positive lag",
    "is defined such that the hard band light curve is delayed with respect to the soft band .",
    "the 1-@xmath8 errors are determined following equation 16 of @xcite , and are based on the number of frequency bins sampled and the coherence between the light curves .",
    "the maximum - likelihood technique for parametric model fitting by estimating the covariance matrix has been discussed in several works @xcite .",
    "it was applied to parameter estimation for sparse 2d power spectra of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and then later to x - ray light curves in @xcite .",
    "the technique was developed by @xcite for the application of measuring x - ray time lags , and has been shown through monte carlo simulations to give the same results as the standard fourier techniques .",
    "the method fits for the most likely variability powers and time lags given the observed data .",
    "the technique relies on the fact that the autocorrelation is the fourier transform of the power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "if we model the psd as a step function ( parameterized by the power in each pre - defined frequency bin ) , then we can compute the maximum likelihood between the observed autocorrelation and the model psd parameters .",
    "analogously , the cross correlation is the fourier transform of the cross spectrum , and in this case the model parameters that we compute are the amplitude and phase of the cross spectrum .",
    "similar to the standard fourier techniques , that phase lag is then converted into a time lag by dividing by @xmath6 .",
    "the errors presented are computed by stepping through the parameters in the likelihood function and taking the 68% uncertainty as the value that changes @xmath9log(@xmath10 ) by 1 @xcite .    as the autocorrelation and",
    "cross correlation matrices can be computed with unevenly sampled light curves , this technique is the best way to find the low - frequency time lags in light curves from telescopes in a low earth orbit , such as _ suzaku _ and _",
    "nustar_. for these telescopes , we are in the regime where the light curves have a constant time bin width , but there are gaps of missing data due to earth occultation .",
    "we direct the reader to @xcite and appendix  a in this paper for more details on the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "we presented the first discovery of reverberation lags in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 in @xcite , using these _ xmm - newton _ observations . in that paper",
    ", we looked at the lag - frequency spectra between the soft ( 0.31  kev ) and mid ( 15  kev ) bands , and found that the mid - band lags the soft band at frequencies below @xmath11  hz .",
    "considering the lag - frequency spectrum between the 35  kev and 58  kev bands revealed a further high frequency , hard band lag at frequencies below @xmath12  hz .",
    "we used these lag - frequency spectra to decide which frequencies to probe for the lag - energy spectra .",
    "we direct the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the lag - frequency spectrum , and we simply highlight here some of the main reverberation results to compare with the higher energy _ nustar",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ lag - energy spectra are both computed by measuring the lag in each energy channel of interest with respect to a broad reference band . the reference band is chosen to be the entire energy band ( 0.310  kev for _ xmm - newton _ and 350  kev for _ nustar _ ) , with the channel of interest removed so that the noise is not correlated .",
    "this choice of reference band does not affect the relative shape of the lag - energy spectrum ( see appendix  b for more details ) .",
    "the lag is read from bottom to top , i.e. the smaller the lag , the earlier the signal arrived at the detector .",
    "it is important to note that the meaningful quantity is the relative lags between energy bins .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ lag - energy spectrum on the left shows little or no lag between energies from 0.35  kev , but above 5  kev the emission is delayed by @xmath13  s. in @xcite , we interpreted this sharp increase at @xmath14  kev as the reverberation lag from a relativistically broadened fe  k emission line .",
    "what is particularly interesting about this result is that swift  j2127.4 + 5654 has been suggested to have a spin of @xmath15 , using the iron line fitting method , implying that the isco is larger than for maximally spinning black holes .",
    "the reverberation result shows in a unique and model - independent way that the fe k line is not as broad in this source as in other sources where maximally spinning black holes have been inferred ( e.g. ngc  4151 , 1h0707 - 495 , iras  13224 - 3809 ; see fig",

    "there is little lag associated with the soft excess below 1  kev .",
    "the reflection fraction below 1  kev is low in this source , and therefore , we do not expect a bigger soft lag than what is observed .",
    "the panel of the right shows the corresponding lag using the _ nustar _ data at the same frequency .",
    "again we see the sharp increase at 57  kev that decreases above 7  kev .",
    "the fact that the _ xmm - newton _ lag - energy spectrum does not show the blue wing of the line may be because the 810  kev band is probing the lag associated with the compton hump , which is clear in the _ nustar _ lag - energy spectrum ( see the left panel of fig .  [ model ] for further comparison of the _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ lag - energy spectra ) .",
    "_ nustar _ allows us to now clearly determine the blue wing of the fe  k line above 7  kev . above 10  kev ,",
    "the lag increases again , at the energy of the compton hump .",

    "there is a noticeable increase in the lag at 7  kev , which also corresponds to the sharp decrease in the lag at high frequencies .",

    "ngc  1365 shows dramatic absorption variability between orbits .",

    "is measured to lag behind the zero - point continuum ( 45  kev ) by 500  s. the reflection fraction at the compton hump is around 50% , and the reflection fraction of the continuum band is around 10% .",
    "therefore , the measured lag of 500  s is about 40% of the intrinsic lag , i.e. 1250  s. the intrinsic reverberation lag is associated with the time it takes for the x - rays to travel from the source , to the disc , and then up to the same height as the source . for simplicity ,",
    "if we assume a face on disc for these seyfert galaxies , then the height of the source above the disc is half of the intrinsic lag , or 625 light seconds , in the case of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "we can use black hole mass estimates from the literature to convert this coronal height into gravitational radii ( e.g. a 10  s light travel time for a @xmath22 black hole corresponds to a distance of 1  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the black hole mass in swift j2127.4 + 5654 is @xmath24 @xcite , which puts the corona at @xmath25 above the disc .",
    "this source height is larger than the average source height of 4  @xmath23 found by fitting a sample of lag - frequency spectra @xcite , but perhaps that is not surprising given that swift  j2127.4 + 5654 has a measured intermediate spin , while many in that sample are measured to have maximally spinning black holes .    for ngc  1365 , the compton hump ( 3050  kev )",
    "is measured to lag behind the zero - point continuum ( 34  kev ) by @xmath26  s. the reflection fraction is around 60% at the compton hump , and 20% for the continuum band , which puts the intrinsic lag at 1500  s , and a coronal source height at half that light travel distance , 750 light seconds .",
    "the black hole mass for this source is tentative , and mass estimates have ranged from @xmath27 @xcite to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the large amplitude and low - frequency of the fe  k lag support the higher black hole mass estimate for this source . using the result from @xcite that the average source height is @xmath29 , the black hole mass",
    "would then be @xmath30 .",
    "at these small distances close to the black hole , the shapiro delay will likely be an important effect , but for this simple calculation , we do not include it here ( for more on the lags due to the shapiro delay , see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* for more on fitting the lag - frequency spectrum with general relativistic ray tracing models to obtain a consistent estimate of the black hole mass ) .",
    "@xcite recently argued that a spin measurements can only clearly be made when the source height is small , less than around @xmath0 .",
    "our lag results confirm a small source height , which gives us additional confidence in the spectral line - fitting results .",
    "the large amplitude low - frequency lags have often been observed in variable agn @xcite .",
    "the origin of the hard lag is still not well understood . in the prevailing phenomenological model of @xcite , which we refer to as the ` propagation ' model ,",
    "perturbations are introduced in the accretion flow at a broad range of radii .",
    "these perturbations propagate inwards on the diffusion timescale .",
    "this is a multiplicative effect , causing variability at very large radii to correlate with the variability at small radii .",
    "these perturbations can modulate the x - ray emitting region , and if the emissivity of the soft emission extends to larger radii than the hard emission , this will naturally cause the hard photons to lag behind the soft . as",
    "this is a multiplicative effect , the perturbations from large radii do _ not _ imply that the x - ray source extends out to those large radii , and the corona can still be contained within a few gravitational radii of the central black hole .",
    "the low - frequency lags have been shown to exhibit a featureless increase with energy in both x - ray binaries @xcite and in agn , however , in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 , we find some structure in its lag - energy spectrum at around 7  kev ( fig .",
    "[ 2127_low_lagen ] ) . at high - frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ 2127_high_lagen ] ) there is a clear dip at  7  kev , and so it is possible that the dip in the high - frequency lags is corresponds to the increase in the low - frequency lag at 7  kev .",
    "in other words , we are seeing contamination in the low - frequency lags from the high - frequency lags .",
    "this has been seen before , in 1h0707 - 495 , where a sharp increase in the low - frequency lag occurs at the same energy ( 1  kev ) as a dip in the high - frequency lag - energy spectrum @xcite .",

    "the third orbit of ngc  1365 shows a low - frequency soft lag ( fig .",
    "[ 1365_low_lagen ] ) .",
    "this is different than the low - frequency lags found in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 or any other agn yet studied , where we typically find a low - frequency hard lag",
    ". we can understand this low - frequency soft lag in terms of a change of column density in the neutral reflector during the observation . using principal component analysis",
    ", @xcite has recently shown that for ngc  1365 , absorption can explain much of the variability below 3  kev at long timescales .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that in the third orbit ( where we see this low - frequency soft lag ) , the column density is decreasing with time .",
    "physically , this can be understood as an eclipsing cloud that is moving out of our line of sight , so the nuclear region is becoming less obscured .",
    "the hard photons can travel further through the high column material , and so at first , when the source is obscured , only the hard photons are able to penetrate the cloud . as the cloud moves out of our line of sight",
    ", we are able to see also the soft photons .",
    "therefore this low - frequency lag is associated with a _ change _ in the column density .",
    "the amplitude of the lag will depend on how fast the eclipsing cloud is moving ( i.e. the rate at which the column density decreases ) .",
    "we test this hypothesis through a simple model , shown in fig .  [ absorbs ] .",
    "in the top left panel , we show the results from fits to the photon spectrum in @xcite , where the column density of the neutral absorber systematically decreases during the third orbit .",
    "the top right panel shows what the absorbed spectrum looks like at each of those times . for simplicity ,",
    "we have used an absorbed powerlaw with changing column density .",
    "we start with light curves that have zero intrinsic lag between different energy bins .",
    "the middle - left figure shows simple sinusoid light curves at 1  kev and 10  kev .",
    "we then evolve the flux of the light curves in time , as the column density decreases .",
    "the middle - right figure shows the resulting light curves , and it is clear that the flux of the 10  kev light curve begins to increase before the 1  kev light curve ( because the soft photons are most affected by the neutral absorber ) .",
    "the bottom - left figure shows the lag vs. frequency between the 1  kev and 10  kev light curves , which shows the soft band lagging at low frequencies .",
    "finally , e calculate the lag - energy spectrum ( bottom - right ) at the frequency range @xmath32 \\times 10^{-5}$ ]  hz , just as for the observed low - frequency lag - energy spectrum .",
    "the amplitude of the lag in this simple model is similar to what we find in the data .",
    "we note that in this model we do not account for dilution from propagation lags ( which likely exist ) .",
    "this will cause the observed amplitude of the lag to decrease .",
    "this effect could account for the slight difference that we find between our simple model and the data .",
    "this model predicts a constant lag above 10  kev because the absorption does not affect the higher energies .",
    "the low - frequency soft lag in orbit 3 is a transient phenomenon , not present in all orbits , which is consistent with the eclipsing cloud interpretation .",
    "orbit 1 shows low variability power and coherence , but there is a slight negative lag at the highest energies , as in orbit 3 .",
    "the column density varies throughout the observation , though the general trend is a decrease @xcite .",
    "orbit 2 has a constant column density throughout the observation , and so there would be no lag due to absorption changes in this source .",
    "we find a low - frequency hard lag , similar to other seyfert galaxies , including swift  j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "the hard lag in the second orbit may be associated with the propagation lag . the column density in orbit 4 increases throughout the observation , opposite to orbit 3 .",
    "therefore , we would expect the lag to increase due to the increase in column density in this observation .",
    "the data quality is poor in this orbit , though the lag - energy spectrum does have a positive slope .",
    "we have presented the lag analysis of the joint _ xmm - nustar _ observations of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 .",
    "our main findings are :    1 .",
    "swift j2127.4 + 5654 , with an intermediate spin black hole , shows a narrower fe k lag than sources with maximally spinning black hole , and also shows a clear lag associated with the compton hump .",
    "2 .   the amplitude of the iron k lag and the compton hump lag in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 are consistent with each other , and can be well described by a light travel time of 1000  s between the corona and the accretion disc .",
    "3 .   ngc  1365 has a very clear iron k lag in the least absorbed _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the lag above 10  kev appears to increase at the energy of the compton hump , though the lags are not very well constrained .",
    "4 .   at low frequencies ,",
    "ngc  1365 does not show a featureless hard lag , rather there appears to be a soft lag at the _ xmm - newton _ band .",
    "this can be understood as the effect of an eclipsing cloud that moves out of our light of sight during the observation , thus decreasing the column density , which causes the hard photons to respond before the soft at these long timescales .",
    "mcg-5 - 23 - 16 @xcite , swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 are the first sources to be analysed for their high - frequency lags in the _ nustar _ band .",
    "there is clear evidence for the fe k lag and associated compton hump lag in the high - frequency lag - energy spectra , especially in swift j2127.4 + 5654 .",
    "the iron k and now the compton hump lag measurements are completely independent of spectral modelling , and are strong confirmation of relativistic reflection off an ionised accretion disc .",

    "while this example is for the psd , the same procedure applies for measuring the time lags ; instead of computing the autocorrelation in one light curve , we compute the cross correlation matrix between two light curves in different energy bands .",
    "the fourier transform of the cross correlation matrix gives us the cross spectrum , consisting of an amplitude and phase difference .",
    "the basic principal is that we start with one unevenly sampled _",

    "we are in the regime where we use uniform time bins of width @xmath36 , but we are periodically missing data due to the orbital gaps . while these gaps prohibit us from using the standard fourier techniques for timescales longer than each orbital period , we can take the autocorrelation of the entire light curve @xmath33 .",
    "we compare this autocorrelation to a model correlation matrix @xmath37 , with dimensions @xmath38 .",
    "once we have a model correlation matrix that is a good description of the data , we use the relation that the autocorrelation is the fourier transform of the power spectrum to obtain an estimate for the power spectrum .    in practice , we start with an initial model of the power spectrum .",

    "this is the best approach when the intrinsic shape of the psd or cross spectrum is unknown ( which is the case for the cross spectrum ) .",
    "then we take the fourier transform of our initial model psd to convert it into the model correlation matrix . the power in our psd",
    "is set to zero below the lowest frequency , @xmath40 , so that the integration of the power spectrum converges .",
    "we then correct for this bias by adding additional low - frequency power that is estimated from monte carlo simulations .",
    "we maximize the model parameters @xmath39 by constructing a likelihood function between the model correlation matrix and our light curve @xmath33 ( eq .  5 in * ? ? ?",

    "the maximum likelihood is computed from a psd with 3 equally space logarithmic frequency bins from @xmath41 up to @xmath42 , around the nyquist frequency , @xmath43 , where @xmath36 is the width of our time bins ( 512  s for this case ) .",
    "we chose the lower frequency limit to be just below @xmath40 to account for red noise leakage due to the finite size of the observation .",
    "this corrects for the bias at low frequencies . at high frequency",
    ", the bias is due to aliasing above @xmath44 . @xcite and others note that for unevenly sampled light curves the aliasing effect does not necessarily begin at the nyquist frequency because @xmath36 is not constant . in our case , where our sampling is largely uniform , just with missing data due to the orbital gaps",

    "we compute the errors by stepping through the parameters and taking the 68% uncertainty as the value that changes @xmath9log(@xmath10 ) by 1 or similarly , by using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to map the full probability space for each parameter directly ( which is computationally more expensive ) . for our example",
    ", it took 62 minutes on a single intel(r ) core with 3.4 ghz processor to map the full probability space .",

    "in fig .  [ model ] , we overplot the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ lags for swift  j2127.4 + 5654 and ngc  1365 . the reference band used to calculate the lags from these two datasets are different ( 0.310  kev for _ xmm - newton _ and 350  kev for _ nustar _ ) .",
    "we show here , that this only results in a change in the normalization of the lag , and so we can compare the two by simply scaling the lag - energy spectra by some constant . the relative lag between energy bins is the relevant value , and this remains the same for any coherent reference band .",
    "this result has been tested through simulations , and discussed in @xcite , and we demonstrate this point further here .",
    "we construct a simple demonstration in fig .",

    "the lag - energy spectra shown here are the result of interpolation between twenty equally spaced logarithmic bins from 0.350  kev .",
    "we computed 1000 monte carlo light curves in each bin using the method of @xcite . to reduce scatter for the figure",
    ", the light curves do not include poisson noise , but the overall result is the same including poisson noise .",
    "each light curve contains some primary emission and some reflected emission , imposed by the fraction of each component in the mean spectrum from @xcite .",
    "the reflected emission was delayed by 1250  s ( the value calculated for the intrinsic lag in section  [ highfreq ] ) .",
    "we assume unity coherence between the primary and reflected components , as suggested by the high level of coherence in the data .",
    "if there is some additional variable , but non - coherent component in the reference bands , this will cause the shapes of the lag - energy spectra to be different , but we find no evidence of that in these sources ( e.g. the right panel of fig .",
    "[ xmm_lag_freq ] ) .",
    "[ ref ] shows what the lag - energy spectra look like for different reference bands .",
    "the solid black line shows the lag - energy spectrum using the entire 0.350  kev band , and the blue dashed and red dotted lines show the lag - energy spectra for the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ reference bands , respectively",
    ". the shape of the lag - energy spectrum does not change ( it follows the reflection fraction , as shown in fig .  [ model ] ) , yet the normalization is different .",
    "the difference between the lag - energy spectra with _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ is @xmath46  s. the observed difference between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _ lag - energy spectra is also 270  s. this gives us confidence that we are observing the same features in the lags when comparing the two datasets ."
