    "<S> this bound is finally improved considering the equi - independence number of @xmath10 , which is a concept introduced in this paper for bipartite graphs .    * keywords * : hypercube ; hamiltonian cycles ; @xmath2-th dimension edges ; equi - independence number ; inscribed square conjecture ; bipartite graphs . </S>"
