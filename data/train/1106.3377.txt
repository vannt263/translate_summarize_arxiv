    "quantum many - body states , which have long been the central research objects in condensed matter physics and statistical physics , are now attracting the renewed interest in quantum information science .",
    "in particular , in measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite , the role of quantum many - body states played in quantum computation is very clear : once the special resource state , which is called the cluster state , is prepared , universal quantum computation is possible with adaptive local measurements on each qubit . this clear separation between the resource preparation and the execution of computation itself has also relaxed the requirements for experimental realization of quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of quantum computational tensor network ( qctn ) , which is a novel framework of mbqc on general many - body states , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the most innovative feature of this framework is that the resource state is represented in the matrix - product ( or tensor - product ) form  @xcite and universal quantum computation is simulated in the virtual linear space , which is called the correlation space ( cs )  @xcite , where matrices ( or tensors ) live .",
    "how does the behavior of a physical quantity in a many - body resource state affect the computational power of a quantum computer ? if one wants to construct a bridge between quantum many - body physics and quantum information science",
    ", one can not avoid tackling such a question .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the beautiful result was obtained that if a many - body resource state has too much entanglement , it is useless for mbqc . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a criterion of the amount of entanglement for universal preparators in graph states was obtained . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a relationship between the amount of entanglement and the gate fidelity in the one - way model was derived .",
    "these results have clarified important relationships between entanglement in many - body states and the computational power of mbqc .",
    "surprisingly , less attention has been paid to relationships between more traditional physical quantities , namely , a two - point correlation and the computational power of a quantum computer .",
    "obviously , a two - point correlation is one of the most important research subjects in traditional quantum many - body physics , such as condensed matter physics and statistical physics .",
    "if we consider applications of quantum many - body states in condensed matter physics to quantum computation @xcite , it is natural to ask how the behavior of a two - point correlation affects the computational power of a quantum computer .",
    "it has long been known in quantum information science that two - point correlations exactly vanish within a finite distance in the cluster state .",
    "such a correlation property prohibits the cluster state from being the exact ground state of any physical hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the ground state of the affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki ( aklt ) model  @xcite , which exhibits the exponentially decaying two - point correlation , enables universal mbqc  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that we might be able to further explore other resource states in the pool of quantum many - body states including ones which exhibit polynomially decaying or non decaying two - point correlations .",
    "considering the fact that there are plenty of many - body states which exhibit such a long - range two - point correlation in condensed matter physics , it is very interesting to study whether we can use long - range - correlated many - body states as resources of mbqc .    in this paper , we investigate relationships between computational power and two - point correlations in qctn considering both finite and infinite - size resource states .",
    "specifically , we here address under what conditions we can simulate projective measurements and arbitrary single - qubit rotations in qctn , both of which are important properties of a universal resource for mbqc  @xcite .    we find that projective measurements are not simulated correctly in qctn on certain resource states of finite size , such as the aklt states with a specific boundary condition .",
    "we therefore introduce a class of finite - size matrix - product states ( mpss ) , namely , _",
    "normalizable _ resources , which allow correct projective measurements in the css . since",
    "two - point correlations exactly vanish within a finite distance in normalizable resources , they are considered as cluster like resources . in order to perform correct projective measurements on finite resource states with non vanishing two - point correlations",
    ", we introduce another class of mpss .",
    "we also mention an alternative way of simulating projective measurements indirectly by using the downloading method  @xcite .",
    "we further show that if a resource state can simulate arbitrary single - qubit rotations , it can also perform correct projective measurements in the infinite - size limit , that is , it is _ asymptotically normalizable_. accordingly , normalizability ( at least asymptotic sense ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a universal quantum computational wire , where both correct projective measurements and arbitrary single - qubit rotations can be simulated .",
    "this result is obtained by showing a theorem about convergence of a stochastic unitary map .",
    "furthermore , this theorem also tells us that a many - body state whose two - point correlation can not be upperbounded by an exponentially decaying function , such as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) , the ising antiferromagnetic , and the @xmath0 states , can not be used to perform an arbitrary single - qubit rotation .",
    "these findings highlight interesting relationships between computational power and correlation in many - body entangled states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "i , we briefly review qctn @xcite , which is the most general framework for mbqc . in sec .",
    "ii , we investigate simulations of projective measurements in the qctn framework and specify under what situation one can accurately simulate projective measurements in the resource states of finite size . in sec .",
    "iii , we extend the notion of normalizability to the resource states of infinite size , namely asymptotic normalizability , and address a fundamental relationship between asymptotic normalizability and computational power by providing a theorem which makes a bridge between the ability to perform an arbitrary single - qubit rotation and behavior of the two - point correlations .",
    "section iv is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "let us consider an mps @xcite : @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 ( @xmath3=@xmath4 ) are a @xmath5 matrix and @xmath6-dimensional boundary vectors @xcite , respectively , which live in the virtual hilbert space , the so - called _ correlation space _",

    "we here consider the case of @xmath16 , that is , the cs simulates a single qubit .",
    "we can simulate a quantum gate in the cs by performing a projective measurement in the basis @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) on a physical qudit .",
    "the postmeasurement state with the measurement outcome @xmath20 reads @xmath21 \\cdots a[i_2 ]   a [ \\alpha _ j ]   |l\\rangle    \\nonumber \\\\ & = &     \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 \\equiv \\sum _ { i=0}^{d-1 } \\alpha^ { * } _ { ji } a[i]$ ] and @xmath23/\\sqrt{a_j } |l\\rangle$ ] with @xmath24a [ \\alpha _ j ] $ ] .",
    "the postmeasurement state can be understood that the boundary vector @xmath25 is transformed to @xmath26 by the single - qubit operation @xmath22/\\sqrt{a_j}$ ] .",
    "so far , the normalization of an mps has not been considered properly . in order to address this point",
    ", we define the normalization factor as @xmath27 where @xmath28 \\rho a^{\\dag } [ i]$ ] .",
    "we denote the normalized mps as @xmath29 . in the normalizable resource with a finite @xmath30",
    ", projective measurements are simulated correctly at every position which is more than @xmath30 qudits away from the right boundary.,width=321 ]",
    "let us consider a situation where from the first to @xmath31th physical qudits are measured in order to implement a single - qubit rotation in the cs , and the boundary vector @xmath25 is transformed to @xmath32 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ] : @xmath33 then , we want to perform a projective measurement on the state @xmath34 in the cs in a basis @xmath35 .",
    "to this end , without loss of generality , the mps matrix @xmath11 $ ] can be written as @xmath36 & = & \\sqrt{c_m/2 } ( | \\phi _ 0 \\rangle \\langle 0|+| \\phi _ 1 \\rangle \\langle 1| ) \\\\",

    "if we do the measurement @xmath40 on the @xmath10th physical qudit and obtain the outcome @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , the probability @xmath43 of obtaining @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is calculated to be @xmath44 if the above operation properly simulates the projective measurement in the cs , @xmath45 must be satisfied .",
    "this leads to @xmath46 if a resource state does not satisfy condition ( [ cond ] ) , correct projective measurements are not simulated in the cs .      in order to perform correct qctn",
    ", we have to find mpss which satisfy condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "let us first consider a sufficient condition of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "we call a resource state _ normalizable _ , if there exists a natural number @xmath30 ( @xmath47 ) such that @xmath48 for all @xmath32 , @xmath49 and all @xmath50 .",
    "obviously normalizable resources satisfy condition ( [ cond ] ) as long as @xmath51 , which means that we can perform correct projective measurements in the cs at every position which is more than @xmath30 qudits away from the left boundary .",
    "later we will see that normalizability in the limit of @xmath52 is also a necessary condition for an arbitrary single - qubit rotation .",
    "a resource state is normalizable , if and only if the map @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is a completely depolarizing channel : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the pauli matrices ( @xmath57 ) , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are arbitrary unitary operators ( see appendix a ) . if a finite - size resource state ( @xmath60 ) is normalizable , @xmath30 is also finite",
    ". let us first consider the case of @xmath61 . in this case , @xmath62 , which means that the dimension of a physical system is at least @xmath63 , and in such a case the mps matrices are given by @xmath11= u\\sigma _ iv /2 $ ] .",
    "it is obvious that such a resource state with properly chosen @xmath58 and @xmath59 allows an arbitrary single - qubit rotation .",
    "next we consider the case of @xmath64 .",
    "the minimum dimension of a qudit which satisfies @xmath65 is @xmath66 , where the mps matrices are given , for example , by @xmath11 a[j ] = u \\sigma _ { i+2j } v$ ] ( @xmath67 ) . specifically ,",
    "if we choose @xmath58 and @xmath59 in such a way that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the mps matrices become @xmath72=h/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and @xmath73=hz/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , which is the matrices for the cluster state @xcite .",
    "since the above two- and four - dimensional resource states are normalizable with a finite @xmath30 , we can simulate correct projective measurements in the css even if their size is finite .",
    "the above definition of normalizability also has an important physical meaning : if a resource state is normalizable with a finite @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) , any two - point correlation @xmath75 vanishes for all @xmath76 ( see appendix b ) , where @xmath77 is an arbitrary operator on the @xmath10th qudit , and @xmath78 .",
    "thus the possibility of projective measurements in qctn with finite - size resource states is related to their vanishing two - point correlations . in the sense",
    "that two - point correlations exactly vanish with a finite distance , the normalizable resources with a finite @xmath30 can be viewed as cluster like resource states @xcite .",
    "then , it is natural to ask , can we simulate correct projective measurements on the resource states with non vanishing two - point correlations ?      in order to answer that question , we here find a class of finite - size mpss , which is not necessarily normalizable with a finite @xmath30 , but can satisfy condition ( [ cond ] ) with a finite @xmath30 by properly choosing the boundary condition @xmath49 .",
    "this class of mpss includes a wide variety of resource states , such as the aklt states with specific boundary conditions @xcite . as a canonical form of mpss in the class ,",
    "we take the matrices as @xmath36&=&\\sqrt{c_m/2 }   e^ { i \\theta _ 0   y } ,   a[1]=\\sqrt{c_m/2 }   e^{i \\theta _ 0 y } z , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a[j]&=&\\sqrt{c_j } e^{i \\theta _ j y } b_j   \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath15a[i]=i$ ] .",
    "we can easily show that this class of mpss with properly chosen @xmath82 is capable of performing an arbitrary single - qubit rotation .",
    "since @xmath11 $ ] consists of the pauli matrices and rotations about the @xmath83 axis , the map @xmath84 transforms the pauli matrices as follows @xmath85 where @xmath86 are some real numbers .",
    "using this fact and @xmath87 , we can conclude that the normalization factor takes the following form : @xmath88 with @xmath89 being some real numbers , which depend on @xmath90 and @xmath10 in general . then , if we choose @xmath91 , @xmath92 for all @xmath93 .",
    "that is , by choosing the boundary vector as @xmath94 , we can perform correct projective measurements at every position @xcite . instead of @xmath83 and @xmath95",
    ", we can also use other combinations of two pauli operators in the canonical form ( [ eq4 ] ) . specifically , if we set @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , the matrices become @xmath72= xz/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , @xmath73=x/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , and @xmath101= z /\\sqrt{3}$ ] , which is the aklt state @xcite ( we can also show that the aklt - like state @xcite is an mps of this class ) .",
    "we here explore another way to simulate projective measurements indirectly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a method has been proposed to download a quantum state from the cs to the physical space . in their method , we first project the @xmath10th qudit of @xmath102 to the subspace spanned by @xmath103 ( if we fail the projection , we repeat it again until it succeeds ) .",
    "next we rotate the state @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( @xmath42 ) via mbqc . then we now have @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and the factor @xmath108 comes from the measurements for the rotation @xmath109 in the cs .",
    "finally we perform the projective measurement @xmath110 on the @xmath111th qudit @xcite .",
    "the postmeasurement state corresponding to the measurement outcome @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is given by @xmath114 the coefficient of @xmath115 does not depend on @xmath116 , and hence we can download the state from the cs to the physical space , even if the resource state is of finite size .",
    "this means that mbqc on finite - size resource states is universal state preparator @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the above fact means that for finite - size resource states universal state preparator is more ubiquitous property than the simulator of a classical output . of course we can perform projective measurements indirectly on a quantum state in the cs by downloading it to the physical space and measuring the downloaded qudit . however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a faithful downloading process takes a time step in proportion to the correlation length of the resource state , which results in additional operations .",
    "since such additional operations can cause additional decoherence effects , it would be better to avoid doing download if we need only classical outputs .",
    "next we investigate a relationship between normalizability and possibility of an arbitrary single - qubit rotation by extending the notion of normalizability to the infinite - size resource states .",
    "we call a resource state _ asymptotically normalizable _ if it is normalizable only in the limit @xmath52 . for example , in the case of the aklt state @xcite , the matrices are given by @xmath72=x/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , @xmath73=xz/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , and @xmath117=z/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , and the normalization factor can be calculated to be @xmath118 where @xmath119 . in the limit @xmath52 , @xmath120 , and hence the aklt state is asymptotically normalizable .    to make a bridge between asymptotic normalizability and possibility of an arbitrary single - qubit rotation , in the following , we show a theorem about convergence of completely - positive - trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps , which allows a classification of the mpss of @xmath16 with respect to their behavior of two - point correlations .    _ theorem .",

    "this also suggests that a ground state near the critical point of a quantum phase transition can not be used as a resource state for mbqc , since two - point correlations of such a state decay as a polynomial function @xcite .",
    "evidence that computational power in mbqc is a robust property of a quantum phase has been demonstrated recently on the haldane phase @xcite .",
    "since a two - point correlation is a good witness of quantum phase transitions , the present result suggests that such a robust property should hold in other general models of quantum phase transitions .",
    "we have investigated relationships between computational power and two - point correlations in the resource states for qctn considering possibilities of projective measurements and arbitrary single - qubit rotations , both of which are important properties of a universal resource .",
    "our findings are as follows : ( i ) we have shown that the normalizable resources with a finite @xmath30 exhibit exactly vanishing two - point correlations with a finite distance like the cluster state , and always allow correct projective measurements in the cs although they are of finite size .",

    "accordingly , normalizability ( at least asymptotic sense ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a universal quantum computational wire which allows simulations of both correct projective measurements and arbitrary single - qubit rotations .",
    "( iv ) further , we have seen that a many - body state whose two - point correlations can not be upperbounded by an exponentially decaying function does not allow an arbitrary single - qubit rotation , since the matrices of such an mps can not be described as unitary operators . these results ( iii ) and",
    "( iv ) have been obtained by showing the theorem about convergence of a stochastic unitary map .",
    "this theorem itself seems to have an interesting meaning in the context of quantum channel .",
    "the detailed study is , however , out of our scope and an interesting topic for future work .",
    "let us finally mention the extension of the above results to tensor network states .",
    "since simultaneous single - qubit measurements are enough to readout results of quantum computation , we can apply the present argument for tensor network states by reducing them to mpss before the readout .",
