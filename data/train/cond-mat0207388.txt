    "based on early work of wigner @xcite , dyson @xcite proposed a classification of complex quantum systems according to their behavior under time reversal and spin rotations .",
    "the ergodic limits of the proposed symmetry classes are described by the gaussian orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic ensembles ( goe , gue , and gse ) of random - matrix theory .",
    "these were initially motivated by atomic nuclei and have since been applied successfully to a large variety of systems , most notably chaotic and disordered quantum systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , an additional seven symmetry classes have been identified @xcite , which are naturally realized in part by dirac fermions in random gauge fields ( chiral classes ) @xcite and in part by quasiparticles in disordered mesoscopic superconductors @xcite or superconducting - normalconducting ( sn ) hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "the common new feature of the new symmetry classes is a mirror symmetry in the spectrum : if @xmath0 is in the spectrum , so is @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding gaussian random - matrix ensembles differ from the wigner - dyson ensembles in so far as their spectral statistics , while still universal , is no longer stationary under shifts of the energy due to additional discrete symmetries .",
    "much insight into the range of validity of the wigner - dyson random - matrix ensembles has been gained from the semiclassical approach to the spectral statistics of chaotic quantum systems , based on gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite . in a seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "berry gave a semiclassical derivation of the spectral form factor of chaotic quantum systems for the wigner - dyson ensembles , partially reproducing the results of random - matrix theory and clarifying its limitations .",
    "in this paper we provide such a semiclassical interpretation , based on andreev systems , of a generalized form factor for the gaussian random - matrix ensembles associated with the new symmetry classes termed @xmath2 and @xmath2i ( the pertinent gaussian ensembles will be referred to as @xmath2-ge and @xmath2i - ge )",
    ".    there have been several attempts to apply semiclassical theory to sn hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the gap induced by the proximity effect in a billiard coupled to a superconducting lead ( andreev billiard  cf .",
    "1b ) is sensitive to whether the classical dynamics of the ( normal ) billiard is integrable or chaotic .",
    "these authors showed that the proximity - induced hard gap in the chaotic case is _ not _ fully reproduced by semiclassical theory , the reasons for which have been discussed further in ref .",
    "all these systems have in common that due to the presence of the superconductor the combined electron - hole dynamics is no longer chaotic even if the corresponding normal ( nonsuperconducting ) billiard is chaotic @xcite . by contrast , we focus here on a semiclassical approach to sn hybrid systems where the combined electron - hole dynamics remains chaotic even in the presence of the superconductor .",
    "such systems exhibit the _ universal _ spectral statistics of the gaussian random - matrix ensembles for the new symmetry classes .",
    "we identify the class of periodic orbits contributing to universal features in the density of states near the fermi energy and show that in this case , semiclassics reproduces the spectral statistics predicted by random - matrix theory .",
    "we briefly summarize the pertinent random - matrix results for the gaussian ensembles corresponding to the new symmetry classes . for the wigner - dyson ensembles ( gue , goe , gse ) , the average density of states is nonuniversal and random - matrix theory makes universal predictions only about spectral fluctuations in the ergodic limit such as the correlation function @xmath3 of the deviations @xmath4 of the density of states @xmath5 from its mean value @xmath6 .",
    "a central quantity is the spectral form factor @xmath7 the ergodic limit of the new symmetry classes differs from the wigner - dyson case by the fact that even the average density of states has universal features close to the fermi energy @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in this case , we define a generalized spectral form factor by the fourier transform of the expectation value of the ( oscillating part of the ) density of states : @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the energy ( measured relative to @xmath8 ) . for the ensemble @xmath2-ge ( class @xmath2 is invariant under spin rotations , while time reversal is broken )",
    ", this form factor is @xcite @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the heisenberg time defined in terms of the mean density of states @xmath12 sufficiently far from the fermi energy ( the oscillating part of the density of states is defined as @xmath13 ) .",
    "semiclassically @xmath12 corresponds to weyl s law . for the ensemble @xmath2i - ge ( class @xmath2i differs from @xmath2 by invariance under time - reversal ) ,",
    "the short - time expansion is @xcite @xmath14 wigner - dyson statistics can be applied even to a single chaotic system by exploiting a spectral average . by contrast , the new symmetry classes require an ensemble average since they have universal features in the vicinity of special energies ( fermi energy @xmath8 ) . for billiards one may average over shapes .    before entering into the semiclassical analysis for the new symmetry classes , we briefly review the semiclassical derivation of the usual spectral form factor of the gue .",
    "there one starts from the gutzwiller trace formula , that relates the oscillatory contribution @xmath4 to the density of states to a sum over periodic orbits @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 here , @xmath17 denotes the classical action of the orbit , @xmath18 denotes its stability amplitude , and @xmath19 is the primitive orbit traversal time .",
    "the explicit factor @xmath19 arises because the traversal of the periodic orbit can start anywhere along the orbit . inserting this expression into the definition of the spectral form factor , and employing the diagonal approximation",
    ", one finds @xmath20 finally averaging over some time interval @xmath21 and using the hannay  ozorio - de - almeida sum rule @xcite @xmath22 } |a_p|^2 = \\delta t / t$ ] one obtains the result @xmath23 valid for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the period of the shortest periodic orbit .",
    "this result agrees with the short - time behavior of the spectral form factor predicted by the gue .",
    "we now turn to andreev billiards  the central theme of this paper .",
    "the novel element in sn hybrid systems is andreev reflection converting electrons into holes ( and vice versa ) at the interface to the superconductor ( see fig .",
    "1a ) . in this process",
    ", the incoming electron ( hole ) acquires a phase @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter @xmath29 @xcite . in the absence of a magnetic field , electrons ( holes ) sufficiently close to the fermi energy ( @xmath30 )",
    "are reflected as holes ( electrons ) which then retrace the electron ( hole ) trajectory backwards ( retroflection ) . in chaotic billiards , essentially all trajectories",
    "eventually hit any given part of the boundary .",
    "thus , if the billiard is then coupled to a superconductor any quasiparticle eventually hits the superconducting interface , leading to a periodic orbit bouncing back and forth between two points on the superconducting interface .",
    "it follows that a conventional chaotic billiard ( without magnetic field ) that is coupled to a superconductor has a combined electron - hole dynamics that is no longer chaotic . instead",
    ", the resulting trajectories are all periodic , leading to nonuniversal behavior such as the proximity - induced hard gap @xcite for time - reversal invariant systems .",
    "one expects to recover universal spectral statistics _ only _ if the _ combined _ electron - hole dynamics is chaotic and periodic orbits are isolated as in conventional chaotic ( hyperbolic ) systems . in andreev billiards",
    "this occurs naturally when time - reversal symmetry is broken by a perpendicular magnetic field ( symmetry class @xmath2 ) . in this case",
    "the retroflected hole ( electron ) does not retrace the trajectory of the incoming electron ( hole ) , as electron and hole trajectories are curved in the same direction ( cf .",
    "this allows one to express the density of states semiclassically by a gutzwiller - type trace formula as a sum over the isolated periodic orbits of the _ combined _ electron - hole dynamics of the andreev billiard , @xmath31 the orbit amplitudes @xmath18 are products of electron and hole contributions , @xmath32 while the orbit actions are sums of electron and hole actions , @xmath33 the factor @xmath19 again reflects the arbitrary starting point of the orbit and @xmath34 denotes the accumulated andreev phases .",
    "coherent contributions to the form factor can be expected from the periodic orbits that retrace the same trajectory in the same direction with the roles of electrons and holes interchanged .",
    "self - dual _ orbits are invariant under electron - hole conjugation and the dynamical contributions to their action largely cancel due to the relation @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 . moreover , the amplitudes of electron and hole are just complex conjugates of one another , giving @xmath37 .",
    "the accumulated andreev phase is @xmath38 with @xmath39 an odd integer . keeping only the self - dual periodic orbits ",
    "the _ self - dual approximation _  we find @xmath40 for the generalized form factor , this leads to @xmath41 this expression reveals the similarity to the diagonal approximation for the wigner - dyson form factors .",
    "however , only _",
    "one _ factor @xmath19 arises .",
    "the hannay  ozorio - de - almeida sum rule does not apply directly to the sum over self - dual orbits ( being a sum over amplitudes of a subclass of periodic orbits ) . to deal with this difficulty ,",
    "we introduce a _ virtual billiard _ with the same dynamics as the andreev billiard except that there is _ no _ particle - hole conversion at the sn interface .",
    "thus , the virtual billiard is an ordinary chaotic billiard with unusual reflection conditions at the sn interface ( retroflections ) .",
    "primitive periodic orbits of the virtual billiard involve either even or odd numbers of retroflections . reintroducing electron - hole conversion",
    ", one observes that even orbits lead to non - self - dual periodic orbits in the andreev billiard .",
    "by contrast , twofold traversals of odd orbits are periodic and self dual in the andreev billiard as the roles of electron and hole are interchanged in the second traversal ( see fig .  1b )",
    ". we can now interpret the sum over self - dual orbits in eq.([sd ] ) as a sum over odd orbits of the virtual billiard . since on average half of its orbits",
    "are odd , the hannay  ozorio - de - almeida sum rule for the virtual billiard gives @xmath42 } |a^{(e)}_p|^2 = \\frac{\\delta      t}{2t}.\\ ] ] thus @xmath43 in agreement with the random - matrix result predicted by @xmath2-ge ( [ rmt - result ] ) for short times .",
    "the self - dual approximation is expected to hold for @xmath44 where @xmath25 is the traversal time of the shortest periodic orbit and @xmath45 the andreev time ( typical time until electron - hole conversion takes place ) .",
    "the semiclassical calculation of the form factor becomes particularly transparent and explicit for quantum graphs which were recently introduced @xcite as simple quantum chaotic systems . introducing andreev reflection as a new ingredient",
    ", we show _ semiclassically _ that the form factor of the resulting _ andreev graph _ takes on the universal result .",
    "a quantum graph consists of vertices connected by bonds .",
    "a particle ( electron / hole ) propagates freely on a bond and is scattered at a vertex according to a prescribed scattering matrix . for definiteness",
    ", we discuss star graphs with @xmath46 bonds of equal length @xmath47 . these have one _ central _ vertex and @xmath46 _ peripheral _ vertices .",
    "each bond connects the central vertex to one peripheral vertex ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "andreev ( star ) graphs are obtained by introducing ( complete ) electron - hole conversions at the peripheral vertices , while the central vertex preserves the particle type .",
    "the quantization condition is @xmath48 with the unitary @xmath49 matrix @xmath50 here @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the central scattering matrix for an electron ( hole ) .",
    "for definiteness , we choose @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath51 by itself does not break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the matrix @xmath54 contains the phases accumulated when the quasiparticle propagates along the bonds ( @xmath55 is the wave number measured from the fermi wave number ) .",
    "finally , @xmath56 contains the _ andreev phases _ accumulated at the vertices , where @xmath57 denotes the order - parameter phase at peripheral vertex @xmath58 .",
    "time - reversal symmetry is obeyed if all andreev phases are either @xmath59 or @xmath60 , but is broken otherwise .",
    "accordingly , we build ensembles corresponding to the symmetry classes @xmath2 ( uncorrelated andreev phases @xmath57 with uniform distributions in the interval @xmath61 ) and @xmath2i ( uncorrelated andreev phases taking values @xmath59 or @xmath62 with equal probability ) . numerically computed ensemble averages are in excellent agreement with random - matrix results from @xmath2-ge and @xmath2i - ge , as shown in fig .  3 .

    "as the phase factors due to scattering between bonds @xmath58 and @xmath86 for electrons and holes are complex conjugates of one another , this requires that the periodic orbits contain equal numbers of scatterings from @xmath58 to @xmath86 as electron and hole .",
    "this leads to the orbits sketched in fig .  4 :",
    "an _ odd _ number of peripheral vertices are visited twice , once as an electron and once as a hole .",
    "first , the peripheral vertices are visited once , alternating between electrons and holes , and subsequently the vertices are visited again in the same order but with the roles of electrons and holes interchanged .",
    "thus , these orbits have the same structure as the self - dual orbits discussed above for the andreev billiard .",
    "we have @xmath76 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the number of such orbits of length @xmath83 is @xmath89 , where the denominator @xmath85 reflects the identification of cyclic permutations of peripheral vertices . with these ingredients ,",
    "we find the short - time result @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the time - averaged form factor .",
    "this reproduces the result predicted by @xmath2-ge .    for class @xmath2i ,",
    "the average over andreev phases requires only an even number of visits to each vertex . in the self - dual approximation ,",
    "this leads to additional orbits ( see fig .  4 ) and to the result @xmath92 the leading order term for short times predicted by the corresponding random - matrix ensemble @xmath2i - ge .",
    "finally , we come back to andreev billiards without magnetic field ( class @xmath2i ) . as explained above ( in section [ sec : billiards ] ) holes necessarily retrace the electron trajectory , thus leading to non - isolated periodic orbits and nonuniversal spectral statistics ( hard gap ) .",
    "universal spectral statistics of @xmath2i can , however , be found in such andreev billiards with @xmath46 one - channel leads .",
    "the reason for this is that andreev billiards with @xmath46 leads containing one channel each can be mapped to star graphs .",

    "the matrices @xmath97 describing the andreev scattering in the leads are diagonal , @xmath98 , with a specific andreev phase @xmath57 for each lead .",
    "time reversal invariance demands @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "then a detailed correspondence between billiard and star graph is obtained by substituting @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( with a more general central scattering matrix ) .",
    "thus , the form factor of these billiards can be obtained in the self - dual approximation in complete analogy with the star graph .",
    "we considered the universal spectral statistics for ergodic sn hybrid systems belonging to the new symmetry classes , in the semiclassical approximation . while it was known that semiclassics has problems in some types of andreev systems @xcite , we showed both for billiards and for quantum graphs that the universal spectral statistics of the random - matrix ensembles @xmath2-ge and @xmath2i - ge as reflected by the appropriately generalized form factor is correctly reproduced by semiclassical theory .",
    "an important condition for finding the universal spectral statistics is that the _ combined _ electron - hole dynamics of the andreev system is classically chaotic . in particular",
    ", this requires that the hole does not retrace the trajectory of the incoming electron . in class @xmath2 , this is naturally the case in magnetic andreev billiards .",
    "we related the universal features in the density of states to self - dual periodic orbits which are invariant under electron - hole exchange .",
    "our results clarify under which conditions to expect spectral statistics described by the novel random - matrix ensembles .    the results presented can be extended to the symmetry classes @xmath101,@xmath101iii and the chiral classes .",
    "we also note that our results for andreev graphs remain valid for a rather large class of central scattering matrices @xmath51 . finally , by going beyond the self - dual approximation in andreev graphs , it is possible to extract the orbits contributing to the form factor to linear order in @xmath102 ( weak localization corrections ) .",
    "these extensions will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the phase of the order parameter is not a gauge invariant quantity . for class ci , we assume @xmath103 with the gauge @xmath104 throughout this paper .",
