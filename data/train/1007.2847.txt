    "the identification and observational study of the earliest galaxies is crucial to our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve . with increasing cosmic age",
    ", increasingly complex physical processes can affect the properties of galaxies .",
    "consequently , it is hoped that the earlier a galaxy is observed , the more straightforward it will be to compare its properties to any theory of galaxy growth .",
    "whether or not this turns out to be true in practice , such galaxies can be used as markers of early structure formation and explored as candidate emitters of the radiation responsible for reionization .",
    "while several different techniques have been successfully used to identify galaxies at @xmath17 , the lyman break technique is arguably the most useful as it can provide a sample of objects with measurable properties for individual galaxies ( lyman @xmath5 line strength , continuum spectral energy distribution and potentially absorption line diagnostics of the sample or of individual objects if bright enough ) .",
    "optically - selected samples of high redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are dominated by systems that are undergoing strong and unobscured star formation because by @xmath0 optical observations probe the rest - frame spectral region shortward of 1800 , where emission is dominated by comparatively short - lived o and b stars .    in this decade",
    "there has been considerable progress in the observational identification of systems at these redshifts .",
    "this has allowed us to take the first steps towards understanding the properties of galaxies that most likely represent the earliest stages in the evolution of current - era massive galaxies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "thousands of candidate @xmath0 star forming lbgs have been identified in large - area ground - based photometric surveys , but only a very small fraction of these have been confirmed spectroscopically . while studies of optically - selected photometric samples can provide reliable insights into the properties of the sources when hst imaging is used on its own or in combination with deep infra - red photometry ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , deriving reliable conclusions from ground - based optically - selected samples is more problematic . not only do these samples suffer from the effects of contamination ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , but the information supplied on each system is minimal and so their detailed properties can not be explored .",
    "spectroscopically - confirmed samples of @xmath11 , while inevitably smaller than photometric samples , ultimately allow more detailed studies of the properties of the galaxies . with a reliable sample , uncertainties in statistical properties such as the luminosity function can be minimised .",
    "correlations between observables , such as line - strength and colour , start to unravel the evolution of the objects .",
    "instead of exploring the clustering by statistical methods in two dimensions ( which can be unreliable if the sample is contaminated ) , a direct determination of three - dimensional clustering can be made . with the stochastic and relatively short - lived nature of the star formation within these systems",
    ", the interpretation of clustering is potentially complicated given that the timescale over which a source may be uv - luminous can be only a small fraction of the look - back time through a survey volume .",
    "the most important benefit of a spectroscopically - confirmed sample is that it allows further spectroscopic follow - up in other wavebands ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so will eventually lead to a fuller understanding of the early stages of galaxy formation and evolution .    in order to furnish ourselves with a sample of objects with which to carry out such studies , we have carried out a spectroscopic survey of ten widely - separated @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 fields as part of the eso remote galaxy survey ( ergs ) , an eso large programme ( pi m. bremer , i d 175.a-0706 ) in order to identify and spectroscopically - confirm a sample of @xmath0 unobscured star - forming galaxies .",
    "we had several motivations for carrying out this spectroscopic survey .",
    "firstly , to explore the reliability of photometric samples and how they impact the reliability of statistical properties for @xmath0 lbgs , _",
    "e.g. _ their luminosity function ( see paper i ) . secondly , to obtain as large a sample of confirmed @xmath0 lbgs as possible in a reasonable amount of time ( the aim being at least 50 @xmath0 lbgs in 100 hours of 8 m spectroscopy ) .",
    "a sample of this size ( especially when combined with other published samples ) allows exploration of the properties of the sources and of any correlation between them .",
    "thirdly , by obtaining such a sample over multiple widely - separated pointings , 3-dimensional clustering can be explored directly , without being dominated by cosmic variance in any one field .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : observations ] we describe the data and sample selection of high redshift lbgs .",
    "details and examples of spectroscopic identification are given in section [ sec : specres ] .",
    "discussion of the global properties of the sample follows in subsequent sections .",
    "the @xmath11 redshift distribution is described in section [ sec : reddist ] .",
    "section [ sec : colours ] explores the rest - frame uv continuum of the lbgs and in section [ sec : ew ] the properties of the observed ly@xmath5 emission are discussed . in section [ sec : specmorph ] we describe the morphology of the confirmed high redshift lbgs .",
    "the surface density of sources is discussed in section [ sec : surface ] and the results of the @xmath18 lbg search are presented in section [ sec : z6 ] .",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath19cdm cosmology , i.e. a flat universe with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "all photometry was determined in the ab magnitude system @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic sample was derived from the same set of imaging data used to derive the photometric sample previously presented in paper i. the data included deep ( around two hours per band ) @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26-band imaging obtained with fors2 @xcite on the vlt and moderately - deep @xmath27 and @xmath28-band imaging ( 5 - 6 hours per band ) obtained with sofi on the ntt .",
    "the optical data covered approximately 49 arcmin@xmath2 in each field , while the near - ir data covered approximately half the area of the optical data per field .",
    "while the photometric sample reported in paper i was drawn from 286 arcmin@xmath2 requiring both optical and near - ir coverage , the spectroscopic candidates were drawn from an effective area of 440 arcmin@xmath2 , the area covered by the @xmath24 and @xmath25-band imaging after taking into account the area compromised by high surface brightness foreground objects .",
    "all imaging except the @xmath26-band frame were obtained as part of the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) , itself an eso large programme ( pi s. white , id:166.a-0162 , see * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath29-band imaging was obtained as part of ergs .",
    "although there was some field - to - field variation , typical @xmath30 limits in a 2@xmath31 circular aperture were @xmath32=28.1 , @xmath33=28.0 , @xmath34=27.1 , @xmath29=26.0 , @xmath35=24.5 , @xmath36=23.6 and seeing varied between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the optical bands , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath35 and @xmath40 and @xmath38 in @xmath36 , comparable to the quality and depth of other surveys of the equivalent or larger area .",
    "see paper i for a detailed field - to - field breakdown .      as for the photometric sample discussed in paper i",
    ", the primary selection criteria of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 were used to select objects that may have the characteristic spectral break of @xmath44 lbgs .",
    "the same sextractor @xcite catalogues were used to select objects for the photometric sample and spectroscopic targets .",
    "the photometric sample was generated using 2 arcsec diameter circular apertures so that photometry across all the bands ( with different pixel sizes ) could be combined in the object selection . while the photometric sample was defined to allow an accurate determination of completeness and contamination , one aim of the spectroscopy was to maximise the number of spectroscopic candidates to be targeted with the slit masks , thereby maximising the size of the spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath11 lbg sample .",
    "consequently , we performed the candidate selection twice using the same criteria with different photometric catalogues .",
    "the first catalogue used the aperture magnitudes from paper i and the second used total magnitudes measured using the sextractor mag_auto apertures defined in @xmath25 and with appropriate corrections to the @xmath23 and @xmath24-band value ( typically of a few hundredths of a magnitude due to the difference in seeing between the bands ) .",
    "if an object satisfied the primary selection criteria in either of the apertures , it was flagged as a candidate for spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , as we specifically wanted to both maximise the number of candidates placed on the spectroscopic masks and explore the potentially contaminating populations , we avoided an explicit @xmath45 colour cut to rule out potential lower redshift interlopers . in designing the observational strategy",
    ", we matched the number of masks to be used in any field to the number of objects selected by the primary selection criteria , ensuring that there were generally sufficient slits to observe objects with any @xmath45 colour .",
    "figure [ fig : targets ] shows the range of colours of the objects observed during the spectroscopy program .",
    "limits were used.,width=302 ]    even with several masks per field , pairs of candidates will compete for space because their positions are such that their dispersed spectra would overlap .",
    "consequently the candidates were prioritised drawing on our previous experience of comparable spectroscopy with the same instrumentation .",
    "we had previously observed four adjoining fors2 fields , searching for @xmath11 lbgs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* davies et al . in prep ) . as a result of this experience",
    "we were able to prioritise the candidates based on their likelihood of being at high redshift , as described below .",
    "this was done to maximise the number confirmed of @xmath0 lbgs on the masks .",
    "each candidate was categorised according to its photometry in all bands and if necessary from visual inspection of all of the ground - based images .",
    "if the object had @xmath46 , was undetected in the @xmath23 , @xmath27 and @xmath28-band images , and the photometry was in no way influenced by neighbouring objects ( affecting the background estimate or the positioning of the aperture ) , the object was believed to be at high redshift and given the highest priority ( noted as priority 1 in tables 1 and 2 ) . if the object was detected in the @xmath23-band , indicating that it may be a lower redshift galaxy or a star , or had potentially compromised photometry due to object overcrowding it was assigned a lower priority ( priority 2 in tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "sources which were detected in the near - infrared imaging , with colours inconsistent with high redshift star - forming galaxies were classified as likely ` low z ' objects . finally , in empty areas of the spectroscopic masks where no other strong candidates could be placed , objects with photometry outside the selection criteria ( _ e.g. _ objects with red @xmath47 colours but @xmath4826.3 , objects with @xmath49 , or objects detected in the @xmath23-band ) were observed , classified as ` other ' sources .",
    "this was particularly valuable as it probed additional colour space outside the selection . in practice ,",
    "sufficient objects were observed to obtain good statistics for each class despite slit contention .",
    "our previous experience had shown that brighter ( @xmath50 ) candidates were almost invariably low redshift galaxies ( @xmath51 ) or stars , especially if they had red @xmath45 or @xmath52 colours ( see paper i for details of the colour modelling of the contaminating populations ) . however , even in the cases where the multi - band characteristics of an object strongly indicated a low or zero - redshift , an object was not rejected from the list of candidates , merely given a lower priority .",
    "this was done so that the reliability of our selection , both for this sample and also for the photometric sample in paper i , could be determined . for objects with @xmath50 ,",
    "it is impossible to rule out with 100 per cent certainty an object being at high redshift based on the ground - based photometry alone ; all that can be determined is that an object is highly unlikely to be at high redshift .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath53 selected by our colour cuts would most likely have a strong agn component in order to be at @xmath0 . while our optical colours do not distinguish between a @xmath0 quasar and certain types of late - type stars , given that we detected only a single fainter object with a moderate agn component in our sample ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is likely that no brighter agn existed in the volume probed by the survey .",
    "as the near - ir data did not cover all of the optical fields , the full prioritisation could not be carried out uniformly across all areas .",
    "this resulted in less rigorous prioritisation in a fraction of each field .",
    "fortunately , objects which were near - ir detected and therefore less likely to be at the highest redshifts tended to be the brighter objects in the optical , or had red @xmath45 colours , both of which factors downgraded their priority on their own .",
    "thus a lack of near - ir data did not dramatically change the prioritisation of objects between the regions with and without near - ir data .",
    "as prioritisation was only important when there was contention between candidates for space on the slit masks , many candidates were observed regardless of their priority .",
    "table [ masks ] shows the fraction of high and low redshift targets which were observed .",
    "the results in table [ tab : expected ] ( discussed below ) confirm _ a posteriori _ that the prioritisation was effective .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : all ]    one possible explanation of the observed variation is the changing effective area of each field .",
    "however , with variations in area of less than 10% and no correlation with the density of candidates and confirmed lbgs suggests that this can not account for the differences .    alternatively , the presence of foreground clusters in each field ( the original subject of the majority of the imaging by the eso large program ediscs , @xcite ) could be distorting the source plane and affecting the probed volume @xcite . given the steep nature of the faint - end of the @xmath11 lbg luminosity function @xcite , the number density of candidates could increase significantly with the flux boosting effect of lensing . as the area of each field affected by strong lensing is small ,",
    "this is unlikely to be the cause of the observed number variation .",
    "there are also no objects observed with highly distorted or elongated morphologies , suggesting strong lensing in the deep images .",
    "although the effects of weak lensing cover a larger proportion of the field , the subsequent distortion effects are small and do not significantly alter the probed volume .",
    "there is also no correlation seen between the number of candidates and confirmed lbgs and the velocity dispersion , and hence mass , of the identified foreground clusters .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that the lensing effects of foreground structures are causing the observed differences in lbg surface densities .",
    "it is far more likely that these fields are probing truly overdense areas of the universe .",
    "the most compelling evidence for this is the variation from a smooth redshift distribution seen in the spectroscopic results of two of the individual fields and is discussed in the next section .",
    "out of the ten survey fields , two showed strong spectroscopic evidence of large scale structure . in fields j1040.7 - 1155 and j1054.7 - 1254",
    "there are clear spikes in the redshift distributions at @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , with six or more galaxies lying within a 0.1 redshift bin , which is equivalent to a co - moving distance of around 50mpc .",
    "the redshift distributions for these two fields are shown figures [ fig : red1040 ] and [ fig : red1054 ] for j1040.7 - 1155 and j1054 - 7.1245 respectively .",
    "the red dashed line indicates the distribution of grade a galaxies , the blue dotted line shows the distribution of all grade a and b galaxies , and the black line shows the night sky emission spectrum for the redshift of ly@xmath5 .",
    "the total redshift distribution of all confirmed galaxies predicts , at most , 1.3 galaxies per 0.1 redshift bin for an individual field .",
    "this field contains the third largest photometric sample of high redshift galaxy candidates out of the ten survey fields , with 25 candidates in the photometric sample ( paper i ) and 11 high redshift spectroscopic confirmations ( grade a and b ) .",
    "given the size of the photometric sample , a similarly high number of spectroscopic confirmations would be expected . in the redshift distribution",
    "there is a clear peak of objects between @xmath15 , a 6@xmath56 overdensity when compared to the spectroscopic statistics of the survey as a whole ( with the boundaries of the redshift bins tuned to give the largest peak ) .",
    "figure [ fig : red1040 ] shows this peak .",
    "only line emitters with redshift determinations accurate to within 300 - 400kms@xmath9 populate the redshift spike strengthening its identification as a real feature .",
    "it can not be explained as an artifact created by the uncertainty in a lyman break overlying skyline residual noise .",
    "figure [ fig : redxy1040 ] shows the spatial distribution of the galaxies in the redshift spike across the field . although the galaxies are spread across the field and are not concentrated in one region , it is still probable that they are part of the same structure .",
    "the closest pair of grade a galaxies in the field are 7.3mpc apart , with a furthest extent of 43.7mpc for the spectroscopically confirmed grade a members of the cluster , where the distances are co - moving in three dimensions .",
    "the co - moving dimensions of the surveys fields are typically 27 by 27mpc in the plane of the sky and probing a redshift interval of one , equivalent to 525mpc .",
    "is shown by the solid black line.,width=302 ]        the spectra of the galaxies constituting this redshift spike are typical of the line emitting sample as a whole .",
    "similarly , the morphologies and colours of the galaxies within the redshift spike are typical of the sample .",
    "this field contains the most photometric high redshift candidates ( 45 candidates in paper i ) , and was expected to produce the largest number of spectroscopic confirmations . within the spectroscopic identification of 24 high redshift galaxies ( grade a and b ) , there is significant spike at @xmath55 within @xmath57 , containing six times more galaxies than expected over such a redshift range ( grade a only ) , see figure [ fig : red1054 ] .",
    "the spike includes a close pair with a separation large enough to be individually spatially resolved in the spectrum .",
    "this pair was identified as a ly@xmath5 emitter and break - only galaxy as shown in figure [ fig : double ] .",
    "when both grades of spectroscopic confirmations of high redshift galaxies are included , this overdensity contains nine galaxies . if we include objects between @xmath58 and @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath59 , 17 grade a and b galaxies are included .",
    "however this redshift range is much larger than that expected for a cluster of galaxies or any other bound structure .",
    "the broad nature of this spike may suggest we are observing a filamentary structure end - on . again",
    "the overdensity is mainly determined by line emitters , a reflection of the greater fraction of line emitting galaxies confirmed compared to break - only galaxies in this field .     or 7kpc on the sky .",
    "the sky spectrum at this redshift is plotted below each spectrum and the location of ly@xmath5 at @xmath60 is shown.,width=302 ]     is shown by the solid black line.,width=302 ]    the galaxies in the redshift spike are spatially distributed over a smaller fraction of the field than those in j1040.7 - 1155 .",
    "they are clustered to one side of the @xmath61 arcminute field , as shown in figure [ fig : redxy105412 ] . the closest grade",
    "a galaxy pair has a co - moving separation of 670kpc ( excluding the very close pair ) , with the overdensity of galaxies covering 27mpc ( co - moving distance between furthest grade a confirmed galaxies in three dimensions ) .",
    "again , the spectra , colours and morphologies of the galaxies within the redshift spike are typical of the sample as a whole .",
    "as discussed above , two of the ten survey fields show evidence of large scale structure in the form of spikes in their redshift distributions .",
    "such overdensities could be a forming cluster , sheet or filament being probed in these fields . given that across the survey as a whole zero to one sources per 0.1 in redshift are expected , the identification of two fields with very clear overdensities of many times this expected number is highly significant .",
    "however , given the stochastic properties of lbgs @xcite , the nature of these overdensities is not immediately clear .    as the typical star - formation lifetime of high redshift lbgs is a few tens myrs ( assuming the majority of the galaxies within the overdensities are young , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the apparent coordination or synchronisation of these short - lived star - bursts over the entire field needs explanation .",
    "given the distances between the galaxies within the redshift overdensities , it is highly unlikely that these galaxies are dynamically bound or interacting sufficiently to have a common starformation trigger . assuming the young ages of these galaxies predicted by @xcite , @xmath6245myrs , it is likely that the galaxies have only travelled 50kpc , outside the hubble flow , in their lifetime ( assuming the galaxy is travelling at 1000kms@xmath9 ) .",
    "this suggests that if two galaxies are more than 100kpc apart , it is unlikely that they have interacted . with the closest pair of galaxies ( in field j1054.7 - 1245 )",
    "separated by 670kpc ( co - moving distance in three dimensions ) , the star formation observed can not be connected .",
    "this limited interaction region is reflected in the high resolution imaging of the hst data .",
    "it was found that many objects detected in the ground based data were in fact multiple systems , at most 16kpc apart and are subsequently close enough to potentially have star formation triggered by the mutual interaction .",
    "the apparent synchronisation of the relatively short - lived starbursts is likely to be an illusion for the above reasons .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the overdensity of objects undergoing a relatively short - lived phenomenon is that there is far more baryonic material in the large - scale structure that hosts these galaxies than is visible in the rest - frame uv . at any one time",
    "a small fraction of this material is visible as unobscured uv - bright starburst episodes lasting a few tens of myrs .",
    "if one were to wait a few tens of millions of years and re - observe the region , the large scale structure would still be marked out by an overdensity of uv - luminous starbursts , but probably different ones to those seen today .",
    "therefore , there is no synchronisation of the starbursts , just a high probability that several regions of the large - scale structure will be ` on ' at any one time .",
    "one way to try to detect this ` dark ' material connecting the observed systems , is to look for line or continuum emission , such as carbon or co emission lines , from gas within the structure , in the millimetre and submillimetre regimes .",
    "such an experiment was carried out in a 2 arcminute diameter region centred between two lbgs with concurrent redshifts in one of the overdense fields @xcite .",
    "although none of the optically identified lbgs were detected in the 37.7ghz band , a faint co(2 - 1 ) emission line was detected at the same redshift as the optically identified overdensity ( and subsequently reconfirmed in independent data , stanway et al .",
    ", in prep ) , shown in figure [ fig : redxy1040 ] . with no optical or near - infrared counterpart in the available imaging and a inferred molecular hydrogen gas mass of @xmath63m@xmath64 this line emitter is tracing previously undetectable baryonic mass .",
    "the assumption that there is a large reservoir of undetected material in the structures is consistent with the work of @xcite , which , through analysis of fossil populations in nearby galaxes , determined that massive galaxies found in high density environments formed the majority of their stars at @xmath65 .",
    "further support for such old star formation in massive galaxies is provided by the distant red galaxy ( drg ) population at @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite observed drgs which had uv to 8@xmath67 m spectral energy distributions fitted best by an old stellar population with very little current star formation . from the @xcite models used , they infer that the majority of the stellar mass was in place by @xmath11 or earlier ( depending on the metallicity assumed ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite report that the most massive systems seen today formed the majority of their stars at @xmath65 , from analysis of 30,000 galaxy spectra from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "@xcite also predict that a significant fraction of the mass at @xmath11 is not being observed in lyman break galaxy surveys .",
    "assuming that galaxies seen here at @xmath11 are mainly young , the typical stellar mass found by @xcite was a few @xmath68m@xmath64 .",
    "if this mass is applied to the galaxies in the redshift overdensities , and it is assumed that over time they will merge into one of the most massive systems today ( a best - case scenario to accumulate the most mass ) , the observed stellar mass at @xmath69 would only account for around 2% of the final baryonic mass of a massive galaxy at @xmath70 .",
    "although the structures may extend beyond the 44 arcmin@xmath2 field of view of the imaging or a fraction of the galaxies could be older and more massive than typical of the population , there is still large fraction of the mass unaccounted for .",
    "the apparent problem of starburst synchronisation can be avoided if the galaxies in the overdensities have older stellar populations with longer - lived starbursts than are typical of the population as a whole .",
    "although the majority of lbgs at @xmath11 studied by @xcite are young , a number of older , more massive systems were identified .",
    "similarly , individual relatively bright objects at @xmath18 have been observed by @xcite and @xcite and were found to have older and more massive stellar populations . finding individual old galaxies",
    "suggests that the formation and assembly of massive galaxies had already started by @xmath71 . as such sources are expected to be in the minority of the @xmath0 population , discovering a connected system of old galaxies would pose significant problems for our understanding of galaxy and structure formation .    to distinguish between these two scenarios ,",
    "multiband sed fitting of the sources is required . with the additional deeper near infrared and spitzer irac imaging",
    "that is currently being added to this extensive data set , it will be possible to probe the rest - frame uv to optical spectral energy distributions of these galaxies and determine whether they have young or old stellar populations .",
    "as noted previously in section [ sec : sample ] , the imaging dataset of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28-bands can be used to select high redshift objects at @xmath18 using an @xmath45 colour cut .",
    "a total of 73 candidates were observed spectroscopically with an @xmath72 and non detections in the @xmath23 and @xmath24-bands . from this sample",
    "two objects were confirmed to be galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "a galaxy with an observed @xmath73 and a colour of @xmath74 was confirmed to be at @xmath75 with strong line emission and weak continuum at longer wavelengths but none at shorter wavelengths . with a ly@xmath5 flux of @xmath76 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath9 ,",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width is 46  measured using the same method as the @xmath11 galaxies ( section [ sec : ew ] ) .",
    "the second galaxy was confirmed with a weaker ly@xmath5 line and continuum break at @xmath77 .",
    "this galaxy was observed to have @xmath78 and a colour of @xmath79 .",
    "the line flux and rest - frame equivalent width of this emission are @xmath80 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath9 and 8  respectively .",
    "( top frame ) and @xmath77 ( bottom frame ) .",
    "both show the spectral region between 7800  and 9800.,width=302 ]    of the other candidates observed , 8 were at low redshift and the remaining 63 had signal - to - noise too low to be able to identify the sources .",
    "the large number of unidentified objects is unsurprising given the decreasing response of the fors2 instrument beyond 9000 .",
    "with better instrumental responses and a wider range of wavelengths uncluttered by sky lines at shorter wavelengths , it is markedly easier to study @xmath11 galaxies than their higher redshift counterparts , even those observed when the universe was just 200 - 250myrs older .",
    "we have carried out a large spectroscopic survey of 10 widely - separate fields targeting @xmath11 lbgs .",
    "the candidates were selected using deep optical imaging combined with a colour selection tuned to identify the lyman break at @xmath11 .",
    "a total of 70 lbgs at @xmath4 have been identified , 38 galaxies with ly@xmath5 emission ranging in strength from @xmath6 to @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ( luminosities between @xmath81 and @xmath82 erg s@xmath9 ) , and 32 were identified by their strong continuum break at a rest wavelength of 1216 .",
    "an additional two galaxies were confirmed to be at @xmath18 , selected for their red @xmath83 colours . a comparison of the equivalent width distribution of the ly@xmath5 emission of the confirmed @xmath0 lbgs and that of @xmath84 lbgs from @xcite shows that the confirmed higher redshift objects are twice as likely to have large ( @xmath85 ) equivalent width ly@xmath5 emission . just over half of the @xmath0 objects have ly@xmath5 lines stronger than this .",
    "the largest measured equivalent width is @xmath86 .",
    "however , including plausible corrections for the spectroscopically - unconfirmed objects which are nevertheless at these redshifts removes any significant difference in the fraction of sources with large ( @xmath85 ) equivalent widths in both samples .",
    "a comparison of the average optical spectra and average @xmath52 colours of lbgs with and without detectable ly@xmath5 emission showed that the break - only galaxies had a redder colour and hence steeper rest - frame uv continuum slope than the line emitting galaxies .",
    "it is difficult for stellar age differences alone to explain this difference given the statistics on the ages of sources from @xcite .",
    "it can be straightforwardly explained by variations in reddening ( a difference of e(b - v)@xmath87 assuming a @xcite reddening law can account for the difference in colours ) and/or metallicity between the two subsamples , though age could clearly also play a part . a similar , but",
    "smaller colour difference is seen between samples of line - emitting and break - only lbgs at lower redshifts .",
    "if the local correlation between uv - slope and metallicity is assumed to be applicable at high redshifts , a typical @xmath0 lbg has a metallicity of approximately 0.1 - 0.2 of the solar value , approximately a third that of the metallicity of @xmath84 lbgs .",
    "the morphology of the confirmed @xmath11 galaxies was studied using high resolution hst / acs images and was found to be similar to that seen in larger photometric samples with a typical half - light radius of 0.15@xmath31 or 1kpc . however ,",
    "a higher fraction of multiple and disturbed systems was observed ( 16 out of 18 lbgs ) suggesting such systems are more likely to be confirmed spectroscopically , with a greater incidence of ly@xmath5 emission .",
    "a comparison of the multiple @xmath11 systems with local analogues of lbgs suggests that the components identified in the high resolution imaging could be either super - starburst regions within a larger structure with a surface brightness below the detection limit , or part of merging objects .",
    "the surface densities of lbgs in two of the ten fields are substantially higher than in the rest . in both cases",
    "the fields contain a clear excess of lbgs over a narrow range in redshift ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "although these are coherent structures , they may extend beyond the observed fields ( with scale sizes of 20 - 50 mpc ) and can not be bound or virialised systems .",
    "given the distances between the lbgs within these excesses and the expected short ( no more than a few tens of myr ) timescale for typical @xmath11 lbgs , the excess of systems can not be caused by gravitational interactions between the lbgs triggering starbursts .",
    "it is more likely that the lbgs are comparatively rare uv - luminous markers for a much larger mass ( both baryonic and dark ) of uv - dark material in these volumes .",
    "in addition to the survey for @xmath0 lbgs , we use the same photometric data to carry out a comparatively limited search for @xmath90 lbgs by looking for objects with spectral breaks between the @xmath25 and @xmath26-band images .",
    "we confirmed two such galaxies , one at @xmath75 with a ly@xmath5 line flux of @xmath91 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 and @xmath73 and another at @xmath77 with a much weaker ly@xmath5 line ( @xmath92 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 ) , but considerably brighter continuum ( @xmath78 ) .",

    "<S> we present the global results of a large spectroscopic survey carried out in order to identify @xmath0 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) across ten widely - separated @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 fields to a depth of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the redshifts of seventy @xmath4 lbgs were identified through their ly@xmath5 emission and/or a strong continuum break , with thirty eight sources showing detectable line emission of between @xmath6 and @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 . just over half of the spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath0 galaxies </S>",
    "<S> have rest - frame ly@xmath5 equivalent widths above 20  , double the frequency of similarly strong line emitters in similar @xmath10 lbg samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , when reasonable corrections are made for the spectroscopically - unconfirmed sources that are nevertheless at these redshifts in both samples , we find no significant difference in the frequency of high equivalent - width line emitters between the samples . </S>",
    "<S> the rest - frame uv continuum slope of a typical @xmath11 line - emitting galaxy ( as measured primarily from photometry , but also apparent in spectroscopy ) is bluer than that of a typical break - only galaxy , a difference that is difficult to explain purely by differences in the ages of their stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> variation in metallicity and/or dust extinction can more straightforwardly account for this difference . </S>",
    "<S> if the correlation between metallicity and uv continuum slope identified at low redshift is applicable at @xmath12 , the typical @xmath0 lbgs have metallicities a factor of three lower than those of lbgs at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> hst imaging of a subset of the lbgs indicates that a large majority of the spectroscopically - confirmed lbgs in our sample are members of multiple systems ( on @xmath13 arcsec scales ) and/or show disturbed morphology . using local lbg analogues as a model , this multiplicity </S>",
    "<S> could be explained either by super - starburst regions within a larger unseen structure , or by a high incidence of merging events at this epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the current data can not distinguish between these two possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density of @xmath11 lbgs in two of the ten fields is considerably higher than in the rest . </S>",
    "<S> both show clear spikes in their redshift distributions indicating strong three - dimensional clustering in these fields . against an expectation of about one source per 0.1 in redshift between @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> one field has seven identified objects between @xmath15 and the other has 17 between @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> neither structure can be bound given their depth in redshift and probably extend beyond the observed fields . </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional distances between lbgs in the structures are too large for them to have triggered their starbursts through mutual gravitational interaction , and so it is likely that the short - lived lbgs represent only a small fraction of the baryons in the structures .    </S>",
