    "over the last few years , observations of galaxies at @xmath4 have opened up a new window into the reionization epoch , turning it into the latest frontier both for observational and theoretical studies of galaxy formation .",
    "planned  @xcite and existing wide - area narrowband searches for @xmath0 objects such as the subaru deep field  @xcite , the large area lyman - alpha survey  @xcite , the chandra deep field - south  @xcite , and the hubble ultra deep field  @xcite are now combining with lyman - alpha dropout searches  @xcite , targeted searches near lensing caustics in galaxy clusters  @xcite and occasionally serendipity  @xcite to uncover star - forming galaxies from the reionization epoch in significant numbers .",
    "a question immediately raised by this new stream of observations is , what are the physical properties of these early galaxies ?",
    "optimally , one would determine properties such as the stellar mass , star formation rate , and metallicity directly from high - quality spectra , but at present this is infeasible for such faint systems .",
    "hence properties must be inferred from photometry alone , occasionally augmented by emission line information .",
    "this requires making some poorly constrained choices for the intrinsic galaxy properties . a commonly applied method known as spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting",
    "involves generating an ensemble of population synthesis models under a range of assumptions for the intrinsic nature of the object , and then finding the set of assumptions that best reproduces a given galaxy s observed photometry  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical properties that yield the lowest @xmath5 model are then forwarded as the most probable values , sometimes with little attention to statistical uniqueness or robustness  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a nice exploration of such issues )",
    ".    amongst the various assumptions used in sed fitting , the one that is often least well specified and produces the widest range in final answers is the galaxy s star formation history ( sfh ) . with no prior information ,",
    "common practice is to use simple sfhs with one free parameter such as constant , single - burst , or exponentially - decaying , which in aggregate are assumed to span the range of possible sfhs for a given galaxy . indeed , in most cases all one - parameter sfhs yield plausible results , though the parameters obtained and quality of fits in each case can vary significantly . if it were possible to narrow the allowed range of sfhs through independent considerations , physical parameters could in principle be more precisely determined .",
    "one approach for constraining sfhs a priori is to incorporate information from currently favored hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "as we will discuss in this paper , hydrodynamic simulations tend to produce a relatively narrow range of star formation histories for early galaxies .",
    "their galaxies sfhs tend to follow a generic _ form _ at these early epochs , best characterized as a constantly - rising sfh .",
    "this form is broadly independent of cosmology , feedback assumptions , or other ancillary factors , and is furthermore distinct from any one - parameter models commonly used today .",
    "a primary aim of this paper is to test whether this relatively generic sfh form is consistent with observations , and if so , what the implication are for the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies .    despite impressive recent successes in understanding cosmology and large - scale structure in our universe  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many uncertainties remain in our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "several recent papers have tested models of high-@xmath6 galaxy formation by comparing them to observed bulk properties such as luminosity functions at rest - frame uv and ly@xmath7  wavelengths .",
    "these comparisons have shown that such models are broadly successful at reproducing observations , under reasonable assumptions for poorly constrained parameters such as dust extinction  @xcite . while this broad success is encouraging , it is subject to some ambiguousness in interpretation , because the properties of individual galaxies are not being compared in detail .",
    "one could envision situations in which a model reproduces an ensemble property of galaxies but not the detailed spectra of individual objects . as an example",
    ", it was forwarded by @xcite that lyman break galaxies at @xmath8 are actually merger - driven starbursts , in contrast to many other models predicting them to be large quiescent objects . despite quite different sfhs , both models reproduced many of the same bulk properties such as number densities and clustering statistics . for @xmath9 galaxies where statistics are currently poor",
    ", such degeneracies can hamper interpretations of bulk comparisons of observations to models .",
    "a complementary set of constraints on galaxy formation models may be obtained by comparing models to the individual spectra of observed galaxies . in practice , for high-@xmath6 systems ,",
    "photometry over a reasonably wide set of bands must substitute for detailed spectra .",
    "such comparisons of models to data would move towards more precise and statistically robust analyses that do not rely on having a large ensemble of objects .",
    "this last aspect is critical , because the very earliest observed objects that may provide the greatest constraints on models will in practice always be few in number and detected only at the limits of current technology .    in short ,",
    "what is desireable would be a tool to compare models and observations of high - redshift galaxies that ( 1 ) employs reasonably generic predictions of current galaxy formation models ; ( 2 ) provides a quantitative and robust statistical assessment of how well such models reproduce observations ; ( 3 ) yields information on the physical properties of galaxies under various assumptions ; ( 4 ) obtains such information based solely on observed photometry ; and ( 5 ) does all this on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis rather than relying on having a large statistical sample of observed galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we introduce such a tool , called spoc  ( simulated photometry - derived observational constraints ) .",
    "spoc  takes as its input the photometry ( with errors ) of a single observed galaxy along with an ensemble of model spectra drawn either from simulations or generated using one - parameter sfhs .",
    "the output is probability distributions of physical parameters derived using a bayesian formalism , along with goodness - of - fit measures for any given model .",
    "the probability distributions give quantitative constraints on the galaxy s physical properties , while the goodness - of - fit can be used to discriminate between models and determine whether a given model ( be it simulated or one - parameter sfhs ) is able to provide an acceptable fit to that galaxy s photometry .    after introducing and testing spoc , we apply it to a sample of six @xmath2 galaxies from the literature that have published near - infrared photometry .",
    "we show that in five of six cases , the simulated galaxies fit observations at least as well as one - parameter sfhs . since there is no guarantee that simulations produce galaxy sfhs that actually occur in nature , the fact that good fits are possible shows that the existence of the majority of observed @xmath0 galaxies is straightforwardly accommodated in current galaxy formation models .",
    "however , in one case , we find that simulated galaxies provides a much poorer fit than can be obtained with one - parameter sfhs , as burstier sfhs provide a much better fit than can be obtained from any simulated galaxies . at face value",
    ", this implies that our simulations can not yet accommodate the full range of observed galaxies , and that some physical process may be missing , although we will explore alternate interpretations . for each galaxy we also present the best - fit physical parameters , with uncertainties , obtained using each model sfh .",
    "the simulations provide significantly tighter constraints than the full range of one - parameter sfhs , as expected based on their relatively small range of sfhs produced .",
    "these values can therefore be regarded as predictions of our simulations that may be tested against future observations .    ",

    "finally , in   [ sec : summary ] we present our conclusions .",
    "pedagogical explanations of sed fitting techniques have been presented elsewhere  @xcite , so we refer the reader there for more detailed discussion of those aspects . here",
    "we provide some basic insights and notes .    clearly , the amount of physical information that can be inferred from available data depends on the quantity and quality of the data . for some high-@xmath6 galaxies , only narrow - band photometry and rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopy",

    "studies employing the lyman dropout technique in the optical must further contend with the possible presence of low - redshift interlopers  @xcite and large uncertainties from dust extinction .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting constraints can be placed on the underlying physical properties of the sources from solely rest - uv data  @xcite .    with the addition of rest - frame optical data , e.g. from _",
    "spitzer s _ infrared array camera ( irac ) , it becomes possible to obtain simultaneous constraints for the stellar mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , dust extinction , and redshift using spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting techniques  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties inherent in such analyses primarily stem from a poor constraint on the age of the galaxy s stellar population , because the relationship between age and the strength of the telltale balmer break depends on the form of the assumed sfh ( @xcite ; figure  [ fig : degeneracy ] ) .",
    "this age uncertainty propagates via a host of degeneracies into increased uncertainties in the inferred stellar mass , sfr , metallicity , and dust extinction , if no priors are assumed on these quantities .",
    "additional uncertainties arise from the unknown form of the appropriate template sed  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the treatment of stellar evolution assumed by the chosen population synthesis models  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "still , sed fitting offers the most promising approach for determining the physical properties of individual high-@xmath6 galaxies .    given this",
    ", how can one employ simulations to improve constraints on sed fitting ?",
    "one can view a numerical simulation as producing a monte carlo sampling of parameter space such that the frequency with which a given set of physical parameters ought to occur is proportional to the number of galaxies in the simulation that are characterized by that set of parameters .",
    "in essence , numerically - simulated galaxies provide  implicit priors \" for sed fitting , i.e. solutions that are _ a priori _ weighted more heavily because they occur more frequently .",
    "the underlying assumption is that simulated galaxy sfhs represent those occuring in nature .",
    "this is by no means guaranteed , and indeed whether spoc  provides an acceptable fit to a given galaxy constitutes a stringent test of the simulation , because a galaxy s spectrum encodes information about its full sfh .",
    "this is the manner in which spoccan provide a test of galaxy formation models based on individual systems .",
    "we now summarize the bayesian statistical method employed in spoc .",
    "our goal is to constrain the stellar mass , sfr , mean stellar metallicity , age , dust extinction , and redshift ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath6 , respectively ) based on available measurements @xmath15 . according to bayes theorem ,",
    "the probability @xmath16 that the measurements @xmath15 correspond to a galaxy with the intrinsic physical parameters @xmath17 ( where a hat indicates a particular value of a parameter ) is given by @xmath18 the prior @xmath19 indicates the relative _ a priori _ probability that a randomly selected galaxy has this particular combination of parameters , and the likelihood @xmath20 indicates the probability of obtaining the measurements @xmath15 for a galaxy characterized by the parameters @xmath21 ; for a given model galaxy and data set @xmath15 this is assumed to be proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "any information regarding the expected distributions of physical properties of the observable galaxies ( such as the stellar mass function ) or relationships between these properties ( such as a mass - metallicity relation ) can be taken into account via a contribution to the prior , and will generally give rise to more precise  and possibly more accurate  constraints .    in this work , we assume uniform priors on @xmath6 and @xmath14 , and we do not assume any dependence between @xmath14 and the other intrinsic physical properties .",
    "we introduce an additional prior @xmath23 to account for any other priors .",
    "for example , when matching observed galaxies against model galaxies derived from the outputs of two cosmological simulations that span different comoving volumes , @xmath23 represents the ratio of the simulation volumes .",
    "after several applications of the product rule , we obtain @xmath24 this is the fundamental equation that spoc  evaluates .",
    "generically , one would use equation  [ bayes2 ] by beginning with a set of models that uniformly samples the relevant parameter space and then guessing the form of the prior @xmath25 , which now encodes the assumed distribution of intrinsic physical properties of galaxies as a function of redshift . in the high - redshift literature , where little is known about the intrinsic physical properties of the galaxies , it is common to neglect priors altogether ( or , equivalently , to choose the model with the lowest @xmath5 ) or even to introduce them accidentally by not sampling parameter space uniformly .",
    "the difference between this work and that of previous authors is that we account for this prior implicitly by using numerically simulated galaxies as the model set .    to see how this works ,",
    "consider how one would use equation  [ bayes2 ] in practice .",
    "for simplicity , suppose that we wished to constrain a galaxy s stellar mass and that the mass could only fall within one of two ranges .",
    "if we omitted priors and assumed that the models sample stellar mass uniformly , then the probability that the galaxy s mass falls within a given range would be given by @xmath26 , where the sum is taken over all models whose mass lies within that range and the normalization @xmath27 is chosen so that the sum taken over all models in both ranges equals unity . if we believed that galaxies with masses in one range were , say , twice as common ( and therefore _ a priori _ twice as likely to be the right answer ) as galaxies with masses in the other range , we could account for this via an explicit prior by changing the sum to @xmath28 where @xmath29 for models in the more common range and @xmath30 for models in the less common range ( with @xmath27 of course rescaled ) .",
    "it is clear that an equivalent method to employing this explicit prior would be to generate twice as many models in the more common range , resulting in twice the probability of selecting one of these models .",
    "generalizing this idea , one can view simulated galaxies as a monte carlo sampling of parameter space that naturally produces more models with parameters that are more commonly found .",
    "hence by taking a set of simulated galaxies , generating a library by resampling this set with parameters having uniform priors ( namely , @xmath31 and @xmath6 ) , and using that library to discretely sample the probability distribution in the right - hand side of equation  [ bayes2 ] , one can solve equation  [ bayes2 ] effectively incorporating the implicit priors given by the simulated galaxies .",
    "this is in essence the spocalgorithm .",
    "a major difficulty with the spoc  approach is that there is no guarantee that the simulation predicts the correct distribution of intrinsic properties of galaxies ; in bayesian terms , the priors could be wrong . on some level",
    "this is bound to be the case as we do not account for every process that could _ in principle _ affect galaxies at this epoch ; indeed , no model currently does .",
    "however , our goal is to determine whether our treatment is _ sufficient _ to account for current observations .",
    "if not , then the failures indicate needed improvements to the model .",
    "if our treatment can account for current observations , then the constraints that we derive may be regarded as physically - motivated predictions , subject to verification when more constraining data become available .",
    "the two greatest uncertainties for the input physics present in our current simulations are ( 1 ) numerical resolution  manifested either as an inability to account for physical processes that occur on scales that are too small or too rapid ( e.g. merger - induced starburst ) or as a lack of numerical convergence  and ( 2 ) the prescription for superwind feedback . in ",
    "[ sec : resolution ] we use a simple convergence test to argue that our results do not suffer from numerical resolution limitations . as to our treatment for outflows",
    ", we can estimate the extent of any resulting systematics by comparing results from our three different outflow simulations .",
    "while this does not span the full range of possible feedback mechanisms , the fact that ( as we show in   [ sec : winddust ] ) most of the best - fit parameters are insensitive to the choice of wind prescription suggests that outflows do not noticeably alter typical sfhs at a given stellar mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "if there are significant physical processes affecting galaxy seds that are not accounted for by our simulation or population synthesis models , then our simulated galaxies may fail to reproduce the observed spectra , or they may mistakenly model nonstellar contributions to the observed sed as starlight . among the possibilities here",
    "are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , incorrectly modeled thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars  @xcite , emission lines , and an inappropriate treatment of dust or igm absorption .",
    "we will argue in  [ sec : othergals ] that significant agn contamination is unlikely for the high - redshift objects we will consider here .",
    "the contribution of tp - agb stars is also unlikely to be important partly because we do not model measurements from bands redder than @xmath32 in the rest - frame , and partly because at @xmath33 less than half of the existing stellar mass is more than 200 myr old ( table  [ table : many_objs ] ) .",
    "emission lines and incorrectly - modelled igm absorption could in principle affect our results at the 10% level  @xcite .",
    "these effects are expected to be similar for the various sfhs investigated because we use the same population synthesis models to model the stellar continuum in each case . regarding dust ,",
    "we have found , in agreement with  @xcite , that our results are relatively insensitive to the form of the dust law that we consider ( see   [ sec : consistency ] ) .",
    "thus , for the preliminary study in this paper we ignore all of these effects .",
    "another possible problem is that galaxy classes that are rare in reality are likely to be rare in the simulations .",
    "accordingly , if the comoving volume from which the catalog of simulated comparison galaxies is drawn is sufficiently small that a simulated analogue to an observed rare object is neither expected nor found , that object can not directly constrain the model .",
    "for example , our simulations produce no galaxies massive enough at @xmath34 to fit hudf - jd2 , the putative @xmath35 object at @xmath36 reported by  @xcite .",
    "although this particular object is likely to be at a lower redshift @xcite , it does illustrate limitations imposed by simulation volume , which could also impact constraints on rare classes such as sub - millimeter galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ( alternatively ,",
    "if such objects are indeed common at @xmath37 then they represent a challenge to our simulations ) . in principle",
    "one could work around this issue by running larger - volume simulations or by deriving the priors from the simulations and then resampling parameter space by hand .",
    "in lieu of these approaches , the simulations utilized must have comoving volumes comparable to the effective volume of the survey in which the object was found .",
    "it may appear overly ambitious to attempt to constrain 6 ( or more ) seemingly independent parameters for a galaxy for which fewer than 6 measurements are available .",
    "however , cosmological simulations allow us to do this because they generically predict that galaxies intrinsic physical parameters are manifestly _ not _ independent ; there are tight predicted correlations between , for example , stellar mass on the one hand and star formation rate and metallicity on the other  @xcite .    in summary , using simulated galaxies to estimate physical properties is only valid when the dominant emission mechanism is star formation , and when other uncertainties can be carefully analyzed and shown to be negligible . for galaxies at high redshift , such as the ones we consider in this paper , this is believed ( but not guaranteed ) to be true .",
    "however , in the general case these issues must be considered carefully . in turn , the goodness of fit enables constraints to be placed on simulations of galaxy formation , and can highlight missing physics that may be required in order to explain the observed properties of galaxies .",
    "we draw our simulated galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with gadget-2  @xcite , including our improvements as described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter od06 ) .",
    "this code uses an entropy - conservative formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) along with a tree - particle - mesh algorithm for handling gravity .",
    "heating is included via a spatially uniform photoionizing background  @xcite , which is an acceptable approximation for the galaxies that are observed at high redshift owing to the fact that they form in highly overdense regions that undergo local reionization at @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "all gas particles are allowed to cool under the assumption of ionization equilibrium , and metal - enriched particles may additionally cool via metal lines .",
    "cool gas particles are allowed to develop a multi - phase interstellar medium via a subresolution multi - phase model that tracks condensation and evaporation following  @xcite .",
    "stars are formed from cool , dense gas using a recipe that reproduces the @xcite relation ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the metallicity of star - forming gas particles grows in proportion to the sfr under the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "stars inherit the metallicity of the parent gas particle , and from then on can not be further enriched .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that do not include kinetic feedback from star formation invariably overproduce stars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* od06 ) . because superwinds can affect the physical properties of the simulated galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider model galaxies from simulations with three different superwind schemes : ( 1 ) a  no wind \" model that omits superwind feedback ; ( 2 ) a  constant wind \" ( cw ) model in which all the particles entering into superwinds are expelled at 484  km / s out of star forming regions and a constant mass loading factor ( i.e. the ratio of the rate of matter expelled to the sfr ) of 2 is assumed ( as in the runs of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( 3 ) the  momentum - driven wind \" ( vzw ) model of  od06 , in which the imparted velocity is proportional to the local velocity dispersion ( computed from the potential ) and the mass loading factor is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion @xcite , as inferred from observations of local starbursts @xcite .",
    "this selection is meant to bracket plausible models in order to expose any related systematic uncertainties ; however , owing to the range of successes in comparison with igm metal - line observations obtained by  od06 for the vzw model , we focus on this model when the conclusions from the different wind models are broadly similar .",
    "all of our wind models were tested in simulations that assumed the  old \" wmap - concordant cosmology @xcite having @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "each of our simulations has @xmath44 particles , with parameters as given in od06 .",
    "we only employ the @xmath45 and @xmath46 simulations from od06 , as the @xmath47 runs did not have any galaxies large enough to be observable at @xmath9 .",
    "an additional set of simulations ( the  jvzw \" model ) were run using our preferred wind model with the 3rd - year wmap cosmology  @xcite , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . due to an error in the initial conditions generation ,",
    "the power spectrum index was set to @xmath53 rather than the currently - favored @xmath54 ; however , this has little impact on our results as we will show that they are insensitive to such differences in cosmology .",
    "there is a slight change in the wind model for jvzw versus vzw , in that jvzw has a smaller mass loading factor by a factor of two - thirds compared to vzw ( in the terminology of od06 , @xmath55  km / s ) in order to compensate for the lower collapse fraction at high redshift in the new cosmology .",
    "in addition to @xmath45 and @xmath46 box sizes , we also run a @xmath56 box with the jvzw model to sample the bright end of the mass function in order to better constrain some observed galaxies that we will consider in  [ sec : othergals ] .",

    "the most important output of the simulations is the set of sfhs corresponding to the resolved galaxies in each simulation at the various redshift outputs .",

    "this model has to our knowledge not been investigated before .    in order to facilitate comparison with much of the available sed - fitting work that is available in the literature ,",

    "note that these spectra and @xmath117 values are purely representative ; in practice we obtain physical constraints through the bayesian analysis described in  [ sec : spoc ] rather than by simply examining the best - fitting model .",
    "it is encouraging that the fits obtained from our simulated galaxy library are generally equally as compelling , in terms of goodness - of - fit measure @xmath117 , as the fits that result from the one - parameter sfh model libraries .",
    "taken together , these findings strongly support the idea that most observed reionization - epoch galaxies possess theoretical analogues within our simulations .",
    "however , some of these objects show minor discrepancies that may be hinting at some failing in the models .",
    "given the currently large observational uncertainties it is difficult to place robust constraints on the models , but it is nevertheless worthwhile to discuss each of these systems in detail in order to illustrate how spoc  can be used to both reveal physical characteristics as well as test the underlying model .     _",

    "such systems are not expected to produce h@xmath7 equivalent widths that would contribute significantly to the broad - band flux , we adopt the uncorrected 4.5@xmath69 m measurement .",
    "we verified that , if we use the h@xmath7-corrected 4.5@xmath69 m flux obtained by  cse05 , the inferred sfr drops from @xmath120 to @xmath121 ; this value is in conflict with the assumed line strength as expected .",
    "the @xmath122 m limits quoted in the text of  cse05 are different from the limit plotted in their figure 2 ; we adopt the less restrictive limit from the figure .",
    "when we do not enforce the spectroscopic redshift , the photometric redshift @xmath123 is dominated by the @xmath124 limit and is roughly @xmath125 below the spectroscopic redshift ; the formal redshift uncertainty is dominated by the size of the @xmath124 baseline .",
    "although the one - parameter models yield more accurate photometric redshifts in this case , the difference is comparable to the formal uncertainty and we regard it more as a coincidence than as a clue to the sfh of this object .",
    "a more accurate photometric redshift would require us to include the unpublished measurement in @xmath32 and an accurate @xmath126 transmission curve ; we have used the sdss @xmath127 profile because a transmission curve for the @xmath126 measurement used by  @xcite is not available .    the fits that we obtain are very good , although we confirm that the 4.5@xmath69 m measurement is difficult to interpret as purely stellar continuum emission .",
    "in fact , even without the anomalous @xmath118 m flux the uv continuum is difficult to understand owing to the dip at @xmath128  @xcite , and the measured ly@xmath7  flux is difficult to reconcile with the observed ly@xmath7  luminosity function at @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "thus , until more precise measurements of this object are available , any inferences regarding its physical properties should probably be regarded as suggestive .    with these caveats in mind , we find that using the simulated models yields inferred stellar mass , sfr , and @xmath14 that are fully consistent with previous derivations as well as with the one - parameter model sfhs . the range of stellar masses allowed by the jvzw models nicely brackets the range between the emission line - dominated and stellar continuum - dominated solutions suggested by  cse05 , and the range of sfrs is consistent with the derivation of  @xcite based on the ly@xmath7  line and well below the inferred h@xmath7-based sfr of  cse05 .",
    "turning to the one - parameter models , the widest uncertainties for all of the parameters are provided by the decaying model , with the results from the constant and rising models spanning a somewhat smaller subset of this space .",
    "the results from the rising model are generally the closest match to the jvzw models although they permit a somewhat larger range of sfr ; these are burst - like models that have no analogue in our simulations .     _",

    "the minimum age for each model is older than the ages for the other objects in our sample because the small measured uncertainties on the 3.6@xmath69 m fluxes for sbm03#1 and # 3 create the strongest case for a pronounced balmer break . in our simulations ,",
    "such objects are roughly 130200 myr old and are forming stars at a healthy 3060 @xmath62 ( both @xmath78 ) .",
    "the resulting intrinsically blue colours cause spoc  to select moderate dust extinctions @xmath14 of 0.40.9 and 00.1 for # 1 and # 3 , respectively , in order to match their uv continuum slopes . while these sfrs are within the full range inferred via the one - parameter models , they are generally more active and younger than inferred via the decaying and constant models .",
    "the discrepancy owes primarily to the fact that the constant and decaying models permit higher sfrs at early times ( @xmath133 ) than occur in our simulations . because the rising model excludes such early episodes , it yields constraints that are more similar to the results from the jvzw models .",
    "the photometric redshifts for sbm03#1 and # 3 are 13@xmath134 below the spectroscopic values for both simulation and one - parameter models , suggesting that unknown systematic uncertainties such as uncertainty owing to inaccurate filter profiles should be folded into the formal uncertainties ; in future work an enforced minimum redshift uncertainty of @xmath135 seems reasonable .",

    "table  [ table : many_objs ] shows that the @xmath117 per degree of freedom is lower for the one - parameter models than for the simulated models , because the one - parameter models have the freedom to produce a higher @xmath131 flux through a higher sfr and @xmath14 together with a lower stellar mass ; galaxies with these combinations of high sfr ( @xmath136 ) and low stellar mass ( @xmath137 ) simply do not occur in our simulations",

    "we therefore do not show the results from # 5abc .",
    "by contrast , we obtain excellent fits for object # 7ab .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given that # 7ab is clearly a mixture of two components ( figure 1 in  @xcite ) , and probably owes largely to the fact that it does not show anomalous single - band fluxes in the way that hcm  6a , sbm03#3 , and glare#3001 do .",
    "the photometric redshift is constrained to @xmath140 , @xmath125 higher than the photometric redshift determined by  @xcite ( although they do not quote an uncertainty ) .",
    "stellar mass is relatively poorly constrained owing to the relatively low signal - to - noise in the observed 3.6@xmath69 m band .",
    "as figure  [ fig : degall ] shows , when we apply spoc  with our simulated models , the poorly - constrained stellar mass leads directly to a poorly - constrained sfr . comparing with the one - parameter models , we find that these span an even larger ( overlapping ) space .",
    "this object illustrates the importance of high - quality near - infrared data in order to understand the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "@xcite applied exponentially - decaying models to this object and found a burst - like best - fit solution with a stellar mass of @xmath141 ( when converted to a chabrier imf ) , little current star formation ( @xmath142 ) , no dust extinction , and an age of 50100 myr .",
    "the stellar mass is fully consistent with our jvzw results .",
    "however , we find disagreement in the inferred dust extinction , sfr , and age because in the simulations galaxies of this stellar mass and redshift are invariably older and are still forming stars .",

    "once again , the absence of burst - like models in our simulations constitutes an effective prior that excludes such solutions .",
    "when we apply our own exponentially - decaying models to this object we find that the probability density possesses a sharp peak at low ages ( @xmath146 myr ) and a broad but slightly lower plateau at older ages .",
    "so while we formally obtain the lowest @xmath5 for burst - like models , folding in our simulation prior leads to an older age being preferred .",
    "this object is therefore a classic case where simply taking the lowest @xmath5 among all sfhs results in a substantially different interpretation than that obtained using physically - motivated priors",
    ". it will be interesting to see with improved obervations whether or not the simulation prediction ends up being correct .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ table : many_objs ] combines @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the age of the universe @xmath147 at each galaxy s redshift into an estimate of the ratio of the present- to past - averaged sfr , @xmath148 .",
    "a value of @xmath149 less than unity indicates a declining sfh whereas a value greater than unity indicates a rising sfh .",

    "@xcite have previously used this quantity to argue that galaxies that exhibit balmer breaks at @xmath33 must be experiencing a declining sfh .",
    "in contrast , table  [ table : many_objs ] indicates that , while this possibility is permitted by the decaying models at the @xmath79 level for all but one of the galaxies that we consider , it is by no means required while other models do not because decaying models can yield blue colors along with a lower specific sfr than the other models . ] . for our physically - motivated models",
    "it is not permitted owing to the generally rising sfhs in our simulations , but in fact even for the decaying models it is not the favored solution when the full range of possibilities is taken into account .",
    "hence we do not find that the presence of a balmer break requires a declining sfh .",
    "the disagreement between our results and those of  @xcite owes partly to the slightly different model sets used in the two analyses , and partly to our employing the full probability densities rather than restricting our attention to the model with the lowest @xmath5 .",
    "most importantly , however , this disagreement emphasizes the fact that the form of the correct sfh is not constrained by the current measurements and hence the conclusions are highly model - dependent .    in these fits",
    ", we have not considered the possibility of any agn contribution to the seds . from rest",
    "- uv photometry alone it is difficult to rule out this possibility .",
    "fitting power laws of the form @xmath151 to their rest - frame uv continua , we obtain slopes in the range @xmath152 $ ] with a weighted mean of -0.61 .",
    "these are not significantly different from the slopes inferred by  @xcite from 39 quasars at @xmath153 , with a mean and standard deviation of -0.79 and 0.34 , respectively . however , with _ spitzer_/irac photometry the balmer breaks in a2218 kesr , sbm03#1 , sbm03#3 , and y05#7ab are clearly evident .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and  @xcite argue that agn can be ruled out for three of the objects ( sbm03#1 , sbm03#3 , and glare#3001 ) based on upper limits to the flux of the n@xmath154v doublet at 1240 , the lack of any x - ray detection , and the relatively small velocity width of the observed ly@xmath7  lines ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "these arguments also apply to a370  hcm  6a .",
    "additionally , cse05 note that the latter object is similar to high - redshift ly@xmath7  emitters , for which the agn fraction is constrained to be less than 5%  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that agn do not dominate their rest - frame optical spectra , and emphasizes the usefulness of _ spitzer_/irac measurements for constraining the properties of reionization - epoch objects .",
    "hence it seems reasonable to model all of these objects with stellar population synthesis models alone , as we have done .    in summary , we are usually but not always able to find galaxies within our simulations whose photometry suggests that they could be the theoretical counterpart to observed reionization - epoch galaxies . using these models as inputs to our sed - fitting engine , spoc , we obtain physical constraints on the properties of the galaxies that are , in five out of six cases , consistent with the results from one - parameter model sfhs . in the remaining case ,",
    "the observed sed leads the one - parameter models to prefer burst - like scenarios that do not occur in our simulations . in all cases",
    "the tightness of constraints from the simulated models is equal to or better than that from one - parameter model sfhs .",
    "albeit small , this sample of systems illustrates how using spoc  to compare among sfhs can provide insights into the physics of early galaxy formation , and identify unusual galaxies that provide the tightest constraints on such models .",
    "in this paper we present a bayesian sed - fitting engine called spoc , which provides constraints on the physical properties of galaxies from photometric data .",
    "spoc  takes as input a galaxy s photometry and a set of model galaxy spectra , obtained either by assuming an analytic form for the galaxy s star formation history or from numerical simulations of galaxy formation , and outputs probability distributions for the physical properties of individual galaxies based on those model priors .",
    "here we compare and explore implications for different models , with an eye towards better constraining the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies .    because spoc  is intended to test whether predicted sfhs match those inferred from data , it provides constraints on models of galaxy formation that complement comparisons to bulk properties such as galaxy luminosity functions or clustering .",
    "a successful model must not only reproduce observed bulk statistics , but must also reproduce the colors of individual galaxies across all observed bands . galaxies with photometry that can not be well fit in a given model provide insights into model failings , and ultimately into the physics that drives galaxy formation .",
    "using spocit is possible to quantitatively determine how well a particular model matches an individual galaxy .",
    "such a methodology is particularly useful at epochs when only a small number of galaxies are detectable , such as for the earliest galaxies known .",
    "we show that spoc  accurately recovers the input physical parameters of model galaxies when fitted with sfh derived from the simulations themselves , with typical systematic errors less than the formal @xmath78 fitting errors .",
    "when a simulated galaxy is fit with one - parameter star formation histories or the incorrect extinction model , then larger deviations can occur .",
    "since the true sfh and extinction law are unknown , these deviations can be regarded as systematic errors on the determination of physical parameters . in most cases ,",
    "such systematic errors are less than 50% in stellar mass , star formation rate , and @xmath31 , and @xmath156 in redshift .",
    "we then apply spoc  to six galaxies at @xmath0 that have published photometry spanning the 4000  break ( which is necessary in order to obtain meaningful constraints on physical properties ) .",
    "we begin with a more in - depth study of abell 2218 kesr ( @xmath157 ) , since at present it is probably the best - studied reionization - epoch system , and then apply spoc  to five more galaxies in order to investigate a wider variety of galaxy properties .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as follows :    * the physical parameters derived for abell 2218 kesr using our library of simulated galaxies are in line with previous determinations , and those employing various one - parameter sfhs .",
    "the formal uncertainties are smaller when using simulated galaxies , because the simulations intrinsically produce a relatively narrow range of sfhs for galaxies at these epochs .",
    "the existence of an object with the properties of abell 2218 kesr at these epochs does not pose a significant challenge to current models of galaxy formation . *",
    "all inferred physical parameters for abell 2218 kesr except metallicity are remarkably insensitive to the explored choices for superwind feedback model , dust extinction law , and cosmology .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that regardless of such choices , simulations produce a similar _ form _ for the sfh of early galaxies .",
    "disappointingly , this means that photometry alone can not constrain such modeling uncertainties . on the other hand , this means that simulation predictions of physical parameters using spoc  are quite robust .",
    "discrimination between , say , superwind feedback models can be obtained through comparisons with bulk properties such as luminosity functions ( as shown in * ? ? ? * ) . * exploring a set of six @xmath0 galaxies , we find that for five of the systems the simulated galaxies and one - parameter models produce overlapping probability contours and best - fit physical parameters that are formally consistent , and the minimum reduced @xmath5 is similar between all models .",
    "this shows that simulations are usually but not always able to produce galaxies with properties similar to observed @xmath158 systems . *",
    "the spectra of simulated galaxies always show a significant balmer break , despite the fact that their sfhs are best characterized as constantly - rising ( not decaying ) .",
    "the median stellar age is @xmath159  myr ( @xmath79 ) for all six objects , spanning a range in stellar masses from @xmath160 .",
    "hence the existence of somewhat older stellar populations in these early systems is consistent with simulation predictions . *",
    "the object glare#3001 is an outlier that is poorly fit by our simulations , though in fairness the fits with one - parameter models are not optimal either .",
    "the best fits tend to favor models with younger stellar ages , lower masses , and higher sfrs than any simulated galaxies , perhaps indicating that this is a galaxy undergoing a burst .",
    "however , as discussed in the text , these fits are mainly driven by a high @xmath161-band flux .",
    "if that data point were confirmed it would suggest that the simulations may be missing some physical process(es ) that governs a small fraction of galaxies at this epoch .",
    "our hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation make some clear predictions for the star formation histories of galaxies at these early epochs .",
    "in particular , they predict that the stellar mass , star formation rate , and metallicity are all tightly correlated  @xcite .",
    "indeed such trends are generically seen in most hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation , though not necessarily in semi - analytic models .",
    "our preliminary comparisons to @xmath158 galaxies show that , while the simulations are not necessarily statistically favored over other classes of sfhs , the available data at least do not rule out these simulation predictions . together with the fact that such simulations can reproduce key bulk properties of early galaxies  @xcite , this suggests that models of early galaxy formation are able to reproduce a range of observed properties of galaxies at these epochs .    in this work",
    "we have performed the simplest possible spectral synthesis calculations , primarily because our focus has been a comparison between different sfh models . in the future",
    "we plan to investigate different population synthesis models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , imfs  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nonstellar contributions to the observed fluxes such as emission lines from hii regions .",
    "eventually we will apply spoc  to a larger sample of galaxies , which will enable a number of interesting investigations .",
    "first , the bulk statistics ( e.g. stellar mass or star formation rate functions ) derived using spoc  can be compared against that directly produced in simulations . while this is partly a circular comparison",
    "because simulated galaxies are being used to infer the physical properties , in practice there is no guarantee that consistency will be achieved because the simulated sfhs are quite generic ; hence this should provide a stringent test of models of galaxy formation .",
    "second , spoc  can be used to identify populations of galaxies that deviate dramatically from simulation predictions ( such as glare#3001 ) , in order to isolate which physical processes may be missing in models . in principle this could quantify the contributions from nonstellar emission - dominated sources such as agn and extremely dusty objects .",
    "finally , the redshift evolution of the galaxy population provides a strong test of models , particularly investigating the dramatic change in the nature of massive galaxies that appears to occur at @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "spoc  is a general - purpose code , in principle able to utilize any type of model that produces detailed galaxy sfhs , be it a hydrodynamic , semi - analytic , or analytic model . in principle",
    "there is nothing that restricts spoc  to high redshift use , but in practice other physical phenomena such as agn contamination may become more important at lower redshifts .",
    "spoc  could also provide a useful tool to identify galaxy classes that are not readily reproduced in current models .",
    "we are currently planning to make spoc  and our latest library of simulated galaxies publicly available upon publication of this paper .",
    "we hope that spoc  will be a useful and flexible tool for conducting detailed comparisons between simulations and observations , as are critical for advancing our understanding of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> we conduct a detailed comparison of broad - band spectral energy distributions of six @xmath0 galaxies against galaxies drawn from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a new tool called spoc , which constrains the physical properties of observed galaxies through a bayesian likelihood comparison with model galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that spoc  self - consistently recovers the physical properties of a test sample of high - redshift galaxies drawn from our simulations , although dust extinction can yield systematic uncertainties at the @xmath1 level . </S>",
    "<S> we then use spoc  to test whether our simulations can reproduce the observed photometry of six @xmath2 galaxies drawn from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we compare physical properties derived from simulated star formation histories ( sfhs ) versus assuming simple models such as constant , exponentially - decaying , and constantly rising . for five objects , </S>",
    "<S> our simulated galaxies match the observations at least as well as simple sfh models , with similar favored values obtained for the intrinsic physical parameters such as stellar mass and star formation rate , but with substantially smaller uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> our results are broadly insensitive to simulation choices for galactic outflows and dust reddening . </S>",
    "<S> hence the existence of early galaxies as observed is broadly consistent with current hierarchical structure formation models . </S>",
    "<S> however , one of the six objects has photometry that is best fit by a bursty sfh unlike anything produced in our simulations , driven primarily by a high @xmath3-band flux . </S>",
    "<S> these findings illustrate how spoc  provides a robust tool for optimally utilizing hydrodynamic simulations ( or any model that predicts galaxy sfhs ) to constrain the physical properties of individual galaxies having only photometric data , as well as identify objects that challenge current models .    </S>",
