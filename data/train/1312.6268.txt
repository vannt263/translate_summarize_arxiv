    "the fundamental problem of determining the minimum time required to perform a quantum process , and the dual problem of designing time - optimal hamiltonians , have recently attracted much attention because of their significance in several modern applications of quantum mechanics .",
    "these include quantum metrology @xcite , quantum computation and information @xcite , and optimal control theory @xcite .",
    "limits on the minimal evolution time also play a role in cosmology @xcite , and quantum thermodynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the terminology introduced by margolus and levitin @xcite and call lower bounds on the time it takes for a quantum system to evolve from one state into another _ quantum speed limits_. more specifically , we refer to lower bounds that involve the energy uncertainty as mandelstam - tamm ( mt ) quantum speed limits .",
    "bhattacharyya @xcite was one of the first to derive an mt quantum speed limit ( see also @xcite ) . assuming mandelstam and tamm s uncertainty relation , he showed through accurate estimates of the rate of change of the `` quantum non - decay probability '' that it takes at least the time @xmath0 for a system to evolve between two orthogonal pure states .",
    "a few years later , anandan and aharonov @xcite confirmed bhattacharyya s result .",
    "but more importantly , they revealed the geometric nature of the mt quantum speed limits , showing that @xmath1 times the path integral of the energy uncertainty of a unitarily evolving pure state equals the fubini - study length of the curve traced out by the state .",
    "few evolution time estimates for quantum systems in mixed states have been derived by differential geometric methods , despite the differential geometric approach in @xcite . until now",
    ", most mt quantum speed limits for mixed states have been obtained from estimates of the growth of the bures length @xcite , which is a statistical distance measure .",
    "soon after the publication of @xcite , uhlmann @xcite showed that the time it takes for a system to evolve from one mixed state into another is bounded from below by @xmath2 times the fraction of the bures length between the states and the energy uncertainty of the system .",
    "uhlmann s result has been verified in several publications , e.g. @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop anandan and aharonov s approach .",
    "we use symplectic reduction to construct a principal fiber bundle over a general space of isospectral ( i.e. unitarily equivalent ) mixed quantum states .",
    "the bundle , which generalizes the hopf bundle for pure states , gives rise in a canonical way to a riemannian metric and a symplectic form on the space of isospectral mixed states . using these",
    "we then derive an mt quantum speed limit for unitarily driven quantum systems , which proves to be sharper than the uhlmann limit .",
    "the speed of a quantum evolution depends also on the system s energy resources .",
    "margolus and levitin @xcite showed that the time it takes for a non - driven system to unitarily evolve between two orthogonal pure states is bounded from below by a factor that is inversely proportional to the energy of the system .",
    "generalizing margolus and levitin s result to systems in mixed states has proven to be quite difficult .",
    "@xcite have derived an `` implicit '' margolus - levitin ( ml ) quantum speed limit for non - driven systems , and deffner and lutz @xcite used the methods put forward by jones and kok @xcite to derive an estimate of margolus - levitin type for driven systems .",
    "the present paper also contains a generalization of margolus and levitin s quantum speed limit to driven systems in mixed states .",
    "the speed limit is different from that of deffner and lutz , and it reduces to a greater speed limit than theirs for systems with time - independent hamiltonians .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ red pur bund ] , we set up the geometric framework , and introduce most of the notation we use in the rest of the paper . in sections [ evolution time ] and [ margolus ] we derive an mt quantum speed limit and an ml quantum speed limit , respectively , for the time it takes to unitarily run a quantum system from one mixed state into another .",
    "section [ optimal hamiltonians ] contains a characterization of the hamiltonians that optimize evolution time for finite - level systems in generic mixed states , as well as an example of a system for which the mt quantum speed limit derived in section [ evolution time ] is greater than the corresponding limit involving the bures length .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "evolving quantum states will be represented by curves of density operators .",
    "the curves are assumed to be defined on an unspecified interval @xmath3 , and the final time @xmath4 will be referred to as the evolution time .",
    "compositions of linear mappings will be written as concatenations . by a `` function '' we mean a real - valued smooth function , and by a `` functional '' we mean a real - valued linear function .",
    "we use the same notation , namely @xmath5 , for the identity map of every space .",
    "this paper concerns quantum systems in mixed states which evolve unitarily .",
    "the systems will be modeled on a hilbert space @xmath6 and their states will be represented by density operators .",
    "we write @xmath7 for the space of density operators on @xmath6 , and @xmath8 for the space of density operators on @xmath6 which have finite rank at most @xmath9 .",
    "a quantum state is called pure if it can be represented by a single unit vector . in quantum information theory and geometric quantum mechanics",
    "it is common to make use of the fact that mixed states can be considered as reduced pure states @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use the fact that if @xmath10 is a @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space and @xmath11 is the unit sphere in the space @xmath12 of linear operators from @xmath10 to @xmath6 , equipped with the hilbert - schmidt inner product , then @xmath13 is a surjective map .",

    "this algebra consists of all anti - hermitian operators on @xmath10 which commute with @xmath21 .",
    "it follows from the marsden - weinstein - meyer symplectic reduction theorem @xcite that @xmath18 admits a symplectic form which is pulled back to @xmath51 by @xmath45 .",
    "we will not need the full strength of this fact , only that @xmath41 is preserved by the left action by @xmath19 .",
