    "the weak decays of the heavy baryon @xmath2 provide an ideal place to extract information about the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parameters and explore the mechanism of cp violation complementary to the b meson system .",
    "for the non - leptonic processes , the strong interaction dynamics is very complicated .",
    "thus , these processes are also good probes to test different qcd models and factorization approaches . in early works of @xcite , the weak decay of @xmath2 to @xmath6 and light baryons ( @xmath3 , @xmath7 )",
    "are systematically studied .",
    "the hadronic transition matrix elements parameterized by form factors are calculated by use of a light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite .",
    "since there are three valence quarks in a baryon , the quark - diquark picture was employed for simplification .",
    "it is found that the diquark approximation not only greatly simplifies the calculations , but also gives well theoretical predictions .    with a simple factorization hypothesis , many non - leptonic processes of @xmath2 to a light baryon and a meson are calculated in @xcite .",
    "the theory predictions of branching ratios are well consistent with the experiment data except one process of @xmath8 .",
    "the theory result is @xmath9 , which is one order smaller than the data @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "what is the reason ?",
    "in fact , the physics reason had been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed at the tree level . in most cases ,",
    "the tree operator contribution is dominant .",
    "however , for the @xmath8 process , the tree level contribution is suppressed by the ckm matrix elments @xmath10 . for the penguin diagram ,",
    "the main contribution comes from the loop where top quark is the dominant intermediate fermion",
    ". the ckm entry would be @xmath11 which is almost 50 times larger than @xmath10 .",
    "thus even though there is a loop suppression of order @xmath12 , it is compensated by the much larger ckm parameter , so the contributions from penguin diagrams are dominant .",
    "the effects of qcd penguin have been displayed in @xmath13 processes .",
    "for example , the process of @xmath14 is qcd penguin dominated and its branching ratio is @xmath15 , while for a tree dominated process @xmath16 with @xmath17 , the ratio is a factor of three smaller than that of @xmath14 .    using the method of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach ,",
    "@xmath18 has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath19 in conventional pqcd approach and @xmath20 in hybrid pqcd approach .",
    "we can see that it is smaller than a half of the experimental data @xmath5 . in this paper",
    ", we will study the qcd corrections in the decay @xmath18 at one - loop order within the framework of qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "this factorization approach provides a systematic method to treat the non - factorizable qcd effects .",
    "it has been widely applied into many b meson non - leptonic processes .",
    "we will employ this approach into the heavy baryon decays , the @xmath18 process in this study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we list the effective hamiltonian for the transition @xmath8 , give the qcd factorization approach to @xmath8 , the decay rate , and then discuss cp asymmetry and the relation to decay of @xmath21 . in section iii , we will give the numerical calculations .",
    "in section iv , a discussion and conclusion is provided .",
    "corrections to the hard - scattering kernels @xmath56 ( first two rows)and @xmath57 ( last row ) ]    the naive factorization neglects the strong interactions between the final @xmath58 meson and two baryons .",
    "it is necessary to consider the non - factorizable contributions .",
    "there are several approaches which are beyond the naive factorization . in this study",
    ", we use the method called qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization proves that in the heavy quark limit , the decay amplitude can be factorized into a product of hard scattering kennel and non - perturbative part .",
    "the @xmath58 meson and proton are both light hadron and energetic .",
    "the interaction between them should be caused by large momentum transfer .",
    "although the proof is given for the b meson case , it would be valid for the baryon system , too . since we adopt the diquark approximation",
    ", the complications caused by more valence quarks nearly vanish .",
    "the diquark , as a whole , seems to be a light quark ( it should be noted that the diquark in our case is a scalar while quark is a fermion ) .",
    "thus , we assume that qcd factorization can be applicable to @xmath22 .    the diagram for the @xmath38 order qcd corrections to @xmath22 is plotted in fig .",
    "the fist two rows represents one - loop vertex corrections and @xmath38 corrections to electromagnetic , chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "the last row represents the hard spectator scattering . at present",
    ", we do nt know the wave function for a baryon with a quark and a diquark .",
    "one may use a meson like wave function , but a quantity like the decay constant is unknown .",
    "thus , we will neglect the hard spectator contributions .",

    "the weak decay of @xmath2 contains fruitful information of strong interaction and provides an important probe to test different theory approaches . in this work , we extend the qcd factorization approach to the heavy baryon decays , in particular the process of @xmath106 .",

    "the theory coincides with the experimental data @xmath111 very well .    from the coincidence of theory and experiment ,",
    "we can obtain some conclusions as following .",
    "( 1 ) the perturbative contribution is dominant .",
    "the success provides a confidence of applicability of qcd factorization method to the more complicated heavy baryon processes . ( 2 ) the choice of @xmath110 is appropriate .",
    "because the largest scale is @xmath112 in the @xmath89 quark decay subprocess , the real momentum transfer can not reach @xmath112 and should be smaller than it .",
    "( 3 ) the diquark ansatz works very well .",
    "the diquark approximation not only lead to a clear physics picture but also a great simplification for the numerical calculations . from this study and the previous literatures on heavy",
    "baryon decays , we may say that the diquark is really a working ansatz .",
    "the main theory uncertainties come from several origins : the choice of scale @xmath30 , the @xmath113 form factors , the neglected hard spectator interaction and the non - perturbative power corrections .",
    "the problem of scale @xmath30 has been discussed in the article .",
    "its scale dependence is not negligible .",
    "the higher loop corrections may help to reduce the dependence but are usually difficult to be realized .",
    "although the @xmath113 form factors depend on model calculations , the reliability can be fitted by experiemnt . in @xcite",
    ", it shows that our calculated @xmath113 form factors give a well prediction for @xmath114 : the theory result of the branching ratio is @xmath115 and the experimental data is @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the model - dependent form factors do nt cause large theoretical uncertainties .    for the meson case",
    ", the hard spectator scattering contributes a leading power correction .",
    "it modifies the wilson coefficient @xmath117 largely . for the coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 which is relevant to this study , the hard spectator correction is either numerically small ( about 10% ) or absent .",
    "thus , for the baryon case , the contribution from the hard spectator interaction is small .",
    "the weak annihilation contribution is power suppressed . at the realistic @xmath112 scale , it is necessary to consider its effect .",
    "the estimation of it suffers from the problem of end - point singularity .",
    "according to analysis in @xcite , the numerical values of annihilation correction is less than 25% compared to the leading power term .",
    "even this , the correction has included the chiral enhanced twist-3 contribution .",
    "for the baryon case , we might expect a similar small or even smaller weak annihilation contribution because no such chiral enhancement exist for the baryon of proton .",
    "the higher power correction is usually difficult to calculate .",
    "the consistence of theory at @xmath110 with data indicates that the non - perturbative power correction is less important and the perturbative contribution is dominant .",
    "one can use the data from @xmath120 to reduce the theory uncertainties in qcd factorization approach . by this way",
    ", we obtain the decay rate with @xmath121 which coincides the experiment very well .    about the cp violation , it provides us a very different physics picture . under the diquark approximation and neglecting the spectator interactions , the theory predicts cp violation at level of about 5% for both the baryon process @xmath106 and meson case @xmath120 .",
    "the origin of the strong phase in qcd factorization approach comes from the quark loop in the vertex corrections . for the meson case ,",
    "the theory result is positive .",
    "but the experiment data is negative , about @xmath122% .",
    "this obvious inconsistence implies the importance of non - perturbative corrections for cp violation .",
    "for the baryon @xmath106 , the experiment data gives a very large result : @xmath123 .",
    "in qcd factorization approach , the perturbative contribution can not reach 10% . because it s quite difficult to estimate the non - perturbative corrections , the prediction of cp violation in theory is a challenging research .",
    "we hope the future lhcb data can provide us a more precise measurement of cp violation in @xmath106 to improve the development of theory .",
