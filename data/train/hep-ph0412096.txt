    "traditionally , two - photon and high - energy photon - nucleon / nucleus interactions have been studied using electron beams .",
    "two - photon interactions have been studied at e@xmath0e@xmath1 colliders such as pep , petra , and lep .",
    "photon - proton interactions have been studied in fixed target experiments using electron beams and at the electron - proton collider hera .",
    "the interest in utilizing the strong photon flux associated with ultra - relativistic protons and nuclei to study these processes is , however , growing .",
    "see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadron and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators .",
    "these include the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , the fermilab tevatron , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the disadvantages are that it is not possible to tag the outgoing protons or nuclei , and that the interactions will always be restricted to low - virtuality photons .",
    "experimentally , triggering on photon induced interactions is also a challenge , since most experiments at hadron colliders so far have been constructed for studying hadronic interactions , which have a very different event topology .",
    "in the equivalent photon approximation , the effect of the electromagnetic field of a relativistic , charged particle is replaced by a flux of photons .",
    "the spectrum of photon energies , @xmath2 , may in principle extend up to the energy , @xmath3 , of the projectile but is in practice only significant at a small fraction , @xmath4 , of that .",
    "for an extended object , such as a proton or a nucleus , the energy spectrum can be calculated from @xcite : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the 4-momentum transfer from the projectile , which has a form factor @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we use units in which @xmath9 .",

    "equation  [ f_x ] may in principle be used also for the photon spectrum of relativistic heavy ions , with an appropriate form factor . for a collision between two heavy ions",
    "it is , however , more appropriate to calculate the spectrum of equivalent photons as a function of impact parameter@xcite .",
    "the advantage is that in this representation the contribution from interactions in which the ions interact hadronically can easily be excluded .",

    "all three approaches give results broadly similar to that of a point charge with a minimum impact parameter of @xmath28  0.7  fm ( dash - dotted curve in the figure ) .",
    "it should be noted that the spectra above are for a single proton . in a proton - proton ( @xmath29 )",
    "collision , the effective photon flux may be reduced if one requires both protons to remain intact and not interact hadronically .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in the effective photon spectrum .",
