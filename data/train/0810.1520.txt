    "thanks to recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity , it has been shown that the loss of linear momentum radiated away in the form of gravitational waves induces a large recoil velocity of the merged binary black hole . this would have been happened for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of galaxies , if two smbhs coalesce after a major galaxy merger . since the maximum velocity would reach @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the smbh could escape from its host galaxy .",
    "however , if the recoil velocity is a little smaller than the escape velocity of the galaxy , the smbh would orbit in the potential well of the galaxy for a long time .",
    "the identification of observational signatures of such recoiling smbhs is important for studies about the growth of black holes as well as the general relativity .",
    "in addition to direct detection of gravitational waves , a number of ideas have been proposed for detection of observational signatures of recoiling black holes through electromagnetic waves .",
    "@xcite indicated that stellar captures can lead to the formation of an accretion disk - star system about the smbh , and that the emission from the smbh could be observable . @xcite and @xcite argued that a recoiling smbh would be observed as an off - nuclear quasar until the gas carried by the smbh is depleted , although @xcite found no convincing evidence for recoiling smbhs carrying accretion disks in the sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "@xcite indicated that the displacement of a recoiling smbh transfers energy to the stars in the galactic nucleus and converts a steep density cusp into a core .",
    "@xcite discussed the influence of the merger and ejection of smbhs from the galactic centers on the relation of the black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite indicated that helical radio structures could be observed around a recoiling smbh because of the oscillation of the smbh in the core of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite showed that prompt shocks are created in the gas disk around a recoiling smbh and that the shocks could result in an afterglow , and the luminosity and characteristic photon energy increases with time .",
    "@xcite discussed that the smbh displacement may give rise to observable non - axisymmetries in the morphology and dynamics of the stellar and gaseous disk of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite examined the influence of a runaway smbh passage through intergalactic medium , and indicated that the smbh is able to ignite star formation efficiently in the wake of its trajectory .",
    "@xcite indicated that a recoiling smbh carries stars , and the electromagnetic flares from the stars that are tidally disrupted by the smbh would be observable .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated the trajectory of a smbh ejected in a smooth background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a gaseous disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and estimated the gas accretion rate onto the smbh as a function of time .",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) also calculated the trajectory of a smbh ejected in a realistic background potential of a disk galaxy .",
    "we calculated the accretion rate of gas onto the smbh from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galactic disk , and estimated the x - ray luminosity based on a model of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "we showed that the luminosity of the smbh can be comparable to or even larger than those of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) observed in galaxies ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , in that study , the effect of dynamical friction was not explicitly included .",
    "if dynamical friction is effective , the smbh gradually settles down to the galactic center .",
    "since the accretion rate depends on the density of the surrounding ism ( see equation  [ [ eq : dotm ] ] ) , we expect that the x - ray luminosity increases accordingly . in this paper",
    ", we study the long - term orbital and luminosity evolution of a recoiling smbh in a disk galaxy , considering the effect of dynamical friction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our models and choice of parameters are outlined in   [ sec : models ] .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in   [ sec : results ] and discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider smbh mergers in a normal disk galaxy for the sake of simplicity , although the galaxy interaction and merger supposedly affect the original disk .",
    "however , the process of the settling of smbhs between the galaxy merger and the set - in of effective emission of gravitational waves from the smbhs , which leads to the merger of the smbhs , has not been understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the time - scale of the smbh merger is long , the galaxy may be significantly relaxed when the recoil occurs @xcite .",
    "anyway , in order to follow the galaxy and smbh mergers self - consistently , we would need ultra - high resolution simulations of galaxy mergers that can resolve the settling of smbhs in the core of the merged galaxy .",
    "the model of a disk galaxy is the same as that in paper  i. the galaxy potential consists of three components , which are a @xcite disk , hernquist spheroid @xcite , and logarithmic halo @xcite : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 are cylindrical coordinates aligned with the galactic disk , and @xmath11 .",

    "for the spheroid and halo , we use the common @xmath37 and the velocity dispersion is @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the circulation velocities of the spheroid and halo , respectively @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar s formula for the dynamical friction force ( the second term in the right side of equation  [ [ eq : motion ] ] ) was derived assuming an infinite , homogeneous , and unchanging background .",
    "it is obviously not true for a smbh that is kicked out of the galactic center and orbiting in the disk galaxy .",
    "however , @xmath45-body simulations have shown that it can be applied to various cases if one chooses the coulomb logarithm appropriately . for a smbh ejected from the center of a spherically symmetric galaxy",

    "such @xmath45-body simulations have not been performed as far as we know . instead of a smbh , the evaluation of chandrasekhar s formula has been made for a dwarf galaxy infalling to a more massive disk galaxy .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath48 is appropriate .",
    "the small value of @xmath49 probably reflects the small ratio of the disk scale - height and the size of a dwarf galaxy , which corresponds to the ratio of maximum and minium effective impact parameters of particles that contribute to the friction force @xcite .",
    "however , since a smbh is a point source , we first assume that @xmath50 , which is the same as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and then change the value to see the influence of the uncertainty on results .",

    "most of the previous studies focused on stellar mass ( @xmath53 ) or intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ; @xmath54 ) . in this study , we consider the accretion on a recoiling smbh .    the accretion rate of the ism onto the smbh is given by the bondi - hoyle accretion @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the sound velocity of the ism .",

    "when @xmath56 and @xmath73 are given and @xmath94 is not fixed , the x - ray luminosity before the smbhs are affected by dynamical friction tends to be larger when @xmath94 is closer to @xmath79 , because their trajectories are included in the galactic disk , where @xmath92 is large .",
    "however , the tendency is not clear when @xmath105 , because their orbits are scattered in the asymmetric potential of the galaxy .",

    "we have found that a smbh that had been ejected from the center of a disk galaxy could be observed in the galactic disk with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath124 .",
    "the luminosity gradually increases as the smbh settles down to the galactic center through dynamical friction .    in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we follow the evolution until the smbh spirals down to @xmath125  pc . however , if @xmath86 is too small , the smbh can not be discriminated from the one that would have been sitting at the galactic center without being affected by a recoil .",

    "we also calculate the time age - corrected one ( @xmath129 ) . since @xmath128 and @xmath129 are derived by adding another condition @xmath127  kpc to @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively , it is natural that @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( table  [ tab : par ] ) .    as is mentioned in   [ sec : models ] , dynamical friction of a massive point particle orbiting in a disk galaxy has not been studied very much .",
    "thus , there is some uncertainty about the coulomb logarithm we should take .",
    "therefore , we change the value of @xmath49 to estimate the uncertainty .",
    "models c@xmath1342 and c@xmath1343 are respectively the same as models c2 and c3 except for @xmath49 . for these models , we set @xmath135 .",
    "table  [ tab : par ] shows that there is not much difference between the results of models  c2 and those of c@xmath1342 .",
    "this is because the maximum distances to the apocenters are @xmath136  kpc , where the spheroidal component is dominant , and the smbh is not much affected by the dynamical friction from the galactic disk . on the other hand , @xmath130 , @xmath123 , @xmath137 , and @xmath129 for models  c3 and c@xmath1343 are significantly different , because the smbh is ejected outside the spheroid .",
    "the differences are especially made by that of the orbits of @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath138 , the smbh is ejected in the galactic disk .",
    "if the dynamical friction from the disk is very effective , the smbh moves along with the disk ( @xmath139 ) and does not easily fall into the galactic center .",
    "this actually happens for model  c3 ( @xmath140  gyr when @xmath141 ; figure  [ fig : c3_90]a ) . in this case",
    ", the smbh continues to accrete the ism in the disk and is bright for a long time ( figure  [ fig : c3_90]b ) . since this smbh is very bright ( @xmath142 )",
    ", it could be easily observed if such smbhs actually exist . for model  c@xmath1343 ,",
    "the dynamical friction from the disk is not strong enough to hold back the smbh from the infall even when @xmath141 .",
    "we also consider the uncertainty of the ism fraction @xmath143 .",
    "model  c@xmath1443 is the same as model  c3 but for @xmath145 . for parameters we adopted ,",
    "the accretion efficiency is @xmath146 in most cases .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath147 ( equations  [ [ eq : dotm ] ] and  [ [ eq : lx ] ] ) , which means that the x - ray luminosity in model  c@xmath1443 is one fourth of that in model  c3 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath130 , @xmath123 , @xmath137 , and @xmath129 in model  c@xmath1443 are smaller than those in model  c3 , respectively",
    ". however , the differences are not large , because @xmath87 changes rapidly .    for comparison",
    ", we also investigate a model with a smaller initial velocity ( model  b0 ) , because we consider a milky - way type galaxy , which is generally expected to experience minor mergers rather than major mergers .",
    "in such cases , large recoil velocities as adopted above would not be common",
    ". a model with a larger smbh mass is also considered ( model  d3 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : orbitb0 ] and  [ fig : orbitd3 ] show the trajectories of the smbhs for models  b0 and d3 , respectively .",
    "their ejection angles are @xmath89 . in these models",
    ", @xmath73 is too small ( model  b0 ) , or @xmath56 is too large ( model  d3 ) for the smbh to be ejected from the spheroidal component of the galaxy .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to recognize them as recoiling smbhs , if their host galaxies are moderately distant .",
    "the smbhs are almost confined to the @xmath72-@xmath10 plane , because the dynamical friction from the spheroidal component overwhelms that from the galactic disk .",
    "table  [ tab : par ] shows that @xmath116 for models  b0 and d3 is relatively large because of small @xmath73 and large @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the smbhs set back to the galactic center in only several orbital periods ( @xmath148 and  0.07  gyr , respectively ) .",
    "since we have included the effect of dynamical friction when we consider the evolution of @xmath87 , we can constrain the probability to find smbhs with @xmath149 more precisely than paper  i. it has been estimated that for comparable mass binaries with dimensionless spin values of 0.9 , only @xmath150% of all mergers are expected to result in an ejection speed of @xmath151@xmath152 @xcite . since the ejection speed is smaller for mergers with large mass ratios and smaller spin values , the actual fraction would be smaller .",
    "although we consider the mergers of black holes with the masses currently observed at the centers of disk galaxies , it is unlikely that a galaxy would have undergone many mergers of black holes with such masses ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the number of such mergers that a galaxy has undergone would be @xmath153 .",
    "thus , since @xmath123 , @xmath154 ( table  [ tab : par ] ) , the probability that a disk galaxy has a traveling smbh with a luminosity comparable to or larger than that of ulxs is @xmath155 .",
    "since the probability is not so large , extensive surveys would be required to find the smbhs running in the galactic disks .",
    "in the future , it would be interesting to study whether the probability is larger than that of finding smbhs immediately after the ejection from the galactic centers with velocities of @xmath156(e.g . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the smbhs ejected into galactic disks are very bright ( figure  [ fig : c3_90]b ) , they could be observed even in distant galaxies . as was discussed in paper",
    "i , observations in bands other than x - rays would also be useful to detect the smbhs orbiting in disk galaxies and discriminate them from imbhs .",
    "we have investigated the trajectory of a smbh ejected from the galactic center through the emission of gravitational waves at the merger of two black holes .",
    "we included the effect of dynamical friction .",
