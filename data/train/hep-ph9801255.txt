    "top quark pairs produced in @xmath0 annihilation provide a very clean and kinematically well - defined source of top quarks . to leading order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath23 the energy of the top quark",
    "is exactly given by one - half of the center of mass energy .",
    "the top and antitop quarks decay so fast that there is no visible primary track .",
    "even if the energy of the top quark is constrained by the beam energy one has to rely on kinematical reconstruction from an analysis of the decay products in order to pin down the momentum direction of the primary top quark pairs .",
    "since to lowest order of qcd the top and antitop are produced exactly back - to - back , the lowest order anticollinearity provides for a further important kinematical constraint on the production kinematics .",
    "an exact knowledge of the momentum configuration of the primary produced top quark pairs is important for measurements of the spin observables of the top quark .",
    "if the top quark s momentum and momentum direction is known , one can boost to the rest frame of the top quark and do the spin analysis in the top quark rest system which is the optimal frame from the point of view of a spin analysis .",
    "as concerns spin  spin correlation effects , the anticollinearity of the produced top quark pairs is also important for optimizing spin ",
    "spin correlation measurements  @xcite .",
    "previously it has been emphasized that the bremsstrahlung of gluons off the top quark pairs can have important effects on various characteristics of the @xmath24 final state .",
    "for example , the mass determination of the top quark and the energy spectrum of secondary leptons will be affected by the presence of gluon bremsstrahlung  @xcite . in order to quantify the effect of gluon bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the authors of  @xcite have calculated the gluon energy spectrum in @xmath25 as well as the mean energy of the gluon @xmath26 .",
    "having in mind the above - mentioned spin analysis we continue in the study of gluon emission effects in @xmath25 and determine how the energy of the top ( or antitop ) quark is affected by gluon emission and how the anticollinearity of the top  antitop configuration is distorted by gluon emission .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we study the top energy spectrum and compare it to the bottom energy spectrum . from this",
    "we determine the mean deviation of the top and bottom energy @xmath1 from their lowest order value @xmath27 .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the mean quark energy @xmath28 is related to the mean gluon energy @xmath26 calculated in  @xcite .",
    "although this result is quite plausible at first sight it is nevertheless surprising since the calculation of the gluon s mean energy @xmath26 involves tree graph contributions only whereas one needs to bring in loop contributions for the determination of the quark s mean energy @xmath28 . in sec .",
    "3 we check on the rigidity of the back - to - back top quark pair configuration against gluon radiation by looking at opening angle distributions and their mean values .",
    "we determine the differential @xmath6-distribution where @xmath3 is the opening angle of the top quark pair and compare to the corresponding distribution in the bottom quark case .",
    "we then go on to calculate the mean deviations of @xmath6 and @xmath5 from the anticollinearity limits @xmath8 and @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "4 we study mean values of the longitudinal energy @xmath29 and the transverse energy @xmath30 of the top quark .",
    "the leading contributions to these measures are given by the mean energy @xmath28 calculated in sec .  2 and by the mean opening angle measures @xmath31 and @xmath32 calculated in sec .",
    "we also numerically evaluate the mean transverse momentum @xmath33 of the top quark relative to the antitop direction and the mean of the opening angle itself .",

    "a we list explicit formulas for the full @xmath34 heavy quark production cross section which enter in the evaluation of the mean values as denominator functions . in appendix",
    "b we list a number of basic rate functions which appear in our analytical results . in appendix",
    "c we present analytical results on first moment integrals that are needed for the evaluation of the mean values of @xmath28 and @xmath31 for scalar and pseudoscalar current - induced top pair production .",
    "to begin with we express the differential heavy quark production cross section in @xmath35 with @xmath36 in terms of the relevant components of the hadron tensor @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fractional energy loss variables for the heavy quark and antiquark .",

    "@xmath147 rises smoothly from threshold to a value of @xmath148 at @xmath9 and further to @xmath22 at @xmath19 .",
    "a good estimate of @xmath147 can be obtained by inverting the corresponding numerical values for @xmath32 in table  [ tab1 ] which gives @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively . using instead @xmath128 for",
    "the corresponding estimate one obtains @xmath198 and @xmath199 which considerably overestimates the true values of @xmath147 .",
    "the reason that @xmath32 gives a good estimate of the mean of the acollinearity angle @xmath147 can again be traced to the fact that the weight factor @xmath5 ( considered as function of @xmath6 ) has a strong support close to the ir - point @xmath8 .",
    "up to now we have been separately considering the energy loss of the quark and the deviation of the acollinearity angle @xmath3 from the anticollinearity limit @xmath200 due to gluon radiation . from the physics point of view",
    "it is also interesting to consider the energy loss of the quark projected in the longitudinal direction as well as the build - up of transverse energy resulting from gluon radiation . here",
    "the longitudinal and transverse energies are defined relative to the momentum direction of the antiquark and are thus defined by @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "again we shall calculate mean values of these two quantities as a measure of the importance of gluon radiation . as before we rewrite @xmath185 and @xmath203 in terms of tree - graph ir - safe measures . for the mean longitudinal energy one",

    "( [ eqn19 ] ) must satisfy three geometrical inequalities which follow from the geometrical inequalities @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "since these inequalities are true on an event - by - event basis they must also hold for their means .",
    "one can check that the relevant numerical entries in table  [ tab1 ] satisfy the three inequalities . on top of the geometrical inequalities one may classify the mean values of the different weight variables in eq .",
    "( [ eqn19 ] ) in terms of powers of smallness since the differential cross section is strongly peaked towards the ir - region .",
    "thus one expects that the leading contributions to @xmath185 come from the linear terms @xmath128 and @xmath95 whereas the quadratically small term @xmath131 is expected to be a nonleading effect .",
    "this qualitative picture is borne out by the numerical values in table  [ tab1 ] and by the curves in fig .",
    "5a where the energy dependence of the above mean values are combined in one common plot .",
    "the mean of the fractional transverse energy @xmath210 can be written as @xmath211.\\ ] ] one now has the geometrical inequality @xmath212 which can be seen to be satisfied by the relevant numerical entries in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the leading contribution is expected to arise from the linear term @xmath32 whereas the contribution of the term @xmath137 is nonleading .",
    "the numerical values in table  [ tab1 ] as well as the relevant curves in fig .",
    "5b confirm this picture .    even though we do not present numerical results for the bottom production case we list the high energy limits of the mean values @xmath131 , @xmath32 and @xmath137 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn19 ] ) and  ( [ eqn20 ] ) for the sake of completenes .",
    "including also the result eq .",
    "( [ eqn17 ] ) one has @xmath213 where applicable the limiting values can be seen to satisfy the geometrical inequalities written down before .",
    "the limiting values show the same hierarchy in terms of powers of smallness as discussed before for top production below @xmath19 .",
    "however , the hierarchy is not as pronounced as in the top production case below @xmath19 . as concerns the limiting values in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn21 ] ) we want to add two remarks . in the mass zero limit treated above the transverse energy of the quark",
    "is equal to its transverse momentum .",
    "also the mean of the longitudinal energy @xmath185 and the longitudinal fractional energy loss @xmath134 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn18 ] ) and  ( [ eqn19 ] ) are mass singular as manifested by the contribution of @xmath109 to @xmath185 and @xmath134 which by itself is mass singular ( see sec .  2 ) .",
    "as table  [ tab1 ] shows , gluon radiation causes an average energy loss of 1.06% of the top quark s energy in the longitudinal direction and an average energy gain of 1.88% in the transverse direction at this energy . at @xmath19 the corresponding percentage figures are 5.19% and 6.06% .",
    "this has to be compared with the total energy loss of @xmath13 at @xmath9 and @xmath16 at @xmath19 as calculated in sec .",
    "the gain in transverse energy is larger than the loss of longitudinal energy in this energy range where this effect becomes smaller as the center of mass energy increases .",
    "qualitatively this behaviour may be understood from what is referred to as the `` dead - cone '' effect of gluon emission from a heavy quark  @xcite .",
    "gluon emission is suppressed in an angular cone of size @xmath214 around the quark ",
    "antiquark direction , i.e.  the emitted gluon has a strong momentum component transverse to the quark ",
    "antiquark direction .",
    "because of momentum conservation the transverse momentum of the gluon has to be balanced by the transverse momentum of the quark .",
    "a good estimate of the fractional transverse momentum of the heavy quark in the energy region under consideration can be obtained by rescaling @xmath215 by the factor @xmath216 where @xmath122 is the lowest order momentum of the quark ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "taking the rescaled values of @xmath140 and comparing it to the mean fractional total energy of the gluon @xmath141 in table  [ tab1 ] one concludes from momentum conservation that , on average , the gluon must have a large transverse momentum or energy component . by comparing the relevant numbers at @xmath195 and",
    "@xmath19 one notes that this effect becomes smaller as the energy is raised in agreement with the shrinking of the `` dead - cone '' predicted in  @xcite .",
    "in order to get a more quantitative handle on the `` dead - cone '' effect we show a plot of the @xmath217-dependence of the mean fractional gluon energy ( or momentum ) @xmath218 and the mean fractional transverse momentum @xmath219 of the top in fig .  7 . in the whole range from threshold",
    "up to @xmath19 the mean transverse momentum of the top quark is almost balanced by the mean total momentum of the gluon where the approximate equality of the two means degrades as the energy increases .",
    "this proofs that the emitted gluon has a dominant transverse momentum component , and that the preference for transverse emission is degraded as the energy increases , just as expected from the `` dead - cone '' effect .",
    "we have discussed in some detail how gluon radiation affects the lowest order back - to - back configuration of pair produced top quarks in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "we have introduced various measures that serve to quantify gluon radiation effects in this reaction and we have studied their energy dependence .",
    "these measures are related to the overall energy loss and the energy loss in the longitudinal direction , or , in the case of the transverse energy , to the energy gain in the transverse direction .",
    "we have also introduced two angular measures related to the opening angle @xmath3 between quark and antiquark .    when possible we have given analytical expressions for the energy and momentum measures @xmath28 , @xmath203 , @xmath185 and @xmath220 and for the angular measures @xmath128 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have provided numerical results for all these measures in the energy range from close to top ",
    "antitop threshold up to @xmath19 .",
    "for some of the measures we have compared the top  antitop results to the corresponding figures for bottom pair production including a discussion of the high energy limit @xmath77 limits of the various measures",
    ". the numerical predictions and their energy dependence can directly be compared to experimental data on top pair production at the proposed future linear colliders .",
    "the values of these measures also serve to quantify the effect of gluon radiation on the lowest order back - to - back configuration of the produced top quark pairs .",
    "compared to the lowest order energy of the top @xmath221 the mean loss of longitudinal energy is smaller than the mean gain in transverse energy in the range of c.m .",
    "energies from threshold to @xmath19 . at @xmath9",
    "the mean transverse energy exceeds the mean longitudinal energy loss by about a factor of two . in this sense",
    "the top quark is more rigid in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction .",
    "this behaviour can be traced to an effect which is referred to as the `` dead - cone '' effect in the literature . in massive quark pair production with additional gluon radiation the gluon tends to be emitted away from the heavy quark and antiquark directions .",
    "since the mean momentum of the gluon is comparatively large ( @xmath222 ) and since the transverse momentum of the gluon has to be balanced by the transverse motion of the quark ( or antiquark ) one obtains comparatively large values for the mean transverse energy and momentum of the quark ( or antiquark ) .",

    "the paper self - contained we list the results in this appendix .",
