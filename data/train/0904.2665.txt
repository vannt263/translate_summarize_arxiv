    "the study of the hadronic final state in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) allows the determination of aspects of the nucleon structure which are not accessible in inclusive scattering as well as testing predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to a high accuracy . in particular",
    ", the two - plus - one - jet production  @xcite rate in dis can be used both to probe the gluon distribution and to enable a precise determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "the measurement  @xcite of these jet observables at the electron - proton collider hera , with a much larger kinematical range than at earlier fixed target experiments , allows precision studies , and the inclusion of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections  @xcite has become mandatory .",
    "however , the present data already highlight the limitations of the nlo description : the error on the extraction of @xmath7 from hera ( 2 + 1 ) jet data is dominated  @xcite not by the statistical uncertainty on the data , but by the uncertainty inherent to the nlo calculation , as estimated by varying renormalization and factorization scales . given that the statistical precision of the data will further improve once all data from the hera - ii run are analysed , the theoretical description requires the inclusion of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , i.e.  @xmath8 , corrections .",
    "the dijet production cross section in deep inelastic scattering at hera is very sensitive to the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "however , present determinations of parton distribution functions  @xcite at nnlo accuracy  @xcite can only include data sets for observables where nnlo corrections are known  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the precise hera deep inelastic dijet data could be used in global nnlo determinations only once the nnlo qcd corrections to this observable are computed .    in terms of matrix elements , the calculation of these corrections requires the computation of three contributions : the tree level @xmath9  partons amplitudes , the one - loop corrections to the @xmath10  partons amplitudes and the two - loop corrections to the @xmath11  partons amplitudes , where @xmath12 .",
    "all of these amplitudes can be obtained by analytic continuation from the respective amplitudes contributing to @xmath13  jets at nnlo : the tree level @xmath14  partons  @xcite , the one - loop corrections to the @xmath15  partons amplitudes  @xcite , and the two - loop corrections to the @xmath16  partons amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of the tree level and one - loop amplitudes is rather straightforward , it has already been carried out in the context of the nlo corrections to the @xmath17-jet rate in dis  @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of the two - loop amplitudes is more involved and is the topic of the present paper .",
    "corrections to the deep inelastic @xmath3-jet cross section , which are the phenomenologically most relevant applications , require only the computation of the helicity averaged squared matrix element .",
    "however , the helicity amplitudes derived here can be applied to compute angular correlations between the outgoing lepton direction and the orientation of the @xmath3-jet system  @xcite .",
    "they also allow the calculation of jet cross sections in polarized lepton - nucleon collisions  @xcite which can constrain the polarized parton distributions in the nucleon .    even though the matrix elements for all nnlo partonic subprocesses contributing to @xmath3-jet final states in dis are now available , additional work is still needed before quantitative predictions can be made .",
    "the two - loop amplitudes computed here must be combined with the one - loop corrections to @xmath18  partons , where one of the partons becomes collinear or soft , as well as tree - level processes @xmath19  partons with two soft or collinear partons in a way that explicitly allows all of the infrared singularities to cancel one another .",
    "this task is usually accomplished by a subtraction method , which exploits the universal factorization properties of qcd amplitudes in infrared soft or collinear limits to construct real radiation subtraction terms .",
    "these subtraction terms approximate the full real radiation matrix elements in all unresolved limits , but are sufficiently simple to be integrated analytically .",
    "consequently , they can be combined with the virtual loop corrections to the matrix elements to yield infrared finite results for suitably defined observables .",
    "several general subtraction schemes have been proposed at nlo  @xcite .    for observables with only final state partons ,",
    "an nnlo subtraction formalism , antenna subtraction , has been established in  @xcite .",
    "the antenna subtraction formalism constructs the subtraction terms from antenna functions , which are derived systematically from physical matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been applied in the computation of nnlo corrections to three - jet production in electron - positron annihilation  @xcite and related event shapes  @xcite .",
    "this formalism can be extended to include parton showers at higher orders  @xcite , thereby offering a process independent matching of fixed - order calculations and logarithmic resummations  @xcite , which had to be done on a case - by - case basis for individual observables  @xcite up to now . for processes with inital - state partons ,",
    "antenna subtraction has been fully worked out only to nlo so far  @xcite , work towards an extension to nnlo is in progress .    other approaches to perform nnlo calculations of exclusive observables with initial state partons are the use of sector decomposition and a subtraction method based on the transverse momentum structure of the final state .",
    "the sector decomposition algorithm  @xcite analytically decomposes both phase space and loop integrals into their laurent expansion in dimensional regularization , and performs a subsequent numerical computation of the coefficients of this expansion . using this formalism",
    ", nnlo results were obtained for higgs production  @xcite and vector boson production  @xcite at hadron colliders . both reactions",
    "were equally computed independently using an nnlo subtraction formalism exploiting the specific transverse momentum structure of these observables  @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : kin ] , we describe the kinematical situation relevant to dis-@xmath3-jet production .",
    "the two - loop helicity amplitudes are computed by analytic continuation from the @xmath20  partons amplitudes in section  [ sec : helicity ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "[ sec : kin ]    the partonic subprocesses contributing to the production of two hard jets ( besides the current jet ) in dis are lepton  quark scattering @xmath21 ( with lepton - antiquark scattering following trivially from charge conjugation ) and lepton  gluon scattering @xmath22 the momentum of the vector boson mediating the interaction is given by @xmath23    it is convenient to define the invariants @xmath24 which fulfil @xmath25 as well as the dimensionless invariants @xmath26 which satisfy @xmath27 .    in @xmath28  jet ( @xmath29 )",
    "production , @xmath30 is time - like ( hence positive ) and all the @xmath31 are also positive , which implies that @xmath32 all lie in the interval @xmath33 $ ] , with the above constraint @xmath27 . for dis-@xmath34 production ,",
    "@xmath30 is space - like ( hence negative ) and for lepton ",
    "quark scattering ( [ eq : lqkin ] ) the invariants fulfil @xmath35 or , equivalently , @xmath36 for lepton  gluon scattering ( [ eq : lgkin ] ) , one finds @xmath37 respectively , @xmath38 it is worth noting that the kinematical regions for these two processes are further subdivided by cuts in @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( lepton  quark scattering ) or @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( lepton  gluon scattering ) , as was first pointed out by graudenz in the context of the calculation of the nlo matrix elements  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to find an analytic expression for the amplitudes , which covers the whole kinematic region _ and _ does not contain functions with implicit imaginary parts .",
    "we shall see below that the most convenient representation is obtained by subdividing the kinematical plane for each process according to the cuts into four sectors . in each of these sectors",
    ", we obtain an analytic expression for the amplitudes with all imaginary parts made explicit ; joining the different regions together , one obtains a result which is continuous , but not analytic , across the cuts .",
    "the renormalized amplitude @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 represents the lepton current and @xmath44 denotes the hadron current . with @xmath45 ,",
    "we denote the incoming quark ( momentum @xmath46 ) in lepton  quark scattering or the outgoing antiquark ( momentum @xmath47 ) in lepton ",
    "gluon scattering .",
    "a convenient method to evaluate the helicity amplitudes is in terms of weyl  van der waerden spinors , which is described briefly in the appendix of  @xcite and in detail in @xcite .    using the weyl ",
    "van der waerden spinor calculus , we can express the lepton current @xmath48 for photon exchange in terms of the helicities of the incoming @xmath49 and outgoing @xmath50 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath51 where for photon exchange , @xmath52 it is straightforward to account for charged and neutral current exchange by appropriate replacement of the couplings , keeping in mind that in these cases left- and right - handed couplings are no longer identical .",
    "the lepton current for incident anti - leptons follows from charge conjugation .",
    "the hadronic current @xmath53 is related to the fixed helicity currents , @xmath54 , by @xmath55 @xmath56 as above , the gauge boson coupling is extracted from @xmath54 , and charged and neutral current reactions follow from appropriate substitutions .",
    "the currents with the quark helicities flipped follow from parity conservation : @xmath57 charge conjugation implies the following relations between currents with different helicities : @xmath58 all helicity amplitudes are therefore related to the amplitudes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "explicitly , we find @xmath61 the other helicity amplitudes are obtained from @xmath62 by the above parity and charge conjugation relations .",
    "current conservation implies the following relation between the four helicity coefficients , @xmath63 equation  ( [ eq : deltadef ] ) suffices to fix @xmath64 .",
    "the three remaining helicity amplitude coefficients @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are vectors in colour space and have perturbative expansions : @xmath68 \\;,\\nonumber \\\\\\ ] ] for @xmath69 where the dependence on @xmath70 is implicit .",
    "the helicity coefficients were extracted from a feynman diagram calculation in dimensional regularization  @xcite , with @xmath71 space - time dimensions , by applying suitable projectors to the amplitudes at the required order in perturbation theory . once these projectors are applied to expose the helicity structure , one is left with the task of computing a large number of two - loop integrals . using integration - by - parts  @xcite and lorentz - invariance  @xcite identities , these were reduced  @xcite ( making extensive use of maple  @xcite and form  @xcite ) to a small number of so - called master integrals , which were derived in  @xcite .",
    "insertion of these master integrals into the contraction of feynman amplitudes with the projectors then yields the unrenormalized helicity amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "a partial check was made in  @xcite , where two of the seven colour factors contributing to the @xmath20  partons two - loop helicity amplitudes were derived by direct evaluation of the integrals ( i.e.  not using a reduction to master integrals ) , yielding full agreement with  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 amplitudes obtained in  @xcite are expressed in terms of two - dimensional harmonic polylogarithms ( 2dhpls ) .",
    "the 2dhpls are an extension of the harmonic polylogarithms ( hpls ) of  @xcite .",
    "numerical routines providing an evaluation of the hpls  @xcite and 2dhpls  @xcite are available .",
    "the implementations apply to hpls of arbitrary real  @xcite or complex  @xcite arguments , but only for a limited range of arguments of the 2dhpls .",
    "this range of arguments corresponds precisely to the @xmath29 kinematics .",
    "formulae for the analytic continuation of hpls and 2dhpls to ranges of argument relevant to all @xmath72 scattering kinematics were derived in  @xcite . given the restricted range of arguments for the numerical implementation of the 2dhpls  @xcite , in  @xcite transformations to map all @xmath72 scattering kinematics into this range of arguments were derived .",
    "these analytical continuations were subsequently confirmed by direct numerical evaluation  @xcite of the relevant master integrals  @xcite in the relevant kinematical regions using the numerical mellin - barnes technique . using the results of  @xcite",
    ", we can perform the analytic continuation of all the unrenormalized helicity amplitudes from the @xmath20  partons kinematics considered in  @xcite to the kinematical situation of dis-@xmath3-jet production .",
    "subsequently , renormalization is performed in the @xmath73-scheme by replacing the bare coupling @xmath74 with the renormalized coupling @xmath75 , evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath76 @xmath77\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the mass parameter introduced in dimensional regularization  @xcite to maintain a dimensionless coupling in the bare qcd lagrangian density ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the first two coefficients of the qcd @xmath66-function : @xmath82 with the qcd colour factors @xmath83 for the remainder of this paper we will set the renormalization scale @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure yields the renormalized tensor coefficients , @xmath85 the full scale dependence of the renormalized helicity coefficients can be recovered from the renormalization group equation : @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu^2)}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\bigg[\\omega^{(2 ) }   + \\biggl(\\frac{3\\beta_0}{2}\\omega^{(1 ) } + \\frac{\\beta_1}{2}\\omega^{(0 ) } \\biggr )   \\ln\\left({\\mu^2\\over q^2}\\right )    + \\frac{3 \\beta_0 ^ 2}{8 } \\omega^{(0 ) }    \\ln^2\\left({\\mu^2\\over q^2}\\right)\\bigg ]   + { \\cal o}(\\alpha_s^3 ) \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after performing ultraviolet renormalization , the amplitudes still contain singularities , which are of infrared origin and will be analytically cancelled by those occurring in radiative processes of the same order .",
    "catani  @xcite has shown how to organize the infrared pole structure of the one- and two - loop contributions renormalized in the  scheme in terms of the tree and renormalized one - loop amplitudes .",
    "the same procedure applies to the tensor coefficients : @xmath87 where the constant @xmath88 is @xmath89 for this particular process , there is only one colour structure present at tree level which , in terms of the gluon colour @xmath90 and the quark and antiquark colours @xmath91 and @xmath92 , is simply @xmath93 . adding higher loops does not introduce additional colour structures , and the amplitudes are therefore vectors in a one - dimensional space .",
    "similarly , the infrared singularity operator @xmath94 is a scalar in colour space and is given by @xmath95\\ ; , \\label{eq : i1}\\ ] ] where ( since we have set @xmath96 ) @xmath97 using the invariants @xmath31 as defined in section  [ sec : kin ] , phase factors distinguishing initial and final state partons become obsolete in this expression .",
    "note that on expanding @xmath98 , imaginary parts are generated , the sign of which is fixed by the small imaginary part @xmath99 of all @xmath31 .    finally , the term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : polesa ] ) that involves @xmath100 produces only a single pole in @xmath101 and is given by @xmath102 where the constant @xmath103 is renormalization - scheme - dependent . as with the single - pole parts of @xmath94 ,",
    "the process - dependent @xmath103 can be constructed by counting the number of radiating partons present in the event . in our case , in the  scheme : @xmath104    at leading order @xmath105 the renormalized next - to - leading order helicity amplitude coefficients can be straightforwardly obtained to all orders in @xmath101 from the known exact expressions for the one - loop master integrals . for practical purposes , they are needed through to @xmath106 in evaluating the infrared - divergent one - loop contribution to the two - loop amplitude , while only the finite piece is needed for the one - loop self - interference .",
    "they can be decomposed according to their colour structure as follows : @xmath107 the expansion of the coefficients through to @xmath108 yields hpls and 2dhpls up to weight 4 for @xmath109 , @xmath110 and up to weight 3 for @xmath111 . in order to obtain expressions",
    "suitable for numerical evaluation ( which requires the arguments of the 2dhpls to be in a restricted range ) and to make all imaginary parts explicit , we use the following decomposition  @xcite for the coefficients @xmath112 of the individual colour factors : @xmath113 for the lepton ",
    "quark scattering process ( [ eq : lqkin ] ) and @xmath114 for the lepton ",
    "gluon scattering process ( [ eq : lgkin ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath115 are then expressed in terms of hpls of argument @xmath116 and 2dhpls of argument @xmath117 , with @xmath116 featuring in the index vector .",
    "the above choices of argument ensure that @xmath118 and @xmath119 , as required for the numerical evaluation of the 2dhpls  @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions are of considerable size , such that we shall not quote them here .",
    "an example of the size and structure of those coefficients can be found in  @xcite , where we explicitly list the helicity - averaged one - loop times one - loop and tree times two - loop matrix elements for @xmath13  jets .",
    "it should be noted that these finite pieces of the one - loop coefficients can equally well be written in terms of ordinary logarithms and dilogarithms , see  @xcite .",
    "the reason for expressing them in terms of hpls and 2dhpls here is their usage in the infrared counter - term of the two - loop coefficients , which can not be fully expressed in terms of logarithmic and polylogarithmic functions .",
    "the finite two - loop remainder is obtained by subtracting the predicted infrared structure ( expanded through to @xmath120 ) from the renormalized helicity coefficient .",
    "we further decompose the finite remainder according to the colour structure , as follows : @xmath121 where the last term is generated by graphs where the virtual gauge boson does not couple directly to the final - state quarks .",
    "this contribution is denoted by @xmath122 and is proportional to the charge weighted sum of the quark flavours . in the case of purely electromagnetic interactions we find , @xmath123 including electroweak vector boson interactions , the same class of diagrams yields not only a contribution from the vector component ( obtained by appropriate replacement of the couplings in the above formula  @xcite ) , but also a contribution involving the axial couplings of the vector boson under consideration",
    "this contribution vanishes however if summed over isospin doublets .",
    "we apply the same decomposition as used at one loop for the coefficients @xmath124 of the individual colour factors : @xmath125 for the lepton ",
    "quark scattering process ( [ eq : lqkin ] ) and @xmath126 for the lepton ",
    "gluon scattering process ( [ eq : lgkin ] ) .",
    "the helicity coefficients contain hpls and 2dhpls up to weight 4 in the @xmath127-terms , up to weight 3 in the @xmath128-terms and up to weight 2 in the @xmath129-term .",
    "the size of each helicity coefficient is comparable to the size of the helicity - averaged tree times two - loop matrix element quoted in  @xcite .",
    "we therefore refrain from quoting them explicitly .",
    "the complete set of one - loop and two - loop coefficients in form and fortran format is provided with the sources of the paper on the archive http://arxiv.org .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the analytic continuation procedures for two - loop four - point functions with one off - shell leg derived in  @xcite to obtain the two - loop helicity amplitudes relevant to dis-(2 + 1 )  jet production from the amplitudes for @xmath130 derived earlier .",
    "besides enabling the computation of the virtual two - loop corrections to the dis-(2 + 1 )  jet cross section and related event shape observables ( which follow by interfering the amplitudes with their tree level counterparts and summing over all external helicities ) , knowledge of the helicity amplitudes provides additional information about the scattering process .",
    "in particular , oriented event shapes as well as jet rates in polarized dis can be computed from them .",
    "these matrix elements represent one of the missing ingredients for nnlo computations of deep inelastic jet production .",
    "such calculations require the construction of a parton - level event generator program , which contains all partonic channels contributing to the observable under consideration .",
    "since the one - loop and tree - level contributions at nnlo contain more partons than hard jets , they will contribute infrared real radiation singularities , which have to be subtracted in the corresponding partonic channels , and added to the two - loop virtual contribution to yield finite expressions suitable for numerical evaluation . while a formalism for nnlo subtraction is well established for processes involving only final - state partons , some extra work is required to subtract singularities arising from unresolved emission off initial - state partons . work in this direction",
    "is ongoing .",
