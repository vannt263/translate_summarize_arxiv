    "lots of works focus on the dynamics of an infectious disease depending on the structure of population .",
    "there are two kinds of classical ways to analyze this phenomenon in theoretics : consider the structure of population to be well mixed populations@xcite or spatially extended subpolulations@xcite . but both of them do not match the real populations very well .",
    "the real world is neither well mixed nor lattices .",
    "recently , large amounts of statistics have suggested that the ideal model of the social network should be `` small world '' model . introduced by watts and strogatzwatts , small world networks attempt to translate , into abstract model , the complex topology of social interactions .",
    "small worlds may play an important role in the study of the influence of the network structure upon the dynamics of many social processes such as disease spreading , biological metabolizing , etc@xcite .",
    "however , in most of these works , only the static small world networks were considered , which means the connections in the network keep unchanged during the process@xcite .",
    "the social processes are dynamic and the social interactions are changing with time .",
    "every individual has a tendency to change its original contact with its acquaintances and establish new relationship with others every day .",
    "therefore , the study of dynamic network becomes essential .    using a newly - introduced parameter",
    "`` moving probability '' to depict this tendency , we simulated the spread of epidemic disease in small world networks under different moving conditions , and found that the moving ability of a network has a great influence on the spreading speed .",
    "small world network model was put forward by watts and strogatz in 1998 . to adjust a single parameter @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , we can get gradually changing networks ranging from a regular lattice to a completely random graph . in this model",
    "the parameter @xmath3 characterizes the degree of disorder of the network .",
    "its algorithm is as follows : firstly , start with a ring lattice with @xmath6 nodes in which every node is connected to its first @xmath7 neighbors ( @xmath8 on each side ) .",
    "secondly , every link connecting a node to a neighbor is then randomly rewired to any other vertex of the system with the probability @xmath3 .",
    "however , self connections and duplicate edges are excluded . by varying @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5",
    ", we can see the network evolute from a regular network to a completely random network progressively .",
    "we make these small world networks motive through the following steps : firstly , construct a new small world network with the same probability @xmath3 as a template . then use a moving probability @xmath0 to decide whether a connection between two nodes should be reconnected or not .",
    "if a pair of nodes should be reconnected , let them reconnect as what they do in the template networks .",
    "for some node pairs have the same connection status in both original network and template network , they will keep the same status after moving .",
    "therefore the `` real '' moving probability of our random network model is @xmath9 .",
    "the new network we get is different from the original one but it keeps small - world properties .",
    "the interactions between the elements of the population are described by a small world network .",
    "the links represent the contact between subjects , and infection can only diffuse through them . according to the realistic spreading of most kinds of epidemic diseases ( such as sars ) , they usually have three stages : susceptible(@xmath10 ) , infected(@xmath11 ) , and refractory(@xmath12 ) .",
    "this is what the system , usually called as @xmath1 , essentially means : the health condition of each individual is described by a single dynamical variable adopting one of these three values . through contagion by an infected one , susceptible elements can pass to the infected state . and after an infection time @xmath13",
    ", infected elements pass to the refractory state , which means that the infected ones are detected and then isolated in quarantine .",
    "refractory elements return to the susceptible state after a recovery time @xmath14",
    ". we call it as sirs for the cycle that a single element goes over .",
    "the contagion is possible only during the @xmath15 phase , and only by an @xmath11 element . during the @xmath12 phase ,",
    "the elements are immune and do not infect .",
    "so each element is characterized by a time counter @xmath16 , describing its phase in the cycle of the disease@xcite .",
    "the epidemiological state @xmath17 of the element ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) depends on this phase in the following way:@xmath18 \\\\ \\pi _ { i}(t ) & = & r\\hspace{1cm}if\\ \\tau _ { i}(t)\\in [ \\tau _ { i}+1,\\tau _ { 0 } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the state of an element in the next step depends on its current phase in the cycle , and the states of its neighbors in the network .",
    "the rules of evolution are the following:@xmath19    with the fast development of modern vehicles , people are inclined to changing their links with the original neighbors and establishing new contact with others .",
    "accordingly , another parameter @xmath0 is introduced here to characterize the  moving inclination \" of individuals .",
    "the networks move , i.e. change their original structures , with time processing ,    using the small world network model characterized by the sirs mechanism , we simulated the propagation of the epidemic disease in the population with different @xmath0 .",
    "we performed the numerical simulations on network with @xmath20 to @xmath21 vertices and with @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "what we noticed is the initial stage of the infection .",
    "normally , at the initial stage , the number of infected elements grows in an exponential way.@xmath24where @xmath25 is the characteristic time of the growth . in the simulations",
    ", we found the characteristic time decreases fast with the increase of moving probability @xmath0 .",
    "the results are similar when disorder parameter @xmath3 varies in a proper range .    in order to get the characteristic time from numerical simulations creditably",
    ", the time of the exponential growth should be long enough .",
    "for this purpose , in our results given below we set the disorder parameter as @xmath26 , the nodes number as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the initial infected fraction @xmath29 is @xmath30 .    .",
    "on the right , we see the number of infected elements is an approximate exponential function of time : @xmath31 . and the small - scale graph shows the relation between @xmath32 and t. here @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "other parameters are : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . , title=\"fig : \" ] . on the right",
    ", we see the number of infected elements is an approximate exponential function of time : @xmath31 . and",
    "the small - scale graph shows the relation between @xmath32 and t. here @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "other parameters are : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we show in fig.1 three time series displaying the number of infected elements in the system as a function of time .",
    "the curves correspond to systems with different values of the moving parameter : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "they have infection cycles with @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the result of @xmath42 days are shown .",
    "we can see clearly that after a short period of time the number of infected elements begins an approximately exponential growth with time increasing .    at @xmath38 , where the network is relatively reluctant to change its structure , the plot accords with the exponential fit exactly and keeps increasing till up to the last day .",
    "however , at @xmath43 , where the network it represents becomes more  active \" and changeable , it grows more rapidly with time and then , after the peak , enters a plateau .",
    "similarly , at @xmath44 , which means the most active network , it grows fast with time first and then becomes constant at the day even earlier than the former one does .",
    "we also give out the relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and then we see clearly the dependence of the growth of the infected people on time . in the left small - scale graphs in fig.1 ,",
    "we compare the growth characters of the three different @xmath0 . in the first several days when infection begins , the three curves have almost the same slope .",
    "that is because initially the number of infected elements is very small . at this time",
    "the disease is not widely distributed , which is closely related to the mutual contact between individuals .",
    "thus the three have almost the same growth rate with time despite of their different @xmath0 . after this period ,",
    "the three curves demonstrate different growth slopes .",
    "this is because the larger @xmath47 a network has , the quicker rate it has to change its structure , which leads to the more rapid spreading of the disease .",
    "at last , the upper two curves become  flat \" , which mean that the epidemic spreading approaches saturated state . in the right small - scale one , wiping off the first several days and the plateau stage , the curve of @xmath38 fits linear growth very well .",
    "then @xmath48 in the following analysis , we take only the exponential growing stages into account .     as a function of @xmath0 : @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is a constant .",
    "each point corresponds to the average of @xmath51 realizations .",
    "the line is of exponential decay fit .",
    "the formula is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the characteristic moving probability .",
    "other parameters are @xmath28 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ]    one can see that in the @xmath60 scale figure , in the exponential growth stage , the characteristic times of @xmath61 and of @xmath43 are almost the same , but much smaller than the characteristic time of @xmath38 .",
    "it means when the moving probability @xmath0 is large enough , the characteristic time of infection will converge .    from these results we see the epidemic spreading depends closely on the moving probability of a social network",
    "to analyze their relationship more clearly , we extract in different @xmath0 the time spans during which the plot growth accords with time exponentially and record their characteristic time @xmath25",
    ". then we find that the characteristic time grow as an exponential decay function of their respective moving probabilities in fig 2 .",
    "@xmath62where @xmath63 is the characteristic time when the moving probability is very larger ; @xmath64 is a characteristic moving probability and @xmath65 is the characteristic time when the network is static .",
    "therefore , the spreading speed of the infection increases exponentially when the network begins to move .",
    "one should be noted that the characteristic moving probability @xmath64 ( @xmath66 with parameters given above ) is very small , which means that once a little freedom given to the network to vary its connection , the infection speed increases markedly .",
    "what is the inner mechanism in it that leads to this kind of functional relationship between them and to what extent does this mechanism play its role ? we tried to explore this problem and analyzed these simulated results .    ] as a function of @xmath67 ; three curves under different @xmath0 are given .",
    "$ ] is the number of healthy ones who contact with @xmath67 infected ones on the day when they have the same number of infected people . here",
    "the curve @xmath69 is the one with @xmath0=0.0001 , @xmath70 with @xmath0=0.008 , and @xmath71 with @xmath43 .",
    "we only show the curves from @xmath67=1 to 6 . in the small - scale graph",
    ", we show the @xmath68 $ ] with respect to @xmath67 from 1 to the largest possible one.,title=\"fig : \" ]    first of all , we sought out those days pertaining to different @xmath0 models on which there are nearly the same number of infected people , say , from 17000 to 18000 , or , if there happens to be no such a number falling into this span , from 16000 to 19000 .",
    "then we used an array @xmath68 $ ] to record the number of healthy ones who contact with w infected ones that day ( here w varies from 1 to 45 ) .",
    "analytically , we can give the expression of @xmath72 of a given day as@xmath73g[w]-\\delta n_{ref}(t+1)\\]]the last term @xmath74 refers to the number of infected people that change to the refractory state that day .",
    "in fig.3 , given the same @xmath67 ( @xmath67 from 1 to 6 ) , @xmath68 $ ] varies greatly according to different @xmath0 : the greater the value of @xmath0 is , the more @xmath68 $ ] it has .",
    "that is the main reason why epidemic disease spreads faster at a larger @xmath0 .",
    "but from the small - scale graph , we see that of different @xmath0 @xmath68 $ ] are in a close range when @xmath67 becomes larger .",
    "this has little effect on the result because when @xmath67 is large enough , the possibility of being infected is very close to @xmath5 .",
    "( the possibility of being infected equals to @xmath75 ) .",
    "so it is the part of small @xmath67 that really counts .",
    "why does it work as an exponential function of @xmath0 ?",
    "unfortunately we ca nt figure out the underlying reason analytically . as mentioned above",
    ", the result in fig.3 can prove it reasonable , but far from shedding light on the nature of the phenomenon .",
    "however , the result has its instructional meanings in reality in some a way .",
    "when the epidemic disease emerges , what should we do to effectively check its spread ? we may expect to minimize its harm by restricting the freedom of people s daily activities , that is , alarm people not to go out and touch people as few as possible .",
    "then how about its effect ?",
    "if our model works , the result in fig.2 tells us that unless we can limit people s activities to an extremely low degree ( @xmath76 ) , it wo nt live up to our expectations in controlling the disease spread . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "2 , we see that the fluctuations of the characteristic moving probability are not small",
    ". it also makes it hard to minimize the spreading speed of infection by restricting the freedom of people s activities .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the moving probability of a small world network has a profound influence on the speed for the spreading of an infection .",
    "the dynamic behavior of an sirs epidemic model is closely related to @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic time of infection spreading in the initial stage decreases with the increasing of moving probability @xmath0 in an exponential way .",
    "this may be explained in some a sense by the simulated results in fig.3 , where an effect of the social contact change is observed .",
