    "clusters of galaxies are characterized by thermal emission in the @xmath3 to @xmath4  kev soft x - ray region ( @xmath5 ) as a result of bremsstrahlung radiation of the hot intracluster gas ( @xmath6  kev ) . however , the detection of radiation at radio wavelengths @xcite , as well as in the extreme ultraviolet ( @xmath7  kev ; euv ) @xcite and at hard x - rays ( @xmath8  kev ; hxr ) @xcite , indicates the presence of non - thermal activity in these systems .",
    "there is general consensus that radio emission is produced by synchrotron radiation originated from the interaction of relativistic electrons with the cluster magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "euv radiation might be produced either by a cooler thermal component ( @xmath10  kev ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the same population of relativistic electrons responsible for the radio emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter process might also explain the hxr emission @xcite , although this possibility is still matter of debate .    regarding the radio emission , whose non - thermal origin is firmly established , clusters of galaxies present two different sources of diffuse large - scale synchrotron emission , known as ` radio halos ' and ` radio relics ' .",
    "the former are located at the centre of clusters and are characterized by unpolarized radio emission with structures that roughly resemble that shown by the x - ray emission , whereas the latter are polarized radio sources more irregularly shaped found at the periphery of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "radio relics have been observed in several clusters .",
    "the most extended and powerful sources of this class have been detected in clusters with central radio halos , such as coma @xcite and abell clusters a2163 @xcite , a2255 @xcite , a2256 @xcite and a2744 @xcite .",
    "only few clusters present double opposite relics , being the most prominent examples those found in a3667 @xcite , and a3376 @xcite .",
    "the large radio flux recently detected from the relics of a3376 is an evidence of that relativistic leptons are present in those regions .",
    "for this reason , in the present work we will be concerned with the non - thermal processes taking place in the outskirts of the cluster abell 3376 where the two giant and almost symmetric radio relics are located .",
    "nevertheless , the model that we will present in this paper is also valid for clusters which present only one relic . in the case of abell 3376",
    "the radio flux is more than one order the magnitude larger than in other radio emitting clusters , like abell 521 and abell 2163",
    ".    there is increasing evidence that the radio emitting particles in relics are accelerated by accretion and merger shocks generated in the intracluster medium ( icm ) during cosmological large - scale structure formation . because of the electron short radiative lifetimes , radio emission can be efficiently produced close to the location of the shock waves .",
    "thus , the origin of radio relics can be explained if they are considered to trace the position of these very large shocks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to the standard diffusive shock acceleration theory , shock waves in the presence of even modest and turbulent magnetic fields are sites of efficient acceleration of charged particles @xcite .",
    "another possibility may be adiabatic compression in these environmental shock waves @xcite .",
    "based on the inferred population of high energy particles involved in the previously mentioned non - thermal processes , it is natural to expect gamma - ray emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "this emission could be generated from neutral pion decay in cosmic ray collisions in the icm @xcite , or by ic scattering that involves cmb photons and relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are a useful tool to estimate the properties of the cosmic ray populations in galaxy clusters and their effects on thermal cluster observables , as well as to predict the radiation emitted by these large virialized objects at @xmath11-ray energies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a different numerical approach has been used by @xcite to investigate the temporal evolution of particle and photon spectra resulting from non - thermal processes at the shock fronts formed in merging clusters of galaxies .",
    "all these works point to clusters in general as sources of @xmath11-ray emission observable with glast satellite .",
    "these theoretical results are consistent with the fact that no @xmath11-ray emission has been detected so far with the current observational facilities , as indicated by the lack of correlations between unresolved egret @xmath11-ray sources and nearby x - ray bright galaxy clusters @xcite . only marginal evidence for emission from a1758 within the location error contours of the source 3 eg j1337 + 5029 was reported by @xcite .",
    "perseus and abell 2029 galaxy clusters were observed by @xcite with the whipple 10 m cherenkov telescope .",
    "they find no evidence of point source or extended @xmath11-ray emission in the tev energy range .",
    "in addition , recent observations of the clusters coma and abell 496 made by @xcite with the array of chrerenkov telescopes hess have not detected significant signals of @xmath11-ray emission in exposure times of @xmath12 hours .    in the present work",
    ", we estimate the high energy emission of the recently detected radio relics in the nearby cluster abell 3376 .",
    "their radio power at @xmath13  ghz , together with the assumption of an equipartition magnetic field , constrain effectively our model which is specific of this particular cluster .",
    "we assume a diffusive shock acceleration mechanism , and include different non - thermal processes that may be acting in the radio structures .",
    "we predict that the @xmath11-ray photons created in this cluster should be detected in the near future by glast , as well as by the new generation of cherenkov arrays in the southern hemisphere , such as hess ii .",

    "the cluster mass has been estimated by applying the virial theorem to the cluster member galaxies , assuming that mass follows the galaxy distribution @xcite , giving a virial mass @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding virial radius is @xmath27  mpc .",
    "radio observations made by @xcite with the very large array ( vla ) instrument show the presence of two giant , ring - shaped structures in the periphery of the cluster at a distance of @xmath28  mpc from its centre .",

    "the presence of radio relics in abell 3376 might be interpreted as the result of an on - going merger of subclusters @xcite .",
    "thus , the chosen simulated cluster has similar dynamical state as the observed one ; it has a virial mass @xmath44 . from the analysis of this simulation we obtain @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "for the rest of the paper we express all numerical values adopting @xmath25 .",
    "shock waves generated during the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters are the main source for thermalization of the intracluster gas and the acceleration of particles @xcite .",
    "the activity of radio galaxies embedded in the clusters also contribute to the population of relativistic particles , leaving fossil radio plasma that is detected as cavities in x - ray surface brightness maps ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "two radio galaxies have been observed in the cluster abell 3376 .",
    "the radio source mrc 0600 - 399 is associated with the second brightest cluster member galaxy , and the other radio source is possibly originated from an elliptical galaxy .",
    "these radio galaxies are located within the central region of the cluster from where thermal bremsstrahlung emission is detected .",
    "therefore , we can consider that the ring - shape radio structures present in the periphery of the cluster are not connected with these point sources .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray and radio emission observed in the cluster abell 3376 suggests that it is undergoing a merger .",
    "as numerical simulations show ( e.g. @xcite ) , shock waves propagate in both directions along the line that connects the centres of the merging clusters , with the radio relics observed almost exclusively at the location of the shock fronts .",
    "thus , particle acceleration induced by shock waves generated during this process is a suitable scenario for explaining the origin of the relics .",
    "taking into account observational evidences and numerical results , we assume that the content of relativistic particles in the relics arises as a result of the acceleration by mergers shocks , neglecting the possible contribution of the radio galaxies . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the acceleration processes and losses that affect both electrons and protons , which determine the particle distributions and their subsequent evolution .",
    "the diffuse radio emission produced at the location of relics supports the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "although there is no observational evidence of the existence of relativistic protons in the radio relics , these particles could be accelerated in the same way as electrons are .",
    "we focus here on the acceleration of particles at the ( non - relativistic ) shock front via a diffusive process , such as first order fermi mechanism . in this theory ,",
    "the time - scale related to the rate of energy gain of particles is @xmath49 where @xmath11 is the lorentz factor and @xmath50 is the energy ( @xmath51 ) up to which the particle , electron or proton , is accelerated ; @xmath52 is the magnetic field .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 involves the velocity of the shock , @xmath39 , and the ratio @xmath54 between the mean free path of the particle and its gyroradius ; the latter can be expressed as @xmath55/(300\\,z\\,b[\\rm g])$ ] , being @xmath56 the charge number of the particle . for the shock velocity we assume a typical value of @xmath57 , as it is inferred from the analysis of our cluster simulation , being in agreement with general simulations results ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then , assuming bohm diffusion ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , we have @xmath59 .",
    "the rate of accelerated particles , @xmath60 , injected in the source follows a power - law energy distribution with a spectral index @xmath61 , typical of a diffusive acceleration mechanism and in accordance with the estimated mach number @xmath62 ( see @xcite for similar values of the spectral index in coma cluster ) .",
    "once the accelerated particles are injected , their spectral energy distributions evolve as a consequence of radiative and advection losses .",
    "the latter refer to the escape of particles from the acceleration region .    in order to study the time - evolution of the energy distribution of particles , we need to calculate the leptonic and hadronic radiative losses . in the following ,",
    "we refer as primary particles to those relativistic particles that have been accelerated at the shock front by the fermi - like mechanism .",
    "secondary particles are the products originated from the interactions suffered by relativistic protons with target thermal protons of the icm .",

    "the rest is used in the creation of charged pions that will decay finally producing electron - positron pairs ( @xmath65 ) and neutrinos .",

    "losses produced by synchrotron radiation are computed as @xmath86 the calculation of synchrotron losses requires the knowledge of magnetic field , @xmath52 .",

    "efficient production of secondary electrons requires a dense population of thermal protons as a target .",
    "however , this condition is not found at the peripheral cluster regions which are characterized by low density gas ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of secondary pairs to the total energy density ( eq .  [ equipartition ] ) is neglected .",
    "then , applying the constraint of the radio flux observed for abell 3376 ( @xmath30  mjy ) , we estimate the magnetic field and the normalization constant of the energy distribution of primary accelerated electrons , @xmath112 , and protons , @xmath113 .",

    "these kind of radio structures detected in several clusters of galaxies suggest a rich content of accelerated particles in the icm , with energies as high as @xmath181 and @xmath182 ev for electrons and protons , respectively . taking into account that radio relics are tracers of merger shocks",
    ", we assume that a diffusive shock acceleration mechanism acting at the wave shocks gives place to such a population of relativistic particles .",
    "these particles are subsequently cooled by different leptonic and hadronic radiative processes .",
    "we have considered syncrotron radiation , ic scattering and relativistic bremsstrahlung that affect relativistic primary electrons .",
    "relativistic protons are involved in @xmath63-interactions with the thermal protons of the icm .",
    "this process give raise to a population of secondary pairs , @xmath65 , that are cooled by the same processes that affect the population of primary electrons .",
    "the parameters involved in these non - thermal processes , such as the magnetic field and normalization of the energy distribution of accelerated particles , have been estimated from the constraints established by the observed radio power in the relics and the assumption of equipartition .",
    "x - ray observations allows us to extract information about the volume of these acceleration sources . on the other hand ,",
    "results from a simulated cluster have provided the typical gas density of the relics and the velocity of ths shock .",
    "we find that particle energy distributions reach a stationary regime by the lifetime of the relics ( @xmath2  gyr ) .",
    "the steady energy distribution of particles are computed and the seds of the radiation produced at the relic position derived . in our calculations",
    ", we have adopted different ratios ( @xmath148 ) for the relativistic proton / electron energy densities . at larger energies ,",
    "gamma - ray emission is mainly produced by @xmath159-decay but with a considerably smaller luminosity , even for the case where a large energy density of protons is considered ( @xmath183 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that no cluster has been yet observed at these high energies .",
    "the proximity of the cluster studied in this paper and its high content of relativistic particles in the radio - relics make abell 3376 an interesting potential target for the investigation of gamma - ray emission in this type of objects .",
    "this source might be detected at @xmath11-rays by glast satellite and by hess array with a reasonable exposure time .",
    "in addition , future cherenkov telescopes in the southern hemisphere , like hess ii , could easily detect the high - energy emission from abell 3376 .",
