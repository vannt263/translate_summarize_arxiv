    "recently we have witnessed a strong revival of interest in the theoretical questions related to decoherence , in particular due to an immense practical potential of the upcoming quantum information processing technology @xcite . in order to design quantum devices capable of coherent quantum manipulation",
    ", one has to be able to control and minimize the decoherence due to an unavoidable weak coupling between the system of the device and the environment .",
    "traditionally , one uses idealized harmonic heat bath models of an environment , and very often also harmonic description of the central system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the rate of decoherence , or quantum dissipation , may depend on the intrinsic dynamics of the central system , whether be chaotic or not .",
    "it has been argued by zurek that the rate of decoherence as characterized by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix increases with the rate which is given by the classical phase space stretching rate ( lyapunov exponent ) , for the quantum state which is initially given as minimal uncertainty gaussian wave - packet and for sufficiently short times .",
    "recently , jalabert and pastawski have studied the so - called _ quantum loschmidt echo _ @xcite , or _ quantum fidelity _ , which may be treated as a measure of dynamical reversibility under a slight change in the hamiltonian , and found a similar relation to classical stretching rate for short times as for decoherence .",
    "this reflects correspondence between classical and quantum evolution of wave packets up to the ehrenfest time @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "later on , numerous papers appeared addressing related issues @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown @xcite that the behaviour of quantum fidelity may be completely different , if either the time is longer than the ehrenfest time , or if the initial ( pure ) state is more complex , e.g. random .",
    "in general , the rate of fidelity decay is given by the time - integral of autocorrelation function of the perturbation operator , and this is bigger the less chaotic is the dynamics thus making the fidelity lower , and vice versa .    in previous papers @xcite we have studied fidelity and the so - called purity fidelity characterizing the stability of quantum evolution , or quantum echoes , to the perturbation of dynamics in a generally coupled composite system , i.e. where both perturbed and unperturbed systems were coupled . in a situation where we are interested only in the properties of a central subsystem , one usually does not have the above general situation but a more specific one .",
    "namely , the coupling to the environment is usually unwanted and small and so in an ideal ( unperturbed ) case we would like to have two decoupled systems . in that case",
    "we are interested in how the coupling of a central system to the environment changes the properties of the central system .",
    "so rather than comparing evolution in two general systems , in which both have coupling between subsystems , we have a situation where in an unperturbed case the systems are uncoupled and become coupled only because of the perturbation .",
    "this situation is studied in the present paper .",
    "we develop a unified theoretical framework to deal with different physical situations : ( i ) coherence of forward evolution as measured by purity of the reduced density matrix traced over the subsystem , ( ii ) stability of time evolution with respect to small coupling between the subsystems , and ( iii ) loschmidt echo measuring dynamical irreversibility .",
    "stability is measured either by fidelity of pure states of a composite system , or by the so - called _ reduced fidelity _ of reduced density matrices within a subsystem .",
    "we find general linear response formula expressing the fidelity , the reduced fidelity and the purity , in terms of time - correlation functions of the generator of the perturbation within the subsystems .",
    "we emphasize that the decay rates as given by linear response formalism are usually valid also in the regime of small fidelity / purity .",
    "our general qualitative conclusion is that all the three quantities decrease slower with the increasing chaoticity of the dynamics in the subsystems .",
    "our theoretical results are clearly demonstrated on a system of two coupled quantized kicked tops @xcite .",
    "in addition we find some intriguing numerical results on algebraic long - time tails of some of the stability measures .",
    "our system consists of a central system and an environment , henceforth denoted by subscripts `` s '' and `` e '' , respectively . the hilbert space of a composite system is a direct product @xmath1 .",
    "we will compare quantum evolutions generated by two hamiltonians , the unperturbed @xmath2 , and the perturbed @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 acts only on the corresponding subspace @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a dimensionless coupling strength , and @xmath8 is a general perturbation operator which couples both systems . the usual measure of stability of overall unitary evolution on the total hilbert space @xmath9 is the pure state fidelity ( equivalent to quantum loschmidt echo ) , which is the overlap between perturbed @xmath10 and unperturbed @xmath11 time evolving states , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the unitary propagators .",
    "it turns useful to define an _ echo operator _",

    "this representation of the echo operator ( [ eq : mt ] ) is very convenient as it can be used @xcite to derive various results on the behaviour of fidelity ( [ eq : f_def ] ) and related functions .",

    "the fidelity is a measure of the distance within the whole hilbert space @xmath9 . on the other hand in the spirit of our study of a central system",
    ", we would like to have a quantity that would measure distance only within the central system space @xmath24 .",
    "so we should not care if the environmental states are corrupted by the perturbation , but would just like the evolution on the subspace @xmath25 to be preserved as closely as possible . with this aim",
    "we define a new quantity that we call _ reduced fidelity _ , which is a fidelity between the reduced perturbed @xmath26 and unperturbed @xmath27 density matrices , which start from the same product ( disentangled ) initial state @xmath28 and we use obvious notation @xmath29 .",
    "the reduced fidelity @xmath30 therefore reads @xmath31}=\\trs{[\\rho_{\\s}(0 ) \\tre { \\{\\rhom\\}}]}. \\label{eq : fr_def}\\ ] ] the reduced fidelity measures the distance between the two reduced density matrices .",
    "it can be interpreted either as an inner product between two reduced density operators propagated by two nearby hamiltonians , or as an inner product between the initial and the final reduced density operator after the echo dynamics .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we are interested only in the separability ( disentanglement ) of the final echo density matrix @xmath21 , the relevant quantity is _ purity - fidelity _",
    "@xcite @xmath32 ^ 2}. \\label{eq : fp_def}\\ ] ] now we shall use the fact that @xmath2 is separable in two subsystems ( [ eq : h ] ) , so that purity - fidelity is in this case equal to _ purity _ @xcite of the coupled forward time evolution @xmath33 ^ 2 } = \\trs{[\\rhos(t)]^2}. \\label{eq : i_def}\\ ] ] in order to see that purity - fidelity is equal to purity in this situation we bring separable propagator ( @xmath34 ) out of the innermost trace and use cyclic property of a trace opeartion in the definition of @xmath35 ( [ eq : fp_def ] ) @xmath36 ^ 2}= \\trs{[u_{\\rm s}^\\dagger \\tre{\\{u_\\delta \\rho(0 ) u_\\delta^\\dagger \\ } } u_{\\rm s}]^2}=i(t).\\ ] ] this can be understood as a consequence of the purity being constant during the evolution with the separable hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "however in the general case , the purity - fidelity is a property of echo dynamics and is different from the purity of forward dynamics . since in this paper we are interested in the former case ( [ eq : h ] ) , we will from now on use a symbol @xmath37 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "summarizing , all the three quantities , namely @xmath38 and @xmath37 , measure the stability of a composite system to perturbations .",
    "the fidelity @xmath39 measures the stability of a whole state , the reduced fidelity gives the stability on @xmath25 subspace and the purity measures separability of @xmath40 .",
    "one expects that the fidelity is the most restrictive quantity of the three - @xmath41 and @xmath40 must be similar for @xmath39 to be high . for @xmath42 to be high , only the reduced density matrices @xmath43}$ ] and @xmath44}$ ] must be similar , and finally , purity @xmath37 ( [ eq : i_def ] ) is high if only @xmath40 factorizes . in a previous paper @xcite we proved an inequality @xmath45 . along the same line",
    "one can prove the following general inequality @xmath46 * proof * : write @xmath47 .",

    "next we proceed by expanding all the three important quantities in powers of the perturbation strength @xmath7 .",
    "although this procedure is very elementary , it greatly helps in understanding the behaviour of various measures of stability .",
    "the lowest order is given by various two - point time correlation functions of the perturbation and the decay time scale can be inferred from the behaviour of time integrals of this correlations .",
    "what is more , the dependence of this time scale on @xmath7 and @xmath54 as well as on the dynamics of a system ( fast correlation decay or absence of correlation decay ) is explicit .",
    "we start by expanding the echo operator @xmath55 the leading order expansion of fidelity ( [ eq : f_def ] ) is then @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes an expectation in the product initial state @xmath58 , with the general notation for a complete basis of hilbert space @xmath59 .",

    "\\label{eq : cde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above correlation integrals ( [ eq : cde ] ) are starting point for our theoretical investigations . in certain situations",
    "they can be simplified even further .",
    "we will study four different regimes in which simplification is possible : ( i ) mixing regime ( corresponding to chaotic classical dynamics in both subspaces ) in which arbitrary correlation functions appearing in ( [ eq : cde ] ) decay to @xmath72 and their integrals thus grow as @xmath73 , ( ii ) regular regime in which due to absence of mixing the whole correlation integral @xmath60 ( or @xmath68 , or @xmath69 ) grows as @xmath74 , and two regimes in which we have a separation of time scales , with the time scale of the environment being much shorter than the time scale of the central system . in this case",
    "we will work out two different regimes depending on the mixing property of the environment , namely ( iii ) `` fast mixing '' environment where environmental correlations decay ; and ( iv ) `` fast regular '' environment where the environmental correlation function has a non - vanishing time average value .",
    "the decay of fidelity and purity - fidelity in mixing and regular regimes has already been extensively discussed @xcite . in this work",
    "we do not only discuss a new quantity , namely the reduced fidelity , but also the unperturbed dynamics is now separable and thus not ergodic on the total space .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the general inequality ( [ eq : ineq ] ) is clearly satisfied in our linear response results since the functions @xmath69 and @xmath68 are written in terms of sums of non - negative real numbers [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fr2nd],[eq : fp2nd ] ) ] and are hence themselves always non - negative .",
    "we want to stress that all the results of this section can be directly translated to the discrete time case of quantum maps ( kicked quantum systems ) by simply treating @xmath75 as integer variable and replacing all the integrals by sums , @xmath76 .",
    "we will now illuminate and demonstrate our theoretical predictions with a numerical example of two coupled kicked tops .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations will provide us with some insight about the asymptotic behaviour for long times and small fidelity / purity .",
    "note that here the time is discrete ( integer ) and measured in the number of kicking periods ( steps ) .",
    "a single kicked top @xcite has a unitary one step ( floquet ) propagator @xmath77 the level of chaoticity ( e.g. the rate of mixing ) of a single top can be varied by varying @xmath78 and the time scale can be influenced by changing the angle @xmath79 . in order to be able to study the reduced fidelity and the purity we couple two kicked tops , where one top will act as an environment an the other as a central system .",
    "two coupled kicked tops @xcite have the following unitary one step propagator @xmath80 with @xmath81 being propagators for a single kicked top of a system or environment . the unperturbed propagator @xmath82 is simply obtained by putting @xmath53 into above expression ( [ eq : ud ] ) .",
    "perturbation @xmath83 will be chosen to be of two different forms : for regimes ( i),(ii ) and ( iii ) both @xmath84 have the same form , whereas in the regime ( iv ) we will take @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the reason for chosing a different form of perturbation in case ( iv ) is that we there want the environmential time correlation function to have a non - vanishing time - average in order to yield generic results . in other cases ( i - iii )",
    "the precise form of the force and position operators is irrelevant , so @xmath87 provides the simplest choice .",
    "the planck constant is determined by @xmath88 as @xmath89 , so that the semiclassical limit implies @xmath90 .",
    "the initial condition will always be a direct product of coherent states for both tops , @xmath91 , with the expansion of su(2 ) coherent state @xmath92 into eigenbasis @xmath93 of @xmath94 being @xmath95 let us now work out the details of the fidelity , reduced fidelity and purity decay in all four mentioned regimes .",
    "if the combined correlation function decays to zero sufficiently fast , so that its time integral converges and @xmath96 ( [ eq : ct ] ) , we can define a kind of transport coefficient @xmath97 linear response formalism thus gives us initial linear decrease of fidelity . on the other hand , the coefficient @xmath98 , occurring in the expression for purity , is small compared to @xmath60 @xcite , namely @xmath99 ( @xmath100 are dimensions of @xmath6 ) and the same holds for each individual @xmath69 or @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , up to semiclassically vanishing correction , all the three quantities are expected to decay on a same time scale .",
    "what is more , if also multi - time - correlation functions fall off fast @xcite , then the shape of decay for longer times is exponential with the exponent given by the linear response formula , @xmath101 this formula is expected to be valid for times longer than the ehrenfest time or classical mixing time , depending on the initial coherent or random state , respectively , and for sufficiently small @xmath7 such that the value of fidelity / purity is still far above the saturation for the above mentioned time scale ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . therefore , if the central system and the environment are both separately mixing ( by mixing we mean decay of all time correlation functions ) the fidelity , reduced fidelity and purity decay in the same way .",
    "this means that the decay of purity , decay of reduced fidelity and decay of fidelity have the same principal mechanism , that is `` corruption '' of the state vector as a whole which gives dominant contribution over more subtle issues of destruction of coherence .",
    "note that stronger mixing ( usually connected to stronger chaoticity of a classical system ) means smaller correlation integral @xmath102 and thus slower decay of purity , fidelity and reduced fidelity .",

    "[ fig : cor3030 ] we plot time dependence of correlation integrals occurring in expressions for fidelity ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) , reduced fidelity ( [ eq : fr2nd ] ) , and purity ( [ eq : fp2nd ] ) , showing that the terms @xmath68 and @xmath69 are really negligible as all the three quantities shown are practically equal , for times longer than the ehrenfest time .",
    "next we show in figure [ fig : fid3030 ] the decay of fidelity @xmath114 , reduced fidelity @xmath115 and purity @xmath37 for the same parameters and for the perturbation strength @xmath116 .",
    "clean exponential decay is observed in all three cases , on a time scale @xmath106 ( [ eq : fem ] ) given exactly by the lowest order linear response expression ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) in terms of @xmath102 ( [ eq : sigma ] ) which is obtained from data of figure [ fig : cor3030 ] . exponential decay , of course , persists only up to the saturation value determined by a finite hilbert space size @xcite .",
    "if the system is regular as a whole , then the time correlation function will generally not decay to zero , but will have a non - vanishing average value @xmath117 similar coefficients can be defined for the average of @xmath118 occurring in the expansion of the reduced fidelity , and @xmath119 for the purity . note that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath54 for coherent initial states . as shown before @xcite , the expression @xmath98 is almost equal to @xmath60 for coherent initial states in the regime of regular - integrable classical dynamics .",
    "the expression @xmath105 occurring in the formula for purity ( [ eq : fp2nd ] ) is therefore of the order @xmath120 and the decay time scale for purity decay is @xmath54 independent .",
    "this cancellation in the leading order in @xmath54 happens due to both @xmath69 and @xmath68 terms and the reduced fidelity will therefore decay on approximately the same time scale as the fidelity . for coherent initial states one can show @xcite that the shape of decay is a gaussian @xmath121 and with similar expression , only with @xmath122 replacing @xmath123 , for reduced fidelity .",
    "remember that for coherent initial states @xmath124 and therefore @xmath125 .",
    "the time scale for decay of purity is again given by an analogous expression , namely @xmath126 , with @xmath127 , but as we will see in the numerical simulations and discuss later , its long time behaviour is not a gaussian but has an algebraic tail instead .    for the numerical demonstration we take two kicked tops with @xmath84 , @xmath128 , @xmath110 and @xmath129 in order to have regular dynamics in both subspaces .",

    "this is a simple consequence of the separation of time scales and means that the decay of all the three stability measures does not depend on the dynamics of the central system ( e.g. being mixing ( chaotic ) or regular . )",
    "furthermore , the reduced fidelity @xmath42 and the purity @xmath37 will decay on the same time scale ( [ eq : fastcde ] ) , meaning that the decay of reduced fidelity is predominantly caused by the loss of coherence , i.e. entanglement between the two factor spaces .",
    "this means that the reduced fidelity , which is a property of echo dynamics of comparison of two slightly different hamiltonian evolutions , is equivalent to the decay of purity or growth of linear entropy of an individual weakly coupled system .",
    "if the initial state of a central system @xmath168 is a gaussian wave packet ( coherent state ) then the dispersion of @xmath169 is by a factor of order @xmath170 _ smaller _ than @xmath171 .",
    "thus for coherent initial states of a central system , no matter what the initial state of the environment , the @xmath42 and @xmath37 are going to decay on a @xmath170 times _ longer _ time scale than @xmath39 .",
    "we have therefore reached a general conclusion based on very weak assumptions of chaotic fast environment , namely that the coherent states are most robust against decoherence ( provided @xmath172 ) , and that decoherence takes place in times longer than the correlation time of environment @xmath173 . if decoherence is even faster than the time scale of the environment , as is the case for macroscopic superpositions , then formulas ( [ eq : fastcde ] ) are not valid any more as one is effectivelly in a regular regime of the previous section .",

    "actually , we could take any value of @xmath192 and would get qualitatively similar results .",
    "the only advantage of using regular central dynamics @xmath188 is that it is then possible to explicitly calculate averages @xmath171 and @xmath169 .",

    "they agree nicely with numerics for @xmath191 . in the figure [ fig : fid300 ]",

    "but if one looks at the purity level @xmath149 , they do nt agree as well , meaning that the nature ( shape ) of purity decay may change ( not only the scale ) as one vary @xmath7 or @xmath54 . on the other hand , this may also be simply a finite size effect due to finite hilbert space dimensions .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the stability of unitary time evolution of composite systems under the weak coupling between subsystems .",
    "this is a natural ( unitary ) model for dissipation and decoherence in quantum mechanics where one subsystem plays the role of the central system and the other plays the role of the environment . but",
    "this is not the only possible application of the above ideas .",
    "one may also be interested in the dynamical effects of weak coupling between two controllable parts of the system , like e.g. the atom and the electromagnetic cavity @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed three different quantities which are treated on a similar theoretical footing but which have different physical interpretations .",
    "the first two , namely the fidelity and the reduced fidelity , refer to the case of echo dynamics where the forward evolution is generated by the uncoupled system while the backward evolution is generated by the weakly coupled system .",
    "the third one , namely the purity , refers to the growth of linear entropy or growth of entanglement between the two subsystems during the course of weakly coupled forward evolution .",
    "first we have shown a rigorous inequality between the three quantities which may be useful to provide various bounds .",
    "then we have developed a linear response theory which predicts time scales for the three quantities in terms of time correlation functions of the perturbation in each of the subsystems .",
    "thus we have been able to classify all different behaviours with respect to regularity or chaoticity ( as defined here by the mixing property ) of each of the subsystems .",
    "the general conclusion is again , consistent with @xcite , that strong chaos stabilizes quantum dynamics with respect to the intersystem coupling , and that strong chaos decreases the rate of entanglement ( or linear entropy ) growth .",
    "in particular , if the characteristic time scales of correlation decay in two subsystems are well separated , then we can integrate over the correlation functions of the fast subsystem and obtain expressions which are independent of the nature of dynamics in the slow subsystem .",
