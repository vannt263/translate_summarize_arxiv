    "<S> to alleviate the black - hole ( bh ) information problem , we study a holographic - principle - inspired nonlocal model of hawking radiation in which radiated particles created at different times all have the same temperature corresponding to the instantaneous bh mass . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the black hole loses mass not only by continuously radiating new particles , but also by continuously warming previously radiated particles . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation of energy implies that the radiation stops when the mass of the black hole reaches the half of the initial bh mass , leaving a massive bh remnant with a mass much above the planck scale .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 04.70.dy keywords : hawking radiation ; black - hole remnant ; nonlocality    there are two ( not necessarily independent ) problems related to the information contained in black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is to explain why the information contained in the black hole is proportional to its surface , rather than to its volume . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is to reconcile the process of hawking radiation with the principle of unitary evolution , according to which information can not be destroyed .    </S>",
    "<S> a paradigm introduced as a theoretical framework for dealing with the first problem is the holographic principle @xcite , according to which the information that can be stored inside the black hole is determined by its boundary - the black - hole ( bh ) horizon . </S>",
    "<S> one immediate consequence of the holographic principle is _ nonlocality _ - in some way , the degrees of freedom inside the black hole should know about the boundary . to explain the holographic principle , one must go beyond local quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> there are indications that string theory possesses certain nonlocal features ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but the fact is that there is not yet a general well - understood theory of holography . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the holographic principle often serves merely as a guiding principle in construction of physical models . </S>",
    "<S> a possible solution of the second problem is a bh remnant scenario , according to which the process of hawking radiation stops before the black hole evaporates completely , so that all the bh information can be contained in the bh remnant . </S>",
    "<S> a problem with the bh remnant scenario is to find a physical mechanism that stops the hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> if this mechanism is an effect of quantum gravity , one generically expects that the significant deviation from semiclassical gravity occurs at the planck scale , so that the mass and radius of the remnant are of the order of the planck mass and planck distance , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such a light remnant that can contain a huge amount of information is problematic @xcite because light objects that can exist in a huge number of different states are expected to be often produced in various physical processes , which is not seen in nature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a _ massive remnant _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( i.e. , a remnant with a mass much larger than the planck mass ) seems to be a more attractive possibility , but the problem is to find a physical mechanism that makes remnants so massive . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that the light remnant can not exist without the hawking radiation entangled with the bh interior @xcite , so that the total system - the black hole together with its hawking radiation - is not light at all . </S>",
    "<S> however , it would be more appealing if the bh remnant itself would remain massive .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present work is to suggest a possible nonlocal physical mechanism that could stop the process of hawking radiation much before reaching the planck scale , thus leaving a massive bh remnant that can store the bh information . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism we suggest is inspired by the holographic principle and partially by the suggestion @xcite that there should exist a nonlocal connection between the degrees of freedom in the bh interior and those outside of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic principle suggests that the degrees of freedom in the bh interior are determined by its boundary - the bh horizon . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if there is also a nonlocal relation between some exterior degrees of freedom with those in the bh interior , then these exterior degrees of freedom could also be determined by the same bh boundary . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not seem reasonable to expect that _ all _ exterior degrees of freedom are determined by a single bh boundary . </S>",
    "<S> ( there may be a lot of black holes in the universe , so one particular black hole can not play a preferred role for all exterior degrees of freedom . ) instead , neglecting the interaction of the hawking radiation with other exterior degrees of freedom , we assume that only the hawking radiation radiated from this particular black hole remains in a nonlocal contact with its boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the horizon relevant to the process of hawking radiation is the apparent horizon @xcite , which , in the case of hawking radiation , is a time - dependent object . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent temperature @xmath0 associated with the time - dependent apparent horizon is determined by the time - dependent bh mass @xmath1 , through the relation @xcite @xmath2 where we use units @xmath3 . in the standard semiclassical analysis of the process of bh radiation , when particles are radiated away from the black hole , then the temperature of these particles does not change with subsequent bh evolution . instead </S>",
    "<S> , if these particles do not interact with other exterior degrees of freedom , their temperature remains the same , despite the fact that later bh temperature may change . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is a consequence of locality , according to which radiated particles can not know about possible later changes of the bh temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , if radiated particles remain in a nonlocal contact with its source - the evolving apparent horizon - then it seems reasonable to assume that this nonlocal contact could manifest as a nonlocal thermodynamic system in which _ all _ radiated particles have the _ same _ temperature ( [ temp ] ) given by the instantaneous bh mass @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in addition to the standard backreaction of hawking radiation on the black hole ( owing to which the bh mass decreases , such that the total energy measured by a distant observer is conserved ) , there is an additional nonlocal backreaction of the horizon on the previously radiatied particles , owing to which the temperature of these radiated particles increases .    now let us see how such a nonlocal backreaction leads to massive bh remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of all radiated particles at the time @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number of radiated particles at the time @xmath4 and @xmath7 is the average energy per particle . </S>",
    "<S> according to our assumption , all radiated particles have the same temperature @xmath0 at a given time @xmath4 , so , for massless particles in a thermal equilibrium , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the spin of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy must be conserved , at each time @xmath4 there must be @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial bh mass corresponding to @xmath12 . inserting ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) into ( [ cons ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qe ] ) can also be viewed as a quadratic equation for @xmath15 , with the general solution @xmath16 the upper sign is the correct one consistent with the requirement that @xmath17 when @xmath12 . during the evolution in time , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 increases while @xmath15 decreases , until the number of radiated particles attains the critical value @xmath18 which corresponds to the vanishing square root in ( [ qsol ] ) . at this moment </S>",
    "<S> , the mass of the black hole attains the critical value @xmath19 can the mass further decrease after reaching this critical value ? </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , it would be possible only by taking the lower sign in ( [ qsol ] ) at times after the mass has reached the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , after this critical moment of time , @xmath6 should start to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to an inverted process of hawking radiation , in which the outgoing hawking particles suddenly reverse their direction of motion , thus becoming ingoing particles that eventually become destroyed when they approach the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> a sudden inversion of the direction of motion does not seem to be physical , so we conclude that such a further decrease of mass is unphysical . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the critical mass ( [ mc ] ) is the _ </S>",
    "<S> smallest possible mass _ of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the final state of bh radiation is a massive remnant with the mass equal to the half of the initial bh mass . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , such a massive remnant solves the problem of unitary evolution without leading to overproduction of light objects that can store a huge amount of information . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , such massive bh remnants could be responsible for the existence of dark matter in the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us study the time evolution of such a radiating black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the radiation energy @xmath20 is equal to the negative change of the bh mass @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ( [ e1 ] ) implies @xmath22 note that the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ e3 ] ) is absent in the standard approach , because , in the standard approach , one assumes that the temperature of the fixed number of radiated particles does not change , so that @xmath23 in ( [ e3 ] ) . in our approach , from ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) we find @xmath24 the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ e3 ] ) can be calculated in the same way as in the standard scenario . assuming that the black hole radiates as a perfect black body , we use the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath27 is the bh surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ( [ sb ] ) with ( [ temp ] ) can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sb1 ] ) with ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ temp ] ) can be written as the differential equation @xmath30 similarly , by inserting ( [ ndif ] ) and ( [ sb1 ] ) into ( [ e3 ] ) , we obtain another differential equation @xmath31 eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nt ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) represent a system of two coupled equations that determine the functions @xmath32 and @xmath1 , with the initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . from ( [ nc ] ) , ( [ mc ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we see that @xmath35 diverges at the critical values of @xmath6 and @xmath15 . for a numerical analysis of the system of equations ( [ nt ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) , it is convenient to introduce the rescaled variables @xmath36 eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nt ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) then become @xmath37 with the initial conditions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , which does not involve numerical constants that are not of the order of unity . </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nt ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) can also be solved analytically . from ( [ nt ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the differential equation @xmath40 , the solution of which is given by ( [ qe ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by inserting ( [ qe ] ) into ( [ mt ] ) , we obtain a decoupled differential equation @xmath41 this is easily integrated to give @xmath42 where the requirement @xmath43 is incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with ( [ mc ] ) , determines the time needed for the black hole to approach the critical mass : @xmath44    let us compare the results above with those in the standard semiclassical scenario of bh radiation . in this case , there is no second term on the right hand side of ( [ e3 ] ) , so ( [ mt ] ) is replaced by a simpler equation @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , instead of ( [ mtsol ] ) , we obtain a simpler solution @xmath46{m_0 ^ 3 - 3\\sigma't}.\\ ] ] the critical point at which @xmath35 diverges corresponds to @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of radiated particles satisfies ( [ nt ] ) which is easily integrated to give @xmath49 leading to @xmath50 . comparing it with ( [ nc ] ) , we see that the number of particles produced in the massive remnant scenario is equal to the half of that in the standard scenario . combining ( [ mts ] ) with ( [ nts ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath51 which is to be compared with ( [ qsol ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolutions of the bh mass in the two scenarios ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mtsol ] ) and ( [ mts ] ) ) are compared in fig .  1 .     the bh mass @xmath52 as a function of the rescaled time @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve represents the massive remnant scenario , while the dotted curve represents the standard scenario . ]    as we have seen , the assumption that , at each time , all radiated particles have the same temperature given by the instantaneous bh mass leads to massive bh remnants . </S>",
    "<S> such remnants offer a solution to the problem of unitarity of bh evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the main problem with such a scenario is to find an independent justification of such an assumption that clearly contradicts the principle of locality . in particular , this assumption requires a preferred notion of the time coordinate , but note that this preferred time coordinate is the same preferred time coordinate as the one needed to define particles in the standard description of bh radiation @xcite , which , in an ideal case , can be identified with the killing time . </S>",
    "<S> ( note also that the definition of particles in quantum field theory is intrinsically _ nonlocal _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even when formulated in terms of local particle currents @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that such a nonlocal thermodynamic behaviour could be related to the holographic principle , but a clear derivation of this relation is missing . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the fact that such a simple assumption leads to such a simple ( and surprising ! ) solution to the problem of bh unitarity leads us to suspect that this assumption could be on the right track . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , the future research could reveal a more compelling explanation of our assumption . </S>"
