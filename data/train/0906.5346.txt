    "however , more far - ir observations of @xmath20 mid - ir selected samples are needed to assess the selection s completeness in choosing both star forming ulirgs and agn dominated ulirgs at @xmath0 .",
    "selection at 350@xmath1 m  at z@xmath142 has similar temperature biases as 850@xmath1 m  and 1200@xmath1 m   due to its high flux limit ( s@xmath8810mjy at 2@xmath26 ) .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , 350@xmath1 m  selection at @xmath89 has the potential to select smgs and hot - dust ulirgs equally well since it samples the dust sed near its peak for a wide range of temperatures .",

    "when it begins full operations , the _ herschel space observatory _ will be another observing tool at 350@xmath1 m  and will dramatically improve the depth of 70@xmath1 m  observations in many heavily observed fields , thus providing better statistics at shorter fir wavelengths .",
    "in addition , future work from the scuba2 instrument at 450@xmath1 m  have the potential to expand the sample of @xmath90 ulirgs through deeper observations near the peak of the dusts sed .",
    "this paper has observationally demonstrated that submillimetre wavelength observations of galaxies at @xmath90 have a strong temperature bias which preferentially detects galaxies with cooler dust temperatures . by selecting ulirgs that are detected at 70@xmath1 m  ( and verifying that they are starburst dominated )",

    "their volume density is 1.4@xmath3310@xmath66mpc@xmath67 , approximately 5@xmath33 more rare than smgs , although this has likely been underestimated due to spectroscopic incompleteness and large variations in the sensitivity limits of 70@xmath1 m  surveys .    like most ir - selected dusty galaxies ,",
    "the sfrs in these hot dust ulirgs are on average much higher than the majority of uv - selected star - forming galaxies at the same epoch . while some uv - selected sources have high stellar masses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hainline  et  al . , in preparation )",
    "they show consistently lower sfrs , reiterating that the uv misses the most dramatic star - forming galaxies at high redshift . due to their similarity with smgs ( in terms of stellar mass , uv - spectra , fir and radio luminosities ) ,",
    "the hot - dust ulirgs represent an extension of smgs towards a wider range of dust temperatures at z@xmath91 , similar to the already observed wide range in dust temperatures seen in local ulirgs .",
    "we have shown that agn contribute little to the fir luminosities in six of the eight hot dust ulirgs .",
    "the detection of extended radio emission ( with typical radii 2 - 3kpc ) suggests spatially distributed star formation rather than compact agn .",
    "in addition , the uv - spectral properties and low x - ray luminosities are consistent with star formation .",
    "the two ulirgs that do show signs of agn activity also have evidence for substantial star formation and are therefore comparable to smgs which contain bright agn .    combining our hot - dust ulirg population with the smgs results in a sample of @xmath20 ulirgs with less temperature - dependent bias than the smg population alone .",
    "however , we have shown that searches for high redshift fir luminous galaxies are likely still somewhat incomplete .",
    "even at @xmath20 , there are likely other fir luminous galaxies which are not well characterized by current submm or fir observations . @xmath92 and scuba2 will help push detection of more @xmath0 ulirgs in the 50 - 500@xmath1 m  range while more work with deeper radio observations ( from _ e_-merlin and evla ) will be needed to find potential ulirg activity beyond @xmath93 . by working towards completeness in the @xmath0 ulirg population",
