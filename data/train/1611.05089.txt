    ", energy conservation is satisfied given that the sum of the energy of the individual photons should be equal to the energy of the transition that is addresed .",
    "the tpa phenomena was theoretically proposed by maria goeppert mayer on 1931 @xcite and it was experimentally demonstrated after the invention of the laser @xcite .",
    "tpa has been studied using high intensity pulsed lasers on the femtosecond @xcite and picosecond @xcite regime and it has been extensively used for spectroscopic and microscopic techniques @xcite as well as in photoinduced phenomena on a wide variety of materials.@xcite    in recent years , an interest to study tpa induced by sources with different statistical properties than lasers , such as thermal , @xcite squeezed @xcite and entangled light,@xcite has appeared . particularly , entangled light has been experimentally tested as a convenient source to induce two - photon transitions on molecules due to its non - classical properties .",
    "one of the motivations for this type of work is the possibility to induce tpa with a low photon flux .",
    "this capability may have important implications reducing photodestruction probability and photo - bleaching of the sample , allowing to develop less invasive methods to study tpa in biological samples.@xcite entangled light has also been used to induce tpa in semiconductors to study temporal correlations of twin beams @xcite . from a theoretical perspective , tpa induced by",
    "entangled light with different type of frequency correlations has been studied as a tool to learn about the spectral properties of a sample .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study tpa induced in molecules by entangled light , generated by the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc)@xcite pumped by a cw laser , at a low photon flux . the probability of entangled tpa in a sample is quantified by means of the entangled tpa cross section , @xmath0 .",
    "we infer the value of @xmath0 for the commercially available compounds zinc tetraphenylporphyrin ( zntpp ) and rhodamine b ( rhb ) by measuring the absorption signal .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 for znttp have been previously reported @xcite ; however , this is , to the best of our knowledge , the first time that @xmath0 is measured for rhb .",
    "additionally , we report , for these two molecules , a systematic study of the dependence of @xmath0 on the molecular concentration .",
    "in contrast to previous experiments , @xcite our measurements are based on detecting , by means of a coincidence count circuit , the pairs of photons that are transmitted by the molecular system , improving the signal to noise ratio .",
    "in this section , we present a theoretical model to obtain @xmath0 from experiments based on coincidence counts . in general ,",
    "tpa can be induced by using entangled light and random light sources such as lasers . considering a molecular system ,",
    "the tpa rate per molecule , @xmath2 , can be written as:@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the incident photon flux density ( photons s@xmath5 ) impinging on the molecule and @xmath6 is the random tpa cross section . the quadratic term in eq .",

    "following l3 , a dichroic mirror ( dm ) and a long pass filter ( lpf ) , with cutoff wavelength at 750 nm , are used to remove the residual pump beam . after passing through the sample , the spdc photons",
