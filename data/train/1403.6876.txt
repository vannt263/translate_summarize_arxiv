    "the trace in ( [ action ] ) is over @xmath27 and spin space .",
    "we ignore the mean - field ( hartree ) correction to the single particle energy since the density and therefore the hartree potential is harmonic in the thomas - fermi approximation for a 2d gas .",
    "consequently , it can be included simply by renormalising the trapping frequency @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ mexicanfig ] illustrates the action @xmath29 in the normal and superfluid phases , and the corresponding goldstone and higgs modes .",
    "the instability towards pairing is described using mean - field theory , which is obtained as usual from the stationary phase approximation to @xmath30 yielding the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations  @xcite .",

    "we can therefore ignore the intershell matrix elements when the pairing energy is small compared to the trap level spacing @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "we refer to this regime as _ intrashell pairing _ , since the cooper pairs are formed within each harmonic oscillator shell .",

    "we therefore make the approximation @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the degeneracy of the @xmath38th shell . using that the main contribution to the pairing is from the shells around the fermi level , we end up with the gap equation ( see appendix [ appbdg ] ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    "this recovers the exact result for the two - body binding energy of an @xmath11-wave state in a 2d harmonic trap in the perturbative regime  @xcite , which illustrates an important point : the approximations we make are systematic , and ( [ gapeqn2 ] ) is it not merely a schematic model ",

    "the goldstone mode is found by solving @xmath109 .",
    "we take a circular symmetric eigenfunction @xmath110 corresponding to a monopole mode . in the spirit of the intra - shell regime , we ignore the weak @xmath111-dependence of the resulting integrals , when @xmath112 is expressed in terms of the functions @xmath31 .",
    "as detailed in appendix [ appcoll ] , this gives the eigenvalue equation @xmath113 for the collective goldstone mode , where we again have used the two - body energy to eliminate the coupling constant @xmath114 .",
    "using the gap equation ( [ gapeqn2 ] ) , we see that @xmath115 is a solution to ( [ goldstonemode ] ) .",
    "since @xmath116 and @xmath117 , this solution is furthermore completely decoupled from the amplitude oscillations .",
    "the theory thus recovers the zero energy goldstone mode corresponding to the broken @xmath118 symmetry of the phase of the pairing field .",
    "the higgs amplitude mode is found by solving @xmath119 .",
    "taking @xmath120 to be circular symmetric and ignoring again the weak @xmath111 dependence of the integrals yields an eigenfuction of the form @xmath121 .",
    "we obtain ( see appendix [ appcoll ] ) @xmath122 assuming perfect particle - hole symmetry around the fermi level , we see from the gap equation ( [ gapeqn2 ] ) that @xmath123 is a solution .",
    "this mode is decoupled from the goldstone modes and therefore undamped , since it follows from ( [ amatrixelements ] ) that @xmath124 for perfect particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this is the undamped higgs mode for the superfluid phase corresponding to monopole amplitude oscillations of the pairing field .",
    "note that particle - hole symmetry is equivalent to a lorentz - invariant low energy effective theory  @xcite .    including the particle - hole asymmetry around the fermi level changes the mode frequency only by a small amount when @xmath63 is not too small , as will be confirmed numerically below .",
    "in addition , it leads to damping of the higgs mode due to coupling to the goldstone modes .",
    "this damping is however weak for two reasons .",
    "first , in the intrashell regime pairing mainly occurs in the shells around the fermi energy which are approximately particle - hole symmetric leading to a weak coupling to the goldstone modes .",
    "second , the goldstone modes correspond to density oscillations with a typical energy @xmath125 both in the collisionless and in the hydrodynamic regimes  @xcite .",
    "the higgs mode is therefore well separated in energy from these modes since @xmath126 in the intrashell regime . in the open shell case , there are however low lying pair breaking excitations with energy @xmath127 which can damp the higgs mode , but in the closed shell case , no such low energy modes exist since the lowest single particle energies are @xmath128 .",
    "the existence of a well defined higgs mode with a sharp spectral peak for the closed shell case is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "the lack of damping of this mode is a major advantage compared to previous experimental table - top realisations of the higgs mode , where coupling to a continuum of modes leads to significant damping  @xcite .      in the closed shell case ,",
    "the system is in the normal phase for weak attraction with @xmath129 . in this case ,",
    "( [ higgsmode ] ) has to be solved with @xmath130 and the amplitude modes correspond to coherently either adding a pair of particles , or removing a pair of particles .",
    "the particle conserving collective modes correspond to subsequently adding and removing a pair of particles , and their frequencies is therefore _",
    "twice _ the frequency obtained by solving ( [ higgsmode ] ) . in the weak coupling regime @xmath131 , we obtain the collective mode frequency @xmath132 .",
    "this result can also be derived directly from first order perturbation theory using @xmath133 for the excited state , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the non - interacting ground state with all shells up to and including @xmath63 completely filled .",
    "the state @xmath136 is formed by exciting @xmath137 pairs of from the highest fully occupied shell @xmath63 to the lowest unoccupied shell @xmath138 .",
    "the excitation energy initially decreases with increasing attraction since the particles can increase their overlap in the excited state .",
    "when the excitation energy goes to zero , the system can spontaneously excite pairs from the shell @xmath63 to the shell @xmath138 , and it is unstable towards cooper pair formation , see fig .",
    "[ pairexcitefig ] .",
    "close to critical coupling strength for pairing @xmath139 , we expand ( [ higgsmode ] ) in @xmath77 and @xmath140 . evaluating the resulting sums to accuracy @xmath80 yields @xmath141",
    "the higgs mode frequency obtained from ( [ higgsmode ] ) with @xmath142 is shown in fig .",
    "[ openshellfig ] for the open shell case .",
    "we see that there is very good agreement between the numerical solution and the analytical results .",
    "the numerical solution of ( [ higgsmode ] ) is essentially indistinguishable from @xmath143 with @xmath144 determined from ( [ openshellgap ] ) .",
    "this agreement shows that particle - hole asymmetry has a negligible effect on the collective mode frequency as well as on the single particle pairing , so that that ( [ openshellgap ] ) is an accurate expression for the solution to the gap equation ( [ gapeqn2 ] ) .",
    "the pairing and therefore the higgs mode energy grows linearly with the binding energy for weak coupling whereas it increases more quickly when more shells participate in the pairing . in the case of smaller particle numbers , i.e.  smaller @xmath63 ,",
    "the analytical results agrees less with the numerics , since particle - hole asymmetry ( @xmath80 effects ) become larger .     for the open shell case with @xmath142 .",
    "the solid line is obtained by numerically solving ( [ higgsmode ] ) , the dashed line is @xmath123 with @xmath144 given by ( [ openshellgap ] ) , and the dotted line is @xmath145 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ closedshellfig ] , we plot the higgs mode frequency for the closed shell case with @xmath142 .",
    "again , we see that the analytical formulas agree very well with the numerical solution showing that particle - hole asymmetry has a negligible effect on pairing and the higgs mode frequency in the intrashell regime . as for the open shell case ,",
    "the agreement is less for smaller @xmath63 .",
    "the energy initially decreases from non - interacting value @xmath146 with increasing binding @xmath147 . at the critical coupling strength for pairing ,",
    "the mode has zero frequency and for stronger attraction when the system is superfluid , the frequency is @xmath143 .",
    "this characteristic non - monotonic behaviour of the higgs frequency near the quantum phase transition has a clear interpretation in terms of the effective interaction and broken symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ mexicanfig ] ) , and it provides a smoking gun signal for the higgs mode .     for the closed shell case with @xmath142 .",
    "the solid line is obtained by numerically solving ( [ higgsmode ] ) , and the dashed lines are ( [ higgsmodenormalclose ] ) for @xmath129 , and @xmath123 with @xmath144given by ( [ closedshellgap ] ) for @xmath85 . the critical two - body binding energy @xmath148 is given by ( [ closedshellcritical ] ) .",
    "the dotted line is the perturbative result @xmath132 . ]",
    "we note that the intrashell ansatz eventually breaks down when @xmath144 is comparable to @xmath28 and matrix elements with @xmath47 in ( [ deltannm ] ) become important .",
    "this corresponds to the coherence length of the cooper pairs becoming smaller than the system size .",
    "the system then approaches the bulk limit where the higgs mode becomes damped by coupling to the goldstone modes . in the case of a 3d harmonic trap , a comparison with a full solution to the bdg equations shows that the breakdown of the intrashell regime occurs for @xmath149 both at the single particle level  @xcite , and for the collective modes  @xcite .",
    "the higgs amplitude mode does not couple strongly to density oscillations which makes it hard to observe in condensed matter systems  @xcite . for cold atoms",
    "it can on the other hand be excited rather straightforwardly by modulating the coupling strength between the atoms for instance by changing the external magnetic field close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "this leads to a time - dependent interaction of the form @xmath150 , which couples strongly to the higgs mode by exciting pairs across the fermi energy , see fig .",
    "[ pairexcitefig ] and appendix [ apptb ] .",
    "when @xmath151 is modulated at the resonance frequency , the higgs mode will be excited which can be detected for instance by measuring the energy transferred to the system .",
    "for a small system , the transferred energy should be sizable fraction of the total energy .",
    "alternatively , the higgs mode could be detected by counting the number of atoms excited to higher shells .",
    "the number of atoms in individual oscillator levels was recently counted with single atom precision using a new generation of micro traps  @xcite .",
    "the trapping frequencies are of the order @xmath152khz in these experiments , which means that for @xmath153nk , effects of a non - zero temperature are small and one should be able to observe the effects described in this paper . finally , while present micro traps realise 1d systems with less than 10 particles , it is experimentally feasible to make these systems 2d , which in addition could increase the particle number  @xcite",
    ".    a small particle number will give rise to significant finite size effects such as the lack of a sharp quantum phase transition where the higgs mode frequency goes to zero .",
    "instead , the finite size version of the higgs mode will be characterised by a smooth non - monotonic frequency as a function of the attraction : first , it will decrease with increasing attraction until it reaches a differentiable minimum of non - zero frequency , after which it increases with increasing attraction .",
    "the minimum frequency will decrease with increasing particle number becoming sharper and sharper at the same time , as the system approaches the many - body limit .",
    "this transition between few- and many - body dynamics will be very interesting to observe .",
    "we developed a microscopic theory for pairing and collective modes in a trapped 2d fermi gas , which takes the trapping potential into account exactly .",
    "the theory is quantitatively reliable when the pairing energy is much smaller than the trap level spacing , and at the same it is simple enough to allow the derivation of several analytical results .",
    "using this theory , we demonstrated the existence of a sharp higgs mode close to the quantum phase transition between a normal and a superfluid phase , when the system is in a closed shell configuration .",
    "the trapping confinement was shown to stabilise the higgs mode against decay , since it makes the goldstone spectrum discrete with a level spacing much larger than the higgs energy .",
    "we then discussed how a new generation of cold atom experiments using micro traps can realise the physics described in this paper .",
    "our results open up the intriguing prospect of using cold atoms in micro traps to observe for the first time a long lived higgs mode in a confined geometry .",
    "this is relevant to certain models in high energy physics  @xcite , as well as to the so - called pair vibration modes , which play a central role in the theory of atomic nuclei  @xcite . in atomic nuclei , it is however very challenging to calculate the properties of these modes microscopically , and they are furthermore probed rather indirectly in nucleon transfer reactions whose interpretation is subject to intense debate .",
    "finally , we discussed how micro traps can be used to investigate the fundamental question how the `` standard model '' of broken symmetry and collective modes in condensed matter physics emerges , as the dynamics changes from few- to many - body physics with increasing particle number  @xcite .",

    ", the bogoliubov - de gennes equations read @xmath157 for the quasiparticle energies @xmath158 .",
    "the pairing matrix element is given by ( [ deltannm ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath3-dependence is weak , we make the approximation @xmath56 , and the self - consistent gap equation ( [ deltannm ] ) becomes @xmath159 where we have used @xmath160 . from ( [ gapeqn1 ] )",

    "<S> the higgs mode corresponds to the collective motion of particles due to the vibrations of an invisible field . </S>",
    "<S> it plays a fundamental role for our understanding of both low and high energy physics , giving elementary particles their mass and leading to collective modes in condensed matter and nuclear systems . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mode has been observed in a limited number of table - top systems , where it however is characterised by a short lifetime due to decay into a continuum of modes . </S>",
    "<S> a major goal which has remained elusive so far , is therefore to realise a long - lived higgs mode in a controllable system . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show how an undamped higgs mode can be observed unambiguously in a fermi gas in a two - dimensional trap , close to a quantum phase transition between a normal and a superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a first - principles theory of the pairing and the associated collective modes , which is quantitatively reliable when the pairing energy is much smaller than the trap level spacing , yet simple enough to allow the derivation of analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> the theory includes the trapping potential exactly , which is demonstrated to stabilize the higgs mode by making its decay channels discrete . </S>",
    "<S> our results show how atoms in micro - traps can unravel properties of a long - lived higgs mode , including the role of confinement and finite size effects .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the standard description of many - body systems , the broken symmetry state of a system is characterised by a collective field . </S>",
    "<S> phase oscillations of this field gives rise to massless goldstone modes , whereas oscillations in the amplitude correspond to the massive higgs mode  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs mode plays a fundamental role in our understanding of nature across many energy scales : it leads to the existence of collective modes in condensed matter systems  @xcite , pair vibration modes in atomic nuclei  @xcite , and in the standard model it gives elementary particles their mass  @xcite , as was recently confirmed in two spectacular experiments at cern  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore desirable to have controllable table - top systems where one can investigate fundamental questions such as the existence of a sharp higgs mode which is stable against decay  @xcite , and the interplay between confinement and the higgs mode , which is relevant for atomic nuclei as well as particle physics models with compact dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , since the higgs mode is a consequence of the broken symmetry of a many - particle state , an intriguing question is to examine how this mode emerges with increasing particle number . </S>",
    "<S> the list of table - top systems where the higgs mode has been observed is fairly short . </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering data for a niobium selenide superconductor are consistent with a higgs mode coupled to a charge - density wave  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , the higgs mode has been identified in neutron scattering experiments for a quantum anti - ferromagnet  @xcite , and in lattice modulation experiments for a gas of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite . in these cases , </S>",

    "<S> the higgs mode corresponds to amplitude fluctuations around the minimum of the effective action . at the quantum phase transition point between the two phases , @xmath1 , the gaussian amplitude fluctuations around @xmath2 cost zero energy . the goldstone mode corresponds to phase fluctuations in the superfluid phase . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    here , we develop a microscopic theory for the pairing of a gas of fermionic atoms confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the theory includes the trapping potential exactly , and it is quantitatively reliable in the regime where the pairing energy is smaller than the trap level spacing . we derive several analytical results for the pairing properties and the associated higgs and goldstone modes . in particular , we demonstrate that for certain `` magic numbers '' of particles trapped , a sharp higgs mode appears close to a quantum phase transition between the normal and a superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the trapping potential is shown to stabilise the higgs mode against decay , since the level spacing of the goldstone spectrum is larger than the mode frequency close to the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how the higgs mode can be excited and investigated systematically in a new generation of experiments confining atoms in micro - traps , which are well suited to form 2d systems . </S>"
