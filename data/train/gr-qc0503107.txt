    "attempts to understand the behaviour of our universe by applying the laws of physics lead to difficulties which have no parallel in the application of laws of physics to systems of more moderate scale  like atoms , solids or even galaxies .",
    "we have only one universe available for study , which itself is evolving in time ; hence , different epochs in the past history of the universe are unique and have occurred only once .",
    "standard rules of science , like repeatability , statistical stability and predictability can not be applied to the study of the entire universe in a naive manner .",
    "the obvious procedure will be to start with the current state of the universe and use the laws of physics to study its past and future .",
    "progress in this attempt is limited because our understanding of physical processes at energy scales above 100 gev or so lacks direct experimental support .",
    "what is more , cosmological observations suggest that nearly 95 per cent of the matter in the universe is of types which have not been seen in the laboratory ; there is also indirect , but definitive , evidence to suggest that nearly 70 per cent of the matter present in the universe exerts negative pressure .    these difficulties  which are unique when we attempt to apply the laws of physics to an evolving universe  require the cosmologists to proceed in a multi faceted manner .",
    "the standard paradigm is based on the idea that the universe was reasonably homogeneous , isotropic and fairly featureless  except for small fluctuations in the energy density  at sufficiently early times .",
    "it is then possible to integrate the equations describing the universe forward in time .",
    "the results will depend on only a small number ( about half a dozen ) of parameters describing the composition of the universe , its current expansion rate and the initial spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "varying these parameters allows us to construct a library of evolutionary models for the universe which could then be compared with observations in order to restrict the parameter space .",
    "we shall now describe some of the details in this approach .",
    "observations show that the universe is fairly homogeneous and isotropic at scales larger than about @xmath0 mpc , where 1 mpc @xmath1 cm is a convenient unit for extragalactic astronomy and @xmath2 characterizes@xcite the current rate of expansion of the universe in dimensionless form .",
    "( the mean distance between galaxies is about 1 mpc while the size of the visible universe is about @xmath3 mpc . )",
    "the conventional  and highly successful  approach to cosmology separates the study of large scale ( @xmath4 mpc ) dynamics of the universe from the issue of structure formation at smaller scales .",
    "the former is modeled by a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of energy density ; the latter issue is addressed in terms of gravitational instability which will amplify the small perturbations in the energy density , leading to the formation of structures like galaxies .",
    "in such an approach , the expansion of the background universe is described by a single function of time @xmath5 which is governed by the equations ( with @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 the first one relates expansion rate to the energy density @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a parameter which characterizes the spatial curvature of the universe .",
    "the second equation , when coupled with the equation of state @xmath10 which relates the pressure @xmath11 to the energy density , determines the evolution of energy density @xmath12 in terms of the expansion factor of the universe . in particular",
    "if @xmath13 with ( at least , approximately ) constant @xmath14 then , @xmath15 and ( if we further assume @xmath16 , which is strongly favoured by observations ) the first equation in eq.([frw ] ) gives @xmath17}$ ]",
    ". we will also often use the redshift @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 where the subscript zero denotes quantities evaluated at the present moment .",
    "it is convenient to measure the energy densities of different components in terms of a _",
    "critical energy density _ ( @xmath20 ) required to make @xmath16 at the present epoch .",
    "( of course , since @xmath21 is a constant , it will remain zero at all epochs if it is zero at any given moment of time . ) from eq.([frw ] ) , it is clear that @xmath22 where @xmath23  called the hubble constant  is the rate of expansion of the universe at present . the variables @xmath24 will give the fractional contribution of different components of the universe ( @xmath25 denoting baryons , dark matter , radiation , etc .",
    ") to the critical density .",
    "observations then lead to the following results :    \\(1 ) our universe has @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 can be determined from the angular anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ; see section [ sec : tempcmbr ] ) and these observations ( combined with the reasonable assumption that @xmath28 ) show@xcite that we live in a universe with critical density , so that @xmath16 .",
    "\\(2 ) observations of primordial deuterium produced in big bang nucleosynthesis ( which took place when the universe was about few minutes in age ) as well as the cmbr observations show@xcite that the _ total _ amount of baryons in the universe contributes about @xmath29 .",
    "given the independent observations@xcite which fix @xmath30 , we conclude that @xmath31 .",
    "these observations take into account all baryons which exist in the universe today irrespective of whether they are luminous or not . _",
    "combined with previous item we conclude that most of the universe is non - baryonic .",
    "_    \\(3 ) host of observations related to large scale structure and dynamics ( rotation curves of galaxies , estimate of cluster masses , gravitational lensing , galaxy surveys .. ) all suggest@xcite that the universe is populated by a non - luminous component of matter ( dark matter ; dm hereafter ) made of weakly interacting massive particles which _ does _ cluster at galactic scales .",
    "this component contributes about @xmath32 and has the simple equation of state @xmath33 .",
    "( in the relativistic theory , the pressure @xmath34 is negligible compared to energy density @xmath35 for non relativistic particles . ) . the second equation in eq.([frw ] ) , then gives @xmath36 as the universe expands which arises from the evolution of number density of particles : @xmath37    \\(4 ) combining the last observation with the first we conclude that there must be ( at least ) one more component to the energy density of the universe contributing about 70% of critical density .",
    "early analysis of several observations@xcite indicated that this component is unclustered and has negative pressure .",
    "this is confirmed dramatically by the supernova observations ( see ref .  ; for a critical look at the data , see ref .  ) .",
    "the observations suggest that the missing component has @xmath38 and contributes @xmath39 .",
    "the simplest choice for such _ dark energy _ with negative pressure is the cosmological constant which is a term that can be added to einstein s equations .",
    "this term acts like a fluid with an equation of state @xmath40 ; the second equation in eq.([frw ] ) , then gives @xmath41 constant as universe expands .",
    "\\(5 ) the universe also contains radiation contributing an energy density @xmath42 today most of which is due to photons in the cmbr .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath43 ; the second equation in eq.([frw ] ) , then gives @xmath44 .",
    "combining it with the result @xmath45 for thermal radiation , it follows that @xmath46 .",
    "radiation is dynamically irrelevant today but since @xmath47 it would have been the dominant component when the universe was smaller by a factor larger than @xmath48 .      using @xmath50 and @xmath51=constant we can write eq.([frw ] ) in a convenient dimensionless form as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; \\quad e={1\\over 2 }",

    "based on the observed composition of the universe , we can identify three distinct phases in the evolution of the universe when the temperature is less than about 100 gev . at high redshifts (",
    "small @xmath60 ) the universe is radiation dominated and @xmath61 is independent of the other cosmological parameters .",
    "then eq.([qomeganr ] ) can be easily integrated to give @xmath62 and the temperature of the universe decreases as @xmath63 .",
    "as the universe expands , a time will come when ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , say ) the matter energy density will be comparable to radiation energy density . for the parameters described above , @xmath67 . at lower redshifts , matter will dominate over radiation and we will have @xmath68 until fairly late when the dark energy density will dominate over non relativistic matter .",
    "this occurs at a redshift of @xmath69 where @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "this occurs at @xmath72 . in this phase ,",
    "the velocity @xmath61 changes from being a decreasing function to an increasing function leading to an accelerating universe ( see fig.[fig : tptrc ] ) .",
    "in addition to these , we believe that the universe probably went through a rapidly expanding , inflationary , phase very early when @xmath73 gev ; we will say more about this in section [ sec : inflation ] .",
    "( for a textbook description of these and related issues , see e.g. ref .  .",
    ")      having discussed the dynamics of the smooth universe , let us turn our attention to the formation of structures . in the conventional paradigm for the formation of structures in the universe , some mechanism is invoked to generate small perturbations in the energy density in the very early phase of the universe .",
    "these perturbations then grow due to gravitational instability and eventually form the structures which we see today .",
    "such a scenario is constrained most severely by cmbr observations at @xmath74 . since the perturbations in cmbr",
    "are observed to be small ( @xmath75 depending on the angular scale ) , it follows that the energy density perturbations were small compared to unity at the redshift of @xmath74 .    the central quantity one uses to describe the growth of structures is the _ density contrast _ defined as @xmath76/\\rho_{\\rm bg}(t)$ ] which characterizes the fractional change in the energy density compared to the background .",
    "since one is often interested in the statistical description of structures in the universe , it is conventional to assume that @xmath77 ( and other related quantities ) are elements of a statistical ensemble .",
    "many popular models of structure formation suggest that the initial density perturbations in the early universe can be represented as a gaussian random variable with zero mean and a given initial power spectrum .",
    "the latter quantity is defined through the relation @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fourier transform of @xmath80 and @xmath81 indicates averaging over the ensemble .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath82 of the density distribution is defined as the fourier transform of @xmath83 over @xmath84 .    when the @xmath85 , its evolution can be studied by linear perturbation theory and each of the spatial fourier modes @xmath86 will grow independently",
    ". then the power spectra @xmath87 at two different times in the linear regime are related by @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( called transfer function ) depends only on the parameters of the background universe ( denoted generically as `` bg '' ) but _ not _ on the initial power spectrum .",
    "the form of @xmath89 is essentially decided by two factors : ( i ) the relative magnitudes of the proper wavelength of perturbation @xmath90 and the hubble radius @xmath91 and ( ii ) whether the universe is radiation dominated or matter dominated . at sufficiently early epochs , the universe will be radiation dominated and the proper wavelength @xmath92 will be larger than @xmath93 .",
    "the density contrast of such modes , which are bigger than the hubble radius , will grow@xcite as @xmath94 until @xmath95 .",
    "( see the footnote on page . ) when this occurs , the perturbation at a given wavelength is said to enter the hubble radius .",
    "if @xmath96 and the universe is radiation dominated , the matter perturbation does not grow significantly and increases at best only logarithmically.@xcite later on , when the universe becomes matter dominated for @xmath97 , the perturbations again begin to grow .",
    "( some of these details depend on the gauge chosen for describing the physics but , of course , the final observable results are gauge independent ; we shall not worry about this feature in this article . )",
    "it follows from this description that modes with wavelengths greater than @xmath98  which enter the hubble radius only in the matter dominated epoch  continue to grow at all times ; modes with wavelengths smaller than @xmath99 suffer lack of growth ( in comparison with longer wavelength modes ) during the period @xmath100 .",
    "this fact distorts the shape of the primordial spectrum by suppressing the growth of small wavelength modes ( with @xmath101 that enter the hubble radius in the radiation dominated phase ) in comparison with longer ones , with the transition occurring at the wave number @xmath102 corresponding to the length scale @xmath103 . very roughly , the shape of @xmath104 can be characterized by the behaviour @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath109 is undistorted by the evolution since @xmath110 is essentially unity at these scales .",
    "we will see in the next section that inflationary models generate an initial power spectrum of the form @xmath111 .",
    "the evolution described above will distort it to the form @xmath112 for @xmath106 and leave it undistorted with @xmath113 for @xmath108 .",
    "the power per logarithmic band in the wavenumber , @xmath114 , is approximately constant for @xmath115 ( actually increasing as @xmath116 because of the logarithmic growth in the radiation dominated phase ) and decreases as @xmath117 at large wavelengths .",
    "it follows that @xmath118 is a monotonically decreasing function of the wavelength with more power at small length scales .",
    "when @xmath119 , linear perturbation theory breaks down at the spatial scale corresponding to @xmath120 .",
    "since there is more power at small scales , smaller scales go non - linear first and structure forms hierarchically .",
    "( observations suggest that , in today s universe scales smaller than about @xmath121 mpc are non - linear ; see fig.[fig : obs ] ) as the universe expands , the over - dense region will expand more slowly compared to the background , will reach a maximum radius , contract and virialize to form a bound nonlinear halo of dark matter .",
    "the baryons in the halo will cool and undergo collapse in a fairly complex manner because of gas dynamical processes .",
    "it seems unlikely that the baryonic collapse and galaxy formation can be understood by analytic approximations ; one needs to do high resolution computer simulations to make any progress.@xcite    the non linear evolution of the _ dark matter halos _ is somewhat different and worth mentioning because it contains the fascinating physics of statistical mechanics of self gravitating systems.@xcite the standard instability of gravitating systems in a _",
    "static _ background is moderated by the presence of a background expansion and it is possible to understand various features of nonlinear evolution of dark matter halos using different analytic approximations.@xcite among these , the existence of certain nonlinear scaling relations  which allows one to compute nonlinear power spectrum from linear power spectrum by a nonlocal scaling relation  seems to be most intriguing@xcite .",
    "if @xmath122 is the mean correlation function of dark matter particles and @xmath123 is the same quantity computed in the linear approximation , then , it turns out that @xmath122 can be expressed as a _",

    "incredibly enough , the form of @xmath126 can be determined by theory@xcite and thus allows one to understand several aspects of nonlinear clustering analytically .",
    "this topic has interesting connections with renormalisation group theory , fluid turbulence etc . and deserves the attention of wider community of physicists .",
    "we saw that the two length scales which determine the evolution of perturbations are the hubble radius @xmath127 and @xmath128 . using their definitions and eq.([frw ] ) , it is easy to show that if @xmath129 , then @xmath130 for sufficiently small @xmath131 .",
    "this result leads to a major difficulty in conventional cosmology .",
    "normal physical processes can act coherently only over length scales smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "thus any physical process leading to density perturbations at some early epoch , @xmath132 , could only have operated at scales smaller than @xmath133 .",
    "but most of the relevant astrophysical scales ( corresponding to clusters , groups , galaxies , etc . )",
    "were much bigger than @xmath134 at sufficiently early epochs .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to understand how any physical process operating in the early universe could have led to the seed perturbations in the early universe .",
    "one way of tacking this difficulty is to arrange matters such that we have @xmath135 at sufficiently small @xmath131 .",
    "since we can not do this in any model which has both @xmath129 we need to invoke some exotic physics to get around this difficulty .",
    "the standard procedure is to make @xmath5 increase rapidly with @xmath131 ( for example , exponentially or as @xmath136 with @xmath137 , which requires @xmath138 ) for a brief period of time .",
    "such a rapid growth is called  inflation \" and in conventional models of inflation,@xcite the energy density during the inflationary phase is provided by a scalar field with a potential @xmath139 . if the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy , such a scalar field can act like an ideal fluid with the equation of state @xmath140 and lead to @xmath141 during inflation .",
    "( [ fig : tpplumian ] ) shows the behaviour of the hubble radius and the wavelength @xmath142 of a generic perturbation ( line ab ) for a universe which underwent exponential inflation .",

    "for example , power law expansion of the universe [ @xmath136 ] can be generated by using a potential @xmath155 $ ] .    a more generic way of achieving this is through potentials which allow what is known as _ slow roll - over_. such potentials have a gently decreasing form for @xmath139 for a range of values for @xmath156 allowing @xmath146 to evolve very slowly . assuming a sufficiently slow evolution of @xmath146 we can ignore : ( i ) the @xmath157 term in equation and ( ii ) the kinetic energy term @xmath158 in comparison with the potential energy @xmath139 in . in this limit , ,",

    "we shall not discuss these issues and will adopt a heuristic approach , as follows :    in the desitter spacetime with @xmath166 , there is a horizon in the spacetime and associated temperature @xmath167  just as in the case of black holes.@xcite hence the scalar field will have an intrinsic rms fluctuation @xmath168 in the desitter spacetime at the scale of the hubble radius .",
    "this will cause a time shift @xmath169 in the evolution of the field between patches of the universe of size about @xmath170 .",

    "the primary anisotropies of the cmbr can be thought of as arising from three different sources ( even though such a separation is gauge dependent ) .",
    "( i ) the first is the gravitational potential fluctuations at the last scattering surface ( lss ) which will contribute an anisotropy @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the power spectrum of gravitational potential @xmath156 .",

    ", the velocity field and the density field ( leading to the doppler anisotropy and intrinsic anisotropy described in ( ii ) and ( iii ) above ) will oscillate at scales smaller than the hubble radius at the time of decoupling since pressure support due to baryons will be effective at small scales . at large scales , for a scale invariant spectrum with @xmath250 , we get : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the angular scale over which the anisotropy is measured .",
    "the fluctuations due to gravitational potential dominate at large scales while the sum of intrinsic and doppler anisotropies will dominate at small scales .",
    "since the latter two are oscillatory , we will expect an oscillatory behaviour in the temperature anisotropies at small angular scales .",
    "the typical value for the peaks of the oscillation are at about 0.3 to 0.5 degrees depending on the details of the model .",
    "the above analysis is valid if recombination was instantaneous ; but in reality the thickness of the recombination epoch is about @xmath253 .",
    "further , the coupling between the photons and baryons is not completely ` tight ' .",
    "it can be shown that@xcite these features will heavily damp the anisotropies at angular scales smaller than about 0.1 degree .",
    "the fact that different processes contribute to the structure of angular anisotropies makes cmbr a valuable tool for extracting cosmological information . to begin with , the anisotropy at very large scales directly probes modes which are bigger than the hubble radius at the time of decoupling and allows us to directly determine the primordial spectrum .",
    "the cmbr observations are _ consistent _ with the inflationary model for the generation of perturbations leading to @xmath203 and gives @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "( the first results@xcite were from cobe and later results , especially from wmap , have reconfirmed@xcite them with far greater accuracy ) .    as we move to smaller scales we are probing the behaviour of baryonic gas coupled to the photons .",
    "the pressure support of the gas leads to modulated acoustic oscillations with a characteristic wavelength at the @xmath256 surface .",
    "regions of high and low baryonic density contrast will lead to anisotropies in the temperature with the same characteristic wavelength ( which acts as a standard ruler ) leading to a series of peaks in the temperature anisotropy that have been detected .",
    "the angles subtended by these acoustic peaks will depend on the geometry of the universe and provides a reliable procedure for estimating the cosmological parameters .",
    "detailed computations@xcite show that : ( i ) the multipole index @xmath257 corresponding to the first acoustic peak has a strong , easily observable , dependence on @xmath258 and scales as @xmath259 if there is _ no _ dark energy and @xmath260 . ( ii ) but if both non - relativistic matter and dark energy is present , with @xmath261 and @xmath262 , then the peak has only a very weak dependence on @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",

    "more precisely , the current observations show that @xmath267 ; combining with @xmath28 , this result implies the existence of dark energy .",
    "the heights of acoustic peaks also contain important information .",
    "in particular , the height of the first acoustic peak relative to the second one depends sensitively on @xmath268 and the current results are consistent with that obtained from big bang nucleosynthesis.@xcite    fig.[fig : obs ] summarises the different observations of cosmological significance and the range of length scales and redshift ranges probed by them .",
    "the broken ( thin ) lines in the figure are contours of @xmath269 from bottom to top . clearly , the regions where @xmath270 corresponds to those in which nonlinear effects of structure formation is important .",

    "it is rather frustrating that we have no direct laboratory evidence for nearly 96% of matter in the universe .",
    "( actually , since we do not quite understand the process of baryogenesis , we do not understand @xmath268 either ; all we can _ theoretically _ understand now is a universe filled entirely with radiation ! ) .",

    "while the issues ( i ) and ( ii ) are by no means trivial or satisfactorily addressed , the issue of dark energy is lot more perplexing , thereby justifying the attention it has received recently .",

    "dark energy with sufficiently negative pressure will accelerate the expansion of the universe , once it starts dominating over the normal matter .",
    "this is precisely what is established from the study of high redshift supernova , which can be used to determine the expansion rate of the universe in the past.@xcite figure [ fig : tptrc ] presents the supernova data as a phase portrait@xcite of the universe .",
    "it is clear that the universe was decelerating at high redshifts and started accelerating when it was about two - third of the present size .",
    "the simplest model for a fluid with negative pressure is the cosmological constant@xcite with @xmath281 constant .",
    "if the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant , then it introduces a fundamental length scale in the theory @xmath282 , related to the constant dark energy density @xmath51 by @xmath283 . in classical general relativity ,",

    "hence we need to adjust the energy densities of normal matter and cosmological constant in the early epoch very carefully so that @xmath289 around the current epoch .",
    "because of these conceptual problems associated with the cosmological constant , people have explored a large variety of alternative possibilities .",

    "the first and last phases are time translation invariant ; that is , @xmath321 constant is an ( approximate ) invariance for the universe in these two phases .",
    "the universe satisfies the perfect cosmological principle and is in steady state during these phases ! in fact , one can easily imagine a scenario in which the two desitter phases ( first and last ) are of arbitrarily long duration.@xcite if @xmath322 the final desitter phase _ does _ last forever ; as regards the inflationary phase , one can view it as lasting for arbitrarily long duration .",
    "given the two length scales @xmath314 and @xmath285 , one can construct two energy densities @xmath323 and @xmath324 in natural units ( @xmath325 ) .",
    "the first is , of course , the planck energy density while the second one also has a natural interpretation .",
    "the universe which is asymptotically desitter has a horizon and associated thermodynamics@xcite with a temperature @xmath326 and the corresponding thermal energy density @xmath327 .",

    "while the two desitter phases can last forever in principle , there is a natural cut off length scale in both of them which makes the region of physical relevance to be finite.@xcite in the the case of re - inflation in the late universe , this happens ( at point f ) when the temperature of the cmbr radiation drops below the desitter temperature .",
    "the universe will be essentially dominated by the vacuum thermal noise of the desitter phase for @xmath332 .",
    "one can easily determine the dynamic range of df to be @xmath333 a natural bound on the duration of inflation arises for a different reason .",

    "the phases ce and df are approximately equal .",
    "the region in the quadrilateral cedf is the most relevant part of standard cosmology , though the evolution of the universe can extend to arbitrarily large stretches in both directions in time .",
    "this figure is definitely telling us something regarding the time translation invariance of the universe ( ` the perfect cosmological principle ' ) and  more importantly  _ about the breaking of this symmetry _ , and it deserves more attention than it has received .",
    "let us now turn to several other features related to the cosmological constant .",
    "non - representative _ sample of attempts to understand / explain the cosmological constant  include those based on qft in curved space time,@xcite those based on renormalisation group arguments,@xcite quantum cosmological considerations,@xcite various cancellation mechanisms@xcite and many others .",
    "a study of these ( failures ! ) reveals the following :    \\(a ) if observed dark energy is due to cosmological constant , we need to explain the small value of the dimensionless number @xmath341 .",
    "the presence of @xmath342 clearly indicates that we are dealing with quantum mechanical problem , coupled to gravity . any purely classical solution ( like a classically decaying cosmological constant )",
    "will require ( hidden or explicit ) fine - tuning .",
    "at the same time , this is clearly an infra - red issue , in the sense that the phenomenon occurs at extremely low energies!.    \\(b ) in addition to the zero - point energy of vacuum fluctuations ( which _ must _",
    "gravitate@xcite ) the phase transitions in the early universe ( at least the well established electro - weak transition ) change the ground state energy by a large factor .",
    "_ it is necessary to arrange matters so that gravity does not respond to such changes . _",
    "any approach to cosmological constant  which does not take this factor into account is fundamentally flawed .",
    "\\(c ) an immediate consequence is that , the gravitational degrees of freedom which couple to cosmological constant  must have a special status and behave in a manner different from other degrees of freedom .",
    "( the non linear coupling of matter with gravity has several subtleties ; see eg .",
    ") if , for example , we have a theory in which the source of gravity is @xmath343 rather than @xmath344 , then cosmological constant  will not couple to gravity at all . unfortunately it is not possible to develop a covariant theory of gravity using @xmath343 as the source .",
    "but we can achieve the same objective in different manner .",
    "any metric @xmath345 can be expressed in the form @xmath346 such that @xmath347 so that @xmath348 . from the action functional for gravity",
    "@xmath349 it is obvious that the cosmological constant  couples _ only _ to the conformal factor @xmath350 .",
    "so if we consider a theory of gravity in which @xmath351 is kept constant and only @xmath352 is varied , then such a model will be oblivious of direct coupling to cosmological constant  and will not respond to changes in bulk vacuum energy . if the action ( without the @xmath353 term ) is varied , keeping @xmath354 , say , then one is lead to a _ unimodular theory of gravity _ with the equations of motion @xmath355 with zero trace on both sides . using the bianchi identity , it is now easy to show that this is equivalent to a theory with an _ arbitrary _ cosmological constant .",
    "that is , cosmological constant  arises as an ( undetermined ) integration constant in this model.@xcite unfortunately , we still need an extra physical principle to fix its value .",
    "\\(d ) the conventional discussion of the relation between cosmological constant and the zero point energy is too simplistic since the zero point energy has no observable consequence .",
    "the observed non trivial features of the vacuum state arise from the _ fluctuations _ ( or modifications ) of this vacuum energy .",
    "( this was , in fact , known fairly early in the history of cosmological constant problem ; see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "if the vacuum probed by the gravity can readjust to take away the bulk energy density @xmath356 , quantum _ fluctuations _ can generate the observed value @xmath357 .",
    "one of the simplest models@xcite which achieves this uses the fact that , in the semiclassical limit , the wave function describing the universe of proper four - volume @xmath358 will vary as @xmath359 $ ] . if we treat @xmath360 as conjugate variables then uncertainty principle suggests @xmath361 .",
    "if the four volume is built out of planck scale substructures , giving @xmath362 , then the poisson fluctuations will lead to @xmath363 giving @xmath364 .",
    "( this idea can be made more quantitative@xcite . )    in fact , it is _ inevitable _ that in a universe with two length scale @xmath365 , the vacuum fluctuations will contribute an energy density of the correct order of magnitude @xmath328 .",
    "the hierarchy of energy scales in such a universe has@xcite the pattern @xmath366 the first term is the bulk energy density which needs to be renormalized away ( by a process which we do not understand at present ) ; the third term is just the thermal energy density of the desitter vacuum state ; what is interesting is that quantum fluctuations in the matter fields _ inevitably generate _ the second term .",
    "a rigorous calculation@xcite of the dispersion in the energy shows that the _ fluctuations _ in the energy density @xmath367 , inside a region bounded by a cosmological horizon , is given by @xmath368 the numerical coefficient will depend on the precise nature of infrared cutoff radius ( like whether it is @xmath285 or @xmath369 etc . ) .",
    "but _ one can not get away from _ a fluctuation of magnitude @xmath370 that will exist in the energy density inside a sphere of radius @xmath371 if planck length is the uv cut off . since observations suggest that there is indeed a @xmath372 of _ similar _ magnitude in the universe , it seems natural to identify the two , after subtracting out the mean value for reasons which we do not understand .",
    "this approach explains why there is a _ surviving _ cosmological constant which satisfies @xmath328 but not why the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ energyhier ] ) should be removed .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that ` parametrised cosmology ' , which attempts to describe the evolution of the universe in terms of a small number of parameters , has made considerable progress in recent years . having done this , it is tempting to ask more ambitious questions , some of which we will briefly discuss in this section .",
    "there are two obvious questions a cosmologist faces every time ( s)he gives a popular talk , for which ( s)he has no answer ! the first one is : _ why do the parameters of the universe have the values they have ? _ today , we have no clue why the real universe follows one template out of a class of models all of which are permitted by the known laws of physics ( just as we have no idea why there are three families of leptons with specified mass ratios etc . ) of the different cosmological parameters , @xmath373 as well as the parameters of the initial power spectrum @xmath374 should arise from viable particle physics models which actually says something about phenomenology .",
    "( unfortunately , these research areas are not currently very fashionable . ) on the other hand , it is not clear how we can understand @xmath274 without a reasonably detailed model for quantum gravity .",
    "_ in fact , the acid test for any viable quantum gravity model is whether it has something nontrivial to say about _",
    "@xmath274 ; all the current candidates have nothing to offer on this issue and thus fail the test .",
    "the second question is : _ how ( and why ! ) was the universe created and what happened before the big bang ? _",
    "the cosmologist giving the public lecture usually mumbles something about requiring a quantum gravity model to circumvent the classical singularity  but we really have no idea!. string theory offers no insight ; the implications of loop quantum gravity for quantum cosmology have attracted fair mount of attention recently@xcite but it is fair to say we still do not know how ( and why ) the universe came into being .    what is not often realised is that _ certain aspects of this problem transcends the question of technical tractability of quantum gravity _ and",
    "can be presented in more general terms .",
    "suppose , for example , one has produced some kind of theory for quantum gravity .",
    "such a theory is likely to come with a single length scale @xmath314 .",
    "even when one has the back drop of such a theory , it is not clear how one hopes to address questions like : ( a ) why is our universe much bigger than @xmath314 which is the only scale in the problem i.e. , why is the mean curvature of the universe much smaller than @xmath375 ? ( b ) how does the universe , treated as a dynamical system , evolve _ spontaneously _ from a quantum regime to classical regime ? ( c ) how does one obtain the notion of a cosmological arrow of time , starting from timeless or at least time symmetric description ?",
    "one viable idea regarding these issues seems to be based on vacuum instability which describes the universe as an unstable system with an unbounded hamiltonian .",
    "then it is possible for the expectation value of spatial curvature to vary monotonically as , say , @xmath376 with some index @xmath234 , as the universe expands in an unstable mode .",
    "since the conformal factor of the metric has the ` wrong ' sign for the kinetic energy term , this mode will become semiclassical first .",
    "even then it is not clear how the arrow of time related to the expanding phase of the universe arises ; one needs to invoke decoherence like arguments to explain the classical limit@xcite and the situation is not very satisfactory .    while the understanding of such ` deeper ' issues might require the _ details _ of the viable model for quantum gravity , one should not ignore the alternative possibility that we are just not clever enough .",
    "it may turn out that certain obvious ( low energy ) features of the universe , that we take for granted , contain clues to the full theory of quantum gravity ( just as the equality of inertial and gravitational masses , known for centuries , was turned on its head by einstein s insight ) if only we manage to find the right questions to ask . to illustrate this point , consider an atomic physicist who solves the schrodinger equation for the electrons in the helium atom .",
    "( s)he will discover that , of all the permissible solutions , only half ( which are antisymmetric under the exchange of electrons ) are realized in nature though the hamiltonian of the helium atom offers no insight for this feature .",
    "this is a low energy phenomenon the explanation of which lies deep inside relativistic field theory .",
    "\\(i ) the first one , which is already mentioned , is the fact that our universe seemed to have evolved _",
    "spontaneously _ from a quantum regime to classical regime bringing with it the notion of a cosmological arrow of time.@xcite this is not a generic feature of dynamical systems ( and is connected with the fact that the hamiltonian for the system is unbounded from below ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the second issue corresponds to the low energy vacuum state of matter fields in the universe and the notion of the particle  which is an excitation around this vacuum state .",
    "observations show that , in the classical limit , we do have the notion of an inertial frame , vacuum state and a notion of the particle such that the particle at rest in this frame will see , say , the cmbr as isotropic .",
    "this is nontrivial , since the notion of classical particle arises after several limits are taken : given the formal quantum state @xmath377 $ ] of gravity and matter , one would first proceed to a limit of quantum fields in curved background , in which the gravity is treated as a c - number@xcite . further taking the @xmath378 limit ( to obtain quantum mechanics ) and @xmath379 limit ( to obtain the classical limit ) one will reach the notion of a particle in classical theory . miraculously enough , the full quantum state of the universe seems to finally select ( in the low energy classical limit ) a local inertial frame , such that the particle at rest in this frame will see the universe as isotropic  rather than the universe as accelerating or rotating , say .",
    "this is a nontrivial constraint on @xmath377 $ ] , especially since the vacuum state and particle concept are ill defined in the curved background@xcite .",
    "one can show that this feature imposes special conditions on the wave function of the universe@xcite in simple minisuperspace models but its wider implications in quantum gravity are unexplored .",
