    "guiding of light at metal - dielectric interfaces has attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to the subwavelength light confinement achievable by excitation of propagating surface - plasmon polariton ( spp ) modes .",
    "@xcite spp guiding in a number of configurations is not limited by the diffraction limit , allowing for the manipulation and concentration of light on the nanoscale .",
    "@xcite at the same time , stronger spp mode confinement is typically associated with stronger mode absorption in metal , resulting in a trade - off between light confinement and propagation distances .",
    "@xcite this trade - off can be tailored by considering various waveguide structures , where especially waveguides based on thin metal films or narrow dielectric gaps between two metal surfaces have shown to provide a considerably better trade - off .",

    "the key property of the imi waveguide is its ability to support the so - called long - range spp mode , which exhibits considerably low propagation loss .",
    "furthermore , the mim configuration forms the basis for the effective - index modeling ( eim ) technique of more complex waveguiding structures , such as v - groove , slot and trench waveguides .",

    "the lra solutions for the mim and imi structures were determined very early by economou  @xcite and comprise two spp modes being of even and odd symmetry with respect to the electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "the properties of these modes are determined by their respective dispersion relations , i.e. by the relations between the frequency @xmath0 and the spp propagation constant @xmath1 , which are given by transcendental equations . in the nonretarded limit of the lra , the surface modes of the mim and imi structures become identical ,  @xcite which is an interesting property that stems from babinet s principle of complementary structures .",
    "@xcite    however , issues with the approach of the lra arise when either considering large values of @xmath1 , where an unphysical limit is found for the frequency , or considering narrow insulator or metal widths ( @xmath2  nm ) , where singularities occur .",
    "@xcite in particular when investigating extremely narrow v - grooves , as recently realized experimentally ,  @xcite with techniques such as eim , the inadequacy of the lra manifests itself .",

    "( [ eq : mimklimit ] ) and ( [ eq : imiklimit ] ) , respectively . using a pad approximation",
    ", we find to the lowest order in @xmath43 that @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltak ] ) we clearly see that in the absence of nonlocal response ( @xmath112 ) , the difference between the fundamental modes of the mim and imi waveguides vanishes .",
    "additionally , we observe that the dispersion - difference depends strongly on the width . at very narrow widths ,",
    "we therefore expect a strong breaking of complementarity .",
    "thus , in the presence of nonlocality , a thin film of electron gas embedded in an insulator behaves qualitatively different from a thin insulator gap embedded in an electron gas .    in an intuitive , but simplified picture of nonlocality",
    ", one could be inclined to attribute the complementarity breaking to the nonlocal smearing of the induced surface charge . in the nonlocal hydrodynamic model the induced surface charge",
    "is smeared over a length scale comparable to the thomas  fermi screening length , leading to an effective width increase ( decrease ) for the mim ( imi ) waveguide . in this picture the dispersion relations of the nonlocal imi and mim spp modes should then be below and above the local dispersion relations , respectively , which is not the case , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) . in fact the nonlocal imi and mim spp modes are always above the local results , discrediting the simple interpretation of nonlocal response as local response with effective size parameters .",
    "the complementarity breaking originates from the inclusion of pressure waves in the description of a metal with nonlocal response .",
    "more precisely , the breaking is due to the confinement of these pressure waves in the imi waveguide , which becomes more important for narrower widths .",
    "this confinement results in a significantly different description of the imi waveguide compared to the mim waveguide , where the pressure waves are not confined . for this reason ,",
    "nonlocal effects are also stronger in the imi waveguide , as can be seen from the presence of only the nonlocal imi correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltak ] ) .",
    "in contrast in the non - retarded lra , the absence of both retardation and the pressure waves leads to a faulty identical treatment of the mim and imi waveguides .",
    "the effects of nonlocal response , described by a linearized hydrodynamic model , on the waveguiding properties of the mi , mim , and imi waveguides have been investigated .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations for the three waveguides have been derived , taking into account nonlocality , interband transitions , and retardation .",
    "the intriguing transition from nonlocal- to loss - dominated waveguiding behavior , which has not previously been studied extensively , was examined for the mi system , demonstrating that nonlocal response can counteract the effects of low metal losses . in the lra",
    "the presence of even minute losses drastically alters the dispersion relation of the spp mode due the slow - light regime at the surface plasmon frequency @xmath72 . for larger losses ,",
    "the effects of nonlocality in the mi structure is less important , and the difference between local and nonlocal response becomes negligible . in general , for the mi structure , the impact of metal losses is much more pronounced than that of nonlocal effects , partially due to the high losses in metals and partially due to the absence of any geometric length scale in the mi structure .",
    "conversely , for the mim and imi structures , the presence of an additional length scale , given by the geometric width of the waveguide , yields a comparative boost to the effect of nonlocality vis -  - vis the effect of metal losses . in turn",
    ", the increased strength of nonlocality gives rise to larger propagation constants and thereby an increased plasmonic confinement of the spp modes .",
    "nonlocal effects are shown to be slightly stronger in the imi waveguide due to the presence of confined longitudinal pressure waves , which are absent in the mim structure .",
    "lastly , we also examined the complementarity property of the mim and imi waveguides in the context of babinet s principle . in the non - retarded limit of the lra ,",
    "the waveguide modes of the mim and imi modes are known to be identical . when retardation is taken into account ,",
    "this symmetry is broken .",
    "in addition , we have shown that in the nonretarded limit the symmetry is also broken by the inclusion of nonlocal effects due to the presence of nonlocal pressure waves .    _",
