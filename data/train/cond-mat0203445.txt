    "ferrofluids ( dipolar magnetic fluids ) are colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic particles of about @xmath0 diameter dispersed in a carrier liquid @xcite that are usually stabilized against agglomeration by coating particles with long - chain molecules ( sterically ) or decorating them with charged groups ( electrostatically ) .",

    "eq.([langevinm ] ) leads to curie s law for the initial susceptibility @xmath11 which depends linearly on the particle concentration @xmath12 however , experiments on concentrated ferrofluids have revealed an essential deviation from the langevin formula @xcite .",
    "the initial susceptibility increases with the particle concentration much faster than that predicted in eq.([langsus ] ) .",

    "a reduced time step @xmath79 was employed in all simulations .",
    "the runs were started from initial configurations with random particle positions and dipole moment orientations . for each case , the system was at first equilibrated for a period of 50 000 time steps .",
    "the magnetization and structural properties were then calculated from the data for another period of at least 200 000 time steps .",
    "error bars for the simulation results were determined by dividing the simulation runs into blocks of 10 000 time steps and calculating an estimate for the standard deviation of the mean @xcite .",

    ", we consider a ferrofluid sample consisting of monodispersed magnetite particles .",
    "the bulk magnetization of this material is @xmath85 a / m . with a magnetic core diameter of the particles of @xmath86 nm , the value of @xmath23 amounts to about @xmath87 at room temperature @xmath88 . for larger particles with @xmath89 nm , @xmath23 rises up to @xmath90 under the same conditions .",
    "note that @xmath23 may further be enlarged by decreasing the temperature or using cobalt as working material ( @xmath91 a / m ) , for which the previous @xmath23-values increase by a factor of around @xmath92 .",
    "we therefore also carried out some simulations for @xmath93 .    in all simulations , we fixed the root mean square ( rms ) absolute errors in the dipolar forces to @xmath94 , which corresponds to @xmath95 of the attractive force between two contacting particles with dipole moments in parallel alignment .",

    "the influence of the particle interactions on the magnetic properties is most evident at weak fields , so we start with the investigation of the initial susceptibility @xmath20 .",

    "as expected , the calculation of @xmath21 at @xmath112 does not show the existence of a spontaneous magnetization , because @xmath22 is still not high enough .",
    "other works @xcite have shown that the transition to a ferromagnetic state occurs at @xmath113 for @xmath114 . for higher values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the critical concentration is around @xmath115 for @xmath116 @xcite and @xmath117 for @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "these conditions are clearly not encountered in our simulations .",

    "the results for other values of @xmath23 display a similar behavior .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath121 at first increases linearly with @xmath63 , then at higher field values sub - linearly .",
    "we introduce @xmath122 as a definition for the maximum value of @xmath63 where @xmath121 still can be considered to obey the linear relationship . evidently , at a fixed value of @xmath23",
    "this @xmath122-value decreases with growing @xmath22 .",
    "the data in fig.1 show that when @xmath22 is increased from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , @xmath122 decreases from @xmath125 to about @xmath126 . on the other hand , at a fixed particle concentration ,",
    "rising @xmath23 also implies a reduction of @xmath122 .",
    "this demonstrates that the range over which @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath7 ( or equivalently @xmath63 ) shrinks with the increase of @xmath11 . for a quantitative evaluation of the initial susceptibility",
    "we need to determine the linear region for each case separately .",
    "this is accomplished with the help of a linear regression fit with error weighting @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of that method is to minimize the so - called @xmath127-square merit function @xmath128 so as to get @xmath20 and its error bar . here",
    "@xmath129 is the error bar related to the simulation data of @xmath130 . in fig.1 the data were taken with a step size of @xmath131 giving @xmath132 data points on each curve . since no spontaneous magnetization occurs , the initial data point is always at @xmath133 . for each curve ,",
    "a series of linear fittings was generated by increasing @xmath134 in eq.([regression ] ) from @xmath135 to @xmath132 .",
    "the fit which gives the minimum value of @xmath136 per degree of freedom is taken to be the optimum linear fitting to the data .",
    "the associated @xmath134-value is referred as @xmath137 .",
    "the slope @xmath20 and its error bar @xmath138 determine the initial susceptibility .",
    "the value of @xmath122 is roughly given by the product of @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "the results of this data fit including the error estimates are compiled in table.i .",
    "the degree of reliability of the results is reflected by the high goodness - probability @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "the resulting straight lines @xmath142 , or in dimensionless form @xmath143 , are also displayed in fig.1 to show how they fit to the simulation data .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows the calculated initial susceptibility @xmath20 as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath22 , along with the analytical results from eqs.([sus2ord ] ) and ( [ sus3ord ] ) .",
    "since the langevin susceptibility @xmath11 has been taken as the universal parameter in these theoretical predictions @xcite , we also map the data of @xmath20 on @xmath11 in fig.2(b ) to show the scaling behavior more directly .",
    "in addition to the results in fig.2(a ) , some more data was produced at higher concentrations ( up to @xmath144 ) for the case of @xmath145 in order to get a larger range of @xmath11 .",
    "we did not combine such high concentrations with larger values of @xmath23 , since the close proximity to the magnetic phase separation would make the discussion more complex , rendering the results more sensitive to the specific short - range interaction .    for the weak interaction range",
    "@xmath146 we find perfect agreement with eqs.([sus2ord ] ) and ( [ sus3ord ] ) for all investigated volume fractions . actually ,",
    "because for these coupling parameters we can reach only up to @xmath147 , both analytical predictions yield equally good results for our data and are indistinguishable within the error bars .",
    "for @xmath148 we see small but significant deviations at low values of @xmath22 , meaning that already at low values of @xmath11 neither eqs.([sus2ord ] ) nor ( [ sus3ord ] ) are accurate .",
    "however , at high volume fractions ( @xmath149 ) , the third order equation ( [ sus3ord ] ) is compatible within error bars . for the numerical values of the data",
    "see table  1 , where also the values of the analytical results for different orders are given for comparison .",
    "even more drastic deviations from the theoretical predictions are found for @xmath150 at low concentrations , in the range @xmath151 .",
    "we observe again the trend , that at higher volume fractions the third order equation ( [ sus3ord ] ) becomes compatible with our data .",
    "we can conclude that the parameter @xmath23 , rather than @xmath11 , becomes the dominating control parameter for @xmath26 .",
    "this effect can be attributed directly to the microstructure formation in the system . when @xmath152 , what we consider to be the weak interaction limit , the dipolar potential is comparable to the thermal fluctuation .",
    "then the interparticle correlations are weak , and the present theoretical models work well . however , going to stronger interactions with @xmath26 , leads to a considerable amount of particle aggregation .",
    "the resulting clusters amplify the sensitivity of the system to weak external magnetic fields and thus lead to an enhanced magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we will come back to this point in sec .",
    "[ subsec : micro ] .",
    "the influence of the volume fraction seems to be weak in the investigated parameter regime .",
    "noteworthy is that the third order equation seems to describe the available data well at larger volume fraction and high coupling parameter @xmath23 , even better than it does at intermediate values .",
    "on the basis of our available data we can not decide if this finding is a mere coincidence . to our knowledge there is no theoretical reason to believe that the third order equation should become reliable again at these high values of @xmath11 , where higher order corrections of the form @xmath153 with @xmath5 , @xmath154 arbitrary , are expected to become important .",
    "corrections linear in @xmath22 , but up to ninth order in @xmath23 have been assembled for the born - mayer expansion method in ref . .",
    "these additional terms are all positive and therefore necessarily increase the susceptibility .",
    "we have found that they improve the theoretical prediction of @xmath20 only at very small concentrations ( @xmath155 ) for @xmath26 , but they dramatically overestimate the simulation results at larger values of @xmath22 .    note that the simulations presented in ref",
    ". give rise to a susceptibility @xmath20 that _ decreases _ with growing @xmath23 if @xmath11 is fixed , which is _ opposite _ to our findings in fig.2(b ) .",
    "we suspect that this trend may be induced by finite size effects , since a _ finite _ spherical simulation volume with only a few hundred particles had been used in their simulations ( without a periodic replication to properly account for the long range dipolar interaction as is done in the present work ) .",
    "we shall clarify this point in a subsequent publication@xcite .",
    "in this section , we extend the calculation of @xmath21 to a larger range of the applied external field strength @xmath63 in order to get the full magnetization curves . for moderately concentrated ferrofluids , the ` modified mean - field model '",
    "@xcite describes the magnetization curve in terms of the langevin magnetization @xmath156 [ eq.([langevinm ] ) ] as follows @xmath157 where the effective field acting on an individual ferro - particle is given by @xmath158 rather than @xmath159 as done in the weiss model .",
    "the resulting expression for the initial susceptibility is eq.([sus2ord ] ) .",
    "a higher order description is obtained by replacing @xmath160 in eq.([magz2ord ] ) by @xmath161 which in the weak field limit reduces to eq.([sus3ord ] ) for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the effective langevin parameters corresponding to eqs.([magz2ord ] ) and ( [ magz3ord ] ) can be written as @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "this reflects the @xmath11-dependence of these two theoretical predictions .",
    "the born - mayer expansion described @xmath20 in a different way , where its dependence on @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given separately @xcite .",
    "we investigated the magnetization curves for two different cases .",
    "in the first case @xmath11 is fixed to a small value of @xmath164 where the predictions using eqs.([magz2ord ] ) and ( [ magz3ord ] ) practically coincide .",
    "then @xmath23 is taken to be @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively . to keep @xmath11 constant ,",
    "the volume fraction @xmath22 had to be adapted from @xmath167 down to @xmath168 . in the second case",
    ", we take a larger value of @xmath169 which makes the difference between the two theoretical predictions distinguishable by a few percentage . only @xmath120 and @xmath84 are discussed .",
    "the corresponding volume fractions are @xmath170 and @xmath167 , respectively . in the latter case",
    ", we did not include the results for @xmath152 due to the limitation of the particle concentrations and for @xmath93 due to the extremely slow dynamics which prohibited us from reaching equilibrium distributions within our computational limits .",
    "the calculated magnetization curves are shown in fig.3 together with the theoretical predictions using eqs.([magzthe]-[magz3ord ] ) . for a more explicit demonstration of the particle interaction the inlays display the difference between the simulation data and the langevin model @xmath171 .",
    "the characteristic maximum of this difference is found to be at intermediate field strength of @xmath172 , where it may reach more than @xmath173 . the results in fig.3(a )",
    "reveal again the essential role of the dipolar coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath23 equals @xmath174 and @xmath175 , the simulation and theoretical curves agree with each other very well .",
    "but for larger @xmath23 the calculated magnetization @xmath21 rises with @xmath63 much faster than the theoretical predictions , especially in the weak field regime .",
    "this reflects the same result already observed in fig.2 , that @xmath20 increases with @xmath23 at low and moderate concentrations if @xmath11 is held fixed . due to this effect ,",
    "the peak positions of the increment @xmath171 shift to smaller values of @xmath63 with the increase of @xmath23 . in fig.3(b ) , the volume fraction of the particles are relatively high .",
    "the maximum absolute difference between the two analytical predictions occurs at @xmath176 where the result given by using eq.([magz3ord ] ) is about @xmath177 larger than that by eq.([magz2ord ] ) .",
    "our simulation results are found to be consistent with both of them within the range of error bar .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the data indicates that eq.([magz3ord ] ) gives a better description in the weak field regime .",
    "this consequently leads to a better agreement between the simulation results on @xmath20 with the prediction of eq.([sus3ord ] ) .",
    "however , both data sets for @xmath120 and @xmath114 show deviations from the theoretical curves at larger values of @xmath63 which can not be explained by statistical errors .",
    "also here we infer that higher order corrections are needed to more accurately describe the magnetization curves .",
    "the microstructure and its relation to the magnetic properties of ferrofluids are investigated by performing a cluster analysis . in conventional cluster analysis , agglomerates are usually defined on the base of the spatial proximity between the particles or by means of an energy criterion . for ferrofluids",
    "the latter one is more favorable , because the anisotropic dipolar interaction implies that two neighboring particles can form a stable bonding only if their dipole moments are roughly aligned in head - to - tail orientation .",
    "the energetically based cluster analysis of ferrofluids has been done in several different ways @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the definition of refs . and where two particles are considered to be bound if their dipolar potential energy is less than a predetermined value @xmath178 .",
    "the influence of using different threshold values for @xmath178 has been investigated in a recent work @xcite .",

    "we have varied @xmath178 from @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",
    "only slight quantitative changes of the results have been found without a qualitative difference .",
    "the results shown here have been evaluated for @xmath183 , i. e. , @xmath184 of the contact energy of two perfectly co - aligned dipolar particles .",
    "the above cluster definition implies that aggregates are mainly linear chains and rings .",
    "thicker particle agglomerates or branched chains , however , occur very rarely in our simulations .",
    "the size of a cluster is defined as the number of particles belonging to it .",
    "we first set up the connectivity matrix by means of our cluster definition , and then use it to evaluate the sizes and numbers of clusters in a given configuration .",
    "the average cluster size is defined by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the number of clusters having size @xmath187 , and the triangular brackets denote the time average , or equivalently , the average over the configuration space .",
    "fig.4 plots @xmath188 as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath22 for the case of zero field ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "clearly , increasing the dipolar coupling @xmath23 leads to a larger cluster size @xmath188 .",
    "however , in the weak coupling limit @xmath145 or @xmath175 , @xmath188 exceeds @xmath174 only slightly , meaning that there are very few dimers present .",
    "inter - particle correlations seem to be weak and we already noted that the simulation results agree well with the theoretical models in these cases .    as @xmath23",
    "is increased , the larger values of @xmath188 indicate the formation of more clusters . to elucidate this , we show snapshots of the three - dimensional configurations in fig.5 for the case of @xmath189 ( @xmath96 ) at different @xmath23 values .",
    "the increase of the number and size of clusters with @xmath23 can be seen clearly in these figures .",
    "for @xmath120 we find @xmath190 at @xmath189 . about @xmath191 of the particles",
    "are organized in dimers and less than @xmath192 in trimers . at the same density , @xmath188 increases to @xmath193 for @xmath114 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath194 of the particles are in dimers , @xmath195 in trimers and @xmath196 in quadrumers .",
    "the density dependence of these numbers is shown in fig.6 where the average percentage of particles in @xmath154-mers are plotted as a function of @xmath22 for @xmath120 and @xmath84 .",
    "it can be seen that more than @xmath197 of the particles are still in monomers and the clusters with @xmath198 are rarely found in these cases .",
    "however , when @xmath23 equals to @xmath166 , all the particles get involved in the formation of long chain - like structures .",
    "the average chain length is larger than @xmath199 at @xmath189 . due to thermal fluctuations , these chains are quite flexible .",
    "they are continuously breaking and recombining with others @xcite .",
    "even closed ring structures can be observed occasionally . in this strong coupling case ,",
    "the chains have a close analogy to living polymers @xcite .",
    "when the external field is switched on , the tendency of the dipole moments to co - align with the field direction enhances the aggregation probability .",
    "accordingly the average cluster size is expected to increase with the field strength .",
    "fig.7 shows the field - dependence of @xmath188 for the systems studied in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the increment of @xmath188 with @xmath63 is only very weak for @xmath200 , but it is more evident at @xmath114 .",
    "as exhibited in fig.8 , the structure character of the system varies from randomly distributed short clusters to string - like alignments along the magnetic flux with the increase of @xmath63 .",
    "consequently the cluster analysis in fig.9 reflects that more and more particles merge into larger aggregates .",
    "cluster as long as @xmath201 could be observed at high @xmath63 .",
    "but these string - like structures in fig.8(d ) are much more unstable than the chains formed at @xmath93 [ see fig.5(d ) ] .",
    "they posses a smaller contact energy so that thermal fluctuations can easily break long clusters into smaller segments .",
    "this effect is field - independent .",
    "in fact , most of the strings observed in fig.8(d ) consist of a few continuously breaking and recombining segments . as a result",
    ", the average cluster size @xmath188 does not present a dramatic change as expected from the snapshot of the configurations .",
    "when @xmath93 , however , the long - chains had already been formed even at zero field .",
    "the increase of the field strength just arrange these chains to have a better alignment along the field direction .",
    "but the average chain length does not change too much .",
    "the results in fig.7 reveal that the magnetic field dependence of @xmath188 remains weak at small @xmath63 .",
    "it is therefore legal to invoke the zero - field cluster analysis in order to interpret the outcomes related to the initial susceptibility ( fig.2 ) .",
    "let us focus to the cases of @xmath120 and @xmath84 at low concentrations where the deviation between theory and simulation are most pronounced . in these cases",
    "the small clusters are relatively stable and spatially well separated from each other . for a rough approximation , we treat the clusters as rigid particles thus considering our system as a poly - dispersed sample .",
    "we define the effective dipole moment of each cluster according to @xmath202 the effective langevin susceptibility @xmath203 of such a poly - dispersed system can be computed as @xmath204 since most of the clusters are short linear @xmath154-mers , the value of @xmath203 is larger than @xmath11 - the appropriate value for the mono - dispersed system . replacing @xmath11 by @xmath203 in eq.([sus3ord ] ) we get new modified theoretical curves . in fig.10",
    "it can be seen that this simple operating prescription considerably improves the agreement between simulation and theory , at least at low concentrations .",
    "this proves that the formation of small clusters is responsible for the enhancement of the initial susceptibility .    at particle concentration above @xmath205 ,",
    "the modified theoretical curves start to overestimate the simulated @xmath20-values . in these cases ,",
    "the increased angular correlations between the particles are not just limited to the two next nearest neighbors and thus make the above definition of clusters ambiguous @xcite .",
    "although we keep on using the energy criterion to obtain the cluster informations for fig.4 and 6 , these values are more likely reflecting the local orientational order of the dipole moments .",
    "the clusters we find are not stable entities involving well - defined particle numbers as in the low density regime .",
    "this can be partially seen from the @xmath206 behavior in fig.4 . when @xmath200 , @xmath188 slightly increases with @xmath22 .",
    "but it saturates at @xmath114 and even decreases at @xmath93 for @xmath207 .",
    "next we examine the radial distribution function @xmath208 of the system ( fig.11 ) , which gives the probability of finding a pair of particles a distance @xmath209 apart , relative to the probability expected for a completely random distribution at the same density@xcite .",
    "we find that the height of the first and second peaks , respectively , associated with dimer and trimers , decrease with the increase of @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the number of clusters does not increase as rapidly as the density @xcite . in other words , upon rising @xmath22 the spatial distribution of the particle positions re - approaches to that of a homogeneous system .",
    "therefore we expect our suggested modification with eq.([langsuseff ] ) only to be valid at low volume fractions below @xmath210 .",
    "the formation of long chain - like structures in the strong coupling regime makes the systematic investigation of the magnetization properties at @xmath93 difficult . at @xmath211 , there are very few overlaps between the elongated chains .",
    "they have enough free volume to re - arrange in response to the external field .",
    "the magnetization of the system increases very fast in the weak field regime , as shown in fig.3(a ) .",
    "the occasional formation of a few closed ring structures is not found to affect noticeably the global magnetization behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath22 is enlarged , the chains become strongly entangled , like in a semi - flexible polymer solution .",
    "this slows down the dynamics of the system dramatically .",
    "an extremely long simulation time is required to reach the equilibrium state in the weak field regime .",
    "for example , at a density of @xmath212 , the equilibrium value of @xmath107 at @xmath213 is obtained only after 1.5 million simulation time steps .",
    "simultaneously , since the number of particles is fixed in our simulation , the increase of @xmath22 makes the chain length become comparable to the size of the simulation box .",
    "this unavoidably induces finite size effects .",
    "for these reasons , we were unable to provide systematic investigations at @xmath93 at higher concentrations ( or equivalently larger @xmath11 ) , but only for @xmath214 shown in fig.3(a ) .",
    "these numerical difficulties could well be related to experimental observations which find a dramatic increase of viscosities at similar dipolar couplings @xcite .      to further investigate the influence of the cluster formation process we now turn to ferro - solid systems . by this",
    "we denote a suspension of dipolar particles which have their spatial positions frozen in , but are permitted to rotate freely . in this way the aggregation related effects in ferrofluids can easily be separated .",
    "we prepared the initial configurations of the ferro - solid system by placing the particles randomly in the simulation box with random dipole moment orientations .",
    "for each given @xmath23 and @xmath22 , several different initial configurations were generated and simulated .",
    "they were found to give very similar results .",
    "computer time limitations prohibited us to average over a large sequence of quenched configurations , which would be desirable to obtain a good ensemble average for a ferro - glass system .",
    "however , we have investigated this case only to study the qualitative influence of freezing the positional degrees of freedom .",
    "accordingly , only the rotational equations of motion [ eq.([langevinr ] ) ] of the particles need to be integrated in the simulations .",
    "fig.12 displays the simulation results for the initial susceptibility at @xmath120 and @xmath84 , along with the theoretical predictions for the fluid system . in ferro - solids @xmath20",
    "also exhibits a nonlinear increase with the volume fraction @xmath22 . comparing our data with the results of the ferrofluid system in fig.2",
    ", we see that the suppression of clusters leads to a slower increase of the magnetization at weak fields , and hence to a lower @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the discrepancy between @xmath215 and @xmath216 goes up when @xmath23 or @xmath22 are increased .",
    "this shows that the positional correlations are also very important at high density , and couple strongly to the dipolar rotational degrees of freedom , even if they do not evidently form stable clusters .",
    "we consider the fact that the measured values of @xmath215 coincide with the theoretical curves for the fluid system , eqs.([sus2ord ] ) and ( [ sus3ord ] ) , almost exactly at low concentration for an accidental correspondence . at higher volume fractions",
    "the ferro - solid displays a susceptibility even below the theoretical prediction .",
    "this effect is more evident for larger @xmath23 at higher @xmath22 .",
    "note , that in ref .",
    "a similar solidified ferro - colloid was investigated .",
    "there @xmath215 was found to increase with @xmath11 , but the values are larger than that for the associated ferrofluid .",
    "again we suspect that this due to finite size effects of their sample .",
    "we point out that the particles in our ferro - solid systems are supposed to be super - paramagnetic .",
    "this means that they have a negligible crystallographic magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "there is no energy barrier which prevents the magnetic dipoles from a free rotation . that makes the present systems different from that one studied in ref . where the initial susceptibility is found to decrease with the increase of the particle concentrations",
    "we have investigated in detail the initial susceptibility , magnetization curve and microstructure of ferrofluids in various particle concentration and dipolar coupling strength ranges by means of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the ferrofluid was modeled as a soft sphere system by means of a purely repulsive lennard - jones potential , and the magnetic cores interacting with a dipolar coupling strength @xmath23 from @xmath174 to @xmath166 .",
    "the investigated volume fractions were in the range of @xmath217 mostly .",
    "our simulation method used the ewald summation with metallic boundary conditions to deal with the long - range dipolar interactions , and took explicitly into account the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the dipolar particles .",
    "the temperature was kept constant by means of a langevin thermostat for all degrees of freedom .",
    "our simulation results for the susceptibility show good agreement with the theoretical predictions in the weak coupling limit @xmath218 . for higher dipolar couplings ,",
    "however , we find systematic deviations from the theoretical predictions at low and intermediate concentrations .",
    "the detailed cluster analysis demonstrates that this is due to the particle aggregation at higher @xmath23 .",
    "the formation of clusters tend to increase the magnetization at weak field regime and consequently induce a larger initial susceptibility . at high densities ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the particles starts to homogenize again , and the significance of clusters goes down .",
    "in fact we speculate that at higher concentrations there are almost no stable clusters any more , because they can disintegrate and reform with other particles rapidly . in this regime",
    "we find that the third order equation in @xmath11 is compatible with our data .",
    "for the magnetization curves we find that both , the second and third order theoretical curves , describe our data well for couplings @xmath146 . for higher values of @xmath23",
    "we find again systematic deviations .",
    "the system shows at coupling strength of @xmath219 an almost gel - like behavior due to entangled chain structures .",
    "we expect this effect to become experimentally relevant in cobalt based ferrofluids , where @xmath23 is large .",
    "the influence of the aggregation phenomena was isolated by studying ferro - solids where the particles are randomly placed inside the simulation volume , and only rotations are allowed to occur .",
    "the observed initial susceptibilities are lower compared to the ferrofluid systems due to the suppression of cluster formation .",
    "the deviations to the fluid system grow with increasing dipolar coupling strength and increasing volume fraction .",
