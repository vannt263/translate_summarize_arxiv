    "dissipation arises in condensed matter systems through a variety of effects .",
    "heating , impurities and currents can often only be included into these open systems via dissipative processes .",
    "these can then contribute to the stabilization or destruction of particular equilibrium phases or produce relevant non ",
    "equilibrium physics such as resistive currents through materials . for many years in the field of ultracold atoms dissipation has been considered as one of the main obstacles in the preparation and manipulation of macroscopic quantum states .",
    "this point of view has changed recently , since it was realized that dissipation enables an additional way of tuning properties of the system .",
    "it has been predicted that the competition of unitary and dissipative dynamics leads to steady  state quantum phases @xcite whose features have been compared to their equilibrium counterparts .",
    "dissipation can be either engineered on purpose @xcite , or be naturally present as , for example , heating processes via two  body loss @xcite , spontaneous decay of rydberg atoms @xcite , or cavity loss @xcite .",
    "another beneficial aspect of controlled dissipation is that it can be exploited as a measurement tool . in this article",
    ", we choose to focus on the realisation of dissipation via an electron beam @xcite although our system can also be realised with an optical quantum gas microscope @xcite .",
    "in all these experiments @xcite , application of a controlled loss process has opened the door to measurement of atoms in an optical lattice with single ",
    "site resolution .",
    "the electron beam experiment @xcite operates in the following way : an electron source is focused into a very tight beam , such that electrons collide with atoms , imparting a very large amount of kinetic energy and expelling them from the trap .",
    "both elastic and inelastic ( i.e. ionizing ) collisions occur and by capturing the ions , the number of atoms in the focus of the beam can be determined .",
    "when applied in the presence of an optical lattice the loss can be made truly localised , i.  e.  acting on a single site , and then the effective loss rate reflects the initial local density per site in the system .",
    "although this measurement procedure is not described by the standard paradigm of projective measurement in quantum mechanics , it has still been shown to exhibit the quantum zeno effect @xcite . in a broader context @xcite",
    ", the quantum zeno effect can be defined as a suppression of the unitary time evolution by an interaction with the external environment . typically , in cold atomic systems",
    "the effect is observed as a non  monotonic behaviour of the effective loss rate in the presence of an external periodic optical potential as a function of the bare loss ( dissipation ) strength : for weak dissipation , the effective loss rate is proportional to the dissipation strength , but in the regime of strong dissipation , the number of expelled particles decays as the dissipation gets stronger .",
    "the basic explanation of this non  intuitive phenomenon lies in the fact that the system protects itself from strong dissipation by approaching very closely a `` dark '' state that is unaffected by a loss process .",
    "the phenomenon has been theoretically addressed @xcite and experimentally observed in three other set  ups in the cold atom context @xcite . in the case of a two  body or three  body loss ,",
    "it was shown that strong dissipation introduces effective hard ",
    "core repulsion into the physical system @xcite precisely via the mentioned quantum zeno effect . in recent experiments on polar molecules in three dimensional optical lattices @xcite the effect has been used to suppress molecular chemical reactions and to measure the density of the system .",
    "previous theoretical investigations of localised single  particle dissipation in bosonic systems have considered few ",
    "site bose ",
    "hubbard systems with large filling fractions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamics induced by local dissipation depends strongly on the initial state : a mean  field gross  pitaevskii  like description works well for initial states that are conventional homogeneous bose - einstein condensates .",
    "on the other hand , a beyond ",
    "mean  field treatment is necessary when the initial state is a bose - einstein condensate with a macroscopic occupation of the single  particle state corresponding to a non  zero momentum vector @xcite . in that case , states with macroscopic entanglement naturally describe the long  time dynamics of the system .",
    "localised dissipation of a one  dimensional strongly correlated system has also been addressed in a dmrg study @xcite , where excitations created by dissipation as well as the quantum zeno effect have been considered in detail .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dynamics induced by localised dissipation for bosons in a two  dimensional lattice at low  filling fractions . to address the problem",
    "we apply the gutzwiller ( gw ) mean  field approximation for the density matrix , which is expected to reasonably capture properties of the system in higher dimensions . in our study",
    "we also include repulsive nearest  neighbour interactions , expected in systems of dipolar or rydberg  dressed quantum gases @xcite and polar molecules @xcite . usually in this context the main features of the quantum zeno effect",
    "are explained by the balance of dissipation and hopping and it is interesting to understand whether and how repulsive nearest  neighbour interactions can affect it . with long  range interactions ,",
    "the model hosts not only mott insulator and superfluid phases , but also density wave and supersolid ground states . in the following",
    "we choose the initial state as the ground state and then compare and contrast the response of superfluid and supersolid phases when exposed to localised dissipation . while the supersolid phase requires strong nearest neighbour repulsion that is still difficult to reach experimentally , it is certainly important to find the fingerprints of weaker repulsive interaction in how a uniform superfluid responds to dissipation .",
    "this paper has the following structure : in sec .",
    "ii we first briefly describe the zero  temperature phase diagram of the extended hubbard model and introduce the quantum master equation that allows us to treat continuous dissipation .",
    "our method of choice for solving the full problem is the gutzwiller mean  field approximation , we discuss its advantages and shortcomings .",
    "however , before solving the full mean  field master equation , we consider in sec .",
    "iii two simpler , but closely related , quench  type processes that introduce local defects into the system . from these",
    "we learn about intrinsic time ",
    "scales and about the dark state of the system .",
    "we then turn to continuous dissipation in sec .",
    "iv and numerically study the response of different phases in the full range of dissipation strengths .",
    "conveniently , our numerical results fit well into the analytical framework of drummond and walls @xcite for a single dissipative cavity , and this enables an analytical insight into our problem . in particular , from the analytical solution we can directly obtain results in the limit of weak and strong dissipation .",
    "furthermore , the analytical formula yields a very reasonable approximation of the numerical data for the whole range of the dissipation strength for the uniform superfluid .",
    "this is an important simplification that will allow for an easy and direct comparison of the theoretical prediction with experimental data , once they are availble .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "we consider a 2d bosonic gas , trapped in a significantly deep optical lattice described by a single  band bose ",

    "the energy functional and time evolution of the gutzwiller ansatz treats the hopping at the mean  field level , while the long  range interaction provides a mean  field correction to the local chemical potential .",
    "explicitly we solve : @xmath13 with the non  linear effective `` hamiltonian '' @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local condensate order parameter .",

    "[ fig : sl1 ] we may conclude that the system recovers from the initial defect on the time scale approximately proportional to the inverse hopping rate . on the contrary ,",
    "the healing time of the typical ss phase is much longer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sl1]b , on the order of @xmath38 .",
    "these time scales will have direct implications on the dynamics in the limit of weak dissipation strength .    in the second protocol",
    "we suddenly remove the four central links of the lattice at the same time as depopulating the central lattice site , fig .",
    "[ fig : sli ] .",
    "the recovery of the system with this type of defect is much more rapid than the sudden depopulation alone that we studied above , as can be seen in fig .",

    ", we show the change in the particle density on the sites next to the decoupled site ( @xmath39 ) as a function of time . as we see , without any nearest neighbour repulsion , sites next to the defect lose some of their initial density , while strong enough nearest neighbour repulsion leads to the opposite effect .",
    "the reason for the quick response is visible in the long  term behaviour : the system approaches the ground state with the four links removed ( which we will refer to as @xmath40 ) . for non ",
    "zero @xmath1 this state exhibits a `` screening '' effect ( see fig  [ fig : sli]c ) .",
    "simply , the density can become much larger at these neighbouring sites , due to the lack of long  range repulsion from the central site and the bulk of the system is only weakly affected by the quench process .",

    "]    we will show in the next section , that the process of removing of the central links is directly related to the limit of strong dissipation .",
    "for this reason it is important to understand in more detail how the saturated values of density and condensate order parameter of these nearest neighbours depend on @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as can be seen in fig  [ fig : sl2]b , in the case of @xmath43 the condensate shows monotonic increase in the order parameter on the neighbouring sites with increasing @xmath6 , but there is only a very weak dependence on @xmath6 throughout the studied range .",
    "more complicated behaviour is found for @xmath28 . for the total initial density fixed at @xmath20 and @xmath6 less than @xmath44 ,",
    "the ground state is a supersolid and we always choose to remove links around the site of higher initial density .",
    "first we notice that saturated values of @xmath45 are always higher than the initial values , see fig  [ fig : sl2]a , a result of the above  mentioned `` screening '' .",
    "now , we compare what happens for @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "initial values of @xmath45 are of the same order , but stronger effective repulsion in the first case yields higher saturated value of @xmath48 . in our simulations , the local condensate fractions @xmath49 of neighbouring sites are very high , i.e. close to 1 , and the change in the density is followed by the related change in @xmath50 .",
    "this explains the decrease of @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath6 observed for weak @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial value of @xmath45 is significantly higher for @xmath53 compared to @xmath54 , corresponding to a smaller density wave order parameter @xmath55 , and this leads also to the higher saturated value .",
    "hence , the decrease in the initial value of the density wave order parameter leads to the increasing saturated values for @xmath56 .",
    "finally , for strong enough @xmath6 , the initial state is a uniform superfluid and exhibits similar qualitative behaviour as found for @xmath9 .",
    "we now introduce dissipation by the use of the master equation . similar to the above scenarios , we choose to affect only the central site of the lattice .",
    "this localised impurity produces several effects : a continuous loss of particles from the system , a disturbance of the bulk and a restructuring of the density profile around the lossy site . in our finite sized systems the disturbance in the bulk will eventually be reflected from the boundary but , as we are interested in the properties of an infinitely large system we only consider time scales smaller than this limit . achieving larger times in our simulation",
    "hence requires larger systems .",
    "although we consider a finite system and the only true `` steady  state '' solution is that of zero particle density , the solutions we obtain can be considered to be quasi ",

    "two examples , with snapshots of their time ",
    "dependent density profiles , are shown in fig .",

    ", we monitor the density of an arbitrary bulk site as a function of time as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : impspeed ] .",
    "we choose a site which is 10 sites away from the center , and observe that it has a nearly constant density for initial times and then exhibits weak oscillations .",
    "the defect propagation velocity is obviously set by @xmath6 , but it seems to be slightly higher in the presence of repulsive @xmath1 .",
    "quantitatively , it is more useful to look at the density on both the lossy site and its neighbours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sflocaldens]a and [ fig : sflocaldens]b .",
    "we see here that these sites very quickly reach their steady  state values within a few hopping time  scales , and that the steady  state particle density on the lossy site itself monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath32 , approaching zero in the large @xmath32 limit .",
    "this means that strong loss prevents hopping to the lossy site and is evidenced in our results in the limit @xmath59 , where we see that the steady  state density of neighbouring sites approaches that of the ground state with central links removed , @xmath40 , as discussed in section  [ sec : no_diss ] . as to be expected , in the opposite limit @xmath60 the saturated value of both lossy site and neighbouring sites are close to their initial values .",

    "the most striking point that we observe here is the behaviour for weak loss . even for loss rates of @xmath64",
    ", we see that the steady  state values are significantly altered compared to the initial values .",
    "this behaviour can be related to the time scales considered in section  [ sec : no_diss ] , where we found that complete recovery of a supersolid state requires many hopping times .",
    "instead , for the shorter time scales considered here , a steady state with different density distribution becomes the relevant one .",
    "for all values of @xmath32 we observe an increase of the density on the neighbouring site .",
    "this behaviour reflects the `` screening '' effect that was found for the ground state with central links removed , @xmath40 , as discussed in section  [ sec : no_diss ] , which we again obtain in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "we must also mention that our results for weak loss may not truly reflect the limit of @xmath60 .",
    "while in the superfluid the relaxation rate at which the density profiles return to equilibrium is related to @xmath6 , yielding the criterion @xmath65 which is satisfied in our simulations , relaxation rates in the supersolid phase are slower and may also depend on higher order processes in perturbation theory ( e.g. @xmath66 ) .",
    "unfortunately the rigorous investigation of even weaker loss rates requires accessing very large simulation times and consequently infeasibly large lattice sizes in order to neglect finite size effects .        within our approach",
    ", the study of local dissipation reduces to a set of coupled single - site hamiltonians . in particular",
    ", the hamiltonian of the central site that is directly exposed to the dissipation has an effective pumping term @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the incoming particles from the neighbouring sites , obtained in the complete gutzwiller simulation . from the numerical data presented in the previous subsection , we find that after an initial transient regime both @xmath39 and @xmath70 reach nearly constant values .",

    "this effect is captured , within the gutzwiller ansatz , by equation ( [ eq : drummond_gammainf ] ) . in the formalism of @xcite , however , the coupling is not the gutzwiller mean  field hopping term but the original full hopping term .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the loss rates beyond mean  field theory would depend also on the particle density of the neighbouring sites , not only on the condensate density , and hence be larger than our results . unfortunately , explicit calculations can not be performed without knowledge of the exact state .",
    "when considering local dissipation as a measurement tool , the main question is which properties of the observed system we can extract from the measured effective loss rates .",
    "the straightforward answer is given by equation ( [ eq : simple_lossrate ] )  effective loss rates are directly related to the density of the lossy site . in the limit of weak dissipation",
    ", this density closely corresponds to the initial bulk density .",
    "however , our results indicate that this limit is not always easy to reach , as for example in the case of the supersolid phase . on the other hand , in the large @xmath32 limit",
    "the effective loss rate is proportional to @xmath98 and related to the corresponding dark state . within our description , further dependence on microscopic parameters of the model is contained in the proportionality constant @xmath100 and in the leading correction term @xmath101 . at approximately half  filling , as considered throughout our paper , the correction term does not play a major role , yet at higher filling fractions it can become more pronounced .",
    "the influence of a similar term has been denoted as the non  linear zeno effect @xcite , since the dissipation rate is reduced by interactions .",
    "we again emphasize that the full interplay of @xmath0 and @xmath32 is captured by equation .",
    "( color online ) loss rates @xmath91 for large dissipation ( @xmath102 ) for varying @xmath6 obtained by numerical calculations within gutzwiller and the analytical result in equation ( [ eq : drummond_gammainf ] ) , which requires the knowledge of the condensate order parameter at the neighbouring sites , taken directly from the numerical calculations of section [ sec : no_diss ] . dashed lines show the @xmath103 dependence , while the vertical line marks the supersolid  superfluid transition . ]",
    "we now turn to further implications of equation ( [ eq : drummond_gammainf ] ) to understand how the effective loss rate in the large @xmath32 limit is modified by the presence of interactions .",
    "the answer is directly based on the results for @xmath96 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl2]b which we now use in combination with equation  ( [ eq : drummond_gammainf ] )",
    "analytical results are in good agreement with full numerical calculations throughout the entire supersolid regime and through the transition to the superfluid phase with and without long  range interaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss_rate_comp_exactphi ] . here",
    "we take a fixed value of @xmath102 and vary @xmath6 to show that the form of equation   fits the numerical data well .",
    "the trend of @xmath103 is clearly visible for @xmath9 through the whole range of @xmath6 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that we are close to half  filling . without long range interactions ,",
    "no quantum phase transition occurs at this filling , hence the condensate fraction is only weakly dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "close to unity filling for example , the condensate fraction would depend more strongly on @xmath6 and affect the @xmath103 behaviour . the @xmath103 dependence is also apparent in the presence of repulsive interactions in the superfluid , where we find that effective loss rates are enhanced by @xmath1 . on the contrary , deep in the supersolid phase the @xmath103 dependence",
    "is strongly suppressed and effective loss rates are much weaker .",
    "( color online ) loss rates @xmath91 for large dissipation ( @xmath102 ) for varying @xmath6 and @xmath1 , obtained by numerical gutzwiller calculations . ]    based on the previous considerations , for a fixed value of @xmath6 and @xmath32 we expect an increase of the effective loss rate with increasing @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss_rate_w ] . however , eventually for strong enough @xmath1 , in our mean  field calculations we reach the supersolid regime that finally leads to a suppression of the dissipative loss .",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the dynamics of the extended bose  hubbard model induced by localised dissipation .",
    "we have solved the master equation using the mean  field gutzwiller approximation and complemented our numerical study by the analytical description of drummond and walls . we have observed a regime of weak dissipation where effective loss rates are almost linearly proportional to the initial density and a regime of strong dissipation which exhibits the quantum zeno effect , where stronger dissipation leads to smaller effective loss rates .",
    "we have demonstrated that at the mean  field level , reasonably accurate loss rates in the quantum zeno regime can be calculated without the need for explicit numerical solutions of the full dissipative problem .",
    "this can be achieved by taking a single result from the simpler non - lossy hermitian calculation ( regarding a quench  type process ) as an input parameter for the analytical theory of drummond and walls @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the case of a superfluid , this approximation turns out to be a very good description of the effective loss rates for the full regime of applied dissipation .    based on these considerations ,",
    "we have then estimated effects of nearest  neighbour repulsive interactions in the regime of strong dissipation : in the superfluid these interactions lead to enhanced effective loss rates due to a mechanism of `` screening '' of the local defect . on the other hand , when nearest neighbour interactions are dominant over the hopping , and induce a supersolid phase , the process of dissipation is strongly suppressed and effective loss rates decrease .",
    "we expect our mean  field results to be even more quantitatively accurate for the three  dimensional optical lattice and uniform superfluid phase . from comparison",
    "to @xcite which introduces an effective model in the limit of strong dissipation , we expect that corrections to the mean  field theory would produce increased loss rates .",
    "finally , we need to mention that time ",
    "dependent non  equilibrium calculations within mean  field theory are more accurate for superfluid rather than supersolid systems , due to the contribution of higher order hopping processes .",
