    "let @xmath2 denote a complete separable metric space , and let @xmath3 denote a borel probability measure on @xmath2 .",
    "one way to measure the interplay between the metric @xmath4 and the measure @xmath3 is by means of an isoperimetric inequality . recall that minkowski s ( exterior ) boundary measure of a borel set @xmath5 , which we denote here by @xmath6 , is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9 extension of @xmath10 with respect to the metric @xmath4 .",

    "an isoperimetric inequality measures the relation between the boundary measure and the measure of a set , by providing a lower bound on @xmath14 by some function @xmath15 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] which is not identically @xmath16 . since @xmath10 and @xmath17 will typically have the same boundary measure , it will be convenient to also define @xmath18 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] as @xmath19 .    another way to measure the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    "is given by concentration inequalities .",
    "the log - concentration profile @xmath20 is defined as the pointwise maximal function @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for all borel sets @xmath5 with @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "concentration inequalities measure how tightly the measure @xmath3 is concentrated around sets having measure @xmath26 as a function of the distance @xmath27 away from these sets , by providing a lower bound on @xmath28 by some non - decreasing function @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 tends to infinity .",
    "the two main differences between isoperimetric and concentration inequalities are that the latter ones only measure the concentration around sets having measure @xmath26 , and do not provide any information for small distances @xmath27 ( smaller than @xmath31 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a wider exposition on these and related topics and for various applications .",
    "it is known and easy to see that an isoperimetric inequality always implies a concentration inequality , simply by `` integrating '' along the isoperimetric differential inequality ( see section [ sec : pre ] ) .",
    "in fact , it will be useful to also consider other _",
    "intermediate _ levels between these two extremes , such as functional inequalities ( e.g. poincar , sobolev and log - sobolev inequalities ) and transport - entropy inequalities ( e.g. talagrand s @xmath32 inequality and its various variants ) . these will be introduced later on , but for now , let us just mention that it is known that these types of inequalities typically follow from appropriate isoperimetric inequalities , and imply appropriate concentration inequalities ( see @xcite or section [ sec : pre ] and the references therein ) .",
    "schematically , this can represented in the following hierarchical diagram : @xmath33    all of the converse statements to the implications above are in general known to be false , due to the possible existence of narrow `` necks '' in the geometry of the space @xmath2 or the measures @xmath3 .",
    "however , when such necks are ruled out by imposing some semi - convexity assumptions on the geometry and measure in the riemannian - manifold - with - density setting ( defined below ) , it was shown in our previous work @xcite that isoperimetric and concentration inequalities are in fact equivalent , with quantitative estimates which _ do not depend _ on the dimension of the underlying manifold ( see section [ sec : pre ] for a precise formulation ) .    the main purpose of this work is to obtain several new applications of this equivalence between isoperimetry and concentration ( and hence of all the intermediate levels as well ) , which seem to have been previously inaccessible .",
    "we will henceforth assume that @xmath34 is a smooth complete oriented connected @xmath35-dimensional ( @xmath36 ) riemannian manifold @xmath37 , that @xmath4 is the induced geodesic distance , and that @xmath3 is an absolutely continuous measure with respect to the riemannian volume form @xmath38 on @xmath39 .",
    "[ def : ca ] we will say that our _ smooth @xmath40-semi - convexity assumptions _ are satisfied @xmath41 if @xmath3 is supported on a geodesically convex set @xmath42 , on which @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and as tensor fields on @xmath45 : @xmath46 we will say that our _ @xmath40-semi - convexity assumptions _ are satisfied if @xmath3 can be approximated in total - variation by measures @xmath47 so that each @xmath48 satisfies our smooth @xmath40-semi - convexity assumptions .",
    "+ when @xmath49 , we will say in either case that our _ ( smooth ) convexity assumptions _ are satisfied .",
    "here @xmath50 denotes the ricci curvature tensor of @xmath37 and @xmath51 denotes the second covariant derivative .",
    "@xmath52 is the well - known bakry  mery curvature tensor , introduced in @xcite ( in the more abstract framework of diffusion generators ) , which incorporates the curvature from both the geometry of @xmath37 and the measure @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath53 is sufficiently smooth and @xmath54 , our @xmath40-semi - convexity assumption is then precisely the curvature - dimension condition @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an important example to keep in mind is that of euclidean space @xmath56 equipped with a probability measure @xmath57 with @xmath58",
    ".      one central theme in this work will be in deducing new stability results of isoperimetric and functional inequalities with respect to perturbations of the measure @xmath3 , in the presence of our semi - convexity assumptions . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath59 are two probability measures on @xmath37 such that @xmath60 is close to @xmath61 with respect to some ( not necessarily symmetric ) distance , we will show that under appropriate semi - convexity assumptions , @xmath62 inherits from @xmath63 a quantitatively comparable isoperimetric or functional inequality .",
    "a - priori , it seems very difficult to analyze the stability of these questions directly ( at least for non - trivial distances ) , possibly due to the fact that in general no stability is possible and that some further weak convexity conditions need to be imposed .",
    "our approach for obtaining stability results in such cases , is to decouple the stability question from the convexity assumptions .",
    "we first pass from the isoperimetric or functional inequality to an appropriate concentration inequality ( this is always possible without any further assumptions ) ; the stability question on the level of concentration turns out to be elementary , and it is easy to obtain a concentration inequality for the perturbed measure ; lastly , we utilize our semi - convexity assumptions and pass back to the isoperimetric or functional level , by employing the equivalence between concentration and isoperimetry .",
    "our results apply to several different notions of distance between @xmath61 ( the original measure ) and @xmath60 ( the perturbed measure ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath64 - we show in section [ sec : stab1 ] that when @xmath60 satisfies our semi - convexity assumptions , and @xmath61 satisfies a strong enough isoperimetric or functional inequality , the latter property is inherited by @xmath60 .",
    "we formulate some results specifically for the log - sobolev inequality , since it lies precisely on the border of our method , and since it is very useful in applications .",
    "our results extend beyond the classical stability result for the log - sobolev inequality of holley and stroock @xcite ; in addition , under our convexity assumptions , we improve the classical quantitative dependence on @xmath65 from linear to logarithmic .",
    "@xmath66 - we introduce a new metric @xmath67 between exponentially integrable probability measures , which we call the @xmath68-lipschitz metric .",
    "we show in section [ sec : stab2 ] analogous stability results for this distance as for the first one , when @xmath60 satisfies our semi - convexity assumptions .",
    "the main advantage of using this distance over the first one is that this result may be applicable even when the measures @xmath59 are mutually singular .",
    "@xmath69 - using the usual @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath70 , we show in section [ sec : stab2 ] that under our convexity assumptions ( @xmath71 case ) , linear ( cheeger type ) isoperimetric inequalities or poincar inequalities are easily inherited .",
    "this also applies when having control over the relative entropies : @xmath72 or @xmath73 .    the importance of obtaining dimension - free log - sobolev and poincar inequalities in the context of statistical mechanics has been clarified in the works of stroock ",
    "zegarlinski @xcite , yoshida @xcite and bodineau  helffer @xcite , who showed ( roughly speaking ) that these are equivalent to the decay of spin - spin correlations ( implying in particular the uniqueness of the corresponding gibbs measure in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "the stability results described above are therefore relevant in understanding the effects of perturbing the hamiltonian potential in this context .",
    "another application pertains to transport - entropy inequalities , first introduced by marton @xcite and developed by talagrand @xcite ( see section [ sec : pre ] ) . in general ,",
    "given two convex functions @xmath74 , one may define a @xmath75 transport - entropy inequality as the following statement : @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the cost - function @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the wasserstein distance with cost - function @xmath80 , and @xmath81 denotes the relative entropy ( see section [ sec : pre ] for definitions ) . by jensen s inequality ,",
    "it is immediate that @xmath82 implies the following ( in general , strictly ) weaker statement : @xmath83 it was shown by bobkov and gtze @xcite that the latter inequality is in fact equivalent to a variant of a concentration inequality .",
    "we clarify this equivalence in proposition [ prop : con - te ] , which seems new and may be of independent interest , removing the inherent dimension dependence in previous results by djellout  guillin ",
    "wu @xcite , bolley  villani @xcite , and gozlan ",
    "leonard @xcite . using this characterization ,",
    "we show that under our semi - convexity assumptions , it is possible in many cases to obtain a converse to jensen s inequality , up to dimension - independent constants , passing back from ( [ eq : intro - te - weak ] ) to ( [ eq : intro - te ] )",
    ".      it would be very hard to describe our results in more detail in any reasonably sized introduction , without first defining many necessary notions .",
    "these are given in section [ sec : pre ] , which serves as an extended introduction to this work .",
    "we describe the hierarchy ( [ eq : intro - hierarchy ] ) in detail , and formulate our main result from @xcite , asserting the equivalence of concentration and isoperimetric inequalities under the semi - convexity assumptions , which permits reversing the hierarchy and completing the equivalence .",
    "the stability results with respect to perturbation of the measure are given in sections [ sec : stab1 ] ( for the distance @xmath84 ) and [ sec : stab2 ] ( for the @xmath68-lipschitz , wasserstein and relative entropy distances ) . in section",
    "[ sec : inter ] , we set the ground for properly relating between transport - entropy and concentration inequalities ; parts of it may be of independent interest . in section [ sec : te - equiv ] , we briefly state the results on the equivalence of transport - entropy inequalities with different cost - functions .    * acknowledgments .",

    "the control on the perturbation was measured in terms of control over some notion of distance between the original measure @xmath61 and the perturbed measure @xmath60 .",
    "three distances were analyzed : @xmath462 , @xmath463 and the total variation distance @xmath464 .",
    "although some essentially sharp estimates were obtained in @xcite , there is a certain drawback in using any of the above distances , which was already mentioned in the beginning of this section .    in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the stability with respect to two new distances : the wasserstein distance @xmath429 and the relative entropies @xmath430 and @xmath431 , which provide further flexibility over the previous distances .",
    "the idea is based on the following elementary :    [ lem : w1-fm ] let @xmath61,@xmath60 denote two probability measures on a common metric space @xmath2 .",
    "then : @xmath465    let @xmath466 denote a @xmath1-lipschitz function . then : @xmath467 where we have used the dual characterization ( [ eq : mkr - duality ] ) of @xmath70 in the last inequality .",
    "taking supremum on @xmath93 as above , and exchanging the roles of @xmath61 and @xmath60 , the assertion immediately follows .",
    "using theorem [ thm : main - roc ] ( and remark [ rem : main - roc - trivial ] ) , we immediately deduce the following stability result with respect to the @xmath1-wasserstein distance :    [ thm : w1-stability ] if @xmath445 satisfies our convexity assumptions then : @xmath468 where @xmath469 are some numeric constants .    exchanging the roles of @xmath61 and @xmath60 ,",
    "we conclude :    if @xmath443 and @xmath445 satisfy our convexity assumptions and @xmath470 , then @xmath471 , where the constants implied by @xmath472 depend linearly on @xmath473 .    in practice ,",
    "it is convenient to estimate @xmath429 by using the relative entropies @xmath431 or @xmath430 .",
    "these two possibilities turn out to be rather different .    by corollary [ cor :",

    "moreover , for any @xmath189 : @xmath478    a different estimate is obtained from lemma [ lem : w1-fm ] and theorem [ thm : main - roc ] by proceeding as above but reversing the roles of @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "this time , we can not use the weak @xmath479 transport - entropy inequality given by ( [ eq : wtc - p ] ) as in the proof of theorem [ thm : going - down - h ] ( the reader may want to check this ) , so we employ its tight equivalent form given by proposition [ prop : con - te ] : @xmath480 where , recall , @xmath481 is given by ( [ eq : def - varphi ] ) .",
    "[ thm : going - up - h ] there exists a universal constant @xmath201 so that if @xmath482 and @xmath445 satisfies our convexity assumptions , then : @xmath483 where @xmath484 are some other universal constants .",
    "the first and last inequalities follow from theorem [ thm : main - roc ] and remark [ rem : main - roc - trivial ] .",
    "to deduce the middle inequality , we use lemma [ lem : w1-fm ] and ( [ eq : tc - ql ] ) : @xmath485 multiplying by @xmath486 and using theorem [ thm : main - roc ] , we conclude that : @xmath487 for some universal constant @xmath488 .",
    "the assertion now clearly follows .    a corollary which summarizes the resulting stability is :    if @xmath443 and @xmath445 satisfy our convexity assumptions then : @xmath489 where @xmath490 are numeric constants .",
    "in particular :    * if @xmath491 then @xmath492 . * if @xmath493 then @xmath494 .    note that when @xmath495 , the results of theorems [ thm : going - down - h ] and [ thm : going - up - h ] may be recovered from our previous results from @xcite , where the total - variation distance @xmath496 was employed .",
    "this follows from the well - known pinsker - csizsar - kullback inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) : @xmath497 analogous stability results to those in this subsection were shown in @xcite when @xmath498 , for @xmath499 .",

    "all the results in this subsection regarding @xmath502 also apply to the poincar constant @xmath503 , since these two are equivalent under our convexity assumptions ( see theorem [ thm : main - roc ] or subsection [ subsec : pre - reverse ] ) .",
