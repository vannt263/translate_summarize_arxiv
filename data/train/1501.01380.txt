    "with the recent discovery of the higgs boson by the lhc @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) has reaffirmed itself as the theoretical explanation of elementary particle dynamics , including presenting a plausible picture of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) @xcite through the higgs mechanism .",
    "while this is so , and not withstanding the fact that sm has been extensively tested very successfully by many different experiments @xcite , it is widely believed that the sm is an effective theory , which needs to incorporate suitable modifications at large energies .",
    "many expect that this large energy scale could be as small as a few tev , which is being explored at the lhc .",
    "apart from direct measurements of the properties of the higgs boson , like its interaction couplings with itself , as well as with gauge bosons and fermions , signature of ewsb could be probed by understanding the structure and values of gauge - boson self interactions .",
    "this is so , because the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the gauge bosons arise from the higgs sector .",
    "the relation between the higgs - gauge boson couplings and the trilinear gauge couplings are presented and studied in ref .",
    "the discovery of higgs boson of about @xmath10 gev mass , while establishing the higgs mechanism as the method of ewsb , has opened an era of higgs precision studies .",
    "being a hadronic machine lhc has limitations to undertake precision studies .",
    "the international linear collider ( ilc ) proposed to collide high energy , high luminosity electrons and positrons has the mission of studying the sm at high precision and to look for signals beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "such a machine is well suited to an in - depth analysis of the gauge boson interactions within and beyond the sm .",
    "a large number of physics studies establish the fact that the potential of ilc is further enhanced by considering high energy photon - photon ( @xmath11 ) collisions as well as electron - photon ( @xmath12 ) collisions , apart from the electron - positron ( @xmath13 ) collisions .",
    "it is obvious that , the @xmath12 and @xmath14 colliders are better suited to study the photon couplings with other gauge bosons like the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . in this article",
    "we will focus on @xmath1 with @xmath19 .",
    "signature of such an event is a single lepton with large missing energy .",
    "this process is sensitive to new physics effects including anomalous @xmath15 @xcite , composite fermion models @xcite , etc . in the case of anomalous @xmath15 couplings ,",
    "this process has the advantage over @xmath20 @xcite , which is sensitive to both @xmath15 and @xmath21 couplings .",
    "again , @xmath22 @xcite is sensitive to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 couplings , revealing the edge of @xmath12 collider to study @xmath15 . in most of the previous studies , observables at the production level of the single @xmath23",
    "is investigated , with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors consider angular spectrum of the secondary leptons , also including the effect of off - shell @xmath23 .",
    "our main aim of this work is to study the possibility to exploit the secondary lepton spectrum including the energy and angular distributions to probe relevant new physics signals arising in anomalous @xmath15 coupling .    in many models beyond the sm the quartic and triple - gauge boson couplings including @xmath15are altered from their sm values . in a model independent approach , an effective lagrangian with terms additional to the sm lagrangian",
    "is considered in phenomenological and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "relevant to the process considered here , the effective @xmath15 vertex is commonly parametrized in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath6 , in the absence of cp violation ( with vanishing sm values ) .",
    "lep constraints in single - parameter analysis ( taking one parameter at a time , keeping the others at their sm values ) gives bounds of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and two - parameter analysis limits their values to @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite at 95% c.l .",
    "tevatron constraints from @xmath30 process are not contaminated by other couplings , but are more relaxed compared the lep constraints to give @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the cms constraints @xcite from @xmath30 process are also more relaxed compared the lep constraints .",
    "phenomenology of anomalous @xmath15 coupling in the context of lhc as well as ilc has been carried out in a number of recent publications @xcite . in particular , @xcite has analyzed single @xmath23 production with its leptonic decay to probe the effect of anomalous couplings in @xmath12 collision . in this work",
    "we exploit the full potential of the secondary lepton spectrum to study the effect of @xmath15 coupling in @xmath33 .    in the next section",
    "we provide some details of the process and the observables used . in section 3 we present our numerical results , and finally summarize the study and present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "considering a real on - shell photon , the most general cp - conserving @xmath15 coupling within a lorentz invariant lagrangian can be written in the following form @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 \\label{eqn : leff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the sm , the gauge structure @xmath35 dictates the @xmath15 couplings , with vanishing @xmath2 and @xmath6 at tree level .",
    "therefore , precise measurements of these couplings will test the gauge sector of the electroweak interactions . fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn ] shows the feynman diagrams for the process along with the momentum labels .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "with the @xmath23 decaying into muons , tthe single @xmath23 production in @xmath12 collisions has a spectacular final state of one single muon , and missing energy .",
    "the process is well suited to study the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "it may be noted that the process has the advantage that , unlike other relevant process like the @xmath23 pair production at @xmath13 collisions , it is devoid of effects from other anomalous couplings like @xmath21 . considering this process , angular distribution of secondary muons in the lab frame",
    "is easily constructed , and is readily available in the literature . at the same time , such is not the case of its energy distribution .",
    "here we have presented a semi - analytical way to explore the secondary lepton energy - angle distributions in @xmath1 with @xmath36 .",
    "the advantage of such an observable in analyzing the sm case and probing possible new physics effects is demonstrated .",
    "variables being defined in the lab frame , are directly used to probe different kinematic regions , so as to explore the sensitivity of the anomalous couplings .",
    "we have derived possible limits on the anomalous couplings @xmath2 and @xmath6 , which may be obtained from the cross - section measurements .",
    "it is shown that , assuming the other couplings is absent , @xmath37 level of cross - section can probe @xmath2 to the level of @xmath3 , and constrain @xmath6 to @xmath38 , for a moderate luminosity of 100 fb@xmath4 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath5 gev .",
    "the large influence of each of these couplings on the sensitivity of the other is quite visible in the derivable limits .",
    "scanning the two parameter plane the @xmath37 bound is presented , showing that @xmath2 could be bounded to small regions for particular values of @xmath6 .",
    "the angular distributions along with forward - backward asymmetry improve the situation with better sensitivity . with the large cross - section ,",
    "the statistics is very good even for 100 fb@xmath4 integrated luminosity , which could measure the forward - backward asymmetry to a few percent level .",
    "it is found that this could be utilized to improve the limits on @xmath6 , whereas not so in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "exploring different kinematic regions , and studying suitably constructed observables would be able to distinguish different scenarios involving the couplings .",
    "we studied the energy and angle distributions of the @xmath39 separately and together to understand how these could be fruitfully employed for this purpose .",
    "the energy - angle double distribution enables one to identify the kinematic regions sensitive to different couplings , and their signs .",
    "we have found that focusing on the low energy @xmath39 in the backward direction are more sensitive to the case of @xmath8 , whereas the @xmath2 does not show distinguishable preference to the kinematic regions .",
    "our analysis shows that the case of ( i ) @xmath40 , or non - zero and positive , ( ii ) non - zero and negative can be distinguished this way , as explained in table  [ table : energy ] . on the other hand",
    ", the sign of @xmath2 can be distinguished in the absence of @xmath6 , whereas it is hard to do this if @xmath6 is non - zero . at @xmath41 gev , with 100 fb@xmath4 luminosity ,",
    "the bound on the @xmath6 , when it is negative could be improved by about a factor of 2 by considering the forward - backward asymmetry at a fixed energy ( @xmath42 ) , compared to the case when the energy is integrated out .",
    "we are aware that the present considerations of the ilc do not favour a photon collider option as priority . at the same time , we hope that this study will help the case for this option at ilc , and expect it to be available eventually . meanwhile ,",
    "although more accurate estimates incorporating collider and detector effects , and beam polarization effects are needed to make more quantitative conclusions , we hope our analyses has shown that the leptonic decay of the @xmath23 produced in @xmath12 collision is one of the neat and simple process to probe the @xmath0 coupling without the complications of other couplings .",
    "further , the process has the potential to probe the couplings to a few per - mil level with suitably constructed observables , which could also be used to distinguish different scenarios involving the two parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "* appendix : photon luminosity distribution * + the colliding photons in a realistic electron - photon collider does not have a fixed energy , rather the beam will have distribution of photons with energy varying over an allowed range ( which depends on the initial electron and laser photon energies among other things ) . in such colliders ,",
    "the cross - section and other observables should , therefore , be properly folded with a luminosity distribution function to get the measurable quantities , as is done in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lumfold ] .    at ilc high energy , high luminosity photon beam",
    "is obtained by compton backscattering of low energy , high intensity laser beam off high energy electron beam .",
    "ideal compton backscattered photon spectrum is given by @xcite    @xmath43 \\nonumber\\\\             d(\\xi)&=&\\left(1-\\frac{4}{\\xi}-\\frac{8}{\\xi^2}\\right)~\\ln\\left(1+\\xi\\right )             + \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{8}{\\xi}-\\frac{1}{2(1+\\xi)^2 } , \\label{eqn : lumspec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the energy of the initial electron and @xmath46 the energy of the scattered photon .",
    "@xmath47 thus gives the fraction of the electron energy carried by the scattered photon .",
    "dependence of the distributions on the initial laser photon energy ( @xmath48 ) comes through @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the electron mass .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath47 is @xmath51 .",
    "it is , but not possible to increase @xmath48 and @xmath52 to any value to get larger @xmath53 .",
    "it is found that for @xmath54 beyond @xmath55 , conversion efficiency drops down drastically due to @xmath13 pair production between the laser photons and the backscattered photons , setting an absolute upper limit on @xmath56 .",
    "this value essentially means that with an electron beam of energy @xmath57 gev , we can effectively go up to @xmath58 ev .      in a realistic collider ,",
    "one need to also worry about many detailed aspects , like the non - linear effects making the actual photon spectrum deviating from the ideal case in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lumspec ] , the polarization of the hard photon .",
    "the polarization ( @xmath60 ) of the scattered photon itself depend on the initial electron ( @xmath61 ) and the laser beam polarization ( @xmath62 ) . in the high energy region , it is noted that @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this could be used to the advantage of the physics studies being considered . in our analysis",
    ", we have not gone into these details . we have assumed unpolarized initial electron and laser beams , which produces an unpolarized high energy photon beam ( to a very good approximation ) .",
