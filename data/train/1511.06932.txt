    ", our work is motivated by studying first passage percolation on random media with heavy correlation .",
    "the main contribution of our work , is to demonstrate an instance that in a hierarchical random field the exponent of the fpp distance can be strictly less than 1 ( despite the fact that the a straight line has weight with exponent strictly larger than 1 , and that the majority of the vertices are of values @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is , of course , rather different from the classical fpp where the edge / vertex weights are independent and identically distributed .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a review of classical first passage percolation .",
    "in the specific instance of branching random walk , our work is closely related to the first passage percolation problem when the vertex weight is given by exponentiating a two - dimensional discrete gaussian free field ( gff ) .",
    "inspired by the current work , a similar upper bound on the fpp distance in this case has been recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "the fpp on two - dimensional discrete gff , as we expect , is of fundamental importance in understanding the random metric associated with the liouville quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite .",
    "we remark that the random metric of lqg is a major open problem , even `` just '' to make rigorous sense of it . in a recent series of works of miller and sheffield ,",
    "much understanding has been obtained ( more on the continuum set up ) in the special case of @xmath31 ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another recent work @xcite has provided some bounds on the scaling exponent for a type of lqg metric , though we emphasize that their definition is of very different flavor from the fpp perspective considered in our paper ( in particular , no mathematical connection can be drawn between these works at the moment ) . we refrain ourselves from an extensive discussion on background of lqg in this article . as a final remark to the connection of lqg metric",
    ", we note that there are other candidate discrete metric ( associated with lqg or gff ) that have been proposed , and it is possible that these metrics with suitable normalization would give a more desirable scaling limit than that of fpp .",
    "however , we feel that in the level of precision of the present article and that of @xcite , it is quite possible that the fundamental mathematical structures ( and thus obstacles ) are common for these related notions of metrics .",
    "brw is perhaps the simplest construction that approximates a log - correlated gaussian field , of which the gff is a special instance .",
    "a number of other properties , especially those regarding to the extreme values of the field , have been proved to exhibit universal behavior among log - correlated gaussian fields ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is typical that properties were first proved for brw , and then later for gff ; and it is also typical that the proof in the case of gff were substantially enlightened by the understanding on brw .",
    "however , caution is required when drawing heuristic conclusion on gff based on brw for fpp : as demonstrated in @xcite , there exists a family of log - correlated gaussian fields whose exponent for fpp can be made arbitrarily close to 1 ( as @xmath32 grows to @xmath33 ) if one is allowed to perturb the covariance entry - wise by an additive amount that is at most @xmath32 ( and thus the scaling exponent for fpp is non - universal among log - correlated fields ) .",
    "that being said , we remark that while the mathematical details in @xcite are substantially more involved and delicate , these two papers do share the same very basic multi - scale analysis proof framework .",
    "our approach is inspired by the rescaling argument employed in the proof of the connectivity of fractal percolation process @xcite , the idea of which went back to @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of induction , we will in fact work with crossings through a rectangle rather than a square . in",
    "what follows , we should consider @xmath34 as a small positive number ( but fixed as @xmath35 ) .",
    "we wish to carry out a inductive construction and proof for light path crossing the rectangle : we will take advantage of the hierarchical structure of brw and will construct the brw along the way as we construct light path in different scales . in order to properly describe our procedure ,",
    "we need a number of definitions .",
    "let @xmath36 $ ] be an odd , positive integer for some @xmath37 to be selected , and let @xmath38 \\times [ 0 , n - 1 ] )   \\cap { \\mathbb{z}}^2 $ ] .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath39 odd is mere technical convenience which will become apparent later .",
    "we will also work under the assumption that @xmath40 ( small or large enough for our bounds or inequalities to hold although we keep this implicit in our discussions ) .",
    "we define a gaussian process @xmath41 on @xmath42 as follows :    * @xmath43 is a brw on @xmath44 \\times [ 0 , n-1 ] ) \\cap { \\mathbb{z}}^2 $ ] where @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "* @xmath43 s are independent of each other for @xmath46 $ ] .",

    "we can view @xmath47 as a @xmath48 rectangle divided into @xmath39 cells of dimension @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , @xmath50 can be viewed as a @xmath51 rectangle divided into 4 sub - rectangles of dimension @xmath52 each of which is a copy of @xmath47 ( see figure  [ fig : geodesic_new ] below for an illustration ) .",

    "as the path crosses through the rectangle of @xmath69 , we will make a choice of whether the path will stay in the upper or lower sub - rectangles based on the gaussian values associated with the boxes of dimension @xmath71 , and thus we will switch back and forth between top and bottom layers .",
    "our goal is to show that the expected weight of the crossing we constructed expands by a factor less than 2 when the size of the rectangles doubles .",
    "apart from doubling of dimension at each level , there are a number of reasons that the weight will expand : ( 1 ) for standard gaussian variable , we have @xmath72 ; ( 2 ) we will need to make a construction to connect the paths on the left half and the right half of the rectangle ; ( 3 ) every time we switch between top and bottom layer , we will have to add a top - down crossing in the switching location .",
    "what we would possibly gain is from the `` variation '' of these gaussian variables associated with @xmath71 boxes , and thus choosing the favorable layer would reduce the weight of our path .",
    "there are a couple of subtle points in carrying out this plan , as we explain now .    in order to see how switching will reduce our cost ,",
    "we first consider a toy problem where we simply compute @xmath73 for independent standard gaussian variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it turns out for this purpose it is more convenient to write @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and thus @xmath78 .",
    "if we carry out inductive procedure in this fashion , what we gain from the switching will not be able to beat the aforementioned expansions .",
    "this is because , in the language of the toy model , @xmath79 is itself a random variable that can be written as @xmath80 , where we gain @xmath81 by averaging over @xmath82 but we get nothing by averaging over @xmath83 ( which is independent of @xmath82 ) .",
    "in fact , the better strategy would be to save the variation from @xmath84 and use it in the optimizations in the next scale .",
    "but it is inconvenient to carry out this strategy , as it would require to do an induction based on quantities beyond the expected weight of the crossings in different scales .",
    "we resolve this issue by represent the brw in a different way , which is tailored for our application here .",
    "another point is that , in the aforementioned optimization procedure , one has to be rather strategic in switchings as there is a cost for that .",
