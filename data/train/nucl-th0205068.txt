    "several techniques for an exact treatment of the problem of generating the full many - body physical state space for simple nuclear models can be found in the literature .",

    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and our work present some analogies , which will be discussed here and in the following sections .",
    "the combinatorial method used in the present work is based on the gaussian polynomial expansion of a generating function of states of @xmath63 identical particles coupled to a given angular momentum , @xmath64 .",

    "the generating function approach is extended to the full racah decomposition @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the seniority group ( orthogonal for bosons and symplectic for fermions ) , on the basis of a simple consideration : if a state of an @xmath63-particle configuration of given angular momentum contains at least one zero - coupled pair , then the state appears also in the @xmath86-particle configuration , because the zero - coupled pair does not contribute to the angular momentum . as a consequence ,",

    "@xmath90 in the fermion case , because of pauli blocking .",

    "unpaired particle configurations ( input for the distribution generator ) ; 3 .",
    "number of unpaired protons ( neutrons ) ; 4 .",
    "total number of broken pairs .",
    "the energy corresponding to each many - body configuration is calculated by using the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : epair ] ) for the pairing contribution .",
    "as it is well known , the basic problem in the generation of multi - particle configurations is that only a small fraction of the lexicographically generated levels is found below the chosen excitation energy cut - off .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithm for generating the multi - particle configurations is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is important to emphasize that the algorithm generates all possible states , i.e. not even a single state is lost up to the excitation energy cut - off .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb208-saddle ] , where we compare the total state density of @xmath2pb up to 50 mev calculated by the spindis algorithm with the one calculated by the saddle - point approximation to the inverse laplace transform of a grand - canonical fermion partition function .",
    "the latter approach to non - collective state density has been used for years , and is known to be very reliable , provided the excitation energy is not too low . above the neutron binding energy , the numerical results are in very good agreement , so that the two methods are mutually corroborated .",
    "the input parameters of the calculation will be discussed in section [ sec : num - res ] .",
    "we note that at the excitation energy of @xmath99 mev the state density @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to the total state density @xmath101 , spindis computes the density of states of given spin projection @xmath102 , and the density of levels of given spin @xmath103",
    "@xmath104    what is the maximum excitation energy at which calculations can be performed in our model ?",
    "the single - nucleon wave functions are expanded in a spherical harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "this means that if too many oscillator shells were included in the calculation , the resulting nuclear state densities would steadily increase with energy .",
    "nuclei have finite binding energies and state densities are expected to reach a maximum well below the dissociation region , and to decrease at higher excitation energies up to the dissociation point .",
    "therefore , we can either truncate the sequence of single - particle levels in such a way that yields a realistic behavior of total state densities when the excitation energy approaches the dissociation point , or we can limit our calculations to excitation energies that are well below the expected maximum , so that the resulting state densities are not very sensitive to the maximum number of single - particle orbitals included in the calculations .    in the present work we have chosen the simpler alternative .",
    "the calculations extend up to @xmath105 mev , which is of the order of magnitude of the nuclear potential well , and therefore of the maximum allowed one - hole energy .",
    "this excitation energy is much lower than @xmath106 mev , ( @xmath10 is the mass number ) at which the physical state density already shows significant deviations from a simple bethe formula like behavior . at even higher energies , the state density can be approximated by a gaussian curve decreasing to 0 around @xmath107 mev  @xcite .",
    "an application of the state density formalisms to heavy ion reactions , where excitation energies between @xmath108 and @xmath109 mev are easily attained , necessitates a physically sound prescription for the truncation of the single - particle level scheme .",
    "one possibility , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where use is made of the recursive algorithms of ref .",
    "@xcite , is to include , in addition to bound states , only those neutron quasi - bound states that are below the centripetal barrier and the proton quasi - bound states that are below the coulomb plus centripetal barrier or , alternatively , quasi - bound states that have optical - model transmission coefficients less than 0.05 . a main default of the same work , however , is the use of a static mean field approximation , hardly justifiable at excitation energies above the pion production threshold , with the net result of overestimating the total state density at high excitation energy .",
    "the extension of the present formalism to the energy region of interest in heavy ion reactions will be investigated in a future work .",
    "until now we have explicitly considered only non - collective degrees of freedom in generating nuclear states at high excitation energy . the effective particle - vibration coupling that leads to realistic single - particle spectra around the fermi energy",
    "is treated phenomenologically by an energy dependence of the effective single - nucleon potential and , therefore , of the effective nucleon mass .",
    "it is well known , however , that collective nuclear excitations give a sizable contribution to the total state density at low excitation energy , and therefore must be included in the model space in order to have a meaningful comparison with experimental data . since the present analysis is limited to spherical nuclei , the collective enhancement of the total state density will be mainly due to surface vibrations of various multipolarities .",
    "the lowest - lying vibrational modes are the quadrupole , with spin - parity @xmath110 and energy @xmath111 mev , and the octupole , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 mev .",
    "the effect of collective degrees of freedom on total state densities is conveniently illustrated by assuming the adiabatic decoupling of collective and non - collective excitations , approximately valid at excitation energies @xmath34 much higher than the average , or characteristic , collective energy @xmath114 .",
    "this assumption is generally not valid in the energy range of interest to the present work , and is made here only for the sake of simplicity .",

    "for any given eigenvalue @xmath116 , the effective excitation energy available to non - collective modes , is @xmath117 , and the total state density is obtained by summing the combinatorial state densities corresponding to all effective excitation energies @xmath118 \\ , , \\label{sd - tot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided that @xmath119 .",
    "let us introduce the temperature @xmath120 corresponding to the excitation energy @xmath34 , according to the definition @xmath121 eq .",
    "( [ sd - tot ] ) can thus be rewritten in the form @xmath122 the enhancement factor is the collective partition function @xmath123 at temperature @xmath124 .",
    "we emphasize that the above derivation is not based on the assumption that the fermion system is in equilibrium with an external heat and particle bath , as required by a grand - canonical ensemble description . on the contrary ,",
    "our fermion system is isolated , since the non - collective state density @xmath125 is calculated by a combinatorial method consistent with a micro - canonical ensemble description , and the definition ( [ t_mc ] ) of temperature is based on boltzmann s definition of entropy , @xmath126 , valid in the micro - canonical ensemble .    as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above micro - canonical description can be transformed into a grand - canonical one by observing that @xmath127 , where @xmath128 goes to zero for @xmath129 .",
    "thus , @xmath130 as a consequence we expect that , as soon as the excitation energy is high enough for a grand - canonical description to become applicable , the fermion system can be considered in thermal equilibrium with an external reservoir at a temperature @xmath131 , systematically lower than the micro - canonical temperature @xmath120 , derived from the combinatorial state density @xmath125 , at the same energy @xmath34 .",
    "this is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : pb208 t ] , which compares the grand - canonical and micro - canonical temperatures of @xmath2pb as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the micro - canonical temperature has been obtained by numerical derivation of an energy - smoothed state density , in order to avoid numerical divergence at energies where the original combinatorial state density displays discontinuities connected with the opening of particle - hole excitation channels .",
    "more precisely , formula ( [ t_mc ] ) predicts divergence of inverse temperature , and , consequently , a sudden temperature dip at any discontinuity connected with a new particle - hole excitation , followed by a zero inverse temperature , and then a diverging temperature , in the plateau between two successive discontinuities of the state density .",
    "the rapid oscillations of the micro - canonical temperature derived from a state density computed in energy bins , @xmath35 , as small as 500 kev , are progressively washed out with increasing @xmath35 up to 2 mev , where good agreement is reached with the grand - canonical temperature corresponding to the same excitation energy .",
    "a non monotonic behaviour of temperature as a function of excitation energy was experimentally observed for the first time in the level densities of well deformed lanthanides below 6 mev  @xcite and , more recently , also in the level densities of weakly deformed sm isotopes  @xcite and attributed to progressive breaking of nucleon pairs , and , at higher energies , quenching of pair correlations .",
    "although this effect has not been observed till now in magic nuclei , where the discontinuities in level densities should be connected with non - collective particle - hole excitations across shell closures , a proper extension of the micro - canonical formalism to open - shell nuclei would make it possible to compare calculated temperature fluctuations with those extracted from experimental data , thus giving an important advantage at low excitation energies over a canonical formalism , where temperature fluctuations are smoothed out by construction .    if the derivative in eq .",

    "a temperature - dependent rotational enhancement of standard form is taken into account in the level densities of strongly deformed nuclei .",
    "although the calculation does not include any explicit vibrational enhancement for spherical nuclei , this effect is implicitly taken into account by adjusting excitation energy and entropy so as to reproduce empirical data , such as the cumulative numbers of discrete levels and the neutron resonance spacings .",
    "this study , however , is neither limited to the about 300 nuclei whose neutron resonance spacings are measured , nor to the about 1200 nuclei whose discrete spectra are known to some extent , but , aiming at astrophysical applications , is extended to 8000 nuclei outside the beta - stability valley , where extrapolation of empirical systematics would not make any sense .",
    "total and spin - dependent level densities are provided in tabular form up to an excitation energy of 150 mev .",
    "a new promising approach to nuclear level densities in the canonical framework is provided by the shell - model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite . there , use is made of the hubbard - stratonovich representation for the @xmath152 operator , @xmath153 being the inverse temperature , and the energy of the system , @xmath34 , is computed by the auxiliary field method as a function of @xmath153 from the canonical expectation value of the hamiltonian through an exact particle - number projection of both protons and neutrons .",
    "the partition function , @xmath154 , is then determined by numerical integration of @xmath155 and the level density obtained as the inverse laplace transform of @xmath156 , in the saddle - point approximation . using in their hamiltonian a separable surface - peaked residual interaction , in addition to the standard pairing interaction , active in the @xmath157 valence shell , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to reproduce the experimental level density of @xmath158fe up to 20 mev , thus treating collective and non - collective excitations on the same computational basis , without resorting to any external enhancement factor .",
    "the parity - projected level densities in the above mentioned range were well reproduced by back - shifted bethe formulae with parity - dependent parameters .",
    "the smmc method was later applied to other even - even nuclei , from fe to ge  @xcite , as well as to odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei  @xcite in the same mass region and energy range . in the case of odd fermion systems ,",
    "the weight functions appearing in the auxiliary field integrals are not necessarily positive , thus giving rise to a well - known sign problem , recently overcome by the particle - number reprojection method  @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned smmc calculations are well reproduced by back - shifted bethe formulae , which are thus able to fit theoretical level densities which include correlations among nucleons , at least for nuclei which are not strongly deformed , in an energy range of the order of some ten mev .",
    "the possibility to include correlations in the bethe formula has been known empirically for years , and is reflected in the fact , already quoted in section 2 , that the average value of the level density parameter at the neutron binding energy , @xmath159 mev@xmath160 , is about as twice as the value predicted by the fermi gas model , thus accounting for low energy correlations other than those described by the energy backshift .",
    "a theoretical justification of the validity of the shifted bethe formula beyond the independent particle approximation was recently given in ref .",
    "there , it was shown that the shifted bethe formula is closely connected with a continuous binomial level density in a finite space , defined by three parameters , which can be extracted from the three lowest moments of a hamiltonian of any rank .",
    "we believe , however , that the mean - field approach to nuclear level densities is still worthy of development and applications , were it not for the fact that the smmc method is still very far from applicability to a region of the periodic chart and to an energy range as large as those allowed in a self - consistent mean - field approximation ( see , in particular , ref .",
    "moreover , at excitation energies higher than about 2 mev / nucleon , easily attainable in current heavy ion reactions , we expect not only vanishing correlations , but also failure of the bethe formula , which predicts an exponentially increasing level density , physically unreasonable at excitation energies approaching the nuclear binding energy , as already discussed at the end of the previous section . under such extreme conditions , microcanonical , or canonical calculations based on",
    "a self - consistent relativistic mean - field approximation may prove a very valuable approach , as we intend to show in a future work .",
    "in this section we discuss and compare with experimental data the results of illustrative calculations of total level densities of few magic and semi - magic nuclei .",
    "a crucial parameter of our calculations is the density of single - particle states at the fermi energy .",
    "the single - nucleon spectra are calculated with the relativistic mean - field model with energy - dependent effective mass . for the initial parameterization of the effective lagrangian ( meson masses and meson - nucleon couplings ) we have chosen , instead of the nl3 effective interaction  @xcite adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the older parameter set nl1 @xcite . even though nl1 is admittedly inferior to nl3 in reproducing the bulk nuclear properties , it yields a more realistic magic gap @xmath161 in @xmath2pb , considered also in the present work . for this reason , nl1 has also been adopted as the starting parameterization in the recent analysis @xcite of shape coexistence phenomena in the pt - hg - pb region .",
    "in addition , the half - width of the interval in which the @xmath23 and @xmath125 mean - field potentials are assumed to be linearly dependent on energy , has been reduced from 10 to 5 mev . in this way",
    ", we obtain more realistic energies of the single - particle states above the fermi surface , which have a particularly strong effect on the calculated total level densities .",
    "the linear energy dependence of the @xmath23 and @xmath125 mean - field potentials is determined by the parameter @xmath162 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ve ] ) .",
    "the input parameters used in the calculation of three illustrative cases , @xmath163pb , @xmath164sn and @xmath165ni , are collected in table [ tab : mf - par ] ( parameters of the relativistic mean - model ) , and table [ tab : calc - par ] ( the parameters @xmath162 of the energy - dependent effective mass , the pairing strengths and the phonon energies ) .    starting from the heaviest nucleus , @xmath2pb , @xmath162 has been adjusted so as to reproduce the binding energy , the cumulative number of discrete levels as a function of excitation energy , and the @xmath166wave neutron resonance spacing , @xmath167 , measured in the @xmath168 reaction . as is known , in the case of an odd - mass target nucleus with @xmath169 neutrons and ground - state spin - parity @xmath170 , @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are , respectively , the neutron binding energy and the density of levels with spin - parity @xmath174 of the compound nucleus with @xmath175 neutrons .",

    "the bbf curve appears to be in better agreement with the total state density of ref .",
    "@xcite , probably in connection with the fact that the latter does not include an explicit vibrational enhancement .    for lighter spherical nuclei , there are experimental data on total level densities mainly below 20 mev , where the vibrational enhancement factor discussed in section [ sec : coll - eff ] is expected to play a significant role .",
    "this is indeed the case for the semi - magic nuclei @xmath1sn and @xmath0ni , whose calculated level densities are compared with experimental data in figs . [",
    "fig : sn114 ] and [ fig : ni60 ] , respectively . here",

    "the total state densities including collective effects are equally well reproduced by bbf and gbf with the parameters given in table [ tab : fit - par ] up to about 40 mev , while the damping of the collective factor with increasing energy yields systematically lower results than bbf and gbf at higher excitation .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite about the range of validity of bbf .",
    "the relativistic mean - field model , the combinatorial algorithm and the vibrational enhancement factor adopted in the present work are strictly valid for spherical nuclei only . in order to investigate the possible extension to open shell nuclei ,",
    "we have performed calculations also for slightly deformed nuclei in the @xmath182 mass region , in particular @xmath158fe and @xmath183mn , for which experimental data of the same quality as @xmath165ni are available",
    ".    comparison of calculated and experimental level densities , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fe56 ] and [ fig : mn55 ] for @xmath158fe and @xmath183mn , respectively , indicates , however , that for open - shell nuclei there are some problems still to be solved . to bring these problems into focus , level densities",
    "have been calculated with @xmath162 = 0 and are plotted without any collective enhancement factor .    in general , total level densities below 10",
    "mev turn out to be slightly overestimated by our calculation , as a consequence of the degeneracy of the ground state , as shown by the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : fe56 ] and [ fig : mn55 ] , where calculated and experimental cumulative number of levels are compared .",
    "the low energy data are derived from the cumulative number of discrete levels , whose spectra are somewhat different from those of spherical nuclei . in particular ,",
    "both @xmath158fe and the even - even core of @xmath183mn , i. e. @xmath184cr , show a ground - state rotational band including the @xmath176 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 states , while the energy of the @xmath188 state is of the order of magnitude of the quadrupole phonon energy from phenomenological systematics .",
    "it is not expected that the single - particle level scheme from a mean field with spherical symmetry and the combinatorial spindis algorithm for spherical nuclei adopted in the present work produce a very realistic distribution of non - collective states at low energy , neither can a simple vibrational enhancement factor compare well with the experimental level densities above 15 mev , where both vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom are simultaneously excited and coupled together .",
    "therefore , necessary conditions for extension of the present mean - field approach to open - shell nuclei appear to be the evaluation of single - particle level schemes at realistic deformations and the use of a combinatorial algorithm , such as the recursive one  @xcite , valid also for deformed systems .",
    "once a more realistic single - particle scheme is obtained , more reliable conclusions can be drawn about the treatment of the particle - vibration coupling , simulated by the @xmath162 parameter of our model .",
    "corresponding calculations  @xcite of the effective nucleon mass in a cranked nilsson - bcs approach to the structure of statically deformed nuclei show that the frequency dependent factor , the so - called @xmath8 mass , @xmath189 , of the effective nucleon mass is somewhat different from that obtained for open - shell nuclei with spherical symmetry , i. e. the one that could be simulated with the present version of our model .",
    "moreover , the derivation of a collective enhancement factor for deformed nuclei is nontrivial and requires an investigation of the effect of coupling of different collective modes , such as rotations and surface vibrations , not only with the fermion degrees of freedom , but also among themselves .",
    "the latter coupling , often neglected in the level density formalisms , is expected to play an important role in the energy range considered in the present work .    for the sake of comparison ,",

    ", however , the model contains a phenomenological treatment of surface vibrations and of their coupling to the single - particle degrees of freedom .",
    "a fully microscopic formulation would require generation of phonons in a relativistic rpa approximation and explicit formulation of the particle - vibration coupling , presently simulated by the linear energy dependence of the meson fields .",
    "the planned extension to non - magic deformed nuclei , necessary for the present approach to become competitive with the non - relativistic mean - field approaches @xcite , requires calculation of deformed single - particle schemes , an appropriate combinatorial algorithm and a collective factor taking into account rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom , and their coupling as a function of excitation energy , or temperature",
    ".    there is , moreover , a kind of level density problem where the relativistic mean - field approach should have no true competitors , i. e. the calculation of nuclear level densities above the threshold of pion production and up to the total binding energy of the system , where a static non - relativistic mean - field approximation loses its validity .",
    "the present linear energy dependence of the classical meson fields is , admittedly , a low - energy approximation , to be properly modified on the basis of the results of the relativistic brckner - hartree - fock theory  @xcite , which predicts a faster decrease of the real potential well with increasing excitation energy and , consequently , a sizable change of the single - particle level scheme , as well as the formation of an imaginary potential well , whose depth is expected , on the basis of the dirac phenomenology analysis of the scattering of polarized intermediate - energy nucleons , to increase quadratically with energy above the threshold of pion production .",
