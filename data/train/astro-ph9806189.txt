    "the availability of wide - field ccd detectors on large telescopes has renewed interest in the luminosity functions of galaxies in clusters , which can now be determined to @xmath8 at 100 mpc , a luminosity limit comparable to that formerly reached in the local group ( e.g. , van den bergh 1992 ) .",
    "coma , as one of the nearest ( @xmath9 ) and richest ( r=2 ) abell clusters is , together with virgo , one of the best studied systems ( see mazure et al .",
    "1998 for a compendium of recent work on the coma cluster ) .    optical luminosity functions for bright galaxies in coma are consistent with a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function having @xmath10 ( e.g. , lopez - cruz et al .  1997 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are better fit by a power - law with @xmath11 ( in the schechter formalism ) .",
    "these properties are similar to those of the luminosity function in virgo ( sandage , binggeli & tammann 1985 ) and in fornax ( ferguson & sandage 1988 ) .",
    "recently , however , lobo et al .",
    "( 1997a ) have claimed a steep @xmath12 band slope for faint galaxies in coma ( @xmath13 ) , supporting earlier claims for a large population of dwarf galaxies in clusters ( e.g. , de propris et al .",
    "table 1 summarizes recent determinations of the faint - end slope of the luminosity function in the coma cluster .",
    "it is generally difficult to relate optical luminosity functions to the underlying mass distribution , owing to our incomplete understanding of star formation in galaxies .",
    "it has been known for some time that cluster galaxies have steeper lf s than in the field ( binggeli , sandage & tarenghi 1990 ) , in contrast to cold dark matter ( cdm ) models which predict @xmath14 ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "a steep optical lf may be compatible with a flat mass function if dwarf galaxies have their luminosities boosted by fading starbursts ( hogg & phinney 1997 ) .",
    "there is indeed some evidence for recent ( 1  2 gyr ago ) star formation among dwarfs in coma ( donas , milliard & laget 1995 ) and in virgo and fornax as well ( held & mould 1994 and references therein ) .    infrared luminosities are known to be less sensitive to star formation and to correlate well with dynamical mass ( gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 ) . therefore infrared luminosity functions should be expected to approximate better the underlying mass function .",
    "a study of the infrared luminosity function of coma is timely because of the recent publication of the first infrared - selected luminosity functions for field galaxies ( gardner et al .",
    "1997 - g97 , szokoly et al .",
    "1998 ) , allowing a comparison of mass distributions in two environments of highly different densities . while mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) have recently presented a @xmath15-band study of faint galaxies in coma , their survey covers only 41 arcmin@xmath0 and hence the luminosity function is not well constrained .",
    "eisenhardt et al .",
    "( 1998 - hereafter edgswd ) have obtained photometry in @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 infrared selected galaxies in a @xmath19 field in the core of the coma cluster .",
    "edgswd selected objects at @xmath1 ( and required confirmation at @xmath20 ) to provide a baseline for comparison to @xmath15 selected samples in more distant clusters ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 , 1998 ) , and also because the @xmath1 data reached approximately 0.5 mag deeper . here we use these data to derive the @xmath1 luminosity function for galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "the conversion from @xmath1 to @xmath17 is provided in  3.1 .",
    "a detailed description of the data , observations , data reduction and photometry is given in edgswd , and is not repeated here , except for some essential points .",
    "we assume a redshift of 6950 km s@xmath21 ( mazure & gurzadyan 1998 ) .",
    "star - galaxy separation was determined in the @xmath22 band using the kron ( 1980 ) @xmath23 parameter ( edgswd ) . because the available membership information is qualitatively different for bright vs. faint galaxies , we consider them separately . for galaxies with",
    "@xmath2 redshifts are available in the literature ( lobo et al .",
    "all galaxies with @xmath24 km / s are assumed to be members and at the same distance . for fainter galaxies ( @xmath25 )",
    "we use two independent methods to correct for non - cluster members .",
    "following mazure et al.(1988 ) and biviano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we assume that galaxies within @xmath26 magnitudes of the @xmath5 color - magnitude relation defined by the brighter early type galaxies are members .",
    "the relation and the color selection criterion are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we also use the infrared counts by huang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , tranformed to the @xmath1 band using our @xmath27 color magnitude relation , to estimate the amount of contamination from background and foreground galaxies .",
    "galaxies are then counted in 0.5 magnitude bins .",
    "the resulting luminosity function is shown in figure 2 .      for bright galaxies we choose to fit a schechter function , using the maximum likelihood technique of sandage , tammann & yahil ( 1979 ) .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the inset in figure 2 shows the @xmath28 error ellipse .",
    "the three brightest objects are excluded from the fit , since we are unable to fairly sample their space density and such objects fall outside of the extrapolation of the schechter function at bright magnitudes ( schechter 1976 ) .    to illustrate the uncertainty in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , 1000 monte carlo simulations were generated in which 111 objects were drawn from a schechter function whose parameters were the best fit to our ` original ' data and with errors as described in edgswd .",
    "these artificial data were fitted using the same method as above , and the results are shown in the inset in figure 2 .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , both the color selection method and the background subtraction method result in a significant excess of faint galaxies relative to the schechter function for bright galaxies determined above .",
    "fitting to the @xmath5 selected counts for @xmath6 we find @xmath31 .",
    "could this slope be an artifact ?",
    "magnitude errors and spurious detections can cause an artificial steepening in the derived slope ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "however , the estimated errors are smaller than the width of the bin even for the faintest galaxies considered , and spurious detections should be few because objects were required to be detected in both the @xmath20 and @xmath1 images .",
    "in fact we are quite likely to have _ underestimated _ the number of dwarfs due to the difficulty in detecting low surface brightness galaxies against the bright infrared background .",
    "the completeness is estimated from monte - carlo simulations to be @xmath32 to @xmath33 for galaxies with @xmath34 kpc and @xmath35 to @xmath36 for @xmath37 kpc ( edgswd ) , where @xmath38 is the first moment of the light distribution ( kron 1980 ) . because fornax cluster dwarfs typically have effective radii @xmath39 kpc ( ferguson 1989 ) , we do not expect this to be a large correction .",
    "misclassifying stars as galaxies can not account for the upturn : there are no significant discrepancies in star / galaxy classification between edgswd and lobo et al .",
    "( 1997a )    a more serious concern is that the slope of the infrared background counts is similarly steep ( equivalent to @xmath40 , huang et al .",
    "1997 ) , raising the possibility that an incorrect removal of contaminating objects is responsible for the upturn .",
    "we consider this unlikely because ( i ) counts obtained via color selection agree well with those derived via background subtraction techniques ; a narrower color - selection strip ( @xmath41 ) yields a slightly flatter slope ( @xmath42 ) but the upturn remains significant ; ( ii ) the excess required to account for our result is a factor of 2.5 above the estimated background counts ; and ( iii ) galaxy counts in the direction of the coma cluster are found to be in satisfactory agreement with those in the general field ( secker & harris 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the question of cluster membership for these galaxies is the dominant uncertainty in our measurement of the faint end slope , and we are planning on a redshift survey of the faint sample , in order to address the issue of their membership .",
    "time has already been awarded on the wiyn telescope to pursue this investigation .",
    "the infrared luminosity function derived for bright galaxies ( @xmath43 ) is in good agreement with that at @xmath22 ( lopez - cruz et al .",
    "1997 ) as well as at @xmath12 ( lobo et al .",
    "1997a ) : all are reasonably well matched by a schechter function with a ` flat ' ( @xmath44 ) power law .",
    "this argues for a relatively small contribution from young stars in these galaxies .",
    "our value of @xmath29 is in excellent agreement with the @xmath45 value reported by g97 , using @xmath46 from edgswd and a @xmath47-correction of 0.05 .",
    "both this method and a direct determination from the @xmath17 data of edgswd , to the @xmath48 limit of g97 , yield @xmath49 .",
    "the observed @xmath50 yields @xmath51 , vs. @xmath52 for the virgo cluster ( sandage et al .  1985 ) .",
    "the agreement is somewhat fortuitous given the uncertainty in @xmath29 due to our smaller sample and the fact that we do not properly survey the brightest galaxies .",
    "our bright galaxy slope ( @xmath4 ) agrees well with g97 s @xmath53 but depends on the cutoff magnitude .",
    "using the g97 cutoff gives @xmath54 in @xmath1 and @xmath55 from the @xmath17 data , suggesting that our results may be influenced by the presence of the ` dip ' in the optical luminosity function of coma at @xmath56 ( lobo et al .",
    "1997a ) , equivalent to @xmath57 .",
    "the ir luminosity functions ( and hence mass functions ) of bright galaxies in the field and in this rich cluster appear to be similar , despite the roughly thousand - fold difference in environmental density .",
    "this agreement is surprising because of the different morphological mixes and , presumably , merger histories for these galaxies . if mass is truly the defining parameter in controlling the bulk properties of galaxies and their morphology ( see gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) this similarity supports models in which large galaxies form at high redshift and evolve passively to the present epoch , and in which mergers are relatively unimportant ( a scenario also favored by stanford et al .",
    "1998 ) .      for galaxies fainter than @xmath58",
    ", we find a steep upturn in the luminosity function ( @xmath59 ) . due to the uncertainty in cluster membership , this result",
    "should be considered to support claims for a steep luminosity function for dwarfs , rather than providing a precise estimate of the slope of the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "nevertheless , we detect a population of dwarfs about two times larger than expected from the @xmath60 found by many previous authors ( table 1 ) .    because @xmath1 luminosity is linearly correlated with mass for field and virgo cluster galaxies ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) , the most natural interpretation of the steep infrared slope is that it represents a real increase in the space density of low mass galaxies in coma , rather than an enhanced star formation rate in such objects .",
    "there is some suggestion in table 1 that the luminosity function slope increases with clustercentric radius ( e.g. lobo et al .",
    "such a trend might be caused by a higher incidence of mergers or tidal disruption in the dense cluster core .",
    "on the other hand dwarfs may actually _ form _ in mergers ( krivitsky & kontorovich 1997 ) and in tidal tails ( hunsberger , charlton & zaritsky 1996 ) .",
    "the reality of the trend towards steeper slopes at larger radii remains inconclusive : lopez - cruz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and secker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find @xmath60 at @xmath22 in fields of similar size to ours , identical to the value found at @xmath22 by bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in a small field near the cluster center .",
    "another possibility is that most of the luminosity from dwarf galaxies comes from fading bursts of star formation , leading to steeper faint end slopes at longer wavelengths , as predicted by hogg & phinney ( 1997 ) .",
    "because the burst luminosity becomes fainter and redder with time , there is an increased probability of finding faint , red galaxies .",
    "given the difference in mass to ( near infrared ) light ratio of a @xmath61 vs. a @xmath62 year old population ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , starbursts producing @xmath63 of the mass in the underlying population every few hundred million years would satisfy the requirements of the hogg & phinney model . although some fornax cluster dwarfs show evidence for a substantial young population ( held & mould 1994 ) , none of the local group dwarfs , with the possible exception of the fornax dwarf ( gallagher & wyse 1994 ) show such evidence .",
    "again , existing data on the correlation of slope with wavelength are inconclusive ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is also plausible that the dwarf galaxy h luminosity function is more accurately a schechter function than a power law , and the steep slope we measure is only an approximation to the exponential portion of the function .",
    "binggeli , sandage & tammann ( 1988 ) suggest @xmath64 for dwarfs , corresponding to @xmath65 in coma . in this case",
    "the data of mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) , which samples a smaller field to @xmath66 , provides a better estimate of the faint end slope .",
    "a comparison with field dwarfs is difficult , since no infrared survey has yet reached luminosity limits as deep as ours ( which is equivalent to @xmath67 . using a @xmath17-selected sample with 110 redshifts , szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do find a steeper slope ( @xmath68 ) in their field infrared luminosity function than g97 , despite the similar luminosity limit ( @xmath69 ) of the samples analyzed , but we consider g97 s result more reliable as it is based on @xmath18 redshifts .",
    "if the similarity between the ir and optical luminosity functions in coma also holds true in the field , the very steep slope ( @xmath70 ) found by loveday ( 1997 ) at @xmath71 for faint galaxies in the stromlo - apm survey may foretell an upturn in the ir field luminosity function as well .",
    "the 2mass survey should settle this issue , as it will reach @xmath72 at the distance of the virgo cluster ( skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "our results for coma support the existence of an universal galaxy luminosity function , which is well approximated by a flat schechter function for bright galaxies and a steep power - law for dwarfs ( trentham 1998b ) . as demonstrated by edgswd and skrutskie et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is now possible to obtain ` panoramic ' data in the infrared : other clusters should now be studied with the same methods , in order to determine the mass function of galaxies in clusters and study the effects of their environment .",
