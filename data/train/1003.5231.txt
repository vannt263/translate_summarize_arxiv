    "iijima [ 1 ] found after his electron diffraction analysis that carbon nanotubes ranging 4 to 30 nanometers ( nm ) in diameter have helical multi - walled structures .",
    "single - wall nanotube ( swnt ) have about one nanometer in diameter and micrometers ( @xmath0 m ) in length .",
    "ebbesen et al .",
    "[ 2 ] measured the electrical conductivity @xmath1 of carbon nanotubes and found that @xmath1 varies depending of the temperature @xmath2 , the tube radius @xmath3 and the pitch @xmath4 .",
    "experiments show that swnt can be either semiconducting or metallic , depending on how they are rolled up from the graphene sheets [ 3 ] . in the present work we shall present a microscopic theory of the electrical conductivity of semiconducting swnt , starting with a graphene honeycomb lattice , and developing a bloch electron dynamics based on a rectangular cell model .",
    "a swnt can be formed by rolling a graphene sheet into a cylinder .",
    "the graphene which forms a honeycomb lattice is intrinsically anisotropic as we shall explain it in more detail later in section ii .",
    "moriyama et al .",
    "[ 4 ] fabricated 12 swnt devices from one chip , and observed that two of the swnt samples are semiconducting and the other 10 are metallic , the difference in the room temperature resistance being of two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "the semiconducting swnt samples show an activated - state temperature behavior .",
    "why are there two sets of samples showing very different behavior ?",
    "we believe the answer to this question arises as follows .     and a pith @xmath4 . + ( b ) its unrolled plane . ]",
    "the line passing the centers of the nearest - neighbor carbon hexagons forms a helical line around the nanotube with a pitch @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , a section of the circular tube with a pitch @xmath4 is drawn .",
    "its unrolled plane is shown in ( b ) . the circumference @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the tube radius , likely contains an integral number of the carbon hexagons ( units ) .",
    "the pitch @xmath4 , however , may or may not contain an integral number of units . in the first alternative ,",
    "the nanotube is periodic with the period @xmath4 along the tube axis .",
    "then , there is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath6-vector along the tube .",
    "a  hole \" which has a positive charge @xmath7 and a size of a unit ring of height @xmath4 and radius @xmath3 can go through inside the positively charged carbon wall .",
    "an  electron \" having a negative charge @xmath8 and a similar size is attracted by the carbon wall , and hence it can not go straight inside the wall .",
    "thus , there should be an extra  hole \" channel current in a swnt .",
    "moriyama et al .",
    "[ 4 ] observed a  hole \"- like current after examining the gate voltage effect .",
    "the system should have the lowest energy if the unit ring contains an integer set @xmath9 of carbon hexagons , which may be attained after annealing at high temperatures .",
    "this should happen if the tube length is comparable with the circumference .",
    "the experimental tube length is much greater than the circumference , and the pitch angle can be varied continuously . in the fabrication process",
    "the pitch is not controlled .",
    "the set of irrational numbers is greater in cardinality than the set of rational numbers .",
    "then , the first case in which the unit contains an integer set @xmath9 of hexagons must be the minority .",
    "this case then generates a semiconducting transport behavior .",
    "we shall show later that the transport requires an activation energy .",
    "fujita and suzuki [ 5 ] showed that the  electrons \" and  holes \" must be activated based on the rectangular cell model for graphene .",
    "if a swnt contains an irrational number of carbon hexagons , which happens more often , then the system does not allow a conduction along the tube axis .",
    "the system is still conductive since the conduction electrons (  electrons \" ,  holes \" ) can go through in the tube wall .",
    "this conduction is two - dimensional ( 2d ) as can be seen in the unrolled configuration , which is precisely the graphene honeycomb lattice .",
    "this means that the conduction in the carbon wall should be the same as the conduction in graphene if the effect of the finiteness of the radius is neglected .",
    "we consider graphene in section ii .",
    "the current band theory of the honeycomb crystal is based on the wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell model [ 3,6 ] .",
    "the ws model [ 6 ] is suitable for the study of the ground - state energy of the crystal . to describe the bloch electron motion in terms of the mass tensor [ 7 ] a new theory based on the cartesian unit cell not matching with the natural triangular crystal axes",
    "is more appropriate .",
    "the conduction electron moves as a wave packet formed by the bloch waves as pointed out by ashcroft and mermin in their book [ 7 ] .",
    "this picture is fully incorporated in our new theoretical model .",
    "we consider a graphene which forms a 2d honeycomb lattice .",
    "the normal carriers in the electrical transport are  electrons \" and  holes \" .",
    "the  electron \" (  hole \" ) is a quasi - electron which has an energy higher than the fermi energy _ and _ which circulates clockwise ( counterclockwise ) viewed from the tip of the applied magnetic field vector .",
    " electrons \" (  holes \" ) are excited on the positive ( negative ) side of the fermi surface with the convention that the positive normal vector at the surface points in the energy - increasing direction .",
    "we assume that the  electron \" (  hole \" ) wave packet , called the  electron \" (  hole \" ) hereafter , has the charge @xmath10 and a size of a unit carbon hexagon , generated above ( below ) the fermi energy @xmath11 .",
    "we shall show that ( a ) the  electron \" and  hole \" have different internal charge distributions and different effective masses , ( b ) the  electron \" and  hole \" are thermally activated with different energy gaps @xmath12 , ( c ) the  electrons \" and  holes \" move in different easy channels in which they travel , and ( d ) graphene is intrinsically anisotropic but the charge transport is isotropic if all channels are included into consideration .",
    "the positively - charged  hole \" tends to stay away from positive ions c@xmath13 , and hence its charge is concentrated at the center of the hexagon .",
    "the negatively - charged  electron \" tends to stay close to the c@xmath13 hexagon and its charge is concentrated near the c@xmath13 hexagon . in our model ,",
    "the  electron \" and  hole \" both have charge distributions , and they are not point particles .",
    "hence , their masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 must be different from the gravitational mass @xmath16 kg . because of the different internal charge distributions , the  electrons \" and  holes \" should have the different effective masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the  electron \" may easily move with a smaller effective mass in the direction [ 111 @xmath17-axis ] @xmath18 [ 110 ] than perpendicular to it as we see presently . here",
    ", we use the conventional miller indices for the hexagonal lattice with omission of the @xmath17-axis index [ 7 ] . for the description of the electron motion in terms of the mass tensor [ 7 ]",
    ", it is convenient to introduce cartesian coordinates , which do not match with the crystal s natural ( triangular ) axes .",
    "we may choose the rectangular unit cell with side length @xmath19 as shown in fig .",
    "2 . note that graphene has a mirror ( reflection ) symmetry with respect to the @xmath20- and @xmath21-axis .",
    "the brillouin zone in the @xmath6-space is unique : a rectangle with side lengths @xmath22 .",
    "the  electron \" ( wave packet ) may move up or down in [ 110 ] to the neighboring hexagon sites passing over one c@xmath13 .",
    "the positively charged c@xmath13 acts as a welcoming ( favorable ) potential valley for the negatively charged  electron \" .",
    "the same c@xmath13 acts as a hindering potential hill for the positively charged  hole \" .",
    "the  hole \" can however move easily sideways along the @xmath20-axis over on a series of vacant sites , each surrounded by six c , without meeting the hindering potential hills .",
    "thus , the easy channel directions for  electrons \" and  holes \" are [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] , respectively .",
    "let us consider the system ( graphene ) at 0 k. if we put an electron in the crystal , then the electron should occupy the center o of brillouin zone , where the lowest energy lies .",
    "additional electrons occupy points neighboring o in consideration of pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "the electron distribution is lattice - periodic over the entire crystal in accordance with the bloch theorem [ 8 ] .",
    "the uppermost partially filled bands are important for transport properties discussion .",
    "we consider such a band .",
    "the 2d fermi surface which defines the boundary between the filled and unfilled @xmath6-space ( area ) is _ not _ a circle since @xmath23 symmetry is broken @xmath24 .",
    "the  electron \" effective mass is less in the direction [ 110 ] than perpendicular to it .",
    "that is , the system has two different masses and it is _ intrinsically anisotropic_. if the electron number is raised by the gate voltage applied perpendicular to the plane , then the fermi surface more quickly grows in the easy - axis ( @xmath21- ) direction than in the @xmath20-direction . the fermi surface must approach the brillouin boundary at right angles because of the inversion symmetry possessed by honeycomb lattice [ 9 ] . then at a certain voltage ,",
    "a  neck \" fermi surface must be developed .",
    "the same easy channels in which the  electron \" runs with a small mass , may be assumed for other hexagonal directions , [ 011 ] and [ 101 ] .",
    "the currents run in the three channels @xmath25 , [ 011]$ ] , and @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the total current ( magnitude ) along the field direction @xmath0 is proportional to [ 10 ] @xmath27 note that this current does not depend on the angle @xmath28 between the field direction ( @xmath0 ) and the channel current direction ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "more detailed discussion can be found in ref . [ 9 ] .",
    "hence , the graphene does not show anisotropy in the conductivity .",
    "we have seen earlier that the  electron \" and  hole \" have different internal charge distributions and therefore have different effective masses .",
    "which carriers are easier to be activated or excited ?",
    "this question can be answered without considering channeling .",
    "the  electron \" is near the positive ions and the  hole \" is farther away from the ions .",
    "hence , the gain in the coulomb interaction is greater for the  electron \" .",
    "that is , the  electrons \" are more easily activated ( or excited ) .",
    "the presence of the welcoming c@xmath13 ions in the channel direction also enhances this inequality .",
    "we may represent the activation energy difference by @xmath30 the thermally - activated ( or excited ) electron densities are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and 2 represent the  electron \" and  hole \" , respectively .",
    "the pre - exponential factor @xmath33 is the density at high - temperature limit .",
    "let us consider the long swnt rolled with a graphene sheet .",
    "the charge may be transported by the channeling  electrons \" and  holes \" in the graphene wall .",
    "but the  holes \" within the wall can also contribute to the charge transport .",
    "because of this extra channel inside the carbon nanotube ,",
    " holes \" can be the majority carriers in nanotubes although  electrons \" are the dominant carriers in graphene .",
    "moriyama et al .",
    "[ 4 ] studied the electrical transport in semiconducting swnt in the temperature range 2.6 - 200 k , and found from the filed ( gate voltage ) effect that the carriers are  hole \"- like .",
    "their data are reproduced in fig .",
    "]    the conductivity depends on the pitch of the swnt .",
    "the helical line is defined as the line passing the nearest neighbors of the c - hexagons .",
    "the helical angle @xmath28 is the angle between the helical line and the tube axis .",
    "the degree of helicity @xmath34 may be defined as @xmath35 for a macroscopically large graphene the conductivity is isotropic as we saw in section ii .",
    "the conductivity @xmath1 in ( semiconducting ) swnt depends on this helicity @xmath34 .",
    "this is a kind of a finite size effect .. the circumference is finite while the tube length is macroscopic .    in a four - valance - electron conductor such as graphene",
    "all electrons are bound to ions , and there is no conduction at 0 k. if a  hole \" having the charge @xmath7 and the size of a unit ring is excited , then this  hole \" can move along the tube axis with the activation energy @xmath36 and the effective mass @xmath37 . both @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend on the radius and the pitch .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the conductivity of semiconducting swnt .",

    "+ ( d ) cooper pairs ( pairons ) formed by the phonon - exchange attraction , which move in the graphene wall .",
    "in actuality , one of the currents may be dominant , and be observed .    in the normal ohmic conduction due to the conduction electrons",
    "the resistance is proportional to the sample ( tube ) length .",
    "then , the conductivity @xmath1 is given by the drude formula : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the carrier charge @xmath45 the effective mass , @xmath46 the carrier density , and @xmath47 the relaxation ( collision ) time .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath48 is the inverse of the relaxation time . if the impurities and phonons are scatterers , then the rate @xmath49 is the sum of the impurity scattering rate @xmath50 and the phonon scattering rate @xmath51 : @xmath52 the impurity scattering rate @xmath50 is temperature - independent and the phonon scattering rate @xmath51 is temperature @xmath53-dependent .",
    "the phonon scattering rate @xmath51 is linear in @xmath2 above around 2 k : @xmath54 the temperature dependence should arise from the carrier density @xmath55 and the phonon scattering rate @xmath51 .",
    "writing the @xmath2-dependence explicitly , we obtain from ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) @xmath56 moriyama et al .",
    "[ 4 ] used the arrhenius plot for the data above 20 k and obtained the activation energy @xmath57 by studying the field ( gate voltage ) effect , the carriers were found to be  hole \"- like .",
    "thus , the major currents observed can be interpreted in terms of the  holes \" moving within the tube wall .    this  hole \" axial transport depends on the unit ring containing @xmath58 hexagons .",
    "since the pitch and the circumference have distributions , the activation energy @xmath36 should also have a distribution . hence the obtained value in eq .",
    "( 9 ) must be regarded as the averaged value .",
    "liu et al . [ 10 ] systematically measured the resistance @xmath59 of swnt under hydrostatic pressures , and fitted their data by using 2d _ variable range hopping _ ( vrh )",
    "theoretical formula [ 11 ] : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a fit ( temperature ) parameter and @xmath62 a ( resistance ) parameter .",
    "vrh theory [ 11 ] is applicable when highly random disorders exist in the system .",
    "an individual swnt ( annealed ) is unlikely to have such randomness .",
    "we take a different view here .",
    "the scatterings are due to normally assumed impurities and phonons . but",
    "carriers (  holes \" ) have a distribution in the unit cell size .",
    "hence the distribution of the activation energy introduces the flattening of the arrhenius slope by the factor 1/3 .",
    "compare eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the  hole \" size is much greater than the usually assumed atomic impurity size and the phonon size , which are of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "this size mismatch may account for a ballistic charge transport observed by frank et al .",
    "[ 13 ] and others [ 14 ] .",
    "more careful studies are required to establish the cause of the ballisticity .",
    "we now go back to the data shown in fig .",
    "below 20 k the currents observed are very small and they appear to approach a constant in the low temperature limit ( large @xmath63 limit ) . these currents , we believe , are due to the cooper pairs .",
