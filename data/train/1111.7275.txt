    "the problem of quantum quench , i.e. the response of a system to a time dependent coupling , has recently attracted a lot of attention in several areas of many - body physics , particularly because of progress in cold atom experiments @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this problem is interesting for at least two reasons .",
    "the first relates to the question of thermalization .",
    "suppose we start with the ground state and then turn on a time dependent coupling which again approaches a constant at late times .",
    "does the system evolve into some kind of steady state ?",
    "if so , is the state `` thermal '' in any sense ?    the second question deals with the situation where the quench takes place across a value of the parameter where there is an equilibriium critical point .",
    "in this case there is some evidence that the time evolution carries some universal features of the critical point .",
    "assuming that there is only one scale which governs the behavior of the system in the critical region , one can , e.g. derive scaling properties of one point functions following adaptations of the early work of kibble and zurek @xcite .",
    "suppose the coupling approaches the critical coupling linearly , i.e. ( g - g_c ) ~vt these arguments then show that the one point function of an operator with conformal dimension @xmath0 at the critical point has a scaling behavior @xcite , ~(v)^ f(tv^ ) where @xmath1 is the dynamical critical exponent and @xmath2 is the correlation length exponent .",
    "another manifestation of such universal behavior appears in @xmath3 dimensional field theories which are quenched _ suddenly _ to a critical point . in this case ,",
    "powerful methods of boundary conformal field theory can be used to obtain the time dependence of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "for example the one point function of a generic operator with conformal dimension @xmath0 behaves as ~e^- where @xmath4 denotes a length scale which characterizes the initial theory away from criticality .",
    "@xmath4 is of course not universal , so neither is the relaxation time @xmath5 .",
    "however , the ratio of the relaxation times for two _ different _ operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 with conformal dimensions @xmath8 and @xmath9 is universal , = unlike equilibrium critical phenomena there is no general theoretical framework to understand such scaling relations . in particular , there are very few theoretical tools available to study such systems when they are strongly coupled .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to explore if the ads / cft correspondence @xcite - @xcite is useful in this problem .    in this contribution",
    "we will summarize results obtained in this approach .",
    "the work on thermalization is in collaboration with tatsuma nishioka and tadashi takayanagi @xcite .",
    "the work on quench across critical points is in in collaboration with pallab basu @xcite .    in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , couplings of the boundary field theory are boundary values of a bulk field . in the regime where supergravity is valid , the problem of quantum quench then reduces to a classical problem with given initial and boundary conditions .",
    "this problem has been studied when the time dependent coupling is the boundary metric or the gauge theory coupling ( i.e. the boundary value of the dilaton ) .",
    "suppose this coupling is a constant in the far past and future , and has a smooth time dependent profile at intermediate times .",
    "in the bulk description this corresponds to a disturbance created on the boundary which propagates in the bulk . under suitable conditions ,",
    "this leads to black hole formation in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the correlators at future time would then be thermal with a temperature characterized by the hawking temperature .",
    "the time scale after which this happens depends on the nature of the correlators , but turns out to be always smaller than what one would expect from a conformally invariant system evolving to a thermal state .",
    "thus , in this case thermalization of the field theory is signalled by black hole formation .",
    "for homogeneous planar collapse ( i.e. a space independent coupling in poincare patch ) , a black hole is always formed . in the case of homogeneous collapse in global ads ,",
    "a black hole is formed when the rate of change is fast enough compared to the scale set by the radius of the sphere on which the boundary theory lives .    in other situations ,",
    "e.g. a slow variation of the coupling for global ads , a black hole is not formed so long as the supergravity approximation is valid .",
    "rather , if the coupling becomes _ weak _ at some time , the bulk string frame curvature grows large , leading to a breakdown of the supergravity approximation - thus mimicking a space - like singularity @xcite .",
    "for the case of a slow variation of the coupling it turns out that the gauge theory remains well defined and may be used to show that a smooth passage through this region of small coupling is possible without formation of a large black hole .",
    "related scenarios appear in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of our main aims is to study quantum quench across critical points .",
    "many such critical points can be studied in setups where a subset of the bulk fields can be treated in a probe approximation . in this approximation , these probe fields provide the essential physics and their backreaction to the background gravity can be ignored , typically suppressed by @xmath10 .",
    "this motivates us to study the problem of quantum quench in situations where such a probe approximation is valid",
    ".    we will first consider defect field theories which arise as dual descriptions of a set of probe branes in the @xmath11 bulk @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used extensively to study flavor physics , as well as models with possible applications to condensed matter systems .",
    "the nice feature of this approach is that the boundary field theory is known , though they typically have supersymmetry . in this case",
    "a quantum quench of couplings in this subsector becomes a classical motion of these probe branes , with specified time dependent boundary conditions at the @xmath12 boundary @xcite .",
    "we investigate the question of thermalization in this context .",
    "since the background geometry is unchanged in this approximation any black hole which is formed due to the quench is not visible .",
    "we will find that thermalization is nevetheless visible - this manifests itself as the formation of an apparent horizon on the brane worldvolume .    in the second setup",
    "we consider a `` bottom - up '' bulk theory of gravity with a neutral scalar field @xcite , where one writes down a bulk theory and _ assume _ that there is some dual field theory on the boundary . in this specific instance , the background is a @xmath13 charged black brane and the coupling of the scalar is large , so that its backreaction to the geometry is small . when the mass of the scalar lies in the range @xmath14 there is always a critical temperature below which the trivial solution is unstable .",
    "equivalently , for a given temperature , whenever the mass is below a certain value , the trivial solution is unstable . in this regime",
    "there is a new nontrivial static , stable solution whose `` non - normalizable '' part vanishes .",
    "this means that in the dual theory there is a new phase where the expectation value of the operator dual to this scalar is non - zero , even in the absence of any source . for any nonzero temperature",
    "there is a continuous phase transition with mean field exponents at the critical mass . at zero temperature ( i.e. when the background is an extremal brane ) the transition persists , but is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "this setup is similar to that of holographic superconductors @xcite and has been proposed as models for antiferromagentic transitions .",
    "we consider quench across this critical point by working at the critical mass , but turning on a time dependent source which crosses zero ( i.e. the critical point ) at some time @xcite .",
    "we show that the dynamics of the bulk scalar is dominated by a zero mode of the radial operator in the critical region when the rate of change of the source is small , this leads to a landau - ginsburg type dynamics with dynamical critical exponent @xmath15 , and a resulting scaling behavior of the order parameter .",
    "probe branes in the bulk of @xmath12 have been used to introduce flavor in the standard ads / cft correspondence .",
    "consider for concreteness @xmath16 whose dual is @xmath17 super - yang - mills in @xmath18 dimensions with gauge group @xmath19 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath20 dp branes which wrap a @xmath21 .",
    "possible supersymmetric wrappings are summarized in table ( [ tabl1 ] ) .",
    ".[tabl1]probe branes in @xmath16 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dp branes give rise to new hypermultiplet fields .",
    "these live on the intersection of the dp branes with the d3 branes which gave rise to the @xmath16 geometry . from the point of view of the @xmath22 theory",
    "the hypermultiplets live on a lower dimensional defect . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the bulk theory is the original supergravity together with the action of branes coupled to it .    in the limit of @xmath23 the backreaction of the probe branes on the background @xmath16 geometry can be ignored and the entire bulk theory is given by the action of these branes moving in the fixed background geometry .",
    "we will take the brane action to be of the dbi type . in the dual theory",
    "this means we can consider the defect field theory by itself , and ignore the effect of hypermultiplet loops .    as is standard in the ads / cft correspondence , the boundary values of the dbi fields",
    "are identified with sources for the dual operators in the dual field theory .",
    "consider for example the case of a d5 brane .",
    "let us write the @xmath16 metric in the form ds^2 = ( y^2+r^2)[-dt^2+dx_1 ^ 2+dx_2 ^ 2+dx_3 ^ 2]+ [ dr^2+r^2d_2 ^ 2+dy^2+y^2d(^_2)^2 ] [ one]the d5 brane is wrapped along @xmath24 .",
    "the fields in the dbi action are @xmath25 , which are the transverse coordinates to the brane .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is then the mass of the hypermultiplet fields coming from @xmath27 open strings joining the d5 brane with the stack of @xmath28 three branes which produce the background geometry .",
    "thus a time dependent boundary value of @xmath29 is a time dependent mass for the hypermultiplets .",
    "therefore a quantum quench in this dual theory may be implemented simply by providing a time dependent boundary condition for the dbi field .",
    "however the dbi fields are the transverse coordinates of the branes - so this corresponds to a motion of the edge of the brane .",
    "this disturbance sets up a wave along the brane and therefore correponds to an excited state of the defect field theory .",
    "our aim is to figure out the nature of this state at late times .    in the full theory ,",
    "such a disturbance would lead to a deformation of the background geometry and possibly lead to black hole formation , which would appear as thermalization in the boundary field theory .",
    "we want to explore if any signature of thermalization remains in the probe approximation .",
    "the following sections summarize some salient points of work with tatsuma nishioka and tadashi takayanagi @xcite .",
    "the essential physics is in fact apparent in the simplest example - d1 branes in @xmath16 . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to write the @xmath16 metric as ds^2 = 2drdv - f(r)dv^2+r^2 d^2+(d^2+^2d^2+^2d^2_3 ) if we are using the poincare patch , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the flat metric on @xmath32 , while in the global patch @xmath33 and @xmath31 is the round metric on @xmath34 .",
    "we have used eddington - finkelstein coordinates in the @xmath35 part .",
    "the d1 brane is along @xmath36 and its action is given by the standard dbi action obtained from the induced metric .",
    "the dynamical fields on the brane are @xmath37 and the coordinates contained in @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear from the symmetries that one can have a class of solutions of the form ( r , v ) ,  = with all the other coordinates held constant .",
    "the equations of motion which follow from the dbi action is best written by using the advanced ef coordinate @xmath38 as well as @xmath39 _",
    "u_v + _ v _ u ( ) + _ u _ v ( ) = 0  , [ uveqnmotion ] where l = 1-_u _ v  .",
    "it is easy to see that any @xmath40 which satisfies either @xmath41 or @xmath42 is a solution of ( [ uveqnmotion ] ) . in particular ,",
    "a solution which is a function of @xmath39 alone represents the retarded effect of a boundary value of @xmath40 .",
    "the induced metric produced by such a retarded solution is given by [ indf ] ds_ind^2 = -f(r ) dudv + ( _ v ) ^2 dv^2 = 2drdv - [ f(r)-(_v ) ^2]dv^2  .",
    "this is a two - dimensional ads vaidya metric which has an apparent horizon at @xmath43 , provided this equation has a solution for real @xmath44 . in the poincare metric",
    "there is always a solution for real @xmath44 , while in global coordinates , this is not guaranteed .",
    "depending on the profile of @xmath45 , the apparent horizon may or may not develop into an event horizon .",
    "an example where it does is given by the profile ( v ) = _ 0 ( v + ( kv ) ) [ prof1 ] which leads to the following equation for the location of the apparent horizon for the poincare patch r = _ 0 ( 1 + ( kv ) )",
    "[ ahprof1 ] this asymptotes to an event horizon at @xmath46 .",
    "this profile represents a d1 brane which starts from rest and spins with an increasing spin , asymptoting to a constant rotation rate .",

    "at late time this becomes an event horizon ]    for strings which eventually stop spinning , the apparent horizon does not develop into an event horizon , but recedes back to @xmath47 .",
    "for example if ( v ) = _ 0(1 + ( kv ) ) [ prof2 ] the apparent horizon is located at r = [ ahprof2 ] the function ( [ prof2 ] ) and the location of the apparent horizon is shown in figure ( [ fig : prof2 ] ) and ( [ fig : ahprof2 ] )    location of the apparent horizon .",

    "the apparent horizon now recedes back to @xmath47 ]    in global @xmath12 the equation which determines the apparent horizon is given by @xmath49 which does not always have a solution for real @xmath44 .",
    "for example , a brane whose end point is uniformly rotating has @xmath50 - this would lead to an event horizon only when @xmath51 .",
    "the poincare patch solutions represent injection of energy from the boundary , which flows into the poincare horizon . in the global solutions ,",
    "the energy flows from a point of the boundary to the antipodal point of the @xmath34 .",
    "fluctuations of the brane around this classical solution will feel the effect of an apparent horizon on the worldsheet .",
    "let us choose a static gauge where the worldsheet coordinates are identified with two of the space - time coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "the transverse coordinates are @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath11 metric can be then written as ds^2 = g_ab ( x^a , x^i ) dx^adx^b + g_ij(x^a , x^k ) dx^i dx^j  .",
    "[ fluc1 ] expanding around a classical solution @xmath54 , x^i(x^a ) = x_0^i ( x^a ) + y^i(x^a )  , [ fluc3 ] this leads to the following action for quadratic fluctuations s_2 = d^2 _ 0^ab g_ij ( ^a , x_0^i ) _ a y^i _ b y^j  .",
    "[ fluc8 ] where @xmath55 denotes the induced metric due to the background solution @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , the fluctuations of @xmath57 i.e. all fluctuations in @xmath58 directions are minimally coupled massless scalars on the worldsheet , while the fluctuations of the boundary gauge theory spatial directions @xmath59 have an additional factor of @xmath60 coming from the fact that @xmath61 along these directions .",
    "it is well known that fields which live on a space - time with an apparent horizon behave approximately thermally if the apparent horizon lasts long enough @xcite . while the standard derivation of hawking radiation assumes the presence of an event horizon , the essential physics is the large redshift , which is present near an apparent horizon as well . in our case , profiles like ( [ prof1 ] ) lead to exact thermality at late times since the apparent horizon evolves into an event horizon . on the other hand profiles like ( [ prof2 ] )",
    "lead to an effective `` time dependent temperature '' in the dual theory , which of course makes sense when the time variation is slow enough .",
    "the thermal nature of the state produced by time dependence becomes clear from a calculation of the fluctuation of the end - point of the string .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the fluctuations of a string suspended from the horizon of a ads black brane ended at a flavor d - brane near the boundary of ads are dual to brownian motion of the corresponding quark in the hot @xmath62 gauge theory . in this case",
    "the bulk black brane metric induces a worldsheet metric which has a horizon .",
    "the fluctuations then reflect hawking radiation from the worldsheet horizon .    in the d - brane solutions considered above",
    ", the bulk metric has no horizon .",
    "however due to the motion of the d - brane , the induced metric on the worldvolume can develop a horizon .",
    "since the fluctuations of @xcite comes purely from properties of the induced metric it is natural to expect that a similar phenomenon appears in our case .",
    "the result of this calculation for fluctuations in the @xmath40 direction is ( y^(t - t^))^2 & ~ &  ,  ( t - t^ )  , ( y^(t - t^))^2 & ~ & -  ,  ( t - t^ )  , while for fluctuations in the @xmath63 direction are ^2 & ~ &  ,  t m^2  , & ~ & |t - t^|  ,  t m^2  .",
    "the rotating @xmath64 brane solution corresponds to a time dependent coupling in the @xmath22 theory coupled to hypermultiplets living on the zero dimensional defect .",
    "the d1-d3 system is 1/4-bps and the d1-d3 open strings lead to the two complex scalars @xmath65 of hypermultiplets which belong to the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of the color @xmath66 gauge group .",
    "let us express the three complex adjoint scalar fields in the @xmath67 super yang - mills by @xmath68 .",
    "these correspond to cartesian coordinates in the transverse @xmath69 composed of @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the 5-sphere .",
    "we choose @xmath72 such that its phase rotation describes the one in the @xmath40 direction and that @xmath73 is equivalent to @xmath74 .",
    "the time dependent coupling term which corresponds to a uniformly rotation d1-brane is given by dt .",
    "[ intti ] the justification for this is given in @xcite .",
    "for non - uniform rotation with a profile @xmath75 the exponential factors are simply replaced by @xmath76 .",
    "thus , from the boundary theory point of view we have a time dependent coupling - this leads to thermalization .",
    "note that this is thermalization of only the hypermultiplet sector - the vector multiplet sector is unchanged in the lowest order of this approximation .",
    "thermalization in higher dimensional field theories can be also investigated by considering higher dimensional branes in the bulk of @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to construct uniformly rotating d7 and d5 branes using a combination of analytic and numerical methods .",
    "while these d5 and d7 solutions have been obtained earlier in @xcite , the implications to thermalization was not realized .",
    "quench - like solutions ( i.e. solutions where the rotation vanishes in the asymptotic past and the asymptotic future ) can be obtained numerically as well @xcite .",
    "rotating d5 branes are dual to a time dependent mass of the hypermultiplets in the dual 2 + 1 dimensional defect field theory . rotating d7 branes are dual to a time dependent phase of the mass of fermions in the hypermultiplet , as well as a time dependent bosonic potential .",
    "the essential physics is similar to the d1 brane descibed in the previous subsection , viz .",
    "an apparent horizon is formed and the fluctuations respond in a thermal fashion .",
    "an additional signature of dissipation appears when we consider probe d3 branes obtained by performing t - duality on the d1 brane solution described above along @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions . in this case the worldvolume is a @xmath18 dimensional theory and the dual defect field theory is @xmath77 dimensions .",
    "it turns out that in this case one can turn on a background electric field on the worldvolume of a uniformly rotating d3 brane .",
    "this means we are turning on a chemical potential and a charge density for the corresponding global charge in the dual field theory , in addition to a time dependent coupling .",
    "the fluctuations of the gauge field around this background now react to the apparent horizon of the induced metric .",
    "this leads to an electrical conductivity @xmath78 , whose behavior as a function of the frequency @xmath2 is quite similar to drude theory at low frequencies",
    ". however the real part of @xmath79 approaches a constant at large frequency , as is typical in a 2 + 1 dimensional critical theories .",
    "this is shown in figures ( [ fig : one ] ) and ( [ fig : two ] )    imaginary part of @xmath78 . ]",
    "imaginary part of @xmath78 . ]      an interesting example of the process of thermalization due to formation of an apparent horizon on the worldvolume concerns the thermalization of the meson sector of @xmath22 yang - mills theory due to a time dependent chemical potential @xcite . as usual , quarks are introduced by placing a set of d7 branes and a chemical potential corresponds to a worldvolume electric field .",
    "this is made time dependent by coupling to a time dependent external current , i.e. by injecting quarks from outside . as in the previous examples this results in the formation of an apparent horizon with a characteristic temperature .",
    "for other effects of this phenomenon see @xcite .",
    "finally the formation of apparent horizons in these examples is similar to acceleration horizons on worldvolumes discussed in @xcite and related phenomena have been studied in @xcite .",
    "as we discussed above , quantum quench is particularly interesting when the time dependent coupling crosses a critical point .",
    "the probe approximation has turned out to be quite useful for studying holographic critical points .",
    "such phase transitions are known to occur for various probe branes @xcite .",
    "another class of probe fields appear in discussions of holographic superconductors @xcite .",
    "this setup consists of a charged scalar field in the presence of a charged black brane .",
    "when the gauge coupling is large , the backreaction of the scalar and the gauge field to the background geometry can be ignored . in this case , for a given mass of the scalar field there is a critical temperature below which the scalar condenses - this is interpreted as superfluidity in the boundary theory .",
    "the phase transition between the ordered and disordered phases is a critical point .",
    "an even simpler setting consists of a neutral scalar field with a quartic coupling which is large enough to ensure that a probe approximation is reliable .",
    "as shown in @xcite for suitable values of the parameters , this model displays a critical point of the type encountered in antiferromagentic phase transitions . in this section",

    "<S> we consider a probe bulk scalar field in the background of a ads black brane . in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , this system undergoes a critical phase transition at some temperature when the source for the dual operator vanishes . for a time dependent source which goes across this critical point , we show that a zero mode of the bulk field dominates the dynamics and leads to scaling behavior of the order parameter as a function of the rate of change .    </S>",
