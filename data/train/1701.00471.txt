    "a surface s crater population is said to be in equilibrium when the terrain loses visible craters at the same rate that craters are newly generated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the apollo era , a number of studies have been widely conducted that have provided us with useful empirical information about crater count equilibrium on planetary surfaces . in a cumulative size - frequency distribution ( csfd ) , for many cases , the slope of the equilibrium state in log - log space ranges from -1.8 to -2.0 if the slope of the crater production function is steeper than -2 @xcite .    when new craters form , they erase old craters . there are three crater erasure processes that primarily contribute to crater count equilibrium ( figure [ fig : equilibrium4 ] ) .",
    "the first process is cookie - cutting , in which a new crater simply overlaps old craters .",
    "complete overlap can erase the craters beneath the new crater",
    ". however , if overlapping is incomplete , the old craters may be still visible because the rim size of the new crater strictly restricts the range of cookie - cutting .",
    "cookie - cutting is a geometric process and only depends on the area occupied by new craters .    however , since craters are not two - dimensional circles but three - dimensional depressions , cookie - cutting is ineffective when a newly - formed crater is smaller than a pre - existing crater beneath it .",
    "the second process considers this three - dimensional effect .",
    "this process is sometimes called sandblasting , which happens when small craters collectively erode a large crater by inducing downslope diffusion , thus filling in the larger depression over time @xcite .",
    "lastly , blanketing by ejecta deposits covers old craters outside the new crater rim ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the thickness of ejecta blankets determines how this process contributes to crater count equilibrium .",
    "however , it has long been noted that they are relatively inefficient at erasing old craters @xcite . for these reasons , this study formulates the ejecta - blanketing process as a geometric overlapping process ( like cookie - cutting ) and neglects it in the demonstration exercise of our model .    to our knowledge , @xcite is the only researcher known to have conducted comprehensive laboratory - scale demonstrations for the crater count equilibrium problem . in a 2.5-m square box",
    "filled 30-cm deep with quartz sand , he created six sizes of craters to generate crater count equilibrium .",
    "the photographs taken during the experiments captured the nature of crater count equilibrium ( figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "his experiments successfully recovered the equilibrium level of crater counts observed in heavily cratered lunar terrains .",
    "earlier works conducted analytical modeling of crater count equilibrium @xcite .",
    "@xcite theoretically explored the crater count equilibrium mechanism by considering simple circle emplacements .",
    "the role of sandblasting in crater erosion was proposed by @xcite , followed by a study of sandblasting as an analog of the diffusion problem @xcite .",
    "each of these models addressed the fact that the equilibrium slope was found to be 2 , which does not fully capture the observed slope described above .",
    "@xcite also developed a time - evolution model for geometric saturation for single sized craters .",
    "advances in computers have made monte - carlo simulation techniques popular for investigating the evolution of crater count equilibrium .",
    "earlier works showed how such techniques could describe the evolution of a cratered surface @xcite .",
    "since then , the techniques have become more sophisticated and have been capable of describing complicated cratering processes @xcite .",
    "many of these monte carlo codes represent craters on a surface as simple circles or points on a rim @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the earlier analytical models and some monte - carlo techniques that simply emplaced circles was that crater erasure processes did not account for the three - dimensional nature of crater formation .",
    "as cratering proceeds , diffusive erosion becomes important @xcite .",
    "techniques that model craters as three - dimensional topographic features capture this process naturally @xcite ; however , these techniques are computationally expensive .    here",
    ", we develop a model that accounts for the overlapping process ( cookie - cutting and ejecta - blanketing ) and the diffusion process ( sandblasting ) to describe the evolution of crater count equilibrium while avoiding the drawbacks discussed above . similar to @xcite ,",
    "we approach this problem analytically . in the proposed model",
    ", we overcome the computational uncertainties and difficulties that his model encountered , such as his complex geometrical formulations .",
    "since the proposed model has an analytical solution , it is efficient and can be used to investigate a larger parameter space than numerical techniques .",
    "although a recent study reported a model of the topographic distribution of cratered terrains , which have also reached crater count equilibrium at small crater sizes , on the moon @xcite , the present paper only focuses on the population distribution of craters .",
    "we emphasize that the presented model is a powerful tool for considering the crater count equilibrium problem for any airless planets . in the present exercise",
    ", we consider a special size range between 0 and @xmath0 to better understand crater count equilibrium . also , although the crater count equilibrium slope may potentially depend on the crater radius , we assume that it is constant .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows . in section [ sec : sfd ] , we introduce a mathematical form that describes the produced crater csfd derived from the crater production function .",
    "section [ sec : modelling ] provides the general formulation of the proposed model .",
    "this form will be related to the form derived by @xcite but will be more flexible to consider the detailed erasure processes . in section [ sec : generalformulation",
    "] , we derive an analytical solution to the derived equation . in section [ sec : behavior ] , we apply this model to the crater count equilibrium problems of the sinus medii region and the apollo 15 landing site on the moon , and demonstrate how we can use observational crater counts to infer the nature of the crater erasure processes .",
    "to characterize crater count equilibrium , we require two populations : the crater production function and the produced craters .",
    "the production function is an idealized model for the population of craters that is expected to form on a terrain per time and area . in this study",
    ", we use a csfd to describe the produced craters . the crater production function in a form of csfd",
    "is given as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the slope , @xmath3 is a constant parameter with units of m@xmath4 s@xmath5 , @xmath6 is a cratering chronology function , which is defined to be dimensionless ( e.g. , for the lunar case , @xcite ) , and @xmath7 is the crater radius . for notational simplification ,",
    "we choose to use the radius instead of the diameter .",
    "in contrast , the produced craters are those that actually formed on the surface over finite time in a finite area .",
    "if all the produced craters are counted , the mean of the produced crater csfd over many samplings is obtained by factorizing the crater production function by a given area , @xmath8 , and by integrating it over time , @xmath9 .",
    "we write the produced crater csfd as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , \\\\   x & = & \\frac{\\hat x}{\\int_{0}^{t_s } \\hat x dt } \\:\\ : \\text{[s$^{-1}$ } ] , \\label{eq : x } \\\\ x & = & \\int_0^t x dt .",

    "for this case , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in these forms",
    ", @xmath15 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for instance , it is convenient to select @xmath15 such that @xmath16 recovers the produced crater csfd of the empirical data at @xmath17 . also , we set the initial time as zero without losing the generality of this problem .",
    "later , we use @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the formulation process below .    given the produced crater csfd , @xmath20 , the present paper considers how the visible crater csfd , @xmath21 , evolves over time .",
    "the following sections shall omit the subscript , @xmath22 , from the visible crater csfd and the produced crater csfd to simplify the notational expressions .",
    "we first introduce how the observed number of craters on a terrain subject to impact bombardment evolves over time . the most direct way to investigate this evolution would be to count each newly generated and erased craters over some interval of time .",
    "this is what monte carlo codes , like ctem , do @xcite . in the proposed model",
    ", the degradation processes are parameterized by a quantity that describes how many craters are erased by a new crater .",
    "we call this quantity the degradation parameter",
    ".    consider the number of visible craters of size @xmath23 on time step @xmath24 to be @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the production rate of craters of this size is such that exactly one crater of this size is produced in each time step . in our model",
    ", we treat partial degradation of the craters by introducing a fractional number .",
    "note that since we do not account for the topological features of the cratered surface in the present version , this parameter does not distinguish degradation effects on shapes such as a rim fraction and change in a crater depth .",
    "this consideration is beyond our scope here .",
    "for instance , if @xmath26 , this means that at time @xmath27 , the first crater is halfway to being uncounted . ,",
    "at time 1 there is only one crater emplaced . ]",
    "if there is no loss of craters , @xmath25 should be equal to @xmath24 .",
    "when old craters are degraded by new craters , @xmath25 becomes smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "we describe this process as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the degradation parameter describing how many craters of size @xmath23 lose their identities ( either partial or in full ) on time step @xmath24 , and @xmath30 is a constant factor that includes the produced crater csfd and the geometrical limits for the @xmath23th - sized craters . in the analytical model ,",
    "we average @xmath31 over the total number of the produced craters .",
    "this operation is defined as @xmath32 equation ( [ eq : bar_kappa ] ) provides the following form : @xmath33 in the following discussion , we use this averaged value , @xmath34 , and simply call it the degradation parameter without confusion .      to help develop our model , we first consider a simplified case of a terrain that is bombarded only by craters with a single radius .",
    "this case is similar to the analysis by @xcite .",
    "we consider the number of craters , instead of the fraction of the cratered area that was used by @xcite .",
    "consider a square area in which single sized craters of radius , @xmath35 , are generated and erased over time .",
    "@xmath36 is the number of the produced craters , @xmath8 is the area of the domain , @xmath37 is the number of visible craters at a given time , and @xmath38 is the maximum number of visible craters of size @xmath23 that is possibly visible on the surface ( geometric saturation ) . in the following discussion , we define the time - derivative of @xmath36 as @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath37 is the quantity that we will solve , and @xmath38 is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the geometric saturation factor , which describes the highest crater density that could theoretically be possible if the craters were efficiently emplaced onto the surface in a hexagonal configuration @xcite . for single sized circles @xmath42 .",
    "the number of visible craters will increase linearly with time at rate , @xmath43 , at the beginning of impact cratering .",
    "after a certain time , the number of visible craters will be obliterated with a rate of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 means the probability that a newly generated crater can overlap old craters .",

    "this process provides the first - order ordinal differential equation , which is given as @xmath47 the initial condition is @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq : eqmsingle ] ) is given as @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq : nsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to proceed further , we must understand the physical meaning of the degradation parameter .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eqmsingle ] ) indicates that the degradation parameter represents how many old craters are erased by a new crater .",

    "complex geometric considerations were necessary , and there were many uncertainties .",
    "we will see that the extension of section [ sec : singlesize ] makes our analytical formulation clear and flexible so that the developed model can take into account realistic erasure processes .",
    "we create a differential equation for this case based on equation ( [ eq : eqmsingle ] ) , which states that for a given radius , the change rate of visible craters is equal to the difference between the number of newly emplaced craters per time and that of newly erased craters per time .",
    "we first develop a discretized model and then convert it into a continuous model . in the discussion , we keep using the notations defined in section [ sec : singlesize ] .",

    "further investigations and improvements will be necessary as we made five assumptions in the present study .",
    "first , we simply considered the limit condition of the crater radius , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "however , this assumption neglects consideration of a cut - off effect on crater counting .",
    "such an effect may happen when a local area is chosen to count craters on a terrain that reaches crater count equilibrium . due to this effect",
    ", large craters in the area may be accidentally truncated , and the craters counted there may not follow the typical slope feature .",
    "second , we ignored the effect of ejecta - blanketing in our exercises .",
    "however , it is necessary to investigate the details for it to give stronger constraints on the crater count equilibrium problem .",
    "third , we assumed that the equilibrium state is characterized by a single slope .",
    "however , an earlier study has shown that the equilibrium slope could vary at different crater sizes from case to case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to adapt such complex equilibrium slopes , we require more sophisticated forms of equation ( [ eq : alphasc ] ) .",
    "fourth , the current version of this model does not distinguish crater degradation with crater obliteration .",
    "for example , if @xmath183 in equation ( [ dsd ] ) , there is a chance that craters would be degraded due to sandblasting but not obliterated . at this condition , they all would be visible , while equation ( [ dsd ] ) predicts some obliteration .",
    "fifth , the measured crater radius can increase due to sandblasting , while the current model does not account for this effect .",
    "we will attempt to solve these problems in our future works .",
    "we finally address that although we took into account cookie - cutting , ejecta - blanketing , and sandblasting as the physical processes contributing to crater count equilibrium in this study , we have not implemented the effect of crater counting on the degradation parameter . according to @xcite , the visibility of degraded craters could depend on several different factors : sharpness of craters , surface conditions , and image qualities ( such as image resolution and sun angles ) .",
    "also , purposes that a crater counter has also play a significant role in crater counting",
    ". a better understanding of this mechanism will shed light on the effect of human crater counting processes on crater count equilibrium .",
    "we will conduct detailed investigations and construct a better methodology for characterizing this effect .",
    "we developed an analytical model for addressing the crater count equilibrium problem .",
    "we formulated a balance condition between crater accumulation and crater degradation and derived the analytical solution that described how the crater count equilibrium evolves over time .",
    "the degradation process was modeled by using the degradation parameter that gave an efficiency for a new crater to erase old craters .",
    "this model formulated cookie - cutting , ejecta - blanketing , and sandblasting to model crater count equilibrium .    to formulate the degradation parameter , we considered the slope functions of the ratio of one crater to the other for the following cases : if the size of newly emplaced craters was smaller than that of old craters , ejecta - blanketing and sandblasting were dominant ; otherwise , ejecta - blanketing and cookie - cutting mainly erased old craters . based on our formulation of the degradation parameter",
    ", we derived the relationship between this parameter and a fitting function obtained by the empirical data .",
    "if the slope of the crater production function was higher than 2 , the equilibrium state was independent of the crater production function .",
    "we recovered the results by earlier studies that the slope of the equilibrium state was always independent of the produced crater csfd .",
    "if the physical processes were scale - dependent , the slope deviated from the slope of 2 .    using the empirical results of the sinus medii region and the apollo 15 landing site on the moon , we discussed how our model constrained the degradation parameters from observed crater counts of equilibrium surfaces .",
    "we assumed that the ejecta - blanketing process was negligible .",
    "this exercise showed that this model properly described the nature of crater count equilibrium .",
    "further work will be conducted to better understand the slope functions of the degradation parameters , which will help us do validation and verification processes for both our analytical model and the numerical cratered terrain model ctem @xcite .",
