    "in recent years there has been a huge increase in research and development of nanoscale science and technology , with the study of energy and electron transport playing important role .",
    "focusing on thermal transport , landauer - like results for steady - state heat flow have been proposed earlier @xcite .",
    "subsequently , based on quantum langevin equation approach , many authors successfully obtained a landauer - type expression @xcite .",
    "alternatively , nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method has been introduced to investigate mesoscopic thermal transport , which is particularly suited for use with ballistic thermal transport and readily allows the incorporation of nonlinear interactions @xcite . generally speaking , in the lead - junction - lead system",
    ", steady - state heat current of ballistic thermal transport flowing from left lead to right lead has been described by the landauer - like formula , which was derived first for electrical current , as @xmath0\\left(f_{l}-f_{r}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the bose - einstein distribution for phonons , and @xmath2 $ ] is known as the transmission coefficient .",
    "based on nonequilibrium green s function method , @xmath2 $ ] can be calculated through the caroli formula in terms of the green s functions of the junction and the self - energies of the leads , @xmath3= & \\mathrm{tr}\\left(g^{r}\\gamma_{r}g^{a}\\gamma_{l}\\right),\\label{eq : caroli formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the green s function of the junction , and @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the self - energy terms @xmath6 are due to the semi - infinite leads on the left , @xmath7 , and on the right , @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the retarded and advanced , respectively , both for the self - energies as well as for the green s functions in the formula .",
    "the specific form was given from negf formalism by meir and wingreen @xcite for electronic case and later by yamamoto and watanabe for phonon transport @xcite , while caroli et al .",
    "first obtained a formula for the electronic transport in a slightly more restricted case @xcite .",
    "also , mingo et al .",
    "have derived a similar expression for transmission coefficient using `` atomistic green s function '' method @xcite .",
    "very recently , das and dhar @xcite derive the landauer - like expression from plane wave picture using lippmann - schwinger scattering approach .",
    "the landauer - like formula describes the situation in which the junction is small enough compared to the coherent length of the waves so that it could be treated as elastic scattering where the energy is conserved .",
    "furthermore , it has been assumed that the two leads are decoupled which physically means there is no direct tunneling between the two leads . through modern nanoscale technology , small junction",
    "is easily realized such as in certain nanoscale systems , for instance , a single molecule or , in general , a small cluster of atoms between two bulk electrodes . in that case , the electrode surfaces of the bulk conductors may be separated by just a few angstroms so that some finite electronic coupling between the two surfaces is inevitable taking into account the long - range interaction . in order to solve this problem , di ventra suggested that @xcite we can choose our `` sample '' region ( junction ) to extend several atomic layers inside the bulk electrodes where screening is essentially complete so that the above coupling could be negligible .",
    "it turns out to be correct using this trick to avoid the interaction between the two leads , which will be verified in a simple example at the end of the paper , even though we , to some limited extent , modify the initial condition necessary to derive landauer - like formula in negf formalism and repartition the total hamiltonian .",
    "however , this procedure or trick could not be always done due to some topological reason such as studying heat current in rubin model @xcite in which the other end of the two semi - infinite leads is connected ( a ring problem ) .",
    "actually this somewhat trivial example is not so artificial since it is equivalent to using periodic boundary condition in rubin model .",
    "furthermore , the modification of the initial product state will certainly affect the behavior of the transient heat current . if we want to study the transient and steady heat current @xcite in a unified way , the repartitioning procedure which changes the model is not acceptable .",
    "so in this work we will try to derive a compact formula applicable to this general model including lead - lead interaction for steady - state heat current according to negf formalism , and correspondingly obtained a caroli - like formula for transmission coefficient .",
    "furthermore , an interface transmission coefficient formula in the negf formalism will be given as a special case of the general caroli - like formula .",
    "also , the standard caroli formula follows as a one - line proof .",
    "the paper is organized into two main sections . in",
    ", we develop our formalism to derive our generalized expression for the steady current directly taking coupling between leads into account .",
    "based on this general formula , we will recover the caroli formula and derive a computationally efficient interface formula in .",
    "then we apply this formalism to an illustrative model system in and show the results of numerical calculations .",
    "also , we will apply the interface formula obtained in to derive an explicit expression for transmission coefficient in .",
    "finally we conclude with a short discussion in section  v.",
    "as was mentioned previously , we will consider the lead - junction - lead model initially prepared in product state @xmath11 .",
    "we can imagine that left lead @xmath12 , center junction @xmath13 , and right lead @xmath14 in this model was in contact with three different heat baths at the inverse temperature @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively for time @xmath18 . at time @xmath19 ,",
    "all the heat baths are removed , and coupling of the center junction with the leads and the interaction between the two leads are switched on abruptly .",
    "now the total hamiltonian of the lead - junction - lead system becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21@xmath22 represents coupled harmonic oscillators , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are column vectors of transformed coordinates and corresponding conjugate momenta in region @xmath25 .",
    "the superscript @xmath26 stands for matrix transpose . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual couplings between the junction and the two leads , which are certainly necessary to establish the heat current .",
    "now the new term representing interaction between two leads @xmath29 will modify transmission coefficient greatly , which is our main interest .",
    "it is worth mentioning that nonlinear interaction could be added inside the center junction and dealt with using self - consistent approach in the framework of negf , which has been done by many authors @xcite .",
    "contour - ordered green s functions are the central objects in the negf formalism , among which the directly derived relation say , dyson equation , could be readily transformed to all kinds of relations among the real - time green s functions by langreth theorem @xcite . and many interesting quantities such as the current we will consider in the following subsection could be easily related to the proper real - time green s functions .",
    "steady - state contour - ordered green s functions are defined as @xmath30\\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the steady - state density operator , in which time @xmath32 introduced for convenience of later discussion could take any finite time since the switch - on time @xmath33 will be let to go to @xmath34 at the end in order to establish steady - state heat current .",
    "@xmath35 is operator in the heisenberg picture and similarly for @xmath36 .",
    "the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 are on the contour from time @xmath39 to @xmath40 and back from @xmath40 to time @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath41 etc .",
    "are the time evolution operators of the full hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath42 is the contour - ordering super - operator .",
    "there is a strong assumption here which is all we need in the whole derivation , where we assume steady state could be established from initial product state after infinite time so that all the steady - state real - time green s function depend only on the difference of the two time arguments .",
    "this intuitively reasonable assumption is not always guaranteed and there is a specific example about how to establish steady - state heat current in ref @xcite .",
    "after @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and transforming to the interaction picture , where the total hamiltonian @xmath45 is separated into the free part @xmath46 and the interaction part @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48\\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is operator in the interaction picture and similarly for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 are on the keldysh contour @xcite @xmath52 from @xmath34 to @xmath40 and back from @xmath40 to @xmath34 .",
    "the contour variables such as @xmath53 only influence the ordering of the operators under @xmath54 , and @xmath55 has the same meaning as @xmath56 with real time @xmath57 .",
    "expanding the exponential to perform a perturbation expansion and using feynman diagrammatic technique , we can obtain dyson equations for @xmath58 such as @xmath59 , etc .",
    "all these dyson equations could be symbolically lumped into a compact matrix expression , @xmath60 where @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , and @xmath65\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] @xmath66 are equilibrium contour - ordered green s functions for the free subsystems , which are easy to calculate directly .",
    "no approximation is needed here , since the coupling @xmath67 is quadratic .",
    "certainly , heat current flowing out of the left lead in steady state does nt depend on time and based on its definition @xmath68 $ ] for @xmath69 , we could simply obtain @xmath70\\right)_{ll}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ = & -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}\\,\\hbar\\omega\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\left(v_{red}g_{red}^{<}\\left[\\omega\\right]\\right)_{ll}\\right],\\label{eq : ini - current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71\\right)_{ll}$ ] denotes the @xmath72 part submatrix of @xmath73 $ ] . observing the structure of @xmath74\\right)_{ll}\\right]$ ] , we note that the size of the @xmath75 $ ] making nonzero contribution to @xmath76 is completely determined by nonzero entries in the symmetric total coupling matrix @xmath77 .",
    "so we do nt need the full @xmath75 $ ] which is an infinite matrix due to the two semi - infinite leads . according to this observation",
    ", we choose the reduced square matrix @xmath78 $ ] to be the corresponding submatrix of @xmath75 $ ] determined by the row indexes of nonzero row vectors of coupling matrixes @xmath79 plus full center part row indexes inside the total coupling matrix @xmath77 for the rows of @xmath78 $ ] , the column indexes of nonzero column vectors of coupling matrixes @xmath80 plus full center part column indexes inside the total coupling matrix @xmath77 for the columns of @xmath78 $ ] . in order to calculate the lesser green s function @xmath78 $ ] ,",
    "closed dyson equation for reduced contour - ordered green s function @xmath81 is needed .",
    "equation is the starting point and indeed it is also true that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is similarly defined as @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the submatrix of original @xmath77 after crossing out all the zero column and row vectors except for the possible zero vectors whose row or column indexes are the center ( junction ) ones .",
    "actually , @xmath84 is just the corresponding submatrix of @xmath86 just like @xmath85 .    from now on , for notational simplicity",
    ", we omit the subscript @xmath87 of all the steady - state green s functions and all the coupling matrices with the understanding that these matrices are of finite dimensions .    using the langreth theorem @xcite and fourier transforming the obtained all kinds of real - time green s functions",

    "this new function plays important role for our generalized caroli formula and for an interface formula to be derived below . here",
    ", fluctuation dissipation theorem @xmath92=f_{\\alpha}\\left[\\omega\\right]\\left(g_{\\alpha}^{r}-g_{\\alpha}^{a}\\right),\\;\\alpha = l , c , r.$ ] has been used .",
    "so is @xmath93 , which is responsible for the vanishing of junction temperature dependence of final steady - state current formula . with respect to various green s functions and specific convention of fourier transform",
    ", we use the same definitions as ref .",
    "@xcite .    substituting the eq . into steady current expression",

    ", we could get @xmath96 and @xmath97 . using the relations such as @xmath98(where the superscript @xmath99 stands for transpose conjugate ) etc .",

    "together with @xmath110-f_{r}\\left[-\\omega\\right]=-f_{l}\\left[\\omega\\right]+f_{r}\\left[\\omega\\right]$ ] , steady current @xmath76 can be simplified further to the final expression @xmath111\\left(f_{l}-f_{r}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , it is the same as expected that landauer - like formula still apply to this general case taking lead - lead interaction into account . and",
    "this landauer - like formula with the explicit general transmission coefficient expression is our central result .",
    "now we need to know how to calculate @xmath112 in order for specific applications . according to the corresponding reduced one of eq .",
    ", we can obtain a closed equation for @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . since @xmath116 ,",
    "now all the quantities necessary to obtain general transmission coefficient @xmath117 could be expressed in terms of retarded or advanced form of submatrix of @xmath83 and submatrix of @xmath85 , which are both easily obtained .",
    "first , we recover caroli formula for transmission coefficient . in this case , coupling between the two leads @xmath118 has been assumed to be @xmath119 .",
    "thus , similar to what we did in subsection , we could easily derived @xmath120 . together with @xmath116",
    ", we could immediately obtain from formula that @xmath2=\\mathrm{tr}\\left(g_{cc}^{r}\\gamma_{r}g_{cc}^{a}\\gamma_{l}\\right)$ ] . here",
    ", we should remember that all the quantities inside the trace now are reduced ones .",
    "however , it is still equal to expression , in which all the quantities could be the full ones , taking trace operation and the reducing procedure for @xmath86 and @xmath77 into account . how to calculate @xmath2 $ ] and apply this efficient formula to specific applications has been stated by many authors , e.g. @xcite .",
    "now we try to derive an interface formula still based on formula . by interface",
    "we simply mean left lead and right lead has been connected directly and center junction has been removed .",
    "mathematically , we know @xmath121 and @xmath122 in this situation .",
    "consequently , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "straightforwardly , we get the transmission coefficient formula in this interface problem @xcite @xmath125= & \\mathrm{tr}\\left(g_{rr}^{r}\\tilde{\\gamma}_{r}g_{rr}^{a}\\gamma_{l}\\right).\\label{eq : interface formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to apply this formula , still we need a closed equation for @xmath126 , which could be simply obtained to be @xmath127 where the reduced retarded self - energy is given by @xmath128 .",
    "the illustrative example is a one - dimensional central ring problem , in which there is only one particle in the center junction connected with two semi - infinite spring chain leads . in this model ,",
    "the interaction between the two nearest particles inside the two leads also exists taken into account as @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the form of the total hamiltonian is the same as with @xmath130 the semi - infinite tridiagonal spring constant matrix consisting of @xmath131 along the diagonal and @xmath132 along the two off - diagonals , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the coupling strength between two leads .",
    "the on - site potential term @xmath138 is necessary in establishing the steady - state current dynamically @xcite . in this simple case",
    ", there is an analytical expression for @xmath139,\\;\\alpha = l , r$ ] , which is @xmath140 , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and the choice between the plus or minus sign depends on satisfying @xmath143 . and @xmath144={1}/{\\omega}$ ] .",
    "after all these preparations , the transmission coefficient is simply calculated by the formula .",
    "also , there is an alternative method to deal with this problem suggested by di ventra as we mentioned in .",
    "essentially we repartition the total hamiltonian so that interaction between leads is absent .",
    "thus , in this model , the form of the total hamiltonian is still the same as but with @xmath145 since now @xmath146 , we can use either the caroli formula or the general one to calculate the transmission coefficient .",
    "the results of the two methods were compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : central ring ] .",
    "it turns out to be that they are the same , which justifies the suggestion of di ventra from negf point of view in this example .",
    "$ ] as a function of frequency for coupling between leads ( a ) @xmath147 , ( b ) @xmath148 , ( c ) @xmath149 , ( d ) @xmath150 .",
    "the results was calculated directly ( red solid line ) , and by repartitioning the total hamiltonian ( blue circles ) .",
    "@xmath151 in all cases .",
    "[ fig : central ring ] ]    probably a much efficient way to calculate the transmission coefficient in this type of noninteracting problem is to use the interface formula .",
    "frequently , the surface green s functions will become complex when we separate the total system into two parts in order to apply the interface formula . however , there are some efficient algorithms for surface green s functions see , for example , ref .",
    "now we will show a specific application of interface formula .",
    "here in this section we derive an explicit expression for the transmission function @xmath152 $ ] using eq .   for the single interface setup , i.e. the left and right lead",
    "are directly connected and the center part is removed .",
    "let us consider that the normalized force constant for left and the right leads are @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively and the normalized interface coupling strength is @xmath155 .",
    "also , onsite potential @xmath138 to all the atoms exists to ensure that the steady state could be established dynamically .",
    "this is a quite general scenario for a one - dimensional harmonic chain which is useful for the study of interface effects .",
    "so one of the force constant matrix say @xmath156 is equal to @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the semi - infinite matrix with only first element is nonzero @xmath159 while @xmath160 is the same as defined in the last application .",
    "similarly for @xmath161 with @xmath153 replaced by @xmath154 . in order to obtain the explicit form , only inputs that are required are retarded surface green s function @xmath162 for both the leads .",
    "@xmath163 in eq .   can then be easily obtained from these expressions .",
    "let us calculate the surface green s function for one of the leads , say the left lead .",
    "then for the right lead it can be obtained just by replacing @xmath153 with @xmath154 . the surface green s function for a semi - infinite lead when all force constants are the same is given as before , i.e. @xmath164 .",
    "now for this interface case we can obtain the surface green s function as follows . the retarded green s function for the left lead",
    "satisfies the following equation @xmath165g_{l}^{r}=i.\\ ] ] taking @xmath166 into account , and using @xmath158 as a perturbation we can write @xmath167 since in this case only first atom of the left lead is connected with the first atom of the right lead , the retarded surface green s function of the left lead is just the @xmath168 element of @xmath169 and we obtain @xmath170 and the self - energy for the lead is given by @xmath171 knowing this surface green s function and self - energy , we can easily obtain @xmath172 $ ] from eq .   which can be written as @xmath173= -\\frac{\\omega_{1}^{2 } \\omega_{2}^{2 } \\omega_{12}^{4 } ( \\lambda_1-\\lambda_1^{*})(\\lambda_2-\\lambda_2^{*})}{\\big|(\\omega_{1}^{2}-\\omega_{12}^{2}-\\omega_{1}^{2}/\\lambda_1)(\\omega_{2}^{2}-\\omega_{12}^{2}-\\omega_{2}^{2}/\\lambda_2)-\\omega_{12}^{4}\\big|^{2}},\\ ] ] where",

    "it has been noted that it matches exactly with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this expression is obtained from wave - scattering method .",
    "now if @xmath178 then we have perfect transmission i.e. , @xmath172=1 $ ] for @xmath179 within the phonon band @xmath180 and @xmath119 outside this region .",
    "we examine the heat current in a lead - junction - lead quantum system , in which coupling between the leads has been taken into account . after assuming ideal steady state",
    "could be established from initial product state , we rigorously derived a general landauer - like formula in the negf framework , from which the corresponding transmission coefficient was obtained .",
    "based on this general transmission coefficient formula , caroli formula was recovered and a computationally efficient interface formula applicable to the case in which the total noninteracting hamiltonian could be repartitioned was derived .",
    "also an illustrative example was given as both a verification of the validity of the repartitioning procedure which does nt affect the steady current value and the clarification of the meaning of some quantities used in the formula such as @xmath181 etc in different situations . finally , we derived an explicit transmission coefficient formula in a quite general one - dimensional interface situation based on interface formula , which turned out to be perfectly consistent with result obtained by wave - scattering method .",

    "<S> we present a generalized transmission coefficient formula for the lead - junction - lead system , in which interaction between the leads has been taken into account . based on it the caroli formula </S>",
    "<S> could be easily recovered and a transmission coefficient formula for interface problem in the ballistic system can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of validity for the formula is carefully explored . </S>",
    "<S> we mainly focus on heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding electrical transport could be similarly dealt with . </S>",
    "<S> also , an illustrative example is given to clarify the precise meaning of the quantities used in the formula , such as the concept of the reduced interacting matrix in different situations . in addition , an explicit transmission coefficient formula for a general one - dimensional interface setup is obtained based on the derived interface formula . </S>"
