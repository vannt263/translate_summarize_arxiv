    "since superconductivity ( sc ) was found by onnes @xcite , researchers have made a lot of efforts to figure out its mechanism .",
    "the bcs theory @xcite pointed out two electrons with opposite spins can pair with each other via electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) .",
    "therefore , magnetism or spin fluctuation ( sf ) may break the pair and be harmful to sc .",
    "the discovery of unconventional superconductors such as cuprate oxide superconductors @xcite , iron based superconductors @xcite , sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3@xcite , na@xmath4coo@xmath2@xmath5@xmath6h@xmath2o @xcite , etc . , challenges the epc mechanism . for the unconventional superconductors , sf may play an important role in the superconducting mechanism , which makes researchers reconsider the relation between magnetism and sc .",
    "superconducting mgcni@xmath1 @xcite , containing a high concentration of magnetic element ni , attracted a lot of attentions on the role of sf .",
    "mgcni@xmath1 has a so - called antiperovskite structure , in which mg atom locates at the corner , and six ni atoms at the face - center together with one c atom at the body center form the c - ni@xmath7 octahedron .",
    "a van hove singularity locates just below fermi level ( @xmath8 ) , leading to large density of states ( dos ) at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "it makes the compound strongly exchange - enhanced and unstable toward to ferromagnetism ( fm ) upon hole doping @xcite . experimentally speaking , due to the high volatility of mg and the relatively poor reactivity of c , it is extremely difficult to synthesize stoichiometric mgcni@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the atomic deficiencies in the antiperovskite system may strongly affect the properties @xcite and lead to some contradictory results in the reported polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "recently , the single crystal samples have been prepared @xcite .",
    "the physical property measurements demonstrate the conventional epc mechanism , but the reported epc strengths of these samples are contradicted @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has not been successful so far to induce fm instability by preparing hole - doped compounds such as mg@xmath10na@xmath4cni@xmath1 and mg@xmath10li@xmath4cni@xmath1 .",
    "the interplay between sc and sf in mgcni@xmath11 is still unclear and in debate @xcite .",
    "nowadays , lots of @xmath0 transition - metal based antiperovskite axm@xmath1 ( a usually is main group element ; x = b , c , and n ; m = @xmath0 transition - metal elements ) have been experimentally synthesized @xcite .",
    "however , the reported physical property measurements are mainly focused on the ni- and mn - based antiperovskites . in ni - based antiperovskites , cdcni@xmath1 and znnni@xmath1",
    "were reported to show sc behavior @xcite .",
    "abundant magnetism appears in mn - based antiperovskites ( see recent review article ref . ) .",
    "moreover , superconducting trace has been found in inbsc@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "some theoretical predictions suggest that sc may exist in some sc - based and cr - based antiperovskites @xcite .",
    "indeed , due to the high concentration of @xmath0 transition - metal atoms , one can imagine that more interesting properties exist in other antiperovskite axm@xmath1 .",
    "the investigation of them will be very important , both in the search for new superconductors and in the pursuit of a better understanding of the interplay between sc and magnetism @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we offer an approach to explore new @xmath0 transition - metal based antiperovskite superconductors . in order to have an overall understanding of the magnetism in axm@xmath1 , we calculated the electronic structures of a series of @xmath0 transition - metal based antiperovskites axm@xmath1 and concluded the doping effects of each atom . from the analysis of these doping effects",
    ", we can evaluate the variation of @xmath9 of different axm@xmath1 .",
    "we drew a magnetic phase diagram of acm@xmath1 based on the stoner criterion @xmath12 . from the phase diagram , we predict that the materials locating near fm boundary may have sizeable epc and could show sc . to confirm this deduction , we systematically investigated the formation energies , electronic structures , lattice dynamic properties , and epc of a series of cr - based axcr@xmath1 . for comparison ,",
    "such properties of mgcni@xmath1 are also calculated .",
    "our results confirm the strong epc for mgcni@xmath1 and suggest that alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 are moderate coupling bcs superconductors .",
    "the depairing effects from sf are aslo discussed .",
    "furthermore , some potential superconducting antiperovskites such as new co- and fe - based superconductors are suggested .",
    "the structural relaxation and electronic structure calculations were performed using projected augmented - wave ( paw ) @xcite method as implemented in the abinit code @xcite .",
    "electronic wavefunctions are expanded with plane waves up to an energy cutoff ( @xmath13 ) of 1200 ev .",
    "brillouin zone sampling is performed on a monkhorst - pack ( mp ) mesh @xcite of @xmath14 the self - consistent calculations were considered to be converged when the total energy of the system was stable within @xmath15 ha . non - magnetic ( nm ) and fm states were tested in the study .",
    "the calculations of phonon spectra and epc were based on the frame work of the self consistent density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) @xcite using planewaves and ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite with quantum - espresso @xcite .",
    "we use an @xmath16 grid for zone integration in the self - consistent calculations , while a denser @xmath17 grid was used in the epc calculations .",
    "we have calculated dynamical matrices at a uniform @xmath18 grid of @xmath19-points .    to ensure our calculation reliability , we cross - checked the results given by the above two dft codes and found them to be in close agreement . and for consistency , we used the same gga - pbe @xcite exchange - correlation potential in both cases .",
    "as rosner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite mentioned , the a - site atom only plays the role as an effective valent electrons supplier .",
    "the most common a - site atoms of the antiperoveskite compounds can be divided into four groups according to the effective valence electrons : cu and ag ( a@xmath20 ) ; mg , zn , and cd ( a@xmath21 ) ; al , ga , and in ( a@xmath22 ) ; ge and sn ( a@xmath23 ) . clearly , the effective valence electrons of a - site atoms are usually in the range from 1 to 4 . for simplification , we chose na@xmath20 , mg@xmath21 , al@xmath22 , and si@xmath23 atoms as the a - site atoms of the antiperovskites we investigated .",

    "figure [ fig - lattice - moment ] shows the lattice parameters and magnetic moment of a series of carbon - based acm@xmath1 .",
    "as expected , the lattice parameter varies with the same trend of variation of the atom radius .",
    "the ground states of these compounds are determined by comparing the total energies of the nm and fm states .",
    "the acmn@xmath1 and most acfe@xmath1 show fm state , which coincides with the experimental results .",
    "surprisingly , sicfe@xmath1 and alcco@xmath1 show nm state . comparing the magnetic moments with the @xmath9 ( table [ table - acm3-n(ef ) ] )",
    ", one can see that all the compounds with fm ground state have quite large @xmath9 in nm state .",
    "it is corresponding to the stoner s itinerant magnetism : the higher @xmath9 in nm state , the easier a system becomes spin - polarized .",
    "the magnetism of these compounds will be discussed below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 , the absence of imaginary frequency suggests the dynamic stability of the considered crystal structures of the three compounds .",
    "the acoustic modes are harder than those of mgcni@xmath1 , and no modes are close to instability .",
    "the optical phonons at @xmath24 point belong to the following irreducible representations : @xmath25 ( see figure [ fig - mode ] ) , which are infrared ( ir ) active ( table [ table - mode ] ) .",
    "the c / n related @xmath26 mode and @xmath27 mode of znncr@xmath1 are softer than those of alccr@xmath1 and gaccr@xmath1 maybe due to the larger atomic mass of nitrogen .",
    "we did not observe the significant softening of @xmath28 mode that reported by ttnc _",
    "_ in rhncr@xmath1 and gancr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the calculated eliashberg functions @xmath29 of mgcni@xmath1 , alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 are plotted in figure [ fig - a2f ] according to the below formula : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are phonon frequencies , @xmath32 electronic energies , and @xmath33 @xmath34 matrix elements .",
    "the total epc strength is @xmath35 the calculated @xmath36 are visualized as red circles in figure [ fig - phonon ] . for mgcni@xmath1",
    ", the absence of imaginary frequency allows the direct calculation of the quantitative epc contribution details from the lowest acoustic mode .",
    "obviously for mgcni@xmath1 the epc originates mainly from acoustic phonon modes softening . for alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1",
    ", optical modes are playing an important role .",
    "the epc distributes throughout some low - frequency phonon modes .",
    "one can note that a larger @xmath36 always exists at the frequencies at which large cr - phonon dos present . at the zone center",
    ", the @xmath26 and @xmath28 modes mainly contribute to epc .",
    "for the two modes , cr atoms vibrate strongly against each other ( figure [ fig - mode ] ) .",
    "such vibrations can make large change in the overlap of @xmath0 orbitals between neighbouring cr atoms , leading to strong coupling . comparing the epc strength from different phonon modes of gaccr@xmath1 and znncr@xmath1",
    ", it can be found that the softening of @xmath26 mode can strongly enhance @xmath37 .",
    "eliashberg functions ( left ) and frequency - dependent epc strength @xmath37 ( right ) of ( a ) mgcni@xmath1 , ( b ) alccr@xmath1 , ( c ) gaccr@xmath1 , and ( d ) znncr@xmath1 . ]",
    "the integrated epc strengths @xmath38 are calculated using equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , and are plotted in figure [ fig - a2f ] .",
    "the epc comes mainly from the @xmath29 peaks at low frequencies , which are mostly related to the vibrations of ni / cr atoms . for the peaks at high frequencies related to the vibrations of c / n atoms , their contributions to @xmath37 are less than 6% .",
    "the calculated @xmath37 of mgcni@xmath1 is 1.34 , implying very strong epc .",
    "however , the calculated @xmath37 of alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 are less than 1.0 and about @xmath39 ( table [ table - mode ] ) , implying moderate epc .",
    "the difference of @xmath37 for axcr@xmath1 can be described qualitatively using hopfield expression @xmath40 where @xmath41 is mean square epc matrix element averaged over fermi surface , @xmath42 is the ion mass , and @xmath43 is the average squared phonon frequency . the higher @xmath9 and the lower phonon frequency make gaccr@xmath1 has the larger @xmath37 .    ( a ) variation of @xmath44 with @xmath45(purely static pair breaking ) ; ( b ) variation of @xmath44 with @xmath46 ( electron - paramagnon coupling ) . ]    to calculate @xmath44 , we used the allen - dynes equation @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath45 is coulomb pseudopotential and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 at the absence of sf , using a typical @xmath50 , we can get @xmath44 with the values of 11.82 , 6.67 , 11.29 , and 8.23 k for mgcni@xmath1 , alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 , respectively . according to the experimental results of mgcni@xmath1 single crystals",
    "@xcite , the observed @xmath44 is around 7 k. it seems that our calculation overestimates @xmath44 of mgcni@xmath1 .",
    "therefore we need to consider the influence of sf in the system .",
    "we firstly considered the purely static pair breaking due to sf by varying @xmath45 . in figure [ fig - tc ] ( a ) , one can note that the increasing @xmath45 significantly depresses @xmath44 . as @xmath44 around 7 k , we can get @xmath51 .",
    "such a value is smaller than the previous derivations of @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53 @xcite , but still larger than the typical values @xmath54 for the absence of sf .",
    "it is better to discuss the influence of sf in terms of electron - paramagnon coupling strength @xmath46 @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the effective coupling strength should be @xmath55 .",
    "the effective mass of the carriers should be enhanced by the factor @xmath56 . and equation ( [ eq : tc ] ) shound be changed as @xcite @xmath57 figure [ fig - tc ] ( b ) shows the calculated @xmath44 using equation ( [ eq : tc - sf ] ) with different @xmath46 ( here the coulomb pseudopotential is fixed to the typical value @xmath50 ) .",
    "when @xmath44 is around 7 k , we can get @xmath58 .",
    "although the obtained parameter is small , it still implies that sc in the system is partially suppressed by depairing effect from sf @xcite .",
    "the influence of sf on @xmath44 of alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 is also present in figure [ fig - tc ] .",
    "if we consider the same sf influence as in mgcni@xmath1 , using equation ( [ eq : tc ] ) with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we can get @xmath61 , 3.11 , and 1.40 k for alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 , respectively ; using equation ( [ eq : tc - sf ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath62 , we can get @xmath63 , 3.52 , and 1.69 k for alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "let us look back at the electronic structures of alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath8 locates between two dos peaks , which suggests in the system both hole and electron doping can enhance the sf and lead to a transition from sc to magnetic instability .",
    "considering it has not been successful so far to investigate such transition in doped antiperovskites such as mg@xmath10(a@xmath20)@xmath4cni@xmath1 due to the difficulty in experimental preparation of samples , axcr@xmath1 may be good candidates to figure out the relation between sc and magnetism in antiperovskites .",
    "since the discovery of sc in mgcni@xmath1 , researchers have made great efforts to explore other @xmath0 transition - metal based antipervoskite superconductor @xcite .",
    "the observed superconducting trace at 4.5 k found in in@xmath64b@xmath65sc@xmath1 is encouraging @xcite .",
    "theoretically , inbsc@xmath1 is close to weak fm and with an epc superconducting mechanism @xcite .",
    "one should believe the ni - based antiperovskite superconductor are not alone and other superconducting antiperovskites may be hidden behind them .     of ( a ) sicfe@xmath1 and ( b ) alcco@xmath1 .",
    "]    indeed , our magnetic phase diagram shows that some axsc@xmath1 should be very close to fm , which may potentially be superconducting .",
    "there are also some other antiperovskite compounds close to fm , such as axv@xmath1 , for which the cubic phase has not been successfully prepared so far . here",
    "we present two potential superconducting parent materials a@xmath23cfe@xmath1 ( a = si , ge , etc . ) and a@xmath22cco@xmath1 ( a = al , ga , etc . ) .",
    "the dos near @xmath8 of sicfe@xmath1 and alcco@xmath1 are plotted in figure [ fig - acfeco ] .",
    "one can notice that the @xmath8 of the two compounds just locates at a dos valley .",
    "thus both electron and hole doping can move @xmath8 to the dos peaks nearby , and largely enhance @xmath9 to yield strong epc . therefore , doped a@xmath22cco@xmath1 may be new co - based superconductors besides na@xmath4coo@xmath2@xmath5@xmath6h@xmath2o @xcite . and doped a@xmath23cfe@xmath1 may be new fe - based superconductors .",
    "as we know , the role of epc in the fe - based superconductors is still puzzling .",
    "for instance , epc mechanism can get a reasonable @xmath44 of the hcp iron under pressure , but can not explain the rapid disappearance of sc above 30 gpa @xcite . for the iron pnictide superconductors @xcite , boeri _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and mazin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that the epc in the system is intrinsically weak , but can be enhanced strongly by magnetism @xcite .",
    "although epc is still not enough to explain the high critical temperature , it is strong enough to have a non - negligible effect on sc . on the other hand , in the similar system of nickel pnictide superconductors",
    ", it seems the epc plays the main role @xcite .",
    "one may connect nickel pnictide superconductors with mgcni@xmath1 by the similar epc mechanism .",
    "the potential supeconductivity in doped a@xmath23cfe@xmath1 may also help to figure out the superconducting mechanism , which needs to be futher confirmed in experimental and theoretical works .",
    "in this work , we theoretically investigated the electronic structure , magnetic properties , and lattice dynamics of the @xmath0 transition - metal based antiperovskite compounds axm@xmath1 .",
    "based on the analysis of the doping effect in axm@xmath1 , we drew the magnetic phase diagram of acm@xmath1 .",
    "we suggested that superconducting antiperovskites can be found in the nm area but very close to fm boundary . in order to prove the deduction , we investigated a series of cr - based antiperovskite axcr@xmath1 ( x = c , n ) .",
    "the results indicate that alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 are of nm ground state but very close to fm instability . due to the large @xmath9",
    ", these compounds have sizeable epc .",
    "we calculated the phonon spectra and epc of mgcni@xmath1 , alccr@xmath1 , gaccr@xmath1 , and znncr@xmath1 .",

    "such compounds may be good candidates to figure out the role of sf . moreover , some potential new antiperovskite co - based and fe - based superconductors are suggested .",
    "up to date , there is no definite evidence of sf in mgcni@xmath1 single crystals @xcite . since",
    "such single crystals are not stoichiometric , the interplay between sc and magnetism are still puzzling .",
    "our phase diagram and predictions could offer new route to figure out the issue . in experiments",
