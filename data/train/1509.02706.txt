    "bl lac objects , together with flat - spectrum radio quasars , form the  blazar \" class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . their observed properties , such as strong variability at all frequencies , high and variable polarization , apparent superluminal motion of the radio components , are explained as due to beamed emission from a relativistic jet closely aligned with the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these objects shows two bumps : the low - frequency one ( from radio to optical / x - rays ) is ascribed to synchrotron emission , while the bump at high energies ( x - rays to @xmath0-rays ) is likely produced by inverse - compton scattering of soft photons off the same relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron radiation @xcite .",

    "the log - parabolic fit of the x - ray spectrum gave a synchrotron peak energy of about 0.50.7 kev , i.e.  more than 10 times higher than we found by fitting the sed over a broader energy range .",
    "physical explanations of the x - ray spectral curvature observed in bl lac objects were given by @xcite by assuming that the probability for a particle to increase its energy is a decreasing function of the energy itself , and by @xcite as due to episodic particle acceleration .",

    "one may wonder whether the choice of galactic extinction can play a role .",
    "we followed @xcite ; had we used the recalibration by @xcite , which implies a @xmath76 lower extinction values , we would have obtained a small shift of the optical  uv seds downward , by @xmath81 in the @xmath11 band , up to @xmath82 in the @xmath832 band .",

    "incidentally , we notice that similar connection problems were found for other bl lac objects , both lbl such as bl lacertae itself @xcite and hbl such as mkn 421 @xcite and h 1722 + 119 ( ahnen et al .  2015 , in preparation ) .",

    "the high state is obtained with @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the intermediate state with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and the low state with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . as for the other parameters introduced above",
    ", we fixed @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 at jet apex ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "we selected the model parameters in particular to obtain i ) an x - ray spectrum with the same curvature as that derived from the _ xmm - newton _ data , but ii ) a uv spectral shape more similar to that given by the _",
    "swift_-uvot data , iii ) an inflection point in the sed of the low x - ray state that can reproduce the narrow synchrotron peak marked by the _ swift_-uvot and _ hst_-cos data , and iv ) sufficient flux in the radio band to fit the radio observations at 43 ghz performed close to the _ xmm - newton _ pointing of 2013 july 2425 . while we refer to (",
    "* and to the other papers mentioned at the beginning of this section ) for a full mathematical description of the helical jet model , we show in fig .",
    "[ andamenti ] the trends of some physical and geometrical quantities with the distance @xmath86 along the helix axis .",
    "in the top panel one can see that the maximum and minimum emitted frequencies decrease along the jet , while the emissivity first rapidly increases and then slowly decreases and @xmath115 decrease along the jet ( see eqs .  4 and 5 in @xcite )",
    "are defined by : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "the trend of emissivity has been slightly modified with respect to eq .  9 in villata & raiteri through the introduction of a further multiplicative factor @xmath119 , where @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 . ] in the bottom panel we compare the behaviour of the viewing angle @xmath98 and doppler factor @xmath123 for the three fits to the source seds presented in fig .",
    "[ sed_helssc ] .",
    "close to the jet apex , where the highest frequencies are emitted , the doppler factor is greater for the high - state fit and lower for the low x - ray state , and this is also true , with different amplitude , along all the jet .",
    "for all cases the maximum beaming occurs around @xmath1240.4 , the region from which frequencies in the range @xmath125 to @xmath126 are emitted .",
    "the peak of the doppler factor is lower in the intermediate state than in the low state , but @xmath127 is smoother than @xmath128 , and this explains why the two cases produce the same ir  optical flux .",
    "indeed , @xmath127 soon overcomes @xmath128 , in regions where ir and optical frequencies are still efficiently produced .",
    "in conclusion , the good fits to the source seds that the inhomogeneous helical jet model can produce suggest that instabilities developing inside the jet and changing the jet geometry may explain the variations of the sed shape even when the intrinsic jet emission does not change .",
    "we notice that three - dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized jets show that kink instabilities are produced , leading to jet wiggling and beam deflection off the main longitudinal axis @xcite or helical jet deformations @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that variations of the viewing angle of the jet emitting regions are likely to occur .      another possible explanation for the optical  x - ray spectral shape and its variability may be the presence of an extra contribution to the absorption , in addition to the galactic one , which would imply less steep uv spectra and softer x - ray spectra , eliminating the need for an x - ray spectral curvature .",
    "this is questioned by the _ xmm - newton _ data , which already present too high uv fluxes and for which the fit of the epic spectrum with a power - law model with @xmath129 free is statistically worse than the fits with curved models .",
    "an alternative picture is that there are multiple ( at least two ) emission components , so that the optical  uv and x - ray emissions have a different origin .",
    "this would also explain in particular why the pg 1553 + 113 x - ray flux varies by about a factor of 4 while the optical  uv level does not change , as can be derived when comparing the state of the source in 2009 september ",
    "october with that during the second _ magic _ pointing ( see fig .",
    "[ sed_altri ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons in the source , @xmath130 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the electrons , has a more complex shape than the usually assumed power - law or log - parabolic one .    to distinguish among the various interpretations , we need more high - quality simultaneous observations in the optical  uv and x - rays , covering different brightness states of the source",
    "this would allow us to better understand the correlation between the emission in the two bands .",
    "we have presented multiwavelength data acquired during the webt campaign organized in 2013 to study the blazar pg 1553 + 113 during _ magic _ very high energy observations .",
    "we have complemented the radio - to - optical data from the webt with uv and x - ray observations by _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ to analyse the synchrotron emission in detail .",
    "a forthcoming paper will address the higher - energy emission and in particular the results obtained by _ magic _ and _ fermi _ ( ahnen et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "the source revealed an enigmatic synchrotron behaviour , the connection between the uv and x - ray spectra in the sed appearing more complex than usually assumed . while _",
    "swift_-xrt observations have too low statistic to derive detailed information on the x - ray spectral shape , the long exposure by _ xmm - newton _ in july 2013 confirms that the x - ray spectrum is curved , but probably not as curved as a log - parabolic fit would imply . on the other side , _ swift_-uvot as well as _ hst_-cos and _ iue _ data show a steep uv spectrum that hardly connects to the x - ray one .    among the possible interpretations , we have investigated a scenario where",
    "the observed flux variations are due to changes of the viewing angle of the emitting regions in a helical jet , while the intrinsic flux remains constant .",
    "we have obtained good fits to the seds built with contemporaneous data in different brightness states by varying only three parameters defining the jet orientation .",
    "we are not claiming that all the source variability is due to geometrical effects , but our analysis reveals how important orientation effects are in these beamed sources .",
    "we finally note that a periodicity of @xmath131 d has recently been found when analysing the @xmath0-ray data of pg 1553 + 113 @xcite .",
    "the helical jet model can in principle explain periodicities by assuming that the helix rotates because of the orbital motion in a binary black hole system @xcite .",
    "however , a reproduction of both the sed and multiwavelength flux variations requires good data sampling and a fine - tuning of the model parameters .",
    "a further observing effort needs to be spent to fully understand the emission variability mechanisms of this object .",
