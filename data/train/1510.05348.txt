    "in recent decades , the investigation of remarkable colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) phenomena in manganites has been one of important research areas in condensed matter physics @xcite . in one word ,",
    "the cmr effect occurs when the ground state changes from insulating to ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic phases by the application of a small magnetic field @xcite . among the two phases ,",
    "the appearance of the fm metallic phase has been usually rationalized by the so - called double - exchange mechanism @xcite on the basis of a strong hund coupling between itinerant @xmath3 electrons and localized @xmath2 spins . on the other hand , the insulating phase is basically understood by the coupling between degenerate @xmath3 electrons and jahn - teller distortions of the mno@xmath4 octahedra , leading to the various types of charge and/or orbital orders @xcite .    from the viewpoint of industrial application",
    ", manganites have been focused as important materials for the magnetic head of high - density hard disk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some manganites have been used as cathodes in li - ion batteries and catalysts .",
    "in fact , as for the cathodes , limn@xmath5o@xmath6 with spinel structure has been used for electric vehicles @xcite and , limno@xmath5 and their other transition metals - substituted materials with layered structure are expected to be promising cathode materials @xcite . on the other hand , concerning the catalysts , much attention has been paid to camn@xmath6o@xmath7 cluster in photosystem @xcite . in artificial photosynthesis",
    ", mno@xmath5 has been investigated as a catalyst @xcite , instead of camn@xmath6o@xmath7 cluster from the viewpoint of the difficulty in synthesis .    in previous research on manganites , the spin - charge - orbital ordering in the bulk @xcite and the interface in the heterostructures",
    "@xcite have been discussed . however , for the application to cathodes and catalysts , it is important to consider explicitly _ surface _ electronic states .",
    "it is well known that manganites work as cathodes and catalysts when the valence changes mainly from mn@xmath1 to mn@xmath0 in the process of chemical reaction .",
    "thus , we focus on the valence change from mn@xmath1 to mn@xmath0 here . to achieve high efficiency as cathodes and catalysts , it is desirable to obtain the situation with mn@xmath1 ions on the surface and mn@xmath0 in the bulk .",
    "although such a situation is naively expected to occur in metallic materials , it is still unclear what microscopic mechanisms cause such valence imbalance of manganese ions between surface and bulk .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of surface on the electronic state in layered manganites on the basis of an orbital - degenerate double - exchange model with surfaces . for two kinds of @xmath2 spin structures ,",
    "we find that the number of mn@xmath1 ions on the surface is always larger than that in the bulk , which is understood by the surface - induced friedel oscillation .",
    "in particular , for the sheet - like antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase , we observe a peculiar beat phenomenon , explained by the interference among friedel oscillations . in this case , the number of mn@xmath1 ions more increases on the surface .",
    "we believe that the present results contribute to the development of high - efficient cathodes and catalysts . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use such units as @xmath8=@xmath9=@xmath10 .",
    "to approach the present problem , we introduce an orbital degenerate double - exchange model . to simplify the model ,",
    "we adopt the widely - used approximation with infinite hund coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath2 electron spins . in such a limit",
    ", the @xmath3 electron spin perfectly aligns along the @xmath2 spin direction , leading to the suppression of spin degrees of freedom of @xmath3 electrons .",
    "namely , @xmath3 electrons move only in the fm region of @xmath2 spins , while in the af region , @xmath3 electrons are localized .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the annihilation operator for a spinless @xmath3 electron in the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) orbitals at site @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the vector connecting nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is ising - like @xmath2 spin at site @xmath16 with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude between @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals along the @xmath17 direction with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter we set the energy unit as @xmath27 . in the second term",
    ", @xmath28 is the af coupling between nearest - neighbor @xmath2 spins and @xmath29 denotes the nearest - neighbor site pair . in this paper",
    ", we do not include explicitly the coulomb interaction terms , but the effect is partially considered by working with a large hund coupling .",
    "namely , we consider the manganite with large bandwidth . we define @xmath30 as @xmath3 electron number per site ,",
    "while @xmath31 is the hole doping with the relation of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 indicates the average number of mn@xmath1 ions per site .    in this work ,",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized in a @xmath33 lattice : one layer is composed of @xmath34 square lattice with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) along the x- and y - axes . to introduce the surfaces in the model",
    ", we consider the stack of @xmath35 layers with open boundary condition ( obc ) along the z - axis . in this paper , we introduce the obc in the sense of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the wavefunction of spinless @xmath3 electron along the z - axis and @xmath38 is a layer number .",
    "namely , the first layer along the z - axis indicates the surface , whereas the @xmath39-th layer denotes the bulk . in most cases ,",
    "the cluster of @xmath40 is used , while in a certain case , we consider the cluster of @xmath41 .",
    "spins , respectively . to save space",
    ", we show the spin structure only in a @xmath42 lattice .",
    "( b ) @xmath43 ( red solid curve ) and @xmath44 ( black dashed line ) as functions of hole doping @xmath31 for the @xmath45 lattice in the c - af state .",
    "( c ) @xmath46 vs. @xmath38 for @xmath47 . broken horizontal line denotes the value of @xmath31 . ]    to concentrate on the effect of surface , we do not discuss the stability of the ground - state magnetic structures in this paper .",
    "rather we assume two kinds of spin structures : c - type af ( c - af ) state and a - type af ( a - af ) state , as shown in fig .",
    "at least in the @xmath42 lattice , it is easy to show that such magnetic states actually appear as the ground states for appropriate values of @xmath28 . in the c - af state",
    ", @xmath3 electron can move only along the z - axis because of the infinite hund coupling .",
    "thus , the system is regarded as a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain with the obc along the z - axis . on the other hand , in the a - af state",
    ", @xmath3 electron can move in the x - z plane , leading to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheet with edges .",
    "thus , this spin structure is called the sheet af state . due to the limitation of the page numbers ,",
    "we do not show in this paper the calculation results for the three - dimensional ferromagnetic state ( 3d fm ) , where @xmath3 electron can move in all three dimensions .    by using these lattices ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath46 , the number of mn@xmath1 ions per site of the layer @xmath38 , to clarify the effect of the dimension of the fm region in which @xmath3 electrons can move .",
    "we note that @xmath43 and @xmath48 denote the number of mn@xmath1 ions per site on the surface and in the bulk , respectively .",
    "first let us consider the charge structure in the c - af state for @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we show @xmath43 and @xmath44 as functions of @xmath31 . for @xmath49 , @xmath43 is exactly equal to @xmath44 . in 1d chain along the z - axis ,",
    "@xmath15 orbital has itinerant nature , while @xmath14 orbital becomes perfectly localized . for @xmath50 , @xmath3",
    "electrons exclusively accommodate the band composed of @xmath15 orbitals .",
    "however , for @xmath51 , @xmath3 electrons begin to accommodate the flat band composed of localized @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "thus , the difference in charge densities between surface and bulk does not appear in the region of @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , @xmath43 is clearly larger than @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath3 electrons can not gain enough kinetic energy along the z - axis at the edge , @xmath3 electron number should be reduced on the surface , leading to the increase of @xmath43 .",
    "namely , it is interpreted that a strong impurity potential exists at the edge . in such a situation",
    ", we expect the emergence of surface - induced friedel oscillation @xcite .    to confirm this expectation , we plot @xmath46 vs. @xmath38 for @xmath47 in fig .",
    "note that @xmath43 is larger than @xmath31 .",
    "we observe that @xmath46 exhibits a damped oscillation from the surface ( @xmath54 ) to the bulk ( @xmath55 ) , which is well fitted by the formula for friedel oscillation as @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fermi momentum and @xmath58 is the correlation exponent @xcite . for @xmath47 , @xmath57",
    "is given by @xmath59 , consistent with the period of the oscillation in fig .",
    "we note that @xmath60 in the present case , since we do not include coulomb interactions among @xmath3 electrons .",
    "in fact , the envelope of the oscillation is expressed by @xmath61 . note also that @xmath44 is slightly smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "the friedel oscillation occurs due to the optimal @xmath3 electron arrangement so as to maximize the energy gain of kinetic motion .",
    "however , the localized orbital does not contribute to the kinetic energy and thus , we do not find friedel oscillation in the region of @xmath52 .",
    "this is characteristic to the 1d @xmath3-electron system .",

    "( d ) fermi - surface curves of @xmath3 electron systems for @xmath62 by assuming the pbc along the z - axis",
    ". the magnitudes of nesting vectors along the z - axis are @xmath67 and @xmath65 , which are consistent with the peak positions in ( c ) . ]",
    "next we consider the results in the sheet af state for @xmath40 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , @xmath43 is larger than @xmath44 for the whole range of @xmath31 in contrast to fig .",
    "1(b ) for the c - af state . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we plot @xmath46 for @xmath62 .",
    "we again observe a friedel - like oscillation , but it is not obvious at this stage that it can be really considered as the friedel oscillation .",
    "in contrast to the c - af state , the impurity potentials in the sheet af state are regarded to array on the edge line and the oscillation is not simply expressed by eq .",
    "let us examine the oscillation from a viewpoint of the fermi - surface structure .",
    "we show the fourier transform @xmath63 of @xmath46 and the fermi - surface curves at @xmath62 in fig .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) , respectively .",
    "note that we depict the fermi - surface curves by assuming the pbc along the z - axis , since in this case , we can ignore the effect of the difference between obc and pbc . in fig .",
    "2(c ) , we find two peaks in the region of @xmath66 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , suggesting that the oscillation includes two wavevectors . by analogy with the wavevector of the friedel oscillation expressed in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we deduce that such two wavevectors are closely related with nesting vectors along the z - axis in the 2d fm region of the sheet af state .",
    "in fact , the nesting vectors are @xmath67 and @xmath65 in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) . in the sheet",
    "af state , since the average charge density per layer oscillates along the z - axis , we conclude that fig .",
    "2(b ) denotes the friedel oscillation in the 2d system .",
    "note that the envelop of the 2d friedel oscillation decays faster than @xmath61 , but the discussion on this point is postponed in a future paper .",
    "vs. @xmath31 for @xmath68 lattice in the sheet af state .",
    "the insets denote typical fermi - surface structures which characterize three regions .",
    "( b ) @xmath46 vs. @xmath38 for @xmath69 . broken horizontal line denotes the value of @xmath31 .",
    "( c ) @xmath46 vs. @xmath38 for @xmath70 .",
    "this result can be well reproduced by the superposition of ten oscillations . ]      to clarify the increase in @xmath43 in comparison with @xmath31 , we define the ratio @xmath71 as @xmath72 , which expresses the degree of the appearance tendency of mn@xmath1 ions on the surface at a certain hole doping @xmath31 . when @xmath43 is enhanced , we expect that the efficiency as cathodes and catalysts is increased .",
    "thus , @xmath71 is called the `` efficiency '' in this paper .    for further investigation of physical properties in the sheet af state",
    ", we consider the cluster of @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we plot the efficiency @xmath71 as a function of @xmath31 for the sheet af state .",
    "we find three regions classified by the topology of the fermi - surface structure , shown in the insets . in the region of @xmath73 , we find two fermi - surface curves with the centers at @xmath74 and @xmath75 points . in the regions of @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ", we find one fermi - surface curve with the center at @xmath75 and @xmath74 points , respectively . at the boundaries of these regions , we find a kink or an inflection point , which are the so - called van hove singularities .",
    "now we turn our attention to the small @xmath31 region , where the magnitude of @xmath71 is enhanced . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we plot @xmath46 at @xmath69 , in which we find a beat pattern in sharp contrast to the damped oscillation observed in fig .",
    "2(b ) . as discussed in fig .",
    "2(b ) , when two fermi - surface curves exist , @xmath46 is considered to be given by the superposition of two friedel oscillations with wavevectors corresponding to the nesting vectors along the z - axis . in the 2d fm region ,",
    "the spinless @xmath3 electron system possesses the fermi - surface structure near the perfect nesting in the vicinity of @xmath78 and such two nesting vectors along the z - axis take the similar values .",
    "thus , at a first glance , the interference between two friedel oscillations with almost the same wavevectors seems to induce a beat .",
    "however , when we carefully investigate the wavevector of the beat , we notice that it is not simply given by the difference in two nesting vectors along the z - axis near @xmath78 .",
    "rather the resolution @xmath79 in the @xmath80 space along the z - axis plays a key role for the formation of the beat in @xmath46 near @xmath78 . when we consider @xmath35 layers along the z - axis in the obc ,",
    "@xmath81 is given by @xmath82 with an integer @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , leading to @xmath85 .",
    "this relation is obtained from the condition of @xmath36 .",
    "then , we find a simple expression for @xmath46 near @xmath78 as @xmath86,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the amplitude for the oscillation with @xmath88 . for small @xmath31 ,",
    "the deviation of the shape of the fermi - surface curves from the perfect nesting structure occurs in the unit of @xmath79 and several numbers of oscillations with @xmath88 near @xmath89 ( half - filling ) contribute to @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the difference between two nesting vectors does not play an important role in @xmath46 near @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , the pattern in fig .",
    "3(b ) is well reproduced by the superposition of two oscillations of @xmath90 and @xmath91 with the same amplitudes .",
    "when we increase @xmath31 , the number of nodes in @xmath46 is increased , even though two fermi - surface curves continue to exist .",
    "for instance , we plot @xmath46 at @xmath70 in fig .",
    "3(c ) , which can not be explained by the superposition of two oscillations .",
    "however , we can reproduce fig .  3(c ) by the superposition of ten oscillations with @xmath88 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 with the same amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we find @xmath94 nodes in @xmath46 .",
    "when we define @xmath95 as the number of superposed oscillations , the number of nodes in @xmath46 is given by @xmath96 and the corresponding hole doping @xmath97 is expressed as @xmath98 .",
    "for the value of @xmath31 deviated from @xmath97 , there occurs a beat corresponding to @xmath97 near @xmath31 .    for @xmath99 ,",
    "the resolution becomes relatively smaller than the difference in two nesting vectors of the fermi - surface curves .",
    "in such a case , the beat phenomenon disappears and instead the oscillation like fig .",
    "2(b ) begins to appear .",
    "the exotic beat phenomenon can be observed only in the small @xmath31 region , where the effect of the resolution in the @xmath80 space is significant .",
    "we emphasize that the clear friedel oscillation is observed and @xmath43 is enhanced only for the fermi - surface structure with good nesting properties .",
    "in fact , when the nesting properties are lost for larger @xmath31 , we simply observe a monotonic decrease in @xmath46 from surface to bulk .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the dependence of charge densities on the layer number in the orbital degenerate double - exchange model with surfaces for c - af and sheet af states .",
    "we have found that mn@xmath1 number on the surface is larger than that in the bulk , which is basically understood from the surface - induced friedel oscillations .    concerning the future research directions on the present issue , four comments are in order .",
    "( i ) in this paper , we have considered only two kinds of @xmath2 spin patterns , c - af and sheet af states , mainly due to the limitation of the page numbers . for other @xmath2 spin patterns such as 3d fm and zigzag sheet af states , we will show the results in a separate paper in near future .",
    "( ii ) although we have simply assumed the @xmath2 spin patterns , it is highly desired to confirm the stability of those magnetic structures in the large - sized cluster with surfaces . a straightforward way is to perform the monte carlo simulations , but such calculations will be done in near future .",
    "( iii ) since we have considered the manganite with large bandwidth in this paper , we have simply ignored coulomb interaction and jahn - teller distortions .",
    "these effects will be significant in the manganite with narrow bandwidth .",
    "in particular , when we introduce the coulomb interaction between @xmath3 electrons , we are interested in the effect of the scattering of @xmath3 electrons on the friedel oscillations . concerning the jahn - teller distortions , we are also interested in the different jahn - teller distortions on the surface and in the bulk , in addition to the effect of jahn - teller distortions on the magnetic structure .",
    "note that in the @xmath42 and @xmath100 lattices , we have confirmed the appearance of a - af , c - af and fm states for appropriate values of @xmath28 , when we include the effect of jahn - teller distortions @xcite .",
    "such calculations with coulomb interaction and/or jahn - teller distortions will be performed in future . ( iv )",
    "we have investigated static properties of surface electronic states , but to consider the actual application of mangatites to cathodes and catalysts , local dynamical properties on the surface are also important .",
    "furthermore , the direction of the surface and its condition may provide significant effects on the friedel oscillations emphasized in this paper .",
    "these points are other future problems .    in summary , we have evaluated @xmath46 , the number of mn@xmath1 ions per site of the layer @xmath38 , by analyzing the orbital degenerate double - exchange model . for the c - af and the sheet af states ,",
    "we have found @xmath101 due to the surface - induced friedel oscillations . in particular , in the sheet af state , we have observed the beat phenomenon due to the interference among friedel oscillations , leading to the increase of @xmath43 .",
    "the present results provide fundamental understandings on further application of manganites such as high - efficient cathodes in li - ion batteries and catalysts .",
    "we thank k. hattori , k. kubo , and k. ueda for discussions and comments .",
    "the computation in this work has been partly done using the facilities of the supercomputer center of institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo ."
