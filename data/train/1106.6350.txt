    "<S> with the new viscous hydrodynamic + hadron cascade hybrid code vishnu , a rather precise ( @xmath0 ) extraction of the qgp shear viscosity @xmath1 from heavy - ion elliptic flow data is possible _ if _ the initial eccentricity of the collision fireball is known with @xmath2 accuracy . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> eccentricities from initial state models differ by up to 20% , leading to an @xmath3 uncertainty for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a simultaneous comparison of elliptic and triangular flow , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , puts strong constraints on initial state models and can largely eliminate the present uncertainty in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the differential elliptic flow @xmath6 for identified hadrons between rhic and lhc energies provides additional tests of the evolution model .    </S>",
    "<S> * prologue  how to measure @xmath7 : * hydrodynamics converts the initial spatial deformation of the fireball created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions into final state momentum anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> viscosity degrades the conversion efficiency @xmath8 of the fluid ; for given initial fireball ellipticity @xmath9 , the viscous suppression of the dynamically generated total momentum anisotropy @xmath10 is monotonically related to the specific shear viscosity @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the observable most directly related to @xmath10 is the total charged hadron elliptic flow @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its distribution in @xmath13 depends on the chemical composition and @xmath13-spectra of the various hadron species ; the latter evolve in the hadronic stage due to continuously increasing radial flow ( and so does @xmath6 ) , even if ( as expected at top lhc energy @xcite ) @xmath10 fully saturates in the qgp phase . </S>",
    "<S> when ( as happens at rhic energies ) @xmath10 does not reach saturation before hadronization , dissipative hadronic dynamics @xcite affects not only the distribution of @xmath10 over hadron species and @xmath13 , but even the final value of @xmath10 itself , and thus of @xmath12 from which we want to extract @xmath11 . to isolate the qgp viscosity @xmath1 we therefore need a hybrid code that couples viscous hydrodynamics of the qgp to a realistic model of the late hadronic stage , such as urqmd @xcite , that describes its dynamics microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> vishnu @xcite is such a code .    * extraction of @xmath7 from 200@xmath14gev au+au collisions at rhic : * the left panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] shows that such an approach yields a universal dependence of the ellipticity - scaled total charged hadron elliptic flow , @xmath15 , on the charged hadron multiplicity density per overlap area , @xmath16 , that depends only on @xmath1 but not on the details of the initial state model that provides @xmath9 and @xmath17 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pre - equilibrium flow and bulk viscous effects on these curves are small @xcite .    the qgp viscosity can be extracted from experimental @xmath12 data by comparing them with these universal curves . </S>",
    "<S> the right panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] show this for mc - glauber and mc - kln initial state models @xcite . in both cases the slope of the data @xcite is correctly reproduced ( not true for ideal nor viscous hydrodynamics with constant @xmath11 ) . due to the @xmath18 larger ellipticity of the mc - kln fireballs , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath19 differs between the two models . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the value of @xmath1 extracted from this comparison changes by more than a factor 2 between them . </S>",
    "<S> relative to the initial fireball ellipticity all other model uncertainties are negligible . without constraining @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , @xmath1 can not be determined to better than a factor 2 from elliptic flow data alone , irrespective of any other model improvements . taking the mc - glauber and mc - kln models to represent a reasonable range of initial ellipticities , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] gives @xmath20 for temperatures @xmath21 probed at rhic .    </S>",
    "<S> ebe-cmp-pion-proton-kaon-glauber.eps ebe-cmp-pion-proton-kaon-cgc.eps    vishnu with @xmath22 for mc - glauber and @xmath23 for mc - kln provides an excellent description of all aspects of soft ( @xmath24gev ) hadron production ( @xmath13-spectra and differential @xmath6 for all charged hadrons together as well as for individual identified species ) in 200@xmath25gev au+au collisions at all but the most peripheral collision centralities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a level of theoretical control is unprecedented .    </S>",
    "<S> * event - by - event hydrodynamics of fluctuating fireballs : * in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] we evolved a smooth averaged initial profile ( `` single - shot hydrodynamics '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this overestimates the conversion efficiency @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] shows that event - by - event ideal fluid dynamical evolution of fluctuating fireballs reduces @xmath26 by a few percent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is only @xmath27 for pions </S>",
    "<S> but larger for heavier hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> we expect it to be less in viscous hydrodynamics which dynamically dampens large initial fluctuations . a reduced conversion efficiency @xmath26 from event - by - event evolution will reduce the value of @xmath1 extracted from @xmath12 ; based on what we see in ideal fluid dynamics , the downward shift for @xmath1 will at most be of order 0.02 - 0.03 .    * predictions for spectra and flow at the lhc : * the successful comprehensive fit of spectra and elliptic flow at rhic @xcite allows for tightly constrained lhc predictions . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] shows such predictions for both pure viscous hydrodynamics vish2 + 1 @xcite and vishnu @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> inte-v2.eps    a straightforward extrapolation with fixed @xmath1 overpredicts the lhc @xmath12 values by 10 - 15% ; a slight increase of @xmath1 from 0.16 to 0.20 ( for mc - kln ) gives better agreement with the alice data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , at lhc energies @xmath4 becomes sensitive to details of the initial shear stress profile @xcite , and no firm conclusion can be drawn yet whether the qgp turns more viscous ( i.e. less strongly coupled ) at higher temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel shows that , at fixed @xmath28gev , @xmath6 increases from rhic to lhc for pions but decreases for all heavier hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity at rhic and lhc of @xmath29 for the sum of all charged hadrons thus appears accidental .    * constraining initial state models by simultaneous measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath31 : * while the ellipticities @xmath32 differ by about 20% between mc - kln and mc - glauber models , their triangularities    @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> ( which are entirely due to event - by - event fluctuations ) are almost identical @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests to use triangular flow @xmath5 ( which is almost entirely @xcite driven by @xmath33 ) to obtain a model - independent measurement of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f4 ] shows @xmath34 and @xmath35 for deformed gaussian fireballs with average eccentricities @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( with random relative angle ) taken from the fluctuating glauber ( `` mc - glauber - like '' ) and kln ( `` mc - kln - like '' ) models . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates that a given set of flow data requires shear viscosities that differ by a factor 2 to reproduce @xmath6 and but the same shear viscosities in both models to reproduce @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> a good fit by both models to @xmath6 produces dramatically different curves for @xmath36 , and _ </S>",
    "<S> vice versa_. the figure illustrates the strong discriminating power for such simultaneous studies and gives hope for a much more precise extraction of @xmath1 in the near future .    </S>",
