    "the recent advent of numerical evaluations of the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter , based on first principles , delivers the equation of state below and above the deconfinement temperature @xmath0 .",

    "we perform here such an extrapolation employing our quasi - particle model .",
    "having the equation of state at our disposal we consider the strangeness and charm excitations ( section 2 ) .",
    "then we follow the evolution of strongly interacting matter in the universe during confinement ( section 3 ) .",
    "we address also the strangeness fraction of matter after cosmic confinement and the hadron freeze - out ( section 4 ) .",
    "finally we comment briefly on charm dynamics in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( section 5 ) .",
    "our model @xcite rests on the idea that strongly correlated systems can be described in terms of quasi - particles . in fig .",

    "the quasi - particle energies are of the order of @xmath1 gev .",
    "strange excitations are similar to excitations of gluons and @xmath2 quarks . if the excitations are such massive one could argue that also charm is copiously excited . however , the interaction energy and rest mass of charm add up to such large values that charm is thermally suppressed , as expected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_eos ] also quasi - particle energies directly derived from lattice qcd evaluations @xcite are depicted .",
    "these quasi - particle measurements @xcite are performed for quite a different lattice configuration .",
    "the comparably large values at @xmath3 ( which however represent an upper limit as indicated ) have been considered in @xcite as hint to additional degrees of freedom contributing to the pressure .",
    "further dedicated measurements on the same lattices , where also the equation of state is evaluated , and in the proper momentum range @xmath4 , which is relevant for bulk thermodynamics , are needed to clarify that issue .",
    "our model is successfully applicable to describe the thermodynamics of the quark - gluon fluid at non - vanishing chemical potential @xcite .",
    "one can then extrapolate the equation of state into a large interval of chemical potentials not yet accessible to lattice evaluations .",

    "the evolution of matter in an isotropic , homogeneous and flat universe is determined by the friedmann equations and baryon conservation @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 as planck mass , @xmath9 stands for the scale factor , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the pressure , energy density and baryon density , respectively . in the early universe",

    "being aware of the need of a systematical chiral extrapolation , we tentatively employ the parametrization described in section [ qpm ] and extend to finite chemical potential @xmath15 @xcite with @xmath16 mev . adding the background of leptons and photons we arrive at the results displayed in fig .",

    "the differences of the time evolution of the scale factor are tiny for various scenarios ( middle panel ) .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that a strong supercooling with dominating vacuum energy , represented by the bag constant , could cause a mini - inflationary era . with the present equation of state such",
    "a scenario is unlikely .",
    "the bag model equation of state would deliver a large difference of baryon densities under equilibrium condition ( equal temperatures , chemical potentials and pressures ) in the confined and deconfined phases ( right panel ) .",
    "it was thought that in a departure from equilibrium at the end of the confinement transition the baryon charge is concentrated in the last islands of the deconfined matter which afterwards transforms to energetically more favorable strange matter @xcite .",

    "this explains the disappearance of anti - matter .",
    "briefly after confinement the baryon component was quite strange : about 30% of the baryons , constituting now the hard core of visible matter in the universe , were in form of @xmath23s ( lower left panel )",
    ".    it is often claimed that matter is produced in relativistic heavy - ion experiments under similar circumstances as in the early universe . while at rhic , at chemical freeze - out , a baryo - chemical potential @xmath24 mev ) is found @xcite , in the early universe , at comparable temperatures ,",

    "our finding in section [ qpm ] suggests that charm is not noticeably created by thermal excitations at physically relevant temperatures .",
    "rather , charm is created by hard processes in the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one interesting question concerns the energy loss of charm quarks . due to the semileptonic decays of @xmath27 mesons the momentum distribution of inclusive decay electrons should be modified by the energy loss .",
    "our first analysis @xcite did not evidence a signal for such an energy loss .",
    "it could be that the dead cone effect @xcite , the ter - mikaelian effect @xcite and the landau - pomeranchuk effect ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) suppress the energy loss . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the di - electrons from correlated semileptonic decays of open charm are more sensitive to energy loss effects .",
    "the recent run-4 results at rhic will shed further light on that issue .",
