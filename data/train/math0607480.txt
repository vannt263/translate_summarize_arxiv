    "for a fibration of compact manifolds @xmath0 where the fibre is a compact manifold with boundary , the cobordism of the index can be interpreted as the vanishing of the ( suspended ) family index for the boundary @xmath1 on the image of the restriction map @xmath2 this was realized analytically in @xcite in terms of cusp pseudodifferential operators , namely that any elliptic family of cusp pseudodifferential operators can be perturbed by a family of order @xmath3 to be invertible ; this is described as the universal case in @xcite . for the odd version of and in the special case of dirac operators , dai and freed in @xcite , showed that the @xmath4 ( i.e. exponentiated @xmath5 ) invariant of a self - adjoint dirac operator on an odd dimensional compact oriented manifold with boundary , with augmented atiyah - patodi - singer boundary condition , defines an element of the inverse determinant line for the boundary dirac operator . here",
    "we give a full pseudodifferential version of this , showing that the @xmath4 invariant for a suspended ( hence ` odd ' ) family of elliptic cusp pseudodifferential operators , @xmath6 trivializes the determinant bundle for the indicial family @xmath7 @xmath8 which in this case is a doubly - suspended family of elliptic pseudodifferential operators ; the relation to the dirac case is discussed in detail .",
    "this paper depends substantially on @xcite where the determinant on @xmath9 times suspended smoothing families is discussed .",
    "this determinant in the doubly suspended case is used to define the determinant bundle for any doubly - suspended elliptic family of pseudodifferential operators on a fibration ( without boundary ) . as in the unsuspended case ( see bismut and freed @xcite ) , the first chern class of the determinant bundle is the 2-form part of the chern character of the index bundle .",
    "the realization of the eta invariant for singly suspended invertible families in @xcite is extended here to the case of invertible families of suspended cusp operators . in the dirac case",
    "this is shown to reduce to the eta invariant of atiyah , patodi and singer for a self - adjoint dirac operator with augmented aps boundary condition .    in the main body of the paper the consideration of a self - adjoint dirac operator , @xmath10 is replaced by that of the suspended family , generalizing @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the suspension variable .",
    "this effectively replaces the self - adjoint fredholm operators , as a classifying space for odd k - theory , by the loop group of the small unitary group ( see @xcite , p.81 ) .",
    "one advantage of using suspended operators in this way is that the regularization techniques of @xcite can be applied to define the eta invariant as an extension of the index . in order to discuss self - adjoint ( cusp ) pseudodifferential operators using this suspension approach ,",
    "it is necessary to consider somewhat less regular ( product - type ) families , generalizing @xmath13 so we show how to extend the analysis to this larger setting .    as in @xcite",
    ", we introduce the various determinant bundles in a direct global form , as associated bundles to principal bundles ( of invertible perturbations ) instead of using the original spectral definition of quillen @xcite . in this way",

    "we review the main properties of cusp operators . in section  [ ld.0 ] , we consider a conceptually simpler situation which can be thought as an ` even ' counterpart of our result . in section  [ detb ] , we present the determinant bundle as an associated bundle to a principal bundle ; this definition is extended to family of @xmath9-suspended elliptic operators in section  [ 2n - sus ] .",
    "this allows us in section  [ totdlb ] to rederive a well - known consequence of the cobordism invariance of the index at the level of determinant bundles using the contractibility result of @xcite . in section  [ tsc.0 ] , we introduce the notion of cusp suspended @xmath15-algebra , which is used in section  [ lifting ] to lift the determinant from the boundary .",

    "next we extend this to a construction of cusp product - suspended pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold with boundary @xmath671 again , for suspended cusp operators , there is a weyl quantization map from the appropriate space of classical symbols @xmath672 which is surjective modulo cusp operators of order @xmath3 decaying rapidly in the parameters . to capture the product - suspended case consider the spaces of symbols analogous to @xmath673;\\hom(e , f ) ) \\label{fipomb2.121}\\ ] ] with the corresponding ` old ' and ` new ' boundaries .",
