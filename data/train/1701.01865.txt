    "there are many systems of particles interacting with long - range interactions in nature : self - gravitating bodies in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite , two - dimensional fluid dynamics @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , etc .",
    "considering , for simplicity , @xmath10dimensional particle systems which interact through an isotropic pair potential @xmath11 , long - range systems are usually defined as those for which [ pot ] v(r)~ , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a coupling constant .",
    "this characterization of interactions as long - range arises in equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite : in a system of @xmath5 particles in a volume @xmath14 , the average energy of a particle is , for @xmath15 , independent of the size of the system in the  usual \"",
    "thermodynamic limit @xmath16 , @xmath17 at fixed density @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath12 a different thermodynamic limit must be taken in order to recover extensivity of the thermodynamic potentials , and @xmath5 independent intensive properties of the system , as @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , the potential energy @xmath20 of a particle scales as @xmath21 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 must be scaled appropriately with @xmath5 so that @xmath20 is constant .",
    "this is usually called the mean - field thermodynamic limit ( or the vlasov limit when is is taken at fixed system size ) . using this scaling ,",
    "the total energy becomes extensive and it is possible to compute thermal equilibrium properties . for the class of systems we consider here , with attractive power law interactions at large scales in three dimensions , such a treatment has been given in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath22 they present unusual features compared to short range systems : inhomogeneous spatial distributions , inequivalence of the statistical ensembles , negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble etc ..    for the case of gravity it was understood decades ago , however , in the context of astrophysics ( through the seminal works of chandrasekhar , lynden - bell and others ) that such considerations based on equilibrium statistical mechanics are only relevant physically on time scales very long compared to those on which such systems evolve dynamically ( e.g. the formation and evolution of galaxies ) , and that the scenario of the dynamics of such systems is completely different to that of short range systems : on a timescale @xmath23 characteristic of the mean field dynamics ( and independent of @xmath5 in the mean field limit described above ) one observes the formation , under the effect of a mean field global interaction through so - called mean - field relaxation , of very slowly evolving macroscopic states ( e.g. galaxies ) which are far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "for gravity in @xmath7 dimensions , the time scale for evolution towards equilibrium was first estimated by chandrasekhar @xcite to be @xmath24 .",
    "thus as @xmath19 in the mean field limit , the system remains trapped in such states and never evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "a similar phenomenology has been established in the last years in the study of various other systems with long - range interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) : relaxation on a mean field time scale to a  quasi - stationary state \" ( qss ) followed by a relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium on a time scale which diverges with the particle number @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario has thus been proposed as a kind of paradigm for the dynamics of this class of interactions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more formally the evolution of a system of @xmath5 particles interacting through the pair potential can be described by the equation [ vlasov ] + ( , t)+=c_n , where @xmath25 is the mean phase space density function , i.e. , the density of particles at the position @xmath26 with velocity @xmath27 at time @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is called the  collision term \" . in general",
    "the latter is a functional of the @xmath30 distribution functions .",
    "the term @xmath31 $ ] is the _",
    "mean field force _ which can be written in terms of the pair potential @xmath11 as [ force - vlasov ] = -f(,,t ) _ v(|-|)dd .",
    "a mean - field dynamical description is valid if , in the mean - field ( or vlasov ) limit , we have that [ coll_limit ] _",
    "n c_n=0 in which case the dynamics is described by the vlasov equation , known as the  collisionless boltzmann equation \" in the astrophysical literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "qss are understood as stable stationary solutions of these equations , and mean - field relaxation as the evolution towards such states in the same mean - field framework ( on timescales of order @xmath23 ) .",
    "correspondingly , in any finite ( but large ) @xmath5 system , the term @xmath29 then describes the  collisional \" corrections to the mean - field dynamics .    for long - range interactions , therefore , to show that qss should exist one should analyze these collision terms , and determine firstly that they do indeed satisfy the condition ( [ coll_limit ] ) . further in order to understand their evolution away from qss at large but finite @xmath5 , and ( possibly ) towards thermal equilibrium , one needs to derive a suitable kinetic theory , which should allow one to infer the scalings of the time scale ( or scales ) characterizing such evolution as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "concerning the first step rigorous results have been obtained showing that the limit does exist in the gravitational case @xcite and for any potential with @xmath32 @xcite ( both in @xmath7 dimensions ) and provided a suitable regularization ( i.e. softening ) of the potential is imposed at small separations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however these provide only rigorous lower bounds ( @xmath33 ) to the time scales on which the vlasov dynamics is valid .",
    "they do not allow us to calculate in any practical manner the time scales for collisional relaxation , nor even to determine their parametric scalings .",
    "many attempts have been made in this direction through the construction of explicit kinetic theories @xcite but , in practice it is difficult to apply these methods to realistic systems to establish the relevant time scales , and in particular their parametric scalings .",
    "moreover , these theories do not take into account strong collisions .",
    "often ( e.g. @xcite ) it is argued , using such approaches , that the characteristic time scale for collisional relaxation has a generic scaling @xmath34 , except for the special case of homogeneous qss in one dimension .    in this paper",
    "we explore the conditions under which the limit is satisfied for the generic power law interaction .",
    "to do so we use a non - rigorous ( but well defined ) approach to the problem : we generalize the simple method initiated by chandrasekhar for the case of gravity @xcite .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the dominant contribution to the collisionality , described by the term @xmath29 , comes from _ two body collisions_. for the gravitational interaction this simple approach has turned out to account remarkably well for the observed time scales of collisional relaxation ( in numerical simulations ) .",
    "we generalize this approach to a generic power - law interaction ; and compare the results obtained to the results of numerical simulations of several such systems .",
    "several important results emerge from this analysis .",
    "firstly , it becomes evident through this approach that , in general , the characteristic time @xmath35 for collisional relaxation scales with the particle number @xmath5 and may depend on the properties of the two body potential at small distances .",
    "our results for the two body collisional relaxation lead to the conclusion that , in this respect , an important qualitative distinction can be made between the cases @xmath6 and @xmath36 : in both cases , for unsoftened potentials , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant depending on @xmath8 and the dimension of space @xmath39",
    ". however the sign of @xmath38 is positive only if @xmath6 .",
    "this means that , when the size of the core is sent to zero , the condition eq .",
    "( [ coll_limit ] ) can be satisfied only for @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of qss requires the satisfaction of this condition , and therefore such states can exist for @xmath40 only if the rate of collisionality is reduced through the introduction of a sufficiently soft core . in other words , for @xmath6 qss can be considered to occur simply because of the large distance behavior of the potential , while for @xmath9 their existence depends on the details of the short - distance behavior .",
    "this leads to what we call a _ dynamical _ ( rather than thermodynamical ) classification of the range of interactions , which has been proposed also using different analyses in @xcite .    the essential result above has already been reported in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a more detailed and more extended study of collisional relaxation in these systems , both for the analytical and numerical parts . in the analytical part we present both a new quantitative treatment of the two body relaxation including the contribution from hard collisions , and also of the case of different specified soft core regularizations . in the numerical part we present much more extensive results and detailed analysis , including notably potentials which decrease more slowly than the gravitational potential , and a full quantitative exploration of the role of softening .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a brief review on the literature of the collisional relaxation in the context of gravitational systems and detail our generalization of chandrasekhar calculation of the two body collisional relaxation rate for the pair potentials , with soft or hard regularizations at small distances .",
    "this leads us to write parametric scalings which allow us to infer our classification of the range of pair interactions . in the following section we describe the numerical simulations we use to explore the validity of our analytical results , their initial conditions and the macroscopic quantities we measure to characterize collisional relaxation . in the next section we present our numerical results , first for the previously studied case of gravity , and then for several cases with @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "we compare then quantitatively the relaxation time obtained theoretically with our simulations and , in the next section , we give numerical evidence indicating that the maximum impact parameter scales with the size of the system . in the final section",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the parametric dependence of the characteristic time @xmath23 for mean field evolution is given by that of the typical time a particle needs to cross the system , of size @xmath43 , under the mean field force : [ tau_mf ] _ dyn , where @xmath44 is the mass of each particle .",
    "the determination of the parametric dependence of the characteristic time of collisionality @xmath45  and , as expected , of relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium  is much less evident . for the case of gravity ( @xmath46 ) in three dimensions , chandrasekhar gave the first estimates in 1943 @xcite , through a calculation of a diffusion coefficient in velocity space for an infinite homogeneous self - gravitating distribution of particles .",
    "the central hypothesis , as for short - ranged systems , was to suppose that the main contribution to the collisional relaxation process arises from _ two - body encounters_. he calculated the variation of velocity of a test particle undergoing a `` collision '' with a particle of the homogeneous distribution , the global relaxation process being the cumulative effect of such `` collisions '' .",
    "as we will see in the next subsection the standard notion of _ impact parameter _ appears in the calculations .",
    "due to the assumption of an infinite homogeneous distribution and to the long - range nature of gravity , chandrasekhar had to cut - off the maximum impact parameter allowed at some scale , which he chose to be given by the typical inter - particle separation .",
    "more than twenty years after the paper of chandrasekhar , hnon @xcite did a new calculation following the hypothesis of chandrasekhar , but considering that all the particles in the system would contribute to the relaxation .",
    "there is then no need to introduce artificially an upper cutoff in the impact parameter , as it is naturally fixed by the size of the system .",
    "more recent theoretical approaches , like e.g. @xcite ( and references therein ) , have followed a more complete approach , linearizing the boltzmann equation .",
    "this approach makes possible to take into account not only local but also collective effects .",
    "this approach is , however , very cumbersome analytically and does not lead in practice to definite conclusions about the issues we address here .    on the other hand , @xmath5-body computer simulations of the relaxation problem",
    "have been performed to test the analytical predictions . in three dimensions",
    "such studies have been developed only for the case of gravitational interaction .",
    "we note , amongst others , numerical studies focusing on the cosmological aspect @xcite , others focusing on the maximum relevant impact parameter in the relaxation process @xcite .",
    "after some controversy , it seems that the appropriate maximal impact parameter is the size of the system ( rather than the inter - particle distance as postulated initially by chandrasekhar ) .",
    "the study of the relaxation in softened potentials ( see e.g. @xcite ) give more indications in this direction .",
    "this is a result we will confirm and provide new evidence for in this paper .    in the rest of this section we present our generalization of the two body collisional relaxation time for any attractive power law pair potential of the form ( [ pot ] ) , with @xmath47 and a soft or hard core regularization at @xmath48 , and any spatial dimension @xmath49 .",
    "the reasons for these restrictions on @xmath8 and @xmath39 become evident in the calculation below .",
    "these calculations give us the parametric dependence for the relaxation rate via two body collisions , @xmath50 , in a virialized system .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , if we assume that these processes are the dominant ones in the collisional dynamics , we can then write the condition for the existence of a regime in which a mean - field ( vlasov ) description of the dynamics is valid as @xcite _ dyn 0 n , [ criterion - qss ] since qss corresponds to the stationary ( and thus virialized ) states of the vlasov equation , condition ( [ criterion - qss ] ) is also a necessary one for the existence of such states .",
    "we consider two particles of equal mass @xmath44 , position vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and velocity vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "their relative position vector is denoted [ relative - vector ] = _ 1-_2 and their relative velocity @xmath55 . in their center of mass frame ,",
    "the velocities of the two particles are given by @xmath56 .",
    "thus if @xmath57 is the change in the relative velocity of the particles in the two body encounter , the changes in velocity of the two particles in the laboratory frame , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , ( which are equal to those in the cent - re of mass frame ) are @xmath60 the equations of the relative motion are those of a single particle of mass @xmath61 with position vector @xmath62 subject to the central potential .",
    "we decompose @xmath57 as = v _ e _ + v _ e _ , where @xmath63 is a unit vector defined parallel to the initial axis of motion , and @xmath64 a unit vector orthogonal to it , in the plane of the motion ( see fig . [ coll ] ) .    in the center of mass frame",
    ", the collision occurs as depicted in fig .",
    "[ coll ] , which shows the definition of the impact factor @xmath65 , and the deflection angle @xmath66 . as energy",
    "is conserved in the collision , the magnitudes of the initial and final relative velocity , @xmath67 , are equal .",
    "it follows that [ v_perp - and - v_par ] @xmath68 the angle @xmath69 can be calculated , as a function of the impact factor @xmath65 , using the classic formula @xcite [ phi - def ] ( b)=_r_min^ , where @xmath70 is the positive root of the denominator .",
    "we consider now the case of a pure decaying power law pair potential , v(r)=- [ power - law - potential ] and @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath71 the corresponding force is attractive , while @xmath72 it is repulsive . in what follows",
    "we will consider the attractive case , but we will discuss below also the repulsive case . indeed it turns out that our essential results hold in both cases .",
    "the integral leads naturally to the definition of the characteristic length scale [ b0gamma ] b_0=()^1/. considering the attractive case , eq .   may then be rewritten as [ phi2 ] ( b)=_r_min^ .",
    "changing to the variable @xmath73 , we obtain [ phi2-x ] ( b / b_0)=_0^x_max , where now @xmath74 is the positive root of the denominator .",
    "since @xmath75 , for given @xmath76 , is a function of @xmath77 only , it follows that @xmath69 is also a function of @xmath78 only .",
    "equation can be solved analytically only in a few cases , and notably for the case @xmath46 which corresponds to gravity in @xmath7 . for the general ( @xmath79 ) case ,",
    "the integral can easily be computed numerically , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 can then be calculated .",
    "figure [ ruth ] displays the results for a few chosen cases . in order to derive analytically the parametric dependences of the two body relaxation rate",
    ", it suffices , as we will see , to have analytical approximations in the two asymptotic regimes of soft ( @xmath82 ) and hard ( @xmath83 ) collisions .",
    "the corresponding expressions have been derived in a separate article @xcite by one of us ( bm ) and another collaborator . in what follows",
    "we make use of the relevant results of @xcite , where the full details of their derivations may be found .      when @xmath84 the particle trajectories are weakly perturbed , and the collision is said to be _",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , in this region , one has [ douxmoins ] ( b / b_0 ) = 2a ( ) ( b_0/ b ) ^ + ( ( b_0/b)^2 ) , where [ definition - a ] a ( ) = , with @xmath85 being the euler gamma function .",
    "as the angle of deflection @xmath86 , it follows that [ change - v - soft ] @xmath87 in appendix [ alternative - derivation ] an alternative derivation of eq .",
    "is presented .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , in this asymptotic regime , [ durplus1 ] ( b / b_0 ) = + ( ( b / b_0)^ ) , where @xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 . if @xmath95 , collisions are well defined with an asymptotic free state @xcite only if [ condition - binary ] b > b_0 , where = ^1/(1-)^. for @xmath96 , on the other hand , there is a finite time singularity , i.e. , the relative distance of the particles vanishes at a finite time .    the first term in the asymptotic expansion eq .",
    "gives the angle of deflection in the limit of arbitrarily small impact factors , and shows that it depends on @xmath8 . while for the case @xmath46 ( i.e. gravity in @xmath7 ) each particle velocity is exactly reversed in the center of mass frame ( @xmath97 ) , the general result for the deflection angle is different , and it increases to infinity as @xmath98 from below . at @xmath99",
    "each particle performs one full loop around the center of mass and escapes asymptotically in the same direction it arrived in , at @xmath100 each particle performs two full loops etc . , and as @xmath98 from below the number of such loops diverges .    for @xmath101 , as noted , there is in fact a singularity , with the particles running into one another at a finite time . to include this case in our treatment",
    "we must therefore assume that the pair potential eq .",
    "( [ power - law - potential ] ) is regularized at @xmath48 , so that there is a well defined collision for any impact factor .",
    "it follows from our analysis that this means that the asymptotic behavior below some arbitrarily small scale must be either repulsive , or , if attractive , diverging more slowly that @xmath102 . in what follows",
    "this assumption will suffice to extend our results to the range @xmath101 .",
    "following chandrasekhar we assume that thermal relaxation is induced by the randomization of particles velocity by two body collisions . in order to estimate the accumulated effect of two body collisions on a particle as it crosses the whole system",
    ", we estimate first the number of encounters per unit of time with impact parameter @xmath65 . in doing so we make the following approximations :    1 .",
    "the system is treated as a homogeneous random distribution of particles in a @xmath39 dimensional sphere of radius @xmath43 , 2 .",
    "the initial squared relative velocity of colliding particles is given by the variance of the particle velocities in the system .",
    "each particle is then assumed to perform a simple homogeneous random walk in velocity space , with zero mean change in velocity ( because the deflections due to each encounter have no preferred direction ) , and a positive mean squared velocity which we determine below . in this approximation",
    ", we assume that the particles have rectilinear trajectories .",
    "this approximation clearly breaks down in the case of hard collisions , in which the trajectory is strongly perturbed .",
    "we expect however the estimation of the number of collisions per unit of time to remain correct in this case , because encounters modify only the direction of the velocity , and not its modulus .",
    "as illustrated schematically in fig .  , we now divide the system in disks of thickness @xmath103 , and write the average number of encounters with impact parameter between @xmath65 and @xmath104 of a particle crossing this disk as n= b^d-2 db dz [ eq22 ] where @xmath105 is a numerical factor which depends on the spatial dimension @xmath39 ( e.g. @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) .",
    "multiplying eq .   by the square of eq .   with the condition , and integrating from @xmath108 to @xmath109 and from @xmath110 to @xmath111",
    ", we then estimate the average change in the velocity _ during one crossing _ of the system , for the perpendicular and parallel components of the velocity respectively , as : [ total - change - v ] = 2b_d n ( ) ^d-1 i _ , ( ) where [ i - powerlaw ] i _ , ( x_r)= _ 0^x_r dx x^d-2 _ , ( x ) where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and [ theta ] @xmath114 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] writing the expression for @xmath115 in this way allows a simple and useful comparison with the case of particles interacting by an exact repulsive hard core potential .",
    "indeed it is straightforward to show ( see e.g. @xcite ) that for ( infinitely ) hard particles with a diameter @xmath116 , one has [ deflection - hardcore ] ( b ) = \\ {    ll 2 ( ) & b + 0 &    . calculating @xmath115 for this case using exactly the same approach used above , one obtains , for the case @xmath117 , exactly eq .   with @xmath118",
    "let us return now to the expressions eq .   for the case of ( attractive ) power law interactions .",
    "given that @xmath119 we can make the approximation [ int - divided ] i _ , ( x_r ) & & _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^d-2 _ , ( x ) + & + & _ 1^x_r dx x^d-2 _ , ( x ) .    the first integral gives the contribution due to hard collisions ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "it is finite provided only that the deflection angle is well defined , i.e. , provided only that the two body collisions is well defined . as we have discussed above this",
    "is true for any @xmath121 , and for @xmath122 if we assume the singularity at @xmath48 to be appropriately regularized .",
    "thus this term gives a contribution to @xmath115 which has precisely the parametric dependences of an exact repulsive hard core , differing only by an overall numerical factor .",
    "considering now the second term , giving the contribution from soft collisions ( @xmath123 ) , we see that there are two different cases according to the large @xmath124 behavior of @xmath125 : the integral is convergent as @xmath126 if and only if @xmath127 as @xmath128 .",
    "we thus infer from eqs .",
    "( [ change - v - soft ] ) the following :    * for @xmath129 , [ i - vlr ] i _ ( x_r ) & & 4a^2 ( ) _ 0^x_r dx x^d-2 - 2 + & = & a^2 ( ) x_r^d-1 - 2 and @xmath130 .",
    "thus the integral is dominated by the contribution of soft scatterings , for which the change in the relative velocity is predominantly orthogonal to the initial relative velocity .",
    "replacing eq .   in eq .",
    ", we obtain the scaling [ scaling - slr ] ~n()^2 . where = + . * for @xmath131 , which corresponds to gravity in @xmath7 , the contribution from all impact factors from the scale @xmath132 must be included and _ ( x_r ) 4a^2 ( ) x_r . as in the previous case , @xmath130 .",
    "note that , given @xmath119 this result for @xmath133 is very insensitive to precisely where the lower cut - off at @xmath134 is chosen .",
    "we obtain therefore [ scaling - grav - like ] ~n()^d-1 ( ) . * for @xmath135",
    ", we have _ , ( x_r ) _ , ( ) _ 0^ dx x^d-2 _ , ( x ) which is a constant that can be numerically calculated in a straightforward way for any given pair potential in this class .",
    "we obtain therefore [ scaling - mlr ] ~n()^d-1 .    in the last case , for sufficiently rapidly decaying potentials ,",
    "we obtain therefore the same scaling as for the case of hard core particles of diameter @xmath132 .      using these results ,",
    "we now determine how the relaxation rate scales with the parameters of the system . assuming the system to be in a qss we can then obtain its scaling as a function of @xmath5 alone . for clarity we drop irrelevant numerical prefactors , but these will be analyzed further in sect .",
    "[ quantitative ] .",
    "we define the relaxation rate @xmath136 as the inverse of the time scale at which the normalized average change in velocity squared due to collisions is equal to one .",
    "given that the estimated @xmath137 is the average change in a crossing time @xmath23 , we have therefore [ def_gamma ] _ dyn . in order to obtain the scaling with @xmath5 from the above results , we need to determine how the ratio @xmath138 scales with @xmath5 .",
    "using the definition eq .   and",
    "assuming , as stated above , that the modulus of the relative velocity of colliding particles can be taken to be of the same order as the typical velocity of a single particle @xmath139 , we have ( ) ^~ ~ ~ [ scaling - virialization ] where @xmath140 is the total kinetic energy and @xmath141 the total potential energy of the system .",

    "we can infer that [ scaling - bmin ] b_0~r n^-1/. using eqs .",

    "dyn~n^-(d-1-)/.    it follows that that the condition eq",
    ".   only holds for potentials with @xmath6 . only in this case",
    "therefore can the qss be supposed to exist as we have assumed . for @xmath9 , on the other hand , the relaxation induced by two body collisionality occurs on a time scale which is short compared to a particle crossing time , and a stationary non - thermal state can not exist on the latter time scale , i.e. , a qss can not exist .",
    "we consider now the case in which the power - law potential is  softened \" at short distances , i.e. , regulated so that the modulus of the force between two particles is bounded above at some finite value .",
    "the principle motivation for considering this case here is that , in practice , even for @xmath146 , we are unable numerically to test directly the validity of the scaling predictions eqs .  - for the exact ( singular ) potentials : the numerical cost of integrating sufficiently accurately hard two body scatterings over the long time scales required is prohibitive .",
    "instead we will consider power - law potentials softened at a scale @xmath147 , and study the scaling with both @xmath5 and @xmath147 of the relaxation rates in the numerically accessible range for these parameters .",
    "a detailed analysis of the two body scattering for such softened power law potentials has been given also in @xcite .",

    "- above , the parametric scalings of the relaxation rate . as in the previous section ,",
    "we defer until later a discussion of the exact numerical factors , for the specific smoothing functions used in our numerical simulations .    as softening modifies the force below a characteristic scale @xmath147 ,",
    "its effect is to modify the deflection angles for impact factor @xmath65 below a scale of the same order . from the considerations above it",
    "is then evident that , for @xmath148 , such a softening does not change the parametric scalings : it can only change the numerical value of the ( finite ) first integral in eq .  .",
    "for @xmath149 , on the other hand , the second integral in eq .   is modified because the functions @xmath125 are modified up to @xmath150 .",
