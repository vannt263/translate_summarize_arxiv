    "investigation of properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the main challenges of strong - interaction physics , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "many features of this matter were experimentally discovered at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven .",
    "the most striking result , obtained from analysis of these experimental data @xcite , is that the deconfined quark - gluon matter behaves as an almost perfect fluid rather than a perfect gas , as it could be expected from the asymptotic freedom .",
    "there are various approaches to studying qgp .",
    "each approach has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the most fundamental way to compute properties of the strongly interacting matter is provided by the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "interpretation of these very complicated computations requires application of various qcd motivated , albeit schematic , models simulating various aspects of the full theory .",
    "moreover , such models are needed in cases when the lattice qcd fails , e.g. at large baryon chemical potentials and out of equilibrium .",
    "a semi - classical approximation , based on a point like quasi - particle picture has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the main features of non - abelian plasmas can be understood in simple semi - classical terms without the difficulties inherent to a full quantum field theoretical analysis .",
    "independently the same ideas were implemented in terms of molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite .",
    "recently this md approach was further developed in a series of works @xcite .",
    "the md allowed one to treat soft processes in the qgp which are not accessible by perturbative means .",
    "a strongly correlated behavior of the qgp is expected to show up in long - ranged spatial correlations of quarks and gluons which , in fact , may give rise to liquid - like and , possibly , solid - like structures .",
    "this expectation is based on a very similar behavior observed in electrodynamic plasmas @xcite .",
    "this similarity was exploited to formulate a classical non - relativistic model of a color coulomb interacting qgp @xcite which was numerically analyzed by classical md simulations .",
    "quantum effects were either neglected or included phenomenologically via a short - range repulsive correction to the pair potential .",
    "such a rough model may become a critical issue at high densities . for temperatures and densities of the qgp considered in ref .",
    "@xcite these effects are very important as the quasiparticle thermal wave length is of order the average interparticle distance .    in this contribution",
    "we extend previous classical nonrelativistic simulations @xcite based on a color coulomb interaction to the quantum regime .",
    "we develop an approach based on path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations of the strongly coupled qgp which self - consistently takes into account the fermi ( bose ) statistics of quarks ( gluons ) .",
    "following an idea of kelbg @xcite , quantum corrections to the pair potential are rigorously derived @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to strongly coupled electrodynamic plasmas @xcite .",
    "examples are partially - ionized dense hydrogen plasmas , where liquid - like and crystalline behavior was observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , also partial ionization effects and pressure ionization could be studied from first principles @xcite .",
    "the same methods have been also applied to electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite , including excitonic bound states , which have many similarities to the qgp due to smaller mass differences as compared to electron - ion plasmas .",
    "first results of applications of the pimc method to the nonideal qgp have already been briefly reported in @xcite .",
    "our model is based on a resummation technique and lattice simulations for dressed quarks , antiquarks and gluons interacting via the color coulomb potential .",
    "the assumptions of the model are similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite :    i. : :    all color quasi - particles are heavy , i.e. their mass ( @xmath0 )    is higher than the mean kinetic energy per particle . for instance , at    zero net - baryon density it amounts to @xmath1 , where    @xmath2 is a temperature",
    ". therefore these particles move    non - relativistically .",
    "this assumption is based on the analysis of    lattice data @xcite .",
    "ii . : :    since the particles are non - relativistic , interparticle interaction is    dominated by a color - electric coulomb potential , see eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "magnetic effects are neglected as sub - leading ones .",
    ": :    relying on the fact that the color representations are large , the    color operators are substituted by their average values , i.e. by    classical color vectors , the time evolution of which is described by    wong s dynamics @xcite .",
    "the quality of these approximations and their limitations were discussed in ref .",
    "thus , this model requires the following quantities as an input :    1 . : :    the quasiparticle mass , @xmath0 , and 2 . : :    the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "all the input quantities should be deduced from the lattice data or from an appropriate model simulating these data .",
    "thus , we consider a three - component qgp consisting of a number of dressed quarks ( @xmath4 ) , antiquarks @xmath5 and gluons @xmath6 represented by quasi - particles . in thermal equilibrium the average values of these numbers can be found in the grand canonical ensemble defined by the temperature - dependent hamiltonian , which can be written as @xmath7 .",
    "the kinetic and color coulomb interaction energy of the quasi - particles are @xmath8 , \\qquad { \\hat{u}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j } \\frac{g^2(|r_i - r_j|,t,\\mu_q ) \\langle",

    "the large value of @xmath3 is also required to simulate larger values of casimirs ( defining the normalization of the color vectors ) in the @xmath10 group as compared to the @xmath106 one used here . moreover ,",

    "<S> a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) of heavy constituent quasiparticles is studied by a path - integral monte - carlo method , which improves the corresponding classical simulations by extending them to the quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this method is able to reproduce the lattice equation of state and also yields valuable insight into the internal structure of the qgp . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the qgp reveals liquid - like rather than gas - like properties . at temperatures just above the critical one </S>",
    "<S> it was found that bound quark - antiquark states still survive . </S>",
    "<S> these states are bound by effective string - like forces . </S>",
    "<S> quantum effects turned out to be of prime importance in these simulations . </S>"
