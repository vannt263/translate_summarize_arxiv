    "the second law of thermodynamics gives a fundamental limit to thermodynamic operations on systems in equilibrium states .",
    "one of its formulations provides the lower bound for the work performed on a system during a thermodynamics operation that induces a transition between equilibrium states ; the lower bound is given by the change in the free energy and is achieved for quasistatic operations .",
    "to establish analogous thermodynamic theory for nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) is one of the challenging problems in physics . in recent attempts",
    "@xcite , particularly investigated are relations to be satisfied by the work and entropy production ( or heat ) for transitions between nesss .",
    "one of the candidates for nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the steady state thermodynamics ( sst ) proposed in @xcite . a central idea of the sst is to use excess work ( and excess heat ) , which is defined as follows . in nonequilibrium states ,",
    "work is continuously supplied to the system , so that the total work @xmath0 during the transition between nesss diverges . therefore , for the construction of a meaningful thermodynamic theory for the transition , it is necessary to take a finite part out of @xmath0 . to this end , the excess work @xmath1 is defined by subtracting from @xmath0 the integral of the steady work flow in the instantaneous ness at each point of the operation @xcite .",
    "studies along this idea have been developed in refs .",

    "@xcite states that the excess work @xmath1 for quasistatic transitions is given by the change in a certain scalar potential . in the regime far from equilibrium , by contrast , the work version of refs .",
    "@xcite states that in general it is not equal to the change in any scalar function but equal to a geometrical quantity ; i.e. , it is given by a line integral of a vector potential @xmath2 in the operation parameter space .",
    "this suggests that @xmath2 plays an important role in sst .",
    "since these studies are based on the microscopic dynamics , the relationship with the microscopic state has been developed .",
    "in contrast , the relationship with macroscopic quantities has been less clear although there exist some studies on this issue @xcite .",
    "particularly important is to clarify how the transport coefficients and response functions are treated in the framework of sst , because the transport coefficients are main quantities to characterize ness and are accessible in experiments .    in this paper , as a first step toward this issue , we derive an expression of @xmath1 for quasistatic transitions in terms of the linear response function of ness .",
    "we show that @xmath1 is equal to the line integral of a vector potential @xmath2 and clarify the relation between @xmath2 and the response function .",
    "since the derivation relies only on the macroscopic phenomenological equation ( linear response relation ) , the result is universally valid ( independent of microscopic detail ) .",
    "we also show that in the regime near to equilibrium @xmath1 is given by the change of a scalar potential thanks to the reciprocal relation .",
    "furthermore , we connect the macroscopic theory for @xmath2 to microscopic physics by using a microscopic expression of the response function , which is called response - correlation relation ( rcr ) @xcite . we obtain a microscopic expression of @xmath2 that is consistent with the work version of the results in refs .  @xcite .",
