    "for instance , the sound speed is inferred to be @xmath1 lower than predicted at the radius of czb .",
    "similarly , the surface helium abundance and the radius of czb are @xmath2 lower and @xmath3 higher than those deduced from helioseismology ( see villante 2010 for the quoted numbers ) . given the precision at which we are capable of measuring helioseismological observables , the above represent discrepancies of the order of several @xmath4s ( see e.g. villante 2015 ) .",
    "there has been no shortage of proposed solutions , which include an anomalously large ne abundance in the photosphere ( bahcall et al . 2005 ) , physical processes not accounted for in the ssm ( montalban et al .",

    "however , none of these ideas seem to adequately solve the solar abundance problem ( see e.g. shearer et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in this paper we will instead investigate the possibility that the metallicity of the sun may not be sufficiently well known .",
    "the aforementioned _ low - z _ metallicity measurements rely on the methodology of photospheric spectroscopy .",
    "our approach is motivated by a completely different technique to estimate photospheric abundances , based on _ in situ _ measurements of heavy ions in the least fractionated solar wind accessible for direct _ in situ _ study of the photosphere .",
    "in particular von steiger & zurbuchen 2016 ( vsz16 henceforth ) , adopting the solar wind methodology , determine a value for the solar metallicity which is significantly higher than suggested by spectroscopic estimates .",
    "our paper does not seek to take sides between the two different methodologies to calculate the solar metallicity , but instead to estimate the consequences of the vsz16 methodology on solar models . in order to do this ,",
    "we make use of the _ linear solar model _ ( lsm ) formalism introduced in villante & ricci 2010 to explore the consistency of these new abundance measurements with constraints from helioseismology .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : solarwind ] discusses more in depth _ in situ _ solar wind measurements of solar metallicity .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] will provide details on the methodology adopted to study the impact on helioseismology observables .",
    "in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results , as well a caveat to the applicability of our methodology . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss the implications of these results for helioseismology , and provide concluding remarks .",
    "there are a number of different ways by means of which solar metallicity , @xmath5 , can be measured , and none of them is simple or straightforward . the aforementioned _ low - z _ abundance catalogues , in particular that of asplund et al .",
    "2009 ( agss09 henceforward ) , have been compiled making use of the methods of photospheric spectroscopy . despite its broad use within the solar physics community",
    ", spectroscopy is not immune to drawbacks and systematics .",
    "the interpretation of its observations requires sophisticated inversion techniques which account for radiative transport , three - dimensional structure and hydrodynamic models of the observation volumes , and departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in addition , the methodology also relies on detailed knowledge of the relevant atomic and molecular transition probabilities .",
    "an alternative method for determining the solar metallicity relies instead on _ in situ _ collection of solar samples , which eliminates the need for model inversion , but adds possible fractionation effects when _ in situ _ measurements are to be used to constrain the solar metallicity . for solar wind plasma compositions , various processes in the low coronal can affect the abundance of ions , based on their ionization , gravitational settling and transport histories",
    ". examples of fractionation processes at work are collisional coupling ( especially for he ) , first ionization potential ( fip ) fractionation ( hovestadt et al . 1973 ; bochsler 2000 ) presumably operating in the low solar atmosphere , and gravitational settling ( geiss et al .",
    "1970 ; weberg et al .",
    "2012 ) .    among all solar wind samples in the heliosphere , solar wind from polar coronal holes ( pchs ) is the least fractionated of all samples of steady state of transient solar wind flows ( zurbuchen 2007 ; zurbuchen et al .",
    "2012 ; zurbuchen et al .",
    "2016 ) . even in pch - associated wind , there is still some fractionation , especially of insufficient collisional coupling that affects all of solar wind , but is most evident in he / h ( geiss et al . 1970 ) .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the composition of these pchs is constant during the entire _ ulysses _ mission ( smith et al .",
    "1992 ) , which explored these polar regions during the period from 1990 to 2009 .",
    "the only observed residual changes relate to small variations of the ionization state , reflecting the temperature and acceleration history of the solar wind emerging from pchs .",
    "the elemental composition remains constant within the error bars of this methodology ( mccomas et al .",
    "2008 ; von steiger & zurbuchen 2011 ) .    as discussed in von steiger & zurbuchen 2016 , any other residual fractionation in these regions can not be excluded .",
    "however , based on the physical processes and a systematic study of various source regions , they concluded that such processes systematically decrease the overall solar metallicity ( see von steiger & zurbuchen 2015 , zurbuchen et al .",
    "2016 , for details ) . if this is correct , the _ in situ _",
    "measured @xmath5 represents a lower limit to the true metallicity of the sun .",
    "it is worth pointing out why these measurements were only recently published .",
    "previous data inversion methodologies used long - term averages and statistical inversion techniques as discussed by von steiger et al .",
    "only recently shearer et al .",
    "2014 generalized the inversion techniques to low count rates and leading to statistically robust estimates of trace elements used for the @xmath5 measurement .",
    "based on this analysis , vsz16 reports a lower limit on the solar metallicity , @xmath0 , which is significantly higher than the previous _ status quo _ agss09 value of @xmath6 ( which we take as our baseline model from here on ) .",
    "the sample analyzed has been shown to be most representative of that of the photosphere , in contrast to low - latitude and/or transient solar wind which is more prone to fractionation ( feldman et al .",
    "1998 ; reisenfeld et al .",
    "2013 ; von steiger & zurbuchen 2016 , zurbuchen et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the value derived by vsz16 is significantly closer to previous _ high - z _ compositions of anders & grevesse 1989 , and grevesse & sauval 1998 ( gs98 ) , which preceded the aforementioned downward revision of metallicity and which also yielded reasonable agreement with helioseismology .",
    "however , although the total metallicity is similar , the details concerning individual elemental abundances ( in particular , the abundance of refractory elements ) are quite different , an aspect which will have very important consequences for our subsequent considerations .",
    "our goal is to provide a first inspection of solar models in light of the _ high - z _ composition presented by vsz16 , in particular whether the new composition can restore consistency with helioseismology . here",
    ", we shall limit ourselves to conducting a first - order analysis of the problem making use of the _ linear solar model _",
    "( lsm ) methodology , developed in villante & ricci 2010 , and villante 2010 .",
    "we expect our simple semi - analytical approach to provide useful insight into the behavior of helioseismological observables in response to the change in composition being considered , but leave sophisticated numerical treatments to future work .",
    "furthermore , we note that our results agree with those obtained using a full non - linear treatment in serenelli et al .",
    "2016 , confirming _ a posteriori _ the goodness of our linear analysis .",
    "the solar abundance problem is deeply rooted to the role played by radiative opacity , @xmath7 , in the ssm .",
    "opacity is a key quantity which describes the tight coupling between radiation and matter in the hot dense interior of the sun .",
    "the main contributor to the opacity profile of the sun is constituted by metals , which contribute to the opacity through physical processes such as absorption by photoexcitation and photoionization .",
    "variations of the metal content of the sun can be effectively described as a fractional variation in its opacity profile , @xmath8 [ to be defined more precisely in eq.([defdk ] ) ] .",
    "let us take a baseline model of the sun with abundances @xmath9 .",
    "consider , then , a variation in abundances @xmath10 . the fractional variation in opacity @xmath11 with respect to the baseline model is defined as follows : @xmath12 therefore , the response of helioseismology observables to abundance variations can be related to the response of the fractional variation in opacity to the same changes .",
    "recent works have determined that a monotonic approximately linear fractional variation in the opacity with respect to the baseline agss09 model , from @xmath13 near the core to @xmath14 around the radius of czb , can restore agreement with helioseismological observables while satisfying constraints from neutrino fluxes ( christensen - dalsgaard et al .",

    "let us refer to this ",
    "ideal \" variation in opacity with respect to the baseline agss09 model as @xmath15 , which is given by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . more recent work seems to suggest that the radiative opacity of the sun is likely to have been underestimated , with a more accurate treatment of effects such as line broadening possibly going in the direction required to address discrepancies that are , at least in part , related to the solar abundance problem ( bailey et al .",
    "2015 , krief et al .",
    "2016 ) .     when comparing the vsz16 abundances to the baseline agss09 abundances .",

    "the dashed line denotes the  ideal \" opacity variation @xmath15 with respect to the agss09 model which would solve the  solar abundance problem \" while satisfying constraints on the solar neutrino fluxes . ]",
    "following villante et al .",
    "2014 , we express the fractional variation in opacity due to a variation in elemental abundances as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the logarithmic derivative of opacity with respect to metal abundance @xmath18 , that is : @xmath19 the index @xmath20 runs over the eight metals contributing to more than 98% of the metallicity of the sun : c , o , n , ne , mg , si , s , fe . by @xmath21",
    "we denote the fractional variation in the abundance of element @xmath20 in vsz16 with respect to its agss09 baseline value [ we will define @xmath21 precisely in the next paragraph , see eq .",
    "( [ aidefinition ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ deltazdefinition ] ) ] .",
    "let us provide a formal and operative definition of the fractional variation in elemental abundance of the @xmath20th element , @xmath21 . to begin with , we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be the number of atoms of the @xmath24th element and hydrogen which are present in the sun respectively ( from here on , the subscript @xmath25 will always refer to hydrogen ) .",
    "then , the logarithmic abundance of the @xmath24th elements relative to hydrogen , @xmath26 , is defined through the following relation : @xmath27 more precisely , @xmath26 correponds to the base 10 logarithm of the number of atoms of the @xmath24th element for every @xmath28 atoms of hydrogen in the sun . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath26 is usually referred to simply as the logarithmic abundance of the @xmath24th element , and we will conform to this standard .",
    "notice that , by construction , @xmath29 .",
    "hydrogen atoms . in this way",
    ", the addition of the factor 12 prevents the need for negative numbers , which used to be computationally problematic , when dealing with logarithmic abundances . ] then , given an element @xmath24 with logarithmic abundances @xmath30 and @xmath31 according to the agss09 and vsz16 abundances respectively , the fractional variation @xmath32 [ which enters eq .",
    "( [ deltakappa ] ) ] can be expressed as : @xmath33    the abundances of the eight metals according to vsz16 and agss09 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , and the variations in their abundances @xmath32 have been calculated accordingly to eq .",
    "( [ deltazdefinition ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the vsz16 abundances have been estimated as 20% systematics according to shearer et al .",
    "notice that the uncertainties on the solar wind measured metallicity values are typically a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding spectroscopic measurements . as can be seen , for all elements other than ne ,",
    "the abundances obtained _ in situ _ are significantly higher , with typical variations of order 0.2 dex or larger .",
    "this fact is particularly true for the refractory elements ( i.e. mg , si , s , fe ) , which crucially will affect all our results ( the abundances of refractories in agss09 are instead closer to the previous concordance values of gs98 ) .",
    "the values of abundances for the volatile elements in vsz16 ( i.e. c , n , o , ne ) are close to the original values of gs98 ( which yielded reasonable agreement with helioseismology ) especially with regards to c and o.    the functional forms of the @xmath34s , i.e. the logarithmic derivatives of radiative opacity with respect to metal abundances , are given in villante et al .",
    "2014 , and plotted in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we then use eq .",
    "( [ deltakappa ] ) to estimate the fractional variation in opacity , @xmath8 , associated to the variations in elemental abundances from agss09 to vsz16 listed in table  [ tab1 ] [ this corresponds to the quantity defined in eq  ( [ defdk ] ) when identifying @xmath9 and @xmath35 with the agss09 and vsz16 abundances respectively ] . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , including uncertainties propagated by those on the vsz16 abundances following eq .",
    "( [ deltakappa ] ) . in the same plot",
    ", we also compare our profile of opacity variation @xmath11 with the  ideal \" fractional variation in the opacity with respect to the baseline agss09 model , @xmath15 .",
    "the profile @xmath15 is given by the dashed line , and we notice that it differs substantially from the fractional variation in opacity when going from agss09 to vsz16 abundances we determined , @xmath11 .    c c c c +  element  &  @xmath36  & @xmath37  &  @xmath32   +  c  &  @xmath38  &  @xmath39  &  @xmath40   +  n  &  @xmath41  &  @xmath42  &  @xmath43   +  o  &  @xmath44  &  @xmath45  &  @xmath46   +  ne  &  @xmath47  &  @xmath48  &  @xmath49   +  mg  &  @xmath50  &  @xmath51  &  @xmath52   +  si  &  @xmath53  &  @xmath54  &  @xmath55   +  s  &  @xmath56  &  @xmath57  &  @xmath58   +  fe  &  @xmath59  &  @xmath60  &  @xmath61   +        0.5 cm [ fig2 ]    two considerations are in order at this point .",
    "the first is that the functional form of @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( which is principally driven by the large variations in the abundance of two refractory elements , si and s ) differs from the  ideal \" opacity variation with respect to the agss09 baseline model @xmath15 we mentioned earlier .",
    "recall @xmath15 consists in a monotonically increasing approximately linear function ranging from @xmath13 in the core to @xmath14 at the radius of czb , and is the variation in opacity required to restore agreement with helioseismology while simultaneously satisfying constraints from solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "a look at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] reveals how the scale of the @xmath8 associated to the vsz16 abundances is larger than the  ideal \" variation @xmath15 , represented by the dashed line , by more than 2@xmath4 over most of the profile of the sun .",
    "thus , we can already anticipate that the vsz16 abundances can not solve the solar abundance problem .",
    "the second consideration relates to the observation , already mentioned earlier , that the vsz16 abundances exhibit a quite contrasting behaviour depending on whether we are considering volatile ( i.e. c , n , o , ne ) or refractory ( i.e. mg , si , s , fe ) elements . these two classes of elements impact different regions of the solar interior : whereas volatiles play a major role around the radius of czb , refractories strongly impact the conditions in the core .",
    "in particular , an increase in the abundance of refractories correlates with a hotter core .",
    "the underlying reason is that refractory elements , because of their atomic number ( and hence the number number of protons in their nuclei ) being higher than that of volatile ones , are able to retain their outer shell electrons bound even in the higher temperatures present in the core .",
    "this allows them to make an important contribution to the opacity in the core of the sun through bound - bound , bound - free , and free - free absorption processes ) .",
    "the increase in opacity makes it harder for photons to escape the core , which thus becomes hotter .",
    "the fact that refractories have a large impact on the opacity in the core can be seen by inspecting the kernels @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    as we will discuss more thoroughly in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] , different helioseismology observables are most sensitive to different regions of the solar interior . observables which are most sensitive to the opacity and physical conditions around the radius of czb ( such as sound speed around the radius of czb , as well as the radius of czb itself , as we will explain subsequently in sec .",
    "[ sec : soundobservables ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : czbobservables ] ) , are consequently most sensitive to the abundance of volatiles , and are those for which we can reasonably expect an improvement over agss09 .",
    "helioseismology observables which instead depend most strongly on the opacity and physical conditions in the solar core ( such as surface helium abundance and neutrino fluxes , as well as the sound speed in the deep interior of the sun , as we will elucidate in sec .",
    "[ sec : heliumobservables ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinosobservables ] ) are therefore most sensitive to the abundance of refractories , and are those for which we can expect a worsening over agss09 . for more thorough discussions on the different impact of volatile and refractory elements on the properties of the sun ,",
    "we refer the reader to serenelli & basu 2010 , villante et al .",
    "2014 , villante 2015 , villante & serenelli 2015 , and serenelli et al . 2016 .      the fractional variation in opacity @xmath8 of vsz16 with respect to the baseline agss09 model , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is used to compute the response of helioseismology observables .",
    "we consider four observables : the sound speed @xmath66 , the surface helium abundance @xmath67 , the radius of czb @xmath68 , and five different solar neutrino fluxes : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the idea behind the lsm is that , for @xmath74 , the response of the sun is to good approximation linear in the input variables of the solar model ( that is , elemental abundances or , equivalently , opacity ) .",
    "therefore , the fractional variation of a generic given quantity @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the value of @xmath75 in the baseline model ) , can be related to the fractional opacity variation @xmath8 through a kernel @xmath78 as follows : @xmath79    combining eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] . here",

    "0.5 cm [ fig3 ]    the sound speed is very sensitive to the opacity profile at the base of the convective zone .",

    "as explained previously , volatile elements play a major part in shaping the opacity profile in that region .",
    "in particular , a key role is that played by oxygen .",
    "the abundances of vsz16 volatiles , in particular that of c and o , are significantly closer to previous concordance values of gs98 , than those of agss09 are . for this reason",
    ", we expect the sound speed profile of vsz16 to match observations better than that of agss09 , at least near the convective zone boundary , where agss09 was previously most discrepant .",
    "the surface helium abundance kernel , @xmath91 , has been calculated in villante 2010 and is plotted in fig .",
    "it is important to notice that the kernel is positive - valued and , thus , the surface helium abundance is highly sensitive to the overall scale of the opacity profile .",
    "recall we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : opacity ] how the scale of the vsz16 @xmath8 is higher than that of the  ideal \" variation with respect to the agss09 baseline model @xmath15 ( see fig .",

    "we could have reached the above conclusion by a simpler heuristic argument .",

    "of the five kernels , all but the one corresponding to the pp neutrino fluxes are positive - valued almost everywhere , reflecting the fact that an increase in opacity implies an increase in neutrino fluxes .    instead of numerically integrating the neutrino kernels , we choose a more simple but equivalent method to estimate the variations in neutrino fluxes .",

    "we conclude that vsz16 abundances are in extremely strong tension with the very accurate be and b neutrino flux measurements , and in less severe tension with the upper limits on n and o neutrinos .",

    "our findings agree with those of serenelli et al .",
    "2016 .",
    "we end the discussion with a caveat on the applicability of our methodology .",
    "we have performed a first - order analysis based on the linear solar model . strictly speaking ,",
    "this method is only valid for opacity variations sufficiently smaller than unity , that is , @xmath158 . yet , at intermediate radii , @xmath159 , so that we might expect the above approximation to break down and second - order effects might alter some of our results .",
    "our formalism does not capture higher - order effects , which can only be treated by doing a full non - linear study using e.g. solar codes .",
    "this , in fact , is the more complete approach taken in serenelli et al .",
    "2016 . from a practical point of view , however , we notice a very good agreement between our results and those of serenelli et al . 2016 .",
    "this lends us confidence _ a posteriori _ with regards to the goodness of our analysis and the applicability of the lsm to our problem ( despite the above concern ) .",
    "we can , however , make a more compelling case for the validity of the lsm to the problem we are considering . as we have discussed at length in this work , the observables which are most sensitive to the abundance of volatiles ( that is , sound speed and radius of czb ) are also most sensitive to the opacity at the bottom of the radius of czb .",
    "conversely , the observables which are most sensitive to the abundance of refractories ( that is , surface helium abundance and neutrino fluxes ) are also most sensitive to the opacity in the core of the sun .",
    "we notice that , both in the core of the sun and at the radius of czb , the central value of the variation in opacity is of order @xmath160 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is sufficiently small that the linear approximation might still be valid .",
    "we conclude that the good agreement between the results of the lsm and those obtained from the non - linear analysis of serenelli et al .",
    "2016 can be traced to the fact that the observables we considered are mostly sensitive to regions of the sun where the opacity variation @xmath161 is sufficiently small .",
    "one should , however , always keep these caveats in mind when comparing our results with those of serenelli et al .",
    "in addition , it is known that the the sun responds linearly to relatively large opacity variations , a fact which had first been noticed in tripathy & christensen - dalsgaard 1998 .",
    "the reason for this unexpected behaviour is not completely understood .",
    "however , it is likely to be connected to the fact that , when large opacity variations are considered , some of the initial parameters of solar codes ( e.g. the initial helium fraction ) need to be adjusted in order to satisfy the observational constraints on the sun s radius and luminosity . while these adjustments are automatically taken care of in the lsm , their physical effects is to partially reduce the initially large opacity variations to which the sun is subject ( francesco villante , personal communication ) . in any case , the net result is that , despite the relatively large variations in opacity , the lsm is applicable to our study .",
    "our results for neutrino fluxes deserve an aside .",
    "since their variations in response to the change in abundance from agss09 to vsz16 has been estimated to be of @xmath162 at linear order , we expect second - order effects to impact them the most .",
    "the lsm alone is not able to provide us the direction in which these effects go ( that is , they might in principle go in the opposite direction with respect to the first - order ones and hence possibly ameliorate the tension ) .",
    "however , we can cross - check our results with the full non - linear study of serenelli et al . 2016 .",
    "the conclusion is that second - order effects go in the same direction as the first - order ones , namely , they act to further increase the neutrino fluxes and hence worsen the disagreement with observations .",
    "it is worth remarking once more that our linear analysis reaches the same conclusion as the full non - linear study of serenelli et al .",
    "2016 : namely , that vsz16 abundances do not solve the  solar abundance problem \" , thus reaching our goal of determining whether solar wind measurements are able to solve this long - standing issue .",
    "moreover , our work also serves to highlight the goodness of the lsm as a tool to analyze the solar interior in a simple and transparent way .",
    "this work has a simple and straightforward purpose : it is to assess the implications for solar models of the abundances provided by von steiger & zurbuchen 2016 through solar wind analysis . for that purpose",
    ", we conducted a first - order analysis of the response of helioseismological observables to the change in abundances with respect to the previous _ status quo _ set by asplund et al . 2009 .",
    "our results indicate that , whereas for the convective zone boundary the overall agreement between solar data and the predicted behaviours is increased , the disagreement with the surface helium abundance is instead considerably worsened . the sound speed predicted by vsz16",
    "is considerably improved over that of agss09 at intermediate and large radii , but the discrepancy is severely worsened at small radii .",
    "the predictions for neutrino fluxes are strongly discrepant with current measurements : the be and b neutrino fluxes predicted by vsz16 are too high by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "our overall conclusion is that vsz16 abundances studied in the linear solar model do not solve the  solar abundance problem \" .",
    "we have identified the physical reason underlying both the improved agreements and worsened disagreements . on the one hand , the increase in volatile abundances ( especially c and o ) has brought their values closer to the previous concordance values of grevesse & sauval 1998 .",
    "volatile elements play a dominant role around the convective zone boundary , and thus their increase in abundance improves the agreement of observables which are most sensitive to the opacity profile in that region : the sound speed profile and the convective zone boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "the very large increase in the abundance of refractories , in particular si and s , correlates with an increase in core temperature .",
    "thus , the excessive increase in abundance of refractories worsens the disagreement of observables which are very sensitive to the conditions of the core , that is , surface helium abundance and neutrino fluxes .",
    "obviously , the vsz16 data themselves do not appear to address the  solar abundance problem \" .",
    "that might be due to residual fractionation in the solar atmosphere which is not excluded by vsz16 and also suggested by serenelli et al .",
    "in particular , it may be worth going back and taking a close look at both remote and _ in situ _ measurements of refractory elements ( see e.g. landi et al .",
    "2012 ) . and",
