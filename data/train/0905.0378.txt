    "the design and construction of one - dimensional artificial quantum structures at nanometric scales has opened a new realm of possibilities on the investigation of fundamental properties of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "one of these properties is tunneling which represents one of the paradigms of quantum mechanics . as discussed in quantum mechanics textbooks , tunneling of a particle of a given energy through a potential barrier yields in general partial transmission .",
    "full transmission is exhibited in resonant tunneling systems , which at least are formed by two barriers with a well in between .",
    "there , unity transmission may be achieved at some specific energies , the so called resonance energies @xcite .",
    "this yields , however , a time delay with respect to free propagation , that is proportional to the inverse of the resonance energy width @xcite , and hence it allows one to distinguish the tunneling particle from one evolving freely .",
    "the issue of total transparency of a tunneling particle by a potential along the full energy range has attracted attention over the years .",
    "it has been addressed within different frameworks : inverse scattering theory @xcite , supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , darbox transformation approach @xcite and group - theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "these works refer to a number of exactly solvable potentials , usually named _ reflectionless _ or _ transparent _ potentials , for which the reflection amplitude vanishes identically , while the transmission amplitude has modulus @xmath0 for all incident energies @xmath1 including the threshold energy value @xmath2 .",
    "a well - known example is the pschl - teller ( p - t ) potential well , which for very specific values of the potential parameters attains unity transmission at all energies @xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "transparent _ potentials have escaped , to the best of our knowledge , experimental verification and are mainly of interest in mathematically oriented studies .",
    "a possible reason is that transparency in these potentials is tightly bound to the functional dependence of the potential .",
    "here we investigate to what extent one may design potential profiles in one dimension ( 1d ) that , in addition to being totally transparent to a tunneling particle , can not be detected by interference experiments .",
    "our motivation is purely theoretical and would lead to the possibility of designing _",
    "invisible _ quantum systems .",
    "our approach rests on analytical properties of the outgoing green s function of the system in the complex momentum plane that hold provided the potential vanishes beyond a distance and the transmission is a coherent , elastic process .",
    "these analytical properties consist of having a bound or an antibound pole very close to the energy threshold and all other poles far away and overlapping among themselves .",
    "we find that one may design potential profiles in 1d that possess two regimes for transmission of incident monochromatic energy particles",
    ". in one regime , occurring at very small controllable energies close to the energy threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ , a very small fraction of the potential barrier height , the transmission coefficient rises sharply from zero to unity , and in the other regime , which involves the rest of tunneling energies and energies extending up to several times the potential barrier height , the particle attains essentially unity transmission .",
    "we show that in the unity - transmission regime the transmission phase has a vanishing value , which implies indeed that interference experiments can not detect the scattering potential and , in addition , that the _ dwell time _ , which provides the relevant time scale for the tunneling process , is indistinguishable from that of a free particle . as a consequence of the above considerations we find that in the unity - transmission regime these systems are indeed invisible to a tunneling particle .",
    "moreover , since in time domain , extremely small energies correspond to very long times , we obtain that these systems are essentially invisible to tunneling by an incident pulse or wave packet",
    ". we shall refer to these systems as _",
    "invisible _ systems .",
    "it is worth noticing that here invisibility refers to a different process from studies that involve the design of a cloak surrounding a system that then becomes invisible to light @xcite or with approaches in the quantum domain , refer to as quantum cloaking , where a system is surrounded by a cloak to become invisible to matter waves at certain incident energies in two dimensions ( 2d ) and three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite .",
    "these approaches are based on ideas from transformation optics and refer only to a time - independent description .",
    "we do not surround a system with a cloak but rather we design systems that become invisible to matter waves and consider both the energy and time domains .",
    "contrary to _ transparent _ potentials where full transmission is tightly bound to the functional dependence of these potentials , the potentials considered here are robust against some variation in the functional dependence of the potential profile .",
    "one may consider rectangular or continuous shapes formed by distinct combinations of barriers and wells .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider the resonance formalism and the relationship between the transmission amplitude and the distribution of its complex poles .",
    "section iii deals with _ invisible _ systems through a number of subsections that discuss , respectively , the rectangular barrier and the pschl - teller potential , multibarrier systems , the dwell time , and wave - packet scattering .",
    "finally , section iv , gives the concluding remarks .",

    "this procedure is in fact numerically equivalent to standard numerical calculations such as the transfer - matrix method @xcite .",
    "however , it yields a deeper physical insight by establishing a link between the analytical properties of the outgoing green s function on the complex @xmath27 plane and the behavior with energy of the transmission phase and the transmission coefficient .",

    "the position of the poles @xmath28 on the complex @xmath27 plane is a function of both the parameters of the potential and the mass of the particle .",

    "we denote , respectively , the barrier heights and depths by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , measured in ev , and the rectangular barrier and well widths by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , measured in nm .",
