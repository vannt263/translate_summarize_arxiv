    "massive stars are key to understanding many physical phenomena in the galaxy , however their first stages of formation are still poorly understood .",
    "one of the main reasons is that massive stars evolve more quickly to the main - sequence than low mass stars , and they radiate large amounts of ultraviolet ( uv ) photons and drive strong winds while they are still deeply embedded and accreting matter ( e.g. ,  beuther & shepherd 2005 ; keto 2007 ) .",
    "the interaction of the uv radiation and winds with the surrounding environment , resulting in bright radio continuum sources , must be well understood to comprehend the formation of high - mass stars .",

    "rodrguez et al .",
    "2005 ) ; _ iv ) _ ionized accretion flows where the material becomes ionized while accreting onto the massive protostar ( e.g. ,  keto 2002 , 2003 , 2007 ) ; _ v ) _ photoevaporated disks where the radiation of the newly - formed star ionizes and evaporates the surrounding disk ( e.g. ,  hollenbach et al .  1994 ;",

    "all these mechanisms produce radio continuum sources with spectral indices , @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) , between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( i.e. , thermal emission ; see rodrguez et al .",
    "in addition , several works have found negative spectral indices ( typical of non - thermal emission ) associated with massive ysos ( e.g. ,  rodrguez et al .",

    "these non - thermal sources can be young stars with active magnetospheres producing gyro - synchrotron emission ( e.g. ,  feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) ; synchrotron emission from fast shocks in disks or jets ( e.g. ,  reid et al .",

    "a similar description of these mechanisms producing centimeter continuum emission can be found in rodrguez et al .",

    "the major difference between the fdds of core , core - n and core - s is the flux density at 7  mm .",

    "we report the detection of four distinct radio continuum sources toward the high - mass star forming region g75 : uchii , east , core - n and core - s ( the latter two correspond to the core source for angular resolutions coarse than @xmath34 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the nature of these four sources .      the uchii and east sources can be well - characterized as homogeneous  regions with sizes ( 3800  au and 900  au ) and electron densities ( @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xmath5 ) characteristic of small ultracompact  regions ( e.g. ,  kurtz 2005 ) .",
    "they are probably ionized by b0 and b0.5 zams stars , respectively , and are optically thin at centimeter wavelengths ( i.e. ,  spectral index of @xmath10 ; see table  [ tg75:physpar ] ) . despite these similarities ,",
    "the two sources are distinctly different in their infrared emission .",
    "in particular , there is substantial ir dust emission associated with the east source but not with the uchii source . in figure  [ fg75:irall ]",
    "we show infrared and submillimeter images of the g75 star - forming complex .",
    "infrared emission between 2.2 and 8.0  @xmath8 m is clearly associated with the east source , while no infrared emission at these wavelengths is associated with the cometary uchii source ( cf .",
    "close - up views in figure  [ fg75:irall ] ) .",
    "the absence of infrared emission from the uchii source is unusual ; ultracompact  regions typically present substantial ir emission ( hoare et al .",
    "a possible explanation is that the uc  region may be partially obscured by a cloud of gas and dust that absorbs the near- and mid - infrared emission .",
    "in fact , such a cloud is seen in emission at submillimeter wavelengths ( cf .",
    "emission at 450 and 850  @xmath8 m in figure  [ fg75:irall ] ; di francesco et al .",
    "2008 ) , and in absorption at infrared wavelengths ( cf .",
    "obscured region in the infrared maps in figure  [ fg75:irall ] ) , and its peak falls very close to the uchii source .",
    "in addition , if the east source were located closer to the border of the dust cloud ( seen in the 450  @xmath8 m and 850  @xmath8 m images ) , its ir emission would be less obscured than that of the uchii source , resulting in the different infrared properties of the two sources .",
    "the non - detection of uchii at 1.3  mm ( see fig .  [ fg75:contmm ] ) does not contradict this scenario ; as we noted in sect .",
    "[ sg75:resmm ] , the non - dection is probably due to inadequate sensitivity .      regarding the emission from the core ( n and s ) source , we examine several models to explain the origin of the ionized gas emission .",
    "franco et al .  (",
    "2000 ) modeled the core source as an  region with a density distribution @xmath35 , motivated by optically thick centimeter continuum emission at frequencies up to @xmath3100  ghz .",

    "figure  [ fg75:seds2 ] suggests that a homogeneous density distribution can account for the emission from the n and s sources .",
    "furthermore , the rrl upper limits are also consistent with optically thin emission . assuming optically thin emission for line and continuum , and @xmath36 upper limits for h30@xmath2 and h40@xmath2 ( i.e. ,  30 and 45  m@xmath37 , respectively ) , we can calculate the expected continuum emission from ionized gas with ( rohlfs & wilson 2004 ) @xmath38 =   6940 \\bigg[\\frac{\\delta v}{\\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}}\\bigg]^{-1 } \\bigg[\\frac{t_\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{k}}\\bigg]^{-1.15 } \\bigg[\\frac{\\nu}{\\mathrm{ghz}}\\bigg]^{1.1},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the line flux density , @xmath40 is the continuum flux density , @xmath41 is the width of the radio recombination line ( assumed to be 30  km  s@xmath29 ; kurtz 2005 ) , @xmath19 is the electron temperature assumed to be @xmath20  k , and @xmath17 is the frequency of the line .",
    "we find that the continuum flux density of ionized gas at 3 and 1  mm should be @xmath4230 and @xmath4218  mjy , respectively .",

    "thus , we conclude that the ionized gas emission becomes optically thin for frequencies @xmath4430  ghz .",
    "this new result , compared to franco et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , arises because we resolve the core source into two components .    from the fdd analysis ( see section  [ sg75:seds ] ) , both sources ( core - n and s ) appear to be hypercompact  regions ionized by b0.5 zams stars , and separated by a distance of @xmath45 ( 1400  au at a distance of 3.8  kpc ) .",
    "this scenario suggests a wide , massive binary system ( sana & evans 2011 ) .",
    "we searched the literature for similar systems , with two close massive radio continuum sources , and found several examples : in g31.41 + 0.31 there is a system of two centimeter continuum sources separated by @xmath46 ( 1500  au at 7.9  kpc ; araya et al .",

    "thus , it seems that it is not unusual to detect double radio continuum sources , separated by @xmath32000  au , in massive star - forming regions .",
    "it should be noted that the radio continuum emission from some of the previously listed binary systems is not always interpreted as arising from photo - ionized  regions .",
    "araya et al .",
    "( 2009 ) propose that the radio continuum emission in dr(21)oh is free - free radiation originating in interstellar shocks , following the theoretical development of ghavamian & hartigan ( 1998 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the free - free emission arises from shock - ionized , rather than photo - ionized , gas , being comparable to the herbig - haro objects seen in the optical .",
    "we note that the infrared emission at 4.5  @xmath8 m ( see figure  [ fg75:irall ] ) shows an elongated structure ` emanating ' from the position of the core source .",

    "however , in g75 , the northeast - southwest direction of the 4.5  @xmath8 m elongated structure is consistent with the direction of the molecular outflow likely associated with the core source ( see the solid / dashed contours in the bottom middle panel of figure  [ fg75:irall ] , snchez - monge 2011 ) which is also consistent with the direction of the outflow reported by riffel & ldke ( 2010 ) at larger scales , thus favoring the interpretation of the 4.5  @xmath8 m emission arising from shocks .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of water masers ( figure  [ fg75:masers ] ) is also indicative of shocks and jets , as found in other star forming regions ( e.g. ,  iras  20126 + 4104 : hofner et al .",
    "2007 ) . a milliarcsecond kinematical study of water masers in g75.78 + 0.34 ( see figure  3 in ando et al .",
    "2011 ) is consistent with a shock interpretation for the centimeter continuum emission .",
    "the group of masers associated with core - s have velocities mainly in the southwest direction ( similar to the elongated structure seen at 4.5  @xmath8 m ) , while the two groups of maser spots located to the northwest and southeast of core - s show a velocity field suggesting expansion .",
    "together with the arc morphology of all the maser spots this is suggestive of a bow - shock , implying that at least the core - s emission might arise from shocks .    a stellar jet / outflow with a mass - loss rate larger than @xmath50  m@xmath7  yr@xmath29 and a terminal velocity of order several hundred km  s@xmath29 , shocking the ambient medium , would have sufficient energy to ionize , heat , and move the gas of both the core - n and core - s sources ( see appendix  [ appen ] ) .",
    "although the cooling time ( and hence recombination ) of the high density gas is very short ( franco et al .",
    "1994 ) , the jet / outflow would continuously re - ionize the material . in this case , the exciting source would be located between the two radio continuum sources , with its own  region quenched by the high density medium .",
    "i.e. , a jet / outflow with such a high mass - loss rate would be neutral because the ionization front would be trapped very close to the star .",
    "the possibility of a neutral jet / outflow shocking the ambient gas can not presently be ruled out because our observations are sensitive to ionized gas .",
    "this scenario can be tested with future centimeter continuum observations with the jvla , to determine if core - s ( and the water maser spots ) have been displaced with respect to the other continuum sources . assuming a jet velocity of order several hundred km  s@xmath29 , relative motions could be detected within the next five years .    as noted in section  [ sg75:intro ]",
    ", other mechanisms might also cause the centimeter emission from core - n and s. however , we consider most of these to be unlikely candidates . equatorial winds ( hoare 2006 ) or thermal radio jets ( anglada 1996 ) typically predict constant spectral indices of @xmath51 and a relation between the source size and the frequency .",
    "our observations indicate spectral indices @xmath3 + 1 ; the uncertainties in the deconvolved source sizes are too large to determine a size  frequency dependence . a photoevaporated disk model has been proposed to explain the continuum emission of double - peaked sources with an hour - glass morphology ( lugo et al .",
    "although the core n and s peaks might be fit as a photoevaporated disk , recent studies indicate that the peaks from photoevaporated disks should change their separation with frequency , moving closer at higher frequencies ( tafoya et al .",
    "the peak positions of n and s do not change between 3.6 and 0.7  cm to a precision of @xmath3@xmath52 .",
    "summarizing , the centimeter continuum emission from core n and s can be well fitted by homogeneous  regions , each one photo - ionized by a b0.5 zams star .",
    "alternatively , free - free radiation from shock - ionized gas resulting from the interaction of a jet / outflow system with the surrounding environment appears to be a viable scenario as well .",
    "other possible mechanisms are deemed unlikely .",
    "we have carried out subarcsecond angular resolution observations with the vla in the centimeter continuum and in h@xmath0o  and ch@xmath1oh  maser emission toward the massive star forming complex g75.78 + 0.34 .",
    "we have complemented these observations with ovro and sma millimeter continuum and radio recombination line observations , and submillimeter / infrared data from on - line databases .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    our radio continuum data reveal centimeter continuum emission at all wavelengths , with the emission coming from four distinct compact sources : uchii , east , core - n and core - s .",
    "the two last sources appear unresolved ( core source ) when observed with angular resolutions @xmath12@xmath34 .",
    "the strongest source , uchii , is a cometary uc  region with a size of 0.02  pc ( 3800  au ) , an electron density of @xmath53  @xmath5 and is ionized by the equivalent of a b0 zams star .",
    "the east source , located @xmath54  to the east of uchii , is also an uc  region with an electron density of @xmath55  @xmath5 , ionized by a b0.5 equivalent zams star , but with a smaller ( barely resolved ) size of 0.004  pc ( 900  au ) .",
    "the millimeter continuum emission associated with these two uc  regions has different origins : for the uchii source it probably traces the ionized gas , while for the east source there is a millimeter excess , suggesting that this source is still embedded in a compact dust clump also detectable at mid - infrared wavelengths , with a mass of 1536  m@xmath7 .",
    "we suggest that the non - detection of thermal dust emission in the uchii source results from foreground extinction , not from an absence of warm dust .",
    "the core - n and s sources are located 2  to the southwest of the cometary arc of the uchii source , and are associated with water maser and dense molecular gas emission .",
    "the two sources are very close to one another ( @xmath45 , 1400  au ) and have similar properties : flux density increasing with frequency , and unresolved emission .",
    "the free - free continuum emission may be produced by two hypercompact  regions ionized by b0.5 zams stars or by the collision between a jet / outflow and the surrounding environment .",
    "a dust clump of @xmath56  m@xmath7  associated with the core source is detected at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "we have also reported high angular resolution observations of h@xmath0o  and class  i ch@xmath1oh  maser emission . the class  i methanol maser spots are found far from any of the radio continuum sources , and are probably excited by collisional processes due to the presence of multiple molecular outflows .",
    "the water maser spots appear close to the core - n and s sources , with only a few of them spatially coincident with the s source .",
    "the spatial distribution of the water masers and the kinematics observed at milliarcsecond angular resolution , suggest that they could originate in a shock between a jet / outflow and the local surroundings .",
    "in addition , extended 4.5  @xmath8 m emission likely tracing shocked gas could be associated with a jet driven by the core source .    in summary , we have characterized the radio - continuum emission toward the massive star forming complex g75.78 + 0.34 , revealing the presence of four sources : two ultracompact  regions ( named uchii and east ) ionized by b0b0.5 zams stars , one with an extended and cometary shape and the other being barely resolved ; and two compact sources ( named core - n and core - s ) associated with at least one massive protostar embedded in a dense and massive envelope and with hints of driving an outflow .",

    "<S> we present sub - arcsecond observations toward the massive star forming region g75.78 + 0.34 . </S>",
    "<S> we used the very large array to study the centimeter continuum and h@xmath0o and ch@xmath1oh maser emission , and the owens valley radio observatory and submillimeter array to study the millimeter continuum and recombination lines ( h40@xmath2 and h30@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found radio continuum emission at all wavelengths , coming from three components : ( 1 ) a cometary ultracompact ( uc )  region with an electron density @xmath3@xmath4  @xmath5 , excited by a b0 type star , and with no associated dust emission ; ( 2 ) an almost unresolved uc  region ( east ) , located @xmath36  to the east of the cometary uc  region , with an electron density @xmath3@xmath6  @xmath5 , and associated with a compact dust clump detected at millimeter and mid - infrared wavelengths ; and ( 3 ) a compact source ( core ) , located @xmath32  to the southwest of the cometary arc , with a flux density increasing with frequency , and embedded in a dust condensation of 30  m@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the core source is resolved into two compact and unresolved sources which can be well - fit by two homogeneous hypercompact  regions each one photo - ionized by a b0.5 zams star , or by free - free radiation from shock - ionized gas resulting from the interaction of a jet / outflow system with the surrounding environment . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution and kinematics of water masers close to the core - n and s sources , together with excess emission at 4.5  @xmath8 m and the detected dust emission , suggest that the core source is a massive protostar driving a jet / outflow . </S>"
