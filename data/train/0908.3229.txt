    "let us first recall how perelman s collapsing theorem for @xmath0-manifolds plays an important role in his solution to thurston s geometrization conjecture on the classification of @xmath0-manifolds .      in 2002 - 2003 ,",
    "perelman posted online three important but densely written preprints on ricci flows with surgery on compact @xmath0-manifolds ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , in order to solve both the poincar conjecture and thurston s conjecture on geometrization of @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "thurston s geometrization conjecture states that _  for any closed , oriented and connected @xmath0-manifold @xmath26 , there is a decomposition @xmath80 = n^3_1 \\cup n^3_2 \\cdots \\cup n^3_{m}$ ] such that each @xmath81 admits a locally homogeneous metric with possible incompressible boundaries @xmath82 , where @xmath82 is homeomorphic to a quotient of a @xmath28-sphere or a @xmath28-torus \" .",
    "_ there are exactly 8 homogeneous spaces in dimension 3 .",
    "the list of @xmath0-dimensional homogeneous spaces includes 8 geometries : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thurston s geometrization conjecture suggests the existence of especially nice metrics on @xmath0-manifolds and consequently , a more analytic approach to the problem of classifying @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "richard hamilton formalized one such approach by introducing the ricci flow equation on the space of riemannian metrics : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ricci curvature tensor of the metric @xmath93 .",
    "beginning with any riemannian manifold @xmath94 , there is a solution @xmath93 of this ricci flow on @xmath95 for @xmath96 in some interval such that @xmath97 . in dimension @xmath0 ,",
    "the fixed points ( up to re - scaling ) of this equation include the riemannian metrics of constant ricci curvature .",
    "for instance , they are quotients of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 up to scaling factors .",
    "it is easy to see that , on compact quotients of @xmath98 or @xmath84 , the solution to ricci flow equation is either stable or expanding .",
    "thus , on compact quotients of @xmath98 and @xmath84 , the solution to ricci flow equation exists for all time @xmath99 .    however , on quotients of @xmath87 or @xmath85 , the solution @xmath100 to ricci flow equation exists only for finite time @xmath101 .",
    "hence , one knows that in general the ricci flow will develop singularities in finite time , and thus a method for analyzing these singularities and continuing the flow past them must be found .    these singularities may occur along proper subsets of the manifold , not the entire manifold .",
    "thus , perelman introduced a more general evolution process called ricci flow with surgery ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a similar process was first introduced by hamilton in the context of four - manifolds .",
    "this evolution process is still parameterized by an interval in time , so that for each @xmath96 in the interval of definition there is a compact riemannian @xmath0-manifold @xmath102 .",
    "however , there is a discrete set of times at which the manifolds and metrics undergo topological and metric discontinuities ( surgeries ) .",
    "perelman did surgery along @xmath28-spheres rather than surfaces of higher genus , so that the change in topology for @xmath103 turns out to be completely understood .",
    "more precisely , perelman s surgery on @xmath0-manifolds is _ the reverse process of taking connected sums : _ cut a @xmath0-manifold along a @xmath28-sphere and then cap - off by two disjoint @xmath0-balls .",
    "perelman s surgery processes produced exactly the topological operations needed to cut the manifold into pieces on which the ricci flow can produce the metrics sufficiently controlled so that the topology can be recognized .",
    "it was expected that each connected components of resulting new manifold @xmath104 is either a graph - manifold or a quotient of one of homogeneous spaces listed above .",
    "it is well - known that any graph - manifold is a union of quotients of 7 ( out of the 8 possible ) homogeneous spaces described above .",
    "more precisely , perelman presented a very densely written proof of the following result .",
    "[ thm0.4 ] let @xmath105 be a closed and oriented riemannian @xmath0-manifold .",
    "then there is a ricci flow with surgery , say @xmath106 , defined for all @xmath107 with initial metric @xmath94 .",
    "the set of discontinuity times for this ricci flow with surgery is a discrete subset of @xmath108 .",
    "the topological change in the @xmath0-manifold as one crosses a surgery time is a connected sum decomposition together with removal of connected components , each of which is diffeomorphic to one of @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , there are two possibilities :    \\(1 ) either the ricci flow with surgery terminates at a finite time @xmath111 . in this case , @xmath112 is diffeomorphic to the connect sum of @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in particular , if @xmath112 is simply - connected , then @xmath112 is diffeomorphic to @xmath113 .",
    "\\(2 ) or the ricci flow with surgery exists for all time , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "the detailed proof of perelman s theorem above can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , if @xmath26 is a simply - connected closed manifold , then using a theorem of hurwicz , one can find that @xmath115 .",
    "hence , there is a map @xmath116 of degree @xmath40 .",
    "one can view @xmath113 as a two - point suspension of @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118/\\{0 , 1\\}$ ] .",
