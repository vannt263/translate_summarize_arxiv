    "the determination of the shape of a baryon is an interesting problem that addresses complex technical issues , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view @xcite . recently ,",
    "for example , there has been particular interest ( and controversy ) about possible deviations from a spherically symmetric shape of the nucleon . in this work",
    "we will address another interesting question , namely whether the @xmath0 baryon has a spherical shape or not , and maybe more importantly , what we mean by that .",
    "information on a baryon s shape is encoded in its electromagnetic form factors , which can be measured , at least in principle .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors describe how a particle interacts with a photon , and the number of independent form factors depends on the particle s spin .",
    "a particle with spin-1/2 , such as the nucleon , is characterized by only two form factors , namely the electric charge @xmath3 and magnetic dipole @xmath4 , whereas a particle with spin-3/2 , such as the @xmath0 , has altogether four form factors , namely , in addition to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , also electric quadrupole @xmath5 and magnetic octupole @xmath6 form factors .",
    "higher - order form factors and moments can provide a measure of the deformation of an extended particle .",
    "for instance , nonvanishing values of the electric quadrupole moment and of the magnetic octupole moment , which are proportional to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , indicate a deviation of the charge and magnetic dipole distributions from the spherically symmetric form @xcite .    at this point",
    ", it is important to distinguish between `` spectroscopic '' and `` intrinsic '' moments , the former being the observable values of the corresponding electromagnetic form factor at zero momentum transfer , whereas the latter refer to quantities calculated from charge or magnetic density distributions , which are not directly observable @xcite .",
    "for instance , nucleons or spin-1/2 nuclei do not possess an electric quadrupole or magnetic octupole moment , and therefore they can not be deformed if finite higher spectroscopic moments are used as criteria for deformation",
    ". on the other hand , their intrinsic density distribution may not be spherically symmetric , giving rise to nonvanishing intrinsic higher moments @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat simpler in the case of the @xmath0 , the lightest baryon with spin-3/2 and first candidate for a nonvanishing electric quadrupole moment , because its intrinsic and spectroscopic quadrupole moments differ only by a constant factor @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a strong motivation to estimate the @xmath0 electric quadrupole moment .",
    "previous studies on the deformation of the @xmath0 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is only in the nonrelativistic limit that the spatial distributions of the charge and magnetic densities are related to the electromagnetic form factors through a fourier transform , such that information about the shape of the density distributions can be accessed through form factor data : in the breit frame , the charge distribution is the fourier transform of @xmath3 , and the magnetic dipole density is the fourier transform of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation has its limitations . in a relativistic description ,",
    "the spatial distribution of charge or magnetic densities depends on the reference frame .",
    "when an absorbed photon imparts only a small momentum to the baryon , this frame dependence can be ignored , but in the general relativistic case there is no direct relation between form factors and coordinate - space densities .",
    "it was to address this difficulty that alternative concepts to measure deformation were proposed , such as transverse densities and moments @xcite and spin - dependent density distributions @xcite .",
    "transverse density distributions were introduced recently within the context of a light - front description of the electromagnetic current . in this formulation ,",
    "the charge and magnetic density distribution of a particle is described as seen from a light - front moving towards the particle .",
    "the longitudinal direction is effectively eliminated by projecting the density onto the transverse plane , which is not subject to lorentz contraction .    for spin polarizations in the transverse plane , radially asymmetric transverse density distributions can be obtained , which may then be analyzed in terms of multipoles .",
    "however , it is not clear how exactly they are connected to the intrinsic deformation of the particle s density distribution in its rest frame .",
    "for instance , just as in a number of previous model calculations , a recent lattice qcd study found a negative value of the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath2 baryon in the state with spin projection 3/2 , implying an oblate intrinsic deformation relative to the spin direction , whereas the corresponding transverse charge density field pattern shows a prolate shape @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that information about deformation should be deduced by comparing the transverse moments to the so - called `` natural '' moments of structureless , elementary particles . in this formulation ,",
    "a particle is _ defined _ as elementary if its light - cone helicity is nontrivially conserved at tree level .",
    "the argument given to support this assumption is that in a composite particle the elementary constituents can jump between orbital states and thereby change the particle s total helicity , whereas this is not possible if the particle has no constituents @xcite .",
    "for such a structureless particle with spin 3/2 and charge @xmath9 ( specified in units of the proton charge ) , the natural moments  labeled here with the superscript @xmath10are @xcite g^(nat)_e2(0)= - 3 e _",
    ", g^(nat)_m3(0)= - e _ , [ eqgnatural ] besides g^(nat)_e0(0)= e _",
    ", g^(nat)_m1(0)= 3 e_. [ eqgnatural2 ] in the example of the @xmath2 with spin projection 3/2 , a negative sign of @xmath11 is consistent with a prolate transverse charge density distribution if @xmath12 .",
    "in general , the transverse electric quadrupole moment is only a function of the anomalous electromagnetic moments @xcite , and a nonzero value indicates a deviation from a pointlike structure when viewed from the light - front .",
    "the question remains what the transverse moments can tell us about the intrinsic density deformation in the rest frame . in the following",
    "we present the intrinsic three - dimensional rest - frame densities obtained in covariant model calculations of the @xmath0 baryon , and we will return to this question when we discuss our results .    in this work we used relativistic quark - diquark model wave functions of the @xmath0 baryon that were constructed within the covariant spectator theory  @xcite to calculate charge and magnetic density distributions , both in momentum and coordinate space .",
    "thus we have direct information about their shape .",
    "in particular , we compared two models , one which includes only @xmath13-waves and is therefore spherically symmetric , and another that includes @xmath14-wave components that induce a small deformation .",
    "we determined then how this shape information manifests itself in the higher moments , as well as in the corresponding transverse moments .",
    "we want to emphasize that our moments are not calculated at tree level and contain anomalous contributions . therefore they do not reduce to the natural values of eqs .",
    "( [ eqgnatural ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eqgnatural2 ] ) .    with a spherically symmetric spatial wave function , where the quark and diquark are in a relative @xmath13-wave @xcite , we obtained g_e2(0)= 0 , g_m3(0)=0 .",
    "[ eqsp01 ] this result does not depend on any specific model parameters , but holds in general as long as only @xmath13-waves are present .",
    "once higher orbital angular momentum components are included in the quark - diquark wave function , nonvanishing values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are generated @xcite .",
    "this indicates that it is possible to relate deviations from spherical symmetry in the charge ( dipole moment ) distribution to the value of the electric quadrupole ( magnetic octupole ) moment , similar to what was found in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the calculated values of the transverse quadrupole and octupole moments on the other hand do not seem to give any clear indication on the deformation of the density distributions .",

    "the negative value of the quadrupole moment corresponds to an oblate density distribution in coordinate space .",

    ", we also calculated the corresponding transverse density quadrupole and octupole moments ( @xmath221 and @xmath123 ) . for each moment , the obtained values ( see table [ tableqdel ] ) for models spectator - s and spectator - sd are nonvanishing and of the same sign , and thus do not show a clear distinction between spherically symmetric and deformed cases .",
    "since the transverse moments are nonzero one can conclude that the system is not seen as a point in impact parameter space when viewed from the light - front frame , but it is not clear how further information on its shape could be extracted . in this sense ,",
    "the usual three - dimensional density distribution complements the information contained in the transverse densities , and it is also closer to our intuitive notion of deformation .    for the specific case of the @xmath2 baryon with spin projection @xmath175 ,",
    "the covariant model spectator - sd predicts an oblate shape of its density distribution in coordinate space .",
    "this is in agreement with previously obtained results , both from other quark model calculations and lattice qcd simulations .",
    "all model parameters were determined through fits to the available lattice qcd data for the @xmath225 transition form factors at large pion mass , where the uncertain pion cloud effects are minimal ( the experimental data are also well predicted ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath23 are determined by the lattice transition form factors for @xmath226 , namely @xmath21 is determined by the electric quadrupole form factor @xmath227 and @xmath23 by the coulomb quadrupole form factor @xmath228 .",
