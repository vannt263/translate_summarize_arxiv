    "massive stars transfer energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) in two ways during their lifetime : by radiative luminosity ( @xmath2 ) and by mechanical luminosity due to winds ( @xmath3) where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the mass loss rate and @xmath6 is the wind terminal velocity. in the `` single scattering upper limit '' approximation , which assumes that the momentum of the wind is equal that of the radiation , the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind is less than one per cent of the stellar radiative luminosity , @xmath7 , for a typical terminal velocity of winds from early - type stars ( corresponding to @xmath8 km s@xmath9 and @xmath10  yr@xmath9 ) , and @xmath11 is the speed of light .",
    "however , mechanical luminosity transfers energy to the interstellar medium ( ism ) more efficiently .",
    "a classical example is found in ob associations ( obas ) , which are composed of early - type massive stars that contain strong stellar winds , which in turn produce shock waves that sweep up the surrounding ism , creating a superbubble ( sb ) around the oba .",
    "the standard model @xcite describes these sbs as structures that consist of a shell of swept - up ism , cool and bright in optical emission lines , that contains shock - heated gas emitting x - rays in its interior .",
    "the standard model has been tested with observations of the kinematics and the x - ray emission of bubbles and superbubbles .",
    "of particular relevance are the studies of sbs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that have large - diameter shells , which in several cases are larger than predicted by the standard model . @xcite and @xcite found that most sbs had x - ray luminosities an order of magnitude higher than predicted by this model . nevertheless , there are superbubbles with luminosities consistent with the predictions of the standard model .",
    "@xcite based on observations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed two sb categories in terms of dynamical data : high - velocity and low - velocity superbubbles , latter type being more consistent with the standard model .",
    "@xcite concluded that x - ray emitting sbs with high expansion velocities and intermediate [ ] /[h @xmath12 line - ratios ( @xmath13 ) can not be explained by the mechanical energy of stellar winds alone , and must be associated with supernova explosions that occurred in their interiors .",
    "the energy released by the supernova explosion would be an additional source of heating for the gas inside the superbubble , which would explain the observed x - ray excess . at the same time , the explosion would produce an acceleration of the shell that could explain the high expansion velocities observed . in a previous work @xcite it has been confirmed the high expansion velocities in the models in which a supernova event has taken place . for instance , the gum nebula is a case in which a supernova explosion can explain the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite the detection of non - thermal radio emission is essential to have a definitive confirmation of the presence of a supernova remnant ( snr ) in the sb .    in this work",
    "we study two sbs belonging to the high - velocity type : the n70 and n185 ( both in the lmc ) .",
    "this characteristic makes these two superbubbles provide excellent laboratories in which to study the x - ray emission .",
    "the superbubble n70 ( dem l301 ) is an almost circular shell , about @xmath14 pc in diameter .",
    "it contains the oba lh  114 @xcite , with more than @xmath15 stellar sources ( the simbad astronomical database ) ; of these , seven are o - type stars @xcite .",
    "the mean age of this star association is about @xmath16 myr , a sufficient time for the first supernova explosion to occur . while radio observations are inconclusive about the non - thermal character of its radio continuum emission @xcite , a subsequent work by @xcite reported a spectral index @xmath17 which is larger than the typical @xmath18 value for snrs .",
    "observations in the optical and x - ray bands have found evidence of a supernova explosion inside the superbubble @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite obtained intermediate [ ] /[h@xmath12 line - ratios in n70 , larger than those typical of photoionized hii regions , but lower than those typical of snrs in the lmc .",
    "the range of values found in the outer filamentary shell is ( @xmath19 $ ] ) , are close to the range of excitation in some of the supernova remnants observed in the lmc @xcite .",
    "these line ratios can be explained by models with shock velocities of about @xmath20 km  s@xmath9 , in agreement with the measured expansion velocity of this superbubble .",
    "the high expansion velocity is in contradiction with the standard model ( oey et al .",
    "1996b ) . using archival data from the einstein observatory , @xcite reported an x - ray luminosity of n70 an order of magnitude higher than predicted by the classical wind - blown bubbles model .",
    "the superbubble n185 ( dem l25 ) is very similar to n70 .",
    "n185 has a spherical shape , with a diameter between @xmath21 and @xmath22 pc . @xcite",
    "measured an expansion velocity of @xmath23 km  s@xmath9 for this superbubble .",
    "n185 contains an ob association in its interior , consisting of more than 800 stellar sources ( the simbad astronomical database ) ; where only one is an o - type star @xcite .",
    "the likelihood that it had some additional massive stars in the past , along the high expansion velocity , and the intermediate [ ] /[h @xmath12 line - ratio @xcite suggest that this superbubble could have originated from a supernova explosion , or explosions .",
    "radio observations have reported a spectral index @xmath24 , which is typical of snr candidates @xcite .",
    "n185 was detected by rosat , with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath25  erg  s@xmath9 in @xcite ; this is higher than what is expected from standard model predictions .",
    "to unravel the origin of these high - velocity superbubbles , we will focus our attention to their x - ray emission , now observed with more sensitive instruments such as xmm - newton observatory .",
    "we selected these two sbs because of their high expansion velocities , their high [ ] /[h @xmath12 line - ratios , and their x - ray excess .",
    "a detailed study of the x - ray emission could help us to determine if stellar winds alone are the origin of the large diameter shells , or if supernovae are required to produce the large shells .",
    "if supernova explosions have occurred in their interiors , then the x - ray emission might allow us to determine the relative contributions to the bubble expansion from the stellar winds and from the supernova explosions .",
    "our study of diffuse x - ray emission from sbs n70 and n185 is made with archival data from xmm - newton observations .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in section 2 we present a brief overview to the theory of superbubbles .",
    "section 3 we present the data and describe its reduction .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are dedicated to the observational results for the sbs n70 and n185 , respectively .",
    "finally , in section 6 we give a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the standard model used to describe the structure of sbs is based on the original model of @xcite , which describes the structure produced by the interaction of a wind of a single star with its environment , and it was later extended to include the winds of several stars in a oba @xcite .",
    "the mechanical energy that the stars of the oba deposit to the ism in the form of stellar winds , is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mass - loss rate and the wind terminal velocity of the @xmath29th star , respectively , and @xmath30 is the total number of stars .",
    "the interaction of this winds with ism creates a superbubble structure with the following four regions ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) :    ]    * \\(a ) an inner zone where the stars are located and inject their winds .",
    "this region is delimited by the oba radius @xmath31 . outside this region",
    "a common oba wind is established . *",
    "\\(b ) a free - wind zone is the region between the oba radius and the reverse shock.this region is filled by the unperturbed stellar oba wind . *",
    "\\(c ) a shocked oba wind zone located between a reverse shock ( or inner shock ) and the contact discontinuity .",
    "* \\(d ) an external zone , between the contact discontinuity and the external shock .",
    "this region contains shocked ism material that has been swept by the external shock .    in zone",
    "a , stellar winds of the massive stars collide with each other , thermalizing all the gas injected inside the cluster volume forming a common oba wind for this to be possible @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radius of superbubble. the oba wind expands freely inside zone b. zone c is formed by gas of the stellar cluster wind that has been shocked by the inner or reverse shock .",
    "this outflow is thermalized and emits in soft x - ray energy range .",
    "finally , zone d is formed by shocked - ism gas emitting in optical ; it is the densest zone according to the standard model .",
    "this description corresponds to the intermediate stage of evolution of the superbubble , there are important radiative losses in the region ( d ) but in region ( c ) there are small ; and in the contact discontinuity that separates them thermal conduction transports heat due to the large temperature gradient between the regions ( c ) and ( d ) which have temperatures of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the equations that described the dynamics of the shell or region ( d ) according to the @xcite model are :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath33 and @xmath38 are the radius and expansion velocity of the sb ; where @xmath39 is the radius in units of pc , @xmath40 is the mechanical luminosity of the oba in units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath9 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number density of the ambient medium in units of @xmath44 and the age of the bubble in @xmath34 years , respectively .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a spherically symmeric gas distribution is given by the integral x - ray emissivity in the layer of shocked stellar wind region ( c) :    @xmath45    where @xmath33 is the radial coordinate , @xmath46 is the numerical density , and @xmath47 is the x - ray emissivity as a function of its temperature and metallicity .",
    "the x - ray luminosity that arises from the shocked gas ( zone c ) in the superbubble evolving inside a homogeneous ism can be estimated by integrating eq ( 4 ) from center to radius @xmath48 where the temperature drops to the minimum ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) . as presented by @xcite and @xcite , the integral",
    "can be written as :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the gas metallicity , and @xmath52 with @xmath53    the expression for the x - ray luminosity equation([eq5]) is practical because @xmath54 can be derived from physical parameters obteined from observations such as ism density , expansion velocity and the size of the sb , and the mechanical energy of the oba wind .",
    "superbubbles n70 and n185 were observed with the european photon imaging ca mera ( epic ) , on board of the xmm - newton observatory .",
    "epic consists of two metal oxide semi - conductor ( mos ) ccd arrays ( mos1 & mos2 , @xcite ) and a pn - ccd @xcite .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the epic mos cameras were operated in the prime full - window mode and the epic pn camera was operated in the extended prime full - window mode .",
    "two of the cameras contain seven mos ccds , while the third uses twelve pn ccds , defining a circular field of vision ( fov ) of @xmath55 in diameter , allowing the inclusion of the entire superbubbles ( sizes between @xmath56 ) in one pointing . in both observations ,",
    "a medium filter was used to block ultraviolet photons ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the xmm - newton pipeline products were processed using the xmm - newton science analysis software ( sas version 11.0.0 ) .",
    "since the emission from these superbubbles is extended , the data were processed with the xmm - newton extended source analysis software package ( xmm - esas ) @xcite for the analysis of epic mos and pn observations .",
    "xmm - esas documentation can be found at the sas package documentation web pages : _",
    "http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas/ current / howtousesas.shtml_. this package automatically filters times of high background contamination .",
    "the resulting effective exposure times are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "after filtering the event files , we created mosaic images of the epic cameras .",
    "we used the `` cheese '' task to identify points sources and remove them .",
    "the package includes tasks to create and model the non - cosmic background , correct the exposures and subtract the backgrounds .",
    "we generate combined images ( with a pixel size of 2.5@xmath57 ) of the epic cameras in the @xmath58)$ ]   kev bands ; there is no significant emission of the diffuse x - ray emission above 2.0 kev for both superbubbles . finally , they were smoothed as described in section 4.1 and 5.1 .",
    "a good background knowledge is crucial for the spectral analysis .",
    "for a point source , a local background extracted from a neighboring region can be used . in the case of a diffuse source , as in the case of sbs n 70 and n185 corresponding to an area of diffuse x - ray emission that covers one third of the xmm - newton fov filling entirely ccd#1 or the central ccd of epic mos ,",
    "it is inappropriate to estimate the local background from the same data ; many effects can be produced due to differences in chip position .",
    "the high - energy particles that interact with material surrounding the detector produce fluorescence , which varies with position on the detector , especially for the pn detector .",
    "in addition , the spectral response depends on the position on the detector . to estimate the background of diffuse sources , the xmm - newton epic background working group has created the so called blank sky data for each epic @xcite .",
    "the blank sky data have been merged with data from different pointings after the point sources were eliminated .",
    "this data set consists in the detector background and an average cosmic x - ray background . in this paper",
    "we used the blank sky data obtained by xmm - newton epic background working group ( request i d : 0573 - 0575 ) in the direction of the sbs n70 and n185 .    before extracting the spectra ,",
    "we have first corrected both the observed data and the blank sky data for vignetting using the xmmsas command evigweight .",
    "the spectra of the diffuse x - ray emission from n70 and n185 were extracted from the event files of the epic cameras .",
    "these spectra were extracted from a circular region encompassing the entire superbubble , while the background spectrum is extracted from the blank sky data at the same location on the detector as the source spectrum . for this",
    "we use the script skycast , which converts the detector coordinates of the xmm epic background into sky coordinates , using the pointing direction of the observation .",
    "finally , the spectra are grouped with a minimum of 25 counts / bin .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a mosaic of images in the @xmath58)$ ]   kev energy band in the direction of sb n70 .",
    "the top - left panel displays a combined epic mos1/2 and pn fov image , which have been obtained by using the task _ comb_. the top - right panel shows the combined epic smoothed ( with a kernel of @xmath59 counts ) image , with a size of @xmath60 , where the non - cosmic background was subtracted and the exposure has been corrected .",
    "besides , several point sources have been identified and removed from this observation , which are indicated by small circular voids in this image .",

    "we note that the soft x - ray emission is well - confined within the h@xmath65 shell .",

    "we conducted a detailed study based on xmm - newton data of the sbs n70 and n185 , in the lmc .",
    "we have generated both x - ray images and spectra of these objects . in both sbs , we find soft diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "soft x - ray emission comes from the inner region of the sbs ( i.e. , interior to the optical shells ) .",
    "our results show thermal spectra from sbs which are associated with the soft x - ray emission .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , there is an analytical model that aims to explain the soft x - ray emission from bubbles and superbubbles @xcite , and has become the standard model for sbs . according to this model ,",

    "( see table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the x - ray luminosity predicted by the standard model is four times lower than the observed values for n70 , and @xmath96 times lower than observed for n185 . in",
    "this cases the standard model of wind - blown bubbles can not explain the observed soft x - ray emission of these sbs .    in a previous work ,",
    "@xcite carried out numerical models of the sb evolution applied to n70 .",
    "as does the standard model , their models predict that the primary x - ray emission will be in the soft x - ray band and that it has a thermal origin ( @xmath97  k ) . in that work",
    "several models were performed in order to reproduce the soft x - ray luminosity , the high expansion velocity and the large radius of this superbubble . the model including both a supernova explosion ( absent in the standard model of @xcite ) and the stellar winds fits quite well with the kinematics of the optical shell , and the excess of thermal x - ray emission of n70 .",
    "an x - ray luminosity of @xmath98  erg  s@xmath9 was obtained for this model , a value that agrees with the observed x - ray luminosity obtained for n70 in this paper ( see table [ tab4 ] ) .    for n185 ,",
    "the same arguments can be employed to justify the inclusion of a supernova , and indeed , non - thermal radio emission has been detected as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "a supernova explosion is also consistent with the stellar population models for n70 and n185 presented by @xcite , in which 13 and 15 massive stars , respectively , are found between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "a   @xmath101 star could be expected using a standard initial mass function for both superbubbles and , if formed with the rest of the cluster , it would already have exploded as an sn .",
    "thus , the kinematics , the size and the excess soft x - ray emission of these sbs can be explained by a sn exploding in a wind - blown sb .",
