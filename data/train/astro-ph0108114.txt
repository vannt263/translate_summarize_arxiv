    "ngc  4636 is one of the nearest and , at @xmath22@xmath3 , one of the most x - ray luminous `` normal '' ellipticals .",
    "ngc  4636 lies in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , 10  or 2.6 mpc on the sky to the south of m87 , for a distance to ngc  4636 of 15 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) . as found for most luminous , slowly rotating ellipticals , the optical surface brightness of ngc  4636 flattens in the inner regions .",
    "the central region , as seen in short exposures and with hst , has low eccentricity and is classed as an e0 .",
    "however , as noted by sandage ( 1961 ) , at low surface brightness the galaxy is flattened ( e4 ) .",
    "ngc 4636 has ionized gas in its core , but is unusual in that the gas velocities are uncorrelated with and significantly larger than those of the stars ( caon , macchetto & pastoriza , 2000 ) . a weak , extended radio source ( @xmath4 )",
    "is observed at the galaxy center ( birkinshaw & davies 1985 , stanger & warwick 1986 ) , while loewenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ) place an upper limit of @xmath5 on nuclear x - ray emission .",
    "einstein x - ray images first showed that , like other luminous elliptical galaxies , ngc  4636 was surrounded by an extensive hot gas corona ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "while einstein observations allowed only an emission - weighted temperature to be determined , with rosat and asca , a modest increase in the gas temperature with radius was found , abundances in the halo were measured and a very extended x - ray component was detected ( awaki et al .",
    "1994 , trinchieri et al .",
    "1994 , matsushita et al .",
    "1997 , finoguenov & jones 2000 , buote 2000 ) . from an einstein hri observation ,",
    "stanger & warwick ( 1986 ) found an asymmetric gas distribution that they suggested could be the result of erratic large scale gas flows .",
    "the chandra observatory allows us to study the structure of the x - ray halo around ngc  4636 with a limiting resolution of @xmath650 pc . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of acis observations that reveal unusual structures in the x - ray halo and describe a possible mechanism for producing these features .",
    "ngc  4636 was observed with acis - s for 53 ksec on 26 - 27 january 2000 ( obsid 323 ) and with acis - i for 11 ksec on 4 - 5 december , 1999 ( obsid 324 ) .",
    "we filtered the observations by selecting asca grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 and eliminating intervals of high background ( `` flares '' ) as well as bright columns or pixels due to instrumental effects or cosmic ray afterglows .",
    "the remaining `` good '' times are 41286 seconds in the acis - s observation and 5989 seconds in the acis - i observation .",
    "1 shows the region of the acis - s3 ccd centered on ngc4636 in the energy range from 0.5 to 2.0 kev .",
    "this image shows a bright central region surrounded by armlike structures . at a distance of 15",
    "mpc , these structures are observed to extend @xmath68 kpc from the galaxy center . while the features toward the northeast and southwest are the brightest and appear symmetric around the galaxy center , the acis - s image shows a third , fainter arm northwest of the galaxy , that shares symmetries with the two brighter x - ray arms .",
    "in particular the sharp edges along the bright southwest and faint northwest arms define a parabola that also traces the southeast edge of the bright galaxy core .",
    "part of this parabola is mirrored in the bright ne arm .",
    "in addition to these features , fig .  1 shows structure in the eastern part of the halo .",
    "in particular east of the galaxy center is a low surface brightness region , with 1  elongated regions of enhanced emission marking its northeast and southeast boundaries . on smaller scales , as fig .",
    "2 shows , the x - ray emission in the galaxy core is elliptical ( position angle @xmath6320 ) and has a 10  long by 1  wide `` gap '' running north - south , where the surface brightness is about half that in the adjacent regions .    to better define the halo structures , we generated a radial profile of the x - ray emission excluding the brighter regions noted above , as well as point sources , and used this profile to produce a smooth , radially symmetric , nonparametric two dimensional model for the surface brightness . fig .",
    "1 ( right ) shows the result of subtracting this model from the image on the left and smoothing the remaining emission .",
    "most prominent in this figure are the enhanced regions of emission and the cavities to the east and west of the nucleus .    fig .",
    "1 also shows extended x - ray emission that is brighter to the west of the galaxy .",
    "this is likely the very extended emission found from rosat and asca observations ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1994 and matsushita et al .",
    "although this extended emission was suggested to be symmetric around ngc 4636 , the extended emission in the chandra acis - s image ( and in the acis - i image ) is brighter west of the galaxy .    to study the bright armlike structures , we generated surface brightness distributions across the ne and sw arms and measured the gas temperature in several regions along and across these arms .",
    "as an example , fig .  3 ( left ) shows the x - ray surface brightness distribution projected along a rectangle ( @xmath7 ) centered 65from the nucleus and aligned parallel to the `` leading '' edge of the sw arm . as suggested in fig .  1 ,",
    "the projections show that the `` leading '' edges are remarkably sharp .",
    "both arms show changes in brightness by about a factor of two on scales of a few arcseconds .",
    "the surface brightness falls more gradually toward the trailing edge .    to measure the gas temperature in these features , and throughout ngc  4636 , we first identified and excluded regions around 127 point sources in the acis - s3 ccd",
    ". to identify sources we generated a 0.5 to 2.0 kev image without filtering for background flares .",
    "chandra s excellent angular resolution results in small `` cells '' for point sources , particularly near the telescope aim point .",
    "thus for point source detection , the benefit of the longer exposure time gained by including times of high background outweighs the modest increase in the local background .",
    "we omitted point sources with at least nine counts .",
    "we also examined a `` harder '' 2.0 - 5.0 kev image to insure that no highly absorbed sources were missed .",
    "we extracted spectra for a variety of regions from the `` cleaned image '' and fit these using xspec over the energy range from 0.5 to 3 kev .",
    "although the focus of this paper is on the features in the hot halo , we first comment on the overall temperature structure . for several regions within the central bright core , we measured gas temperatures of 0.5 kev ( with 90% uncertainties less than 0.03 kev ) .",
    "outside the central region , we observe a gradual rise in temperature from 0.5 to 0.7 kev within a radius of three arcminutes .",
    "this is consistent with the modest rise in temperature with radius reported from rosat .",
    "for the ne and sw arms , we measured the gas temperature both along and across these features . along the arms",
    ", we found the same increase in gas temperature from 0.5 to 0.7 kev observed elsewhere in the halo . to reduce any biases that this radial temperature change could produce in looking for tempera-    ture changes across the arms , we extracted the spectra across each arm in two regions , centered @xmath8 and @xmath9 from the galaxy center . for each region , we extracted spectra in a series of rectangles ( @xmath10 by @xmath11 ) whose long sides were parallel to the sharp edge of each arm .",
    "for the arm regions closer to the galaxy center , where the halo emission is bright , we found no significant changes in the gas temperature across the arms .",
    "in particular , in the inner spectral regions of the ne arm , the best fit temperatures range from 0.57 to 0.65 kev ( with 90% uncertainties of 0.05 kev ) , while in the sw inner arm , the best fit temperatures range from 0.60 to 0.68 kev .",
    "however , in the outer region of the sw arm , the spectra show significant changes in the gas temperature across the arm ( see fig .  3 right ) . for this region of the sw arm ,",
    "if we take the temperature measurement south of the edge as the ambient temperature and fit the temperature in the arm with two components , one fixed at the temperature and normalization of the ambient region , the temperature of the second component is @xmath12 kev . in the ne arm , the temperature measured in the rectangle along the leading edge of the arm had the highest temperature ( @xmath13 kev ) , but this was not significantly higher than in other regions .",
    "the smaller and less significant temperature changes in the ne arm may be due to contamination from emission from the other structures in the eastern part of the halo .",
    "while the x - ray features in ngc 4636 are so far unique , they share properties with structures seen in the hot gas in other galaxies and in clusters .",
    "the symmetric , parabolic regions of brighter emission resemble the x - ray bright filaments observed around the radio lobes in the elliptical galaxy m84 ( finoguenov and jones 2000 ) and in the hydra a and perseus clusters ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 , fabian et al .",
    "however in ngc  4636 , no large radio lobes are observed .",
    "in addition while the sharpness of the edges of the ne and sw arms appears similar to the sharp edges found along `` fronts '' in clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 , vikhlinin et al . 2001 ) , the cluster `` fronts '' are cold , while those in ngc  4636 are hot .    while the presence of sharp fronts suggests the possibility of an ongoing merger , the east - west symmetry of the halo structures , the similarity of this structure to that seen around radio lobes , as well as the lack of a disturbed morphology in the stellar core or in the stellar velocities ( caon et al .",
    "2000 ) led us to consider a nuclear outburst as the underlying cause .",
    "in particular we interpret the bright sw arm , the fainter nw arm and the bright ne arm as the projected edges of paraboloidal shock fronts expanding about an east  west axis through the nucleus .",
    "a shock model is also consistent with the evacuated cavities to the east and west of the central region ( fig  1 right ) .        with this interpretation",
    ", we used the size as well as the surface brightness and temperature measurements of the sw arm to constrain a simple shock model . from our spectral measurements of the sw arm ,",
    "the gas outside the arm has an ambient temperature @xmath14 kev . taking the 1 kev temperature of the second spectral component in the sw arm as the postshock temperature",
    ", we can estimate the strength of the shock .",
    "such a temperature jump by a factor of 1.75 arises from a shock having a density jump of a factor of 2 .",
    "the corresponding pressure jump is a factor of 3.5 and the mach number is 1.73 , giving a shock velocity of 725 km s@xmath15 .",
    "we computed the evolution of a shock front produced by a point explosion of @xmath16 ergs in a uniform density gas .",
    "the state of this model is completely determined by the strength of the shock .",
    "we chose a time when the density jump is a factor of two for comparison with the observations . in our model , the surface brightness profile is determined by embedding the shocked region in a uniform cube of unshocked gas .",
    "the size of this cube relative to the size of the shocked region determines the amount of emission from unshocked gas , and hence the size of the jump in surface brightness across the shock front .",
    "the length of the cube , @xmath17 , is determined as the depth of gas , with the density of 0.012 @xmath18 measured at @xmath19 from the nucleus , that gives the observed surface brightness at this radius .",
    "using beta model parameters for the undisturbed gas measured from the x - ray surface brightness profile ( @xmath20 , core radius @xmath21 ) gives @xmath22 ( 10.4 kpc ) . at a radius of 65 , the diameter of the shocked region in ngc 4636 is @xmath23 , so the ratio of @xmath17 to the shock radius is @xmath24 . with this value",
    ", we obtain the surface brightness distribution across the shock shown in fig .",
    "we note that the shape of the shock front is not sensitive to the shock strength .",
    "the agreement between the surface brightness profiles derived from the observations and from the model supports our interpretation of these features as shock fronts .",
    "closer to the galaxy , where the preshock pressure is greater , the shock would be weaker with a smaller temperature jump .",
    "this may account for the lack of an observed temperature jump in the inner arm regions .",
    "our analysis assumes that the symmetry axis of the shocks lies in the plane of the sky .",
    "however , as shown in fig  1 and 2 , close to the center of the galaxy , the bright rim of the western parabola can be traced to the southeast of the nucleus , while the edge of the eastern parabola can be traced to the northwest of the nucleus .",
    "this overlap of the bases of the parabolas ( the shock fronts ) implies that the symmetry axis can not be exactly in the plane of the sky . to determine the axis orientation",
    ", we would need the intrinsic shape of the shocked regions .",
    "this is constrained by the agreement between the observed and model shock profiles , and by the expectation that the shocked regions are not highly elongated .",
    "both suggest that the symmetry axis is not far from the plane of the sky , but detailed modelling is needed to constrain this further .",
    "both the size and symmetry of the apparent shocks point immediately to the nucleus as their energy source . scaling from our simple model ,",
    "the age of the shocks is @xmath25 years and the total energy driving them is @xmath26 ergs .",
    "this implies a modest mean nuclear output of @xmath27 .",
    "however the absence of either strong x - ray or radio emission suggests that the agn output is not constant over time .",
    "if the power of the outburst were near the eddington limit for a @xmath28 black hole ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , then the required energy could be released in only @xmath29 years .",
    "this raises the possibility of very brief periods of quasar rebirth .",
    "we suggest that the other emission features in ngc  4636 s eastern halo originated from another nuclear outburst . the east - west asymmetry may result from projection effects or because the shocks have broken through to the east , but so far have been confined by the denser medium west of the galaxy .",
    "such outbursts could cause the large chaotic velocities found in the emission line gas .",
    "the narrow waist in the shocked region close to the nucleus suggests , in the simplest interpretation , that the energy driving the shocks was injected off - center , possibly via jets . although the shape of the shocked regions favors off - center injection , the presence of only a weak , small - scale radio source in ngc 4636 argues against jets .",
    "alternatively , since the speed of a strong shock is @xmath30 , if the unshocked gas is sufficiently dense close to the plane of the nucleus ( perpendicular to the symmetry axis ) , then energy injected close to the nucleus can be channeled to produce shocks of this general shape .",
    "in fact , there is no real distinction between these ; it is simply a matter of how far from the nucleus the energy is injected .",
    "the hot gas in the centers of elliptical galaxies has a high density and thus a short cooling time .",
    "when the gas cools appreciably it forms a dense disk due to rotation ( brighenti and mathews 2000 ) .",
    "if this cooled gas fuels a nuclear outburst that deposits energy close to the nucleus , the presence of the dense disk would channel the energy and produce shocks like those observed in ngc 4636 .",
    "thus ngc 4636 appears to demonstrate the energy feedback process invoked to prevent the deposition of large quantities of cooled gas in the centers of galaxies and clusters ( tabor & binney 1993 , churazov et al .",
    "2001 , david et al .",
    "2001 ) . in a galaxy with the x - ray luminosity of ngc  4636",
    ", outbursts would need to occur every @xmath31 y to prevent the accumulation of a significant amount of cooled gas . if outbursts causing shocks occur every @xmath32 ",
    "@xmath33 y , then ngc  4636 and other ellipticals could be in this shock phase 1  10% of the time .",
    "if the outburst is fueled by cooled gas , then the repetition time must equal the central cooling time of the hot gas following an outburst",
    ". a typical elliptical galaxy , with a central cooling time of a @xmath34 years , would be about half way through this cycle .",
    "we recall that ngc  4636 s x - ray luminosity is unusually high for its absolute magnitude compared to other early type galaxies , ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "this high x - ray luminosity may be due to the advanced state of cooling that brought on the outburst , and may be further enhanced by the shocks .",
    "when the gas halo returns to hydrostatic equilibrium , its x - ray luminosity could decline by an order of magnitude or more , in which case the estimated outburst intervals would be much less frequent .",
    "such excursions in x - ray luminosity would help explain the broad @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath36 relation for elliptical galaxies .",
    "interactions between radio sources and the hot interstellar and intergalactic medium in elliptical galaxies and clusters have been observed in a number of systems , e.g. cen a ( kraft et al . 1999 ) , m84 ( finoguenov & jones 2000 ) , perseus ( bohringer et al .",
    "1993 ) , hydra a ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ) , and a2052 ( blanton et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , in these examples , the main observational characteristic is displacement of hot gas by the radio emitting lobes , while in approximate pressure equilibrium with the gas . in ngc 4636",
    "we see evidence for a nuclear outburst , but no large radio lobes and only a relatively weak ( 10@xmath37 ) central radio source .",
    "we suggest that the more common x - ray and radio lobe structures ( e.g. m84 ) represent a later stage of the process seen in ngc  4636 .",
    "this raises the issue of whether the nuclear outbursts that provide significant heating are primarily radio outbursts , or whether radio outbursts occur in a phase following such an outburst .",
    "the latter scenario is consistent with the modest ratio of jet mechanical power to radio power found in hydra a ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) .    in summary",
    ", the chandra image shows new features in the x - ray halo of ngc  4636 that can be explained as the results of shocks produced by nuclear outbursts .",
    "we suggest ngc 4636 is an example of the feedback process that prevents the deposition of significant amounts of cold gas by cooling flows .",
    "the lack of extended radio jets or lobes suggests that the energy from the agn may be released by some more direct process , rather than via a radio outburst .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating discussions with e. churazov , r. mushotzky , and h. donnelly .",
