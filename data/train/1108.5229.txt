    "over the past decade , deep x - ray observations of significant substructure in the hot gas near the centers of rich clusters have revolutionized our understanding of the evolution of clusters and the galaxies at their cores .",
    "sharp surface brightness discontinuities ( edges ) are found where the increase in density across the discontinuity is accompanied by a decrease in temperature , opposite to that expected from shocks .",
    "these ` cold fronts ' provide evidence for an ongoing subcluster merger or non - hydrostatic motions of the gas ( ` sloshing ' ) from a prior disturbance in the core ( see , e.g. the review by markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , episodic outbursts from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at the centers of the dominant galaxies in groups and clusters , are revealed by outflow shocks and x - ray cavities ( deficits in x - ray surface brightness ) in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ( see , e.g. fabian et  al .",

    "2005 for m87 in the virgo cluster ) .",
    "these x - ray cavities correspond to regions where the hot cluster gas has been evacuated by jets from agn outbursts and the interior of the cavity ( bubble ) is filled with radio plasma .",
    "after an initial momentum driven formation stage , the bubble of radio plasma rises buoyantly in the group / cluster atmosphere .",
    "this feedback between the central agn and its environment may be key to resolving the cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters , and and may be an essential ingredient in the emerging models for the coevolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ( e.g. best et  al .  2006 ; croton et  al .",

    "the more complex spectral structure for gas in the north rim compared to that in the south rim region may be due to projection effects , such that multi - phase gas is more prominent along our line of sight to the north than to the south .",

    "the first two bands are chosen to divide the energies containing the fel line complex ( the fe peak from @xmath294kev ) in half , such that the hardness ratio constructed from these bands will be sensitive to shifts in the energy of the peak emission from the fel complex , caused by temperature differences in cool ( @xmath141kev ) gas . for comparison , we also include net source counts in these energy bands for the north and south rims .",
    "notice that in all cases ( knots and rims ) , the x - ray emission is dominated by the fe peak , confirming that the x - ray emitting gas is cool , and , for all the knot - like features except knot@xmath11 , the net photon counts above @xmath75kev are consistent with zero at the @xmath295 confidence level . since the number of photons in each individual knot is small , we use the hardness ratio across the iron peak , @xmath296 , to search for temperature differences between the individual knots and between the knots and the rims .",

    "although the hardness ratios for knot@xmath109 and knot@xmath2 suggest a mildly softer spectrum than the others , the most striking result from table [ tab : hardratio ] is that the hardness ratios of the knots are nearly identical to that of the rims .",

    "for example if they are filamentary rather than spherical , i.e. more like the x - ray filament observed in m87 ( forman et  al .",
    "2007 ) but viewed with the filament oriented along the line of sight , the emission volume would be larger , implying a lower electron density and allowing the structure to be closer to or in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings . then the knot - like appearance of the structures would be primarily a projection effect",
    ". it may be difficult to explain , however , why all the knots would have this orientation .",
    "the second possibility is that the pressure estimates are , in fact , roughly correct and the knots and surrounding features are the visible result of a strong shock being driven into the ambient gas by the supersonic inflation of the radio lobe .",
    "the general morphology of the rim and knots is similar to the high mach number shocks seen in ngc 4552 ( machacek et al 2006 ) and her a ( nulsen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there is a noticeably bright , roughly elliptical , enhancement associated with the radio lobes in both cases .",
    "the morphology of the knots and the rim looks similar , albeit at much lower signal to noise .",
    "the knotty morphology could be the result of a shock being driven into a multi - phase ism . in this scenario ,",
    "the knots are the result of cooler clouds embedded in a hotter medium .",
    "a shock driven through such a stratified medium will drive spherical shocks into the clouds .",
    "they are brighter because they are denser , while the post - shock gas must be in rough pressure equilibrium .",
    "we can use the density between the rim and the pre - shocked gas in the rankine - hugoniot conditions to estimate the mach number of the shock and the expected temperature increase in the rim ( landau & lifschitz 1959 ) . assuming the bubble rims are spherical shells and that the preshock density is given by our mean @xmath97-model from  [ sec : slosh ] evaluated at the midpoint of the rim",
    ", we can use the density jump between the rim and the pre - shocked gas in the rankine - huygenot conditions to estimate a shock mach number . from the more complete northern rim",
    ", we find a density jump of @xmath312 , and mach number @xmath313 .",
    "however , the rankine - huygenot conditions assume the shock front is thin .",
    "our measured value for the density jump is an average value across the rim , and so will underestimate the true density jump at the shock front . thus this inferred mach number should be interpreted as a lower bound on the true mach number for the shock .",
    "these averaged values for the north rim in ngc5846 are similar to those measured for bubbles in the central region of ngc4552 , where more detailed modeling indicated a shock mach number of @xmath314 ( machacek et  al .",
    "the measured ( projected ) temperature jump across the northern rim in ngc5846 ( @xmath315 ) is expected to be smaller than the rankine - hugoniot prediction ( @xmath313 ) due to dilution by emission from unshocked gas along the line of sight .",

    "ngc5846a was among the earliest galaxies confirmed to be a compact elliptical galaxy ( ce ) .",
    "compact elliptical galaxies form a rare class of early type galaxies that share many of the unusual properties of m32 , companion to m31 ( andromeda ) in the local group ( faber 1973 ) .",
    "compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxies have low optical luminosities ( @xmath318 ) , similar to the more common dwarf elliptical galaxies , but their half - light radii ( @xmath319kpc ) are several times smaller , such that their optical surface brightness is much higher than expected for their luminosity ( e.g. faber 1973 ; smith castelli et  al .  2008 ; chiligarian et  al .",
    "all are found near massive companions .",
    "they also tend to have higher stellar velocity dispersions and higher metallicities than expected for their luminosities , and lie above the locus of normal dwarf elliptical galaxies on the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "currently only about a dozen ce galaxies have been found within @xmath320mpc , where their properties can be confirmed by ground - based telescopes ( for recent searches see smith - castelli et  al .  2008 , 2010 in the antlia cluster ; price et  al .",
    "2009 in coma ; chiligarian & bergond 2010 in the ngc5846 group ) .",
    "while the origin of ce galaxies and their relationship to galaxy evolution remain under debate , the most likely explanation for their high surface brightness , high velocity dispersion and compact structure is that their progenitors were massive , possibly disky , galaxies that have undergone severe tidal threshing from interactions with a nearby massive companion .",
    "the outer stellar layers have been tidally stripped from these galaxies leaving only the compact stellar core ( bekki et  al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "the near - infrared indices for ngc5846a suggest that the progenitor of ngc5846a may have been a massive elliptical galaxy , and that the catastrophic tidal interaction , responsible for stripping @xmath321 of its progenitor s stellar mass , may also have funneled gas into ngc5846a s core , resulting in an intermediate age population of stars near its nucleus ( davidge et  al .",
    ".    one might expect such strong tidal interactions would also remove any hot gas corona associated with the compact elliptical galaxy , leaving it devoid of x - ray emitting gas .",

    "since the radial velocity difference between ngc5846a and ngc5846 is @xmath324kms@xmath14(ned ) , already transonic for @xmath325kev gas , the infall is likely supersonic . assuming a thermal model with @xmath326kev , uniform filling and cylindrical geometry for the tail , the mean density of gas in the tail is estimated to be @xmath327@xmath111and mass in the tail of @xmath328 . the average mass return rate for a simple population of stars in a galaxy of age @xmath329 , where @xmath329 is the end of the galaxy formation epoch and stars are passively evolving , is @xmath330 ( ciotti et  al .",

    "the time between stripping episodes needed to replenish the ism with sufficient mass to explain the gas mass observed in the tail is @xmath334myr .",
    "the central x - ray corona in ngc5846a has a radius @xmath335 , also of the order of the chandra point spread function .",

    "these multiple surface brightness edges are likely the signature of non - hydrostatic gas motions ( sloshing ) caused by the off - axis encounter of ngc5846 with another group galaxy , possibly the large spiral ngc5850 , or a merging subgroup . *",
