    "many open problems related to nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) of mathematical physics concern the extreme behavior which can be exhibited to their solutions . by this we mean , among other , questions concerning the maximum possible growth of certain norms of the solution of the pde . from the physics point of view",
    ", these norms measure different properties of the solution , such as generation of small scales in the case of the sobolev norms .",
    "the question of the maximum possible growth of solution norms is also intrinsically linked to the problem of existence of solutions to pde problems in a given functional space .",
    "more specifically , the loss of regularity of a solution resulting from the formation of singularities usually manifests itself in an unbounded growth of some solution norms in finite time , typically referred to as `` blow - up '' .",
    "while problems of this type remain open for many important pdes of mathematical physics , most attention has been arguably given to establishing the regularity of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) navier - stokes equations @xcite , a problem which has been recognized by the clay mathematics institute as one of its `` millennium problems '' @xcite .",
    "analogous questions also remain open for the 3d inviscid euler equation @xcite .",
    "the problem we address in the present study is how the transient growth of solutions to certain nonlinear pdes is affected by the presence of noise represented by a suitably defined stochastic forcing term in the equation .",
    "more specifically , the key question is whether via some interaction with the nonlinearity such stochastic forcing may enhance or weaken the growth of certain solution norms as compared to the deterministic case . in particular , in the case of systems exhibiting finite - time blow - up in the deterministic case",
    "it is interesting to know whether noise may accelerate or delay the formation of a singularity , or perhaps even prevent it entirely @xcite .",
    "these questions are of course nuanced by the fact that they may be considered either for individual trajectories or in suitable statistical terms .",
    "we add that transient growth in linear stochastic systems is well understood @xcite and here we focus on the interaction of the stochastic forcing with a particular type of nonlinearity .",
    "since this study is ultimately motivated by questions concerning extreme behavior in hydrodynamic models , we will focus our attention on the simplest model used in this context , namely , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) stochastic burgers equation defined on a periodic interval @xmath2 $ ]    [ eq : burgers ] @xmath3\\times(0,1 ) , \\label{eq : burgersa } \\\\",
    "u(t,0)=u(t,1 ) \\ \\text{and } \\",
    "\\partial_x u(t,0 ) & = \\partial_x u(t,1 ) \\qquad & & \\text{for } \\ t\\in[0,t],\\label{eq : burgersb } \\\\",
    "u(0,x)&=g(x ) & & \\text{for } \\ x\\in(0,1 ) , \\label{eq : burgersc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath4 represents the length of the time window of interest , @xmath5 is the viscosity coefficient ( hereafter we will use @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the initial condition , where @xmath8 denotes the sobolev space of periodic functions defined on @xmath9 with square integrable derivatives and the norm given by @xcite @xmath10 for simplicity we will denote the time - space domain @xmath11 \\times ( 0,1)$ ] ( `` @xmath12 '' means `` equal to by definition '' ) . in equation the stochastic forcing is given by a random field @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , at any point @xmath15 our solution becomes a random variable @xmath16 for @xmath17 in some probability space @xmath18 .",
    "we add that , while for other systems , such as e.g.  the schrdinger equation @xcite , one may also consider multiplicative noise , for models of the type one typically studies additive noise .    a common approach to modelling stochastic excitation in pde systems",
    "is to describe it in terms of gaussian white noise associated with an infinite - variance wiener process .",
    "however , as will be discussed in section [ sec : noise ] and appendix [ sec : white ] , such noise model does not ensure that individual solutions are well defined in the sobolev space @xmath19 and is therefore not suitable for the problem considered here .",
    "thus , for the remainder of this paper , we shall restrict our attention to the case where @xmath20 is the derivative of a wiener process with finite variance , which is the most `` aggressive '' stochastic excitation still leaving problem well - posed in @xmath19 ( precise definition is deferred to section [ sec : noise ] ) .",
    "we add that the stochastic burgers equation may be regarded as a special case of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation which has received some attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "we now briefly summarize important results from the literature relevant to the stochastic burgers equation .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of solutions has been proven in @xcite for the problem posed on the real line and in @xcite for a bounded domain with dirichlet boundary conditions . in all cases ,",
    "solutions can be regarded as continuous @xmath21-valued random processes . for the bounded domain ( the case which we are interested in )",
    ", convergence of numerical schemes has been established in @xcite for the finite - difference approaches and in @xcite for galerkin approximations . however , in both cases only dirichlet boundary conditions were considered . the case with the periodic boundary conditions has been recently considered in @xcite for a larger class of burgers - type equations and an abstract numerical scheme .    given its significance in hydrodynamics @xcite , the key quantity of interest in our study will be the @xmath0 seminorm of the solution referred to as _ enstrophy _",
    "@xmath22 in the deterministic setting ( @xmath23 in ) , where burgers equation is known to be globally well - posed @xcite , its solutions generically exhibit a steepening of the gradients ( driven by the nonlinearity ) followed by their viscous dissipation when the linear dissipative term starts to dominate .",
    "this behavior is manifested by an initial growth of enstrophy @xmath24 , which peaks when the solution @xmath25 builds up the steepest front , followed by its eventual decay to zero . as a point of reference",
    ", we illustrate this generic behavior in figure [ fig : det ] in which the results were obtained by solving system with @xmath23 , @xmath26 and an `` extreme '' initial condition @xmath27 designed to produce a maximum enstrophy growth over @xmath2 $ ] for a given @xmath28 ( the numerical approach used to obtain the results in figure [ fig : det ] and the construction of the extreme initial data @xmath27 will be described in sections [ sec : numer ] and [ sec : results ] , respectively ) .",
    "although the evolution shown in figure [ fig : det ] corresponds to a special choice of the initial data , it is qualitatively similar to the generic case .    .45   and ( b ) history of the enstrophy @xmath24 in a solution of the deterministic burgers equation with an extreme initial condition @xmath27 . in figure ( a )",
    "the level sets of @xmath29 are plotted with increments of 0.1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .45   and ( b ) history of the enstrophy @xmath24 in a solution of the deterministic burgers equation with an extreme initial condition @xmath27 . in figure ( a ) the level sets of @xmath29 are plotted with increments of 0.1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for deterministic systems which exhibit blow - up , singularity formation is typically signalled by unbounded growth of certain sobolev norms @xcite .",
    "this growth can often be estimated using bounds obtained with methods of functional analysis .",
    "therefore , even for problems which are globally well - posed such as the viscous burgers equation , it is important to understand how much the enstrophy @xmath24 can grow depending on the `` size '' of the initial data @xmath30 , as this can provide valuable insights concerning the sharpness of the corresponding estimates .",
    "these issues are at the heart of the recently undertaken research program aiming to probe the sharpness of fundamental estimates on the growth of quadratic quantities in hydrodynamic models @xcite .",
    "these estimates are of two types , namely , concerning the instantaneous growth ( i.e. , the rate of change at a fixed instant of time ) and growth over finite time windows .",
    "important progress has also been made on some related questions in the context of the 3d navier - stokes problem @xcite which is in fact what has motivated this research program .",
    "on the other hand , to the best of our knowledge , no such estimates are available for the largest possible growth of solution norms , either instantaneously or over finite time , in the corresponding stochastic pde models . in this area",
    "most of the research has been focused on the long - time behavior and behavior averaged with respect to time , as surveyed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "questions concerning how noise can regularize potentially singular solutions began to be investigated relatively recently and we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite for a survey of recent analytical results .",
    "some additional results can also be found in @xcite for the heat equation and in @xcite for more general systems . while most of the literature concerns analysis , one of the first computational studies of the effect of noise on singularity formation was @xcite in the context of the schrdinger equation . among other findings",
    ", it demonstrated that the effect of the stochastic excitation depends on the precise definition of the noise in the equation .      so that we can state the questions addressed in this study in precise terms , below we introduce some useful notation .",

    "the main question we address here is how the growth of the enstrophy described by stochastic system , both in terms of individual trajectories and statistical properties , depends on the properties of the noise term in equation , in particular , whether this growth is enhanced or weakened in comparison to the growth observed in the deterministic system @xcite , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : det ] .",
    "we have made the following observations :    * samples of the stochastic solution tend to exhibit a larger growth of enstrophy than the deterministic solution , * when the noise magnitude is sufficiently large relative to the initial enstrophy @xmath1 , the dynamics of sample solutions is entirely dominated by noise and exhibits little effect of the initial data , * when the noise magnitude is small relative to the initial enstrophy , solution samples can be regarded as `` perturbations '' of the deterministic evolution with enstrophy growth dependent on @xmath1 , * the enstrophy growth @xmath81}\\e(u(t))$ ] in the deterministic case provides * * an upper bound for the growth of the enstrophy of the expected value @xmath81}\\e({\\mathbb{e}}[u(t)])$ ] , and * * a lower bound for the growth of the expected value of the enstrophy @xmath81}{\\mathbb{e}}[\\e(u(t))]$ ] , * when the noise magnitude increases proportionally to the initial enstrophy @xmath1 , the same growth of the expected value of the enstrophy is observed as in the deterministic case ; this leads us to conclude that inclusion of stochastic forcing does not trigger any new mechanisms of enstrophy amplification .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided as follows : in the next section we describe our model of noise and discuss some properties of the stochastic solutions ; the numerical approach is introduced in section [ sec : numer ] , whereas the computational results are presented and discussed in section [ sec : results ] ; conclusions are presented in section [ sec : final ] , whereas some technical material is deferred to two appendices .",
    "as is customary in the standard theory of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) , we write the stochastic burgers equation in the differential form @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 in which @xmath84 is a constant and @xmath85 is a cylindrical wiener process . in other words , @xmath86 is formally given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 are i.i.d standard brownian motions and @xmath89 are scaling coefficients . when @xmath90 @xmath91 , @xmath92 is an infinite - variance wiener process and @xmath20 is gaussian white noise .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on noise representations with @xmath93-summable coefficients , such as @xmath94 so that @xmath85 has a _",
    "finite _ variance , meaning that it is square - integrable in @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 , with the norm @xmath97 for such a finite - variance wiener process , the term @xmath20 in equation will be referred to as the _ gaussian colored noise_.    while gaussian white noise is commonly used in the literature on spdes , this choice is not , in fact , suitable for the present study .",
    "as explained in introduction , we are interested here in the effects of stochastic excitation on the enstrophy , cf .  , which is not defined for the gaussian white noise , as demonstrated in appendix [ sec : white ] . on the other hand , gaussian colored noise with the structure given in ",
    "will ensure that this quantity is well defined .",
    "different notions of solution of system can be considered . due to the lack of smoothness of the noise term",
    ", we do not expect to obtain solutions defined in the classical sense ( i.e. , solutions continuously differentiable with respect to the independent variables ) .",

    "<S> this study considers the problem of the extreme behavior exhibited by solutions to burgers equation subject to stochastic forcing . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we are interested in the maximum growth achieved by the `` enstrophy '' ( the sobolev @xmath0 seminorm of the solution ) as a function of the initial enstrophy @xmath1 , in particular , whether in the stochastic setting this growth is different than in the deterministic case considered by ayala & protas ( 2011 ) . this problem is motivated by questions about the effect of noise on the possible singularity formation in hydrodynamic models . </S>",
    "<S> the main quantities of interest in the stochastic problem are the expected value of the enstrophy and the enstrophy of the expected value of the solution . the stochastic burgers equation is solved numerically with a monte carlo sampling approach . by studying solutions obtained for a range of optimal initial data and different noise magnitudes , we reveal different solution behaviors and it is demonstrated that the two quantities always bracket the enstrophy of the deterministic solution . </S>",
    "<S> the key finding is that the expected values of the enstrophy exhibit the same power - law dependence on the initial enstrophy @xmath1 as reported in the deterministic case . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the stochastic excitation does not increase the extreme enstrophy growth beyond what is already observed in the deterministic case .    </S>",
