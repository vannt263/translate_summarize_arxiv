    "one of the most basic problems is that how can one tell if a quantum state is entangled ? , and how entangled is it still after some noisy quantum process ( e.g. long distance quantum communication ) ?    a pure entangled state is a quantum state which can not be factorized , i.e. , @xmath2 , and shows remarkable nonlocal quantum correlations . from a practical point of view",
    ", the state of a composite quantum system which usually becomes a mixed state after a noisy process , is called _ unentangled _ or _ separable _ if it can be prepared in a local  or classical  way .",
    "it can then be expressed as an ensemble realization of pure product states @xmath3 occurring with a certain probability @xmath4 and the density matrix @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are normalized pure states of subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively werner89 .",
    "if no convex linear combination of @xmath13 exists for a given @xmath14 , then the state is called entangled .    however , for a generic mixed state @xmath14 , finding a separable decomposition or proving that it does not exist is a non - trivial task ( see the recent good reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there have been many efforts in recent years to analyze the separability and quantitative character of quantum entanglement .",
    "the bell inequalities satisfied by a separable system give the first necessary condition for separability @xcite .",
    "in 1996 , peres made an important step towards proving that , for a separable state , the partial transposition with respect to one subsystem of a bipartite density matrix is positive , @xmath15 .",
