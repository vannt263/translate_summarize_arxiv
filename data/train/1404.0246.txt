    "even kakutani equivalence is one of the most natural examples in the theory of restricted orbit equivalence of ergodic and finite measure preserving dynamical systems . in this paper",
    "we study even kakutani equivalence in the nearly continuous category .",
    "a nearly continuous dynamical system is given by a triple @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is a polish space , @xmath14 is a borel probability measure on @xmath2 , and @xmath15 is an ergodic measure preserving homeomorphism . recall that a measurable orbit equivalence between two such systems @xmath13 and @xmath16 is an invertible , bi - measurable , and measure preserving map @xmath17 that sends orbits to orbits . a measurable orbit equivalence @xmath18 is a _ nearly continuous orbit equivalence _ if there exist invariant and @xmath11 subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of full measure so that @xmath21 is a homeomorphism .",
    "the first result in this category is the celebrated theorem of keane and smorodinsky @xcite that any two bernoulli shifts of equal entropy are finitarily isomorphic , namely , that the isomorphism between them can be made a homeomorphism almost everywhere . in a later paper , denker and keane",
    "@xcite established a general framework for studying measure preserving systems that also preserve a topological structure .",
    "we refer the reader to a paper by del junco , rudolph , and weiss @xcite for a more complete history of the area .",
    "we only mention here that interest in the orbit equivalence theory for this category was more recently revived by the work of hamachi and keane in @xcite where they proved that the binary and ternary odometers are nearly continuously orbit equivalent .",
    "their work inspired similar results for other pairs of examples ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "these examples were later subsumed as special cases of a dye s theorem in this category proved by del junco and ahin @xcite .    around the same time as a nearly continuous dye",
    "s theorem was established , del junco , rudolph , and weiss proved in @xcite that if one does not impose the condition that the invariant sets of full measure on which the orbit equivalence is a homeomorphism are @xmath11 sets , then any restricted orbit equivalence classification is exactly the same as in the measure theoretic case . in particular",
    ", they showed that any orbit equivalence can be regularized to be a homeomorphism on a set of full measure , but could not prove that the set of full measure had any topological structure .",
    "the importance of the topological structure in the theory is even more striking for the study of even kakutani equivalence .",
    "recall that in the measurable category two ergodic and finite measure preserving systems @xmath13 and @xmath16 are even kakutani equivalent if there exists a measurable orbit equivalence @xmath22 , and measurable sets @xmath23 with @xmath24 with the property that @xmath25 is a measurable isomorphism of the induced transformations @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "we call the orbit equivalence @xmath6 an _ even kakutani equivalence _ between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from @xcite that any even kakutani equivalence can be made to be a homeomorphism on a set of full measure . in the same paper",
    "they show that if one imposes the additional condition that the sets @xmath12 and @xmath27 be _ nearly clopen _ , meaning within a set of measure zero of an open set and also of a closed set , then there is a new invariant for even kakutani equivalence of nearly continuous dynamical systems called _ near unique ergodicity_. they use this new invariant to show that nearly continuous even kakutani equivalence is stronger than measure theoretic even kakutani equivalence .",
    "the example they construct is , in some sense , not natural , and begs the question whether there are any natural examples of nearly continuous systems that are measurably evenly kakutani equivalent but not nearly continuously so .",
    "rudolph began looking for examples in the family of zero entropy loosely bernoulli systems .",
    "recall that any two zero entropy loosely bernoulli transformations are measurably even kakutani equivalent .",
    "furthermore , many natural examples of nearly continuous systems including rotations , all adding machines , and in fact all finite rank transformations , are loosely bernoulli . in @xcite ,",
    "roychowdhury and rudolph proved that any two adding machines are nearly continuously even kakutani equivalent .",
    "shortly after , dykstra and rudolph showed in @xcite that all irrational rotations are nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .    in @xcite , new machinery , called _ templates _",
    ", was introduced to construct the nearly continuous kakutani equivalence .",
    "there , templates were defined using the natural topological tower structure present in adding machines .",
    "the construction in @xcite showed that the template machinery can be adapted to the case where the underlying system does not have a canonical symbolic structure .",
    "more recently , springer @xcite expanded on their ideas and adapted templates further to prove that all minimal isometries of compact metric spaces are nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .",
    "salvi @xcite adapted templates to the setting of @xmath28 actions and used the machinery to prove rudolph s two - step coding theorem in the nearly continuous category .",
    "each result mentioned above has required more sophisticated and technically intricate incarnations of templates . on the other hand",
    "each proof has also established the usefulness and flexibility of the machinery . in this paper",
    "we adapt the template machinery even further to show our main result :    the morse minimal system is nearly continuously even kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .    the version of the template machinery in this paper is designed to address the new complication of the additional tower present in the rank two morse system .",
    "we believe the generalization we give here is the appropriate starting place to prove more generally that finite rank nearly continuous systems are all nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .",
    "finally we note that this manuscript is a culmination of work that the first author began in 2009 while he was a post - doctoral fellow working with daniel rudolph at colorado state university .",
    "the initial architecture of the constructions and the main ideas were all established collaboratively by dykstra and rudolph .",
    "the second author joined the project after the untimely death of rudolph in 2010 , and the manuscript was completed in 2014 .",
    "in this section , deferring some formal definitions until later , we give an overview of the construction and introduce templates .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the morse minimal system and @xmath30 the binary odometer . recall that each system has a canonical refining , generating sequence of clopen partitions that are given by the finite rank structure of each system .",
    "the morse system is rank two , so at each stage the partition is defined by a pair of towers .",
    "the odometer is rank one , so the sequence of partitions is defined by a sequence of single towers .",
    "the construction of the orbit equivalence uses an inductive back and forthprocedure .",
    "intuitively , at each stage we need to construct a set map from the levels of the tower of one system to the levels of the tower of the other system , switching the domain and range of the set maps at each stage .",
    "the orbit equivalence will be defined on the set of points for which our procedure will converge . in order for this set to be",
    "a @xmath11 set , and the map to be a homeomorphism , for each point where we have convergence we need to have the procedure stabilize after a finite number of steps .",
    "in other words , once we have defined the set map at a particular stage @xmath31 , we can not modify its domain at any successive stage .",
    "this introduces an obvious complication in the construction . at a particular stage @xmath31",
    ", we have to know that our choice of the set map on stage @xmath31 towers will be consistent with the choices that we will make for all stages after . to address this complication , informally speaking ,",
    "we do not actually choose a particular set map at any stage .",
    "instead , at each stage we construct a collection of set maps that are possible extensions of previous stage set maps , and that all agree on a set we call _ the good set_. the convergence then depends on us being able to provide enough choices at each stage @xmath31 so that it is possible to construct sufficiently many choices of maps at stage @xmath32 that extend the @xmath31-stage maps .",
    "templates are a combinatorial tool that have been designed to facilitate the intensive book keeping required to describe such a procedure .",
    "formally , _ template _ is an ordered multiset .",
    "for example , the multiset @xmath33 , together with the ordering @xmath34 , gives a template @xmath35 , which we write as @xmath36 the elements of a template ( with multiplicity ) are called _",
    "levels_. in our work , each level of a template will correspond to a clopen set that is a level of a tower .",
    "in particular , the towers themselves can be thought of as templates where each level appears exactly once and the ordering on the levels is exactly the ordering on the sets that is imposed by the underlying dynamics .",
    "notice that a set map from one tower to another can be thought of as a re - ordering of the levels of the domain tower according to the levels that they are being mapped to in the image tower .",
    "we replace the notion of a set map with maps between templates , where the re - ordering is not described by the map , but rather the ordering given by the image template .",
    "more formally , given templates @xmath35 and @xmath37 , written @xmath38 we _ represent _ @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the intervals @xmath39 \\subset { \\mathbb z}\\hspace{1 cm } \\mbox{and } \\hspace{1 cm } j = [ 0 , 1 , \\ldots , m-1 ] \\subset { \\mathbb z}\\ ] ] via the correspondences @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a _ partial interval bijection _",
    "is an ordered quintuple @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is some bijection .",
    "this perspective allows for an explicit combinatorial understanding of how many maps need to be defined at each stage in order to construct maps at later stages , on larger domains .",
    "it also allows for an explicit combinatorial description of how maps from one stage are constructed from maps of a previous stage , so it is easy to prove that the construction has indeed stabilized for points on a @xmath11 set of full measure .      in our proof we will construct an increasing sequence @xmath46 , templates for each system and partial interval bijections between template sets that constitute the  back and forth \" diagram given in figure [ thefigure ] below .",
    "the objects in the diagram are template sets .",
    "the template sets on the left ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) belong to the morse minimal system , while those on the right ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) belong to the binary odometer .",
    "the maps @xmath55 are partial interval bijections .",
    "a key ingredient of the diagram is its _ almost commutative _ nature , as introduced by roychowdhury and rudolph in @xcite . interpreting the levels of templates as levels of towers that form a refining sequence of partitions",
    ", we see that every level at stage @xmath31 of a tower is a subset of a level from a previous stage template , and the maps @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the natural inclusion maps .",
    "the consistency of set maps from one level to another is achieved by requiring that on the good set , all partial interval bijections agree when composed with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there are two key differences our work here and that of @xcite or @xcite in how we use templates from a particular stage to construct later stage templates . in particular , we can not use the notion of concatenation as was defined in the earlier papers , instead we define _ overlapping concatenations_. in addition , to accommodate the combinatoric structure of the towers of the morse minimal system we introduce a new family of partial interval bijections called _ reordering maps_. once the diagram is built up , however , the argument that it produces a well - defined nearly continuous kakutani equivalence is nearly identical to the arguments in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we include it here for completeness ( see sections [ convergenceofpibs ] and [ kakequivalence ] ) .    it is our hope that one day we might discover a more general machine that could characterize broad classes of systems , perhaps even all zero entropy loosely bernoulli systems .",
    "but at the moment it is not clear how such a machine , if one exists , could be sufficiently general to account for the differences between systems .",
