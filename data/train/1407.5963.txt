    "few bodies problems have been studied for long time in celestial mechanics , either as simplified models of more complex planetary systems or as benchmark models where new mathematical theories can be tested .",
    "the three  body problem has been a source of inspiration and study in celestial mechanics since newton and euler , in particular the restricted three body problem ( r3bp ) has demonstrated to be a good model of several systems in our solar system such as the sun ",
    "jupiter  asteroid system , and with less accuracy the sun ",
    "earth  moon system , in these systems the r3bp was used to know preliminary orbits in some space missions . in analogy with the r3bp , in this paper",
    "we study a restricted problem of four bodies consisting of three primaries moving in circular orbits keeping an equilateral triangle configuration and a massless particle moving under the gravitational attraction of the primaries .",
    "it is known that in our solar system we can find such configurations , the so called trojan asteroids of jupiter , mars and neptune form approximately an equilateral configuration with their respective planet and the sun , saturn  tethys ",
    "telesto , saturn  tethys",
    " calypso or saturn  dione ",
    "helen are good examples of such configuration .",
    "several authors @xcite , @xcite , have considered the restricted four body body problem to model the dynamics of a spacecraft in the sun - jupiter - asteroid - spacecraft system .",
    "+   + g. w. hill developed his famous lunar theory @xcite as an alternative approach for the study of the motion of the moon .",
    "as a first approximation , this approach consider a kepler problem ( earth - moon ) with a gravitational perturbation produced by a far away massive body ( sun ) , some orbital elements such as the eccentricities of the orbits of the moon and the earth and the inclination of the moon are supposed to be zero .",
    "previously to the hill s work , the approach to study the dynamics of the moon consisted on considering two kepler problems , one for the motion of the earth and the moon around their center of mass and other for the motion of the sun and such center of mass .",
    "however , this approach had several difficulties because of the solutions were given in terms of formal power series of orbitals elements , the principal inconvenience was due to the poor convergency of these series in terms of the ratios of the mean motions of the earth and the moon , the so called critical parameter .",
    "the success of the hill s approach was given by using his model to obtain a periodic orbit of the trajectory of the moon and then he included the orbital elements to correct it , in such a way , he avoided the computation of expansions in terms of the critical critical parameter . in a four body problem context , the smallness of one primary creates complicated equations of motion where an analytical study is extremely difficult to make and even there are technical inconveniences in the accuracy of numerical simulations . in the next sections we develop a model as a first approximation of the dynamics of a masses particle in a sun - planet - asteroid system , as possible applications of this model we can consider the massless body like a spacecraft or a small satellite like the moon of the trojan asteroid 624 hektor @xcite . in future works we may include relevant effects produced by inclinations and librations of the asteroids or perturbations due to other bodies for example .",
    "consider three point masses , called @xmath2 , moving in circular periodic orbits around their center of mass under their mutual newtonian gravitational attraction , forming an equilateral triangle configuration .",
    "a fourth massless particle is moving under the gravitational attraction of the primaries , this problem is known as the equilateral restricted four body problem or simply as the restricted four body problem ( r4bp ) .",
    "the equations of motion in the usual dimensionless coordinates of the massless particle referred to a synodic frame of reference , where the primaries remain fixed , are :    , width=240 ]    @xmath3    @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for @xmath8 .",
    "the general expressions of the coordinates of the primaries in terms of the masses of the three primaries are given by @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11}{2k\\sqrt{m_{2}^{2}+m_{2}m_{3}+m_{3}^{2}}},\\ ] ] @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14    where @xmath15 and the three masses satisfy the relation @xmath16 .",
    "it can be proved that the equations of motion have a first integral @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "it is worth noting that when we make @xmath19 and @xmath20 we recover the coordinates of the restricted three body problem ( r3bp ) @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , now the `` phantom '' mass @xmath0 is located in the so called equilibrium point @xmath24 of the r3bp . in the following",
    ", it will be necessary to consider the hamiltonian of the system @xmath25",
    "in this section we will discuss the how to compute the limit when @xmath1 for the r4bp .",
    "we use a similar procedure as shown in @xcite by considering a symplectic scaling of the hamiltonian and expansions in taylor series in a neighborhood of the small mass @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian will be a three degrees of freedom system depending on a parameter @xmath26 which is the mass of the primary @xmath27 .",
    "the limit @xmath1 of the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) restricted to a neighborhood of @xmath0 exists and gives rise to a new hamiltonian @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath20 .    _",
    "proof_. we consider the hamiltonian of the restricted four body problem ( r4bp ) in the center of mass coordinates @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the position of the primary @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "we make the change of coordinates @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , therefore in these new coordinates the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) becomes    @xmath42    where now we have @xmath43 for @xmath35 .",
    "we expand the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 in taylor series around the new origin of coordinates , if we ignore the constant terms we obtain the following expressions @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a homogenous polynomial of degree @xmath49 for @xmath50 in order to take the limit as @xmath1 , we perform the following symplectic scaling @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath56 with multiplier @xmath57 , therefore    @xmath58    @xmath59 a straightforward computation shows @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 it is important to note that the the first partial derivative is given by @xmath63 for @xmath64 therefore we obtain@xmath65 and @xmath66 now if we recall that the three masses are in equilateral configuration and we use the relation @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68x\\ ] ] @xmath69y,\\ ] ] in terms of the coordinates of the primaries ( [ coordinatesprimaries ] ) , we can write @xmath70=-m_{3}^{2/3}m_{2}s_{1}(m_{1},m_{2},m_{3})+m_{3}^{2/3}y_{3},\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath14 a similar computation shows that the coefficient @xmath72 $ ] can be written in terms of a positive power of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( [ scaled ] ) looks like @xmath73 we have defined @xmath74 .",
    "now , we are allowed to take the limit @xmath1 in the expression ( [ unlimitedhamiltonian ] ) , the final expression looks like @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath20 and @xmath30 .",
    "* remarks *    * the expression @xmath77 is the quadratic part of the hamiltonian of the restricted three body problem centered in the so called equilibrium point @xmath24 . * because of the above remark , we can consider the mass parameter in the range @xmath78 $ ] , the case where @xmath79 corresponds to the equal massive bodies case . *",
    "it will proved in the next section that this system have 4 equilibrium points in a neighborhood of @xmath0 and such equilibrium points will posses the same stability properties as in the full r4bp when @xmath0 is small but non zero .",
    "now the gravitational and effective potential are @xmath80 @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as in the full problem @xmath82 @xmath4 @xmath5 but @xmath83 is given by the equation ( [ hillefectivepotential ] ) .",
    "in this section we prove that the system has 4 equilibrium points and we will be able to compute them explicitly in terms of the mass parameter @xmath26 .",
    "so , in order to find the equilibrium points of the limit case , as usual , we need to find the critical points of the effective potential ( [ hillefectivepotential ] ) , an easy computation shows that @xmath84 the equation @xmath85 implies that @xmath86 so the equilibrium points of the system are coplanar .",
    "therefore , it is enough to study the critical points of the planar effective potential @xmath87 in matrix notation .",
