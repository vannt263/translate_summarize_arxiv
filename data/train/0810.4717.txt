    "the highest resolution observations in astronomy are possible via very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , which can be conducted routinely up to frequencies of 86ghz , yielding sharp images of the brightest objects in the universe resolved up to some tens of microarcseconds ( @xmath1as ; see , e.g. , the latest pioneering results by doeleman _ et al _ 2008 at even higher frequencies ) .",
    "typical resolutions are of the order of 0.53mas at the frequencies where atmospheric and ionospheric effects do not severely affect the performance of the observations .",
    "high resolution observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide access to the regions close to the central engine , believed to be a super - massive black hole ( e.g. , zensus 1995 ) .",
    "those are complemented by single - dish flux density monitoring to follow the changes in the innermost part also from the spectra , which reveal variations of the optically - thin ( synchrotron ) and optically thick regions ( closer to the self - absorbed jet base ) . additionally , radio spectra turnover frequency imaging yields information on the jet physics , particle density , composition , etc .",
    "( e.g. , lobanov 1998 ) .",
    "polarisation observations at the higher frequencies can also reveal the direction and nature of the magnetic fields in the inner jet .",
    "following the standard model ( e.g. , marscher 2006 ) the emission of a radio loud agn at different radio wavelengths originates at different distances from the base of the jet . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the bulk emission comes from closer to the central engine , since the synchrotron - self - absorption of the inner part of the jet is reduced at shorter wavelengths . assuming a central black hole surrounded by an accretion disk , and perpendicularly to this , a jet with superluminal plasma accelerated , the radio emission is produced by synchrotron at a region where no self - absorption is present .",
    "high - resolution radio observations are complemented by other regions of the spectra .",
    "agn broadband spectra show absorption , reflection and emission lines as well as a power - law continuum radiation which can be studied by analyzing the spectral energy distribution .",
    "their spectra show radio variability . in the x - rays , the observations of the iron k@xmath2 line at 6.4kev ( the most prominent fluorescent line ) probes the agn circumnuclear environment , from its variability and profile .",
    "the combination of radio and x - ray has been successful , i.e. , in the case of 3c120 ( marscher _ et al _ 2002 ) , where x - ray flux density `` dips '' precede vlbi jet ejections .",
    "the time delays are of the order of weeks to months caused by the offset of the core from the central engine and by the core shift between the observation frequency and the self - absorption turnover frequency .",
    "these `` dips '' can be put in the context of the discoveries in x - ray binaries ( see fender & belloni 2004 ) .",
    "flux - density selected samples of radio - loud agn are usually dominated by type 1 sources , with a one - sided jet morphology in high resolution radio images and the counter - jet usually not seen due to doppler relativistic boosting ( see e.g. , ros , these proceedings ) .",
    "type 1 sources have an accretion disk which is seen face - on , and no absorption is seen in the soft region of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "type 2 sources have an edge - on accretion disk , detected by strong absorption in the soft x - rays ( fabian _ et al _ 2000 ) , and free - free absorption is observed at the multi - wavelength radio structure imaging close to the central engine .",
    "ngc1052 ( b0238@xmath3084 , j0241@xmath30815 ) , classified as low - ionization nuclear emission - line region object ( liner ) , is a key source between both types , since it is radio loud , oriented in the plane of the sky , and emits in x - rays . due to its closeness ( with a redshift of @xmath4=0.0049 ( knapp _ et al _ 1978 ) , ngc1052 , despite of its relatively low radio luminosity , is still very bright in radio wavelengths and can be detected at all observing vlbi bands in jet and counter - jet ( see , e.g. , lee _ et al _ 2008 for 86ghz for the highest available vlbi frequency results published , with just one bright component ) . at arcsecond scales ( kadler _",
    "et al _ 2004a ; cooper _ et al _ 2008 ) it presents an east - west faint emission ( of 30@xmath5 in extension ) with a dominating core , which is also seen on mas - scales with a double - sided radio with a position angle of @xmath665@xmath7 .",
    "the jet axis is considered to be nearly parallel to the plane of the sky , with values between a lower limit of 57@xmath7 and 72@xmath7 ( vermeulen _ et al _ 2003 ; kadler _ et al _ 2004b ) .",
    "sawada - satoh _ et al _ ( 2008 ) determine values around 76@xmath780@xmath7 .",
    "high opacities are measured toward the innermost component of the western jet ( kadler _ et al _ 2004b ; kameno _ et al _ 2001 ; vermeulen _ et al _ 2003 ) , and also at the inner edge of the eastern jet at centimetre wavelengths ( kadler _ et al _ 2004b ; sawada - satoh _ et al _ 2008 ) .",
    "millimetre observations can see through this screen and reveal some structure at the innermost region .",
    "emission from h@xmath8o spots has been detected both at jet and counter - jet ( sawada - satoh _ et al _ 2008 and references therein ) , redshifted by 50350kms@xmath9 with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this water emission is interpreted to be located at the region where opacity dominates due to the thermal plasma in the obscuring torus via free - free absorption .",
    "x - ray spectra further support the presence of a dense gas torus ( guainazzi & antonelli 1999 ; weaver _ et al _ 1999 ; kadler _ et al _ 2004a ) toward the nuclear x - ray source .",
    "we started in 2005 a multi - mission campaign to track the ejection of new features at the base of the jet and counter - jets and compare with brightness monitoring and spectral studies in x - rays and radio , with the goal of establishing a relationship between changes in the high energy and the jet production in agn .",
