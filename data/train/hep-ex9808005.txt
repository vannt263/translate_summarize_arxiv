    "data from the intermediate energy region of e@xmath5e@xmath6 annihilation , as provided by the jade experiment at petra , allow significant tests of perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this was stressed in a recently published analysis of jade data  @xcite where determinations of the strong coupling constant @xmath0 at @xmath1 = 22 to 44  gev were presented , which are the most precise ones at petra energies . since the analysis is based on event shape observables for which resummed qcd predictions  @xcite ( nlla )",
    "were developed long after the petra shutdown , the theoretical uncertainties of previous measurements  @xcite could be reduced significantly . by applying lep - established techniques of estimating experimental and theoretical systematics ,",
    "the running of @xmath0 was tested _",
    "consistently _ within a large range of energy scales  @xcite .    a reliable estimation of the higher order uncertainties of the predictions , individually for each observable , is supported by considering as many observables as possible .",
    "hence , an update of determinations of @xmath0 at petra energies  @xcite is performed , now additionally considering new calculations for the @xmath2 parameter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , improved calculations for the jet broadening variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite are applied .",
    "jade data also provide clearer evidence for non - perturbative effects @xcite , which typically contribute with reciprocal powers of @xmath1 .",
    "they are accounted for by so - called _ power corrections _ which , on general grounds , are found from several theoretical approaches such as renormalons @xcite or the dispersive approach @xcite . in the following , new predictions for power corrections to the differential distributions are tested using jade data and also lep data up to @xmath1 = 183  gev .",
    "the jade detector , one of the experiments at the petra e@xmath5e@xmath6 collider , was designed as a hybrid 4@xmath8-detector to measure charged and neutral particles .",
    "it was operated from 1979 until 1986 at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath1 = 12.0 to 46.7 gev .",
    "this analysis focuses on 20926 events at 35  gev and 6158 events at 44  gev passing the standard jade multihadron selection  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 analysis is based on the event shape distributions of the thrust @xmath9 , heavy jet mass @xmath10 , the differential 2-jet rate using the durham jet finder , @xmath11 , the total and wide jet broadening @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the @xmath2 parameter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for the latter , no experimental results",
    "have previously been presented at petra energies .",
    "the data are corrected for detector effects and initial state photon radiation using a parton shower plus string fragmention model ( jetset , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and a full detector simulation . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "there is good agreement of the monte carlo model with the data , despite the larger hadronization effects at lower energies .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath0 is determined by @xmath12 fits of combined nlla  @xcite and @xmath13(@xmath14 )  @xcite calculations to the event shape distributions after unfolding for hadronization  @xcite .",
    "the previously published measurements of @xmath0 at 35 and 44  gev  @xcite are complemented by using new resummed calculations for the @xmath2 parameter  @xcite and by applying improved resummed calculations for @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite . in the latter case , all single logarithmic terms of the prediction",
    "are now handled more accurately by a proper treatment of the quark recoil against multi - gluon emission .    in the case of the @xmath2 parameter",
    ", the combined resummed plus fixed order theory gives an excellent description of the data over the entire range of the distribution , even at the low petra energies  @xcite .",
    "the recoil - corrected calculations on the jet broadenings do not yield a significant improvement of the previous fits  @xcite .",
    "the excess of the theoretical curve over the data in the 3-jet region is still present , but the @xmath0 results are now shifted by about 3% to higher values .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and the errors obtained at @xmath1  = 35  gev are shown in fig .  [ fig - as ] , indicating that the results are consistent with each other . the combination of the individual results of the six observables using the weighted average method  @xcite yields as final results @xmath15 various uncertainties emerging from experimental measurement , event selection , hadronization corrections and the choice of the qcd - renormalization scale were regarded as systematic errors of the fits  @xcite .",
    "a technique for studying power suppressed contributions to event shapes is the dispersive approach  @xcite .",
    "a recent publication  @xcite points out that the effect of power corrections on the event shapes mentioned above is simply a _ shift _",
    "@xmath16 of the perturbative spectrum by an amount proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 = @xmath1 .",
    "the shift depends on two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 and an observable - dependent coefficient @xmath22 : @xmath23 @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of effective coupling moments @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite,@xmath26 \\\\ { \\cal p}^{\\prime}=   a \\frac{\\mu_i}{q } \\hspace*{-1 mm } \\left [ \\alpha_0^{\\prime}(\\mu_i)+\\alpha_s(q )      + \\beta_0\\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{2\\pi } \\left(\\hspace*{-.5 mm } \\ln \\frac{q}{\\mu_i}+\\frac{k}{\\beta_0}+2       \\hspace*{-.5 mm } \\right ) \\hspace*{-1 mm } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath27 contains the so - called milan factor @xmath28 arising from a two - loop calculation of the observable - dependent factor .",
    "the milan factor is expected to be universal  @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 is an infrared matching scale  @xcite , usually set to 2  gev .",
    "an important feature of the dispersive approach is that the only free parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are expected to be approximately _ universal _  @xcite .",
    "the universality of the power corrections is tested using differential data distributions at hadron level measured with jade at @xmath1 = 35 and 44  gev @xcite , and also using data from various lep experiments up to @xmath1 = 183  gev  @xcite . both perturbative qcd ( @xmath30+nlla ) and power corrections",
    "are compared by a global simultaneous fit of @xmath0 , @xmath24 and , in the case of the jet broadenings , additionally @xmath25 to the data .",
    "[ fig - global_fits ] shows the results of the fits ( solid lines ) to the data ( points ) . unlike in a similar analysis in  @xcite",
    ", each energy has its individual fit range including the maximum peaks in the 2-jet region .",
    "the fitted distributions are in good agreement with the data within the fit ranges .    in the case of the jet broadenings , a strong correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "is observed , presumably because the pure 1/@xmath19 term @xmath31 containing @xmath25 was found to be small and fairly energy independent above @xmath1 = 35  gev .",
    "a reanalysis of more data at lower energies is needed to resolve both @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for now , this contribution and , hence , the dependence on @xmath25 was neglected .",
    "the corresponding fit results for @xmath0(@xmath32 ) and @xmath24(2 gev ) are presented in table  [ tab - fit - results ] , and in fig .",
    "[ fig - con ] with 95% confidence level contours . in the case of @xmath2 parameter and",
    " for comparison  thrust @xmath9 , the results for @xmath0 are compatible with the world average value of 0.118  @xcite . furthermore , there is a fair agreement of the corresponding @xmath24 values .",
    "however , @xmath0 from the fits to the jet broadenings yields @xmath0 = 0.0954 @xmath33 0.0017 , @xmath24 = 0.710 @xmath33 0.081 , @xmath25 = -0.707 @xmath33 0.166 and a correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 of + 98 % . ]",
    "is far off the world average . here , the universality of the effective coupling moment is not observed .",
    "the presence of possible 1/@xmath34 contributions can be tested by considering lep data and jade data separately in the analysis .",
    "[ fig - con_low+high ] demonstrates that , in the case of the @xmath2 parameter , the jade data reduce significantly the statistical uncertainties of the fit . in the case of @xmath3 ,",
    "a minor indication for 1/@xmath34 terms emerges .",
    ".[tab - fit - results]preliminary results for @xmath0 and @xmath24 .",
    "the errors stated are the statistical errors of the fit . [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a comparison of the fits based on distributions corrected for hadronization as described in section [ sec - as_update ] and the hadron level fits using the power correction ansatz points out that the transformation from the perturbative to the non - perturbative level is not sufficiently described by a simple shift . clearly , an additional _ squeeze _ of the distributions is needed , i.e. power corrections additionally depending on the value of the observable . in the present fits",
    ", @xmath0 appears as the only parameter inducing a squeeze .",
    "thus , a combination of rather large values for @xmath24 and extremely small values for @xmath0 is needed to fit the hadron level distributions .",
    "this mechanism explains the observed anticorrelation between @xmath0 and @xmath24 as seen in fig.[fig - con ] .",
    "however , a shift is sufficient to describe the impact of hadronization on the _ means _ of the event shape distributions  @xcite .",
    "combined resummed and fixed order qcd provides consistent determinations of @xmath0 at petra energies .",
    "recently presented calculations for the @xmath2 parameter , @xmath3 and @xmath4 fit previously published data at @xmath1 = 35 and 44  gev , yielding @xmath35 = 0.123 @xmath36 and 0.123 @xmath37 , respectively , in good agreement with the world average value  @xcite .",
    "power corrections to differential event shape distributions are tested using hadron level data between @xmath1 = 35 and 183  gev .",
    "reliable fits are obtained in the case of the @xmath2 parameter and the thrust , where non - perturbative effects are approximately described by the predicted shift of the perturbative spectra .",
    "this does not apply to the case of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , yielding @xmath0 results incompatible with other measurements at the @xmath38 pole . for the present calculations , the universality of the effective coupling moment @xmath24 at the level of 20% is only verified for @xmath2 parameter and thrust",
