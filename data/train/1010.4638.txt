    "there are several known examples of polymers in nature that are composed by two or more strands arranged in a helical conformation .",
    "one is the double helical structure of dna , in which two complementary sequences are held together by hydrogen bonding between a / t or c / g nucleotides .",
    "another example is the triple helical structure of collagen . under the appropriate thermodynamic conditions the multi - stranded structure becomes unstable and the strands dissociate from each other . for a dna molecule ,",
    "the dissociation of the two strands is usually referred to as the melting transition or denaturation ; this happens when the temperature is increased typically above @xmath3 c in standard conditions  @xcite . in view of its importance in many biological and biotechnological processes ,",
    "various models of dna melting have been developed to study the thermodynamical behavior as function of the sequence length and composition .",
    "models originally proposed by poland and scheraga @xcite ( ps ) and by peyrard and bishop @xcite ( pb ) take into account the different unbinding energies required to dissociate complementary g / c or a / t pairs using various types of approximations , yet they are simple enough to deal with very long dna sequences . using an appropriate choice of parameters they both fit reasonably well experimental data for the melting temperature of dna sequences @xcite .    the melting _",
    "dynamics _ has also been studied . in 1986 ,",
    "baumgrtner and muthukumar  @xcite performed monte carlo simulations of the disentangling of two initially intertwined chains .",
    "after an initial softening of the original double helix , they reported that the time required for the actual unraveling of the chains scales with polymer length as a power law with exponent @xmath4 .",
    "computer technology at that time allowed for simulations of 2 , 4 and 8 turns only , and their fitted exponent might very well change with increasing chain length .",
    "the dynamics of the opening of bubbles in an entangled chain has also been studied @xcite .",
    "in addition different extensions of the ps and pb models were considered to include helical degrees of freedom of dna molecules @xcite .",
    "these extensions allow for rapid computations of equilibrium and dynamical properties of the melting transition , at the cost of introducing approximations which are poorly controlled and sometimes even questionable .",
    "the moves introduced to update ps models usually neglect the helicity of dsdna , which is locally conserved due to impenetrability of the two strands ( the unbinding of the two strands forming the double helix requires a release of the twist through a rotation of these strands with respect to each other ) . with the denaturation times @xmath5 characterized by the scaling law @xmath6 for the dna strand length @xmath0 ( in base pairs ) , the resulting values of @xmath7 thus range from @xmath8 @xcite to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if local moves preserving the dna helicity are introduced , a very slow melting is instead observed , with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a second simplification intrinsic in ps models is that helical fragments and loops are described by equilibrium partition functions .",
    "this description can be too simplified in systems where the dynamics of the unwinding process is too fast to allow for the full structural relaxation within these loops .",
    "pb models have as a major simplification the possibility for complementary bases to orbit around a virtual central axis of the macromolecule .",
    "this yields denaturation times scaling linearly with the chain length  @xcite .",
    "given such spread of results , and uncontrolled simplifications in these models , we must conclude that we are still missing the understanding of how dna length affects the time for its strands to disentangle .    in order to gain more direct insight into the dynamics of the melting process of double - stranded molecules we investigate the unwinding dynamics of double - stranded three - dimensional long polymers using monte carlo simulations in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "no binding energies between the two strands are taken into account during the unwinding process , corresponding to the case of a double helix brought rapidly to a temperature well above its melting point .",
    "for such a setup , the strands unwind from each other as it is entropically favorable for them to do so .",
    "we follow a procedure very similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , except that our chains are much longer , and more tightly wound .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] shows three configurations : ( a ) at the early stages of unwinding , ( b ) during the unwinding process , and ( c ) at the end of the unwinding , when the two stands are separating from each other .",
    "the main scope of this manuscript is two - fold : in section  [ sec : time ] we study the unwinding time @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0  high precision simulations for polymers of length up to @xmath12 show that @xmath11 scales as a power - law @xmath13 with @xmath14 . in section  [ sec : size ] we show that the intermediate conformations can be characterized as a tightly wound inner part , to which unwound single strands are connected .",
    "the length of the unwound strands increases with time in a powerlaw fashion as @xmath15 . with a theoretical argument",
    ", we find an upper bound for the radius of gyration of the loose ends , which excludes the equilibrium value .",
    "this demonstrates that the unwinding is a far from equilibrium process .",
    "in the simulation the polymers reside on a face - centered - cubic lattice with a lattice spacing of @xmath16 , and are initialized in a double - helical state .",
    "the polymers evolve in time through a long sequence of single - monomer moves , under the restriction that at all times , the polymer backbones are self- and mutually avoiding .",
    "each allowed move occurs with a statistical rate of unity . to give the polymers some elasticity ,",
    "the self - avoidance condition is lifted for monomers which are direct neighbors along the same chain .",
    "a detailed description of this lattice polymer model , its computationally efficient implementation , and a study of some of its properties and applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "this model reproduces known features of the rouse dynamics @xcite and of the equilibrium properties @xcite of single self - avoiding polymers .",
    "as the moves respect the no - crossing condition between strands , we expect that the long time behavior of unwinding discussed in this study is of universal nature and is not affected by microscopic details and lattice effects .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the lattice positions of the @xmath19-th monomers on the two strands at time @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we consider the minimal distance between two strands defined as @xmath22 .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig02 ] shows a plot of @xmath23 as a function of time for a run .",
    "the choice of an initial double - helical conformation implies that @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath26 remains constant up to a time @xmath27 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] and then starts fluctuating and increasing in time .",
    "we define the unwinding time @xmath11 as the time at which @xmath26 exceeds some threshold value for the first time . for the threshold value @xmath28 we took @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the higher threshold value gives a slightly higher estimate of the unwinding time [ @xmath31 and @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ] .",
    "however , as the polymer length increases the ratio of @xmath33 converges to @xmath34 as shown in table  [ tab ] , hence the two quantities have the same scaling behavior in @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] and table [ tab ] show the behavior of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as a function of polymer length .",
    "we note that the scaling of unwinding times is a power of the strand length : from a linear regression of the data for @xmath35 we find the values @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , from which we obtain the result anticipated above @xmath40 .",
    "given the topological constraint each strand faces while unwinding , we expect the unwinding dynamics to unroll from the two ends of the initial double - stranded complex , progressing inwards with increasing time ( fig .  [ fig03 ] ) .",
    "note that because of the elasticity of the model used in the simulations , a partial opening up of the inner wound part is not ruled out by the model : it is the physics of the problem that seems to suppress this . in order to connect this physical picture with the observed scaling @xmath41 we considered the quantity @xmath42 which is the minimal distance from the @xmath19-th monomer of the first strand to any other monomer of the second strand .",
    "its average square @xmath43 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] for a strand length equal to @xmath44 .",
    "the different data are for increasing time step snapshots taken at time intervals equal to @xmath45 ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is minimal in the middle , while it increases in time from the two edges , in agreement with the physical picture proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "we consider now the normalized profile @xmath46 .",
    "for this quantity we expect the following scaling behavior , as a function of the distance from the end monomer ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 a scaling function and @xmath50 a characteristic length depending on time .",
    "the inset of fig .  [ fig04 ] show that the normalized profiles at different times collapse when a rescaling @xmath51 is used , which implies @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the exponent determined from the scaling of unwinding time as @xmath52 .    in order to gain insight into the unwinding we set up a simple analytical model of the process , assuming that the unwinding is sufficiently slow so that the conformation of the loose strands can be approximated by equilibrium ones at all times .",
    "we will show that this approach predicts an unwinding dynamics which is slower than what is observed in simulations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the unwinding we observe is a far from equilibrium process .",
    "consider an intermediate conformation which consists of two single - stranded coils of @xmath53 attached to a double stranded helical part of length @xmath54 .",
    "we estimate the free energy @xmath55 as a function of @xmath54 from the partition function for a double helical segment of length @xmath56 is @xmath57 and that of a single stranded coil @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the connectivity constants . in other words",
    "@xmath60 as an infinitesimal portion @xmath61 of the double helix unwinds , the change in free energy is thus given by @xmath62 during this infinitesimal unwinding , the single - stranded coils are displaced over a distance @xmath63 due to the rotational motion around the axis of the helix : the coils describe a fraction of a circle of radius @xmath64 perpendicular to the axis of the helix , where @xmath64 is the distance from the helix axis to the coil s center of mass . in equilibrium we expect @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the flory exponent .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 during this process the work done against friction equals @xmath68 where for rouse dynamics the friction on the single - stranded coils is proportional to their lengths : @xmath69 .",
    "since the work done against friction can not exceed the available free energy , we obtain the inequality @xmath70 if this inequality were saturated , the unwinding process would be described by @xmath71^{2\\nu + 1 } \\frac{ds}{dt}.    \\label{diff_eq}\\ ] ] the integration of eq .",
    "( [ diff_eq ] ) yields a scaling of the unwinding time as @xmath72 ( since @xmath73 ) , which is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ diff_eq ] ) by setting @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , a visual investigation of the unwound parts during simulations reveals that these show a tendency to be spiral - like , and contain a significant amount of coiling .",
    "a precise quantification of the amount of spiraling is very difficult due to the lack of a clean definition of the central axis of the spiral .",
    "this argument predicts a very slow unwinding compared to that which is actually observed in simulations , suggesting that unwinding proceeds through non - equilibrium states . in an early study of unwinding @xcite",
    "the scaling @xmath75 was computed for shorter polymers ( up to @xmath76 ; with 2 , 4 or 8 turns in the double helix ) and for helices less tightly bound than considered here .",
    "the exponent of  @xcite most likely describes a pre - asymptotic scaling regime .",
    "the exponent reported in @xcite is however compatible with that predicted from eq .",
    "( [ diff_eq ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the early stages of unwinding are probably well captured by the mechanisms underlying the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ diff_eq ] ) , but that the asymptotic scaling regime is dominated by a mechanism which is faster for longer chains .",
    "summarizing , we introduced a lattice model for studying the unwinding dynamics of a long three - dimensional double stranded polymer , with excluded volume effects taken into account .",
    "the lattice nature of the model , combined with an efficient encoding of the dynamics , allows one to simulate long polymers ( up to @xmath77 ) for very long time ( @xmath78 monte carlo steps ) .",
    "our numerical results show that the unwinding time scales with the polymer length as a power - law with exponent @xmath79 with rouse dynamics .",
    "an analysis of a simple analytical model of the process suggests that the unwinding we observe is a far from equilibrium process , therefore it can not be understood in terms of a slow dynamics evolving through quasi - equilibrium states , e.g. using free energy arguments .",
