    "<S> we examine the density - functional theory of macroscopic insulators , obtained in the large - cluster limit or under periodic boundary conditions . for _ polar _ crystals , we find that the two procedures are not equivalent . in a large - cluster case , the exact exchange - correlation potential acquires a homogeneous `` electric field '' which is absent from the usual local approximations , and the kohn - sham electronic system becomes metallic . with periodic boundary conditions , </S>",
    "<S> such a field is forbidden , and the polarization deduced from kohn - sham wavefunctions is incorrect even if the exact functional is used .    </S>",
    "<S> although the density - functional theory ( dft ) introduced by hohenberg , kohn and sham @xcite has become the standard method for first - principles calculations of the ground - state properties of solids , to our knowledge  @xcite , the implications of applying dft to infinite , insulating , crystals have not been fully appreciated . in part , this reflects the fact that the key theorems of dft @xcite were proved for arbitrarily large , but not infinite , systems . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the exact dft treatment of _ polar _ crystals ( a ) with the usual born - von karman ( bvk ) boundary conditions , or ( b ) from the macroscopic limit of large clusters , will generally give different macroscopic polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> only ( b ) is correct .    </S>",
    "<S> investigating the _ response _ of periodic insulators to a homogeneous electric field , we recently revealed  @xcite the polarization - dependence of the exchange - correlation energy , and its consequences on the dielectric response . </S>",
    "<S> aulbur , jnsson and wilkins  @xcite quantified this effect for real materials , while resta  @xcite discussed the origin of such a behaviour in connection with long - range correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the present study emphasizes a more basic role of the polarization in dft : careful handling of the polarization is mandatory for polar solids , even under zero electric field . in polar materials , the spontaneous polarization computed from the kohn - sham ( ks ) wavefunctions will be correct only if an exchange - correlation homogeneous electric field is allowed throughout the material , in which case the ks electronic system becomes _ </S>",
    "<S> metallic_. this field will appear in the exact dft treatment of a finite cluster but is forbidden when using bvk conditions . </S>",
    "<S> approximate density - functionals such as the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) always fail to yield an exchange - correlation electric field : within these approximations , using bvk boundary conditions or finite clusters incorrectly provide the _ same _ value of the polarization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any improvement to these functionals which retains a dependence only on the periodic density will be similarly flawed . </S>",
    "<S> we will exhibit our results for a one - dimensional model semiconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> the correct definition of a macroscopic crystal is clearly as the limit of a finite crystal of increasing size . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows schematically the total electrostatic potential @xmath0 in such a finite crystal , where @xmath1 is the electrostatic potential due to the ground - state electron density , @xmath2 is the potential due to the nuclei , and @xmath3 is an applied potential , created by an external short - circuited capacitor , that maintains equality of the electrostatic potential on the two sides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sum @xmath4 is referred to as the external potential . </S>",
    "<S> the total electrostatic potential in the bulk region is periodic and , crucially for a non - zero polarization , non - centrosymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the potential just outside the surface is fixed by the electrostatic potential of the capacitor plates . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ground - state electron density is also shown . in the bulk region </S>",
    "<S> , it is periodic , with the same periodicity as the local potential  @xcite . close to the surface </S>",
    "<S> , the density deviates from perfect periodicity , although this effect decreases exponentially with the distance from the surface  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic polarization of such a finite solid is directly linked to the total surface charge  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its value is equal to zero ( modulo a half - quantum ) if the crystal is centrosymmetric @xcite , but otherwise can have any value and must be calculated . for a long time </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic polarization was only accessible from the surface charge and was a well - defined concept only for finite solids . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical advances have shown that it can also conveniently be determined , up to a quantum , from a berry phase of the correlated many - body wavefunction of the _ bulk _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic polarization appears as a bulk property and is unambiguously defined even for the infinite periodic solid , which is of practical interest in solid state _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the breakthrough of king - smith and vanderbilt  @xcite , leading to the modern theory of the polarization , was actually carried out in the context of dft . </S>",
    "<S> later , they argued  @xcite that the berry phase of the occupied ks wavefunctions possesses an exact physical meaning since the surface charge must be exactly reproduced within dft @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now show that the justification of vanderbilt and king - smith apply to exact dft _ only _ when considering _ finite _ solids , and not when applying bvk periodic boundary conditions .    in the context of dft </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the density @xmath5 of the ground state of a system uniquely determines the external potential up to a constant . following kohn and sham  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one can introduce a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons in an effective potential @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the exchange correlation potential ) that reproduces the ground - state electron density of the real system . in the particular case </S>",
    "<S> where _ periodic boundary conditions _ are imposed , although the ks effective potential @xmath8 is constrained to reproduce the correct _ periodic _ bulk density of the polar solid , there is no guarantee that it will reproduce the correct _ polarization _ , since this information is not contained in the criterion for the effective potential to be correct  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a periodic dft is based only on the periodic part of the density , while the polarization is a completely independent quantity @xcite that depends on the phase of the correlated wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization will be correct only in those solids where a fundamental symmetry ( such as centrosymmetry ) constrains the polarization , or where external parameters , such as the pressure , are fortuitously chosen .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this for a one - dimensional model semiconductor  @xcite . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential is periodic and asymmetric : @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> a non - local self - energy operator , intended to mimic the relevant many - body effects , has the same non - local form as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] is a negative function with the periodicity of one unit cell and @xmath12 is a normalized gaussian of width @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the schrdinger equation containing the self - energy operator is solved by direct diagonalization using a plane - wave basis set . </S>",
    "<S> the density is deduced from the sum of the squares of the eigenfunctions . from this result , using standard iterative optimization techniques , we construct an _ exact _ density - functional theory by determining the local potential @xmath14 which , when filled with _ non - interacting _ electrons ( no self - energy operator ) , reproduces the same electron density as in the self - energy calculation . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath18 ev , @xmath19 ev , @xmath20 a.u .    </S>",
    "<S> using the berry - phase approach  @xcite , we then compute the polarization  @xcite . in the self - energy calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the polarization is @xmath21 electrons with respect to the centrosymmetric system with @xmath22 , while that calculated from the berry phase of the kohn - sham wave - functions is @xmath23 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the two polarizations differ by @xmath24% , well outside the calculational error bar . </S>",
    "<S> this value may be taken as an order of magnitude estimation of the effect in real materials , and is compatible with the observed ( and often satisfactory ) accuracy of lda polarization calculations for real ferroelectric materials @xcite .    the deficiency in the periodic - boundary approach , reflected in the berry phase of the ks wavefunctions and hence in the polarization , is that the exchange - correlation potential is prevented from having a component which is linear in space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ks theorem demonstrates that there is only one periodic effective potential @xmath8 that reproduces a particular periodic density . </S>",
    "<S> however , once an additional linear component is allowed , there exists an infinite family of ks potentials that gives the same periodic density but different polarizations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> imposing bvk conditions on the potential thus arbitrarily constrains the polarization to a specific , usually incorrect , value . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction does not apply for the finite cluster , where application of the ks theorem shows that there exists a unique effective potential that , when used in the effective hamiltonian , will generate the exact ground - state density _ everywhere _ : not only in the bulk region ( as in the bvk case ) , but _ also _ in the surface region , resulting in the correct polarization . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) sketches the behaviour of such an effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> the linear part is necessary to yield the correct polarization in polar crystals . </S>",
    "<S> this  exchange - correlation electric field \" originates in the ultra non - local dependence of the exchange - correlation energy in the surface charge pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the small cluster shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , the magnitude of the exchange - correlation field is approximately independent of the cluster size , since the polarization correction relative to periodic dft is constant . </S>",
    "<S> as the cluster is made larger , a point will be reached where the variation in potential from one side of the cluster to the other , due to the homogeneous exchange - correlation electric field , reaches the dft band gap of the material . beyond this point , </S>",
    "<S> the ks electronic system is _ metallic _ and the band edges will  pin \" the effective potential ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . as the cluster is made still larger , charge will flow freely from one face to the other in order to maintain the correct macroscopic polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the homogeneous electric field will now change with the size of the cluster in order to maintain the potential drop : in the limit of large cluster size , the effective homogeneous electric field will be infinitesimally small , although non - zero . as mentioned in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an infinite system can not sustain a finite homogeneous electric field in its ground - state . here , an infinitesimal field appears naturally in the dft treatment of polar solids .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong similarity between this behaviour and that of a system of two distant , different , open - shell atoms @xcite , in which the exact exchange - correlation potential exhibits a long - range spatial variation to align the kohn - sham eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a connection with the dft metal / insulator paradox  @xcite in which an insulating system may be described as metallic in dft .    in summary , for a polar insulator , </S>",
    "<S> when born - von karman periodic boundary conditions are used , the polarizations calculated from the berry phase of the kohn - sham wavefunctions and from the berry phase of the correlated wavefunction will differ , because the dft effective potential is prevented from acquiring a linear part . when a large cluster is used for the dft calculation , a homogeneous effective exchange - correlation `` electric field '' develops in order to correctly reproduce the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the kohn - sham system becomes metallic .    </S>",
