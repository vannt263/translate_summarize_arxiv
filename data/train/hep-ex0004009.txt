    "the key question of calorimetry generally and hadronic calorimetry in particular is the energy reconstruction .",
    "this question is especially important when a hadronic calorimeter have a complex structure being a combined calorimeter .",
    "such is the combined calorimeter with the electromagnetic and hadronic compartments of the atlas detector @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the non - parametrical method of the energy reconstruction for a combined calorimeter , which called the @xmath0 method , and demonstrate its performance on the basis of the test beam data of the atlas combined prototype calorimeter . for the energy reconstruction and description of the longitudinal development of a hadronic shower",
    "it is necessary to know the @xmath0 ratios , the degree of non - compensation , of these calorimeters . as to the atlas tile barrel calorimeter",
    "there is the detailed information about the @xmath0 ratio presented in @xcite .",
    "but as to the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter such information is practically absent .",
    "the aim of the present work is also to develop the method and to determine the value of the @xmath0 ratio of the electromagnetic compartment .",
    "one of the important questions of hadron calorimetry is the question of the longitudinal development of hadronic showers .",
    "this question is especially important for a combined calorimeter .",
    "this work is also devoted to the study of the longitudinal hadronic shower development in the atlas barrel combined prototype calorimeter .",
    "this work has been performed on the basis of the 1996 combined test beam data @xcite .",
    "the data have been taken in the h8 beam line of the cern sps using pions of 10 , 20 , 40 , 50 , 80 , 100 , 150 and 300 gev .",
    "the combined calorimeter prototype setup has been made consisting of the lar electromagnetic calorimeter prototype inside the cryostat and downstream the tile calorimeter prototype as shown in fig .",
    "the two calorimeters have been placed with their central axes at an angle to the beam of @xmath10 . at this angle",
    "the two calorimeters have an active thickness of 10.3 @xmath11 .",
    "beam quality and geometry were monitored with a set of beam wire chambers bc1 , bc2 , bc3 and trigger hodoscopes placed upstream of the lar cryostat . to detect punchthrough particles and to measure the effect of longitudinal leakage a `` muon wall '' consisting of 10 scintillator counters ( each",
    "2 cm thick ) was located behind the calorimeters at a distance of about 1 metre .",
    "the electromagnetic lar calorimeter prototype consists of a stack of three azimuthal modules , each one spanning @xmath12 in azimuth and extending over 2 m along the z direction .",
    "the calorimeter structure is defined by 2.2 mm thick steel - plated lead absorbers folded to an accordion shape and separated by 3.8 mm gaps filled with liquid argon .",
    "the signals are collected by kapton electrodes located in the gaps .",
    "the calorimeter extends from an inner radius of 131.5 cm to an outer radius of 182.6 cm , representing ( at @xmath13 ) a total of 25 radiation lengths ( @xmath14 ) , or 1.22 interaction lengths ( @xmath11 ) for protons .",
    "the calorimeter is longitudinally segmented into three compartments of @xmath15 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "more details about this prototype can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cryostat has a cylindrical form with 2 m internal diameter , filled with liquid argon , and is made out of a 8 mm thick inner stainless - steel vessel , isolated by 30 cm of low - density foam ( rohacell ) , itself protected by a 1.2 mm thick aluminum outer wall .",
    "the hadronic tile calorimeter is a sampling device using steel as the absorber and scintillating tiles as the active material @xcite .",
    "the innovative feature of the design is the orientation of the tiles which are placed in planes perpendicular to the z direction @xcite . for a better sampling homogeneity",
    "the 3 mm thick scintillators are staggered in the radial direction .",
    "the tiles are separated along z by 14 mm of steel , giving a steel / scintillator volume ratio of 4.7 .",
    "wavelength shifting fibres ( wls ) running radially collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges .",
    "the hadron calorimeter prototype consists of an azimuthal stack of five modules .",
    "each module covers @xmath17  in azimuth and extends 1 m along the z direction , such that the front face covers @xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "the radial depth , from an inner radius of 200 cm to an outer radius of 380 cm , accounts for 8.9 @xmath20  at @xmath13   ( 80.5 @xmath14 ) .",
    "read - out cells are defined by grouping together a bundle of fibres into one photomultiplier ( pmt ) .",
    "each of the 100 cells is read out by two pmts and is fully projective in azimuth ( with @xmath21 ) , while the segmentation along the z axis is made by grouping fibres into read - out cells spanning @xmath22  cm ( @xmath23 ) and is therefore not projective .",
    "each module is read out in four longitudinal segments ( corresponding to about 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 and 3 @xmath11  at @xmath13 ) .",
    "more details of this prototype can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data have been taken in the h8 beam line of the cern sps using pions of 10 , 20 , 40 , 50 , 80 , 100 , 150 and 300 gev .",
    "we applied some similar to @xcite cuts to eliminate the non - single track pion events , the beam halo , the events with an interaction before the lar calorimeter , the electron and muon events .",
    "the set of cuts is the following : the single - track pion events were selected by requiring the pulse height of the beam scintillation counters and the energy released in the presampler of the electromagnetic calorimeter to be compatible with that for a single particle ; the beam halo events were removed with appropriate cuts on the horizontal and vertical positions of the incoming track impact point and the space angle with respect to the beam axis as measured with the beam chambers ; a cut on the total energy rejects incoming muon .",
    "the response , @xmath24 , of a calorimeter to a hadronic shower is the sum of the contributions from the electromagnetic , @xmath25 , and hadronic , @xmath26 , parts of the incident energy @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the energy independent coefficient of transformation of the electromagnetic ( pure hadronic , low - energy hadronic activity ) energy to response , @xmath32 is the fraction of electromagnetic energy . from this @xmath33 and @xmath34    for a combined calorimeter the incident energy deposits into the lar compartment , @xmath35 , the tile calorimeter compartment , @xmath36 , and into the passive material between the lar and tile calorimeters , @xmath37 , @xmath38    using the expressions ( [ ev16 ] )  ( [ ev13 ] ) the following equation for",
    "the energy reconstruction has been derived : @xmath39 where @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ; @xmath42 are from equation ( [ ev10 ] ) and @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note , that for @xmath47 of events an energy in tile calorimeter is approximately equal to beam energy because a hadronic shower began in the hadron calorimeter .",
    "the term , which accounts for the energy loss in the dead material between the lar and tile calorimeters , @xmath37 , is taken to be proportional to the geometrical mean of the energy released in the third depth of the electromagnetic compartment ( @xmath48 ) and the first depth of the hadronic compartment ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 similar to @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been tested by the monte carlo simulation and by the study of the correlation between the energy released in the midsampler and the cryostat energy deposition @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath51 obtained on the basis of the results of the monte carlo simulation is used .    in order to use the equation ( [ ev7 ] )",
    "it is necessary to know the values of the following constants : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , some of which are @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the determination of the other constants ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) is given below .",
    "for the determining of the @xmath54 constant the following procedure was applied .",
    "we selected the events which start to shower only in the hadronic calorimeter . to select these events",
    "the energies deposited in each sampling of the lar calorimeter and in the midsampler are required to be compatible with that of a single minimum ionization particle .",
    "the following expression for the normalized hadronic response have been used @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the tile calorimeter response corrected on the energy loss in the lar calorimeter , @xmath61 is determined by the formula ( [ fpt ] ) . the value of @xmath54 obtained by fitting is equal to @xmath62 .      using the expression ( [ ev7 ] ) the value of the @xmath63 ratio",
    "can be obtained @xmath64 the @xmath55 ratio and the function @xmath65 ( [ efpl ] ) can be inferred from the energy dependent @xmath66 ratios .",
    "for this case we select the events with the well developed hadronic showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "than mean that energy depositions were required to be more than 10% of the beam energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and less than 70% in the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "[ fv2 ] shows the distributions of the @xmath66 ratio derived by formula ( [ ev1 ] ) for different energies .",
    "the mean values of these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fv3 ] as a function of the beam energy .",
    "the fit of this distribution by the expression ( [ ev10 ] ) for lar calorimeter yields @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the quoted errors are the statistical ones obtained from the fit . the systematic error on the @xmath55 ratio , which is a consequence of the uncertainties in the input constants used in the equation ( [ ev1 ] ) ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath69 .",
    "wigmans showed @xcite that the @xmath0 ratio for non - uranium calorimeters with high - z absorber material is satisfactorily described by the formula : @xmath70 in which @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the calorimeter response to e.m.showers and to mev - type neutrons , respectively .",
    "these responses are normalized to the one for minimum ionizing particles .",
    "the monte carlo calculated @xmath71 and @xmath72 values for the r&d3 pb - lar electromagnetic calorimeter are @xmath73 @xcite and @xmath74 @xcite leading to @xmath75 .",
    "our measured value of the @xmath55 ratio agrees with this prediction .      for the energy reconstruction by the formula ( [ ev7 ] ) it is necessary to know the @xmath76 ratio and the reconstructed energy itself .",
    "therefore , the iteration procedure has been developed .",
    "two iteration cycles were made : the first one is devoted to the determination of the @xmath76 ratio and the second one is the energy reconstruction itself .",
    "the expression ( [ ev10 ] ) for the @xmath76 ratio can be written as @xmath77 as the first approximation , the value of @xmath76 is calculated using the equation ( [ epti ] ) where in the right side of this equation we used @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath79 .",
    "the iteration process is stopped when the convergence criterion @xmath80 , where ( @xmath81 ) , is satisfied .",
    "as the first approximation in the iteration cycle for the energy reconstruction , the value of @xmath27 is calculated using the equation ( [ ev7 ] ) with the @xmath76 ratio obtained in the first iteration cycle and @xmath66 from equation ( [ ev10 ] ) where in the right side of this equation we used @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "the convergence criterion is @xmath84 .    for",
    "both these case the iteration values are under the logarithmic function that mean that iteration procedure will be very fast .",
    "the average numbers of iterations @xmath85 for the various beam energies needed to receive the given value of accuracy @xmath86 have been investigated .",
    "it turned out , it is sufficiently only the first approximation for achievement , on average , of convergence with an accuracy of @xmath87 for energies 80  150 @xmath88 and it is necessary to perform only one iteration for the energies at 10  50 @xmath88 and 300 @xmath88 .",
    "we specially investigated the accuracy of the first approximation of energy .",
    "[ f03 - 0 ] shows the comparison between the energy linearities , the mean values of @xmath89 , obtained using the iteration procedure with @xmath90 ( black circles ) and the first approximation of energy ( open circles ) .",

    "[ f03 ] demonstrates the correctness of the mean energy reconstruction .",
    "the mean value of @xmath89 is equal to @xmath94 and the spread is @xmath1 except for the point at 10 @xmath88 .",
    "but , as noted in @xcite , at this point the result is strongly dependent on the effective capability to remove events with interactions in the dead material upstream and to deconvolve the real pion contribution from the muon contamination .",
    "[ f03 ] also shows the comparison of the linearity , @xmath89 , as a function of the beam energy for the @xmath0 method and for the cells weighting method @xcite .",

    "the noise term of about @xmath103 is the same for these three methods that reflects its origin as the electronic noise .",
    "as to the two approaches for the @xmath0 method , the fitted parameters coincide within errors .",
