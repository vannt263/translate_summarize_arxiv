    "the age of precision cosmology is upon us , with concordance values of cosmological parameters placing us in an accelerating universe , composed primarily of dark energy ( @xmath073% ) , and dark matter ( @xmath023% ) , with a mere smattering of baryonic matter ( @xmath04% ) .",
    "the evolution of structure on large scales is driven by gravity , and such structures as clusters and filaments of galaxies are exceedingly well explained by the @xmath1cdm paradigm . yet on the scale galaxies , problems persist . in some sense",
    "this is not surprising , as on smaller scales , baryonic processes become important ; gas dynamics , star formation , quasars , active galactic nucleii , supernovae , shocks , and ram pressure are some of the processes that add complexity beyond gravity driven structure formation .",
    "our work is aimed at unravelling the major processes which determine how galaxies form within the context of hierarchical structure build .",
    "the recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk galaxies , and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages @xcite , means that the formation of the thick disk , perhaps more than any other component , holds the key to unraveling the evolution of the milky way , and indeed all disk galaxies . in an earlier study @xcite",
    ", we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas rich mergers , at high redshift .",
    "this hypothesis was based on comparing n - body / sph simulations to a variety of galactic and extragalactic observations , including stellar kinematics , ages and chemical properties .",
    "recently , the stellar populations in four nearby edge - on disk galaxies were resolved @xcite , and it was confirmed that thick disks are common features of spiral galaxies .",
    "thick disk populations of all galaxies in this sample are old and relatively metal rich , and no significant color gradient with height above the plane ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5/@xmath2z ) is apparent",
    ". these observations will provide further constraints to our thick disk formation scenario , which we probe in this study by examining how the ages and metallicties of our simulated thick disk stars vary with height above the plane .",
    "meanwhile , in a study of 34 edge - on disk galaxies in the hubble deep field @xcite , selected for apparent diameter larger than 1.3  and unperturbed morphology , it was shown that distant and local disk galaxies are globally similar in their relative thickness or flatness , as characterised by the ratio of scale - height to scale - length ( @xmath6/@xmath7 ) .",
    "disks at redshift @xmath8 are smaller , in absolute value , than present day disk galaxies , and have a flatness ratio , @xmath6/@xmath7 , only slightly larger , by a factor @xmath9 .",
    "we examine the evolution of our simulated disk galaxy in the epoch which follows thick disk formation , in light of these observations , to determine whether a choatic thick disk formation epoch is consistent with a galaxy whose structural parameters do not evolve much since around redshift 1 .",

    "we use the semi - cosmological version of gcd+ , with an isolated sphere of dark matter and gas as initial condition .",
    "small scale density fluctuations are superimposed on the sphere , parameterized by @xmath11 , which seed local collapse and subsequent star formation .",
    "solid - body rotation is imparted to the initial sphere to incorporate the effects of longer wavelength fluctuations . for the model described here ,",

    "this is sufficient to resolve the relatively large building blocks which we are interested in .",

    "we plot , in figure   [ mergers ] , the average number of `` building blocks '' versus lookback time for our 58 milky way sized dark matter halos . to qualify as a `` building block '' ,",

    "we report on a simulated disk galaxy , and match to recent observations of local and distant ( @xmath8 ) disk galaxies . in forming our simulated galaxy ,",
    "feedback and gas physics proved crucial ingredients @xcite in forming a realistic disk galaxy .",

    "the simulated disk galaxy is shown to have a thick disk component .",
    "this is evidenced by the velocity dispersion versus age relation for solar neighbourhood stars ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that the thick disk is created in an epoch of of multiple mergers of gas rich building blocks , during which a central galaxy is formed @xcite , and it was shown that such a scenario is consistent with present observations of the galactic and extragalactic thick disks .",
    "recently , observations of four edge - on galaxies explored properties of their stellar populations as a function of height @xcite .",
    "all showed thick disks composed of red stellar populations , which are old and metal rich .",
    "@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 colour gradients were seen to be zero or slighlty positive .",
    "these observations do not support thick disks which form through dissipative disk formation , accretion from shredded satllites , or slow heating of the thin disk .",
    "heating through galaxy interactions more than 3 gyrs ago are not ruled out . in figures",
    "[ f3 ] & [ f4 ] , we show the metallicity and age of the thick disk stars in our simulated galaxy .",
    "we see that our thick disk formation scenario results in stellar populations which can match the observations .",
    "although accretion from galactic `` building blocks '' are involved in our model , these accreted building blocks have high gas fraction .",
    "astration during and after murders , as well as ongoing disspiative infall of gas , eliminates differences in metallicity of original and accreting material .",
    "thus little metallicity gradient is seen in our simulated thick disk .",
    "the rapid star formation in this epoch ensures that thick disk stars are almost exclusively old , and a lack of gradient with height .    in a study of 34 edge - on disk galaxies in the hubble deep field @xcite",
    ", galaxies out to redshift@xmath01 were shown to have scale parameters similar to local disk galaxies .",
    "these parameters are characterised by the ratio of scale - height to scale - length ( @xmath6/@xmath7 ) .",
    "disks at redshift @xmath8 are smaller , in absolute value , than present day disk galaxies .",
    "however , their flatness ratio , @xmath6/@xmath7 , is only slightly larger , by a factor @xmath01.5 .",
    "we examine our simulated disk galaxy from a time after the thick disk formation epoch , when a late type galaxy has clearly formed .",
    "we derive a value of @xmath6/@xmath7 which is larger by a factor @xmath40 in our simulated galaxy at @xmath24 compared with the @xmath27 .",
    "thus , even though a chaotic period of merging which led to the emrergence of the thick disk was involved in the birth of our simulated disk galaxy , once a disk emerges , the global structure does not evolve to a large extent .",
