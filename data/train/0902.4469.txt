    "fu orionis systems are a class of exceptionally luminous young stellar objects found in star - forming regions ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) . originally identified from their very large increases in optical brightness over timescales of years or less ( herbig 1977 ) , a larger group of heavily extincted probable members of the class have been identified by their characteristic infrared spectra , which strongly differ from those of typical t tauri stars ( reipurth & aspin 1997 ; aspin & reipurth 2003 ; reipurth et al .",
    "additional support for the identification of these heavily embedded objects comes from recent high - resolution infrared spectroscopy , which indicates that many of these sources are rapidly rotating and exhibit double - peaked absorption line profiles as observed in fu ori ( greene , aspin , & reipurth 2008 ) .    the accretion disk model for fu ori objects ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 , and references therein ) rests fundamentally on the need to explain the peculiar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these objects , which are much broader than that of a single temperature blackbody or star , and which exhibit a continuously varying spectral type as a function of wavelength .",
    "the disk model naturally accounts for these properties , as observations at longer wavelengths probe increasingly cooler disk regions with later spectral types ; our detailed model for fu ori matches the sed from optical wavelengths to the mid - infrared region ( zhu et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , the disk model predicts that differential rotation should be observed , with slower rotation seen at longer wavelengths , which arise from outer disk radii , and this has been confirmed by comparing optical ( @xmath5 m ) and near - infrared ( @xmath0 m ) spectral line profiles ( hartmann & kenyon 1987a , b ; kenyon , hartmann , & hewett 1988 ) .",
    "a desirable feature in a model or theory is an ability to make predictions that can be tested observationally .",
    "the disk model predicts that the observed rotational spectral line broadening should be even smaller at @xmath6 m ( using the fundamental co vibrational transitions ) than at @xmath7 m ( using the first overtone co vibrational lines ) . in this paper",
    "we present a high - resolution spectrum of fu ori in the @xmath8 m region which matches the predictions of the disk model .",
    "we also show that some discrepancies seen in optical spectra of fu ori in comparison with simple disk models are alleviated by a decrease in the maximum disk temperature which we proposed in zhu et al .",
    "a high - resolution spectrum of fu ori at @xmath9 m was obtained at ut 01:00:29 on 2007 february 4 using the phoenix spectrometer ( hinkle et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2003 ) on the 8-m gemini south telescope .",
    "observations were taken with a two - pixel slit ( 0.17@xmath10@xmath10 ) for a resolution of @xmath11 over the wavelength range @xmath12 m .",
    "we observed fu ori at two positions along the slit for eight 2 minute exposures .",
    "we also observed the b2 iii star hr1790 for telluric line correction and took 10 flat - field and dark images .",
    "we reduced the data using iraf .",
    "we averaged the flat - field and dark images and subtracted the average dark image from the average flat - field image .",
    "this averaged , dark - subtracted flat - field image was then divided into the target spectra .",
    "images at different positions of the slit were differenced to remove the sky and dark backgrounds .",
    "we then extracted the spectra using the iraf @xmath13 routine and later combined and flattened the spectra using @xmath14 in iraf .",
    "the spectrum of the hot star hr1790 was used to divide out the telluric lines from the fu ori spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibration was computed using telluric lines from the arcturus atlas of hinkle et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we also obtained a high - resolution spectrum of fu ori at ut 17:59:15 on 2008 november 14 using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory ( bernstein et al .",
    "mike is a double echelle spectrograph which delivers full wavelength coverage from about @xmath15    ( blue side ) and @xmath16     ( red side ) .",
    "the data were obtained in subarcsecond seeing with a 0.7slit , binning 2x2 and an exposure time of 120s .",
    "the resolutions were @xmath4 40,000 and @xmath17 30,000 for the blue and red sides respectively .",
    "the mike data were reduced using the mike redux idl pipeline.burles/www/mike/ ]",
    "figure 1 shows the reduced phoenix spectrum of fu ori .",
    "strong telluric features mean that regions around wavenumber 2009.3 @xmath18 are not usable , and small residuals from the telluric correction can be seen at wavenumbers 2010.4 , 2010.9 , 2011.9 , and 2013.5 @xmath18 .",
    "the spike around wavenumber 2012.5 @xmath18 is due to a bad pixel . outside of these regions ,",
    "an absorption spectrum is clearly present , with relatively broad features and substantial blending .",
    "most of the lines are due to the p - branch of the fundamental rotational - vibrational transitions of co.    to interpret the results , we calculated a synthetic disk spectrum using the methods described by zhu et al .",
    "the model parameters were those used by zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to fit the sed of fu ori and to match the observed rotational broadening observed at optical and near - infrared wavelengths : central star mass @xmath4 0.3 m@xmath19 , mass accretion rate of the inner high @xmath20 disk @xmath42.4@xmath2110@xmath22 , disk inner radius @xmath45 @xmath23 , outer radius of the inner high @xmath20 disk @xmath4 1 au , and the disk inclination angle @xmath455@xmath24 .",
    "( see figure 8 of zhu et al .  for the fit to the @xmath7 m co lines ) .",
    "we emphasize that we have _ not _ changed or adjusted any parameters from the zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) fu ori model ; these are predicted spectra .    the lower dotted curve in figure 1 shows the synthetic disk spectrum observed pole - on , so that individual spectral lines can be seen without the blending that occurs due to the large rotational broadening .",
    "comparison of the nonrotating spectrum with the observations shows that fu ori has significantly larger line widths , consistent with rapid rotation , and unlike profiles of m giants and supergiants .",
    "the upper dotted curve shows the synthesized spectrum using the inclination and central mass used to obtain a match to the @xmath7 m co line widths .",
    "the agreement between synthetic and real spectra is quite good , except near @xmath25 where we are missing the co 5 - 4 p7 line in the model .",
    "this could be due to adopting too small an oscillator strength .",
    "the half - width at half - depth ( hwhd ) of the lines in this spectral region ( 5 @xmath26 m ) is @xmath27 , considerably smaller than the line widths measured at @xmath7 m ( hwhd @xmath4 36 km s@xmath28 ) ( hartmann & kenyon 1987a ; hartmann , hinkle , & calvet 2004 ; zhu et al .",
    "this hwhd at 5 @xmath26 m is close to the keplerian velocity at 0.5 au around 0.3 m@xmath19 central star .",
    "all the strong lines have been identified in the pole - on model spectrum .",
    "though some water lines are present in this spectrum , they are washed out or blended in the broadened spectrum ( upper dotted curve ) .",
    "only the strong co fundamental lines can be identified with certainty .",
    "it is also worth noting that some of the unblended line profiles exhibit evidence for double - peaked shapes predicted by simple disk models ( e.g. , hartmann & kenyon 1987a , b ) .",
    "in addition , some of the blends show sharp features ( eg . 2011.2 cm@xmath28 line ) which are the result of overlapping double - peaked lines .",
    "these features naturally arise in a disk model but would not be seen in rotating star models ( unless large polar spots are invoked ; see below ) .    in figure 2",
    "we display a segment of the mike spectrum of fu ori in the wavelength range @xmath30    for comparison with the synthetic keplerian disk spectrum .",
    "we again find good agreement between model and observation , demonstrating that there has been no change in the estimated optical rotational velocity of the object between the observations in zhu et al .",
    "2007 , which we used to set the disk parameters , and this paper .",
    "the hwhd of the optical lines in this wavelength range is @xmath465@xmath315 km s@xmath28 , consistent with hwhd @xmath4 62@xmath315 km s@xmath28 measured by petrov & herbig ( 2008 ; ph08 ) .",
    "thus , compared with hwhd of 2 micron co first - overtone lines @xmath4 36@xmath313 km s@xmath28 and hwhd of 5 micron co fundamental lines @xmath4 22@xmath312 km s@xmath28 , the differential rotation in fu ori observed over nearly an order of magnitude in wavelength is consistent with keplerian rotation . the slow rotation observed at @xmath8 m implies spectral formation at radii out to @xmath32  au , in agreement with our sed modeling ; this supports our conclusion in zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) that the extent of the high - accretion rate disk is larger than can be explained by pure thermal instability models for outbursts @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the variation of rotational velocities as observed over to @xmath33 m with keplerian rotation seemingly provides strong evidence for the accretion disk interpretation of fu ori .",
    "however , ph08 recently argued that while the infrared spectrum is that of an accretion disk , the optical spectrum is produced by a rapidly - rotating star with a dark polar spot .",
    "the ph08 argument against a pure disk model for a central star rests on three main points : there is no evidence for a variation of absorption line width as a function of excitation potential over the wavelength range @xmath34 m ; there is no evidence for a variation of rotational velocity with wavelength over that wavelength range ; and the observed line profiles are more `` boxy '' or flat - bottomed than the double - peaked profiles of the disk model .",
    "it is important to recognize that the above - listed effects expected for a disk spectrum require not only differential rotation but a temperature gradient as well .",
    "a keplerian disk exhibiting a constant effective temperature would not show any effect of rotational velocity with either excitation or wavelength ; and the double - peaked behavior of line profiles only occurs because the outer , slowly rotating regions do not fill in the profile at line center , as these regions are too cool to emit significantly at the wavelength of observation . while the standard steady disk temperature distribution @xmath35 r^{-3}$ ] is a power law at large radii",
    ", it is relatively flat at distances within about twice the inner radius @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , observations at long wavelengths which probe the outer disk where the temperature falls rapidly with radius will exhibit stronger rotational velocity variations and more double - peaked line profiles than observations at short wavelengths probing the inner , more nearly isothermal disk .    in zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we were forced to use a maximum disk temperature @xmath37  k to match the sed of fu ori , which is lower than the 7200 k maximum temperature adopted in the model used by ph08 ( which was based on the earlier model by kenyon , hartmann , & hewett 1988 ) .",
    "lowering the maximum temperature has the effect of making the flatter part of the accretion disk temperature distribution more dominant at optical wavelengths . as shown in table 1 and figure 3 , this model predicts essentially no variation of line width with lower level excitation potential and a very slight dependence on wavelength in the optical region .",
    "( note that ph08 predict a much larger effect of line width on excitation potential than welty et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for what should be essentially the same disk model ; the reason for the large discrepancy is unclear . ) in any case , measurement of rotation is best done through cross - correlation using suitable templates , as many of the lines used by ph08 are blends and introduce very large scatter into the model predictions ( see table 1 and figure 3 ) .",
    "ph08 also noted that their disk model predicts very strong tio absorption bands at @xmath38 and @xmath39    which are not observed .",
    "however , as shown in figure 2 , our lower - temperature disk model does not predict strong tio absorption bands in this region .",
    "in addition there is evidence for @xmath39    bandhead absorption in our mike spectra , at the level predicted by our disk model .",
    "once again this difference in the predicted disk model spectra arises simply by reducing the maximum disk temperature , which increases the importance of hot inner disk relative to the outer cool disk at the wavelength of observation .",
    "it has long been known that many optical line profiles in fu ori are less double - peaked than predicted by simple quiescent disk models ( hartmann & kenyon 1985 ) .",
    "there are , however , alternative possibilities to explain the profiles which do not demand abandonment of the accretion disk hypothesis .",
    "if , as currently thought , ionized disks accrete through the action of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1998 ) , such disks must be turbulent .",
    "the disk models with resolved vertical structure computed by miller & stone ( 2000 ) predict that turbulence driven by the mri in the central layers of the disk produces waves which propagate outward and shock in the upper layers .",
    "it would be surprising if the mri did not produce significant turbulent motions in the upper atmospheric layers of the disk , which would tend to wash out the double profile structure .",
    "hartmann , hinkle , & calvet ( 2004 ) found that that some mildly supersonic turbulence was needed to explain the @xmath40co first - overtone lines of fu ori .",
    "it should be noted that the standard steady disk structure may not be completely applicable in the innermost disk .",
    "standard thin - disk models predict that accretion onto a slowly rotating star should give rise to boundary - layer emission with roughly half the system luminosity ; this is not observed in fu ori ( kenyon et al .  1989 ) .",
    "popham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) considered disk models which suppress boundary layer radiation ; such models exhibit less doubled line profiles in inner disk regions , largely because the angular velocity of the disk departs from keplerian values near the inner disk boundary .    to explain the optical spectrum of fu ori with a central star",
    ", the star would be required to have essentially the same total system luminosity @xmath41 , and would need to have a radius roughly twice the inner radius of the disk model , @xmath42 ( zhu et al .  2007 ) .",
    "assuming keplerian rotation for the infrared disk ,",
    "zhu et al .  estimated a central mass @xmath43 .",
    "such a star can not be an isolated product of stellar evolution , as it has an implausibly short kelvin - helmholtz contraction time @xmath44  yr . the energy to power the star would have to come from disk accretion , which would also potentially explain the outburst ( larson 1983 ) .",
    "however , as the ratio of optical - to - infrared rotational velocities is consistent with a keplerian profile , this implies that any central star would have to be rotating nearly at breakup ; this means that the assumption of solid - body rotation in the ph08 model is unlikely to be correct .",
    "it is also unclear whether the accretion of a large amount of hot disk material would add enough angular momentum to spin up the outer layers of the star to breakup velocity as it expanded the outer atmosphere .    in summary , the accretion disk model for fu",
    "ori provides a coherent explanation of the observed spectral energy distribution and differential rotation over more than a decade in wavelength .",
    "the slow rotation observed at @xmath8 m supports our previous result that the high mass accretion rate disk could extend to @xmath45  au , which is significantly larger than that predicted by the pure thermal instability theory @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the theory incorporating both gravitational and magnetorotational @xcite successfully predicts au scale high mass accretion rate inner disk during outbursts @xcite . with the advent of more powerful computers and sophisticated magnetohydrodynamic codes , and the assumption of mri - driven accretion",
    ", it should be possible to explore the possibility that atmospheric turbulence and/or nonstandard inner thin disk structure can explain details of the optical line profiles .",
