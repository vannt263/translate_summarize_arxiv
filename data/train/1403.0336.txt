    "a major shift in the field of thermodynamics in the last century was from idealized equilibrium processes to natural irreversible processes [ 1 - 4].chemical reactions continue to play a pivotal role in this development and provide significant motivation in studying the non - equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems _ in vitro _ as well as _ in vivo _ [ 5 - 10 ] . since a closed system always tends to thermodynamic equilibrium ( te ) , a natural generalization in the theory of irreversible thermodynamics has been achieved via the concept of a steady state @xcite . in this regard , the quantity of primary importance is the entropy production rate ( epr ) @xcite .",
    "the epr vanishes for a closed system in the long - time limit that reaches a true te . on the other hand , epr is positive definite for a steady state that can emerge in an _ open _ system .",
    "the easiest way to model such a system in the context of chemical reactions is to assume that concentrations of some of the reacting species are held fixed @xcite . under this condition , aptly known as the chemiostatic condition @xcite , epr tends to a non - zero constant , reflecting a steady dissipation rate ( sdr ) to sustain the system away from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the corresponding steady state is denoted as the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) @xcite .",
    "this concept has been extensively used in analyzing single - molecule kinetic experiments @xcite .",
    "the ness also includes the te as a special case when detailed balance ( db ) is obeyed @xcite , thus providing a very general framework .",
    "recently , an important progress was made in the theory and characterization of ness , considering a master equation formalism @xcite .",
    "these studies have established that the classification of ness requires _ not only _ the steady distribution ( as in te ) but _ also _ the stationary fluxes or probability currents .",
    "this approach enables one to identify _ all possible _ combinations of transition rates that ultimately lead the system to the _ same _ ness .",
    "however , these nesss in general have different values of the epr , and hence the sdr .",
    "this proposition prompts one to check ( i ) how states with the same epr at ness can be generated and ( ii ) whether there exist ways to distinguish these states . here",
    ", we shall address both the issues by considering an enzyme - catalyzed reaction under chemiostatic condition . expressing the epr as a function of experimentally measurable reaction rate , we emphasize also",
    "that , the quantity that identifies the various nesss having the same epr is linked with the enzyme efficiency , a useful measure that is expressible in terms of enzyme kinetic constants .",
    "the basic scheme of enzyme catalysis within the michaelis - menten ( mm ) framework with reversible product formation step is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . under chemiostatic condition ,",
    "@xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] are kept constant by continuous injection and withdrawal , respectively .",
    "this is the simplest model to mimic an open reaction system . unlike the usual case of full enzyme recovery with total conversion of substrate into product in a closed system , here both the concentrations of free enzyme e and the enzyme - substrate complex",
    "es reach a steady value . also , instead of the rate of product formation , the progress of reaction is characterized by the rate of evolution of @xmath2 $ ] ( or @xmath3 $ ] ) .",
    "we define the pseudo - first - order rate constants as @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5.$ ] concentration of e is denoted by @xmath6 and that of es is given by @xmath7 we have then @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a constant that stands for the total enzyme concentration",
    ". then the rate of the reaction , @xmath10 , is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 with the initial condition , @xmath13 , the time - dependent solution is given as @xmath14 the steady state enzyme concentration corresponds to the long - time limit of eq.([ct ] ) : @xmath15 at any steady state , we thus note @xmath16      the fluxes of the reaction system are defined pairwise as @xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 from eq.([const ] ) , eq.([remm ] ) , eq.([j1 ] ) and eq.([j2 ] ) , one gets @xmath19 at the steady state , eq.([rateflx ] ) leads to @xmath20 an ness is characterized by a non - zero flux , @xmath21 . at te ,",
    "the fluxes vanish for both the reactions .",
    "one may note , then the system satisfies db .    the conjugate forces of the fluxes given in eqs ( [ j1])-([j2 ] ) are defined as @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 corresponding to the scheme depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , the epr is then given by @xcite @xmath24 we set here ( and henceforth ) the boltzmann constant @xmath25 . in the present case ,",
    "the steady value of epr becomes @xmath26 therefore , unless the substrate and the product take part in equilibrium , the reaction system reaches an ness with a sdr equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the problem is now transparent .",
    "if the rate constants become different , the steady concentrations will also differ .",
    "but , one can adjust them in such a way that @xmath27 remains the same . in these situations",
    ", one needs an additional parameter to distinguish these states . to proceed ,",
    "we define a small deviation in @xmath6 around ness as @xmath28 it then follows from eq.([const ] ) that @xmath29 from eq.([remm ] ) and eq.([delmm1 ] ) , the reaction rate becomes @xmath30 now , putting eqs ( [ j1])-([f2 ] ) and eqs ( [ delmm1])-([vnsmm ] ) in eq.([eprmm ] ) and taking only the first terms of the logarithmic parts , we obtain the epr close to ness as @xmath31 here @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 as @xmath10 vanishes at any steady state , the sdr at ness is given by @xmath35 however , at te , @xmath36 one may check that here db holds : @xmath37 inspection of eq.([eprmm1 ] ) reveals that , near ness , @xmath38 varies _ linearly _ with @xmath10 with a slope @xmath39 .",
    "thus , while @xmath40 distinguishes an ness from a true te , @xmath39 plays the same role in identifying systems with the _ same _ sdr but having _ different _ time profiles .",
    "in this section , we consider various situations where the reaction system reaches ness with the same sdr . focusing on eq.([x3 ] ) , the different cases that keep @xmath40 invariant are discussed next .",
    "case a : any parent choice of rate constants .",
    "case b : only @xmath41 and @xmath42 are exchanged .",
    "case c : only @xmath43 and @xmath44 are exchanged .",
    "case d : both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are exchanged .",
    "case e : both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are exchanged .",
    "case f : both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are exchanged .",
    "case g : @xmath41 changed to @xmath51 , @xmath43 changed to @xmath52 , @xmath42 changed to @xmath53 and @xmath44 changed to @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 it can be easily verified that cases d and e possess not only identical @xmath40 but also the same @xmath39 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is true for cases a and f as well .",
    "so , we do not consider cases e and f any further . a simple explanation of the equivalence is given in fig.[fig2 ] schematically , based on reflection symmetry .      to explore the characteristics of various cases given above",
    ", we take the rate constants from the single molecule experimental study of english _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the _ escherichia coli _ @xmath57-galactosidase enzyme .",
    "they are as follows : @xmath58 e07 @xmath59 e04 @xmath60 e02 @xmath61 we clarify that , in their study @xcite , @xmath42 had actually been shown to be a fluctuating quantity with a distribution .",
    "however , only an _ average _ value of @xmath42 will suffice our purpose .",
    "the constant substrate concentration is set at @xmath0=1.0 $ ] e02 @xmath62 and thus , @xmath4 = 5.0 $ ] e03 @xmath63 .",
    "we choose @xmath64 e-05 @xmath63 to make the reaction scheme almost identical to the conventional mm kinetics . here",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 with magnitudes given above represents the parent choice of rate constants , _",
    "i.e. _ , case a. the value of the constant @xmath67 e01 , in case g.    the time - evolution of epr @xmath38 , determined using both the exact ( eq.([eprmm ] ) ) and the approximate ( eq.([eprmm1 ] ) ) expressions , are shown in fig.[fig3 ] , for the various cases .",
    "the concentrations @xmath68 are made dimensionless by scaling with respect to the total enzyme concentration @xmath9 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath38 has the unit of @xmath63 . from the figure ,",
    "it is evident that eq.([eprmm1 ] ) nicely approximates the behavior near ness .",
    "specifically , the curves of exact and approximate cases merge quite well for any @xmath69 e-04 s.    the evolution of reaction rate @xmath10 is shown in fig.[fig4 ] for all the distinct cases .",
    "the curves are displayed over a time - span where eq.([eprmm1 ] ) is valid , as mentioned above .",
    "this gives us a quantitative understanding of the magnitude of @xmath10 up to which the _ close to _ ness approximation , and hence eq.([eprmm1 ] ) , is valid .",
    "we note the variation of @xmath38 as a function of @xmath10 in all the relevant cases in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "both the exact ( fig.[fig5](a ) ) as well as the approximate results ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) are shown .",
    "two features are interesting .",
    "first , in all the situations , the system reaches an ness with identical @xmath70 e03 @xmath63 .",
    "secondly , the quantity that distinguishes one case from the other is the slope @xmath39 of @xmath38 vs. @xmath10 curve near the ness",
    ". this slope can be positive as well as negative .",
    "one may like to next investigate the role of the rate constants in governing the overall dissipation in various cases . specifically",
    ", we like to enquire if the efficiency of the enzyme has anything to do with the total dissipation . in this context",
    ", it may be recalled that , the conventional mm kinetics requires the rate constant @xmath44 to be negligible compared with the others .",
    "so , the enzyme kinetic constants , like the mm constant @xmath71 and catalytic efficiency @xmath72 , are meaningful in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "our choice of parent rate constants ensures that in case a , the system follows mm kinetics .",
    "case b , which leaves @xmath44 unchanged and case g , which changes @xmath44 to @xmath54 ( with @xmath74 e01 ) , can also be included within the mm scheme .",
    "but , cases c to f , which exchange @xmath44 with any one of the other bigger rate constants , can not follow the usual mm kinetics . therefore , we focus on cases a , b and g in finding any possible connection between the kinetic constants of the enzyme and the total dissipation .",
    "while the sdr @xmath27 is the same for all of them , the time - integrated epr , giving the total entropy production , is different .",
    "we define it as @xmath75 the upper limit @xmath76 is fixed at such a time when all the systems reach ness .",
    "in the present set of cases , we find that setting @xmath77 e-03 s is satisfactory .",
    "the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( determined by integrating @xmath38 from eq.([eprmm ] ) ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] , along with the slope @xmath39 [ see eq.([eprmm1 ] ) ] .",
    "it is clear from the data that , in going from case a to case g , @xmath80 gradually increases , whereas @xmath81 falls .",
    "both these features indicate that the enzyme becomes _ less efficient_. more interesting is to note that the corresponding @xmath79 values also exhibit a decreasing trend from case a to case g. thus , we can say that , with identical sdr , the more efficient enzyme ( bigger @xmath81 and smaller @xmath80 ) involves higher _ total _ dissipation .",
    "this can be rationalized by the fact that , higher efficiency corresponds to a _",
    "faster _ conversion of substrate into product .",
    "this implies an increased irreversibility in the process .",
    "consequently , a higher entropy production is noted .",
    ".values of the quantities @xmath39 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath79 for cases a , b and g. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    before ending this section , we mention briefly the fate of the different situations when db , eq.([db ] ) , gets satisfied",
    ". in this scenario , whatever be the values of the rate constants , the final epr is trivially zero as the reaction system reaches te [ see eq.([epreq ] ) ] .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath39 also becomes zero [ see eq.([y3 ] ) ] .",
    "however , it follows from eq.([eprmm1 ] ) that , epr varies _ quadratically _ with @xmath10 near te .",
    "then , in principle , @xmath56 _ can _ distinguish systems reaching te .",
    "it is easy to see from eq.([z3 ] ) that , cases a , b and g possess different values for @xmath56 and hence they can be identified by following the behavior of epr with the reaction rate .",
    "the mm kinetics , shown in fig.[fig1 ] , with a single intermediate in the form of the es complex , is _ exactly _ solvable .",
    "we now generalize this scheme to an enzyme catalysis reaction having n number of species .",
    "these include the free enzyme e and ( n-1 ) intermediates , under similar chemiostatic condition as discussed in section ii .",
    "the reaction scheme is depicted in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "essentially , the species @xmath82 refer to the various conformers of the enzyme - substrate complex .",
    "the corresponding rate equations are given as @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the concentration of species @xmath85 at time @xmath86 .",
    "the following periodic boundary conditions hold : @xmath87 @xmath88 we have set @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath89.$ ] the flux @xmath90 due to the i - th reaction is defined as @xmath91 the expression of epr then becomes @xmath92      it is generally not possible to solve the set of coupled equations analytically for a system of arbitrary size .",
    "however , again focusing on a situation close to the ness , one can get some insights .",
    "for that purpose , we define small deviations in species concentrations from their respective ness values as @xmath93 for a short time interval @xmath76 , using finite difference approximation , one gets @xmath94 putting eqs ( [ del])-([del1 ] ) in eq.([dai ] ) , we get @xmath95 as the reactions are coupled , so the @xmath96s are related to each other and can be expressed in terms of any one of them , say @xmath97 then , one can write @xmath98 next we will discuss the scheme to determine the @xmath99s .",
    "the set of coupled equations ( [ delness ] ) , with the help of eq.([relatn ] ) , can be cast in the matrix form @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a @xmath102 matrix with @xmath103 and @xmath104 is a @xmath105 matrix with the property @xmath106 @xmath107 the non - zero matrix elements are @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 from eq.([mat ] ) and eq.([matel ] ) , we obtain a recursion relation @xmath111 with the boundary conditions : @xmath112 the first of the relations becomes @xmath113 then , it is easy to follow from eq.([recur ] ) that , all the other @xmath114s can be expressed in terms of @xmath115 from the condition @xmath116 we get @xmath117 and using eq.([relatn ] ) , we have @xmath118 from eqs ( [ matel1])-([recur1 ] ) and eq.([sumf ] ) , one can determine the @xmath99s in eq.([relatn ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to explore the epr near the ness . from eq.([dai ] ) , we have @xmath119 at ness . as we have chosen to express all the deviations in concentration from the ness in terms of @xmath120 ,",
    "so we take the reaction rate as @xmath121 .",
    "then , from eq.([dai ] ) with @xmath122 and using eq.([relatn ] ) along with the periodic boundary conditions , we get near ness @xmath123 where @xmath124 now putting eq.([del ] ) , eq.([relatn ] ) , eq.([jns ] ) and eq.([vns ] ) in eq.([eprc ] ) and also using the smallness of @xmath96s , the epr near ness becomes @xmath125 @xmath126 with @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 eq.([epr1 ] ) is the generalized version of eq.([eprmm1 ] ) , confirming that expression of the epr as a functional of reaction rate possesses a universal character .",
    "the next task is , whether states having the same sdr , _",
    "i.e. _ , identical @xmath130 , can be generated for the n - cycle .",
    "an obvious clue comes from the invariance of a cycle under rotation .",
    "thus , if the steady concentrations @xmath131 are represented as n points uniformly placed on a circle , then rotations by an angle @xmath132 , defined as @xmath133 will just redistribute the @xmath131 values .",
    "this keeps the steady flux @xmath134 in eq.([x1 ] ) unchanged .",
    "therefore , for a n - cycle , there are _ at least _ ( n-1 ) ways to interchange the rate constants @xmath135 that will lead the reaction system to states with the same sdr .",
    "we illustrate this result here by taking the simplest non - trivial case of a triangular network as an example .",
    "one can see from eq.([ang ] ) that , for a triangular network with @xmath136 , _ at least _ two kinds of changes of the rate constants keep the sdr unchanged .",
    "they are given below :    case 1 .",
    "any parent choice of rate constants .",
    "case 2 . change @xmath137 with the boundary condition @xmath138 .",
    "case 3 . change @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    one can generate additional ways to keep @xmath130 fixed with some added constraints on the rate constants .",
    "two pairs of situations [ cases 4 and 5 , and 6 and 7 ] are the following :    case 4 .",
    "any parent choice of rate constants with @xmath142 .",
    "change @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "any parent choice of rate constants with @xmath149 .",
    "change @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "+ all the above variants have been numerically studied and shown in fig.[fig7 ] where the epr , determined exactly by eq.([eprc ] ) , is plotted as a function of reaction rate @xmath121 for each of the cases .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the sdr are identical for the respective bunch of cases .",
    "but they can be distinguished by following the @xmath156 vs. @xmath10 curve in the small-@xmath10 regime .",
    "in summary , the present endeavor has been to characterize steady states with the same non - zero sdr .",
    "we have found that the variation of epr with the reaction rate near completion of the reaction is a nice indicator to distinguish such states .",
    "particularly important is the role of the slope of @xmath38 vs. @xmath10 curve near @xmath157 .",
    "this has been substantiated by studying enzyme - catalysed reactions as an exactly - solvable test case .",
    "we have also noticed , the leading term that accounts for the variation depends on the rate constants , more specifically on the enzyme efficiency .",
    "it is gratifying to observe that the more efficient enzyme incurs higher total dissipation .",
    "the physical appeal is immediate .",
    "a more efficient enzyme approaches the steady state more quickly .",
    "this implies the process becomes more irreversible .",
    "hence , @xmath79 becomes higher .",
    "one more notable point is the following .",
    "the sdr is equal to the steady heat dissipation rate .",
    "our study reveals that enzymes with very different efficiencies can show the same heat dissipation rate at steady state .",
    "an extension to cases of higher complexities involving various conformers of the enzyme - substrate complex has also been envisaged .",
    "further studies along this line on enzymes with multiple sites may be worthwhile .",
