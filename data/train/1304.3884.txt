    "<S> for the special spine dual to a triangulation , a branching is precisely a structure of _ oriented branched surface _ ( see williams  @xcite ) , and this structure was used in  @xcite to define a trivialization of the tangent bundle of @xmath0 along the @xmath8-skeleton of the spine , whence a spin structure on @xmath0 , using constructions already proposed by ishii  @xcite and christy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the construction just described easily extends to pairs @xmath5 with @xmath0 a compact oriented @xmath1-manifold with non - empty boundary and @xmath4 a spin structure on @xmath0 , using _ </S>",
    "<S> branchable _ triangulations of @xmath0 with _ ideal _ vertices at the components of @xmath3 , and possibly internal internal vertices . </S>",
    "<S> this approach however suffers from the drawback that not all triangulations of @xmath0 are branchable : for instance , the canonical triangulation by two regular hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra of the hyperbolic one - cusped manifold called the `` figure - eight - knot - sister '' is not branchable . on one hand , </S>",
    "<S> one easily sees that any triangulation of @xmath0 has branchable subdivisions ( _ e.g. _ , take a regular subdivision and define a branching by choosing a total ordering of the vertices ) . on the other hand , in many circumstances one is interested in sticking to a given triangulation of @xmath0 , or to consider the class of all vertex - efficient triangulations of @xmath0 ( namely , the purely ideal triangulations for non - empty @xmath3 , and the @xmath8-vertex triangulations for closed @xmath0 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , generalized versions of the notion of branching ( see the definitions below ) , with the nice property of existing on _ every _ triangulation , have emerged as useful devices to deal with simplicial formulas defined over triangulations equipped with solutions of thurston s @xmath9 consistency equations ( or variations of them  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , motivated by his work in progress on the entropy of solutions of the homogeneous @xmath10 thurston equations , luo introduced the notion of @xmath11-taut structure on a triangulation , and it turns out that a certain notion of _ weak branching _ , widely employed below together with the underlying notion of _ pre - branching _ </S>",
    "<S> , easily allows to show that every triangulation admits @xmath11-taut structures ( see remark  [ taut : rem ] ) . as another example </S>",
    "<S> , the same notions of weak and pre - branching were exploited in  @xcite to extend the construction of quantum hyperbolic invariants  @xcite to an arbitrary hyperbolic one - cusped manifold , over a canonical zariski - open set of the geometric component of its character variety .    in several instances </S>",
    "<S> luo  @xcite suggested that a combinatorial encoding of spin structures based on arbitrary triangulations might be of use for the construction of spin - refined invariants obtained from simplicial formulas as those mentioned in the previous paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> in this note we provide such a presentation , using the notion of weak branching already alluded to .    </S>",
    "<S> the results established in this paper provide an `` objects / moves '' combinatorial presentation of the set of all pairs @xmath5 , with @xmath0 a compact oriented @xmath1-manifold and @xmath4 a spin structure on @xmath0 , in the following sense :    * given any ( loose ) triangulation @xmath2 of @xmath0 , with ideal vertices at the components of @xmath3 and possibly internal vertices , and any @xmath4 , we encode @xmath4 by decorating @xmath2 with certain extra combinatorial structures ; * we exhibit combinatorial moves on decorated triangulations relating to each other any two that encode the same @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that all our moves are explicitly described , but one of them has an intrinsically global nature . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> in the second part of the paper we will show that this move can actually be replaced , in a suitable sense , by a combination of local ones . </S>",
    "<S> this last result is subtle and technically quite demanding , it is based on some non - trivial algebraic constructions , and it unveils unexpected coherence properties of the graphic calculus we use to encode weakly branched triangulations .    a first application of the technology developed in the present note appears in  @xcite , where our results are used to solve a sign indeterminacy in the phase anomaly of the quantum hyperbolic invariants ( see remark  [ sign ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that adapting the arguments of  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * chapter 8) , the results of this article can be used to provide an effective construction of the roberts spin - refined turaev - viro invariants  @xcite , and of the related blanchet spin - refined reshetikhin - turaev invariants  @xcite of the double of a manifold . </S>"
