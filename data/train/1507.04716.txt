    "small - angle scattering ( sas ; x - ray , neutron , light )  @xcite is one of the most used ( and quite often , the only possible ) method for direct determination of structural properties between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . since in many investigated micro - objects the presence of certain types of self - similar patterns has been clearly established , such as in various biological and magnetic structures  @xcite , semiconductors  @xcite or elastomeric membranes  @xcite , the natural framework able to describe the scaling behavior is fractal geometry  @xcite .    using deterministic fractal models in performing analytical treatment of experimental sas data with a _",
    "single _ power - law decay allows us to obtain additional information ( fractal form / structure factor , radius of gyration , number of particles inside the fractal , scaling factors )  @xcite .",
    "however , numerous examples of experimental sas data are characterized by a _",
    "succession _ of power - law decays with decreasing values of scattering exponents  @xcite , and it was not until recently when it was shown that such a succession can be described in terms of fat fractal structures ( fractals with positive lebesgue measure )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is two - fold : first , to present the underlying mechanisms leading to these behaviors ( single power - law vs. a succession of power - laws ) , and second to investigate under which conditions the self - similarity property of regular fractals can be inferred to fat fractals .",
    "a detailed description for the construction of regular and fat cantor fractals , as well as for regular vicsek fractals has been given in  @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize their main properties , present the construction of a fattened version of vicsek fractals and emphasize the differences between regular and fat fractals . in constructing a regular fractal",
    "we proceed as follows : we start with an initial cube of edge @xmath2 , called initiator ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the fractal iteration number ) which is divided into 27 smaller cubes with side length @xmath5 , with the scaling factor given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of the removed length .",
    "the fattened version of these regular fractals is obtained by considering that for @xmath8 we remove the fraction @xmath7 , for iterations @xmath9 we remove the fraction @xmath10 and so on , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the exponent @xmath13 is given by the formula @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting fractal is topologically equivalent to the regular version , but the holes decrease in size sufficiently fast so that , when @xmath15 , the fractal has nonzero and finite volume , and fractal dimension 3 .",
    "although the number of cubes at @xmath4-th iteration of the fat fractal is the same as in the case of regular fractal , in the former case the side length of each cube is @xmath16 and the scaling factor is given by @xmath17 , and whenever the quantity @xmath18 appears in the exponent , it is to be interpreted as an index and not as a power .",
    "( [ fig : fig1 ] ) shows the construction process of a generic @xmath19 deterministic regular and fat fractal based on the cantor set , for the first four iterations .",
    "since the scaling factor depends on the iteration , each scale will be characterized by a different fractal dimension , given by @xmath20 , and at each of this scale we shall have a power - law decay @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "fractal with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) : a ) thin ; b ) fat . ]",
    "since the deterministic fractal at the @xmath4-th iteration is composed of @xmath24 identical units with form factor @xmath25 , the form factor of the fractal can be written as  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a measure of the size of the fractal s units , @xmath28 is the fourier component of the density of the composing units of the fractal and @xmath29 are the center - of - mass positions of fractal s units .",
    "then , the intensity can be written as  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 . by definition",
    "the fractal structure factor is given by @xmath32 , and taking into account that the size of the fractal scattering unit is smaller than the minimal distance ( @xmath33 ) between the scattering units , then in the fractal region ( @xmath34 ) we have @xmath35 .",
    "the analytical expression for the fractal structure factor can be obtained by using the generative function  @xcite , which gives the positions of the units inside the fractal , and it can be written explicitly as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "since it is known that the fat fractal form factor at the @xmath4-th iteration can be written as @xmath39  @xcite , we can use this result to write an explicit expression for the fourier component of the density of fractal units @xmath40 . finally , we can write the fat fractal structure factor in the following form @xmath41 .    .",
    "black ( dark ) : regular fractal ; red ( gray ) : fat fractal ; horizontal dashed line : asymptotic values ; green ( light gray ) vertical lines : common positions of minima for both , regular and fat fractals ; black ( dark ) vertical dashed lines : positions of minima of regular fractals ; red ( gray ) vertical dotted lines : positions of minima of fat fractals . ]    for polydispersity , we consider here a log - normal distribution function @xmath42 which gives the probability of finding a fractal whose size is in the interval @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "therefore the polydisperse structure factor can be computed using ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical results at @xmath45 for both , monodisperse and polydisperse fractal structure factor , at fixed @xmath7 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] and respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we can observe that the monodisperse structure factor is characterized by three main regions on a double - logarithmic scale : a plateau in the range @xmath46 ( guinier region ) , _ a succession _ of generalized power - law decays at @xmath47 ( intermediate region ) and an asymptotic region at @xmath48 .",
    "the position of minima in the intermediate region are obtained when the fractal units interfere out of phase , and since the most common distances between the center of mass of the units are given by @xmath49 , imposing the condition @xmath50 , allows us to write the position of minima of the fat fractal structure factor ( green ; light gray and red ; dark gray ) vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] in the form @xmath51 .",
    "when all the scaling factors @xmath52 are equal , it gives the minima positions of the corresponding regular fractal ( black ( dark ) vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( see  @xcite ) .     and relative variance @xmath53 .",
    "black ( dark ) : regular fractal ; red ( gray ) : fat fractal ; horizontal dashed line : asymptotic values ; black ( gray ) dotted vertical line indicates the point where takes place the changes in the slopes of power - law decay . ]",
    "when the polydispersity is taken into account in calculating the fractal structure factor , the minima and maxima in the intermediate regions became smeared out ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) as expected and therefore the fat fractal structure factor ( red ; dark gray ) curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is characterized now by _ a succession _ of simple power - law decays with decreasing values of the scattering exponents , as seen in many sas experimental data .",
    "note that a succession of sas data with increasing values of scattering exponents can be described using multi - phase structures  @xcite .    in the asymptotic region the monodisperse and polydisperse fat fractal structure factor ( red ; dark gray ) curve ) is @xmath54 , and therefore the asymptotic values will tend to @xmath55 , as in the case of regular fractals ( black ( dark ) curves )  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a succession of power - law decays ( either simple or generalized ) of small - angle scattering data from fat fractals , arise as a result of a repeated increase of the scaling factor , after a finite number of iterations .",
    "in addition , for the iterations with identical values of the scaling factor we have shown that fat fractals resemble exactly the behavior of regular fractals , and therefore the former can be considered as self - similar for these iterations .",
    "the above findings have been illustrated by calculating the mono- and polydisperse scattering structure factors for a newly developed deterministic vicsek fat fractal ."
