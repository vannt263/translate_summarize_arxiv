    "[ h ]        we remark the following two facts about arc presentations of knots . like turning pages of a book",
    "we can rotate the page numbers of an arc presentation , so that if we turn @xmath72 number of pages for some integer @xmath72 then each page number @xmath32 goes to @xmath73 ( mod * @xmath26 ) . here",
    "@xmath24 ( mod * @xmath25 ) @xmath74 @xmath24 ( mod @xmath25 ) with one exception so that we use @xmath25 instead of @xmath75 .",
    "this changing is called _ page number rotating_. similarly we can also rotate binding points along the circular binding axis , so that for some integer @xmath50 each binding index @xmath45 goes to @xmath76 ( mod * @xmath26 ) .",
    "this rotation is easily understood when we relocate @xmath71 on a circular arc presentation of @xmath1 .",
    "this is call _ binding index rotating_. the middle and right figures in figure [ fig4 ] explain how these two rotations work .",
    "clearly both rotations do not change the knot @xmath1 .",
    "an arc presentation of @xmath1 is called _ star shaped _",
    "if it has an odd number of arc index @xmath26 and the difference between the two binding indices of the end points of every arc is always either @xmath50 or @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 , @xmath80 , be the arc whose binding points are @xmath43 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 ( mod * @xmath26 ) . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we give an example of a star shaped arc presentation of a knot .",
    "from now on @xmath1 is a nontrivial knot which is not trefoil knot . for convenience",
    "we just use @xmath45 instead of @xmath45 ( mod * @xmath26 ) for a binding index or a page number @xmath45 .",
    "we distinguish into two cases according to the shapes of its arc presentations .",
    "note that in a star shaped arc presentation every pair of arcs sharing one binding index has the property that the difference between the two binding indices at the other ends of these two arcs is either @xmath61 or @xmath57 .",
    "thus if @xmath1 has a non - star shaped arc presentation , there is a pair of arcs sharing one binding index , say @xmath84 , such that the difference between the two binding indices , say @xmath85 and @xmath86 , at the other ends of these two arcs is neither @xmath61 nor @xmath57 . without loss of generality",
    "@xmath85 , @xmath84 and @xmath86 appear in order to clockwise along the circular binding axis .",
    "after a proper binding index rotating these three indices go to @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath26 , respectively , so that @xmath89 . indeed @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "also we do a page number rotating so that the arc having binding indices @xmath87 and @xmath88 has the page number @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the page number of the other arc having binding indices @xmath88 and @xmath26 .",
    "see the figures in figure [ fig6 ] for better understanding .",
    "we slightly change the related lattice arc presentation so that only the arc , say @xmath30 , with the page number @xmath61 lies above the line @xmath41 .",
    "this does not change the knot @xmath1 because the arc @xmath30 does not cross the other part of @xmath1 when rotating it @xmath31 around the binding axis .",
    "now repeat the whole part of the proof of theorem [ thm:-2 ] .",
    "remark that both end points of the arc @xmath30 are not the binding points @xmath33 and @xmath92 since @xmath89",
    ". then we get a lattice stick presentation of @xmath1 with @xmath93 sticks .",
    "still we have a free space to move @xmath30 up or down through the @xmath21-axis without crossing any other arcs .",
    "lift it up till it reaches the @xmath21-level @xmath32 , and replace the adjoined two @xmath21-sticks at the end points of @xmath30 by proper @xmath21-sticks .",
    "indeed the new @xmath24-stick of @xmath30 lies on the same line containing the @xmath24-stick of the other arc with the page number @xmath32 .",
    "this means that we can reduce the number of sticks by @xmath70 .",
    "first we consider the case that the page numbers of the arcs @xmath98 are in the order or reverse - order of their indices @xmath99 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that they are in the order .",
    "we may assume that @xmath100 has a page number @xmath61 after a proper page number rotating .",
    "for only @xmath101 we take the pair of arcs sharing each binding point @xmath43 and bend this pair inside the circular disk as in figure [ fig7 ] . then one can figure out that this knot is @xmath94-torus knot .",
    "if the page numbers are neither in the order nor reverse - order of their indices , then one would find some binding point @xmath43 such that the difference between the page numbers of the pair of arcs @xmath79 and @xmath102 adjoining at @xmath43 is neither @xmath50 nor @xmath77 .",
    "thus in a dual arc presentation there exists an arc such that the difference between the two binding indices at the end points of this arc is neither @xmath50 nor @xmath77 .",
