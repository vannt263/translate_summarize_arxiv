    "the faraday experiment consists of shaking vertically a container holding two immiscible fluids ( the lighter of which can be air ) thereby inducing oscillations of the fluids and the interface between them . beyond a certain threshold ,",
    "the interface can form many kinds of standing wave patterns , including crystalline patterns and others which are more complex .",
    "this phenomenon was first studied by @xcite who noticed that the vibration frequency of the interface was half that of the forcing .",
    "the results of faraday were confirmed by rayleigh @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out the first theoretical linear analysis of the faraday waves , restricted to inviscid fluids .",
    "they decomposed the fluid motion into normal modes of the container and showed that the evolution equation of each mode reduced to a mathieu equation whose stability diagram is well known .    in the 1990s ,",
    "new behaviours of the interface were discovered , such as quasi - crystalline eight - fold patterns seen by @xcite . by introducing a forcing which is the sum of two periodic functions with commensurable frequencies , @xcite were able to produce twelve - fold quasi - patterns .",
    "triangular patterns were observed by @xcite and superlattice patterns by @xcite , also using two - frequency forcing .",
    "spatio - temporal chaos was studied by @xcite , who also surveyed the occurrence of lattice patterns  stripes , squares or hexagons  as a function of viscosity and frequency .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the dependence of the pattern on the depth of the layer .",
    "in addition to patterns or quasi - patterns , very localized circular waves called oscillons may occur , as seen by @xcite .",
    "the faraday instability is the first macroscopic system in which such structures have been observed .",
    "these discoveries endow the faraday instability with a very great fundamental interest for understanding the natural formation of patterns .",
    "a number of theoretical or semi - numerical analyses were inspired by these experiments .",
    "@xcite extended the linear stability analysis of @xcite to viscous fluids .",
    "this analysis was experimentally confirmed by @xcite and used by @xcite to predict cases in which the response would be harmonic rather than subharmonic .",
    "the method was extended by @xcite to calculate the stability tongues in the case of two - frequency forcing .",
    "integral equation formulations of the viscous linear stability problem were derived by @xcite and @xcite , who also studied the harmonic response case .",
    "@xcite used the lubrication approximation and the wkb method to study shallow viscous layers , obtaining a mathieu equation that was later used by @xcite to derive analytic results about the response to multifrequency forcing .    linear analysis",
    "provides no information about the shape of the patterns which appear ; other means are necessary to understand the occurence of a given pattern or the amplitude of stabilization .",
    "weakly nonlinear approximations have been derived from the navier ",
    "stokes equations by vials and co - workers , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite , focusing on the competition between different patterns .",
    "@xcite derived equations governing the interaction between faraday waves and the mean flow",
    ". there has been a great deal of analysis of lattices , superlattices and quasi - patterns using equivariant dynamical systems theory , as well as model equations designed to produce specific patterns , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the approximation of quasipatterns in spatially periodic domains has also been addressed in @xcite .",
    "investigation of the full nonlinear viscous problem , however , requires numerical simulations , of which there have been very few up to now , specifically those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . with the exception of @xcite ,",
    "all previous simulations have been two - dimensional .",
    "the most extensive simulation thus far has been that of @xcite and @xcite , who used a finite - difference method applied to a boundary - fitted time - dependent coordinate system . at each timestep ,",
    "the surface is advected and a new 2d grid , adapted to the surface , is recomputed .",
    "the amplitude of their numerically computed faraday waves confirmed the weakly nonlinear analysis of @xcite , including their prediction of a range of subcriticality .",
    "their calculations also predicted qualitatively new phenomena , such as disconnected solution branches and slow modulated dynamics .",
    "@xcite used a method similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although they reproduced some features of the experiments by @xcite , their calculations were limited to accelerations only 0.5 % above critical .",
    "the investigation by ubal  ( 2003 ) focused on the influence of liquid depth in two - dimensional simulations using a galerkin finite - element method in transformed coordinates .",
    "in addition to comparing their linear stability predictions with those of @xcite and @xcite , they calculated instantaneous surface profiles and velocity fields , as well as the temporal evolution and spectrum .",
    "valha  ( 2002 ) examined the response of a liquid layer in a vertical cylindrical vessel using the mac ( marker - and - cell ) method of @xcite .",
    "surface tension was treated by the continuum surface force model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted numerical simulations using an ale ( arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ) spectral - element code in both two and three dimensions ; a visualization of a square pattern was presented .",
    "the hexagonal patterns , quasi - patterns and oscillons which motivate our investigation are intrinsically three - dimensional , and have never been calculated numerically from the fluid - dynamical equations . here",
    "we report on the results of fully nonlinear , three - dimensional simulations of faraday waves using a finite - difference front - tracking method . in the classic faraday problem",
    "the lighter fluid is usually taken to be air whose effects can be neglected .",
    "however , in contrast to the previously cited investigations , the numerical method described here solves the navier ",
    "stokes equations for the general case of two distinct superposed fluids .",
    "the capability of the method to simulate the motion of both fluids is important in that it permits comparison of numerical results with those of certain experimental configurations , namely those of @xcite where the lighter fluid can not be ignored .",
    "these experiments were the first to provide quantitative measurements of the complete spatio - temporal fourier spectrum of faraday waves and thus form an excellent basis for quantitative comparison with our numerical results in the nonlinear finite amplitude regime , i.e. interfaces with steep slopes . in the next two sections of this article , we present the hydrodynamic equations that govern the faraday instability and then describe the computational method .",
    "the two sections following these are dedicated to the comparison of our results with the linear theory of @xcite and with the experiments of kityk  ( 2005 , 2009 ) . after comparing numerical and experimental spatio - temporal spectra for squares and hexagons , we present the three - dimensional velocity field for the hexagonal pattern .",
    "the mathematical model of the faraday experiment consists of two incompressible and immiscible viscous fluids in a three - dimensional domain @xmath0 $ ] , bounded at @xmath1 and @xmath2 by flat walls .",
    "the two fluids , each uniform and of densities @xmath3 , @xmath4 and viscosities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , initially form two superposed horizontal layers with an interface between them .",

    "stokes equations for incompressible , newtonian fluids are    [ eq2 - 3 ] @xmath17@xmath18    here @xmath19 is the pressure and @xmath20 is the capillary force ( per unit volume ) and is defined below . equations ( [ eq2 - 3b ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 3a ] ) are valid for the entire domain , including the interface , in spite of the fact that the density and viscosity change discontinuously and the surface tension acts only at the interface . in this single - fluid formulation ,",
    "the density and viscosity fields are defined in terms of the densities and viscosities of the two fluids    [ eq2 - 4 ] @xmath21    with the aid of a heaviside function , @xmath22 where we recall that @xmath23 is a point anywhere in the three - dimensional volume and @xmath7 is the vertical projection of @xmath24 onto the interface .",
    "the capillary force is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface tension coefficient , assumed to be constant , @xmath27 is the unit normal to the interface ( directed into the upper fluid ) and @xmath28 its curvature .",
    "@xmath29 is a three - dimensional dirac distribution that is nonzero only where @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the surface defined by the instantaneous position of the interface .    to complete the system of equations we need an expression for the motion of the interface .",
    "one such expression can be easily derived by noting that mass conservation in an incompressible flow requires @xmath32 , which in view of the discontinuous density field ( [ eq2 - 4a ] ) , is equivalent to @xmath33 thus the interface is represented implicitly by @xmath34 and advected by material motion of the fluid .",
    "the computational domain is a rectangular parallelepiped , horizontally periodic in @xmath35 and @xmath36 and bounded in @xmath10 by flat walls for which we impose no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "the entire domain is discretized by a uniform fixed three - dimensional finite - difference mesh .",
    "this mesh has a standard staggered mac cell arrangement @xcite where the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 velocity nodes are located on the corresponding cell faces and scalar variables are located at the cell centres .",
    "each cell is of dimension @xmath40 .    within the domain ,",
    "the two distinct immiscible fluids are separated by a two - dimensional interface which is discretized by a second mesh as sketched in figure [ figdomain ] .",
    "this moving and deformable mesh is composed of triangular elements whose motion is treated by a front - tracking / immersed - boundary method . because we have assumed that @xmath41 is single valued , the nodes of the mesh can be fixed in @xmath35 and @xmath36 and only their vertical displacements need to be calculated , which is a considerable simplification to the general front - tracking method .        after setting appropriate initial and boundary conditions , the computational solution algorithm for each timestep is composed of three main phases .",
    "first , the interface is advected and the density and viscosity fields updated according to the new interface position .",
    "the capillary force @xmath20 is then calculated .",
    "finally , the velocity and pressure are found by means of a standard projection method .",
    "each of these steps is described below .",
    "purely eulerian interface methods such as volume of fluid ( hirt & nichols 1981 ) or level set ( osher & sethian 1988 ) use a form of ( [ eq2 - 9 ] ) to advect a scalar field such as @xmath34 , or a level - set function that implicitly represents the interface .",
    "however , in the front - tracking approach that we use here , the interface markers themselves ( the nodes of the triangular mesh ) are advected .",
    "@xmath34 is then constructed from the position and geometry of the interface .",
    "taking ( [ eq2 - 9 ] ) as a starting point , we develop an equivalent expression for the vertical displacement of the triangular interface mesh .    the material derivative of ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) gives : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( for a derivation of ( [ gradh ] ) see tryggvason  2001 . ) factoring ( [ eq3 - 9 ] ) by @xmath45 @xmath46 the right - hand side of ( [ eq3 - 10 ] ) can only be zero everywhere , including on the surface , @xmath47 , if @xmath48 which establishes the material motion of the explicit interface representation @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the identity tensor . the specific choice of @xmath52 made here",
    "gives for @xmath53 @xmath54.\\ ] ] with this , ( [ eq3 - 12 ] ) leads to the specific displacement relations :    [ eq3 - 14 ] @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    the application of this advection to the triangular mesh we use for tracking the interface is straightforward . at each vertex",
    "the horizontal displacement is zero and for the vertical displacement we compute a first - order approximation to ( [ eq3 - 14c ] ) : @xmath58 the superscripts @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote , respectively , the old and new time levels .",
    "the derivatives on the right - hand side are evaluated using a simple upwind scheme which requires the usual cfl ( courant - friedrichs - lewy ) time step restriction .",
    "the vertical displacement of the interface mesh requires knowledge of the velocities at the element nodes @xmath61 .",
    "these in general do not coincide with the eulerian grid nodes @xmath62 , whose indices correspond to discretized coordinates along the respective directions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath10 . the problem of communicating eulerian grid velocities to the element nodes is overcome by interpolation between the two grids as is typically done in front - tracking and immersed - boundary methods .",
    "here we use the particular interpolation @xmath63 the kernel @xmath64 is a smoothed version of the three - dimensional dirac delta function with compact support of four grid nodes in each direction ( for details of the front - tracking method , see tryggvason  2001 , and for the immersed - boundary method , see peskin 1977 ) . in ( [ eq3-int ] ) the weighted information collected from nearby eulerian grid nodes is interpolated to a given element node .",
    "we now seek to update the density and viscosity fields needed in ( [ eq2 - 4 ] ) , which require @xmath34 .",
    "the equation for @xmath34 , based on the updated values of @xmath49 and @xmath27 , is formulated by taking the divergence of ( [ gradh ] ) :    [ eq3 - 17 ] @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67    the discretized version of the poisson problem ( [ eq3 - 17a ] ) is @xmath68 where standard central differencing is used for the gradient and divergence operators .",
    "this numerically calculated heaviside function is a smoothed transition from 0 to 1 across a distance of 4 grid cells in the direction normal to the interface .",
    "in contrast to ( [ eq3-int ] ) , the summation above serves to distribute weighted information from an element node to nearby eulerian grid nodes .",
    "since an element is triangular , its vertices lie in the same plane , its normal vector is unique and the three tangent vectors are simple to calculate : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the tangents on two distinct edges of the triangle ( see the sketch in figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "we solve ( [ eq3 - 18 ] ) by fast fourier transform .",
    "finally , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are updated using ( [ eq2 - 4a ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 4b ] ) .    ) . for the shaded triangle",
    "the forces act perpendicular to the triangle s edges ( unlabelled solid arrows ) , the dashed arrows are the corresponding forces on the edges of neighboring triangles . the net capillary force at the shared edge between any two triangles ( the sum of the solid and dashed vectors )",
    "is directed into the fluid on the concave side of the interface .",
    ", width=294 ]      from ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) , the capillary force involves the curvature of the interface and its normal vector .",
    "however , from a computational point of view , curvature is a difficult quantity to compute accurately .",
    "it is more accurate and physically appealing to calculate the force pulling on the edge of each individual triangular surface element and then sum the contributions for all the elements over the surface . for a given surface element @xmath74 of surface area @xmath75 and perimeter @xmath76 ,",
    "we can write : @xmath77 where the last integral represents the sum of the capillary forces exerted around the element perimeter .",
    "as sketched in figure [ fig0 ] , the directions of these forces are oriented along the surface and normal to the element s edges .",
    "the net force at the shared edge between any two triangles ( the sum of the solid and dashed vectors ) is directed into the fluid on the concave side of the interface . following peskin s immersed boundary method @xcite ,",
    "the discrete version of ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) becomes @xmath78 where we use the same smoothed @xmath64 as in ( [ eq3-int ] ) and ( [ eq3 - 18 ] ) .",
    "thereby , several interfacial elements contribute to the calculation of the force applied to a single eulerian node , and a single element influences more than one eulerian node .",
    "the navier ",
    "stokes equations are solved by a projection method ( chorin 1968 ; temam 1968 ) with incremental pressure correction ( goda 1979 ) applied to a finite - difference scheme which is first order in time and second order in space .",
    "in addition a semi - implicit scheme is chosen for the velocities to relax the stability restriction on the time step due to viscous diffusion .",
    "all spatial derivative operators are evaluated using standard centred differences , except in the nonlinear term where we use a second - order eno ( essentially - non - oscillatory ) scheme .",

    "the time stepping algorithm is thus @xmath79 with the boundary conditions on the top and bottom walls @xmath80 in ( [ eq3 - 3 ] ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath20 depend on @xmath24 via ( [ eq2 - 4][eq2 - 8 ] ) and have already been updated by ( [ eq3 - 16 ] ) .",
    "we decompose the solution of ( [ eq3 - 3 ] ) in three steps .",
    "the first step is a semi - implicit calculation of an intermediate unprojected velocity @xmath83 , involving only velocities and their gradients :    [ eq3 - 5 ] @xmath84 @xmath85    in the second step , we include the capillary , acceleration and old pressure gradient terms to calculate the unprojected velocity @xmath86 : @xmath87 finally we perform a projection step to find the divergence free velocity @xmath88 :    [ eq3 - 7 ] @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91    equations ( [ eq3 - 7 ] ) imply the following elliptic problem for the pressure increment    [ eq3 - 8 ] @xmath92 @xmath93    which we solve with an iterative biconjugate gradient stabilized algorithm ( saad 1996 ) . in the horizontal directions ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the velocity and pressure , thus excluding a net horizontal pressure gradient .",
    "for the simulations we will present here , this choice is consistent with the requirement of no mean horizontal flux in a large but bounded container .",
    "we note that in the implicit solution of ( [ eq3 - 5 ] ) , we apply the same biconjugate gradient stabilized solver used for the pressure to each component of @xmath94 separately .",
    "thus only the diagonal terms of the diffusion operator are treated fully implicitly .",
    "the off - diagonal terms are treated quasi - implicitly in that the newest available values of @xmath95 are used in the evaluation of the cross derivatives . to ensure symmetry , we permute the order of solution for each component .",
    "in the absence of lateral boundaries , the equations are homogeneous in the horizontal coordinates and the solutions can be represented by a spatial fourier transform : @xmath96 the linear instability of the interface between two fluids is described by ( [ eq2 - 2])([eq2 - 9 ] ) linearized about a zero velocity field and flat interface @xmath97 .",
    "the linearized equations depend only on the wavenumber @xmath98 of each wave and not on its orientation and hence the coefficient of @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 ; additionally the dynamics of each @xmath100 is decoupled from the others .",
    "linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients have solutions which are exponential or trigonometric in time . for the faraday instability @xmath100 is instead governed by a system of linear partial differential equations with time - periodic coefficients , i.e. a floquet problem , whose solutions are of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 is real and @xmath104 .",
    "the floquet modes , @xmath105 are not trigonometric , but remain periodic with fundamental frequency @xmath16 . thus , the linearized behavior for a single mode is @xmath106 analogous expressions hold for the velocity @xmath107 .    equation ( [ eq4 - 1 ] ) shows that if @xmath103 is non - zero or @xmath108 is irrational , the evolution of the interface motion is not periodic .",
    "a non - zero @xmath103 indicates that the motion grows or decays according to the sign of @xmath103 .",
    "an irrational @xmath108 yields a quasi - periodic evolution function . for the faraday instability",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath108 can only take two values : 0 and @xmath109 . as the imposed acceleration @xmath15",
    "is increased , one encounters regions in the @xmath110 plane in which @xmath111 for one dominant temporal frequency , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . within each instability tongue",
    ", the amplitude of the mode grows exponentially .",
    "these tongues are called harmonic if @xmath114 and subharmonic if @xmath115 .",
    "as @xmath116 is increased , one encounters an alternating sequence of subharmonic and harmonic tongues , which are bounded by neutral curves @xmath117 on which @xmath118 . on the neutral curves , the solutions are periodic :    [ eq4 - 2 ] @xmath119",
    "we first compare our numerically calculated instability thresholds with those found by @xcite for the same parameter values .",
    "the physical parameters are @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the lower fluid and @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the upper fluid .",

    "initially , the interface is sinusoidal with wavevector @xmath141 parallel to the @xmath35-axis and the velocity is zero .",
    "moreover , to ensure that the solution corresponds initially to the linear solution , we require the amplitude of the interface displacement to be small compared to @xmath142 . in order to maintain a roughly cubic mesh and a minimum @xmath35-resolution of about 50 grid cells per wavelength , we vary the resolution in the @xmath10 direction between 126 and 144 points . since @xmath141 points along the @xmath35 direction , @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath36 ( neither do the velocity nor the pressure ) and so the size of the domain and resolution in @xmath36 are arbitrary .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that these thresholds are in good agreement , despite whatever inaccuracies in @xmath145 are introduced by spatial discretization and linear interpolation .",
    "the relative error in the critical acceleration at the conditions previously stated is of the order of a few per cent as shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    ".comparison of the computed @xmath145 with floquet theory for various wavenumbers @xmath116 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results suggest that there is a @xmath116 below which calculation of the growth rates is not possible .",
    "some zones of the diagram are not accessible because a domain of width @xmath146 necessarily accommodates all wavenumbers which are integer multiples of @xmath116 up to the resolution limit @xmath147 .",
    "the coefficients of the fourier expansion of the initial condition differ slightly from zero due to finite - difference spatial approximations and if the growth rate of one of these is greater than that of @xmath116 itself , then it will quickly come to dominate @xmath116 .",
    "this difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that several forcing periods are required for @xmath103 to stabilize .",
    "then the amplitude , whose evolution was expected to be almost periodic , starts to rise before the precise determination of @xmath103 is possible , for example in the range of @xmath116 between 0 and roughly @xmath148 . as we see in figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the critical forcing is substantially lower for one of its multiples closer to @xmath149 . the amplitude corresponding to this wavelength , although initially negligible , increases and rapidly dominates the mode we wish to study , making the calculation of @xmath103 unfeasible .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath150 , the growth rate did not vary significantly after having reached a value near zero ( relative fluctuations of about @xmath151 of the growth rate s limit value were recorded after the stabilization ) .",

    ", we can compare the results of our fluid - dynamical simulations to the entire temporal behavior over a period .",

    "the temporal spectrum @xmath157 becomes richer as @xmath116 increases , leading to increasingly more complex modes , as can be observed by comparing figures [ fig2][fig4 ] .",
    "this strong anharmonicity of the curves is due to the increasing contribution of higher frequency trigonometric functions to the floquet modes as @xmath15 increases .",
    "the floquet mode corresponding to @xmath161 , with the smallest value of @xmath162 , should be closer to trigonometric , with a fundamental frequency of @xmath163 .",
    "in the full nonlinear evolution of the interface for @xmath164 , the amplitude of the interface height grows in time until nonlinear terms in ( [ eq2 - 2])([eq2 - 9 ] ) become important .",

    "these figures show the velocity fields on horizontal planes at three instants spanning the oscillation period of a hexagonal pattern , as well as the vertical velocity on the interface .",
    "figures [ fig : vel07 ] , [ fig : vel41 ] and [ fig : vel73 ] correspond approximately to the visualizations of figures [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] and [ fig10b ] , where the structures are more visible since the interface has been repeated periodically in the horizontal directions for clarity .",
    "the parameters are the same as those given previously , except that the acceleration @xmath15 has been decreased to @xmath240 , and the number of triangles used to represent the interface has been increased to 64 times the total number of horizontal gridpoints .",
    "figure [ fig : vel07 ] is taken at @xmath241 , just after the interface reaches its maximum height ( at @xmath242 ) , when the peaks are beginning to descend .",
    "consequently , the fluid converges horizontally towards the interface peaks , then descends dramatically below them .",

    "the fluid converges inwards horizontally above the peaks , then descends into the craters and diverges outwards horizontally just below them .",
    "figure [ fig : vel73 ] , at @xmath244 , shows that the rims of the wide flat craters seen in figure [ fig : vel41 ] have in turn collapsed inwards , forming circular waves which invade the craters , whose remnants are visible as dimples .",
    "the velocity field of figure [ fig : vel73 ] shows fluid converging horizontally below these dimples .",
    "these are erupting at velocities which are the largest in the cycle , and will eventually reconstitute the high peaks seen in figure [ fig : vel07 ] .",
    "figures [ fig : vel07][fig : vel73 ] , as well as figures [ fig9][fig10b ] , show that these cases pose great computational difficulties .",
    "the interface periodically forms a very thin film ( approximately @xmath245 ; see wide crater in figures [ fig10a ] and [ fig : vel41 ] ) over large portions of the lower boundary , within which the velocity may be significant .",
    "these features make it difficult to adequately resolve the flow in this layer . for the time being we use a uniform grid spacing ; however , in this case an adaptive grid would be more efficient and is under development .",
    "we have also simulated hexagons with resolutions of @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "although we do not show these , the two highest resolutions lead to very similar spatial spectra with a maximum difference in amplitudes of the principal modes of about 5% between the @xmath246 and @xmath228 resolutions .",
    "the case resolved by only 50 cells in the @xmath10 direction shows differences mainly in the @xmath206 mode where the difference between the @xmath247 and @xmath228 resolution is about 25% ; for the two other modes the difference is about 10% .",
    "hexagonal motifs were observed for all of the resolutions .    the calculation for the hexagon case , for the resolution of @xmath228 takes about 7 h per subharmonic oscillation on a 2.16 ghz intel processor .",
    "this corresponds to 42 h of calculation time for 1 s of physical time .",
    "in contrast to the square patterns , all of the hexagonal patterns that we have observed are transient . in our calculations",
    ", they last for several seconds , i.e. about 1520 subharmonic oscillation periods , over which time the amplitudes and periods of the principal modes remain constant .",
    "this is also the case for the experimental observations ( a. kityk & c. wagner , private communication ) , although the experimental lifetimes are longer . in our simulations , hexagonal patterns alternated with patterns with other symmetries , whose lifetimes were long ( on the order of several seconds ) but irregular .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the hexagonal state may belong to a heteroclinic orbit",
    ". a more extensive examination of the hexagonal regime will be the subject of a future investigation .",

    "stokes equations for two fluid layers of different densities and viscosities are solved using a finite - difference method .",
    "the interface motion and surface tension are treated using a front - tracking / immersed - boundary technique .",
    "the simulations are validated in several ways .",
    "first , for small oscillation amplitudes , our computations match the solution of @xcite to the floquet problem which results from the linearized evolution equations .",
    "the boundaries of the instability tongues , i.e. the critical amplitude as a function of horizontal wavenumber are calculated for several wavenumbers on several tongues and are in good agreement with the theoretical values .",
    "the temporal dependence of the floquet modes is also well reproduced by our numerical results , an even more quantitatively significant validation .    for finite oscillation amplitude ,",
    "our computations reproduce the square and hexagonal patterns observed by kityk  ( 2005 , 2009 ) at moderate and high - oscillation amplitudes , respectively .",
    "although the domains shown in figure [ fig8 ] were chosen to accommodate square and hexagonal patterns respectively , we consider the emergence of these patterns at the appropriate parameter values a non - trivial test of our program , since these domains can also accommodate rectangles and stripes .",
    "quantitative comparisons were made between experiment and simulation of the spatio - temporal spectra .",
    "our numerical results lie well within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the hexagonal patterns are long - lived transients and show intriguing dynamical behavior . our direct numerical simulations provide velocity fields and pressure throughout the entire domain of calculation .",
