    "even more , for some young neutron stars - magnetars , the magnetic field achieves values up to @xmath12 g ( @xmath13a.u . ) .",
    "it raises a general question about the behavior of matter under such extreme magnetic fields ( see for a review e.g. @xcite ) . from a practical point of view , because of the intense magnetic fields , the content of a neutron star atmosphere became an issue .",
    "what kind of chemical species are formed there ?",
    "this question got major importance after 2002 when the chandra x - ray observatory discovered in the spectra of radiation of the isolated neutron star 1e1207.4 - 5209 two absorption features at @xmath14kev and @xmath15kev .",
    "extensive theoretical studies of traditional and exotic molecular systems in the presence of a strong magnetic field have been carried on ( for a review see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that for magnetic fields @xmath16 g the most bound one - electron systems are the exotic molecular ions he@xmath0 and heh@xmath1 besides the traditional molecular ion h@xmath17 . with the hypothesis of a neutron star atmosphere composed of mixed hydrogen - helium molecules ,",
    "a model was proposed  @xcite that could explain the two absorption features discovered by the chandra x - ray observatory . even more , if the magnetic field strength is increased , new exotic finite molecular chains start to be present . in particular , for @xmath18a.u .",

    "the aim of the present work is to make an accurate study of the two molecular ions @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath22 g where the relativistic corrections seem to be unimportant .",
    "the molecular axis is assumed to be aligned parallel to the magnetic field line because this configuration is optimal if a magnetic field is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation is considered where the positively - charged centers are supposed to be infinitely massive .    following  @xcite in the case of one - electron systems the _ variational method _ and the _ lagrange - mesh method _ are two methods which complement each other .",

    "@xcite nowadays provides the most accurate results for some simple one - electron molecular systems in the presence of a strong magnetic field . in practice",
    ", the implementation of the lagrange - mesh method calculations is made easier and often feasible with _ a priori _ knowledge of the equilibrium distance and the corresponding total energy .",
