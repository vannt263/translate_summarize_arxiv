    "soft excesses are the steep upturn in the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) below @xmath12kev ( e.g. ) . they were first detected in seyfert galaxies @xcite , where they are quite common (; mushotzky et al .",
    ". they can be modelled by a steep power law ( @xmath22 ) , or by a cool thermal component ( t@xmath3ev ) , and are thought to be the high energy tail of the accretion disc radiation ( e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "soft excesses are reasonably common in quasars @xcite , and there appears to be a trend for the more distant objects to have flatter spectra @xcite , as expected if a soft component were being redshifted below the soft x - ray energy range .",
    "initial detections were in radio - quiet objects @xcite , but more recent work @xcite suggests that a soft excess may also be a common feature in radio - loud objects .",
    "one of these with a consistently detected soft excess is 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "it is also one object for which the spectral parameters of the soft excess itself are reasonably well known ( leach et al .",

    "we have presented contemporary _ rxte _ ( 215kev ) and _ rosat _ ( 0.12kev ) observations of the quasar 3c 279 at daily intervals over a three week period . during this time the source exhibited only low amplitude variability , decreasing in flux by @xmath130 per cent .",
    "the largely featureless nature of the light curves prevents us from determining any lag between the _ rxte _ and _ rosat _ light curves which are quite consistent with zero time delay .",
    "we find no evidence for any spectral variability either within the _ rxte _ observations or in the combined _ rxte _ and _ rosat _ observations .",
    "there is also no significant evidence that a soft excess is present , although modelling can not rule out a soft excess which emits 25 per cent of the 0.12.0kev x - ray luminosity .",
    "comparison with 3c 273 shows that any soft excess is relatively weaker in 3c 279 than in 3c 273 ( although the upper limit to the soft excess in 3c 279 in terms of absolute luminosity is some three times larger than that of 3c 273 ) .",
    "this relative weakness could be caused by a number of phenomena , such as a more luminous source having a more massive black hole and cooler disc , but it is more likely that 3c 279 is more jet dominated than 3c 273 , perhaps due to a higher beaming factor or more acute viewing angle .",
