    "the present paper devotes itself to the study of couplings of neutral pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to the nucleon in the ozi - rule - respecting flavor basis : @xmath8 . in the process",
    ", the surprising smallness of the @xmath3 coupling observed in various reactions finds a natural explanation .",
    "this problem has recently been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the considered framework , the @xmath9 components of the @xmath0 and @xmath7(1420 ) wave functions , couple to the nucleon partly at tree - level via a goldberger - treiman ( gt )",
    "relation that follows from the universality of the strange axial quark current , and partly via the gluon axial current . on the contrary , within the context of current universality ,",
    "tree - level @xmath10 couplings are ruled out as the weak axial current does not contain the light flavors in a symmetric combination @xcite .",
    "we here take a pragmatic position and mimic such vertices by means of triangular corrections . to be specific ,",
    "we first bridge the initial @xmath11 quarkonium to the meson cloud surrounding the nucleon and then couple the secondary mesons to universal currents . for example , the @xmath12 part of the @xmath0 wave function ( to be denoted by @xmath13 ) can be linked to the charged nucleon vector and axial vector currents by means of @xmath5 triangular vertices .",
    "indeed , the @xmath14 meson picks up the isotriplet vector current , while @xmath15 selects the isotriplet axial one . in other words",
    ", we approximate @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath18 part from the f@xmath19 state ( to be denoted by @xmath20 ) is coupled to the nucleon by means of @xmath21 triangles .",
    "in due course , the couplings of the neutral pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons to the nucleon arise as combinations of the small fraction of nucleon helicity carried by the strange quark sea , and the small triangular vertex corrections .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that @xmath22 appears suppressed relative to quark model predictions based on the octet goldberger ",
    "treiman relation .",
    "in this way , instead of interpreting the smallness of the @xmath3 coupling in terms of a suppressed nucleon octet axial matrix element@xmath23 mass splitting was revealed and the necessity for higher - order corrections discussed . ] , we here rather reformulate this problem in terms of an enhancement of axial @xmath24 couplings due to vertex corrections .    a method similar in spirit to the one presented here but of different techniques is the so  called meson cloud model of ref .",
    "@xcite . there , the authors study the influence of the mesons surrounding the nucleon on its electromagnetic and weak vector form factors in terms of a nucleon wave function having a non  negligible overlap with the nucleon - meson scattering continuum .",
    "we here focus rather on the isoscalar axial form factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly outline the calculation scheme of @xmath25 and f@xmath19(1420)@xmath26 vertices in the flavor - basis . in sect .",
    "3 the effective @xmath25 vertex is calculated from the @xmath27 triangular vertex , while sect .  4 contains the results on the effective f@xmath19(1420 ) meson nucleon - couplings associated with the @xmath28 triangle .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "the @xmath0 wave function in the @xmath30 flavor basis is parametrized as @xcite : @xmath31 in the following we assume the pseudoscalar @xmath32 coupling @xmath33 to be patterned after the states flavor mixing @xmath34 in order to obtain @xmath35 , the pseudoscalar coupling of the @xmath36 strange quarkonium to the nucleon , one may exploit sakurai s idea on current universality and field - current identity to relate the tree - level part of @xmath35 to the weak decay constant @xmath37 via a goldberger - treiman type relation @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are in turn the nucleon mass and the strange axial coupling .",
    "the gt - relation in eq .",

    "the net @xmath3 coupling contains in addition a term , here denoted by @xmath42 , and which is associated with the pseudoscalar @xmath43 coupling , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the nucleon dirac spinor , @xmath46 is the gluon field , @xmath47 is its dual , @xmath48 denotes the strange quarkonium field .",
    "the @xmath49 mass @xmath50 and the pion weak decay constant @xmath51 serve as scale parameters .",
    "in other words , @xmath22 decomposes into @xmath52 a rough estimate for @xmath42 can be obtained from shore ",
    "venziano s expression @xcite for @xmath53 , the pseudoscalar @xmath54 coupling , @xmath55 here , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 standing for the @xmath58 coupling . with the numerical values for @xmath59 1 , and @xmath60 deduced from @xcite after accounting for the additional factor of @xmath61 in their current normalizations",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 . in noticing that",
    "@xmath63 and assuming @xmath64 to be flavor independent , we estimate @xmath65 .    on the other hands , the strange axial coupling @xmath40 that enters the strange gt relation equals @xmath66 , the genuine quark part of @xmath67 , the fraction of nucleon polarization carried by the strange quark - gluon sea . in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath67 is given by @xmath68    in using the values of @xmath67(10 gev@xmath690.02 , @xmath70(10  gev@xmath71)=0.25 , and  @xmath72(10  gev@xmath71)=2@xmath731.3 from ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds @xmath74 . we will consider this value as compatible with zero . in the following ,",
    "@xmath75 will be neglected , so that @xmath76 this is the quantity that we will keep in eq .",
    "( [ getan_ozi ] )    in general , pseudoscalar meson - nucleon couplings , @xmath77 , are related to gradient couplings , @xmath78 , via the well known equality @xcite @xmath79 with @xmath80 standing for the meson mass . that the gt - relation from eq .",
    "( [ etas_gt ] ) entirely originates from ( strange ) axial current universality is expressed by means of the following current - current couplings : @xmath81 here , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the respective @xmath41 parts of the f@xmath19 and @xmath0 fields , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the associated axial currents .",
    "the combination @xmath86 is identified with the f@xmath87(1420)@xmath88 contact coupling @xmath89 , while @xmath90 is associated with the gradient @xmath91 coupling , i.e. one defines @xmath92 indeed , eq .",

    "as long as at tree level the contact @xmath3 coupling appears proportional to @xmath66 rather than follows the octet gt - relation @xmath93 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 meson can be interpreted as a `` partial '' strange goldstone boson , a result already conjectured in a previous work @xcite .",
    "note , that the accuracy of gt  relations has been reliably proven only for the case of the pion ",
    "nucleon system @xcite . the subtle reason for this situation can be understood if we note that mesons transporting weak interaction are not same as such participating strong interaction .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electroweak gauge group su(2)@xmath94u(1 ) and the strong flavor group su(3)@xmath95 do not share , in general , common multiplets . because of that , the weak interaction is incapable to recognize the @xmath0 meson as a particle different but a strange quarkonium .",
    "the mismatch between the flavor contents of strong and electroweak spin-0 mesons has been studied extensively , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of f - spin breaking through the electroweak gauge symmetry . using the genuine electroweak meson states from @xcite in the construction of weak nucleon - nucleon potentials is an interesting goal for future research as it might modify interpretation of parity violation effects in nuclei .",
    "now , due to the smallness of @xmath66 , the @xmath96 and f@xmath19(1420 ) mesons practically decouple at tree level from the nucleon",
    ". this might be one of the main reasons for which a strong suppression of the @xmath3 couplings has frequently been found over the years by various data analyses of @xmath0 photo - production off proton at threshold @xcite , as well as nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) and nucleon  hyperon ( ny ) phase shifts @xcite .",
    "same observation applies to @xmath97 . in the following",
    ", the strange tree level couplings will be of minor importance and neglected .",
    "compared to @xmath98 , the calculation of the pseudoscalar @xmath99 coupling can not be discussed in terms of universality of the non - strange isosinglet axial current , as the weak axial current does not contain the light flavors in a symmetric combination .",
    "therefore , no obvious gt - relation can be written for @xmath100 ( see fig .  2 ) .    in the following two sections we consider the @xmath101 and @xmath102 vertices to proceed entirely via small but non  negligible triangular loops of the type @xmath103 in fig .  4 , and @xmath104 in fig .  7 , respectively .",
    "in this section we calculate the gradient and pseudoscalar coupling constants of the @xmath0 meson to the nucleon by means of triangular vertices involving the @xmath14(980 ) and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "the special role of the @xmath105 triangular diagram as the dominant one  loop mechanism for the @xmath3 coupling is emphasized by the circumstance that the @xmath106 meson is the lightest meson with a two particle decay channel containing the @xmath0 particle @xcite .",
    "the contributions of heavier mesons such as the isotriplet @xmath107 tensor meson with an @xmath108 decay channel and the isoscalar @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 tensor mesons with @xmath112 decay channels will be left out of consideration because of the short range character of the corresponding triangle diagrams on the one side , triangular vertex . ] and because of the comparatively small couplings of the tensor mesons to the nucleon @xcite on the other side .",
    "the @xmath113 triangular couplings in ( fig .",
    "3 ) have been calculated using the following effective lagrangians : @xmath114    here @xmath115 and @xmath116 in turn denote the pseudovector @xmath117 and the scalar @xmath118 coupling constants .",
    "we adopt for @xmath115 the standard value @xmath119 and fit @xmath120 to data .",
    "the value of @xmath121 has been extracted from the experimental decay width @xcite when ascribing the total @xmath14 width to the @xmath122 decay channel .",
    "note that @xmath123 represents only a part of the full chiral lagrangians of the @xmath124 system constructed in ref .",
    "the term containing the gradient @xmath125 coupling has not been taken into account so far as we restrict ourself to lagrangians containing a minimal number of derivatives to ensure convergence of the expressions .",
    "nonetheless , through the use of a gradient @xmath117 coupling , the triangular @xmath25 vertex vanishes in the chiral limit despite the fact that the @xmath126 vertex does not . in the following",
    "we will identify the nucleon born term @xmath127 entering the diagram in fig .",
    "4 with the full amplitude @xmath128 , and parameterize it in terms of the following complete set of invariants @xmath129 where the invariant functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 in turn correspond to pseudovector ( pv ) and pseudoscalar ( ps ) types of the @xmath132 coupling .",
    "expressions for @xmath133 and @xmath131 can be found in evaluating the diagrams in fig .  4 in accordance with the standard feynman rules .",
    "we here systematically consider the incoming proton to be on its mass shell and make use of the dirac equation , so that @xmath134 holds . on the contrary ,",
    "the outgoing proton has been considered to be off its mass shell with @xmath135 the final result on @xmath133 obtained in this way reads : @xmath136 the corresponding expression for @xmath131 reads @xmath137 the function @xmath138 appearing in the last two expressions is defined as @xmath139",
    "the remarkable feature of the analytical expressions for the pseudoscalar and pseudovector @xmath3 couplings is that they are given by _",
    "completely convergent _ integrals and depend only on the @xmath140 decay constant and the respective pion and @xmath14 meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the sources of uncertainty in the parameterization of the effective @xmath141 vertex by means of the triangular @xmath105 diagram are associated with the @xmath142 coupling constant and the @xmath143 branching ratio .",
    "for example , the coupling constant @xmath116 varies between @xmath144 and @xmath145 depending on the @xmath26 potential model version @xcite . because of that we give below the values for the gradient and pseudoscalar @xmath3 couplings following from the @xmath5 triangular @xmath3 vertex as a function of the @xmath118 coupling constant : @xmath146 there are the quantities in eqs .",

    "this result was concluded from the small @xmath153 wave contribution to the almost flat angular distributions for a wide range of beam energies .",
    "note , that a larger value for @xmath22 has been extracted from total @xmath154 cross sections in using dispersion relation techniques @xcite .",
    "however , the latter procedure is endowed with more ambiguities than the straightforward calculation of the angular distributions from feynman diagrams presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ etan_ampl ] ) one sees that the triangular @xmath5 correction to the @xmath141 vertex represents a mixture @xcite of pseudovector ( pv ) and pseudoscalar ( ps ) types of @xmath3 couplings .",
    "this mixing is quite important for reproducing the form of the differential cross section for @xmath0 photo - production off proton at threshold in fig .",
    "note that such a mixing can not take place for goldstone bosons because their point - like gradient couplings to quarks are determined in a unique way . on the contrary , in case of extended effective meson - nucleon vertices , such a mixing can take place by means of eq .",
    "( [ etan_ampl ] ) .",
    "however , the pv - ps separation is model dependent and can not be interpreted as observable .",
    "data compatibility with the pv - ps mixing created by the @xmath155 triangular correction to the @xmath25 vertex is a further hint on the non  octet goldstone boson nature of the @xmath0 meson.[multiblock footnote omitted ] finally , in estimating the @xmath156 nucleon coupling in terms of eqs .",

    "thus in simulating the anomalous @xmath162 coupling by the triangular @xmath5 vertex we are able to explain the smallness of both the @xmath54 and @xmath3 couplings .",
    "the internal structure of the axial vector meson f@xmath19(1420 ) is still subject to some debates ( see note on f@xmath19(1420 ) in @xcite ) . within the constituent quark model this meson",
    "is considered as the candidate for the axial meson ( @xmath41 ) state and therefore as the parity partner to @xmath163 from the vector meson nonet .",
    "the basic difference between the neutral @xmath164 and @xmath165 vector mesons is that while the physical @xmath166 and @xmath163 mesons are almost perfect non - strange and strange quarkonia , respectively , their corresponding parity partners f@xmath19(1285 ) and f@xmath19(1420 ) are not . for these axial vector mesons strange and non  strange quarkonia appear mixed up by the angle @xmath167 ( compare ref .",

    "there , one finds that the coupling @xmath172 to the nucleon of an effective f@xmath19 meson having same mass as the f@xmath19(1285 ) meson is comparable to the @xmath173 coupling .",
    "below we demonstrate that couplings of that magnitude can be associated to a large amount with triangular diagrams of the type @xmath174 with @xmath175 .    to calculate the @xmath174 triangular coupling in ( fig .",

    "<S> the non  strange parts of the @xmath3 and f@xmath4 couplings are modeled by means of triangular @xmath5 , and @xmath6 vertices , while the strange ones partly proceed via goldberger - treiman relations , which have been concluded solely on the grounds of current universality . </S>",
