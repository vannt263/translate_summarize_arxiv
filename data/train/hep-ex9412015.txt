    "several monte carlo programs were written based on this scheme ( jetset63@xcite , for example ) and were used in various experiments to study qcd . however , since the coherence effect is the consequence of higher order corrections , the effect could only be inserted by hand in the lla scheme in these monte carlo programs .    on the other hand , even in low @xmath17 region , the momentum spectrum of gluons in the parton shower process",
    "can be analytically calculated using the modified leading log approximation(mlla)@xcite .",
    "the coherence effect is taken into account in mlla by consistently importing a part of next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "the distribution of the particle spectra is expressed as a function of two parameters , @xmath18=log(@xmath19 ) and @xmath20=log(@xmath21 ) :      here @xmath23 is the momentum of a particle normalized by the beam energy @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the opening angle of the jet cone , and @xmath26=@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29=@xmath30 and @xmath31 for five quark flavors , respectively .",
    "the two functions , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are two solutions of the confluent hyper - geometric equation .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the qcd scale parameter and the energy cut - off of the parton evolution , respectively .",
    "this calculation predicts depletion of soft partons as a consequence of the destructive interference of soft gluons .",
    "this depletion shows up clearly in eq .",
    "[ eq : mlla ] when written as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "this function has a maximum at a certain @xmath37 value and decreases in the larger @xmath37 region .",
    "the coherence effect reduces the available phase space in this region and therefore the effect can be studied by comparing the measured inclusive cross section with this calculation .",
    "however , since this expression is calculated for partons , it can not be compared directly with the measurement unless the distribution at the level of final state hadrons is ensured to be similar to that of partons .",
    "the concept of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) dictates that the distribution of the final state hadrons is closely related to that of partons@xcite .",
    "the conversion of partons into hadrons , which occurs at low virtuality scale , includes only small momentum transfer , and hence leaves the distribution essentially unchanged . in this article",
    "we compare the calculated parton spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mlla ] ) directly with the measured hadron spectrum assuming lphd .",
    "the @xmath35 , which was primarily introduced to regularize collinear singularity , gives a cut - off on parton energies .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath35 should be close to the mass of the particle being considered@xcite , while @xmath34 should be common to all the particle species .",
    "these dependences can be experimentally tested by measuring the values of @xmath35 and @xmath34 for various particle species .    the momentum spectrum might still be distorted by fragmentations and decays in spite of lphd .",
    "this complication can be avoided partially when the energy evolution of the distribution is considered .",
    "the peak position of the distribution ( eq .  [ eq : mlla ] ) is given using the limiting spectra calculation in which @xmath34 is assumed to be equal to @xmath35@xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of colors ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this should be compared with the variation as @xmath41 expected from phase space consideration alone .",
    "the data used in this analysis are accumulated by the topaz detector at the tristan @xmath4 collider at center - of - mass energies between 52.0 and 61.4  gev .",
    "the average energy is 58.0  gev , and the total integrated luminosity is 113.7/pb .",
    "details of the topaz detector is described elsewhere@xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the data from a time projection chamber ( tpc ) is mainly used for tracking and de / dx measurement for charged particles@xcite . the trigger condition relevant to",
    "this analysis is the track trigger which requires two or more charged tracks in the fiducial volume of the tpc , and the energy trigger which requires 4  gev or more energy deposit in the barrel lead glass calorimeter .",
    "the event trigger is generated by a logical or of those two , and the trigger efficiency for multihadronic events is practically 100% .    out of the triggered events ,",
    "multihadronic events are selected by the following conditions ; ( a ) five or more charged tracks having transverse momenta with respect to the beam axis larger than 0.15  gev/@xmath42 are originating from the interaction point with the angle larger than 37@xmath43 with respect to the beam axis , ( b ) total visible energy is larger than 1/2 of the center - of - mass energy , and ( c ) momentum imbalance along the beam direction is smaller than 0.4 . by these conditions , the event selection efficiency is estimated to be 67.1% with a background contamination of less than 2.0% .",
    "two - photon processes and @xmath44 productions are the main sources of the background .",
    "in addition to these cuts , the jet axis is required to have an angle larger than 40@xmath43 with respect to the beam axis to ensure that the event is well contained in the detector acceptance .",
    "applying these criteria , 11247 events remain to be used in the analysis .",
    "the particle species @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are identified by measuring the de / dx of tracks detected in tpc .",
    "the detail of the particle identification technique is described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the typical resolution of the de / dx measurement for minimum ionizing pions is 4.6% . fig .",
    "[ fig : dedx ] shows de / dx distribution as a function of the track momentum for a part of the event sample .",
    "the cross section is calculated from the number of tracks in each momentum slice . in the low momentum region ,",
    "the number of tracks for each particle species are directly obtained by counting the number of tracks in each de / dx band . the de",
    "/ dx bands are , however , not well separated in the higher momentum region . to extract the number of each particle species in this region ,",
    "the de / dx distribution in a momentum slice is fitted with a superposition of four gaussians corresponding to @xmath45 , @xmath46 s , @xmath47 s and @xmath3 in each momentum slice .",
    "the widths and the centers of the gaussians are determined from the measurement for bhabha events and cosmic ray @xmath48 s . only the normalizations of the gaussians are the free parameters of the fit .",
    "a typical fit to the de / dx distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxfit ] .",
    "because of a hardware calibration problem of the tpc , the de / dx resolution is time dependent .",
    "therefore the data sample is divided into two groups and the procedure to count the number of tracks of each particle species is done separately for these two groups .",
    "@xmath49 s are identified by searching for their daughter charged pion pairs in tpc .",
    "a pair of tracks must satisfy following conditions to be identified as a @xmath49 : a ) the distance of the closest approach of the two tracks is less than 0.8 cm ; b ) the distance from the interaction point to the decay vertex is longer than 2.0 cm where the decay vertex is defined as the center of the closest approach of two tracks ; c ) the angle formed by the vector from the interaction point to the decay vertex and the momentum sum of the two tracks at the decay vertex is less than 8 degrees if the position of decay vertex is longer than 6.0 cm ; or c ) the closest distance from the vector sum to the interaction point is less than 0.6 cm if the decay length is shorter than 6.0 cm ; d ) the closest approach of one of the tracks to the interaction point is more than 0.5 cm if the momentum sum of the tracks is less than 2gev / c ; e ) tracks are identified as @xmath46 by the de / dx measurement in the tpc ; and f ) the tracks are not from the gamma conversion .    for",
    "each of track pairs remained after these selections , the invariant mass is calculated assuming the tracks are charged pions .",
    "[ fig : ks - mass ] shows the mass distribution for the reconstructed @xmath49 s .",
    "the distribution is fitted by a sum of a gaussian and a background function ( exponential + polynomial ) and the number of reconstructed @xmath49 s is obtained to be 771 @xmath50 61 . in the same way , the numbers of these @xmath49 s are counted for each momentum slice .    the inclusive cross section , @xmath51 is then calculated from the number of particles observed in each momentum slice using following formula : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ith slice of the momentum fraction , @xmath54 is the total hadronic cross section , @xmath55 is the width of the slice , @xmath56 is the number of hadronic events in the event sample , and @xmath57 is the number of particles counted in the slice , respectively .",
    "@xmath58 is the factor to correct the counted number for the effects of detector acceptance and initial state radiation .",
    "@xmath58 is calculated for each momentum slice separately with the monte carlo simulation as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the generated number of particles in the slice @xmath53 without including the effects of the detector acceptance and the initial state radiation .",
    "@xmath61 is the corresponding total number of generated events .",
    "@xmath62 is the number of detected particles in the slice @xmath53 generated with the effects of detector acceptance and initial state radiation , and @xmath63 is the corresponding total number of generated events .",
    "the jetset6.3@xcite and 7.3@xcite monte carlo programs are used to obtain these numbers combined with the topaz detector simulation program . as for @xmath49 , to convert the counted number to the cross section of @xmath2 , @xmath58 is multiplied by 2 .",
    "the cross sections are measured as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "the measured cross section for all charged particles is shown in table  [ table : xsec0 ] .",
    "table  [ table : xsec1 ] shows the cross sections measured for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , while that for @xmath2 is shown in table  [ table : xsec2 ] .       from eq .",
    "[ eq : peak ] , the mlla prediction of peak position can be approximated in the linear form @xmath64 where @xmath65 to be 0.5 .",
    "if the gluon coherence effect is not taken into account ( phase space only ) , @xmath65 should become 1.0 . to obtain the value of @xmath65 from the measured peak positions , a linear fit is performed to the peak positions as a function of @xmath5 for all charged particles measured by tasso@xcite , topaz , and aleph as shown in fig .",
    "[ energy_evolution ] . from the fit",
    ", the value of @xmath65 is obtained to be @xmath66 .",
    "a similar fit is also done to the peak positions for charged pions ( tasso , pep4/tpc , topaz and aleph ) and @xmath65 is measured to be @xmath67 .",
    "these values are consistent with the mlla predictions .",
    "the inclusive cross sections are measured as a function of @xmath68 for all charged particles and for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 in the hadronic events taken at @xmath5=58gev .",
    "the cross sections were compared with the mlla calculation assuming lphd .",
    "the mlla formula describes the observed distributions very well for all particle species over the wide momentum range .    by this comparison ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath34 in the mlla expression are determined for each particle species .",
    "the determined @xmath35 for each of the particle species is close to the mass of the particle , while the @xmath34 is almost constant for these particles .",
    "the @xmath35 values are also determined with @xmath34 fixed at 200mev .",
    "the obtained @xmath35 also coincides with the mass of each particle . the same analysis is carried out for the measurements at @xmath69 by pep4/tpc and similar tendency is observed .",
    "these results show that the momentum distribution of particles is identical to that of partons at the end - point of the parton shower evolution independently of the energy scale .",
    "this supports the mlla + lphd conjecture .",
    "the energy evolution of the peak position in @xmath70 is studied by comparing our data with the measurements by pep4/tpc and aleph .",
    "the measured peak positions of light particles are well reproduced by the limiting spectra calculation .",
    "the measured peak positions are fitted to a linear function of log of the beam energy with the measurements at other energies .",
    "the obtained slope of the linear function is consistent with the mlla prediction , while it excludes models without the gluon coherence effect .",
