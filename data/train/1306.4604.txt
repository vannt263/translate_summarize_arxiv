    "the properties of stars , galaxies and quasars in the local and early universe can be investigated through their impact on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in particular ,",
    "the radiation emitted and the metals ejected from these objects re - ionized and polluted the igm . as a consequence ,",
    "the detailed understanding of these mechanisms has the potential to significantly constrain models for the formation and evolution of galaxies and quasars , and the re - ionization history of the universe .",
    "the igm is mainly studied through the absorption signature it leaves in the spectra of bright high - redshift sources , quasars and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the highest redshift quasars have been detected mainly by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to @xmath21 billion years after the big bang .",
    "this sample of @xmath22 objects has been used to investigate several topics , in particular the ionization and chemical status of the igm at these high redshifts ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the same high-@xmath23 quasars can be used to put an indirect constraint on the epoch of re - ionization by investigating the redshift evolution of metal abundances traced by ionic absorption lines .",
    "the investigation of the regime beyond @xmath3 is essential since in this redshift range the comoving star formation rate density appears to decline with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if a similar behaviour is observed for the mass density of metals in the igm , then a scenario where winds from in situ star - forming galaxies pollute the igm with metals would be favoured . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass density of metals is observed to remain constant , this would point to an epoch of very early enrichment of the igm , presumably by massive stars ( e.g. popiii stars ) in mini - haloes ( m  @xmath24 m@xmath25 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when shallow potential wells allow winds to distribute metals over large comoving volumes , thus producing a quite uniform metallicity distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these same massive stars could have been the main sources of ionizing photons allowing for an earlier reionization epoch .",
    "recent estimates of the evolution with redshift of the  cosmic mass density ( see definition in section 5.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show a decrease of the  content from redshift @xmath26 to 3 , and then a flat behaviour in the range @xmath27 and a possible downturn at @xmath28 .",
    "searching for intergalactic  absorption lines at @xmath28 becomes challenging because the  doublet moves into the near - infrared spectral region , absorption line spectroscopy is much more difficult in this regime because of increased detector noise , oh emission from the sky and more severe telluric absorption .",
    "the first results at @xmath29 were based on low / intermediate resolution qso spectra and a few detections of  absorptions indicating a possible decrease of the value of @xmath7 @xcite and a significant decline of the  column density distribution function ( cddf ; * ? ? ? * ) . in a recent work , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter simcoe11 ) claim the presence of a downturn in the  abundance at @xmath30 by a factor of 4.1 relative to its value at @xmath31 .",
    "the result is based on the spectra ( at resolution @xmath32 ) of seven quasars obtained with the new spectrograph fire @xcite at the magellan telescope , coupled with six observations of northern objects taken from the literature , of which four ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have three times lower resolution and lower signal - to - noise ratio than the fire sample .",
    "the northern sample shows only one  absorption system , while almost doubling the surveyed redshift path , the effect is a decrease of the value of @xmath7 , which however could be due to the lower quality of those spectra .    in this work ,",
    "we present the spectra obtained in a guaranteed time observation ( gto ) programme ( pi : v. dodorico ) carried out with the x - shooter spectrograph at the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) between 2010 january and 2011 june .",
    "the scientific aim of this project was to observe the brightest ( j@xmath33 ) quasars known with @xmath34 and observable from paranal to derive constraints both on the abundance of neutral hydrogen and on the abundance of metals at high redshift . here",
    "the results on the metal lines are reported , the  abundance will be the topic of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite , with its high sensitivity , extended spectral coverage ( from 3000   to 2.5 @xmath35 m ) and intermediate resolution , appeared to be the ideal instrument to allow significant steps forward in this research field .",
    "seven objects satisfy the chosen selection criteria .",
    "however , only four of them were observed due to bad weather downtime .",
    "luckily , two of the objects we could not observe are present in the eso x - shooter archive and we have retrieved and analysed their spectra .",
    "preliminary results on a sample of three objects ( j1306 + 0356 , j0818 + 1722 , j1509 - 1749 ) were reported in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . here , we describe the whole sample and carry out a more detailed analysis .    [ tab_obs ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes .",
