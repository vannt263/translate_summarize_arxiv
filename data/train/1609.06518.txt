    "<S> the pseudospectral versions of the discrete borg - type theorems are obtained in this article using some simple linear algebraic techniques . in particular , we prove that the periodic potential of a discrete schr@xmath0dinger operator is almost a constant if and only if the pseudospectrum of the operator is connected . </S>",
    "<S> this result is further extended to more general settings and the connection to the well - known ten martini problem is also established . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical illustrations done at the end will justify the results developed . </S>"
