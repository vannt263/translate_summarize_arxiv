    "automatic recognition of both printed and handwritten characters remains a challenging problem in pattern recognition .",
    "most existing optical character recognition software ( ocr ) deal with it by exploiting simultaneously two highly correlated techniques : character segmentation and pattern recognition . as part of the ocr process",
    ", character segmentation techniques are applied to patterns representing individual characters to be recognized . the simplest way to perform character segmentation",
    "would be to exploit the space between characters .",
    "this strategy unfortunately fails when considering mathematical formulae , handwritten and printed words with touching characters , representing well known issues that often occur in degraded ( e.g. , photocopies ) or compressed text images @xcite . in these situations , two or more adjacent characters touch together and share common pixels . to identify the touching regions and provide",
    "a correct segmentation is crucial to recognition , since incorrectly segmented characters are unlikely to be correctly recognized even from high - performance pattern recognition algorithms @xcite . in facts , many researchers state that errors in characters segmentation affect overall pattern recognition performance more than a degradation in the starting image @xcite .",
    "segmentation of touching components is crucial to get higher recognition rates by ocr systems @xcite .",
    "common techniques for character segmentation exploit several aspects characterizing letters and their shapes , such as vertical projection , pitch estimation or character size , contour analysis , or segmentation  recognition coupled techniques @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the most difficult problem an image segmentation algorithm has to address is the segmentation of touching characters @xcite , @xcite . very often , adjacent characters are touching , and may overlap , making hard the task of segmenting a given expression or word correctly into its character components @xcite .",
    "given the relevance of such challenging task , several methods have been developed in last years for performing optimal segmentation of touching characters .",
    "kurniawan et al .",
    "@xcite identify touching positions in latin handwritten characters by means of self organizing feature maps and a region  based approach . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors also deal with segmentation of latin handwritten texts .",
    "different approaches involving thinning algorithms can be found in @xcite and @xcite . among the earlier pieces of work on touching character segmentation , some approaches rely on contour analysis of the connected components for segmentation @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "sharma et al . study the problem of detecting arbitrarily  oriented text from video frames .",
    "cut positions in touching characters are evaluated using the top distance profile .",

    "rehman et al .",
    "@xcite identify character boundaries by using a set of heuristic rules .",
    "louloudis et al .",
    "@xcite performed text line and word segmentation of handwritten documents by applying the hough transform . in @xcite",
    ", the authors addressed the problem of automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents .",
    "the water reservoir algorithm has been exploited in some researches , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors presented methods derived by combining different segmentation techniques .",
    "further methods can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that works @xcite and @xcite also deal with segmenting characters and symbols within mathematical expressions .",
    "generally , these strategies need a preprocessing step where the input rgb image is converted to grayscale by eliminating the hue and saturation values while retaining the illumination , then converting the grayscale image to binary , obtaining a matrix whose entries are 0 for foreground pixels ( black ) and 1 for background pixels ( white ) for all other pixels .",
    "since different thresholds are used for detection it is possible that some feature of characters is lost in the process . in our experiments we resort on the otsu thresholding method @xcite , which has proven to be very robust to noise and to changes in scenes and input images , providing thresholds for image binarization ensuring that information loss is minimized .",
    "a function is used to evaluate each column of the matrix leveraging on features that characterize typical character positions within the text , giving a value to each column . finally , cut positions ( i.e. , columns ) are chosen depending on these values .",
    "common functions implied are the ratio of the second difference of the vertical projection ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the peak  to  valley ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other functions are , e.g. , based on number of black pixels , number of white pixels counted from the top of the column to the first black pixel , crossing count ( i.e. , number of black to white transitions ) , number of identical black ( white ) pixels with left ( right ) column , width to height ratio for the remaining left ( right ) pattern after cutting ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another approach can be found in @xcite , where the authors used the inverse crossing count , measure of blob thickness and degree of  middleness  for defining a function that identifies when a column , a row , or a diagonal is a cutting position .",
    "however , we argue that all the methods and approaches above mentioned do not provide a comprehensive answer to the problem of segmenting touching characters . indeed , their performances are not always optimal , radically depending on the specific set of characters involved in the segmentation . at the moment , there does not exist a standard approach for the segmentation of touching characters .",
    "thus , this is currently an active research field .",
    "there has always been a dilemma whether it is more convenient to segment first and then recognize the patterns , or instead classify while segmenting .",
    "authors in @xcite review casey and lecolinet work @xcite stating that that the strategies for segmentation can be classified into three main strategies as follows :    1 .",
    "the classical approach already described ; 2 .",
    "recognition - based segmentation , in which a search is made for image components that match with the character classes in a valid alphabet ; 3 .",
    "holistic approach that attempts to recognize the word as a whole .    in this classification ,",
    "our work lies near to the first class , still presenting some important advances : in fact , we aim at combining some of the previously cited features , usually exploited one at a time , by means of an original fuzzy logic approach in order to improve performances in separating touching characters .",
    "indeed , the selection of the features that characterize touching positions is an art rather than a technique . in other words ,",
    "the selection of the features mainly depends on the experience of the authors .",
    "thus , in this context , fuzzy logic can be very useful , since it is congenial to capture and to code expert  based knowledge in view of performing targeted simulations .",
    "taking this into strong consideration , we also leverage on optimization techniques to increase overall performances of our approach .",
    "fuzzy logic has been already exploited to perform image segmentation .",
    "for instance , garain and chaudhuri @xcite used fuzzy multifactorial analysis to combine some of the features previously described . in @xcite , a survey on image segmentation techniques using fuzzy clustering",
    "is presented .",
    "fuzzy logic has been also exploited for developing segmentation  recognition coupled techniques @xcite .",
    "a non  linear fuzzy approach can be found in @xcite . in @xcite , authors used edge corners and fuzzy logic to develop segmentation techniques exploited to break down captcha .",
    "further approaches can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a novel fuzzy approach that differs from the state of the art in several aspects .",
    "firstly , we combine by means of a fuzzy strategy some features that have never been exploited together in previous works . secondly , we develop an original strategy based on an inference system composed by 3input/1output with fuzzy rules specifically optimized for the purpose of separating touching characters in the case of latin printed and handwritten characters .",
    "the strength of our fuzzy strategy relies on the possibility to adjust its parameters in such a way that they can fit the characteristics of the data set . in other words , the parameters of the method",
    "are extracted a priori considering the different characters in the data set .",
    "the inference engine is based on the mamdani model with if  then rules , minimax set  operations ,",
    "sum for composition of activated rules and defuzzification based on the centroid method .",
    "we have chosen the mamdani model since it is congenial to capture and to code expert  based knowledge @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fuzzy ] , we present the fuzzy strategy conveniently developed for performing segmentation of touching characters . in section [ sec : test ] , we present the numerical results that show the effectiveness of the proposed method .",
    "specifically , in section [ sec : dataset ] , we describe the datasets used for simulations . sections [ sec : test - print ] and [ sec : test - hand ] are devoted to test the method on datasets of latin printed and handwritten characters , respectively . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conc ] we draw some conclusion and present future works .",
    "in the following , we only focus on binarized images , for homogeneity with the solutions already presented . in a binarized image , a pattern can be represented by a matrix whose entries are 0 ( black pixels ) and 1 ( withe pixels ) .",
    "generally , methods for segmenting touching characters define a function based on some features that characterize cut positions .",
    "then , such a function is evaluated for each column of the matrix and the cut position is chosen depending on these values .",
    "classical functions of this kind are the peak  to  valley function @xmath0 and the function @xmath1 defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the vertical projection function for the @xmath4-th column , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the peak positions on the left side and right side of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the column with the highest value of @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) is identified as the cutting column . a further feature , that can suggests if the @xmath4th column can be a cut position , is the distance @xmath7 between @xmath4 and the center of the pattern .",
    "indeed , generally , cutting columns are located near to the center of the pattern .",
    "clearly , this feature should be only considered as an indication of the neighborhood where the cutting column is probably located .",
    "indeed , we will exploit such a feature in combination with the previous functions with the aim of use it in order to correct the results provided by the other functions . in this section , we combine functions @xmath8 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 by means of a fuzzy strategy that conveniently balances these functions .",
    "let us introduce the notion of a  fuzzy degree \" qualifying a column @xmath4 to be a cut position : in short , @xmath9 $ ] . in our model ,",
    "the lower the value of @xmath10 , the more probable is that we have located a good cutting position .",
    "the strategy can be detailed by means of the fuzzification of the functions @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .    given a pattern in a binarized image ,",
    "let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 be the matrix of pixels of the binarized image , the number of row of @xmath11 , the number of column of @xmath11 , and the central column of @xmath11 , respectively . in the following ,",
    "when we refer to a column @xmath4 of @xmath11 , we refer to the @xmath4th column of @xmath11 , i.e. , we are considering the vector of length @xmath12 whose elements are the entries of the @xmath4th column or we are only considering its position .",
    "this will be clear from the context .",
    "the central column @xmath14 is evaluated by means of @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath13 is odd , @xmath14 is clearly the central column of @xmath11 ; when @xmath13 is even , we consider as the central column the mean between @xmath16th column and @xmath17 , even if in this case @xmath14 is not an integer number . in this way , for each column @xmath4 of @xmath11 , we define its distance from the center of the pattern as @xmath18 . in our fuzzy strategy , we take into account the normalized distance between each column @xmath4 and the central column @xmath14 , i.e. , we consider @xmath19 .    similarly , for each column @xmath4 of @xmath11 , instead of directly using the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we consider the normalized functions @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the set of the columns of @xmath11 .",
    "note that functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are well  defined since we consider matrices @xmath11 where at least two columns are different .",
    "finally , in the following we will use the functions @xmath24 so that low values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 identify cutting columns .",
    "functions @xmath27 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are fuzzified by defining convenient fuzzy sets and related membership functions",
    ". the fuzzy degree @xmath10 will be evaluated combining these functions by means of some fuzzy rules .",
    "fuzzy sets , membership functions , fuzzy rules will be specified in sections [ sec : test - print ] and [ sec : test - hand ]",
    ".    the inference engine will be the basic mamdani model @xcite , with if  then rules , minimax set  operations , sum for composition of activated rules , and defuzzification based on the centroid method .",
    "the mamdani model is congenial to capture and to code expert ",
    "based knowledge in view of performing targeted simulations ; accordingly the system s performance is tuned by means of expert  based choices , heuristic criteria and non  linear optimization methods .",
    "although creating a specific dataset of touching character is not our main contribution , in our research we faced the lacking of good and standardized datasets on which testing our algorithms .",
    "this reason forced us to build a dataset of touching characters .",
    "this need is shared with many other researchers and works , including recent ones as @xcite ( although this last paper refers to persian handwriting recognition algorithms rather than to latin characters - based ones ) .",
    "in particular , we created two different datasets for latin characters , one containing handwritten cursive characters , the other containing sided machine printed characters . in the following , we discuss our choices and methodology .    due to the different characteristics of the two datasets , in the remaining parts of the section we discuss the process to select the best parameters for running our method on the two datasets .",
    "our fuzzy strategy has specific parameters meant to capture the differences between one dataset to another .",
    "such parameters are tailored on the specific dataset characteristic by using an heuristic way and non  linear optimization methods .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that the three features combined in our fuzzy routine seem to be sufficient for obtaining optimal results in the segmentation . in facts , adding further features appear to be useless .",
    "for instance , we have verified that the use of the crossing count as a fourth fuzzy input did not lead to improvements .",
    "the experimental results are presented in the following .",
    "the ultimate purpose of getting good segmentation results , especially when touching character are considered , is to boost the the performances for what concerns overall recognition accuracy . despite the fact thus that , to be fair , different approaches should be evaluated on the basis of their recognition performances , there are not many authors publishing their results on a benchmark database @xcite",
    "also , as stated in many state - of - the - art work , e.g. , @xcite , unfortunately at the present a comprehensive dataset specific on touching characters is still missing . given",
    "that , for researches it is difficult to conduct experiments and to analyze any proposed method ; in addition , it is hard to fair compare performances and results obtained from different authors .",
    "we try to overtake such an obstacle by proposing two datasets .",
    "0.2        0.29        0.245     the first one , called dataset a , contains images of handwritten cursive characters we have built relying on samples from a standard dataset , in fashion of @xcite . in particular",
    "we started from the ccc database @xcite .",
    "the ccc database contains 57293 samples of cursive characters that were manually extracted from images coming from different input sources , mainly related to american post services .",
    "they include both upper and lower case letters .",
    "each sample is stored as a binary matrix within the database , and accompanied with information about the size of the matrix itself and the character that is represented .",
    "starting from the whole database , we developed a matlab script to randomly extract 1000 of its samples , taking care of maintaining a uniform distribution for all the characters chosen , both in their upper and lower version .",
    "these samples were later combined and merged together to form two , three , and four touching character patterns , each of whom is accompanied by a textual descriptor indicating the index of the proper cut column ( or columns , in the case of three and four multiple touching character patterns ) .",
    "one sample of each category of patterns is shown in  [ fig : samples - hand ] .",
    "for instance , the descriptor of the sample represented in  [ fig : eh ] states that the proper column to cut to properly separate the  e \" and the  h \" characters is the @xmath28 .",
    "this merging is however unsupervised , and so improper combinations happen during the process .",
    "so , we had to filter out the most unrealistic ones .",
    "firstly , we discarded all the samples with significant difference in their heights . secondly ,",
    "we manually removed combinations without touching patterns ( i.e. , the characters were well separated ) or with touching patterns that seemed impossible to happen in real world . at the end",
    ", we kept 153 combinations , of which 139 represent two touching character patterns , and the other are equally divided into three and four touching character patterns .",
    "the disproportion because the common touching characters consist of two characters , while three or more touching characters are rare @xcite",
    ". moreover , note that the quantity of combinations of touching characters contained in our dataset is in compliance with other similar datasets constructed using the ccc database ( e.g. , in @xcite a dataset of 123 touching characters is used ) .",
    "0.2        0.243        0.31     the second one , called dataset b , contains images of sided machine printed characters we have built resorting on a second matlab script .",
    "we have identified a list of font types ( namely cambria , candara , georgia , lucida sans regular , times new roman and verdana bold ) and sizes ( namely 10 , 20 and 25 ) ; for each type and size a matlab script combines into images the lower characters from the alphabet to form two , three , and four touching character patterns .",
    "each image is accompanied by a textual descriptor , which in this case indicates directly the characters represented .",
    "one sample of each category of patterns is shown in  [ fig : samples - machine ] .",
    "for instance , the descriptor of the sample represented in  [ fig : ax ] states that the images represent the string",
    "also in this case , we preferred to revise manually the dataset to remove missing , or unrealistic , touching patterns . at the end",
    ", we kept the most promising 189 combinations ( where 168 are composed by two touching characters ) , in order to define a challenging dataset to test our approach .",
    "in the following , we discuss the results of segmentation of touching characters from the dataset b described in the previous section , accordingly to the fuzzy strategy described in section [ sec : fuzzy ] .",
    "fuzzy sets and membership functions related to @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined accordingly to expert based choices . moreover",
    ", their construction has been optimized by using the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm @xcite in order to improve overall performances of our fuzzy strategy .",
    "similarly , the fuzzy rules ( described in the following ) have been tuned using both heuristic criteria and the pso algorithm .    given a matrix @xmath11 as defined in section [ sec : fuzzy ] , for each column @xmath4 of @xmath11 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are evaluated and",

    "the proposed method combines three classical features of touching characters usually exploited one at a time .",
    "experiments have been conducted on two very different datasets composed by latin printed and handwritten characters , respectively .",
    "fuzzy sets , membership functions , and fuzzy rules , which characterize the fuzzy inference scheme , have been properly constructed by means of expert  based choices , heuristic criteria , and the pso algorithm for each dataset .",
    "numerical results are encouraging and show that the proposed method has an optimal capability of correctly separating touching characters and may be adjusted for very different varieties of characters ( not only for the types considered in our experiments ) .",
    "our research activity have shown that even by using alone the functions @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 it is sometime possible to correctly segmenting touching characters .",
    "in fact , some experiments ( not presented here ) have shown that adding other inputs to the fuzzy routine does not provide significant improvements .",
    "this is surely a perspective that should be further investigated and motivated . indeed , looking at perspective advancements , the following issues could be addressed in future works :    * study of characterization of performance improvements when adding further features as inputs in the fuzzy inference system ; * experiments on further datasets not involving latin characters ; * experiments on segmentation of formulae , taking also into account possibility of segmenting touching characters vertically , horizontally and diagonally ; * use of fuzzy models different form the mamdani one ( as , e.g. , the sugeno model ) .",
