    "<S> we study the initial - boundary value problem for a nonlinear wave equation given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are given constants and @xmath3 are given functions . + in this paper , we consider two main parts . in part 1 , under a certain local lipschitzian condition on @xmath4 with @xmath5 ; @xmath6 , @xmath1 ; @xmath2 , a global existence and uniqueness theorem is proved . the proof is based on the paper [ 10 ] associated to a contraction mapping theorem and standard arguments of density . in part 2 , the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath7 as @xmath8 is studied , under more restrictive conditions , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and some others ( @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18 norm ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that under these conditions , a unique solution @xmath19 exists on @xmath20 such that @xmath21 decay exponentially to @xmath22 as @xmath23 . </S>",
