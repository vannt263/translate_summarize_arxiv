    "halo white dwarfs have received a continuous interest during almost one decade from the theoretical ( mochkovitch et al . 1990 ; tamanaha et al . 1990 ) and observational points of view . from this last point of view",
    "liebert , dahn & monet ( 1989 ) studied a high proper motion sample and from it derived the first  and up to now the only one available  halo white dwarf luminosity function . later flynn , gould & bahcall ( 1996 ) and mndez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied the white dwarf content of the hubble deep field , after the suggestion of the macho team that most of the dark matter in the galactic halo could be in the form of white dwarfs ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) , with negative results .",
    "the observational white dwarf luminosity function of the halo was obtained from a sample of white dwarfs with known parallaxes , large proper motions @xmath0 , using a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 and assuming that only white dwarfs with tangential velocities in excess of 250 km  s@xmath2 were halo members ( liebert et al .",
    "consequently only 5 white dwarfs contribute to the luminosity function and , thus , the statistics is very poor . besides , in the sample of liebert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) there is not any bright halo white dwarf .",
    "the absence of bright halo white dwarfs in this sample could be due to an observational bias but this issue , which bears important consequences regarding the imf of halo stars , remains to be studied , since the biased imfs recently proposed by adams & laughlin ( 1996 ) and by chabrier , sgretain & mra ( 1996 ) predict very few bright halo white dwarfs if the halo age is large enough ( isern et al . 1998 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we address the issue of whether or not there exist other halo white dwarfs in the existing catalogs and how do we identify them . for this purpose",
    "we use a neural network technique . in the end , this will allow us to present a preliminary luminosity function of halo white dwarfs and compare it with the theoretical predictions .",
    "with the advent of large astronomical databases the need of efficient techniques to improve automatic classification strategies has lead to a considerable amount of new developments in the field . among these techniques the most promising ones are based in artificial intelligence algorithms .",
    "neural networks have been used successfully in several fields such as pattern recognition , financial analysis , biology  see kohonen ( 1990 ) for an excellent review  and in astronomy .",
    "for instance , bezell & peng ( 1998 ) used these techniques to automatically discriminate stars from galaxies , naim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used them to classify galaxies according to their morphology , serra - ricart et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found the fraction of binaries in stars clusters , and hernndez - pajares & floris ( 1994 ) used such techniques to classify populations in the _ hipparcos input catalogue_.    the common characteristic of all the existing neural network classification techniques is the existence of a learning process very much in the same manner as human experts manually classify .",
    "generally speaking there are two different approaches : the supervised and the unsupervised learning methods .",
    "the main advantage of the last class of methods is that require minimum manipulation of the input data and , thus , the results are supposedly more reliable .",
    "their leading exponent is the so - called kohonen self - organizing map ( som ) .",
    "a thourough description of this technique is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , we refer the reader to the specific literature ( kohonen 1997 ) .",
    "however for our purpose it is convenient to summarize its basic principle and properties .",
    "the basic principle is to map a multi - dimensional input space @xmath3 into a bi - dimensional space @xmath4 .",
    "similar objects in @xmath5 ( groups ) are mapped in nodes in @xmath6 .",
    "the most noticeable property of this procedure is the reduction of the dimensionality of the input space allowing , at the same time , the identification of groups in the input data and the automatic classification of individual objects . besides",
    ", neighbor groups in @xmath6 have similar properties .",
    "the catalog of mccook & sion ( 1987 ) compiles the observational data of 1279 white dwarfs . in order to classify the stellar populations presumably present in this catalog a set of variables describing their properties",
    "should be adopted .",
    "it should be noted that the larger the set of variables adopted , the smaller the number of objects that will have determinations for all the variables .",
    "conversely , if the number of variables in the set is small we could be disregarding valuable information .",
    "we have adopted a minimal set in order to be able to analyse the largest possible number of objects in the catalog .",
    "the variables adopted in this study are : the absolute visual magnitude @xmath7 , the proper motion @xmath8 , the galactic coordinates @xmath9 , the parallax @xmath10 , and a color index , @xmath11 .",
    "this reduces considerably the number of objects with _ all _ the determinations , but allows a secure classification .",
    "we have found very convenient to use the reduced proper motion defined as @xmath12 , instead of @xmath8 itself because the resulting groups are easier to visualize .",
    "the statistical classification of an observational database usually ends up with the detection of groups in the input space that require an `` a posteriori '' analysis . since we are interested in detecting different stellar populations , simultaneously with the clustering process we mix in the input data a synthetic population of tracer stars that will allow us to _ label _ the groups detected by the classification algorithm as halo , disk or intermediate population .",
    "the results of the classification procedure are not sensitive to the fine details of these synthetic populations , except to the imf .",
    "these synthetic tracer stars have been produced using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulator .",
    "the description of the mc simulation of the disk population can be found in garca - berro & torres ( 1997 ) or garca - berro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . a comprehensive discussion of the results of the mc simulation of the halo population will be published elsewhere . however , and for the sake of completeness , a brief summary of the inputs is given here .",
    "we have adopted a standard , salpeter - like , imf ( salpeter 1961 ) .",
    "the halo was supposed to be formed 14 gyr ago in an intense burst of star formation of 1 gyr of duration .",
    "the stars are randomly distributed in a sphere of radius 200 pc centered in the sun according to a density profile given by the expression @xmath13 , being @xmath14 the galactocentric radius , @xmath15 kpc and @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the velocities of the tracer stars where randomly drawn according to normal distributions for both the radial and the tangential components , with velocity dispersions as given in markovi & sommer - larsen ( 1997 ) ; the adopted rotation velocity @xmath17 is 220 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the remaining inputs were the same adopted in garca - berro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in order to reproduce accurately the properties of the real catalog",
    "both mc simulations were required to meet the additional set of criteria : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are derived from the subset of 232 white dwarfs which have all the determinations .",
    "an added value of the above described procedure of mixing tracer and real stars is that in this way we can check the accuracy of the classification algorithm and the quality of the mc simulations .",
    "the simulated samples mimic fairly well the observational sample as can be seen in figure 1 , where the results of the mc simulations for the disk and the halo are compared with the observational sample in the reduced proper motion - color diagram .",
    "as can be seen in this diagram the two simulated samples are easily visualized .",
    "similar diagrams can be produced for each pair of variables and the results of the mc simulations compare equally well with the real data .",
    "we have run the public domain neural network software som_pak ( available at http://www.cis.hut.fi/nnrc/som_pak/ ) with a catalog constructed as described above .",
    "the som of the input catalog , after three passes over the entire sample and with a grid of @xmath22 nodes is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the groups have been assigned either to halo ( `` h '' ) or disk ( `` d '' ) populations if the percentage of tracer stars of one of the populations was larger than 70% . in the groups labeled as `` i '' ( intermediate population ) neither the halo nor the disk tracers were in excess of this recognition percentage . as can be seen in figure 2",
    "all the halo groups are close neighbors and , furthermore , the intermediate population groups are surrounded by halo and disk groups .",
    "a good measure of the overall quality of the classification scheme can be obtained by checking how many of the synthetic stars are missclassified .",
    "this results in the following confusion matrix    @xmath23    where the matrix element @xmath24 indicates the percentage of disk tracers classified in disk groups , @xmath25 is the percentage of disk tracers missclassified in halo groups , and so on .",
    "this matrix is very close to unity , and thus the classification seems to be secure .",
    "more confidence in this classification comes from the fact that the vast majority of old disk white dwarfs in the sample of liebert , dahn & monet ( 1988 ) are in the groups ( 0,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) which are labeled as intermediate population .",
    "moreover , lhs  56 , lhs  147 and lhs  291 belong to the group ( 1,0 ) which clearly is a halo group , and lhs  2984 belongs to the group ( 0,0 ) , all these objects were already identified as halo members by liebert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and were used to build their halo white dwarf luminosity function .",
    "the only object of the sample of liebert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) missclassified is lhs  282 which is classified in the group ( 0,2 ) , which is intermediate population .",
    "all this evidence points in the same direction : the classification is correct .",
    "the percentages of halo tracers in the groups labeled as halo can be found for each of the halo groups in figure 2 .",
    "since all of them are larger than 80% all these groups can be securely labeled as halo . however , and for the sake of reliability we have only identified as halo candidates those white dwarfs belonging to groups which do not have a disk neighbor , namely ( 0,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,0 ) and ( 2,0 ) .",
    "one interesting property of these white dwarfs is that all of them have @xmath26 and only 4 have proper motions in excess of @xmath27 , being the average @xmath28 .",
    "however , most of them have @xmath29 , and are clustered around @xmath30 , leading to tangential velocities in excess of 200 km  s@xmath2 for 11 of our candidates .",
    "only one candidate has a tangential velocity smaller than 100 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore the detected population is intrinsically bright and distant .",
    "the halo white dwarf candidates detected here can be found in table 1 .",
    "we have used the @xmath31 method to derive a luminosity function of halo white dwarfs with the candidates found so far .",
    "the adopted criteria for deriving such a luminosity function were those of oswalt et al .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 as solid triangles .",
    "the error bars have been computed as in liebert et al .",
    "the number of objects in each luminosity bin is shown on top of the corresponding error bar .",
    "the value of @xmath32 indicates that the sample is not complete .",
    "thus , this halo white dwarf luminosity function should be considered as preliminary although represents a considerable improvement over that of liebert et al .",
    "according to the previous discussion , the most obvious feature of this luminosity function is the detection of halo candidates for the brightest luminosity bins . the faintest halo candidate found by liebert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , lhs  282 , has been classified as intermediate population and , therefore , the faintest bin in their luminosity function is absent in ours .",
    "some other small differences for the faintest bins are due to the binning procedure and to the bolometric magnitudes assigned to individual objects  we have used the bolometric corrections of bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , whereas liebert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) used blackbody bolometric corrections .    for comparison purposes in figure 3",
    "we also show two theoretical luminosity functions computed with a standard imf .",
    "the adopted ages were in both cases 14 gyr , and the durations of the bursts were 1 gyr .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a luminosity function computed with a h envelope ( wood 1995 ) whereas the dotted line shows the luminosity function obtained using a he dominated envelope ( wood & winget 1989 ) .",
    "the method used to compute both luminosity functions is that of isern et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where the rest of the details of the adopted inputs can be found . also shown in figure 3 is the detection limit of very faint white dwarfs ( open triangles ) of liebert et al .",
    "both luminosity functions have been normalized to the bin with the smallest error bars and present a reasonable agreement with both sets of observational data .",
    "we have shown that an artificial intelligence algorithm is able to classify the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs and ultimately detect several potential halo white dwarfs .",
    "some of these white dwarfs were already proposed as halo objects by liebert et al .",
    "we have found as well that our halo candidates are bright and distant , and that most of them have large tangential velocities . using the @xmath31 method",
    "we have computed a preliminary luminosity function of halo white dwarfs .",
    "we have found a value of @xmath33 which indicates that our luminosity function is still uncomplete .",
    "however , this luminosity function largely improves the previous one by liebert et al .",
    "we have also compared this luminosity function with the theoretical predictions , and we have found a fair agreement with the luminosity functions computed with a standard imf .",
