    "recent observational studies of the high - redshift universe have begun to yield direct information on the nature of the population of `` normal '' galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "color - selected searches have started to produce growing , spectroscopically - confirmed samples ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while larger samples of objects identified solely on the basis of multicolor photometry have been used to boost statistics ( e.g. , @xcite ; sawicki , lin & yee 1997 ; @xcite ) . whether spectroscopically confirmed or not , such high-@xmath9 objects are often called `` lyman - break galaxies '' or `` u - band drop - outs '' .",
    "the names reflect the fact that in these galaxies the uv flux is severly attenuated by the combined effects of internal and intergalactic lyman line and continuum opacity . unlike serendipitously discovered single objects ,",
    "these new samples of high-@xmath9 galaxies are large enough to allow the study of global properties of the @xmath0 galaxy _ population _ , such as their number density , luminosity density , luminosity function , and rates of star formation and metal ejection .    despite this recent progress , there is much that still remains unclear .",

    "estimates of star formation rates in lyman break galaxies are based on their rest - frame uv fluxes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

( 1997 ) .",
    "these two different results , obtained from the same data , reflect the fact that both dust and aging have similar effects on the uv shape of the sed and that one can mimick the effects of the other .",

    "the use of the ir data is crucial , as at @xmath25 the optical data alone give coverage only bluewards of rest-2000   , while the ir extends this to rest-5500   , thereby spanning the age - sensitive balmer break .",

    "the reddened seds were appropriately redshifted and then convolved with the instrumental transmission curves ( in the case of the hst data ) or filter transmission curves ( for the kitt peak ir observations ) producing a suite of model colors . for each object",
    "this suite of model colors contains two possible star formation histories ( instantaneous burst and constant star formation ) , 221 ages ( 020 gyr ) , three different metallicities ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) , and a range of reddening ( @xmath43 to @xmath44 in steps of 0.02 ) .    why were these particular ingredients chosen for the models ? _ initial mass function : _ the initial mass function , at least in low - redshift starbursts , appears to be independent of environment and is consistent with the salpeter imf with a high ( @xmath45 ) upper mass cutoff ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have thus chosen to use the salpeter @xmath46 imf available in the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) library .",
    "_ reddening curve : _ since , by virtue of their color selection criteria ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the 17 spectroscopically confirmed hdf lyman break objects are star - forming , the use of the calzetti ( 1997 ) reddening curve for star - forming regions is appropriate . unlike the commonly - used lmc and smc reddening curves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which are are derived for stars alone , the calzetti curve holds for star - forming _ regions _ ; it thus automatically includes such effects as back - scattering and geometrical distribution of dust and is therefore much more appropriate for correcting the effects of dust on the photometry of star - forming galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "using the lmc reddening law would produce extinction values 2.53 times lower than that which we find (   [ discuss_sfr ] ) with the more appropriate calzetti extinction curve .",
    "_ metallicity : _ damped ly-@xmath21 systems at @xmath47 have metallicities @xmath48 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; thus @xmath41 or @xmath40 are reasonable values to expect for the metallicity of lyman break galaxies , while @xmath49 provides a useful check in case the metallicity of lyman break objects were significantly higher than that of damped ly-@xmath21 clouds .",
    "_ ages : _ at @xmath50 the universe is only 1  2 gyr old and no object within it can be older than that ; we have , however , allowed for model ages of up to 20 gyr as a consistency check of the fits .",
    "_ star formation history : _ in reality , the most likely star - formation scenario is that of a burst in which the star formation rate ( sfr ) declines with time .",
    "the two star formation histories used ( instantaneous burst and constant sfr ) thus provide the bracketing cases of the likely star formation histories of these objects .",
    "dust contents and ages of stellar populations obtained from these two extremes will then bracket the actual values of age and reddening .    for high - redshift objects ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen contained in ly-@xmath21 clouds along the line of sight provides an extra source of opacity in the uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of extinction provided by this mechanism is stochastic and depends on the numbers , redshift distribution , and column densities of the ly-@xmath21 clouds along the line of sight to the target galaxy .",
    "the galaxy s uv flux is affected blueward of rest-1216    and is almost completely extinguished below rest-912   .",
    "whereas this effect is of great usefulness in identifying high-@xmath9 galaxies , its stochastic nature introduces uncertainties below @xmath51 1200    in the sed models for individual galaxies .",
    "these stochastic uncertainties , combined with the fact that the dust reddening curve is not well known below 1200   , led us to decide not to fit the two bluest filters ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus all the fits presented in this paper have been done using the 5 reddest filters ( @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) .",
    "metallicity ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath49 ) and star formation history ( instantaneous burst and constant sfr ) were fixed , giving six scenarios . in each of these six scenarios , age since the onset of star formation and amount of dust were free parameters .",
    "the models and the data were compared by means of @xmath54 minimization . as an illustration , figure  [ best_fit_mosaic.fig ] shows the fits thus obtained with the @xmath41 continuous - sfr models .",
    "instantaneous burst models , as well as those for @xmath55 and @xmath42 , produced fits of similar quality .",
    "note that the two bluest filters , although not used to produce the fit , match the best - fitting model seds quite well .    because reddening increases towards shorter wavelengths , the part of the sed which contains information about dust attenuation is the rest - frame uv .",
    "dust attenuation can , however , be mimicked by aging of the stellar population : as the population ages , massive stars die out and the uv flux decreases .",
    "for example , below rest-3000 a zero - age sed with @xmath56 looks very much like a 100 myr , constant sfr , dust - free one .",
    "the availability of ir data allows the lifting of this degeneracy between age and reddening : at @xmath0 , ir data are probing the rest - optical part of the sed and consequently measure the age by means of the size of the balmer break and , to a lesser degree , the slope of the continuum redward of rest-4000 .",
    "metallicity effects could pose a problem because of the age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we have monitored their effects by performing fits with models of different metallicity ( @xmath57 , @xmath53 , and @xmath49 ) . as will be seen later , no overwhelming metallicity effects have been found .    with increasing redshift , the rest wavelengths probed by each filter move more and more blueward ( by @xmath58 , the @xmath30 filter is centered at 4000 ) and consequently less and less information is available about the age - sensitive rest - optical part of the sed .",
    "thus , past @xmath26 , only one filter ( @xmath31 ) is redward of the 4000  break . because of this loss of age - sensitive information at higher redshifts",
    ", we have chosen to split the sample at @xmath26 .",
    "we consider fits for the 11 objects at @xmath59 to be much more reliable than those for the six at @xmath60 .",
    "the results and discussion presented below are mainly based on the 11 @xmath59 galaxies ; we will , however , retain the six @xmath60 objects for completeness and as a consistency check .      for each object the models described above fit simultaneously the dust content and the age of the dominant stellar population .",
    "the age and @xmath39 parameters of the best - fitting @xmath53 models are plotted in figure  [ ebv_vs_age.fig ] , with error bars corresponding to 90% confidence limits .",
    "the figure illustrates that the lyman break objects are best fitted by models which require non - zero amounts of dust .",
    "the median values for both the instantaneous burst and constant sfr @xmath53 scenarios are @xmath61 , producing a factor of 16 attenuation at 1600 .",
    "this attenuation value is in agreement with the result derived from the uv spectral indices by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that meurer et al .  had to assume ( correctly , as we shall see in   [ fit_ages ] ) that the @xmath0 galaxies are no older than 0.3 gyr .",
    "just as in the @xmath53 case , the @xmath57 and @xmath49 models reqiure significant amounts of dust .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ ebv_hist.fig ] which shows the distribution of @xmath39 values for the six different scenarios .",
    "dust is required for the vast majority of galaxies in all of the six scenarios . for sub - solar metallicities ( @xmath57 and @xmath53 ) typical values are @xmath1 and somewhat lower ( @xmath62 ) for the unlikely case of solar metallicity .",
    "can dust - free models be securely ruled out ?",
    "the error bars in figure  [ ebv_vs_age.fig ] are 90% confidence limits ; hence , at 90% confidence , non - zero amounts of dust are unavoidable in all but one or two of the 11 @xmath59 objects .",
    "the presence of dust is further illustrated in figure  [ nodust_fits.fig ] , where , for three objects , the best possible dust - free models are compared with those in which dust is allowed .",
    "more qualitatively , the median reduced @xmath63 are 1.34 and 1.68 for the instantaneous burst ad constant sfr @xmath53 fits with dust ; the corresponding dust - free values are 5.04 and 10.1 .",
    "models with dust give much better fits than those without it .",
    "therefore we conclude that dust is present in lyman break galaxies .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by ellingson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the @xmath13 galaxy cb58 , which has relatively high - precision ir photometry .",
    "the high reddening values obtainded here from broadband photometry of lyman break galaxies are in contrast to the negligible extinctions inferred from chemical abundances in damped ly@xmath21 systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , while quasar sightlines probe essentially random regions of damped ly@xmath21 galaxies , broadband photometry targets regions of star formation .",
    "thus , if the star - forming regions have substantially different dust - to - gas ratios than `` random '' parts of high - redshift galaxies , then the discrepancy between the damped ly@xmath21 spectroscopic and our photometric results may simply reflect the differences in the environments that the two methods probe .",
    "star formation rates have been derived from the fluxes of either h@xmath21 or h@xmath64 for the small number of high - redshift objects for which these fluxes have been measured ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these objects ,",
    "line - based sfr measurements are generally lower than the dust - corrected star - formation rates derived from uv fluxes .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can , however , be caused by a number of effects other than discrepant dust measurements ; these effects include leakeage of lyman - limit photons from regions , absorption of lyman - limit photons by dust , and a non - standard imf ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these effects may affect the reliability of sfr measurements based on emission lines . ultimately , _",
    "concurrent _ measurements of h@xmath21/h@xmath64 ratios will provide a robust and independent estimate of the dust content in lyman break galaxies .    based on our analysis ,",
    "the presence of dust in lyman break galaxies seems unavoidable with @xmath1 being typical . as will be discussed in ",
    "[ discuss_sfr ] , these amounts of dust are large enough to significantly affect estimates of star formation and metal ejection rates at high redshift .      for each galaxy , we shall date the age of the galaxy s dominant stellar population .",
    "it must be emphashized that the age of the dominant stellar population does not mean the age of the galaxy itself , but rather corresponds to the time since the onset of the most recent major episode of star formation .",
    "note that the instantaneous burst and constant sfr models are the limiting - case scenarios , while a galaxy s star formation history probably lies somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "thus , the instantaneous burst model provides the lower bound , while the constant sfr model gives the upper bound on the likely age of the galaxy s current episode of star formation .",
    "figure 2 presents the parameters of the best - fitting @xmath53 models , while figure 5 shows the distribution of galaxy ages for all six combinations of metallicity and star formation history .",
    "as these figures illustrate , in the constant sfr scenario the vast majority of @xmath59 objects , for which spectral coverage is sufficient in the red , are best fit with models for which the ages of dominant stellar populations are less than 0.2 gyr . in the instantaneous burst scenario ,",
    "the ages of virtually all the objects , including the six with @xmath60 , are less than 0.1 gyr .",
    "the median ages for the @xmath59 objects are 36 myr and 10 myr in the @xmath53 constant sfr and instantaneous burst scenarios , respectively .",
    "although objects at @xmath60 have insufficient ir coverage to constrain ages reliably , their fits are also consistent with very young stellar populations ; for the instantaneous burst scenarios these ages are as young as for the @xmath59 objects .    how confidently can we rule out older ages of stellar populations ?",
    "the error bars in figure  [ ebv_vs_age.fig ] are 90% confidence limits .",
    "if we consider the constant sfr model ( which is more favorable for long ages ) , we see that of the @xmath59 objects all but one must have ages @xmath65  1  gyr at the 90% confidence level .",
    "a further illustration of the necessity of young ages is given in figure  [ 1gyr_fits.fig ] : the ( forced ) 1  gyr - old models produce poorer fits than the unforced younger models .",
    "more qualitatively , whereas the median reduced @xmath54 are 1.34 and 1.68 for the @xmath53 instantaneous burst and constant sfr models with free age , the corresponding values for the forced 1gyr fits are 355.2 and 6.67 , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath0 lyman break galaxies are dominated by very young stellar populations .",
    "a possible concern is that the imf employed to generate the models ( i.e. , the salpeter @xmath66 imf ) may not reflect the true imf in the lyman break galaxies . in particular , the determination of the age of the stellar population is primarily sensitive to the size of the balmer break , which grows as the population ages . since",
    "low - mass stars are responsible for the balmer break , an imf deficient in low - mass stars would produce a balmer break that is smaller than expected for a given age , thereby mimicking the signature of a younger stellar population . consequently , for an imf deficient in low - mass star , our fits would underestimate the ages of stellar populations .",
    "the multi - metallicity seds of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) are available only for the @xmath67 imf .",
    "hence , to estimate the impact of an imf with a high lower - mass cutoff , we have compared the predicted colors of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) solar metallicity models with different imf mass ranges .",
    "specifically , we have compared the @xmath37 and @xmath68 salpeter imfs .",
    "the comparison reveals that , for the young ages in question and _ if _ the imf is deficient in low - mass stars , the age of the star - forming population can be underestimated by a factor of @xmath69 in the instantaneous burst scenarios ; in the constant sfr models the underestimate is only at the 10% level .",
    "these effects would then increase the median age in either scenario to no more than @xmath70 myr .",
    "imf effects are thus unlikely to affect our conclusion that the lyman break objects have very young stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ age_z_2models.fig ] shows , as a function of redshift , ages of stellar populations obtained with the @xmath53 seds .",
    "the age of the @xmath3 , @xmath71 gyr universe and the age of an object which formed at @xmath72 are shown for comparison .",
    "lyman break galaxies are , by and large , dominated by very young stellar populations .",
    "the absence of older ( age @xmath73 gyr ) objects , particularly at the lower end of the redshift range covered , is remarkable .",
    "possible reasons for this absence will be discussed in   [ discuss_ages ] .",
    "to estimate the star formation rates in lyman break galaxies , we use the constant sfr fits . for each of the observed objects , we obtain the sfr by comparing the normalization of the fit to that of a @xmath74 model of identical age and reddening . for the @xmath59 objects , @xmath53 constant sfr models , and @xmath3 , the median sfr is @xmath75 ( @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) .",

    "the agreement occurs because the lower star formation rate of the dust - free models are offset by their older ages .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the total stellar mass formed to the assumed star formation history and dust content of the galaxy allows us to obtain a robust result for the typical mass produced by a star formation episode in a lyman break galaxy . averaging the median masses calculated from the dust - corrected instantaneous burst and constant sfr fits , we have that the median stellar mass produced in an episode of star formation in an hdf lyman break galaxy is @xmath96 for @xmath87 .",

    "( 1997 ) on the basis of ly@xmath21 emission line widths and is equivalent to @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) the stellar mass of a present - day @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "intervening dust has the effect of absorbing uv photons , thereby suppressing the observed uv flux .",
    "if , as the sed fits discussed in   [ fit_dust_content ] indicate , @xmath0 objects have substantial amounts of internal reddening , recent measurements of the rates of star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and metal ejection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) need to be revised .",
    "steidel et al .  (",
    "1996a ) have used rest-1500  fluxes to estimate the average star formation rate of their lyman break galaxy sample to be @xmath81 for @xmath3 ( and @xmath100 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "if we assume that their objects suffer from the same amount of reddening as is typical for the lyman break objects in the hubble deep field ( @xmath101 ) , then their sfr estimates need to be adjusted upward to @xmath102 for @xmath3 ( and to @xmath103 for @xmath83 ) .    on the basis of 1500  fluxes , lowenthal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) made estimates of star formation rates both in individual @xmath50 hdf objects and in the volume - averaged population .",
    "reddening correction would bring the lowenthal et al .",
    "range of star formation rates to @xmath104 for @xmath3 ( @xmath105 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "the volume - averaged star formation rates given by lowenthal et al .",
    "need likewise be adjusted upwards by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied a sample of u- and b - band dropouts in the hubble deep field .",
    "they used the comoving uv ( 1620   at @xmath107 and 1630   at @xmath108 ) luminosity densities to estimate the volume - averaged rates of metal ejection and star formation .",
    "if we apply the typical @xmath61 extinction found to occur in @xmath0 galaxies , the madau et al .",
    "estimates of both the star formation and metal ejection rates need to be revised upward by a factor of 16 .",
    "this value is consistent with the factor of 15 derived by meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the basis of optical data alone and with the ( as we have seen , correct ) assumption of young ages .",
    "note , however , that the madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimates do not include incompleteness corrections , so they remain lower limits even after having been corrected for dust .    as part of their photometric redshift study of the hubble deep field , sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have calculated the expected metal density of the universe as a function of redshift .",
    "to do so , they have used rest-3000  luminosity densities . applying @xmath61 of extinction yields a factor of 7 increase in flux at 3000 , requireing a factor of 7 increase in the @xmath109 metallicity of the universe shown in fig .  10 .",
    "of sawicki et al .    in summary ,",
    "the values of star formation and metal ejection rates presented in the literature are underestimates , since they do not account for intrinsic reddening .",
    "though the exact correction factors depend on the wavelength used for the original estimate , once correction for dust is made , both star formation and metal ejection rates go up by about an order of magnitude .",
    "note that although the total mass of stars formed per object is similar for the dust - free and dust - included models (   [ masses ] ) , the difference in the volume - averaged star formation and metal ejection rates of the universe enters via the very different duty cycle of visibility which the lyman break objects have in these two models .      for all but one of the @xmath59 hdf lyman break galaxies ,",
    "the ages of the dominant stellar populations are @xmath110 gyr .",
    "since our redshift range ( @xmath111 ) spans a gyr in time , the lack of a significant number of galaxies with old ( @xmath73 gyr ) stellar populations suggests that , in lyman break galaxies , the duration of star formation is short rather than extended and continuous .",
    "in the rest of this section we will speculate on some of the possible interpretations of this episodic star formation . using simple calculations",
    ", we will show that under this single - burst scenario the number densities of lyman break objects , in addition to their stellar masses , are consistent with lyman break objects being progenitors of present - day @xmath112 galaxies .",
    "they are unlikely to be the present - day @xmath113 galaxies caught in the act of creation unless one invokes more complicated mechanisms such as mergers or recurrent bursts of star formation .    in the simplest scenario ,",
    "akin to the low - mass starburst model of lowenthal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , each lyman break galaxy undergoes a single episode of star formation .",
    "since the stellar mass produced in a typical lyman break galaxy is @xmath6 (   [ masses ] ) , such a burst would result in a low - mass object whose stellar mass is @xmath98 that of a present - day @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "this typical mass is thus too low to account for the whole stellar mass of the bulge of a present - day @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "the young ages of their stellar populations , together with the fact that they will fade rapidly after star formation ends ( by @xmath114 magnitude in a mere 30 myr ) , mean that only a small fraction of such short - burst galaxies are visible at any one time .",
    "the redshift range covered by the hdf lyman break sample ( @xmath111 ) , spans a time interval of @xmath115 gyr in a @xmath116 , @xmath3 universe ( @xmath117 gyr for @xmath116 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "the median age from the @xmath53 , constant sfr fits is @xmath118 myr . assuming that a typical star - forming burst lasts twice that time , and that it takes @xmath119 myr for the galaxy to fade @xmath114 magnitude ( and hence out of the spectroscopic sample )",
    ", we estimate that a typical lyman break galaxy stays in the sample for @xmath120 myr .",
    "therefore , for every galaxy that is detected , there will be @xmath121 ( @xmath122 for @xmath83 ) objects which have faded beyond spectroscopic detectibility .",
    "hence , in the volume and redshift range sampled , there should be a total of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 , for @xmath83 ) visible _ plus _ faded objects which are undergoing , or have undergone , brief but intense bursts of star formation .",
    "the comoving number density of this combined ( both visible and faded ) population is @xmath125 ( @xmath126 for @xmath83 ) . in the @xmath31-band ( which corresponds to @xmath51 rest-@xmath127 )",
    ", the hdf lyman break galaxies span a range of @xmath128 magnitudes .",
    "locally , over a corresponding magnitude range , one expects to see @xmath129 galaxies with @xmath130 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the number density of hdf lyman break objects is thus similar to , or perhaps somewhat higher than , that of local @xmath131 galaxies .",
    "thus , on the basis of their number densities and stellar masses , lyman break objects are consistent with being progenitors of present - day sub-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "one could postulate that present - day @xmath132 galaxies formed through bursts of star formation which are analogous to those which seem to be producing the above - mentioned low - mass objects , but which are more intense though less numerous than the bursts seen in the hdf .",
    "based on the present - day luminosity function of lin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and assuming that the 17 objects seen in the hdf are precursors of present - day sub-@xmath8 galaxies , one would expect the hdf to yield @xmath69 lyman break objects with stellar masses @xmath133 , the expected stellar mass of an @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "the fact that such massive stellar populations are absent ( figure  [ masses.fig ] ) implies that most present - day massive galaxies did not form in single bursts of star formation at @xmath0 .",
    "there are , however , alternative ways to assemble massive objects .",
    "one option is through galaxy - galaxy merging : the present - day merger rate is rather low but increases as @xmath134 , at least to moderate redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . if this redshift trend continues to @xmath135 , then the merging of a dozen or so lyman break objects can easily result in the spheroid of a present - day @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "another possibility is akin to the `` christmas tree '' model of lowenthal et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this model , star formation is episodic but recurrent within each galaxy : star - forming episodes are separated by quiescent intervals during which the galaxy temporarily fades out of the sample .",
    "the underlying stellar population , resulting from previous star - forming bursts , would be too faded to be detectable in the presence of an ongoing burst ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "each of the recurrent star - forming bursts would then add , typically , @xmath6 of new stars to the galaxy , gradually building up its stellar mass .",
    "a spheroid containing @xmath136 worth of stars could be thus accumulated in a dozen or two such recurrent starburst episodes .",
    "we have fitted the broadband spectral energy distributions of spectroscopically confirmed @xmath0 hdf lyman break objects , using the multi - metallicity spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) . in the fits we have included correction for internal dust extinction typical of local star - forming galaxies ( calzetti 1997 ) . the fits also assume that the imf at high redshift is not unlike that seen locally , although some leeway is allowed , particularly in the lower mass cutoff .",
    "we find that lyman break galaxies are dominated by very young stellar populations ( @xmath137 gyr ) .",
    "the absence of objects with old stellar populations , particularly at lower redshifts ( @xmath138 ) , implies that star formation in a typical lyman break galaxy can not go on continuously for a prolonged time . instead",
    ", star formation must occur in bursts of short duration ( @xmath139 gyr ) .",
    "a typical lyman break galaxy is shrouded in enough dust to suppress its uv flux by a factor of @xmath140 at 1600 .",
    "consequently , recent uv - based estimates of the rates of star formation and metal ejection at high redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) need to be adjusted upwards by a similar factor .",
    "star formation rates in lyman break galaxies are high ( median of @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "these star formation rates typically produce @xmath143 of stellar mass during the lifetime of a star - forming episode ; this number is robust as it is relatively insensitive to the details of star formation history and dust content .",
    "this median stellar mass is equivalent to @xmath90@xmath144 the stellar mass contained in a present - day @xmath8 galaxy .",
    "objects with larger stellar masses may be built up through recurrent episodes of star formation , or can be assembled through mergers .",
    "a stellar population will fade rapidly after the end of a brief episode of star formation ( @xmath114  magnitude at rest-2000  in the first 30 myr ) . because star formation in lyman break galaxies is of brief duration",
    ", a substantial population of objects which have just recently faded out of the spectroscopic sample may exist at high redshift .",
    "we estimate that if a typical lyman break galaxy stays in our sample for 0.1 gyr , then there are 823 such faded galaxies for every visible one .",
    "the number density of the combined visible and faded population ( a few @xmath145 ) is comparable to the number density of present - day sub-@xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) galaxies .    on the basis of the evidence presented above ,",
    "we conclude that lyman break objects are likely direct progenitors of present - day * sub*-@xmath8 galaxies , or that they may form luminous galaxies through merging or by repeated episodes of star formation .",
    "they do _ not _ appear to be steadily star - forming direct progenitors of present - day massive galaxies .",
