    "the riemann hypothesis@xcite ( rh ) states that the only zeroes of @xmath1 which do not lie on the real axis lie on the critical line @xmath12 . it has resisted rigorous proof for over 150 years , and is now widely considered to be the most important unsolved problem in mathematics.@xcite the significance of the rh for physics has been shown by many authors.@xcite    the gram points@xcite are points on the critical line for which * im*@xmath0 but * re*@xmath13 . as stated by h. m. edwards,@xcite ",
    "to locate the gram points computationally is quite easy . \"",
    "the reason for this is that the spacing between neighboring gram points varies very smoothly , in sharp contrast to the spacing between neighboring zeroes on the critical line .",

    "the contour lines * im*@xmath0 and * re*@xmath0 are highly constrained by the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "an extensive discussion of their properties , including many illustrations , has been given by arias de reyna.@xcite in the work presented here , the author used the computer program of collins to study these lines.@xcite it is not practical to find double precision values for the locations of the gram points directly from the output of collins computer program . finding approximate values from the graphical output of this program , the accurate values used for fig .",
    "1 were taken from a list supplied to the author by michael rubinstein.@xcite    as shown by arias de reyna,@xcite two * im*@xmath0 contour lines which pass through special gram points can not intersect when @xmath21 .",
    "however , there is no general proof that contour lines of * im*@xmath0 can not intersect , although no such intersections are known to exist .",
    "a proof of this would immediately imply that all the zeroes of @xmath1 are simple , an unsettled issue which has been of interest for a long time .",
    "if it is possible for two * im*@xmath0 contour lines to intersect , then the strips bounded by the contour lines running through the special gram points might not be well defined .    in order for two of these * im*@xmath0 contour lines to intersect at a point @xmath22 , two conditions must be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the first condition is that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the derivative of @xmath1 .",
    "the second condition is that * im*@xmath25 .",
    "it is known@xcite that the rh requires that there be no zeroes of @xmath24 for @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the strips are well defined if the rh is true and in addition all the zeroes of @xmath1 are simple .    in this work we will study the properties of the special gram points and their associated contour lines . using data up to a height @xmath3 , we will find numerical evidence of some remarkable behavior which is a result of the way the smooth , monotonic variation in the spacings between neighboring gram points , as illustrated in fig",
    ".  1 , fits together with the strips bounded by the * im*@xmath0 contour lines .",
    "the average width of these strips does not depend on the height @xmath7 .",
    "the author suspects that this behavior is related in some way to dyson s conjecture@xcite about the connection of the rh with quasicrystals .",
    "we define the riemann - siegel phase @xmath27 by @xmath28 then the contour lines at the top and the bottom of each strip have @xmath29 = 1 , _ i.e. _ @xmath30 is an integer multiple of @xmath31 . counting the crossings of the critical line , @xmath11 = 1/2 , by these contour lines passing through the special gram points , we plot the number of strips as a function of the height @xmath7 for the first 1102 strips in fig .  2 .",

    "since there is a nontrivial distribution of strip widths , there is a small amount of jitter of the data around the fitting line .",
    "however , there is absolutely no indication of any curvature in the fit .",
    "the bottom of the first strip crosses the critical line at a height of @xmath7 = 9.6669080561 ... .",
    "it is therefore somewhat mysterious that the y - intercept of the fitting line is consistent ( within the statistical error ) with a value of zero .",
    "if one fits the heights of the tops of the strips instead , one finds ( unsurprisingly ) that the slope of the fitting line is essentially unchanged , but the y - intercept is now found to be 9.07(5 ) .    for large positive @xmath6 eqn .",

    ", it seems a reasonable conjecture that the strips remain essentially horizontal for any value of @xmath7 when @xmath38 , which implies that the slope of the least squares fit for the heights of the bottom of each strip will be independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the author sees no reason , however , why the y - intercept of this fit should be independent of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , it appears that for @xmath39 this y - intercept becomes clearly greater than zero .",
    "the reader should note that , since the sum on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) does not even converge for @xmath40 , it is rather surprising that the data taken on the critical line , shown in fig .",
    "2 , are well fit by a straight line with a slope of @xmath41 .",

    " ought \" to have .",
    "consistent with this idea , the vertical spacings between the nested arches for @xmath51 and @xmath49 are about 1/2 and 1/3 , respectively , of the vertical spacings of the @xmath52 arches . in addition , all of these vertical spacings are decreasing slowly as @xmath7 increases .    for the @xmath52 case eqn .",
    "( 8) is obtained by requiring that @xmath53 divided by the spacing between consecutive gram points at height @xmath7 be equal to @xmath44 .",
    "this is a kind of resonance effect between the average height of a strip and the spacing between gram points at height @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the expression for larger values of @xmath45 may be thought of as higher order resonances .",
    "it would , of course , be helpful to have an explicit analytical derivation of eqn .",

    "the average density of critical zeroes as a function of @xmath7 is actually known to a much greater precision than this , because it is identical to the average density of gram points .",

    "the spacing between these lines is decreasing with @xmath32 logarithmically .",
    "there is an observable tendency for the range of strip widths to increase as @xmath32 increases , so it is not obvious what the large @xmath32 behavior will be .    in order to understand the behavior of the deviations of the points from the lines , we perform an analysis similar to the one of figs . 3 to 7 . in fig .  11 to fig .  15",

    "each primary zero has the property that the contour with phase @xmath30 = 0 going out of it extends to @xmath57 , at a height @xmath58 for all the other critical zeroes , the contour with phase @xmath59 goes to @xmath60 .",
    "one can now ask the question  where is the primary zero located in the strip ?",
    "\" it seems obvious , by reason of symmetry , that the average position of the primary zero should be at the center of the strip . however , there is no symmetry reason why the probability distribution for the primary zero should be uniform . in fig .",
    "16 we display the values for the function ( number of the primary zero ( counting from the bottom of the strip ) @xmath61 ) divided by ( number of zeroes in the strip ) versus the strip number .",
    "the subtraction of 0.5 in the numerator is necessary so that this function has the value 0.5 when the primary zero is the middle zero .",
    "the linear least squares fit to the data of fig .",
    "16 shows that the average position of the primary zero is indeed at the center of the strip .",
    "remarkably , one sees that the width of this probability distribution seems to be independent of the height .",
    "this observation is quantitatively confirmed by calculating the variance for subsets of the data , which always gives a result close to 0.014 , independent of the range of @xmath7 used .",
    "if this probability distribution remains nontrivial ( _ i.e. _ neither becoming uniform nor collapsing ) in the limit @xmath62 , then we must conclude that all of the zeroes in a strip are a collective entity , and that the positions of these zeroes are highly correlated with each other .",
    "in this work we have done an analysis of some properties of the special gram points of the riemann zeta function . we have uncovered some previously unknown facets of the behavior of this remarkable function along its critical line .",
    "the most remarkable of these occur when the ratio between @xmath41 , the average strip width , and the spacing between gram points passes through integers or rational numbers of small denominator .",
