    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) consists of the cumulative emission from various pregalactic objects , protogalaxies and galaxies throughout the evolution of the universe .",
    "its detection is a subject of great scientific interest and the main purpose of the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) spacecraft ( boggess et al .",
    "the dirbe was designed to search for a cosmic infrared ( ir ) background , which is presumed to be spatially isotropic .",
    "the detection of the ebl at ir wavelengths is greatly hampered by the presence of strong foreground emission .",
    "the removal of these various layers of emission without affecting any potential extragalactic component is a formidable task which has been described by the dirbe team in three previous papers in this series : hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ; paper i ) summarized limits and detections of the ebl ; kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 ; paper ii ) described the subtraction of the interplanetary dust scattering and emission component ; and arendt et al . ( 1998 ; paper iii ) described the subtraction of the galactic stellar and diffuse interstellar emission components .",
    "a residual may be considered as extragalactic in origin if its signal is positive and isotropic .",
    "hauser et al . ( 1998 ) described in detail the tests conducted to examine whether significant residual emission exists at each of the dirbe wavelengths and , if so , whether that emission is isotropic .",
    "these studies resulted in upper limits on the ebl in the 1.25 - 100 @xmath0 m region , and in the detection of a positive isotropic signal at 140 and 240 @xmath0 m .",
    "furthermore , a detailed analysis of the data obtained with the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) instrument on the _ cobe _ resulted in a detection of the ebl in the 125 @xmath6 5000 @xmath0 m region ( fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ; paper v ) .",
    "the dirbe and firas isotropic residuals can be summarized as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the planck function at frequency @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the dirbe detections are smaller than , but consistent with , the detections reported by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the firas detections of fixsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are consistent with those of the dirbe , and , at wavelengths longer than 300 @xmath0 m , generally similar to the tentative detections reported by puget et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . a more detailed discussion of the comparison is given by hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fixsen et al .",
    "the integrated intensity of the background detected in the dirbe 140 and 240 @xmath0 m bands is 10.3 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 , and that detected by the firas in the 240 to 5000 @xmath0 m region is 5.3 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 , giving a total ebl intensity of @xmath5 16 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 in the @xmath5 125 to 5000 @xmath0 m wavelength interval .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the implications of these _ cobe _ measurements .",
    "we show in  2 and appendix @xmath12 that local sources in the solar system or the galaxy can not provide significant contributions to the residual isotropic emission at 140 and 240 @xmath0 m .",
    "no known component of the solar system can produce an isotropic emission component at the observed intensity in these two dirbe bands .",
    "furthermore , a hypothetical solar system component consistent with the various constraints provided by the dirbe observations is unlikely to survive or be maintained over the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "likewise , we argue that no galactic dust component can produce the observed far@xmath6infrared isotropic emission component .",
    "the residual emission detected by the dirbe and firas instruments is therefore of extragalactic origin . adopting the extragalactic nature of the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m residuals",
    ", we show that the detections in these bands imply a lower limit on the extragalactic contribution at 100 @xmath0 m as well (  3 ) .",
    "various cosmological implications of the _ cobe _ detections are addressed in this paper .",
    "\\(1 ) _ the origin of the ebl_. two major energy sources can contribute to the observed ebl : nuclear and gravitational .",
    "the nuclear contribution consists of the energy released in stellar nucleosynthetic processes .",
    "this energy is radiated predominantly at uv@xmath6visual wavelengths and either redshifted or absorbed and reradiated by dust into the infrared ( @xmath13 m ) wavelength region .",
    "gravitational potential energy dominates the energy released by brown dwarfs , accreting black holes , and gravitationally collapsing systems , and may make a significant contribution to the ebl ( see bond , carr , & hogan 1986 , 1991 , hereafter bch86 , bch91 ; carr 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) may contribute a significant fraction of the ebl in the mid - ir ( @xmath14 10@xmath650 @xmath0 m ) wavelength region ( granato , franceschini , & danese 1996 ) , and agns may be contributing to the ir energy released in starbursts as well .",
    "however , the magnitude of the agn contribution to the diffuse ir background is highly uncertain , since it depends on the amount of dust and the geometry of the torus around the active nucleus . a third possible source of energy",
    "is that released by decaying relic particles ( bch86 , 91 ) .",
    "since the infrared ebl should contain a significant fraction of _ all _ the energy released in the universe since the recombination epoch , its measurement can constrain the relative contribution of the various energy sources . for example , as discussed in paper i ( see also figure 9 in this paper ) , the intensity predicted for some non@xmath6nuclear energy sources ( e.g. bch86 , bch91 ) falls above the dirbe upper limits , indicating that these models are not viable without significant modifications .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the evolution of galaxies_. the intensity and spectrum of the ebl contains information on the evolution of the number density , luminosity , and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies over the history of the universe .",
    "the number density of galaxies is expected to evolve as galaxies merge and undergo a starbursting activity , or fade out of view .",
    "deep galaxy counts using data obtained by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) suggest either mild luminosity evolution , or comoving density evolution with redshift up to @xmath15 ( ashby et al .",
    "on theoretical grounds , the galaxy luminosity and sed are functions of its star formation activity , metallicity , and dust content , all evolving quantities that determine its far@xmath6ir appearance ( e.g. dwek & vrosi 1996 ; dwek 1998 ) .",
    "the _ cobe _ data can therefore be used to set constraints on these evolutionary processes .",
    "\\(3 ) _ the star formation history of the universe_. the spectrally@xmath6integrated ebl at ir wavelengths should contain much of the energy associated with the production of elements throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the ebl spectrum depends on the details of the cosmic star formation history , and the transport of the stellar energy through the ambient dusty environment . _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) provided important new constraints on the star@xmath6formation rates ( sfr ) at redshifts between @xmath5 2 and 5 ( madau et al .",
    "these observations suggest that the cosmic sfr at these redshifts falls significantly below those in the more local universe ( lilly , le fvre , hammer , & crampton 1996 ) , suggesting that the cosmic star formation activity peaked at redshifts of about 1@xmath61.5 . however , an important ongoing debate is whether the uv and optically ( uvo ) derived sfr inferred from ground@xmath6based and _ hst _ observations severely underestimates the actual star formation rate in the universe . using",
    "_ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ ) observations of the hdf , rowan@xmath6robinson et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter rr97 ) argued that the _ hst _ missed a significant fraction of the star formation activity that takes place in dust enshrouded galaxies at @xmath16 2 .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "data provide an important constraint on the star formation history of the universe , and can therefore confirm ( or rule out ) the presence of dust@xmath6enshrouded galaxies or star@xmath6forming regions that may have led to an underestimate of the cosmic sfr .    to address the origin of the ebl , we examine whether the intensity detected by the dirbe and firas is consistent with that expected from the he@xmath6enrichment and metal formation in the universe .",
    "assuming a nuclear origin for the observed ebl and a cosmic star formation history , one can set a lower limit on the mass fraction of baryonic matter that must have been processes into he and heavier elements in stars (  4 ) . to examine whether the _ cobe _ observations suggest any galaxy evolution , we develop a simple model to calculate the intensity and spectrum of the ebl (  5 ) . using a population synthesis model",
    "we calculate the spectral luminosity density produced by unattenuated starlight at each redshift .",
    "then , for a given magnitude of visual extinction and a galactic extinction law , we calculate the fraction of starlight that is absorbed by dust and converted into ir emission at each redshift . for simplicity , we assume that the extinction is constant as a function of redshift , and that the emitted ir spectrum is identical in shape to that produced by _ iras _ galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the spectrum of the ebl is then obtained by integrating the comoving spectral luminosity density of the attenuated starlight and the emitting dust over redshift . by examining the extent to which the spectrum calculated by this simple model deviates from the observed ebl",
    ", we can obtain clues to possible galactic evolutionary processes . to examine the constraints provided by the _",
    "cobe _ on the cosmic star formation history , we calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories .",
    "the resulting ebl spectra ( as well as those derived by other authors ) are compared to the observational constraints in  6 .",
    "the results of the paper are briefly summarized in  7 . a value of @xmath17 = 50 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 for the hubble constant , and a flat universe ( @xmath18 ) , with a zero cosmological constant ( @xmath19 = 0 ) is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "before studying the cosmological implications of the dirbe results , we must examine if local sources in the solar system or in the galaxy can contribute a significant fraction of the observed residual emission . given a @xmath20 emissivity law ,",
    "the temperature of a radiating particle is determined by the emissivity index , @xmath21 , and by the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m intensities attributed to these sources .",
    "further constraints on the temperature of the source are placed by the dirbe 1.25 @xmath6 100 @xmath0 m upper limits ( paper i ) , and the firas dark sky limits of @xmath5 12.2 1.3 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at 340 and 650 @xmath0 m , respectively ( shafer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 depicts the spectra of various hypothetical thermal sources that can contribute to the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m residual emission , for blackbody emitters characterized by an @xmath22 emissivity law ( fig 1a ) , and for dust particles characterized by an @xmath23 emissivity law ( fig 1b ) .",
    "the highest temperatures consistent with the dirbe upper limits is 100 k for blackbody particles , and 40 k for @xmath23 dust particles .",
    "blackbodies with temperatures lower than 18 k will violate the firas dark sky limits .",
    "this temperature is slightly above the value of @xmath5 16 k attained by such particles if they are only heated by the local isrf .",
    "the first firm conclusion that we can draw from these figures is that neither stars , stellar remnants , nor brown dwarfs can possibly contribute to the emission at these wavelengths at the level required to account for a significant fraction of the residual emission . to further characterize the properties of the potential foreground emission sources , we need to specify their physical location , i.e .",
    ", whether they reside in the interstellar medium ( ism ) or in the solar system .        to give rise to an isotropic emission component , any emitting sources within the solar system must have a spherically symmetric distribution , either centered on the earth , or centered on the sun and located at a sufficiently large distance to appear isotropic when viewed from the earth .",
    "the measured dirbe intensities were independent of zenith distance , ruling out an earth@xmath6centered cloud of particles .",
    "any local emission component must therefore be sun@xmath6centered , a conclusion supported by the limits on the source temperature and distance discussed below .",
    "we will also assume that such a cloud was assembled during , or shortly after , the formation of the solar system ( about @xmath24 = 4.5 billion years ago ) , since it is unlikely that collisions could have produced a spherical distribution of particles after most of the solar system material settled into a disk .    given an emissivity law and the particle temperature @xmath11 , the cloud s distance from the sun , @xmath25 , can be calculated from the energy balance equation :    @xmath26 = 4\\pi a^2 \\sigma t^4\\ c(t)\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the radius of the emitting particles , @xmath12 their effective albedo , @xmath28 is the planck - averaged value of their emissivity , and @xmath29 is the energy density of the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) . assuming an albedo of 0.5 , large particles will attain temperatures of about 235  k at a distance of 1  au from the sun , whereas particles with optical properties similar to interstellar dust particles ( draine & lee 1984 ) will have typical temperatures of @xmath5 350  k. the distance @xmath25 at which a particle attains a temperature @xmath11 can then be written as :    @xmath30^{-{1\\over2}}\\ \\ \\ \\hbox{for dust particles particles ( } n \\hbox{=2)}.\\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at any distance from the sun , the particles will always be heated by the isrf .",
    "this heating source is less important for blackbodies , but gives dust particles a minimum temperature of about 16  k. given the heliocentric distance of the cloud , its 140 or 240 @xmath0 m brightness is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the mass absorption coefficient of the particles at wavelength @xmath33 .",
    "for blackbodies , @xmath34 is wavelength independent and given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 1 - 3 g @xmath37 is the mass density of the radiating particle .",
    "small dust particles will be characterized by a @xmath38 emissivity law and a value of @xmath39 @xmath40 g@xmath4 at @xmath33 = 240 @xmath0 m ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the resulting cloud heliocentric distances ( in au ) and masses are indicated in square brackets in figures 1a and 1b . for blackbodies ,",
    "the masses were calculated for particles with 1 cm radius .",
    "cloud masses scale linearly with particle radius , and also depend on the particle albedo and mass density . for @xmath21=2 dust particles ,",
    "cloud masses only depend on the mass absorption coefficient and albedo .",
    "the figures show that cloud distances range from @xmath5 5 to 170 au for @xmath21 = 0 , ( @xmath41 700 au for @xmath21 = 2 ) , and cloud masses range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 g for @xmath21 = 0 , ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 g for @xmath21 = 2 ) . depending on their origin",
    ", cloud particles could have a higher albedo and a lower mass density than assumed , as has been suggested for kuiper belt particles ( teplitz et al .",
    "1998 ) . at a fixed temperature , namely that required to produce the observed dirbe detections ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , a lower albedo of @xmath46 0.05 will place the dust cloud at a larger distance , _ increasing _ the cloud mass by about a factor of 2 above that given in the figure .",
    "on the other hand , a significantly lower mass density of @xmath5 0.5 @xmath6 1 g @xmath37 , characteristic of icy particles , will _ decrease _ the cloud mass by a factor of @xmath5 3@xmath66 .",
    "these numbers should serve as a guide for the uncertainties in the estimated cloud masses . for comparison , distances and masses of selected _ known _",
    "solar system components are given in table 1 ( leinert 1996 ) .",
    "the limits on the source temperature and distance provide an additional argument that rules out the possibility that a significant part of the dirbe residual emission originates from any ( t@xmath5  300  k ) earth@xmath6centered distribution of particles .",
    "any cloud of particles in the solar system will be subject to various forces and disruptive processes : radiation pressure and solar gravity ; thermal and kinetic sputtering , grain - grain collisions , and collisional drag as the solar system moves through the interstellar medium ; and gravitational perturbations from passing stars .",
    "each one of these processes will tend to erode or disrupt the cloud of particles . in appendix",
    "@xmath12 we examine the lifetime of the cloud against the various interactions with the sun , the ism , and passing stars .",
    "figure 2 shows the \\{@xmath27(cm ) , @xmath25(au ) } parameter space that must be occupied by any interplanetary material that could significantly contribute to the dirbe residual 140 and 240 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "shaded areas represent regions that are either excluded by the temperature limits of the cloud or where the material would be eroded due to the various effects considered in appendix a on time scales shorter than the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "the horizontal lines marked `` high@xmath6 t limit '' and  low@xmath6 t limit \" indicate the heliocentric distances below and above which the particle temperatures fall beyond the values allowed in figure 1a ( particles with an @xmath47 emissivity law ) .",
    "both limits are shifted to larger values of @xmath25 if the cloud consists of dust particles with an @xmath48 emissivity law instead .",
    "however , the figure shows that a cloud of dust particles with radii @xmath49 0.1 cm is unstable against poynting@xmath6robertson ( p@xmath6r ) drag and interactions with the ism . only a cloud consisting of objects larger than @xmath5 1 cm located between @xmath5 5 and 150",
    "au would be stable against local and ism forces .",
    "a cloud with a temperature of 30  k located at 60 au could give rise to _ all _ of the residual isotropic emission observed in the dirbe bands provided its mass is @xmath50a(cm ) g. the distance and temperature of the cloud are similar to those expected for the kuiper belt .",
    "however , the kuiper belt is a disk or ring , and can not produce an isotropic emission component .",
    "solar system components that can produce an isotropic foreground , such as the inner and outer oort clouds , are too distant and their emission is too faint to contribute significantly to the dirbe 140 or 240 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "table 1 is adapted from leinert ( 1996 ) and shows the possible 240 @xmath0 m contributions from known solar system components .",
    "the hypothetical cloud considered above is the last entry in the table , marked `` hypothetical cloud '' .",
    "such hypothetical clouds may have been observationally detected around main sequence stars by the _",
    "iras _ satellite . from detailed statistical analysis of",
    "the _ iras _ survey data of main sequence stars located within @xmath5 25 pc of the sun , aumann ( 1988 ) suggested that the presence of cool shells around a , f , and g stars is the rule , rather than the exception .",
    "further analysis ( aumann & good 1990 ) suggested that typical cloud temperatures are 20 @xmath6 38  k , and cloud radii are 100 @xmath6 150 au , not unlike the properties of the hypothetical cloud required to produce the residual isotropic emission .",
    "the presence of these shells was inferred from the 60 @xmath0 m excess in the colors of these stars , and _ iras _ lacked the spatial resolution to determine the geometry of the cloud . in the following",
    "we show that a spherical cloud at these distances , will be disrupted by collisions , and probably settle into a disk .",
    "the _ iras _ data are therefore probably indicative of cool disks , rather than spherical shells , around these stars .",
    "this has been directly confirmed in some cases ( e.g. @xmath51 pic ) .    adopting cm@xmath6sized objects as the cloud constituent particles , it is easy to show that the hypothetical cloud lifetime against internal collisions is significantly smaller than the age of the solar system .",
    "the collisional lifetime is roughly given by @xmath53 , where @xmath21 is the number density of cloud particles , @xmath54 their relative velocities or internal velocity dispersions , and @xmath1 their geometrical cross section .",
    "the collisional lifetime is therefore proportional to the optical pathlength @xmath55 , and can therefore be related to the residual intensity @xmath56 it is required to produce by :    @xmath57    adopting a cloud distance , @xmath25 , of @xmath58 au , we find that the orbital velocity @xmath59 is @xmath60 km s@xmath4 .",
    "perturbative forces due to other solar system objects will cause particle orbits to cross , so that @xmath61 4 km s@xmath4 . for @xmath62",
    "k , and a shell thickness @xmath63 equal to one@xmath6tenth of the clouds heliocentric distance , the collisional lifetime is @xmath64 yr , considerably smaller than the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "this conclusion is not significantly altered if we adopt different cloud distances or particle sizes within the range of distances allowed in figure 2 .",
    "the internal collisions will grind the cloud particles into finer dust particles , causing them to either spiral into the sun , or settle into a disk@xmath6like configuration .",
    "having ruled out any _ stable isotropic _ cloud as a source of the residual 140 and 240 @xmath0 m emission , we still need to consider the possible existence of a cloud of particles that is continually replenished ( _ as is the main interplanetary dust cloud _ ) as a viable source for the emission .",
    "1b and table 1 show that the inner oort cloud is positioned at the correct distance and has a suitable isotropic geometry and mass for being a potential source of the cloud .",
    "however , the transport of particles from this location to a distance of @xmath5 100 au by p@xmath6r drag will take over 10@xmath65 yr , making any causal relation between the two clouds highly improbable .",
    "other solar system components are even less likely to be the source of the cloud since they are either farther away , or have too little mass .",
    "we therefore conclude that no existing solar system component can possibly replenish the mass loss from a cloud sufficiently massive to produce significant 140 and 240 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the temperature limits discussed above eliminate the possibility that a significant portion of the 240 @xmath0 m emission arises from warm and hot galactic sources such as white or brown dwarfs .",
    "the only significant galactic contribution to the 240 @xmath0 m residual must come from interstellar dust with a temperature @xmath66 30 k , assuming an emissivity index of @xmath23 . by itself , this requirement can be easily met , since the 140 - 240 @xmath0 m color temperature of the residual emission is @xmath516.5 k , which is quite close to the temperature derived for dust associated with h i in the outer galaxy ( sodroski et al .",
    "1997 ; dwek et al .",
    "however , the isotropy of the residual emission suggests that any significant contribution to the 240 @xmath0 m residual emission must come from a large ( radius @xmath67 kpc ) , roughly spherical , shell of material . a smaller , or centrally condensed cloud would produce observable brightness variations of the emission across the sky",
    "it is very likely that stellar radiation pressure or correlated supernova explosions can expel dust into the halo of our galaxy ( ferrara , ferrini , franco , & barsella 1991 ) .",
    "however , the expelled dust is likely to be patchy and associated with galactic fountains , chimneys , or clusters of ob stars , and therefore not likely to give rise to an isotropic emission component .",
    "furthermore , the required mass of expelled dust is too high to be of galactic origin .",
    "if the entire 240 @xmath0 m residual intensity is assumed to arise from a galactic dust shell , then its mass is @xmath68 @xmath69 ( see eq .",
    "4 ) , where @xmath70 is the radius of the shell in kpc . adopting a radius of 15 kpc , yields a total mass of @xmath71 m@xmath72 of dust and @xmath73 m@xmath72 of gas ( assuming a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath74 = 0.007 ) .",
    "this mass of gas is nearly as large as the mass of the gas in the disk of the galaxy ( e.g. , sodroski et al 1997 ) .",
    "this large gas mass suggests that it is very unlikely that the residual arises from an unmodelled galactic ism component .",
    "the dust required to produce an isotropic galactic background component exhibits very similar characteristics to the dust tentatively detected by zaritsky ( 1994 ) to be present in the halo of the galaxies ngc 2835 and ngc 3521 . at a distance of 15 kpc , the mass surface density of the hypothetical galactic dust shell must be about 10@xmath75 g cm@xmath3 , giving a visual optical depth of @xmath5 0.05 for a galactic extinction law .",
    "such a halo of dust particles will produce a @xmath77 color excess of about 0.07 , similar to the extinction observed by zaritsky ( 1994 ) through the halo of the two galaxies at a distance of 60 kpc from their center .",
    "these observations are taken as preliminary evidence that galactic halos may be dusty even at those radii . however , the extinction observed by zaritsky was along the major axis of these galaxies , and can therefore be only considered as evidence for the presence of dust in an extended disk .",
    "the mass of dust required to be in the disk and to produce the observed color excess will therefore be significantly less than the mass of galactic halo dust required to produce the intensity of the isotropic residual ir emission .",
    "the presence of a dusty disk component in our galaxy , with characteristics similar to the two galaxies observed by zaritsky , can therefore not be ruled out ; however , such dust can not produce an isotropic emission component .",
    "we conclude from the considerations of this section that the residual isotropic 140 and 240 @xmath0 m radiation measured by the dirbe and , by inference , the detections measured by the firas as well , are most likely of extragalactic origin .",
    "after the removal of foreground emission , the dirbe instrument detected a positive residual at 100 @xmath0 m with a value of @xmath78 = 21.9@xmath796.1 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 ( paper i ) .",
    "however , this residual emission is not isotropic , a strict requirement for the extragalactic background .",
    "hauser et al . ( 1998 ) therefore claimed a 95% c. l. upper limit of @xmath80 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at this wavelength .",
    "a lower limit of 3.9 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 was derived from _ iras _ galaxy counts ( hacking & soifer 1991 ) .",
    "however , the positive detections at 140 and 240 @xmath0 m can be used to raise the lower limit on the ir intensity that must be present at 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "infrared lines , most notably the [ c ii ] 158 @xmath0 m line , will not contribute significantly to the ebl detected in the dirbe 140 and 240 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "because of the broad dirbe spectral response , even the galactic c@xmath81 line does not contribute significantly to the energy received in the 140 @xmath0 m band ( wright et al .",
    "emission from different redshifts will further reduce the relative line contribution to the in@xmath6band flux , since the line can originate from only a limited range of redshifts whereas no such restriction applies to the continuum .",
    "the ebl detected in the dirbe 140 and 240 @xmath0 m bands most likely consists largely of emission from dust heated by x@xmath6ray , uv , or optical photons , regardless of their origin ( whether stellar or non@xmath6thermal ) . the same physical process that produces the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m continuum emission must contribute to a signal at 100 @xmath0 m as well .",
    "the exact value of this contribution is , of course , model dependent .",
    "however , the steepest possible dropoff from 140 to 100 @xmath0 m is the wien exponential corresponding to the coldest dust spectrum that is consistent with the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m detections .",
    "the coldest dust spectrum is obtained by fitting the dirbe detections with a blackbody modified by a @xmath38 emissivity law .",
    "any more realistic spectrum , consisting of the contribution of emission from dust at different temperatures and redshifts will give rise to a broader spectrum , and an increased 100 @xmath0 m intensity .",
    "a fit to the nominal values of the dirbe detections gives a dust temperature of about 15 k , and a lower limit of @xmath78 = 14 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at 100 @xmath0 m . to assess the statistical significance of any lower limit , we calculated the 100 @xmath0 m intensity for all possible \\{i(140 @xmath0m)@xmath82 , i(240 @xmath0m)@xmath82 } , combinations , assuming partially ( 50% ) correlated errors .",

    "the various models differ most in their predicted 5 @xmath6 60 @xmath0 m intensities .",
    "the @xmath210 model falls especially short in this wavelength region , since ( admittedly ) the authors did not attempt to model the dust emission at these wavelengths .    very obvious in the figure",
    "is the failure of the uv@xmath6optically determined star formation rate to produce the observed ebl at far@xmath6ir wavelengths .",
    "observationaly this should not be too surprising since the most intense star forming regions frequently manifest themselves primarily through their infrared , rather than their uv or optical , emission , as recently illustrated by iso observations of the antennae galaxies ( mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore",
    ", we have already shown that the total integrated ebl intensity predicted by the uvo cosmic sfr was very close to the detected ebl at 0.36@xmath62.2 @xmath0 m and 140@xmath65000 @xmath0 m , leaving no room for any ebl intensity in the @xmath212 m region of the spectrum .",
    "since our template dust spectrum includes significant emission in this spectral wavelength region , the far@xmath6ir intensity predicted by the @xmath205 model must fall significantly below the observations .",
    "the calculated far@xmath6ir intensity can not be increased by simply increasing the fraction of starlight that is reradiated in the model as thermal ir emission .",
    "this will require an increase in the extinction , causing the uv@xmath6optical part of the ebl to fall below the lower limits of pozzetti et al .",
    "it seems clear that the excess ir emission needed to account for the detected ebl requires a star formation activity that escaped detection at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "the existence of optically obscured star forming regions is not only suggested by the discrepancy of the @xmath205 model ebl spectrum and the observations .",
    "figure 8 shows that _ all _ model predictions are 2@xmath1 below the dirbe ebl measurement at 140 @xmath0 m , which is consistent with the somewhat noisier firas determination at this wavelength .",
    "a population of optically@xmath6hidden , dust enshrouded galaxies or star forming regions , may therefore be needed to account for the observed infrared component of the ebl in all models .",
    "we therefore considered various additional star formation histories .",
    "the cosmic sfr predicted by the infall or closed box models of pf95 ( labeled pfi and pfc , respectively , in figure 3 ) offer alternatives to the @xmath205 model , since they a priori predict higher values for the integrated ebl intensity ( see  4 and table 2 ) . since the integrated ebl of the @xmath213 model is significantly larger than that predicted by the @xmath205 model , it can produce the observed infrared ebl with less extinction than the @xmath205 model , whereas the @xmath214 model requires a somewhat larger extinction to reproduce the observations .",
    "we therefore calculated the ebl spectrum using the @xmath213 and @xmath214 star formation rates with @xmath215 values of 0.20 and 0.35 , respectively .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in figure 9 . for comparison",
    ", the figure also presents the results of the @xmath205 model , as well as a schematic presentation of the range of @xmath78 values allowed by the various observational constraints and detections in the form of a shaded band .",
    "the detailed constraints were discussed earlier in section 6.1 and presented in figure 8 . for the purpose of the discussion , we chose to represent the upper limit in the 10 to 100 @xmath0 m region by the value determined from the kmo96 fluctuation analysis , instead of the larger , but more definitive direct dirbe limits ( paper i ) .",
    "the results show that the @xmath214 model gives an acceptable fit to the ebl at @xmath216 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "the discrepancies , the excess at @xmath216 400 @xmath0 m and the deficiency at @xmath5 140 @xmath0 m , can be reduced by adopting a somewhat hotter spectrum for the emerging ir emission .",
    "the @xmath213 model provides a better fit to the ir detections , but overestimates the local uv to near@xmath6ir luminosity density ( see table 2 ) .",
    "however , the local luminosity density predicted by this model can be lowered if a significant fraction of the star formation produces massive stars , that recycle their energy instantaneously back to the ism .",
    "to explore the predictions of such a two@xmath6component star formation scenario in more detail , we constructed a cosmic sfr that consists of the following sum : @xmath217^{20 } \\quad , \\ ] ] where the first term represents the uvo cosmic sfr , and the second term represents an additional star formation rate component that produces massive stars .",
    "the latter component may be responsible for the observed iron enrichment in the intra@xmath6cluster medium ( elbaz , arnaud , & vangioni@xmath6flam ( 1995 ) . by construction",
    ", the functional form of the second component is sharply peaked at the maximum of @xmath218 , @xmath219 = 1 yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath111 , and _",
    "c _ is a normalization constant , adjusted to provide an improved fit to the detected ir background .",
    "figure 3 depicts the behavior of this sfr ( hereafter refered to as @xmath220 ) as a function of redshift , for _ c _ = @xmath221 . to examine the possibility that the cosmic sfr was significantly higher at redshifts above @xmath5 1.5 , as may be implied by the _ iso _",
    "observations of the hdf ( rr97 ) , we constructed an additional two@xmath6component cosmic sfr similar in form to the one given in eq .",
    "in this model ( hereafter designated @xmath222 ) , the first component is equal to @xmath218 , and the second component is equal to @xmath223^{20}$ ] at redshifts @xmath224 , and constant at its peak value at higher redshifts .",
    "the behavior of this sfr is also depicted in figure 3 .",
    "we assume that stars formed by the second component release all their radiative output instantaneously into the ism , where it is totally absorbed by dust .",
    "the contribution of the second components to the luminosity density at various redshifts is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the observed excess ir background emission , over that predicted by the various models shown in figure 8 , requires the rest frame spectra of these dusty , optically opaque , galaxies or star forming regions to peak shortwards of @xmath5 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "we therefore further assume that these opaque sources have a ulirg spectrum , characterized by that of an h  ii region ( fig .",
    "the ebl spectrum predicted by this two@xmath6component sfr is therefore equal to the sum of that predicted by the @xmath205 model plus the cumulative redshifted ir emission arising from the second sfr component .",
    "the resulting ebl spectra predicted by the two two@xmath6component models are shown in figure 9 .",
    "both models provide a significantly improved fit to the ir background compared to _ all _ other model predictions , and by construction , produce the local luminosity density at ir and uv@xmath6optical wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath222 model predicts a somewhat larger ir background above @xmath5 200 @xmath0 m than the @xmath220 model , since a larger fraction of its star formation rate takes place at higher redshifts .",
    "the @xmath220 model requires the luminosity density at @xmath225 1.5 to be higher than that predicted by the @xmath205 model by about @xmath226 l@xmath127 mpc@xmath111 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . if these sources are identified with ulirgs having l @xmath14 10@xmath227 l@xmath127 , then the required number density of such galaxies would be @xmath228 mpc@xmath111 , about 10@xmath144 times higher than that observed in the local universe .",
    "current observations suggest only a mild evolution in the ulirg population up to @xmath229 ( e.g. , ashby et al .",
    "1996 ; see also sanders & mirabel 1996 )",
    ". extrapolated to @xmath230 , this evolutionary trend yields an enhancement in the ulirg number density by a factor of only @xmath231 over the local value .",
    "alternatively , the excess emission could take place in dust@xmath6enshrouded starburst regions in a population of optically faint , but more numerous , galaxies that may have since dispersed their dust and evolved into the more familiar objects seen today .",
    "figure 9 also shows the contribution of several unobscured ",
    "exotic \" sources to the ebl ( bch86 , bch91 ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the contribution of some sources to the ebl can already be ruled out from the dirbe upper limits in the 1.25 to 4.9 @xmath0 m wavelength region .",
    "complete obscuration of these sources by dust would move their spectra horizontally to longer wavelengths , with the location of the peak determined by the absorbing dust temperature . with some modification",
    ", these sources could contribute to the far@xmath6ir spectrum of the ebl .",
    "the possibility that some exotic and non@xmath6nuclear energy sources may contribute to the ebl , and the fact that the @xmath220 and @xmath222 star formation histories produce similar ir background spectra shows that there is no unique way to account for the ebl spectrum . the current ambiguity in the magnitude and evolution of the cosmic star formation rate",
    "can only be resolved by future measurements of high@xmath232 systems at infrared wavelengths .",
    "in this paper we examined some cosmological implications of the dirbe and firas detections of the ebl at wavelengths between 140 to 5000 @xmath0 m .",
    "we first showed that the residual isotropic infrared background is not likely to arise from local sources in the solar system or in the galaxy (  2 ) .",
    "the dirbe 140 and 240 @xmath0 m and firas 125@xmath65000 @xmath0 m residuals are therefore of extragalactic origin .",
    "assuming that the 140 and 240 background radiation arises from dust emission , we used the measured intensities to derive a lower limit of 5 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 for the extragalactic contribution at 100 @xmath0 m .    the integrated ebl intensity detected by _",
    "cobe _ in the 140 @xmath6 1000 @xmath0 m wavelength region is @xmath5 16 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 .",
    "this intensity is consistent with the energy release expected from nuclear energy sources , and constitutes about 20@xmath650% of the total energy released in the formation of he and metals throughout the history of the universe , the range reflecting various cosmic star formation histories considered in  4 .",
    "galaxy number counts provide a lower limit of 12 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 on the ebl intensity in the 0.36 to 2.2 @xmath0 m wavelength interval .",
    "the explored regions of the ebl account therefore for a total intensity in excess of 28 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 . attributed only to nuclear sources",
    ", this intensity implies that more than @xmath510% of the baryonic mass density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis analysis has been processed in stars to he and heavier elements .",
    "we examined the constraints set by the total intensity of the ebl detected by the _",
    "cobe _ on the cosmological star formation rate ( sfr ) , in particular , on the recently published rate compiled by mpd97 from uv and optical ( uvo ) observations .",
    "the ebl intensity predicted by this cosmic sfr is about 30 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 , comparable to the ebl intensity in the 0.36@xmath62.2 @xmath0 m and 140@xmath65000 @xmath0 m wavelength regions .",
    "this leaves no room for any expected ebl in the @xmath5 2 @xmath6 140 @xmath0 m wavelength interval .",
    "this suggests that the uvo cosmic sfr missed a significant fraction of the cosmic star formation activity that takes place in dust@xmath6enshrouded galaxies or star forming regions .",
    "we constructed a detailed model for calculating the spectrum of the ebl using a hybrid of forward , backward , and cosmic chemical evolution models .",
    "we calculated the ebl spectrum predicted for the uvo cosmic sfr , and compared this spectrum , as well as those predicted by other selected models , to the observational constraints ( figure 8) .",
    "the ir background predicted by the uvo star formation rate falls considerably short of the _ cobe _ detections .",
    "we therefore examined various alternative cosmic star formation histories .",
    "in particular we constructed a two@xmath6component cosmic sfr consisting of the uvo star formation rate plus an additional component representing the star formation activity that might be going on in dust enshrouded galaxies or star forming regions .",
    "two such models , characterized by different behavior of the excess star formation activity at high redshifts were considered ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the ebl spectra predicted by these two models are very similar , and provide significantly better fits to the nominal _ cobe _ detections ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the excess stellar energy must be generated mainly by massive stars which may be the source of the observed metal enrichment of the intra@xmath6cluster medium .",
    "although there is currently no compelling need to invoke non@xmath6nuclear energy sources to explain the _ cobe _ data , their potential contribution to the observed ebl can not be ruled out .",
    "however , the magnitude and spectral shape of any such proposed contribution must now be consistent with the _ cobe _ upper limits and detections .",
    "their contribution , as well as the nucleosynthetic contribution to the ebl , can not be unambiguously determined from the _ cobe _ data alone , and must await the results of future observations that will resolve the sources of the ebl .",

    "in the following we examine the lifetime of a hypothetical cloud of particles in the solar system , with properties constrained to produce an isotropic far@xmath6ir emission component comparable to the observed dirbe residuals , against various disruptive processes in the solar system and the ism .",
    "a similar study was conducted by stern ( 1990 ) , who considered the physical interaction between the ism and the oort cloud . to set strict upper limits on the stability of this hypothetical cloud",
    "we will assume that it consists of refractory particles with a mass density @xmath233 = 3 g @xmath37 .",
    "interactions with charged constituents of the ism are clearly important if the particle cloud is located outside the heliosphere , the cavity carved out from the ism by the solar wind .",
    "the radius of this cavity is determined by the distance at which the magnetic pressure of the solar wind equals that of the ism , and could be anywhere between 50 and 150 au ( holtzer 1989 ) .",
    "we will assume that interactions with the ism can also take place within the heliosphere , since the ulysses spacecraft has detected a flux of interstellar dust particles in the solar system ( grn et al .",
    "1994 ) , and neutral atoms can penetrate the heliosphere in a similar fashion .",
    "the solar system moves at a velocity @xmath234 20 km s@xmath4 relative to the ism gas ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "this motion will take the solar system through various ism phases characterized by different densities ( @xmath21 ) , temperatures ( @xmath11 ) , and filling factors ( @xmath235 ) : the hot ionized medium ( him ) characterized by \\{@xmath236 } = \\{0.005 @xmath37 , 10@xmath237 k , 0.2@xmath60.6 } ; the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) characterized by \\{@xmath238 } = \\{0.26 @xmath37 , 8000 k , @xmath5 0.3 } ; and the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) characterized by \\{@xmath239 } = \\{40 @xmath37 , 50 k , @xmath5 0.02}. the average ism density traversed by the solar system is therefore @xmath240 1 @xmath37",
    ".    thermal sputtering will be most important when the solar system passes through the him .",
    "the sputtering lifetime of a refractory dust particle of radius @xmath27 embedded in a gas of number density @xmath21 and temperature t @xmath241 k is ( dwek , foster , & vancura 1996 ) :      adopting a him filling factor of 0.4 , the solar system has spent a total of @xmath5 1.8@xmath243 yr in the him .",
    "any dust particles with radii @xmath49 1.8 @xmath0 m would therefore have been eroded away by thermal sputtering during this time period .        where we used @xmath245 g @xmath37 for the average density of a particle , and @xmath246 1.4 as the mean molecular weight ( in amu ) of the ism gas .",
    "dust particles with radii @xmath247 cm will therefore be lost from the cloud by collisional drag with the ism on a timescale @xmath248 .",
    "kinetic sputtering is important when dust particles move at suprathermal speed through the ism .",
    "the timescale for destruction by kinetic sputtering following a collision with ism gas atoms with number density @xmath249 and mass @xmath250 is      where @xmath252 is the atomic mass of a sputtered particle , and @xmath253 is the sputtering yield ( defined as the number of ejected particles per incident projectile ) at energy @xmath254 . at velocities of 20 km",
    "s@xmath4 , h , he , and c atoms will impinge on the cloud particles with kinetic energies of 2 , 8 , and 24 ev , respectively .",
    "comparison of the drag and kinetic sputtering timescales gives :      sputtering thresholds range from @xmath5 5 to 8 ev for the most common refractory material , so that only sputtering by he or c atoms will be important , giving @xmath256/@xmath257 1 . furthermore , close to the sputtering threshold , @xmath258 .",
    "consequently , cloud disruption by kinetic sputtering can be neglected compared to its erosion by collisional drag .",
    "evaporative collisions with interstellar grains are not an important destruction process for the cloud particles .",
    "laboratory experiments on collisions between refractory rocks ( okeefe & ahrens 1982 ) show that complete vaporization occurred only when the kinetic energy per projectile atom exceeded the material binding energy ( typically 5 - 8 ev ) by factors @xmath41 5 .",
    "these correspond to impact velocities @xmath41 30 km s@xmath4 , well above the relative velocity of the solar system particle cloud with the ism .",
    "however , the slow and continuous erosion of the cloud particles by cratering collisions proceeds at much lower impact velocities , and can be an important destruction process .",
    "following borkowski & dwek ( 1995 ) we write the erosion rate due to cratering collisions as :      where @xmath260 is the number density of interstellar dust grains ( i.e. projectiles ) of mass @xmath261 , @xmath250 is the mass of an individual atom in the target material , and @xmath262 is a dimensionless cratering yield , where @xmath263 is the specific energy for the ejection of one atom in a cratering event , typically @xmath5 1 ev . the product @xmath264 is thus equal to the total mass excavated in the cratering event , and the validity of the expression requires it to be significantly less than @xmath114 , the mass of the target grain . the timescale for particle erosion by cratering collisions is simply given by @xmath265 :      where we used the relation : @xmath267 , with @xmath268 as the dust to gas mass ratio in the ism , @xmath269 , and @xmath263 = 1 ev . equation ( 9 ) is valid only for particles with @xmath270 , or @xmath271 4 @xmath0 m , where we adopted a grain radius of @xmath5 1 @xmath0 m for the largest interstellar dust particles . hence cloud particles with sizes less than @xmath5 0.07 cm",
    "will be eroded by cratering collisions with interstellar dust particles .",
    "particles within the heliosphere will also be subjected to local forces caused by the sun s gravity , its radiation and the solar wind .",
    "depending on the optical properties , mass , and heliocentric distance of the particles , they can spiral into the sun , be blown out of the solar system , or remain unaffected by the combined effect of these forces .",
    "the absorption and reradiation of sunlight by the orbiting particles gives rise to a poynting@xmath6robertson ( p@xmath6r ) drag .",
    "the decay time for heliocentric orbits of radius @xmath25 as a result of the p@xmath6r drag is given by burns , lamy , & soter ( 1979 ; hereafter bls79 ) : @xmath272    where @xmath273 is the solar bolometric flux at distance @xmath25 , and @xmath274 is the solar@xmath6spectrum@xmath6averaged radiation pressure efficiency factor of the particle ( see below ) .",
    "a lower limit on the radius of the particles that will survive the p@xmath6r effect can be obtained by adopting a large heliopause radius of 150 au . at this distance the critical radius above which particles will maintain a stable orbit over the lifetime of the solar system is given by @xmath275 .",
    "radiation pressure can also expel particles from the solar system , if it overcomes the sun s gravitational attraction .",
    "following bls79 , we define the parameter @xmath51 as the ratio between the two forces :      particles with @xmath277 1/2 can escape the solar system ( bls79 ) .",
    "grains with radii of @xmath278 can therefore be expelled from the solar system by radiation pressure .",
    "these radii are smaller than @xmath279 , so particles that are stable against the p@xmath6r effect are also stable against expulsion from the solar system by radiation pressure",

    "<S> a direct measurement of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) can provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation , metal and dust production , and the conversion of starlight into infrared emission by dust . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine the cosmological implications of the recent detection of the ebl in the 125 to 5000 @xmath0 m wavelength region by the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) and far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) on board the _ cosmic background explorer _ </S>",

    "<S> we first show that the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m isotropic residual emission found in the dirbe data can not be produced by foreground emission sources in the solar system or the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the dirbe 140 and 240 @xmath0 m isotropic residuals , and by inference the firas residuals as well , are therefore extragalactic . assuming that most of the 140 and 240 @xmath0 m emission is from dust yields a 2@xmath1 lower limit of @xmath2 5 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 for the ebl at 100 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated ebl detected by the _ cobe _ between 140 and 5000 @xmath0 m is @xmath5 16 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 , roughly 20@xmath650% of the integrated ebl intensity expected from energy release by nucleosynthesis throughout cosmic history . </S>",
    "<S> this also implies that at least @xmath5 5@xmath615% of the baryonic mass density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis has been cycled through stars . </S>",
    "<S> the _ cobe _ </S>",
    "<S> observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate , and we calculate the ebl spectrum for various star formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the uv and optically determined cosmic star formation rates fall short in producing the observed 140 to 5000 @xmath0 m background . </S>",
    "<S> the _ cobe _ </S>",
    "<S> observations require the star formation rate at redshifts of @xmath7 to be larger than that inferred from uv@xmath6optical observations by at least a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this excess stellar energy must be mainly generated by massive stars , since it otherwise would result in a local luminosity density that is significantly larger than observed . </S>",
    "<S> the energy sources could either be yet undetected dust@xmath6enshrouded galaxies , or extremely dusty star@xmath6forming regions in observed galaxies , and they may be responsible for the observed iron enrichment in the intra@xmath6cluster medium . </S>",
    "<S> the exact star formation history or scenarios required to produce the ebl at far@xmath6ir wavelengths can not be unambiguously resolved by the _ </S>",
