    "the interiors of jupiter and saturn , extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) , and brown dwarfs ( bds ) are all described by similar physics : these bodies are mainly composed of liquid metallic hydrogen , and their interior energy transport mainly occurs through efficient convection @xcite , leading to largely isentropic interiors .",
    "jupiter and saturn , whose radius , mass , luminosity , and age are known precisely , can serve as calibrators of thermal - history calculations for the entire class of objects .",
    "they can provide a test of the adequacy of the diverse physical models , including interior thermodynamics , heat transport mechanisms , and model - atmosphere grid , that enter into the general thermal - history theory for egps and bds .",
    "however , at very low effective temperatures ( @xmath2  100 k ) , the corresponding interior temperatures may become low enough for phase separation of abundant interior components to occur , and this effect must be quantitatively evaluated before jupiter and saturn can be used as calibrators .",
    "this work provides a quantitative assessment of inhomogeneous evolution in jupiter , saturn , and low - mass egps .",
    "relevant calculations and data for jupiter and saturn follow :    * saturn is currently over 50% more luminous than one would predict with a homogeneous , adiabatic cooling model .",
    "saturn models reach the planet s known @xmath1 of 95.0 k in only 2.0 to 2.5 gyr @xcite . * for jupiter , homogeneous , adiabatic cooling models allow jupiter to reach its known @xmath1 of 124.4 k in @xmath2  4.7 gyr .",
    "this is a good match . * the atmospheres of both jupiter and saturn",

    "is 0.231 @xcite and for saturn is likely 0.18 - 0.25 @xcite , but is poorly constrained .",
    "under extreme pressure dense molecular hydrogen dissociates and ionizes to become liquid metallic hydrogen .",
    "the transition is likely continuous over a pressure of 1 - 5 mbar at the temperatures of interest ( @xmath4 k ) in giant planets . also at these temperatures , helium , which makes up about",
    "8% of the atoms in a solar composition mixture , likely becomes immiscible in liquid metallic hydrogen @xcite .",

    "the upper boundary of the horizontally - hatched region shows the minimum temperature at which he is fully miscible in metallic hydrogen with a mass fraction @xmath5 , while the lower boundary shows the minimum temperature corresponding to @xmath6 , according to hdw @xcite theory .",

    "liquid metallic hydrogen ( h@xmath7 ) , liquid molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath8 ) , and the maximum pressures and temperatures reached by laser shock data are also shown .",
    "[ figure : p1 ] ]    detailed calculations on the dynamics and distribution of helium in giant planets have been performed @xcite .",
    "these authors found that when helium becomes immiscible in liquid metallic hydrogen , the composition that separates out is essentially pure helium , and this helium on fairly short timescales ( relative to the convective timescale ) will coalesce to form helium droplets .",
    "these droplets , being denser than the surrounding liquid metallic hydrogen , will fall through the planet s gravitational field .",
    "if the droplets reach a region where helium is again miscible at higher concentration , they will redissolve , enriching the deeper regions of the planet in helium .",
    "helium would be lost from @xmath9 regions with pressures lower than the pressures in the immiscibility region , since the planet is fully convective up to the atmosphere .",
    "excess helium would be mixed down to the immiscibility region and be lost to deeper layers .",
    "this `` helium rain '' could be a substantial additional energy source for giant planets .",
    "we find that the calculated phase diagram of hdw @xcite , which is essentially equivalent to that of stevenson @xcite , are inapplicable to the interiors of giant planets , if helium phase separation is saturn s only additional energy source . as shows ,",
    "this phase diagram prolongs saturn s cooling 0.8 gyr , even in the most favorable circumstance that all energy liberated is available to be radiated , and does not instead go into heating the planet s deep interior . as we show in our published work @xcite , we find that a modified version of the phase diagram of pfaffenzeller et al .",
    "@xcite , with a higher temperature for the onset of helium immiscibility ( see figure  [ figure : p1 ] ) , allows saturn to reach its known @xmath1 and age , while jupiter evolves homogeneously until @xmath10 5 gyr .",
    "saturn s @xmath0 falls to 0.185 at 4.5 gyr , which is at the low end of saturn s derived value @xcite .",
    "this modified phase diagram can be applied to various hypothetical giant planets @xcite .",
    "we follow the evolution of planets with masses from 0.15 @xmath12 ( 1/2 saturn s mass ) to 3.0 @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ figure : teff ] shows the evolution of these planets with and without the effects of helium phase separation .",
    "these planets are in isolation and possess 10 @xmath13 cores . at gyr ages",
    "the model planets undergoing phase separation can have @xmath1s 10 - 15 k higher than the homogeneous models , making the planets somewhat easier to detect .     for planets of mass 0.15 to 3.0 @xmath12 for our standard models with no stellar irradiation and 10 @xmath13 cores .",
