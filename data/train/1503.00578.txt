    "the goal of this paper is to give a precise description of the fluctuations of solutions of elliptic equations with random coefficients , in the large scale limit . before stating our precise assumptions and results , we present powerful heuristics that enable to guess the results and give a better comprehension of the phenomena .",

    "the gaussian free field is a high - dimensional version of brownian motion . by analogy with",
    ", we may want to ask a gaussian free field @xmath20 to satisfy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a @xmath9-dimensional white noise .",

    "however , for generic @xmath27 and @xmath11 , the correlation in can not be expressed as a green function . in other words , our definition of ( generalized )",
    "gaussian free field is wider than the standard one .",
    "it is important for the remainder of the discussion to be familiar with the scaling and regularity properties of white noise and gaussian free fields .",
    "as for white noise , @xmath40 has the same law as @xmath41 . in particular , thinking of @xmath42 , we see that zooming in on @xmath22 at scale @xmath43 produces a blow - up of @xmath44 ( and conversely if we think of @xmath45 ) .",

    "we recover the fact that brownian motion trajectories have hlder regularity @xmath46 for every @xmath52 . in higher dimensions",
    ", the gaussian free field fails to have regularity @xmath33 ; it only makes sense as a distribution , but not as a function .",
    "we now turn to the homogenization of the operator @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a random field of symmetric matrices .",
    "we assume that the law of @xmath55 is stationary and posesses very strong mixing properties ( e.g.  finite range of dependence ) , and that @xmath56 for some constant @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", it is well - known that the large scale properties of the operator @xmath53 resemble those of the homogeneous operator @xmath58 , for some constant , deterministic matrix @xmath27 .",
    "our goal is to describe the next - order correction . for @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we introduce @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 ) .",
    "this quantity is subadditive : if @xmath63 is partitioned into subcubes @xmath64 , then @xmath65 is smaller than the average over @xmath66 of @xmath67 .",
    "indeed we can glue the minimizers of @xmath67 and create a minimizer candidate for @xmath65 .",
    "roughly speaking , it was shown in @xcite that homogenization follows from the fact that @xmath68 { } \\frac 1 2 p \\cdot a_{\\mathsf{h}}p\\ ] ] ( which itself is a consequence of the subadditve ergodic theorem ) .",
    "it is natural to expect the next - order correction to homogenization to follow from the understanding of the next - order correction to .",
    "however , the next - order correction to is driven by a boundary layer , which is of order @xmath69 ( see @xcite ) , and is not relevant to the understanding of the interior behavior of solutions .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath70 has been suitably modified into @xmath71 in order to get rid of the boundary layer . after performing this modification",
    ", we expect @xmath72 to be `` almost additive '' @xcite , and therefore that @xmath73 converges to a gaussian random variable as @xmath43 tends to infinity ( as a consequence of the strong mixing assumption on the coefficients ) .",
    "closely related statements were proved in @xcite .",
    "we want to encode this information in a way that is consistent with respect to changing the vector @xmath74 , the scale @xmath43 and translations of the cube . for this purpose , we let @xmath22 be a matrix - valued white noise field such that as @xmath43 becomes large , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spatial average of @xmath22 on scale @xmath43 : @xmath77 ( we may also think of @xmath76 as the convolution of @xmath22 with a rescaled bump function : @xmath78 , with @xmath79 such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 . ) this encodes in particular the fact that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are asymptotically independent if @xmath84 and @xmath85 are disjoint .",
    "recall that each coordinate of @xmath86 is of order @xmath87 .",
    "we interpret as indicating that if a function locally minimizes the energy over @xmath84 and has average gradient @xmath74 , then its energy over @xmath88 is approximately @xmath89 .",
    "the corrector for @xmath90 in the direction @xmath74 is usually defined as the sublinear function solving @xmath91 in the whole space .",
    "we think of @xmath92 as the minimizer in the definition of @xmath93 , for @xmath94 extremely large ( in fact , infinite ) , and focus our attention on understanding the spatial average @xmath95 of @xmath92 on scale @xmath43 , @xmath96 .",
    "the discussion above suggests that @xmath95 minimizes the _ coarsened _ energy function @xmath97 whose euler - lagrange equation is @xmath98 rearranging , we obtain @xmath99 since @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath76 on the left - hand side can be neglected , and we obtain the gaussian - free - field equation @xmath102 we summarize this heuristic computation as follows .",
    "* we let @xmath22 be the matrix - valued white noise field whose covariance is related to the fluctuations of the energy via ; * we let @xmath20 be the random distribution defined by @xmath103 * then the large - scale spatial averages of the corrector @xmath92 have about the same law as those of @xmath20 . in other words ( and by the scale invariance of @xmath20 ) , the random distribution @xmath104 converges in law to @xmath20 in a suitably weak topology , as @xmath43 tends to infinity .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for , say , solutions of equations of the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 varies on scale @xmath107 .",
    "( the function @xmath108 should be of order @xmath109 in order for @xmath110 to be of order @xmath111 . )",
    "we consider the spatial average @xmath112 of @xmath110 over scale @xmath43 , @xmath113 . by the same reasoning as above",
    ", we expect @xmath112 to satisfy the coarsened equation @xmath114 we write @xmath115 , where @xmath116 solves @xmath117 so that @xmath118 as before , we expect the term @xmath76 on the left - hand side to be negligible , so we obtain @xmath119 we stress that if instead we use the formal two - scale expansion @xmath120 and the large - scale description of the corrector in , we are led to a different and _ incorrect _ result .",
    "we can again summarize our conclusions as follows .    1 .",
    "we define the matrix - valued white noise field as above , according to ; 2 .   we let @xmath121 be the random distribution defined by the equation @xmath122 3 .",
    "then the large - scale averages of @xmath123 have about the same law as those of  @xmath121 .",
    "the random distribution @xmath121 is not a ( generalized ) gaussian free field per se because the term @xmath124 appearing in its defining equation varies over large scales .",
    "however , it will have similar small - scale features .",
    "if we normalize @xmath108 so that @xmath116 is of order  @xmath111 , then @xmath124 is of order @xmath125 , over a length scale of order @xmath126 .",
    "hence , we can think of @xmath127 as locally like a ( generalized ) gaussian free field ( of order @xmath111 ) , and being close to @xmath33 outside of a domain of diameter of order @xmath126 .",
    "incidentally , if we make the ( unjustified ) ansatz that @xmath123 is approximately a regularization of @xmath121 on the unit scale ( that is , if we pretend that the conclusion ( 3 ) above actually holds on the unit scale ) , then we recover the ( correct ) error estimate @xmath128    mathematically speaking , a version of the statement that @xmath129 converges to a ( generalized ) gaussian free field was proved in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to prove a version of the conclusion ( 3 ) above .    before turning to this , we want to emphasize why we believe these results to be of practical interest .",
    "homogenization itself is interesting since it enables to describe approximations of solutions of equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients by solutions of simple equations described by a few effective parameters .",
    "what the above arguments show is that the same is true of the next - order correction : in order to describe it , it suffices to know the few parameters describing the covariance of the white noise  @xmath22 .",
    "the white noise @xmath22 takes values in symmetric matrices , so its covariance matrix is fully described by @xmath130 parameters , where @xmath131 ( @xmath132 parameters in dimension @xmath133 , @xmath134 parameters in dimension @xmath135 ) .",
    "naturally , fewer parameters are necessary for problems with additional symmetries .",
    "for instance , the noise is described by only one parameter in any dimension if we assume rotational invariance .",
    "we focus on dimension @xmath135 and higher and on a discrete setting .",
    "our main assumption is that the random coefficients are i.i.d .  and bounded away from @xmath33 and infinity .",
    "our goal is to justify the points ( 1 - 3 ) listed above in this context .    in order to state our assumptions and results more precisely , we introduce some notations .",
    "we work on the graph @xmath136 with @xmath0 , where @xmath137 is the set of nearest - neighbor edges .",
    "let @xmath138 be the canonical basis in @xmath139 .",
    "for every edge @xmath140 , there exists a unique pair @xmath141 such that @xmath142 links @xmath143 to @xmath144",
    ". we will write @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we give ourselves a family of i.i.d .",
