    "nature is characterized by a number of physical laws and fundamental dimensionless couplings , which historically we have assumed to be spacetime - invariant .",
    "for the former this assumption is a cornerstone of the scientific method ( and alternatives are virtually inconceivable ) , but for the latter it is an assumption with no real justification .",
    "there is ample experimental evidence showing that fundamental couplings run with energy , and many particle physics and cosmology models suggest that they should also roll with time .",
    "searching for time variations of fundamental constants ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) is a challenging but powerful probe of fundamental physics , and starts with the identification of laboratory or astrophysical environments that are so clean and well understood that any deviations from the expected behavior can be ascribed to new physics ( as opposed to systematics or other uncertainties ) .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , hereafter ) is one such example .",
    "the astonishing agreement between the current measurements of and the theoretical expectations for cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies has opened the possibility of testing several aspects of fundamental physics in the early universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "cmb anisotropies are sensitive to variations in fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    a time varying fine structure constant can leave an imprint on cmb anisotropies by changing the time of recombination and the size of the acoustic horizon at photon - electron decoupling , and the steadily improving cmb datasets have been extensively used to constrain it . parameterizing a variation in the fine structure constant as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the standard , local",
    ", value and @xmath5 is the value during the recombination process , the authors of @xcite used the first year wmap data , finding the constraint @xmath8 at @xmath9 c.l .",
    "( see also @xcite ) . this constraint was subsequently updated to @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) by combining the third year wmap data with the hubble space telescope key project constraint on the hubble constant .",
    "more recently , using the five observations from the wmap satellite , the authors of @xcite found the constraint @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that a variation in the fine - structure constant is mostly degenerate with a variation in the hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "combining cmb data with independent measurements of @xmath13 can indeed improve the constraint on @xmath5 .    over the past few months substantial improvements",
    "have been reported both in measurements of cmb anisotropies and in the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "the new results from the acbar ( @xcite ) , quad ( @xcite ) and bicep ( @xcite ) experiments , together with the new release of the wmap data from the five - year survey , are now sampling the cmb temperature angular spectrum with great accuracy down to arcminute angular scales and now also provide clear evidence for acoustic oscillations in the polarization channel . moreover , the uncertainty on the hubble constant has been reduced by more than half from the recent analysis of @xcite yielding a new constraint of @xmath14 .    with these new experimental improvements",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate the new constraints on @xmath5 , as we plan to do in this brief report .",
    "our paper is therefore structured as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the data analysis method used while in section iii we present our results .",
    "as we show in the conclusion , the new data provides a significant improvement on the constraint on a time varying @xmath5 .",
    "we include a possible variation in the fine structure constant in the recombination process using the method adopted in @xcite and modifying the publicly available recfast ( @xcite ) routine in the camb ( @xcite ) cmb code .",
    "we constrain variation in the fine structure constant @xmath15 by a cosmomc analysis of the most recent cmb data .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostics done through the gelman and rubin statistics .",
    "we sample the following eigh - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the hubble constant @xmath13 , the scalar spectral index @xmath18 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath19 at @xmath20 mpc@xmath21 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath22 and , finally , the variations in the fine structure constant @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .    our basic data set is the five  year wmap data @xcite , @xcite ( temperature and polarization ) with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team . together with the wmap data we also consider the following cmb datasets : acbar ( @xcite ) , quad ( @xcite ) and bicep ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also include the older datasets from boomerang ( @xcite ) and cbi ( @xcite ) .",
    "for all these experiments we marginalize over a possible contamination from sunyaev - zeldovich component , rescaling the wmap template at the corresponding experimental frequencies . finally , we include the improved constraint on the hubble constant of @xmath23 at @xmath1 c.l .. from the recent analysis of @xcite .",
    "in table [ tab : wdm ] we report the constraints on the @xmath24 parameter obtained from the cosmomc analysis , using the the different combinations of the datasets described in the previous section .",
    ".limits on @xmath15 from wmap data only ( first row ) , from a larger set of cmb experiments ( second row ) , and from cmb plus the hst prior on the hubble constant , @xmath25 ( third row ) .",
    "we report errors at @xmath26 and @xmath27 confidence level . [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly the new cmb data at arcminute angular scales provide a substantial improvement in the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath5 is indeed halved when the data coming from the new quad , bicep and acbar experiments are included in the analysis .",
    "the increase in the precision is mainly due to the effects from modified recombination on the cmb anisotropy damping tail that is more accurately measured by the quad and acbar experiments .    in figure",
    "[ plot ] we show the @xmath1 and @xmath9 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath15 vs the hubble constant for different datasets .",
    "as we can see , a degeneracy is clearly present between the hubble parameter and the fine structure constant . a change in @xmath5 shifts the recombination epoch , affecting the angular diameter distance at recombination and the peak position in the cmb anisotropy angular spectra .",
    "a similar effect can be obtained by changing the value of the hubble constant and the two parameters are therefore degenerate .",
    "including the recent hst measurements of @xmath13 has therefore the important effect of breaking the @xmath5-@xmath13 degeneracy and thereby providing a stronger bound to @xmath24 .",
    "this is clearly shown in the third row of table 1 and , again , in figure [ plot ] .",
    "the best fit parameters for the cmb+hst run are : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , in agreement with the values obtained when @xmath5 is not varied .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath9 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath15 vs the hubble constant for different datasets .",
    "the contour regions come from the wmap-@xmath33 data ( blue ) , all current cmb data ( red ) , and cmb+hst ( green).,width=272 ]    @xmath1 and @xmath9 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath15 vs the age of the universe @xmath34 for different datasets .",
    "the contour regions come from the wmap-@xmath33 data ( blue ) , all current cmb data ( red ) , and cmb+hst ( green).,width=272 ]    since the age of the universe is strongly connected with the hubble constant , we also plot the constraints on the @xmath15 vs age of the universe plane in figure [ plot2 ] . as we can see , including the small scale cmb experiments and the hst prior recover the standard constraint on the age of the universe achieved assuming constant @xmath5 .",
    "we indeed found that if one allows for variations in @xmath5 , the wmap five year data bounds the age of the universe to @xmath35 gyrs ( at @xmath1 c.l . ) , with an increase in the error of a factor @xmath4 respect to the quoted standard constraint ( see @xcite ) .",
    "including all cmb datasets improves the constraint to @xmath36 while combining with the hst prior yields @xmath37 gyrs ( all at @xmath1 c.l .. ) .",
    "we found no relevant degeneracies with the remaining parameters .",
    "in this brief report we have investigated the constraints on variation of the fine structure constant from current cmb observations .",
    "we have updated previous results and investigated in detail the degeneracies present between @xmath5 and the remaining cosmological parameters .",
    "we have found that the combination of the latest cmb data and hst measurement of @xmath13 yield the constraint @xmath38 at @xmath1 c.l . , providing no indications for strong variation in @xmath5 in the early universe .",
    "this constraint improves by a factor @xmath4 previous bounds obtained by past cosmological data analysis . this bound is also competitive with big bang nucleosynthesis bounds ( see e.g. @xcite ) which assume the same cosmological framework , but is based on different physical mechanisms at very different energy scales .",
    "( stronger bbn bounds can be obtained by making specific model - dependent assuptions @xcite . )",
    "further improvements are expected from the planck satellite experiment , which is now collecting data @xcite : it should be able to bound variations in @xmath5 at the @xmath39 level without assuming the hst prior ( for comparison a cosmic variance limited experiment could improve the bound to @xmath40 level ) .",
    "these ever tighter bounds , combined with local measurements using atomic clocks and with forthcoming low - redshift measurements obtained with stable high - resolution spectrographs such as pepsi , espresso or codex , strongly constrain fundamental physics , particularly the dynamics of any cosmological scalar fields .",
