    "the heisenberg spin - glass ( sg ) model , or the edwards - anderson model with the isotropic heisenberg exchange interaction @xcite , has been considered as the standard model of many real sg materials @xcite . in realistic three spatial dimensions ( 3d ) ,",
    "earlier studies in the 80 s suggested that the isotropic heisenberg sg did not exhibit an equilibrium sg transition at any finite temperature in apparent contrast to experiments @xcite .",
    "then , a proposal was made in 1992 that the model might exhibit a finite - temperature transition in the chiral sector , with the standard sg order occurring at a temperature @xmath1 lower than the chiral - glass ( cg ) ordering temperature @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of such separate spin and chirality transitions is now called `` spin - chirality decoupling '' @xcite .",
    "chirality is a multispin variable representing the sense or the handedness of local noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration .",
    "a possible counter - view to such a picture might be that the spin and the chirality order at a common finite temperature @xcite . although there is no complete consensus , recent simulations point to the occurrence of the spin - chirality decoupling in 3d @xcite .",
    "for example , ref.@xcite reported that @xmath1 was lower than @xmath2 by about @xmath4% .    to get further insight into the issue",
    ", it might be useful to extend the space dimension from original @xmath5 to general @xmath6-dimensions . in @xmath7 , the heisenberg sg with a short - range ( sr ) interaction exhibits only a @xmath8 transition . in @xmath9",
    ", recent calculations suggested that the vector sg model , either the three - component heisenberg sg @xcite or the two - component _ xy _ sg @xcite , exhibited a @xmath8 transition but with the spin - chirality decoupling , _",
    "i.e. _ , the cg correlation - length exponent @xmath10 was greater than the sg correlation - length exponent @xmath11 , meaning that this @xmath8 transition was characterized by two distinct diverging length scales , each associated with the chirality and with the spin . in the opposite limit of @xmath12 ,",
    "the model is known to reduce to the mean - field ( mf ) model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model .",
    "the heisenberg sk model is known to exhibit a single finite - temperature transition , with no spin - chirality decoupling . in high but finite @xmath6 ,",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) study by imagawa and kawamura suggested that the spin - chirality decoupling did not occur for @xmath13 , whereas the situation in @xmath14 appeared somewhat more marginal @xcite .    another useful way of attacking the issue might be to study the one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg sg with a long - range ( lr ) power - law interaction proportional to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 the spin distance ) .",
    "indeed , several studies both for the ising and the heisenberg sgs suggested that the 1d lr sg model with a power - law exponent @xmath17 might show the ordering behavior analogous to the @xmath6-dimensional sg model with a sr interaction @xcite .",
    "even a simple empirical formula relating @xmath17 and @xmath6 , @xmath18 , was proposed @xcite , though the relation is only approximate",
    ".    recent mc calculation on the 1d lr heisenberg sg by viet and kawamura suggested that the spin - chirality decoupling occurred for @xmath19 , but did not occur for @xmath20 , @xmath21 being estimated numerically to be @xmath22 @xcite . if one applies the approximate @xmath23 correspondence formula quoted above @xcite , the critical dimension below which the spin - chirality decoupling is expected would be @xmath24 , suggesting that @xmath14 might lie near the margin of , slightly on the side of the spin - chirality coupling regime",
    "of course , the above @xmath23 correspondence formula is only approximate , and even whether @xmath14 is greater or smaller than @xmath25 is not clear . previous simulation on the @xmath26 heisenberg sg , which dealt with the linear size of @xmath27 , was not definitive concerning the occurrence of the spin - chirality decoupling in 4d @xcite .    under such circumstances , the purpose of the present paper is first to clarify whether the spin and the chirality are decoupled or not in the @xmath26 heisenberg sg by simulating larger systems than the ones studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "since @xmath14 is expected to be close to the marginal dimension concerning the spin - chirality decoupling , we wish to see what kind of ordering behavior is realized for the spin and the chirality near the marginal dimension .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we introduce our model and explain some of the details of our mc simulation .",
    "various physical quantities are defined in  iii .",
    "the results of our mc simulations , including the spin and the chiral correlation lengths , the spin and the chiral binder ratios , are presented in",

    "as mentioned in  1 , possible correspondence between the orderings of the @xmath6-dimensional sr heisenberg sg and of the 1d lr heisenberg sg with a power - law interaction has been suggested in the literature .",
    "although this correspondence is by no means exact , recent numerical studies both on the ising and the heisenberg sgs supported such correspondence .",
    "indeed , katzgraber _ et al _ proposed a formula for the @xmath6-@xmath17 correspondence , a refined version of the one mentioned in  1 @xcite , @xmath168 where @xmath163 is the spin anomalous - dimension exponent of the @xmath6-dimensional sr system .",
    "now , we have an estimate of @xmath163 for the @xmath14 heisenberg sg as @xmath169 . substituting this into the r.h.s . of eq.(17 ) and putting @xmath14 , we get @xmath170 . together with the recent numerical estimate of the borderline value of @xmath21 separating the spin - chirality coupling / decoupling regimes ,",
    "@xmath22 @xcite , the @xmath6-@xmath17 correspondence suggests that the 4d lies very close to the borderline dimensionality of the spin - chirality coupling / decoupling , on the coupling regime only slightly .",
    "such a view on the basis of the @xmath6-@xmath17 correspondence seems fully consistent with our present mc results .",
    "in fact , the correspondence holds also for the critical exponents . in the @xmath6-@xmath17 analogy",
    ", the exponent @xmath11 of the 1d lr model should be related to that of the @xmath6-dimensional sr model via the relation , @xmath11[1d - lr]=@xmath171[@xmath6d - sr ] @xcite .",
    "then , our 4d result suggests that the corresponding 1d lr model should be characterized by the exponent @xmath172 .",
    "meanwhile , ref.@xcite gave @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath175 so that the expected relation is indeed satisfied .",
    "all these results suggest that @xmath14 probably lies fairly close to the borderline dimensionality of the spin - chirality decoupling / coupling , may even lie just at the border .",
    "the authors are thankful to t. okubo and t. obuchi for useful discussion .",
