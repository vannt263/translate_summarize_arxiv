    "_ nakano spaces _ are a generalisation of @xmath2 function spaces in which the exponent @xmath3 is allowed to vary as a measurable function of the underlying measure space . the phd thesis of pedro poitevin @xcite studies nakano spaces as banach lattices from a model theoretic standpoint .",
    "more specifically , he viewed nakano spaces as continuous metric structures ( in the sense of continuous logic , see @xcite ) in the language of banach lattices , possibly augmented by a predicate symbol @xmath4 for the modular functional , showed that natural classes of such structures are elementary in the sense of continuous first order logic , and studied properties of their theories .    in the present paper we propose to answer a few questions left open by poitevin .    * first , poitevin studies nakano spaces in two natural languages : that of banach lattices , and the same augmented with an additional predicate symbol for the modular functional",
    ". it is natural to ask whether these languages are truly distinct , i.e. , whether adding the modular functional adds new structure .",
    "* even if the naming of the modular functional does not add structure , it does give quantifier elimination in atomless nakano spaces . while it is clear that without it quantifier elimination is impossible , it is natural to ask whether model completeness is .",
    "* poitevin showed that the theory of atomless nakano space where the exponent function is _ bounded away from one _ is stable .",
    "what about the general case ?",
    "* similarly , if the exponent is constant , i.e. , if we are dealing with classical atomless @xmath2 spaces , it is known ( see @xcite ) that the theory of these spaces is @xmath0-categorical and @xmath0-stable . on the other hand , it is quite easy to verify complete theories of atomless nakano spaces are non @xmath0-categorical and non @xmath0-stable once the essential range of the exponent is infinite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether , up to small perturbations of the exponent , a complete theory of atomless nakano spaces is @xmath0-categorical and @xmath0-stable .",
    "a positive answer would mean that the theory of atomless nakano spaces is stable settling the previous item as well .    in this paper",
    "we answer all of these questions positively ( where a negative answer to the first question is considered positive ) .",
    "it is organised as follows :    consist purely of functional analysis , and requires no familiarity with model theory .",
    "after a few general definitions we study mappings between vector lattices of measurable functions and then more specifically between nakano spaces .",
    "our main result is :    let @xmath5 be a banach lattice isometric embedding of nakano spaces of dimension at least two . then up to a measure density change on @xmath6 and identification between subsets of @xmath7 and of @xmath6 ( and thus between measurable functions on @xmath7 and on @xmath6 ) @xmath8 is merely an extension by zeros from @xmath7 to @xmath9 . in particular @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it follows that such embeddings respect the modular functional and extend the essential range of the exponent function .    in we",
    "expose the model theoretic setting for the paper .",
    "in particular , we quote the main results of poitevin s phd thesis @xcite .    in",
    "we prove our main model theoretic results :    the modular functional is definable in every nakano banach lattice ( i.e. , naming it in the language does not add structure ) .",
    "moreover , it is uniformly definable in the class of nakano spaces of dimension at least two , and in fact both @xmath12-definable and @xmath13-definable there .",
    "the theory of atomless nakano spaces with a fixed essential range for the exponent function is model complete in the banach lattice language .    in",
    "we study perturbations of the exponent function , showing that small perturbations thereof yield small perturbations of the structures . up to such perturbations",
    "the theory of atomless nakano spaces is @xmath0-stable , and every completion thereof is @xmath0-categorical .",
    "in particular all nakano space are stable .",
    "consist of the adaptation to continuous logic of a few classical model theoretic results and tools used in this paper .",
    "finally , contains some approximation results for the modular functional which were used in earlier versions of this paper to be superseded later by , but which nonetheless might be useful .",

    "( since we wish to consider function spaces as banach lattices it will be easier to consider the case of real - valued functions . )",

    "it is a banach lattice .    in the literature",
    "@xmath26 is usually merely referred to as the _ modular_. being particularly sensitive regarding parts of speech we shall nonetheless refer to it throughout as the modular _ functional_.      in this paper we shall consider the class of nakano spaces from a model - theoretic point of view .",
    "this means we shall have to admit arbitrarily large nakano spaces ( e.g. , @xmath27-saturated for arbitrarily big @xmath27 ) and therefore arbitrarily large measure spaces . in particular , we can not restrict our attention to @xmath28-finite measure spaces . in order to avoid pathologies which may arise with arbitrary measure spaces we shall require a weaker assumption .",
    "recall from @xcite :    a measure space @xmath14 is _ strictly localisable _ if it can be expressed as a disjoint union of measure spaces of finite measure , i.e. , if @xmath7 admits a partition as @xmath29 such that :    1 .   for all @xmath30 : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "we also have an obvious mapping @xmath41 .",
    "this does not lose any information that interests us : in particular , @xmath8 restricts to an isometric isomorphism of nakano spaces @xmath42 .",
    "we may therefore allow ourselves :    [ conv : strloc ] in this paper every measure space is assumed to be strictly localisable .",
    "let us state a few very easy facts concerning strictly localisable measure spaces .",
    "the following is immediate :    [ fct : witnessrefinement ] let @xmath43 witness that @xmath14 is strictly localisable .",
    "if @xmath44 is another partition of @xmath7 refining @xmath45 , splitting each @xmath46 into at most countably many subsets , then @xmath47 is a witness as well .    the radon - nikodm theorem is classically stated for finite measure spaces , with various occurrences in the literature in which the finiteness requirement on the ambient space is relaxed .",
