    "the strong and long - range interaction between rydberg excited atoms  @xcite is suitable for creating magnetic phases with long - range order  @xcite , and can give rise to the rydberg blockade that suppress resonant optical excitation of multiple rydberg atoms  @xcite . the rydberg blockade",
    "offers many possibilities for realization of the neutral - atom - based quantum information processing  ( qip ) tasks  @xcite and for observing the multi - atom effects  @xcite .",
    "recently , the blockade effect between a single rydberg - excited atom and a second one located about 10 @xmath0 m and 4 @xmath0 m away have been observed in experiments  @xcite , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , when the strength of the rydberg interaction is under the intermediate regime , i.e. , too weak to yield the blockade , yet too strong to be ignored , the atoms could be pumped to rydberg excited states simultaneously . in this case , the rydberg - interaction - based controlled - phase gate has been studied theoretically  @xcite . besides , if the rydberg interaction strength meets some certain conditions with the detuning of the driving laser fields , it could also be used to resonantly pump the ground state to the two - excitation state of two rydberg atoms .",
    "this rydberg pumping process has theoretically been studied and used for preparation of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "it has traditionally been considered that the dissipation only has negative effect on performance of qip tasks . however , with the development of quantum information technology , researchers had a better insight on the roles of dissipation . in 1999 , plenio _",

    "et al_. first proposed schemes to prepare entanglement via dissipation  @xcite . immediately afterwards , several schemes were suggested to study the entanglement in dissipative quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "these works have opened new chapters for the dissipative - dynamics - based schemes  @xcite . compared with the unitary - dynamics - based schemes for entanglement preparation , the chief features of these dissipative - dynamics - based ones are that the desired state can be achieved without requirement of setting specific initial state and controlling evolution time accurately .",
    "schemes that combine dissipative dynamics and rydberg interactions are interesting since the advantages of dissipation and that of rydberg atom are integrated together  @xcite .",
    "in particular , carr and saffman proposed a scheme for preparation of two - atom bell singlet state with rydberg state mediated interaction via dissipation  @xcite . in contrast with the rydberg blockade based schemes that accommodate at most one atom shared rydberg excitation , the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite utilizes the rydberg pumping process as well as the microwave field to drive the undesired states in the ground state subspace to that in two - excitation subspace which would decay to the desired state in ground state subspace via dissipation with a certain probability",
    ". however , to prevent the pumping process from the desired state to the two - excitation state , asymmetric rydberg coupling strengths are required .",
    "the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite was extended to prepare three - dimensional entanglement in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which three rydberg excited states in each atom are required and thus nine rydberg interactions would be produced .",
    "nevertheless , similar to the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , asymmetric rydberg coupling strengths are also necessary since three out of the nine rydberg interactions are undesirable .    in this paper , getting inspirations from ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose a simplified scheme for preparation of two - atom entanglement by dissipative rydberg pumping .",
    "our scheme has the following characteristics : ( i ) only one rydberg - rydberg interaction term is produced and thus the asymmetric rydberg coupling strengths are avoided .",
    "( ii ) numerical simulations show that the fidelity @xmath1 = 0.999 could be achieved .",
    "( iii ) the physical thought is exteded to prepare three - dimensional entanglement through adding one rydberg - rydberg interaction without requirement of asymmetry rydberg interactions . compared with the unitary - dynamics - based schemes ,",
    "the present one has the benefits such as the desired entanglement could be prepared without requirement of setting initial state and controlling evolution time accurately .",
    "the organization of the rest paper is as follows : in sec .  [",
    "s2 ] , we propose the scheme to prepare two - atom maximal entanglement and assess the performance through calculating the fidelity and clauser - horne - shimony - holt correlation numerically . in sec .",

    "the transition @xmath5 is driven by the classical optical laser with rabi frequency @xmath6 and detuning @xmath7 . the resonant coupling between ground states @xmath2 and @xmath3 is realized by microwave field or raman transition with rabi frequency @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the strength of the rydberg interaction which mainly depends on the principal quantum numbers of the rydberg atom and the distance between the rydberg atoms . here , we assume the excited state can spontaneously decay into two ground states with branching ratio @xmath10 .",

    "<S> inspired by recent work [ a. w. carr and m. saffman , phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . lett . * 111 * , 033607 ( 2013 ) ] , we propose a simplified scheme to prepare the two - atom maximally entangled states via dissipative rydberg pumping . compared with the former scheme , the simplified one involves less classical laser fields and rydberg interactions , and the asymmetric rydberg interactions are avoided . </S>",
    "<S> master equation simulations demonstrate that the fidelity and the clauser - horne - shimony - holt correlation of the maximally entangled state could reach up to 0.999 and 2.821 , respectively , under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extend the physical thoughts to prepare the three - dimensional entangled state , the numerical simulations show that , in theory , both the fidelity and the negativity of the desired entanglement could be very close to unity under certain conditions . </S>"
