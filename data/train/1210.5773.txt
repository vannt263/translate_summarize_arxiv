    "this paper is motivated by the mathematical analysis of the emissions markets , as implemented for example in the european union ( eu ) emissions trading scheme ( ets ) .",
    "these market mechanisms have been hailed by some as the most cost efficient way to control green house gas ( ghg ) emissions .",
    "they have been criticized by others for being a tax in disguise and adding to the burden of industries covered by the regulation .",
    "implementation of cap - and - trade schemes is not limited to the implementation of the kyoto protocol .",
    "the successful us acid rain program is a case in point .",
    "however , a widespread lack of understanding of their properties , and misinformation campaigns by advocacy groups more interested in pushing their political agendas than using the results of objective scientific studies have muddied the water and add to the confusion .",
    "more mathematical studies are needed to increase the understanding of these market mechanisms and raise the level of awareness of their advantages as well as their shortcomings .",
    "this paper was prepared in this spirit .    in a first part",
    ", we introduce simple single - firm models inspired by the workings of the electricity markets ( electric power generation is responsible for most of the co@xmath0 emissions worldwide ) . despite the specificity of some assumptions ,",
    "our treatment is quite general in the sense that individual risk averse power producers choose their own utility functions .",
    "moreover , the financial markets in which they trade emission allowances are not assumed to be complete .    while market incompleteness prevents us from identifying the optimal trading strategy of each producer ,",
    "we show that , independently of the choice of the utility function , the optimal production or abatement strategy is what we expect by proving mathematically , and in full generality ( i.e. without assuming completeness of the markets ) , a _",
    "folk theorem _ in environmental economics : the equilibrium allowance price equals the marginal abatement cost , and market participants implement all the abatement measures whose costs are not greater than the cost of compliance ( i.e. the equilibrium price of an allowance ) .",
    "the next section puts together the economic activities of a large number of producers and searches for the existence of an equilibrium price for the emissions allowances .",
    "such a problem leads naturally to a _",
    "forward _ stochastic differential equation ( sde ) for the aggregate emissions in the economy , and a _ backward _ stochastic differential equation ( bsde ) for the allowance price .",
    "however , these equations are `` coupled '' since a nonlinear function of the _ price of carbon _",
    "( i.e. the price of an emission allowance ) appears in the forward equation giving the dynamics of the aggregate emissions .",
    "this feedback of the emission price in the dynamics of the emissions is quite natural . for the purpose of option pricing , this approach was described in @xcite where it was called _ detailed risk neutral approach_.    forward backward stochastic differential equations ( fbsdes ) of the type considered in this section have been studied for a long time .",
    "see for example @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "however , the fbsdes we need to consider for the purpose of emission prices have an unusual pecularity : the terminal condition of the backward equation is given by a discontinuous function of the terminal value of the state driven by the forward equation .",
    "we use our first model to prove that this lack of continuity is not an issue when the forward dynamics are _ strongly elliptic _ in the neighborhood of the singularities of the terminal condition , in other words when the volatility of the forward sde is bounded from below in the neighborhood of the discontinuities of the terminal value .",
    "however , using our second equilibrium model , we also show that when the forward dynamics are degenerate ( even if they are hypoelliptic ) , discontinuities in the terminal condition and lack of strong ellipticity in the forward dynamics can conspire to produce point masses in the terminal distribution of the forward component , at the locations of the discontinuities .",
    "this implies that the terminal value of the backward component is not given by a deterministic function of the forward component , for the forward scenarios ending at the locations of jumps in the terminal condition , and justifies relaxing the definition of a solution of the fbsde .",
    "even though we only present a detailed proof for a very specific model for the sake of definiteness , we believe that our result is representative of a large class of models .",
    "since from the point of view of the definition of `` aggregate emissions '' , the degeneracy of the forward dynamics is expected , this seemingly pathological result should not be overlooked .",
    "indeed , it sheds new light on an absolute continuity assumption made repeatedly in equilibrium analyses , even in discrete time models .",
    "see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this assumption was regarded as an annoying technicality , but in the light of the results of this paper , it looks more intrinsic to these types of models . in any case , it fully justifies the need to relax the definition of a solution of a fbsde when the terminal condition of the backward part jumps .    a vibrant market for options written on allowance futures / forward contracts has recently developed and increased in liquidity .",
    "see for example @xcite for details on these markets . reduced formed models have been proposed to price these options .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made at matching the smile ( or lack thereof ) contained in the quotes published daily by the exchanges .",
    "section [ se : option ] develops the technology needed to price these options in the context of the equilibrium framework developed in the present paper .",
    "we identify the option prices in terms of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations and we prove when the dynamics of the aggregate emissions are given by a geometric brownian motion , a taylor expansion formula when the nonlinear abatement feedback is small .",
    "we derive an explicit integral form for the first order taylor expansion coefficient which can easily be computed by monte carlo methods .",
    "we believe that the present paper is the first rigorous attempt to include the nonlinear feedback term in the dynamics of aggregate emissions for the purpose of emissions option pricing .",
    "the final section [ se : option ] was motivated by the desire to provide practical tools for the efficient computation of option prices within the equilibrium framework of the paper .",
    "indeed , because of the nonlinear feedback created by the coupling in the fbsde , option prices computed from our equilibrium model differ from the _ linear _ prices computed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in the framework of reduced form models .",
    "we derive rigorously an approximation based on the first order asymptotics in the nonlinear feedback .",
    "this approximation can be used to compute numerically option prices and has the potential to efficiently fit the implied volatility smile present in recent option price quotes .",
    "the final subsection [ sub : numerics ] illustrates numerically the properties of our approximation .    _",
    "acknowledgements : _ we would like to thank two anonymous referees for pointing out inconsistencies in the original proofs of theorem [ thmsec3 ] and proposition [ prop:1:1 ] , and for insightful comments which led to improvements in the presentation of the results of the paper .",
    "we first describe the optimization problem of a single power producer facing a carbon cap - and - trade regulation .",
    "we assume that this producer is a small player in the market in the sense that his actions have no impact on prices and that a liquid market for pollution permits exists .",
    "in particular , we assume that the price of an allowance is given exogenously , and we use the notation @xmath1 for the ( stochastic ) time evolution of the price of such an emission allowance . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath2 $ ] is a single phase of the regulation and that no banking or borrowing of the certificates is possible at the end of the phase . for illustration purposes , we analyze two simple models .",
    "strangely enough , the first steps of these analyses , namely the identifications of the optimal abatement and production strategies , do not require the full force of the sophisticated techniques of optimal stochastic control .",
    "we assume that the source of randomness in the model is given by @xmath3 , a finite family of independent one - dimensional wiener processes @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , @xmath6 for each fixed @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "all these wiener processes are assumed to be defined on a complete probability space @xmath8 , and we denote by @xmath9 the brownian filtration they generate . here , @xmath10 is a fixed time horizon representing the end of the regulation period .",
    "we will eventually extend the model to include @xmath11 firms , but for the time being , we consider only the problem of one single firm whose production of electricity generates emissions of carbon dioxyde , and we denote by @xmath12 the cumulative emissions up to time @xmath13 of the firm .",
    "we also denote by @xmath14 the perception at time @xmath13 ( for example the conditional expectation ) of what the total cumulative emission @xmath15 will be at the end of the time horizon",
    ". clearly , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be different stochastic processes , but they have the same terminal values at time @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "we will assume that the dynamics of the proxy @xmath17 for the cumulative emissions of the firm are given by an it process of the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the ( conditional ) expectation of what the rate of emission would be in a world without carbon regulation , in other words in what is usually called _ business as usual _",
    "( bau for short ) , while @xmath22 is the instantaneous rate of abatement chosen by the firm . in mathematical terms , @xmath22 represents the control on emission reduction implemented by the firm .",
    "clearly , in such a model , the firm only acts on the drift of its _ perceived _ emissions . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the processes @xmath21 and @xmath23 are adapted and bounded .",
    "because of the vector nature of the brownian motion @xmath24 , the volatility process @xmath23 is in fact a vector of scalar volatility processes @xmath25 . for the purpose of this section , we could use one single scalar wiener process and one single scalar volatility process as long as we allow the filtration @xmath26 to be larger than the filtration generated by this single wiener process .",
    "this fact will be needed when we study a model with more than one firm .",
    "notice that the formulation does not guarantee the positiveness of the perceived emissions process , as one would expect it to be .",
    "this issue will be discussed in proposition [ prop : sign ] below , where we provide sufficient conditions on the coefficients of in order to guarantee the positiveness of the process @xmath17 .",
    "continuing on with the description of the model , we assume that the abatement decision is based on a cost function @xmath27 which is assumed to be continuously differentiable ( @xmath28 in notation ) , strictly convex and satisfy inada - like conditions : @xmath29 note that @xmath30 exists because of the assumption of strict convexity .",
    "since @xmath31 can be interpreted as the cost to the firm for an abatement rate of level @xmath32 , without any loss of generality we will also assume @xmath33 .",
    "notice that ( [ fo : inada ] ) implies that @xmath34 .",

    "the firm controls its destiny by choosing its own abatement schedule @xmath22 as well as the quantity @xmath39 of pollution permits it holds through trading in the allowance market . for these controls to be admissible , @xmath22 and @xmath39 need only to be progressively measurable processes satisfying the integrability condition @xmath40dt<\\infty.\\ ] ] we denote by @xmath41 the set of admissible controls @xmath42 . given its initial wealth @xmath32 , the terminal wealth @xmath43 of the firm is given by : @xmath44 the first integral in the right hand side of the above equation gives the proceeds from trading in the allowance market .",
    "recall that we use the notation @xmath45 for the price of an emission allowance at time @xmath13 .",
    "the next term represents the abatement costs , and the last term gives the costs of the emission regulation .",
    "recall also that at this stage , we are not interested in the existence or the formation of this price .",
    "we merely assume the existence of a liquid and frictionless market for emission allowances , and that @xmath45 is the price at which each firm can buy or sell one allowance at time @xmath13 .",
    "the risk preferences of the firm are given by a utility function @xmath46 , which is assumed to be @xmath28 , increasing , strictly concave and satisfying the inada conditions : @xmath47 the optimization problem of the firm can be written as the computation of : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the expectation under the _ historical _ measure @xmath50 , and @xmath41 is the set of abatement and trading strategies @xmath42 admissible to the firm .",
    "the following simple result holds .",
    "the optimal abatement strategy of the firm is given by : @xmath51^{-1}(y_t).\\ ] ]    notice that the optimal abatement schedule is independent of the utility function .",
    "the beauty of this simple result is its powerful intuitive meaning : given a price @xmath45 for an emission allowance , the firm implements all the abatement measures which make sense economically , namely all those costing less than the current market price of one allowance ( i.e. one unit of emission ) .    by an immediate integration by parts in the expression ( [ fo : terminal_wealth ] ) of the terminal wealth",

    "the proof is complete once we notice that @xmath63 is increasing and that for each @xmath64 $ ] and each @xmath65 , the quantity @xmath66 is maximized by the choice @xmath67 .",
    "the above result argues neither existence nor uniqueness of an optimal admissible set @xmath68 of controls . in the context of a complete market , once the optimal rate of abatement @xmath69 is implemented , the optimal investment strategy @xmath70 should hedge the financial risk created by the implementation of the abatement strategy .",
    "this fact can be proved using the classical tools of portfolio optimization in the case of complete market models . indeed , if we introduce the convex dual @xmath71 of @xmath63 defined by : @xmath72 and the function @xmath73 by @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and if we denote by @xmath49 and @xmath76 respectively the expectations with respect to @xmath50 and the unique equivalent measure @xmath77 under which @xmath78 is a martingale ( we write @xmath79 for its volatility given by the martingale representation theorem ) , then from the a.s .",

    "it follows that @xmath87 and finally , if the market is complete , the claim @xmath88 is attainable by a certain @xmath70 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we consider a second model for which again , part of the global stochastic optimization problem reduces to a mere path - by - path optimization . as before ,",
    "the model is simplistic , especially in the case of a single firm in a regulatory environment with a liquid frictionless market for emission allowances .",
