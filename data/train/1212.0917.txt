    "quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , which is one of the most important quantities for both quantum estimation theory and quantum information theory , has been widely studied @xcite . in the field of quantum estimation ,",
    "the main task is to determine the value of an unknown parameter labeling the quantum system , and a primary goal is to enhance the precision of the resolution @xcite .",
    "the inverse of the qfi provides the lower bound of error of the estimation @xcite .",
    "hence , how to increase the qfi become the key problem to be solved .",
    "moreover , the qfi can be used to measure the statistical distinguishability on the space of the density operators in the quantum information geometry @xcite .",
    "recently , the qfi flow was proposed as a quantitative measure of the information flow and provides a novel perspective on observing the non - markovian behavior in open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "there are several variants of quantum versions of fisher information , among which the one based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) operator has been used most widely and possesses many good properties @xcite , such as convexity , remaining invariant under the unitary evolution , and the total amount of the qfi equivalent to the summation of the qfis of all subsystem being uncorrelated . in this paper",
    ", we also study another variant of the quantum version of the fisher information , which is closely related with the skew information @xcite .",
    "the skew information was proposed to measure the amount of information that a quantum state contains with respect to the observable which does not commute with additive conserved quantities , such as hamiltonians , momenta @xcite .",
    "it is also used to measure the quantum uncertainty @xcite and quantify quantum correlations in bipartite state in a recent work @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall show that the two qfis formally possess many similar features @xcite , but they are different not only for the concrete expressions of the definitions , but also for their applications .",
    "as is mentioned previously , the qfi based on sld operator is mainly applied in the quantum metrology , however , the variant version of the qfi plays an important role in quantum state discrimination @xcite .    from the information theory , both two different qfis",
    "characterize the content of information contained in the quantum systems .",
    "a crucial property of these two information quantities is that they decrease monotonically under the completely positive and trace - preserving ( cpt ) maps  @xcite .",
    "the monotonicity property manifests the information loss under the cpt map .",
    "just as the introduction of the qfi flow @xcite , can we observe the non - markovian properties from the other information quantities perspective ?",
    "here , we will address this problem by calculating these two qfis for a single qubit and derive the explicit formulas in the bloch representation , which greatly facilitates the computing of these two quantities .",
    "the main results in this paper are that the dynamical qfis , in the presence of decoherences , are analytically solved . here , the irreversible processes are modeled via three decoherence channels @xcite : phase - damping channel  ( pdc ) , depolarizing channel  ( pdc ) , and the generalized amplitude damping channel  ( gadc ) @xcite .",
    "the analytical results for the two information quantities under those channels are obtained .",
    "we will show that the values of the two qfis monotonically decrease with time , apart from the isolated case that the qfi based on the sld operator about the amplitude parameter @xmath1 remain invariant under the pdc . in order to further identify the behaviors of the two qfis subject to quantum noise",
    ", we discuss a simple model of a two - level system coupled to a reservoir with a lorentzian spectral density @xcite . by using the hierarchy equation method",
    ", we numerically analyze the dynamics of the two qfis , and compare these with the analytical solutions by using the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "we further generalize the results to the qudit system .",

    "<S> the dynamics of two variants of quantum fisher information under decoherence are investigated from a geometrical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive the explicit formulas of these two quantities for a single qubit in terms of the bloch vector . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we obtain analytical results for them under three different decoherence channels , which are expressed as affine transformation matrices . using the hierarchy equation method </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically study the dynamics of both the two information in a dissipative model and compare the numerical results with the analytical ones obtained by applying the rotating - wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we further express the two information quantities in terms of the bloch vector for a qudit , by expanding the density matrix and hermitian operators in a common set of generators of the lie algebra @xmath0 . by calculating the dynamical quantum fisher information , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the collisional dephasing significantly diminishes the precision of phase parameter with the ramsey interferometry . </S>"
