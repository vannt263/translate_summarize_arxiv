    "on 4th july 2012 , the atlas and cms collaborations have announced the observation of a higgs boson with a mass around 125 gev at the lhc @xcite .",
    "this discovery implies a great success of the sm and opens an era of the precise study of higgs boson . up to now , although most measurements of the higgs boson properties are consistent with the sm predictions@xcite , there are still rooms for the new physics that contributes to effective couplings to gluons and photons @xcite . since the interactions between higgs boson and gauge bosons are sensitive to the new physics , any modifications of the higgs gauge couplings will lead to the deviation of the sm predictions from the higgs data@xcite .",
    "besides , the higgs gauge couplings are strongly related to the anomalous triple vector bosons vertex@xcite .",
    "thus , the precise study of higgs gauge couplings is important for testing the sm and searching for new physics .",
    "there have been many works devoted to investigating the higgs gauge couplings from the processes of @xmath8 , which have been calculated to the next - to - leading order(nlo ) in the sm at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in addition , the production of higgs boson associated with dibosons can also be used to probe the higgs gauge couplings @xcite , such as @xmath9 . among these processes ,",
    "only @xmath10 have been recently calculated with nlo qcd corrections in ref.@xcite . due to the gauge symmetry , the ratio of tree - level production rates of @xmath11 is predicted to be @xmath12 in the sm at very large energy scale .",
    "the measurement of this ratio can be served as a good test of the couplings between higgs and a vector boson pair .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the next - to - leading order qcd corrections to the production process of @xmath0 in the sm at 14 tev lhc . due to the trilepton signals and a reconstructed higgs mass in the final states ,",
    "the process of @xmath0 in the sm may be detected at the lhc . besides",
    ", this process will be an important background of new physics signal @xmath13 in some extensions of the sm gauge group , where the predicted extra gauge boson @xmath14 only couples with the gauge bosons and higgs boson@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we present the description of the nlo calculation of the process @xmath0 . then , we give the numerical results and discussions in sec.iii . finally , we give a short summary in sec.iv .",
    "the leading order(lo ) process of @xmath16 is induced by the electro - weak interaction in the sm .",
    "we denote the four - momenta of initial and final states in the process as follows : @xmath17 the nlo qcd corrections(@xmath18 ) to the above process can be divided into the following parts in the calculations :    * the virtual corrections(@xmath19 ) : @xmath20 ; * the real gluon emission corrections(@xmath21 ) : @xmath22 ; * the real light-(anti)quark emission corrections(@xmath23 ) : @xmath24 .",
    "we generate the one - loop amplitudes by the feynarts-3.5@xcite .",
    "we use the formcalc-6.1@xcite to simplify the amplitudes and reduce the loop functions as the definitions in ref@xcite .",
    "we adopt the dimensional regularization to isolate all the ultraviolet divergences ( uv ) and infrared divergences ( ir ) in the virtual corrections .",
    "we remove the uv divergences by the counter terms fixed by the on - mass - shell renormalization condition@xcite .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) singularities from the one - loop integral can be cancelled by adding the contributions of the real gluon emissions .",
    "we deal with the ir divergences in feynman integrals as ref.@xcite and implement the numerical calculations for the ir safe parts of n - point integrals as ref.@xcite .",
    "the loop functions in the virtual corrections are numerically calculated by the modified package of looptools-2.2@xcite .    by using the above packages",
    ", we adopt the two cutoff phase space slicing ( tcpss ) method @xcite to isolate the ir singularity in the real gluon emission process @xmath25 , where the four - momenta for the initial and final states are denoted as follows : @xmath26 an arbitrary small cutoff parameter @xmath27 is introduced to split the phase space into soft region(@xmath28 ) and hard region(@xmath29 ) .",
    "we further divide the hard part into hard collinear region @xmath30",
    "( @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) and hard non - collinear region @xmath33 ( @xmath31 and @xmath34 ) by the cutoff parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . the soft part and hard collinear part will be canceled with the ir divergences in the virtual corrections .",
    "so the cross section of the process of @xmath25 can be decomposed as followings : @xmath37    besides , we also consider the contribution from the real light quark emission process @xmath38 , where the four - momenta for the initial and final states are denoted as follows : @xmath39 it should be mentioned that only the initial state collinear singularities can occur in the eq.([light - quark ] ) , which can be absorbed into the redefinition of the pdfs at the nlo .",
    "while , for the non - collinear part , it is computed by using the monte carlo technique @xcite.so the cross section of the process of @xmath38 can be divided as followings : @xmath40 we implement all the above calculations as in our previous works @xcite and numerically checked our results with the madgraph5-v2 that includes the packages of madloop and amc@xmath41nlo @xcite and found they are consistent in the reasonable error range .",
    "the sm parameters used in our numerical calculation are @xcite : @xmath42 besides , the ckm matrix elements are taken as @xmath43 the higgs mass is taken as @xmath44 gev from the combined results of atlas and cms in ref.@xcite . for the strong coupling constant @xmath45 , we evaluate it by the 2-loop evolution with qcd parameter @xmath46 mev .",
    "we use cteq6l1 and cteq6 m parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for the lo and nlo qcd computations , respectively@xcite .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath47 and factorization scale @xmath48 are chosen to be @xmath49 .     on cutoffs @xmath27 and @xmath50 at 14 tev lhc ,",
    "where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; ( b ) the amplified curve marked with the calculation errors for @xmath18 versus @xmath27.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   on cutoffs @xmath27 and @xmath50 at 14 tev lhc , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; ( b ) the amplified curve marked with the calculation errors for @xmath18 versus @xmath27.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    although the splitting of phase space depends on the cutoff parameters @xmath27 and @xmath35 , the nlo qcd corrections should be independent of these unphysical parameters . in the tcpss method@xcite",
    ", @xmath35 is inclined to be much smaller than @xmath27 to guarantee the accuracy in the numerical calculations .",
    "here we assume the collinear cutoff parameter @xmath53 and the renormalization scale @xmath54 .",
    "from the left panel of fig.[cutoff ] , we can see that the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 change with the variation of the soft cutoff @xmath27 .",
    "but the total correction @xmath18 is independent of the @xmath27 within the reasonable calculation errors . on the right panel of fig.[cutoff ] , we display the amplified curve of @xmath18 versus @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we can take @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the following calculations .",
    "process on the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath59 ; ( b ) the relative correction of the total nlo corrected cross section to the lo cross section .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   process on the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath59 ; ( b ) the relative correction of the total nlo corrected cross section to the lo cross section",
    ". , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we present the dependence of lo and nlo qcd corrected cross sections of @xmath0 production on the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath3 at 14 tev lhc in fig.[total ] .",
    "it can be seen that the lo and nlo qcd corrected cross sections can reach 4.2 fb and 6 fb respectively and the corresponding relative correction is 46% when @xmath60 . if we vary the scale @xmath3 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , we find that the uncertainty of nlo qcd cross section @xmath63 is larger than the one of lo cross section @xmath64 .",
    "the reason is that the lo process of @xmath0 is induced by the pure electroweak interactions and is not sensitive to the change of renormalization scale .    due to the unbalance of pdf ,",
    "the cross section of @xmath65 is larger than the one of @xmath66 .",
    "this asymmetry can be measured through the leptonic decay of @xmath67 boson by examining the difference between event numbers with one lepton and those with one anti - lepton in the signal .",
    "so we can define the charge asymmetry in the process of @xmath0 as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the event number of final states @xmath70(@xmath71 ) . in tab.[tab1 ] , we display the charge asymmetry for different renormalization and factorization scale @xmath3 .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath72 have the weak dependence on the scale @xmath3 , due to the cancellation between numerator and denominator .",
    "compared with the lo prediction of @xmath72 , the nlo qcd correction will slightly reduce the value of @xmath72 to 32.94% when @xmath73 .",
    "p2 cm < p2 cm < p2 cm <",
    "p2 cm < @xmath72(% ) & @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath62 + lo & 33.38 & 33.43 & 33.50 + nlo & 32.70 & 32.94 & 33.46 +     from @xmath76 decays ( @xmath77 ) and the separation between the two @xmath78-jets from higgs boson decays ( @xmath79 ) and the corresponding @xmath80-factors in the process @xmath81 at 14 tev lhc.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ]   from @xmath76 decays ( @xmath77 ) and the separation between the two @xmath78-jets from higgs boson decays ( @xmath79 ) and the corresponding @xmath80-factors in the process @xmath81 at 14 tev lhc.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=234 ]    in fig.[distribution ] , we study the lo and nlo qcd corrected transverse momentum distributions of @xmath82 from @xmath76 decays ( @xmath77 ) and the separation between the two @xmath78-jets from higgs boson decays ( @xmath83 ) in the process of @xmath81 at 14 tev lhc . in the calculations , we use the branching ratios of @xmath84@xcite and @xmath85@xcite . from fig.[distribution ] , we can see that the nlo qcd correction can greatly enhance the lo differential cross section .",
    "the distribution of @xmath77 peaks around 40 gev(@xmath86 ) and the two b - jets are incline to fly back - to - back since they come from the higgs boson .",
    "the main backgrounds of the signal @xmath87 are : ( i ) @xmath88 ; ( ii ) @xmath89 ; ( iii ) @xmath90 . for ( i)-(ii )",
    ", they may resemble the signal when an isr / fsr jet is mis - identified as a lepton .",
    "we notice that these backgrounds are much larger than our signal so that the observation of the signal may be challenge at the high luminosity lhc(hl - lhc )",
    ". however , the following kinematic features may be helpful to improve the observability : since the two @xmath78-jets in the backgrounds are from the top quark and anti - top quark , a narrow window of the invariant mass of @xmath91 around 125 gev can be used to greatly reduce the above backgrounds .",
    "besides , the fake lepton from isr / fsr jet is usually not energetic , so the veto of the third soft lepton will further suppress ( i ) and ( ii ) backgrounds . it should be noted that the background ( ii ) can also be removed by imposing the cut of the transverse mass of lepton and missing energy , because the fake lepton does not come from the @xmath67 boson decay . on the other hand ,",
    "the missing energy in the backgrounds ( i ) and ( iii ) are larger than that in the signal , due to the leptonic decay top quark pair .",
    "thus , we can also reduce these two backgrounds by requiring a small missing energy .",
    "of course , the results of these cuts strongly depend on the detector simulation .",
    "however , since the realistic detector configures of the hl - lhc are still not available , we expect our analysis can be improved by optimizing signal extraction strategies and better understanding of the backgrounds uncertainties through the dedicated analysis of the experimental collaborations at hl - lhc .",
    "in this paper , we performed a complete nlo qcd corrections calculation for @xmath5 at 14 tev lhc .",
    "we found that the nlo qcd corrections can enhance the lo cross section and the relative correction can reach about 45% .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the lo and nlo corrected cross sections on the renormalization and factorization scale and found that the scale uncertainty of lo and nlo qcd cross section are @xmath64 and @xmath63 respectively , when the scale @xmath3 changes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "we also studied the kinematic distributions of the final state , which will be helpful to select the @xmath92 events at 14 tev lhc .",
    "we appreciate the helpful discussions with lei wu .",
