    "it has been recently shown @xcite that a constant magnetic field in @xmath1 and @xmath0 dimensions is a strong catalyst of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , leading to the generation of a fermion dynamical mass even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions .",
    "the essence of the effect is the dimensional reduction @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) in the infrared dynamics of the fermion pairing in a magnetic field .",
    "the physical reason of this reduction is the fact that the motion of charged particles is restricted in those directions that are perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this is in turn connected with the point that , at weak coupling between fermions , the fermion pairing , leading to the chiral condensate , is mostly provided by fermions from the lowest landau level ( lll ) whose dynamics are ( @xmath5)dimensional .    in this paper , we shall further clarify the effect of the dynamical reduction , studying in detail the infrared dynamics in the ( @xmath0)dimensional nambu ",
    "jona  lasinio ( njl ) model in a magnetic field .",
    "we shall consider both the ordinary ( non  supersymmetric ) and supersymmetric versions of the njl model .",
    "in particular , we shall show that in the  continuum \" limit , when both the strength of the magnetic field and the ultraviolet cutoff go to infinity , both the non  supersymmetric and supersymmetric ( weakly coupling ) njl models with @xmath6 colors are reduced to a continuum set of independent ( 1 + 1)dimensional gross - neveu ( gn ) models @xcite , labeled by coordinates @xmath7 in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "the number of colors in the gn models is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is @xmath11 in the  continuum \" limit ( here @xmath12 is the ultraviolet cutoff ) .",
    "as will be shown in sec.3 , the factor @xmath13 is proportional to a ( local ) magnetic flux attached to each point in the @xmath14-plane .    on the other hand , at strong coupling , the dynamics in the supersymmetric and non  supersymmtric njl models are very different .",
    "recall that there is no spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the supersymmetric njl model @xcite .",
    "an external magnetic field changes the situation dramatically : chiral symmetry breaking occurs for any value of the coupling constant in this model .",
    "this agrees with the general conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite that the effect of the catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking by a magnetic field in @xmath0 dimensions is a universal , model  independent effect .    as was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dimensional reduction @xmath4 in the dynamics of the fermion pairing in a ( finite ) magnetic field is consistent with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "recall that , due to the mermin  wagner ",
    "coleman ( mwc ) theorem @xcite , there can not be spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries at @xmath15 .",
    "the mwc theorem is based on the fact that gapless nambu  goldstone ( ng ) bosons can not exist in @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "however , in a magnetic field , the reduction @xmath4 takes place ( in the infrared region ) only for propagators of charged particles : it reflects the fact that the motion of charged particles is restricted in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "ng bosons connected with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking are neutral and therefore their propagators have ( @xmath0)dimensional form @xcite)dimensional form , we understand that the denominator of the propagators depends on energy and all the components of the center  of  mass momentum , i.e. @xmath17 with @xmath18 . ] .",
    "this in turn implies that the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking does not contradict the mwc theorem .",
    "the interplay between the gn model and the njl model in a magnetic field established in this paper further clarifies this issue .",
    "as was mentioned above , the njl model is reduced to a set of the gn models only as the strength of the magnetic field goes to infinity .",
    "as we shall show in sec.4 , at finite @xmath19 , the dynamics of the njl model in a magnetic field are in a sense similar to the dynamics in the ( @xmath20)dimensional gn model : the magnetic length @xmath21 plays here the role of the ( physical ) @xmath22parameter which is an infrared regulator .",
    "as was already pointed out in refs.@xcite , there may be interesting applications of this effect in cosmology as well as in particle and condensed matter physics .",

    "it would be worth deriving this reduction in a more rigorous way , putting the njl model on a lattice in euclidean space and then realizing renormalizations in the  continuum \" limit .    in the next section",

    "in the previous section , the reduction of the njl model in a magnetic field of the infinite strength to a continuum set of the gn models was established .",
