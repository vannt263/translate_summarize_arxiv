    "quantile regression [ koenker and bassett ( @xcite ) ] , concerning models for conditional quantile functions , has developed into a primary statistical methodology to investigate functional relationship between a response and covariates .",
    "targeting the full spectrum of quantiles , it provides a far more complete statistical analysis than , say , classical linear regression .",
    "this technique has a long history in econometric applications .",
    "more recently , quantile regression has also been advocated for survival analysis to address evolving covariate effects which is a common phenomenon in demographic and clinical research among others .",
    "for instance , the aging process as well as the effects of its determinants can be vastly different at various stages of life [ cf .",
    "koenker and geling ( @xcite ) ] . on the other hand",
    ", a clinical intervention can rarely be expected to have a constant effect , due to the time lag in reaching full effect and to drug resistance .",
    "the quantile regression model allows for varying regression coefficients and thus suits these applications well .",
    "however , a main challenge arises from censoring .",
    "denote the survival time by @xmath1 and the censoring time by @xmath2 . as a result of censoring , @xmath1 is not directly observed but through follow - up time @xmath3 and censoring indicator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the minimization operator and @xmath6 is the indicator function .",
    "of interest is the relationship between @xmath1 and a @xmath7 covariate vector @xmath8 with constant 1 as the leading component .",
    "quantile function is an inverse of the distribution function @xmath9 .",
    "however , ambiguities arise in the presence of zero - density intervals ; for example , zero mortality is not uncommon at the beginning of many clinical trials since new enrollees are relatively healthy . to be definitive ,",
    "we adopt the _ cadlag inverse _ , that is , the inverse function that is right - continuous with left - hand limits .",
    "the @xmath10th conditional quantile of @xmath1 given @xmath8 is defined as @xmath11 the quantile regression model postulates that @xmath12 where @xmath13 , referred to as the quantile coefficient , is a function of probability @xmath10 .",
    "this model is semiparametric in general , but nonparametric in the @xmath0-sample problem .",
    "the interest in evolving covariate effects necessitates the functional modeling of ( [ mod1 ] ) , which distinguishes itself from the modeling on a specific quantile as in , for example , median regression ; see section [ sec6 ] for further discussion .",
    "note that the time scale may be , say , logarithm - transformed , and accordingly the supports of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath14 are not necessarily restricted to the nonnegative half line .",
    "when all components of @xmath13 except the intercept are constant in @xmath10 , this model reduces to the accelerated failure time mode as studied by buckley and james ( @xcite ) and tsiatis ( @xcite ) among others . in this regard ,",
    "the quantile regression model is a varying - coefficient generalization . to provide an interpretation , suppose for the moment that model ( [ mod1 ] )",
    "holds on the logarithmic time scale .",
    "then , the effect of a covariate , other than the leading 1 of @xmath8 , is to stretch or compress the baseline survival time ( on the original scale ) with a quantile - dependent stretching or compressing factor .    with uncensored data , koenker and bassett ( @xcite ) generalized sample quantile and proposed regression quantile as a quantile coefficient estimator via a convex objective function .",
    "an adaptation of the well - known barrodale ",
    "roberts algorithm was later suggested by koenker and dorey ( @xcite ) for the computation .",
    "the reliability and efficiency of this algorithm contribute to broader acceptance of the standard methodology . in the presence of censoring , powell ( @xcite , @xcite ) proposed an estimation procedure when censoring time @xmath2 is always observed .",
    "his approach applies uncensored quantile regression to @xmath14 as the @xmath10th quantile of @xmath14 turns out to be @xmath15 .",
    "however , in most survival studies , not only is the survival time subject to censoring but also the censoring time is unobserved for uncensored individuals .",
    "taking the missing - data perspective of censoring , ying , jung and wei ( @xcite ) and honor , khan and powell ( @xcite ) developed different methods but with the common consistent estimation requirement of the censoring distribution given covariates .",
    "this amounts to either an unconditional independence censoring mechanism , or a finite - number limitation on covariate values , or additional censoring - time modeling to achieve a root-@xmath16 convergence rate of the estimated censoring distribution .",
    "obviously , none of these is desirable .",
    "ying , jung and wei ( @xcite ) indicated that such a restriction may be relieved by employing smoothing techniques to nonparametrically estimate the conditional censoring distribution .",
    "as an alternative , wang and wang ( @xcite ) developed a method by nonparametrically estimating the conditional survival distribution via kernel smoothing .",
    "nevertheless , robins and ritov ( @xcite ) argued that these smoothing - based methods may not be practical with moderate sample size in the presence of multiple continuously - distributed covariates ; see also portnoy ( @xcite ) .",
    "our investigation focuses on the same preceding data structure , but aims to allow for generalities on both the censoring mechanism and covariates .",
    "specifically , we consider conditional independence censoring mechanism : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes statistical independence .",
    "this problem was first investigated by portnoy ( @xcite ) , who suggested the pivoting method employing the redistribution - to - the - right imputation scheme for censoring [ efron ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the mass of censored observations is recursively redistributed to adopt standard uncensored quantile regression .",
    "however , one premise is the quantile monotonicity so that the `` right , '' or future , is unequivocal in the redistribution . in the @xmath0-sample case",
    ", the monotonicity holds in uncensored sample quantile , and the method reduces to the kaplan  meier method , that is , taking an inverse of the kaplan ",
    "meier estimator .",
    "unfortunately , uncensored quantile regression in general does not respect the monotonicity , leading to both algorithmic and analytic difficulties with portnoy ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic properties of the estimator have not yet been established ; see neocleous , vanden branden and portnoy ( @xcite ) . as an alternative , neocleous , vanden branden and portnoy ( @xcite ) advocated a closely related grid method .",
    "most recently , peng and huang ( @xcite ) proposed a functional estimating function upon discovering a martingale structure , and developed a grid - based quantile coefficient estimator . both uniform consistency and weak convergence",
    "have been established . as for the last two methods , the grid dependence , however , might not be completely satisfactory .",
    "this article makes two main contributions to this problem .",
    "first of all , fundamental and general quantile calculus is developed on probability scale , establishing the probability - scale dynamics with allowance for zero - density intervals and discontinuities in a distribution .",
    "second , from quantile calculus a well - defined estimator and a reliable and efficient algorithm for censored quantile regression naturally emerge on the basis of estimating integral equations . as compared with portnoy ( @xcite ) , neocleous , vanden branden and portnoy ( @xcite ) and peng and huang ( @xcite ) , this new approach entails neither algorithmic complications nor a probability grid .",
    "for the rest of this article , quantile calculus is presented in section  [ sec2 ] , and the proposed estimator and algorithm in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the asymptotic properties are investigated and an inference procedure suggested in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] presents simulation results on statistical and algorithmic performance , and an illustration with a clinical study .",
    "section [ sec6 ] concludes with discussion .",
    "the proofs are collected in appendices [ appa][appe ] .",
    "given a survival distribution , a one - to - many mapping from probability to time scale may arise from zero - density intervals ; adopting the cadlag definition of quantile function is a solution given in the .",
    "reciprocally , a one - to - many mapping from time to probability scale may also arise , resulting from distributional discontinuities .",
    "thus , time - scale theories including counting - process martingales can not be applied to probability scale , unless continuity restriction is imposed on the distribution . in uncensored quantile regression , this issue may be bypassed by formulating the estimation as an optimization problem .",
    "however , such an approach may not be feasible in censored quantile regression , which calls for the development of quantile calculus .",
    "drop @xmath8 from the notation in this case . by definition , @xmath19 .",
