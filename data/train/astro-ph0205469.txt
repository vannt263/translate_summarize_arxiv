    "it is now almost 20 years that the `` cold dark matter '' paradigm ( cdm ) , in which most of the matter in the universe is assumed to be collisionless dark matter , has been regarded as the standard cosmological model of the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "the cdm model ( and particularly its variant @xmath13cdm ) has achieved many successes in describing current observations , especially with regard to the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large - scale clustering properties of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , however , many have drawn attention to the problems @xmath13cdm has describing structure on galaxy scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one problem with cdm is that it predicts that all galaxies , including elliptical galaxies , should possess massive dark matter halos . but",
    "definitive evidence for such halos in isolated elliptical galaxies has proven difficult to establish .",
    "stellar dynamical analyses have made significant progress limiting the uncertainties on the radial mass profile in es due to velocity dispersion anisotropy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a recent study by @xcite argues that interstellar dust in es renders such mass determinations unreliable .",
    "gravitational lensing studies have the potential to provide important constraints on the mass distributions in elliptical galaxies from statistical analysis of the weak shear fields of many galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "statistical averaging of the properties of strong lenses has not yet provided clear evidence for dark matter in isolated es ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * )",
    ".    there is evidence for dark matter in the outer halos ( @xmath14  kpc ) of elliptical galaxies obtained from kinematic tracers such as globular clusters , though for the few objects studied the inferred masses imply a surrounding group or cluster ( e.g. , in ngc 4472 , * ? ? ?",
    "accurate constraints on the radial temperature profiles of hot gas obtained by _ rosat _",
    "x - ray observations have indicated substantial amounts of dark matter for elliptical galaxies in the centers of groups ( e.g. , ngc 1399 , * ? ? ? * ) and clusters ( e.g. , m87 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but because they are fainter in x - rays , _ rosat _  ( and _ einstein _ , @xcite ) did not provide temperature profiles of sufficient accuracy to clearly demonstrate the need for dark matter in isolated es .",
    "it is clear that the evidence for dark matter in isolated elliptical galaxies just mentioned is not extensive , and even in disk galaxies the case for dark matter is not considered to be as strong as it once was ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even for those galaxies where dark matter is suggested on the basis of standard newtonian gravity , @xcite argue that all such evidence for dark matter can not be distinguished from general modified gravity theories , such as the modification of newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , proposed by @xcite .    a powerful test for dark matter that can distinguish dark matter from mond in isolated es is the `` geometric test for dark matter '' we introduced previously @xcite .",
    "the geometric test is a comparison between the ellipticities and orientations of the observed x - ray isophotes with those expected if the gravitating mass traces the same shape as the stellar light .",
    "applying this geometric test to the ellipticities of the _ rosat _  data of two isolated es and one isolated s0 galaxy , we found strong evidence for dark matter for the e4 galaxy ngc 720 ( 99% conf . ) and marginal evidence for the s0 galaxy ngc 1332 ( 90% conf . ) and the e4 galaxy ngc 3923 ( 80%-85% conf . ) ",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "the _ rosat",
    "_  data of ngc 720 also displayed an x - ray position angle twist .",
    "but this twist could not be explained with triaxial dark matter models @xcite which cast some doubt on whether the x - ray emission indeed traces the potential in ngc 720 . and",
    "since the evidence for dark matter in ngc 1332 and ngc 3923 is marginal , higher quality observations of these systems are required to assess more definitively the existence of dark matter halos .    for the galaxies mentioned above we inferred from the _ rosat_observations that the dark matter ellipticities range from approximately @xmath15 with some indication ( particularly in ngc 720 ) that the mass is flatter than the stellar distribution .",
    "these moderate ellipticities provide important constraints on competing models for the dark matter , some of which predict spherical halos",
    "@xcite , highly flattened halos @xcite , and moderately flattened halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "owing to the small number of measurements of the flattening of dark halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that such previous measurements are of limited accuracy , the different predictions for halo shapes have not yet been given a definitive test .",
    "we have obtained a high - resolution _ chandra _  observation of ngc 720 to reexamine the existence of a dark matter halo via the geometric test and to measure its flattening .",
    "a major issue to be addressed is the effect of discrete sources , such as have been found in large quantities for early - type galaxies with _ chandra_(e.g .",
    "* ) , on the conclusions drawn from lower resolution _ rosat _  data .",
    "although calculating triaxial models is beyond the scope of this paper , we will also measure the position angles of the x - ray isophotes and compare them to the previously published triaxial model of @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of @xmath16 mpc to ngc 720 for @xmath17  km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18  ( and @xmath19 ) in which case @xmath20  kpc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the data preparation in  [ obs ] .",
    "the treatment of point sources and the measurement of the x - ray ellipticities , position angles , and radial profile are discussed in  [ image ] .",
    "the geometric test for dark matter is performed in  [ geomtest ] .",
    "we examine the _ chandra _  constraints on the temperature profile in ",
    "[ temp ] and the ellipticity of the dark matter in  [ dm ] . finally , in  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "ngc 720 was observed with the acis - s3 camera for @xmath21  ks during ao-1 as part of the guaranteed - time - observer program ( pi garmire ) .",
    "the events list was corrected for charge - transfer inefficiency according to @xcite , and only events characterized by the standard _",
    "grades were used .",
    "the standard ciao software ( version 2.2.1 ) was used for most of the subsequent data preparation .    since the diffuse x - ray emission of ngc 720 fills the entire s3 chip , we used the standard background templates to model the background . when attempting to use the lc_clean script to clean the source events list of flares with the same screening criteria as the background templates , only 12  ks of data remained .",
    "examination of the original light curve reveals only one significant flare ( @xmath22  ks worth of data ) near the beginning of the observation , but the light curve does gently rise and fall during the rest of the observation so that most of the data does not lie within the standard 3-sigma clip . consequently , we excluded only the obvious flare leaving a total exposure of 34.4  ks .    because the quiescent background can vary typically by @xmath23 between observations , and we do not use exactly the same screening criteria as the templates ,",
    "it is necessary to normalize the background templates to match the ngc 720 observation .",
    "since ngc 720 has a gas temperature @xmath24 kev there is little emission from hot gas for energies @xmath25  kev .",
    "consequently , we normalized the s3 background template by comparing source and background counts in the 5 - 10 kev band extracted from regions near the edges of the s3 field .",
    "we binned the cleaned s3 events lists for the source and background into images of @xmath26 pixels ( actually @xmath27 pixels , but we shall round off throughout the paper ) . since background dominates at high energies we selected events with energies 0.3 - 3 kev .",
    "likely problems with the spectral calibration near the low end of the bandpass ( see  [ temp ] ) are not important for the imaging analysis .",
    "although vignetting is a small effect within @xmath28 of the aim point of the s3 where our analysis is concentrated , we explored the viability of using an exposure map to flatten the image .",
    "the inherent difficulty in constructing a single exposure map for the image of a diffuse source for instruments like acis has been discussed by @xcite and houck . since , however , the diffuse gas of ngc 720 is remarkably isothermal ( see  [ temp ] ) we are able to construct a well - defined `` weighted '' exposure map following the procedure on the ciao  website .",
    "( note we find no tangible differences in any results mentioned below if instead we use a monochromatic exposure map evaluated at 0.77 kev which is the peak of the counts spectrum . )    unfortunately , the current method for flat - fielding images introduces spurious features along node boundaries where the intrinsic exposure is small relative to the rest of the ccd .",
    "when the exposure map is divided into the raw image to create an exposure - corrected image , regions of relatively low exposure ( e.g. , node boundaries , bad columns , and edges ) require large corrections .",
    "any intrinsic errors in the exposure map in these regions , and any noise in the data , will be amplified as a result .    for ngc 720",
    "we find that dividing by the exposure map amplifies the linear distortion along the node 1 - 2 boundary that reaches within @xmath29 of the center of ngc 720 .",
    "ellipticities and position angles computed between radii of @xmath30 are systematically lower by @xmath31 with respect to their values obtained from the un - flattened image . we emphasize that in the raw image the linear distortion is very faint and very difficult to see , and imperceptable in the smoothed image displayed in figure [ fig.image ] ; i.e. , this feature has neglible effect on the ellipticities and position angles considering the statistical uncertainties on these quantities (  [ results ] ) .",
    "consequently , since we have a case where `` the cure is worse than the disease '' , when computing ellipticities and position angles we do not use the exposure - corrected image .",
    "but since this non - circular , low - surface brightness feature amplified by the exposure map has no perceptible effect on the azimuthally averaged radial profile , we do use the exposure - corrected image to account for the small effects of ( large - scale ) telescopic vignetting for analysis of the image radial profile .",
    "in figure [ fig.image ] we display the adaptively smoothed s3 image of ngc 720 within a radius of @xmath32 of the galaxy center with some isophotal contours overlaid .",
    "( this smoothing is done only for display purposes .",
    "all analysis discussed below is performed on the unsmoothed image ; cf .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) . the most striking difference between the _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the large number of point sources clearly detected by _",
    "chandra_. many of these sources are located within @xmath33 of the galaxy center .",
    "the morphology of the diffuse emission within @xmath34 of the galaxy center is similar to that described for previous _ rosat_observations .",
    "the isophotes are moderately flattened and the orientations of the outer isophotes appear to be tilted with respect to the innermost regions . but",
    "caution must be exercised when viewing this adaptively smoothed image since small - scale features in the diffuse emission have low statistical significance ( especially apparent wiggles in the isophotes ) .",
    "below we shall quantify the morphology of the diffuse emission using moments of the image .      before we can analyze the properties of the diffuse emission",
    "we must remove the point sources .",
    "( analysis of the properties of these sources is presented in a companion paper  @xcite . ) however , it is insufficient only to remove the sources since holes in the image still affect significantly quantities like the ellipticity that are derived from second ( or higher ) moments of the image . to obtain reliable measurements of the ellipticity and position angle throughout the source - free image it is necessary to replace",
    "each embedded source with a faithful representation of the local diffuse x - ray emission surrounding the source .",
    "we located point sources with the ciao  task wavdetect  ( a wavelet detection algorithm ) using the default parameter settings .",
    "a total of 64 sources were detected over the entire s3 field excluding the center of ngc 720 .",
    "these include the 41 sources within @xmath35 of the galaxy center discussed by @xcite .    to remove these sources and `` fill '' in the holes with diffuse emission we used the ciao  task dmfilth .",
    "this task takes as input source and background region definitions .",
    "the counts within the source regions are replaced with values sampled from the background regions . within @xmath36 of the galaxy center we defined the source extraction regions as circles of radius @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding concentric background regions all have radius @xmath38 .",
    "the average background counts in each region was determined by the polynomial method in dmfilth . since in several cases the background region of one source",
    "overlapped another ( especially within @xmath39 of the galaxy center ) we iterated runs of dmfilth  using the cleaned images of previous runs as input to subsequent runs .",
    "we found that the results converged after only three runs .    for radii larger than @xmath39 we found that dmfilthperformed well .",
    "in this context `` well '' means that the measured ellipticity and position angle are smoothly varying functions of radius ; i.e. , at the radius of a filled - in source the ellipticity and position angle do not deviate substantially from values obtained at adjacent source - free radii .",
    "unfortunately , for radii @xmath40 we found that the ellipticity and position angle did jump `` discontinuously '' near some filled - in sources , especially at the smallest radii @xmath41 where source background - region overlap ( as noted above ) is most pronounced .",
    "( note that such jumps , by accident , are not apparent for the ellipticity and position angle at the particular radii @xmath40 plotted below . )    at small radii the relative effect of the sources on derived surface brightness parameters is necessarily greater because the area of the source becomes increasingly more significant relative to @xmath42 .",
    "it is likely that at such small radii the approach of simply filling in the source region with a spatially uniform count distribution does not faithfully ( enough ) represent the shape the local diffuse emission .",
    "we defer consideration of more sophisticated source - replacement algorithms to a future study . in our analyses below we treat the region @xmath43 with caution .",
    "as should be expected , residual source - replacement effects in these inner regions are much less important for the radial profile",
    ". we shall therefore use the whole image for construction and analysis of the radial profile .",
    "the flattening of the x - ray isophotes is of central importance to our study of the flattening and concentration of the total gravitating matter in ngc 720 .",
    "the standard parameter used to denote the flattening of an individual isophote is the ellipticity , @xmath44 , where @xmath4 is the semi - major axis and @xmath45 is the semi - minor axis . however , fitting perfect ellipses to the x - ray isophotes is not necessarily justified since the isopotential surfaces generated by an elliptical mass distribution are not perfect ellipsoids .",
    "in addition , over most of the x - ray image the surface brightness of the diffuse gas is @xmath46 counts per pixel .",
    "this condition requires that relatively large areas ( in excess of a single - pixel width isophote ) must be averaged over to obtain interesting constraints on the image flattening .",
    "we quantify the image flattening using the method described by @xcite and implemented in our previous study of the _ rosat _  image of ngc 720 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this iterative method is equivalent to computing the ( two - dimensional ) principal moments of inertia within an elliptical region .",
    "the ellipticity , , is defined by the square root of the ratio of the principal moments , and the position angle , pa , is defined by the orientation of the larger principal moment . if these moments are computed within an elliptical region where the image is perfectly elliptical with constant ellipticity and orientation , then  represents a true ellipticity and pa is the true orientation of the major axis .",
    "if the image is not perfectly elliptical within this region , then  and pa are average values weighted heavily toward the edge of the region ; i.e. , provides a useful measure of image flattening which does not assume the image to be perfectly elliptical .",
    "following our previous studies we compute @xmath47 using all image pixels interior to the ellipse defined at @xmath4 ( obtained via iteration ) .",
    "we did investigate using elliptical annuli to provide a more direct measurement of the variation of  with @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , because of the low counts per pixel noted above the radial fluctuations of , pa , and centroid were considerably larger when using elliptical annuli .",
    "we estimate uncertainties on  and pa using a monte carlo procedure .",
    "the counts in each pixel are randomized assuming poisson statistics .",
    "then  and pa are computed precisely as done for the original image . after performing 100 such realizations and corresponding `` measurements '' of the image",
    "we compute the standard deviations of  and pa at each @xmath4 for the 100 runs .",
    "we take these standard deviations to be the @xmath10 errors .",
    "we have computed  and pa out to @xmath6 from the _ chandra_image such that the background - subtracted counts in each aperture increase by @xmath48 for each @xmath4 .",
    "( the edge of the s3 chip corresponds to @xmath49 . )",
    "because we use all image pixels interior to @xmath4 to compute  and pa , their values computed for a given @xmath4 are correlated with values computed at adjacent inner @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the error bars on  and pa for adjacent @xmath4 are not fully independent .",
    "but we emphasize that these quantities , being derived from second moments of the image , are weighted heavily by the pixels near @xmath4 .      in figure [ fig.compare ]",
    "we show  and pa computed from the _ chandra _  image before and after removing the point sources .",
    "( note the error bars for values computed from the image with sources are not shown for clarity but are of similar magnitude to those obtained from the source - free image . ) for the image with point sources , within @xmath50  varies wildy with @xmath4 then setlles down to @xmath51 until it declines for @xmath5 .",
    "this erratic behavior is a stark constrast to the slowly varying values of  computed from the source - free image .",
    "_ we interpret this result as a strong affirmation of our success at removing and replacing the point sources over this range in @xmath4 for the purpose of computing .",
    "_    the pa generally does not exhibit such dramatic variations with @xmath4 in either case , though the pa values computed from the image with sources ( for the most part ) systematically exceed those computed from the source - free image by @xmath52 .",
    "this relative similarity between the pas computed from the raw and source - free images coupled with the lack of strong fluctuations with @xmath4 suggest that pa is less sensitive than is  to contaminating point sources .",
    "however , with the present data we can not rule out the possibility that pa is more sensitive than  to contaminating point sources and is therefore only slightly affected by our attempt to exclude and replace the sources . since the values of  and pa are necessarily interwined , and we are confident of the success in computing , we do not believe the pa values computed from the source - free image are still substantially affected by embedded point sources .",
    "nevertheless , to be conservative we shall address below the need for dark matter in ngc 720 using  and pa separately .",
    "let us focus on the source - free image ( figure [ fig.data ] ) . as explained above in  [ src ] the best - fitting values of  and pa computed within @xmath53",
    "must be considered tentative because of residual source - replacement errors . nevertheless , certain trends in these data appear to be robust .",
    "first , for small @xmath4 we have , @xmath54 , consistent with the optical isophotes in this region within the relatively large estimated errors .",
    "second , the position angle is consistent with the optical value , @xmath55 ( n - e ) , for @xmath53 .    for @xmath56",
    "the ellipticity is consistent with a constant value , @xmath2 .",
    "this value is notably smaller than the best - fitting values of @xmath57 obtained with the _ rosat _  pspc and hri @xcite between @xmath58 ; the hri values are reproduced in figure [ fig.compare ] .",
    "the overall consistency of the  values obtained from the _ rosat _  image and _ chandra _  image with sources demonstrates that the embedded point sources are responsible for the _ rosat _  values .",
    "the most important are the group of point sources located @xmath59 to the nw of the galaxy center .",
    "these sources were not identified and removed from the _ rosat _  images ( and evaded detection from our symmetry tests because they are located near the x - ray major axis ) .",
    "note that the source - free _ chandra _  values are smaller than obtained from the hri for @xmath60 .",
    "this discrepancy is not resolved by simply degrading the _ chandra _  data by smoothing it with the hri psf .",
    "we have not definitively identified the origin of this discrepancy , but we suspect it is assocated with the different flux sensitivities of the hri and acis ; i.e. , flat spectrum point sources will be more prominent with respect to the diffuse hot gas in the acis data .",
    "the magnitude of the pa twist discovered by _ rosat _  is confirmed by the source - free _ chandra _  data , but the precise radial variation of pa is different because of the unresolved point sources present in the _ rosat _  data . for @xmath61 the position angles , @xmath62 , measured by _ chandra _",
    "are consistent with the _ rosat _  values .",
    "however , for @xmath63 the _ rosat _  hri pa jumps to a value @xmath64 whereas the source - free _ chandra _  pa increases more gradually from @xmath65 to @xmath66 for decreasing @xmath4 within @xmath67 .",
    "the similarity of the pa values obtained for the _ chandra _  image with sources and the hri demonstrate that the embedded point sources are responsible for the inflated pa values .",
    "the key point sources for these inflated pa values are located @xmath68 to the sw of the galaxy center along the minor axis ( see figure [ fig.image ] above and figure 1 of jeltema et al .",
    "2002 ) .    at large radius ( @xmath69 )  increases steadily to a value of @xmath70 while the position angle decreases to a value of @xmath71 .",
    "these changes are highly significant statistically and are obvious upon inspection of the smoothed image displayed in figure [ fig.image ] .",
    "for @xmath72 the pspc and _ chandra _  values of  agree within errors .",
    "this suggests that the effect of unresolved sources on  is less important at large radius as might be expected since the psf fwhm compared to @xmath4 decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , the pa measured by the pspc at large radius does not appear to twist so much as seen in the _ chandra _  data : pspc pa values are @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this _",
    "chandra_-_rosat _",
    "pa discrepancy at large radius is unclear , but we would tend to believe the _",
    "chandra _",
    "values because of the issue of point sources in the _ rosat _  data .",
    "it must be acknowledged , however , that since the edge of the s3 chip is at @xmath77 there could be problems with flat - fielding which we think unlikely based on our own investigations with exposure maps in this region .",
    "it is probably necessary to use the wide - field _ xmm_epic ccds to resolve this issue .",
    "the radial profile ( @xmath78 ) is the final property derived from the x - ray image that is required to constrain the shape of the gravitating matter distribution .",
    "we define the image radial profile by first summing the background - subtracted counts in concentric circular annuli with radii determined by the semi - major axes used to compute  and pa (  [ results ] ) . then dividing the counts in each annulus by the area of the annulus we arrive at the radial profile .",
    "the center of each annulus is the same and is taken to be the centroid computed within a circle of radius @xmath79 placed initially at x - ray peak .",
    "( the centroid varies by @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    ") there are @xmath82 background - subtracted counts within @xmath83 .",
    "we plot @xmath78 in figure [ fig.mod ] .",
    "the radial profile is quite smooth over the entire range investigated .",
    "the somewhat bumpy hri profile @xcite within @xmath43 can be attributed to noise and to the point sources detected in that region by _",
    "chandra_. fitting the _ chandra _  profile with a @xmath84 model yields @xmath85 and @xmath86 in agreement with the hri values .",
    "the @xmath84 model is an excellent qualitative ( i.e. , visual ) fit to @xmath78 , but because the error bars are very small the formal quality of the fit is rather poor : @xmath87 for 16 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the most important fit residuals occur in the inner bins .",
    "these residuals are small when expressed as a ratio of data to model ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) , but are relatively large when expressed in terms of a @xmath89 difference between data model .",
    "if , for example , the inner 3 bins are excluded ( @xmath90 ) we obtain @xmath91 for 13 dof .",
    "previously , we have shown that it is possible to test the hypothesis that the gravitating mass traces the stellar light using only the x - ray imaging data of the diffuse hot gas  no knowledge of the value of the gas temperature or a possible spatial temperature gradient is required @xcite .",
    "the key assumptions are that the hot gas is single - phase and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if these conditions hold , then the gas volume emissivity , , and the potential of the gravitating matter , @xmath92 , must have identical shapes in three - dimensional space ( `` x - ray shape theorem '' ) ; i.e. , _ in 3d the surfaces of constant  are surfaces of constant @xmath92 independent of the temperature profile of the gas .",
    "_ therefore , one may test the hypothesis that the 3d gravitating mass is distributed in the same way as the 3d stellar light , , obtained from deprojecting the optical image .",
    "this `` geometric test for dark matter '' compares the shapes of the isopotential surfaces computed assuming @xmath8 to the shapes of the isoemissivity surfaces of , obtained from deprojecting the x - ray image .",
    "it is important to remember that not only are the shapes of the isopotential ( and therefore isoemissivity ) surfaces sensitive to flattening of the gravitating mass , but they also reflect its radial distribution .",
    "this is illustrated by considering a multipole expansion of the potential for an arbitrary mass distribution of finite extent .",
    "near the center of the mass many high - order multipole terms may contribute resulting in a highly flattened potential in that region .",
    "as one moves away from the center the higher order terms must decay and eventually ( and usually very rapidly ) give way to the spherical monopole term .",
    "hence , an ellipticity gradient in the potential , and therefore , also probes the radial distribution of gravitating mass .",
    "this geometric test for dark matter that is distributed differently from  is also a powerful test of alternative gravity theories such as mond .",
    "the fundamental mond equation is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the newtonian force vector , @xmath95 is the mond force vector , and @xmath96 is a scalar function depending only on the ratio @xmath97  the magnitude of the mond force vector over a constant .",
    "consequently , for a given mass distribution the shapes of isopotential surfaces in mond are the same as the shapes of isopotential surfaces in newtonian theory .",
    "so if the geometric test implies dark matter using newtonian theory it follows that dark matter is also required using the mond theory .",
    "see @xcite for a more extensive discussion of the geometric test , mond , and caveats .",
    "the assumption of a single - phase gas for ngc 720 appears to be well justified .",
    "first , the _ chandra _  spectrum ( see  [ temp ] ) is consistent with an isothermal plasma .",
    "second , recent observations with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm",
    "_  have found that even the gas in cooling flow groups and clusters , systems that might have been expected to be highly multiphase , is consistent with a single - phase medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also several lines of evidence which suggest that the approximation of hydrostatic equilibrium is a good one ( see also  [ he ] ) .",
    "although it is natural to wonder whether the gas is disturbed by tidal or ram pressure effects , it must be remembered that ngc 720 is quite isolated from other large galaxies @xcite . aside from the pa twist there are no indications of external influences in the diffuse x - ray emission ; e.g. , centroids computed for the elliptical apertures in  [ results ] are all consistent within @xmath98",
    ".    we should also emphasize that the wiggles and other irregular features displayed by the smoothed x - ray isophotes in figure [ fig.image ] are not statistically significant and thus do not necessarily imply departures of the gas from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , even if those wiggles do in fact arise from real non - equilibrium motions in the gas , the hydrostatic assumption is still very likely a good one .",
    "previously , in @xcite we analyzed the x - ray isophotes of a galaxy cluster formed in an n - body / hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "it was found that relatively soon after major mergers ( i.e. , 1 - 2 crossing times ) the cluster settled down to a quasi - relaxed state where the hot gas traced approximately the shape of the gravitational potential even though the shapes of the x - ray isophotes displayed prominent irregular features .    as in our previous studies",
    "we shall assume negligible rotation of the hot gas .",
    "we expect this to be a good approximation for several reasons .",

    "this effect is undoubtedly related to existing problems in the low - energy calibration mentioned on the _ chandra _  web site .",
    "we suspect that because the diffuse gas of ngc 720 has a relatively low temperature ( @xmath146  kev ) this calibration problem is more serious for ngc 720 than hotter systems . and",
    "it is more serious for the diffuse gas than for the harder discrete sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if we exclude data below 0.7 kev then much better fits can be obtained for galactic absorption . however , there is also excess emission above the model for energies @xmath147  kev .",
    "since this excess is most pronounced in the outer annulus it is very likely associated with the background normalization .",
    "( recall that the background varied throughout the observation   [ obs ] . )",
    "to largely avoid this excess we then excluded data above 2 kev .",
    "fitting the models over 0.7 - 2 kev yields temperatures of @xmath146  kev in each annulus .",
    "since , however , we have restricted the bandwidth to such a narrow region ( which also does not enclose the energy corresponding to the best - fitting temperature ) the constraints on the spectral model are relatively weak . in particular ,",

    "these values are fully consistent with the _ rosat _  and _ asca _  values obtained in these regions @xcite    hence , the _ chandra _  data confirm that the hot gas in ngc 720 is consistent with being isothermal .",

    "in fact , we expect that even better agreement would be achieved with the _ chandra_data because romanowsky & kochanek had to try to match the larger _ rosat _  ellipticities which inhibit the ability to produce a large pa twist  a point we originally made in @xcite for ngc 720 .",
    "thus , the more gradual x - ray pa twist revealed by _",
    "chandra_provides strong evidence for a triaxial dark matter halo and lends important support to the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for @xmath0 .      to constrain the ellipticity of the dark matter halo we considered both oblate and prolate spheroidal mass models to bracket the full range of ( projected ) ellipticities of a triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "spheroidal models have the important advantage over triaxial models of being less expensive to compute .",
    "first , to complement the evidence for dark matter provided by the pa twist , we performed a `` geometric test for dark matter '' to examine whether mass distributed like the stars ( @xmath8 ) can match the observed x - ray ellipticities ( irrespective of the pa twist ) .",
    "focusing on  measured for semi - major axes @xmath219 we find that the @xmath8 hypothesis is inconsistent with the _ chandra _  ellipticities at the 96% confidence level for oblate models and at the 98% confidence level for prolate models .",
    "_ thus , both the pa twist and the ellipticities of the _ chandra _  image imply the existence of dark matter independent of the temperature profile of the gas .",
    "this evidence for dark matter can not be explained by general modified gravity theories such as mond . _",
    "second , for an assumed spheroidal model of the dark matter we generated a model x - ray image to compare the model ellipticities and radial profile to the _ chandra _  data .",
    "the dark matter density model , @xmath9 , provides the best fit to the data and gives ellipticities and @xmath10 errors of @xmath11 ( oblate ) and @xmath12 ( prolate ) .",
    "nfw and hernquist models give similar ellipticities for the dark matter .",
    "these ellipticities are less than the values of 0.44 - 0.68 ( 90% conf . ) obtained from our previous _ rosat _",
    "observations which did not account for unresolved point sources . in our previous _ rosat _  and",
    "_ asca_analysis of ngc 720 which did attempt to account for unresolved point sources assuming such sources follow the stellar light @xcite , we obtained @xmath187 ( 90% conf . )",
    "which is fully consistent with the ( source - free ) _ chandra _  values .",
    "it follows that unresolved sources remaining in the _ chandra _  image should have a negligible impact on the dark matter ellipticities determined in this paper .",
    "( this conclusion can be checked directly with a deeper _ chandra _  observation so that point sources can be detected to a lower flux limit . )",
    "the ellipticity of the dark matter inferred from the _ chandra _  data is not very different from the optical light , @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "but this does not contradict the results from the geometric test .",
    "the primary reason why the @xmath124 model can not produce the x - ray ellipticities is because @xmath125 is too centrally concentrated .",
    "consequently , the spherically symmetric monopole term dominates the stellar potential and predicts values of  that are smaller than observed , particularly for @xmath217 .",
    "the nfw and hernquist mass models do not fit nearly as well as the @xmath163 model , this discrepancy primarily arising from the radial profile in the inner regions . if the three inner bins are excluded from the fits ( i.e. , @xmath222 ) then the nfw model fits as well as the @xmath163 model .",
    "but the resulting larger scale - length of the nfw model implies that the nfw density behaves approximately as @xmath163 over the @xmath4 range fitted .",
    "so unless the mass actually consists of two components , i.e. , `` something '' plus nfw , the @xmath163 model is clearly favored .",
    "this `` something '' would have to be more centrally concentrated than the optical light ( which follows an @xmath223 law with @xmath103 ) .",
    "at large radius ( @xmath69 )  increases steadily to a value of @xmath70 while the position angle decreases to a value of @xmath71 .",
    "these changes are highly statistically significant , although ( 1 ) the fact that this region is near the edge of the ccd , and ( 2 ) the pas measured by _",
    "rosat _  and _ chandra _  in this region",
    "do not agree , suggest that an independent observation with the wide - field ccds on _ xmm _  should be used to verify the results in this region .",
    "if the _ chandra _  values for  and pa are correct in this region , then a physical interpretation is necessary .",
    "we have argued that there are several good reasons to expect that the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( see below ) .",
    "however , it is possible that the hydrostatic assumption is valid only for @xmath0 where the pa twist is consistent with the triaxial dark matter halo of @xcite ; i.e. , the divergence in pa for larger @xmath4 could signal the departure from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if the hydrostatic condition does hold for @xmath5 then there must be another , larger scale , component in the dark matter .",
    "the possibility of large - scale dark matter in ngc 720 has been suggested from analysis of its dwarf satellites by @xcite .",
    "why such a separate dark component decides to assert itself at @xmath224 is unclear .      since the evidence for dark matter in ngc 720 provided by the _ chandra _",
    "data rests primarily on the assumption that the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , here we summarize the arguments in favor of equilibrium : ( 1 ) external influences on the diffuse gas should be neglible because ngc 720 is very isolated (  [ idea ] ) , ( 2 ) other than the pa twisting , there are no notable asymmetries in the x - ray isophotes  in particular no substantial centroid shifts (  [ idea ] ) , ( 3 ) an n - body / hydrodynamical simulation suggests for a system without obvious subclustering the x - ray shape analysis should be valid (  [ idea ] ) , ( 4 ) evidence for dark matter is provided separately by  and pa (  [ triaxial ] and  [ ellipdm ] ) , ( 5 ) romanowsky & kochanek triaxial model explains pa twist within @xmath225 (  [ triaxial ] ) , and ( 6 ) the gravitating mass within @xmath204 determined from x - rays agrees with the stellar dynamical value (  [ re ] ) .    a final argument for equilibrium , at least in the central regions , is provided by the ages of the stars .",
    "@xcite estimate a relatively young age of 3 - 4  gyr for the central stellar population in ngc 720 , consistent with a fairly recent merger with a gas - rich neighbor .",
    "however , the sound crossing time of the hot gas in ngc 720 is only @xmath149  gyr indicating that the gas has had ample time to settle down since the starburst .",
    "( also , in the optical ngc 720 is classified as a `` core galaxy '' @xcite and has rounder isophotes near the center suggesting that it has not been dynamically disturbed in a long time according to the simulations of @xcite . )",
    "we conclude that for @xmath226 ( @xmath1  kpc ) that hydrostatic equilibrium is very likely to hold sufficiently well for analysis of its gravitating matter distribution .",
    "the only evidence that may suggest a recent merger is associated with properties at large radius .",
    "first , the pa twist at large radius ( @xmath227 ) can not be explained by a single triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium (  [ strange ] ) .. second , the `` arc '' of point sources at @xmath228 in ngc 720 discussed by @xcite is similar to shells seen in some elliptical galaxies which are thought to be merger remnants .",
    "the existence of dark matter in isolated elliptical galaxies has been assumed by the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for many years , but primarily because of the ambiguities associated with the analysis of stellar velocities , definitive evidence for dark matter has been lacking .",
    "chandra _",
    "observation of ngc 720 provides vital evidence that dark matter does indeed exist in an isolated elliptical galaxy .",
    "this geometric evidence for dark matter is apparently the first dynamical tracer in any stellar system that has successfully distinguished dark matter from mond ( cf .",
    "the evidence for flattened dark matter provided by the ellipticities of the _ chandra _  x - ray image of ngc 720 is inconsistent with the self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) model of @xcite .",
    "the sidm model predicts that the dark matter halo should be spherical within a radius of @xmath229  kpc in ngc 720 using the `` collisional radius '' defined by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the moderate flattening of the dark matter halo in ngc 720 is inconsistent with the highly flattened distributions predicted by the cold molecular dark matter model @xcite .",
    "the inferred ellipticity @xmath230 of the dark matter halo of ngc 720 is consistent with simulations of galaxy - scale halos in a @xmath13cdm model , but may be larger than indicated by a @xmath13wdm ( i.e. , `` warm '' dark matter ) model @xcite .",
    "these ellipticities also are similar to the small number of measurements that have been made in other types of galaxies using different methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the evidence for triaxiality provided by the x - ray pa twist is another important verification of cdm models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the _ chandra _  observation of ngc 720 has provided important evidence for flattened , triaxial dark matter in an elliptical galaxy , it is essential to apply this analysis of x - ray shapes to other galaxies ( and groups and clusters ) to determine whether the conclusions drawn from ngc 720 are representative of other systems . given the importance of detecting and removing point sources for the analysis of dark matter in ngc 720 , it is clear that _ chandra_and its @xmath231 resolution will be essential for such studies of other galaxies .",
