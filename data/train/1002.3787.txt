    "the topic i have been asked to review  the future of stellar population studies in the milky way ( mw ) and local group ( lg )  is a vast one , within which i can do no more than a whirlwind tour of various topics . to make the task more manageable",
    ", my goal will be primarily to highlight some facets of the area of _ resolved _ stellar populations that are now , and that will soon be , addressable as stellar populations work enters the  industrial age \"  an age where vast databases and automated analysis of these vast databases can be brought to bear on both newly revealed as well as age - old problems in the field .",
    "to this end , a major portion of this contribution will be to summarize those large - scale surveys about which i am aware ; i apologize in advance for any surveys i have failed to include or whose parameters i have misrepresented .",
    "before starting this whirlwind tour of the  industrial age \" of resolved lg stellar populations work , it is important to be mindful of the great advances being made in sister subdisciplines , such as cosmology , large scale structure formation , dark matter and the analysis of these matters through large numerical simulations .",
    "for example , it is now well established through such simulations ( and with growing corroboration by observations ) that the growth of structure in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe is hierarchical , with small structures merging along filaments to form larger structures , like mw - sized galaxies and lg - sized galaxy associations .",
    "but while hierarchical merging until late times ( even presently ) is now well established as a key element of cdm structure formation models , it is useful to recall that both late infall and hierarchical formation was anticipated as a central aspect of mw formation studies through the stellar populations work of searle & zinn ( 1978 ) , who showed that the outer halo globular clusters exhibit a significant age spread ( inferred through interpretation of horizontal branch morphologies ) .",
    "this foundational , early result demonstrated the power of stellar population studies for unlocking the secrets of galaxy formation .",
    "but with @xmath0cdm a now firmly entrenched and generally successful theory , it is sensible to approach future stellar population work with this context in mind , and , in part , look to stellar population studies for testing and/or refining this widely - accepted thesis .",
    "this is only possible because the advanced state of @xmath0cdm simulations allows them to make a rich variety of predictions about the structure , dynamics and chemistry of cdm structures . but",
    "checks on the theory with resolved stellar population studies are all the more important because , while @xmath0cdm has enjoyed great success in matching observations of structures on the largest scales , several problems still remain in matching the theory to observations on galaxy scales . among these problems on small scales",
    "are ( 1 ) the  missing satellites problem \" , where the models predict a mass spectrum of galaxy subhalos that are strongly in disagreement with that observed around the mw ( e.g. , klypin et al . 1999 ) ; ( 2 ) the  central cusps problem \" , where @xmath0cdm predicts the mass density of galaxies to have steeply rising central cusps ( e.g. , navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) for which there is little observational evidence in the mw ( see , e.g. , merrifield 2005 ) and which is belied by the flat central density profiles of dwarf galaxies ; and ( 3 ) problems with the predicted angular momentum distributions in galaxies , wherein the models have difficulty making large , extended disks like that of the mw ( e.g. , abadi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "thus , a current focus for advancing @xmath0cdm theory is attempting to resolve problems on galaxy scales , and clearly there are potent avenues by which stellar populations work in the lg , mw and their satellite systems can contribute not only to progress in understanding hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution , obviously , but also to fine - tuning @xmath0cdm theory .",
    "as one example of how stellar population studies can contribute to fine - tuning @xmath0cdm theory , take the notion of infall along filaments , one of the elements of hierachical galaxy formation vividly seen in the simulations as well as in the observed distribution of galaxies on large scales .",
    "is this something we can find evidence for in the lg ?",
    "infall of dm subhalos along filaments should leave rather specific dynamical fingerprints in terms of preferred shapes , orientations and coincidences of orbits of lg systems and mw satellites , accreted globular clusters and ( halo ) stars ( e.g. , knebe et al .",
    "it has long been known that most of the  classical \" mw satellites show a relatively strong planar alignment ( e.g. , kunkel & demers 1976 , kunkel 1979 , lynden - bell 1976 , 1982 , majewski 1994 , fusi pecci et al .",
    "1995 , metz et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a ) almost perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this preferential spatial distribution holds up statistically even with the inclusion of the new  ultrafaint \" satellites revealed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and when the orientation of the sdss  footprint - bias \" ( i.e. , towards the north galactic cap ) is accounted for ( metz et al .",
    "such spatial alignments could be a signature of a dynamical association of the satellites , but must be checked with full 3-dimensional velocity measurements for the satellites . through painstaking work ,",
    "the proper motions , @xmath1 , of mw satellites are slowly being accumulated , though in most cases with still only marginally significant @xmath2 , at least for ground - based data ( see summary in metz et al .",
    "more recently , proper motions measured using hubble space telescope imaging of the magellanic clouds ( `` mcs '' hereafter ; kallivayalil et al . 2006a , b , piatek et al . 2008 ) , other dsph satellites ( piatek et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ) and globular clusters ( e.g. , bedin et al .",
    "2006 , kalirai et al .",
    "2007 ) have shown significantly reduced proper motion uncertainties , despite very small time baselines  with improvements to be expected if more epochs can be accumulated with the newly - installed wfc3 .",
    "analysis of the proper motions of these mw satellites has more or less supported the notion of dynamical kinship of at least some satellites , at least in that a number of these systems seem to share similar orbital poles , showing common directions of angular momentum ( majewski et al .",
    "1996 , palma et al .",
    "2002 , metz et al .",
    "the meaning of such alignments and whether they are at odds with , or consistent with , expectations of typical satellite configurations around mw - like galaxies in cdm models has been much debated of late . among the postulated theories , such dynamical correlations could reflect siblinghood among satellites : ( 1 ) through the break - up of once large satellites  e.g. , a greater magellanic or fornax system ( kunkel 1979 , lynden - bell 1982 , majewski 1994 , metz et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( 2 ) through the formation of satellites as tidal dwarfs ( e.g. , kroupa et al .",
    "2005 ) ; ( 3 ) through the infall of satellites onto the mw in groups ( li & helmi 2008 , donghia & lake 2008 , metz et al .",
    "2009b ) ; or ( 4 ) through the preferential infall of satellites along cdm filaments ( kang et al .",
    "2005 , zentner et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "according to the simulations , the surviving galaxies of today reflect the most recent infall onto the mw  of subhalos now in the mw , those in current satellites were the most distant subhalos at earlier times . earlier material to fall in came from initially closer matter and",
    "is now spread out among the star and star cluster debris of the halo .",
    "thus , comparing the orbits of the satellites to the orbits of halo stars is a comparison of how infall proceeded at these different epochs , and this translates to spatial variations in the dynamics . according to high - resolution numerical simulations ( e.g. , diemand et al . 2005 )",
    "the outermost galactic halo stars and globular clusters should be on radially biased orbits while the inner regions should contain more isotropic orbits .",
    "the predicted kinematics for the late - infalling satellite dwarf galaxies is different , with small anisotropies even in the outer parts .",
    "in addition , the net angular momentum of these components is expected to be small and simply reflect that of the dominant dark matter component at this epoch .    to test such predictions",
    "requires measures of halo star and satellite orbital anisotropy ; these should be done _ in situ _ to avoid orbital biases attendant with solar neighborhood samples .",
    "( to this end , it is interesting to note the much more complex inner / outer halo structure suggested by recent analysis of the sdss segue stellar sample with proper motions by carollo et al .",
    "2007 , including the suggestion that the outer halo dominates the _ low _ eccentricity component of their relatively nearby stellar sample . )",
    "this , in turn , requires the measurement of not only the bulk proper motions of the mw satellites , but the much more demanding star - by - star measures of _ distant _ , individual halo stars .",

    "table 1 gives a sampling of astrometric capabilities ( quoted as  mission end \" positional accuracies for the surveys and  achieved / achievable \" accuracies for the pointed instruments _ at the magnitude limited given _ ) either already underway or expected in the next decade ( with table values taken from the project websites or published papers ) .",
    "the projects include large ground - based surveys that probe deeply but at lower relative precision ( usno b1.0 , ucac2 and the future pan - starrs and lsst astrometry ) as well as more focused ground - based facilities that can obtain higher precision  for example vlba observations of radio sources ( such as masers ) and the soon - to - be - commissioned one degree imager on the wiyn telescope , with its orthogonal transfer arrays capable of on - chip local corrections for atmosphere - induced , differential image wander . but upcoming space - based astrometric missions  including j - maps ( which will provide a new epoch of positions that can be matched to those from hipparcos and tycho ) , jasmine ( a mission to do infrared astrometry of the galactic bulge ) , gaia and sim - lite",
    " will revolutionize the field of galactic kinematics with astrometry reaching to microarcsecond precision ( sim - lite in narrow angle mode ) .",
    "these capabilities will enable us to achieve the scientific goals outlined above , considering that to derive transverse velocities of 10 km s@xmath15 accuracy for mw satellites at @xmath13100 kpc requires @xmath1320",
    "@xmath1as yr@xmath15 proper motions .",
    "this is within range of sim - lite for individual stars and for gaia after the averaging of the proper motions for many @xmath16@xmath13@xmath17 giant stars in each satellite .",
    "however , only sim - lite will be able to measure the proper motions of satellites like leo i , leo ii or canven i , which are beyond 200 kpc and have their brightest members at @xmath16@xmath13@xmath18 .",
    "moreover , only sim - lite will be able to measure precise proper motions for many of the newfound ultrafaint dsphs , which , even though at closer distances , have a paucity of bright giant stars . obviously , for single stars , where one can not take advantage of averaging , the problem is more acute , but gaia will give an unparalleled view of the dynamics of inner halo stars , with sim - lite providing _ in situ _ measures of stars in the outer halo .",
    "sim - lite , along with vlba astrometry on the few lg galaxies with detectable masers ( like ic10 and m33 ) , will allow the orbits of galaxies within the lg and beyond to be derived .",
    "this will make it possible to constrain the matter distribution over mpc scales and test cosmological expectations such as infall along filaments ( shaya et al .",
    "there have been some tantalizing suggestions of late lg infall by the discovery of some  hypervelocity dwarf galaxies \" near m31 , namely and xii and and xiv .",
    "given most reasonable estimates for the m31 mass , these systems have radial velocities suggesting that the dwarfs are not presently bound to m31 or even the lg ( majewski et al .",
    "2007 , chapman et al . 2007 ) ; m31 would need to be at least two times more massive than previously thought to keep these satellites bound to it .",
    "meanwhile , analysis of the hst - based proper motions of the mcs ( see above ) by besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) strongly suggests that these galaxies are making their first pass around the mw , which implies that they are among the latest hierarchical accumulations of matter by the mw .",
    "of course , the mcs are dirr type systems , and it is interesting that their hyperbolic orbits are consistent with the overall distributions of dwarf satellites of different types within the lg : it is well known that there is a general density - morphology relationship within the lg , with dsph and de galaxies mostly clustered around m31 and the mw , while most dirr galaxies  the mcs among the notable and nettlesome exceptions  are typically found in isolated regions of the lg .",
    "but the new mc orbital data suggest ( 1 ) that the mcs violate the density - morphology relationship by being near the mw _ now _ due to a coincidence of fortuitous timing in the dynamical evolution of the mcs and the lg , and ( 2 ) that the mcs may be on the first stages of transformation from a dirr morphology to another class of dwarf system .",
    "such evolution of the morphologies of lg dwarf galaxies should be reflected in the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of these systems . through systematic high resolution imaging",
    " especially with the hubble space telescope  combined with stellar population synthesis , the sfhs of these lg dwarf galaxies are being painstakingly assembled ( e.g. , see summary in dolphin et al .",
    "this work shows clear differences in the sfhs among nearby dwarf galaxies , with a clear morphology - density - sfh relation that strongly demonstrates how environment is a major driver in the evolution of small galaxies .",
    "this may occur through the tidal shocking of more frequent gravitational encounters with the large lg spirals that accelerates star formation by fostering bursts and leading to an earlier exhaustion of gas , or it may relate to this gas being stripped out by ram pressure interaction with hot coronal gas around the large systems .",
    "the morphology - density - sfh relation also suggests the possibility , long discussed , that dsph galaxies and dirrs may be evolutionarily related .",
    "such a connection is made via @xmath19-body simulations ( e.g. , mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b , klimentowski et al . 2009 ) that show _ tidal stirring _ to be an active agent transforming late type morphologies  e.g. , high surface brightness dwarf disks  into dsph or de - like systems when placed inside a mw - sized halo .",
    "this process involves the formation and subsequent buckling of bars in the evolving dwarf , which transforms it from a rotation to pressure - supported system . in this regard",
    "it is interesting that the large mc ( and possibly the small mc ) contains a bar .",
    "if , as these models suggest , dirrs are simply systems that havent yet been dynamically stirred , then the lg dirrs should be on very large lg orbits , or they may be the most recent infalling systems into the lg and onto the large lg spirals ( as e.g. , the mcs ) ; thus dirrs may represent the most  pristine \" of luminous subhalos . but much work remains to verify this picture , especially given the arguments made by , e.g. , grebel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that the central surface brightness - luminosity and luminosity - metallicity distributions of dwarf galaxies do not favor an evolutionary connection between dirrs and dsphs , but rather a closer evolutionary connection between dsphs and  transitional \" type dwarfs ( like the antlia , phoenix and lgs3 systems )  a connection that , nevertheless , still belies environment ( i.e. , tidal forces ) driving the differential evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "( on the other hand , brown et al .",
    "2007 show that the dirr leo a is similar to dsphs in having a large velocity dispersion and @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 in solar units . )    clearly , more stellar populations work  in particular , ever deeper hst cmds on the lg dirrs  could help resolve these questions of dwarf evolution .",
    "the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ( angst ) project is a great help in this regard , taking this detailed cmd work out to 4 mpc ( dalcanton et al .",
    "2009 ) . with the advent of ever larger telescopes , as well as more efficient instruments on existing 10-m class telescopes",
    ", we also have the promise in the coming decade of detailed chemistry of individual stars in these systems , as is now being done on the closer , lg dsphs ( see  7 ) . of course",
    ", more accurate information on the orbits of these systems , and understanding better the overall dynamics of the lg , would be extremely helpful in probing the evolutionary history of dwarf galaxies , beyond the tantalizing example offered by the mcs (  3 ) .",
    "of course , another prediction of cdm models is that infalling subhalos onto mw - like systems , which continue to the present , will face dynamical shredding and create a web of luminous ( and dark ) streams around these systems ( e.g. , bullock & johnston 2005 ) .",
    "this vision of a mw halo networked by streams has been hinted at for several decades by small , pointed pencil - beam surveys  with the conclusion that the _ entire _ halo is made from accreted systems ( see , e.g. , majewski 1993 , 2004 , majewski et al .",
    "1996 ) . but",
    "this vision of the mw really has been born out by deep , wide - field photometric surveys like the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) which have enabled the construction of large portraits of the halo where many of these streams can be seen plainly ( e.g. , newberg et al .",
    "2002 , majewski et al .",
    "2003 , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 , grillmair 2006 )",
    ". continued active mining of these data bases continues to unveil not only new tidal debris streams ( e.g. , rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2004 , sharma et al .",
    "2009 for 2mass , and belokurov et al . 2007b , grillmair 2009 , newberg et al .",
    "2009 for sdss , to name just some examples ) , but of course a plethora of new dsph galaxies of extremely low luminosity ( e.g. , willman et al . 2005 , zucker et al .",
    "2006 , belokurov et al .",
    "2007a , irwin et al .",
    "2007 , grillmair 2009 ) .",
    "these ultrafaint dsphs tend to have very high @xmath20 ratios ( muoz et al .",
    "2006b , simon & geha 2007 ) that point to a common dsph mass scale ( strigari et al .",
    "2008 ) , which may arise from some critical scale in the formation of galaxies or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dm .",
    "but a few ultrafaints show evidence for tidal disruption and dynamical instability ( e.g. , coleman et al . 2007 , carlin et al . 2009 ) and may represent exceptions to the common mass scale ( adn et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    ".wide field photometric surveys past and future [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     significant advances in the understanding of the chemical evolution of our galaxy and its network of disrupted dsphs can be expected in the next decade , where huge databases of medium to high resolution spectroscopy of galactic stars will be generated with a variety of instruments ( table 3 ) .",
    "obviously , the accumulation of high quality radial velocities for many millions of stars will also shape a very detailed understanding of the dynamics of galactic stellar populations .",
    "not only will the galactic halo and its substructure be thoroughly probed by these upcoming surveys , but so too will the populations of the inner galaxy  including those typically hidden by dust obscuration  by infrared spectroscopic surveys like apogee ( see schiavon et al .",
    ", this proceedings ) .",
    "of course , @xmath0cdm surveys show galaxies forming _ entirely _ from hierarchical merging in an  inside - out \" manner , so detailed studies of the inner mw are essential to unlocking the dust - concealed story of its early formation . because of this dust obscuration , explorations at infrared wavelengths hold the most promise for this work .",
    "fortunately , the coming decade brings a host of new infrared capabilities to add to the near - infrared ( nir ) imaging brought by 2mass and other more focused surveys . the ukidss project ( lucas et al . 2008 ) will increase the depth of these nir imaging probes at low galactic latitudes , and also provide second epoch positional data that can be combined with 2mass for proper motions ( e.g. , deacon et al . 2009 ) .",
    "a more focused effort of @xmath22-band astrometry of the galactic disk and bulge is the goal of the japan astrometry satellite mission for infrared exploration ( jasmine ; gouda et al .",
    ".    the spitzer space telescope , which has significantly opened up longer wavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of the inner mw , will continue to provide longer wavelength imaging capability even as it enters its more wavelength - limited , warm mission .",
    "in particular , the infrared array camera ( irac ) will continue to map the galactic midplane at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 m through the glimpse-360 mission , extending the earlier glimpse i and ii projects ( churchwell et al .",
    "2009 ) , which have been instrumental in uncovering the structure of the central galaxy ( e.g. , benjamin et al .",
    "even more coverage ( wavelength and area ) will be given by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , to be launched in the autumn of 2009 . and",
    "apogee will provide high resolution nir spectroscopy of stars otherwise inaccessible behind tens of magnitudes of optical extinction .    despite the diminished effects of infrared studies to the presence of dust",
    ", it can not be completely ignored . continued efforts must be made to understand the galactic extinction law , especially given that it is not universal either by ism density or by position in the galaxy ( e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 2009 , zasowski et al .",
    "2009 , gao et al .",
    "fortunately , the combination of nir and mir photometry ( e.g. , 2mass / ukidss + glimpse / wise ) gives direct information on the reddening foreground to each star , which will make it possible in the future to develop maps not only of the 3-d distribution of stars in the galactic disk , but also of the dust ( zasowski et al .",
