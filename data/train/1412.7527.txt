    "a straight forward verification which class @xmath166 yields optimal packing can be proposed for a fixed @xmath32 .",
    "first , for clarity consider 1d case . then there exists exactly one class of graph @xmath240 including the regular 1d lattice @xmath241 . a graph from @xmath240 consists of sequentially located edges along the axis .",
    "it follows from the system that each point @xmath242 lies in the middle of the segment @xmath243 that immediately implies the points @xmath242 form the lattice @xmath241 .",
    "the following extension of the above scheme to @xmath0 can be proposed .",
    "let @xmath244 denote the @xmath13th coordinate of the point @xmath35 ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "all the points @xmath244 ( @xmath69 ) are located on the real axis @xmath246 ( coincidence is permitted ) and satisfy the system @xmath247 where @xmath248 denotes the @xmath13th coordinate of the basic vector @xmath249 .",
    "the class of graphs @xmath166 determines the sets @xmath70 , i.e. , connections between the points @xmath244 and @xmath190 .",
    "in particular , @xmath166 determines @xmath250 restricted by the kissing number .",
    "it is important to solve the system keeping the parameters @xmath248 in symbolic form .",
    "it can be done by separate numerical solutions to the systems @xmath251 and by the linear combination @xmath252 all the computations can be made separately for @xmath245 . as a result",
    "we obtain expressions for the optimal @xmath35 in the class @xmath166 @xmath253 where the vectors @xmath254 are given numerically .",
    "the next numerical problem consists in determinations of such bases @xmath255 which possess @xmath127 percolation chains connecting the opposite faces of the parallelotope @xmath59 .",
    "ultimately , one has to perform this procedure for all the classes of graphs and take the best packing .",

    "we do not discuss the case of different radii .",
    "we suppose that a similar work can be done , since simple formulae for @xmath145 are known @xcite , @xcite and can be extended to @xmath0 following sec.[sec3 ] .",
