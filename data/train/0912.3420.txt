    "landau s fermi liquid theory @xcite can be considered as the `` standard theory '' of solid state physics .",
    "it predicts that the electronic properties of a ( normal ) metal follow , in the presence of coulomb correlations , a renormalized ( quasiparticle ) version of those for non - interacting electrons . among the most fundamental physical properties",
    "is the heat capacity which , at low temperatures , is predominated by the electronic degrees of freedom . for a normal metal ,",
    "landau s fermi liquid theory @xcite predicts a linear increase of the specific heat capacity with temperature @xmath0 and a cubic term , more precisely a term @xmath1 , as the leading correction @xcite . for free electrons ,",
    "the prefactor @xmath2 is directly proportional to the electronic density of states at the fermi level since , due to the pauli principle , only these electrons contribute . in the case of a fermi liquid",
    ", we merely need to introduce a quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath3 to account for the coulomb interaction , which enhances the specific heat of a correlated metal by @xmath4 .",
    "however , this electronic contribution prevails only at temperatures much lower than the debye temperature .",
    "otherwise the cubic phononic term , which has a much higher prefactor because of its bosonic nature , dominates .",
    "as we have shown in a recent letter @xcite , this longstanding conception needs to be supplemented : for strongly correlated electrons , a clear kink in the temperature dependence of the specific heat appears , marking the abrupt change from one linear behavior to a second one with a reduced slope at higher temperatures .",
    "this can be shown numerically solving the hubbard model @xcite within dynamical mean field theory @xcite , using exact diagonalization as an impurity solver .",
    "quantitatively the same results can also been obtained analytically , following the derivation by abrikosov _",
    "@xcite for the specific heat , taking the recently observed kinks in the self energy as a starting point @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of these theoretical results is somewhat problematic since typically , at the kink temperature , the phononic contribution to the specific heat is already dominating .",
    "an exception in this respect is liv@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite , the first heavy fermion system with @xmath7-electrons , since the kink temperature is here particularly low . and ,",
    "indeed , the precise inspection of the experimental data shows a kink in the correct temperature range @xcite . in this proceeding",
    ", we will review the previous theoretical results and include additional data .",
    "in the presence of strong electronic correlations , the @xmath8-integrated spectral function @xmath9 shows a typical three peak structure with a lower and an upper hubbard band and a quasiparticle peak in between . using the dmft formula @xmath10 which relates green function and self energy at frequency @xmath11 , one can show @xcite that such a strongly correlated three peak structure necessarily entails a kink .",
    "note that the hybridization function @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmacontributions ] ) is for a simple semi - circular density of states just @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : half the bandwidth ) . for other lattices , @xmath12 depends on the moments of the non - interacting density of states with a similar term proportional @xmath15 dominating .",
    "the kink argument is now as follows @xcite : the first three terms of the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmacontributions ] ) yield an almost linear frequency dependence for the real part of the self energy over the entire region of the central quasiparticle peak .",
    "the derivative hence gives a quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath16^{-1}\\label{eq : z}\\ ] ]    the last ( hybridization ) term however yields an additional contribution to @xmath17 which basically is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "this real part can be directly obtained from the spectral function of the central quasiparticle peak @xmath19 via a kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "_ inside _ the overall width of the quasiparticle peak , there is a turning point in @xmath9 .",
    "hence , @xmath18 has a linear frequency dependence up to an maximum at the turning point @xmath9 .",
    "after this maximum changes in @xmath18 are minor .",
    "altogether this means that at low frequencies we have to add the slope obtained from the @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) yielding an altogether smaller fermi liquid renormalization factor @xmath20 at low energies . in between the two regimes",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 , there is a kink at a frequency @xmath22 . in summary",
    "we hence have : @xmath23 with the constant @xmath24 providing for a continuous function .",
    "before we turn to the specific heat in the next section , let us note that the kink in the self energy directly leads to a kink in the energy - momentum dispersion relation of the correlated electrons .",
    "let us also remark here , that the result of generic kinks in the self energy of strongly correlated systems should be robust beyond dmft , as similar effects are to be expected in cluster @xcite and diagrammatic extensions @xcite of dmft .",
    "based on eq .  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , we have developed an analytical theory for the specific heat on the basis of a formula by abrikosov , gorkov and dzyaloshinski ( agd ) for the entropy of a fermionic system at low temperatures@xcite : @xmath25 , \\label{eq : abr2}\\ ] ] this agd formula is ( through a low - temperature diagrammatic expansion ) based on the low frequency behavior of the self energy @xmath26 at zero temperature [ or the corresponding retarded and advanced green function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : abr2 ] ) ] so that we can directly apply it with @xmath26 from eq .",

    "( [ eq : final ] ) allows us to calculate the specific heat through a simple integral .",
    "if vice versa , the specific heat is known , e.g. , experimentally , we can employ eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) as a fit formula for obtaining @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath22 .",
    "the latter ( fit formula ) approach had been taken for the experimental validation of the specific heat kinks in liv@xmath5o@xmath6 since lda+dmft calculations @xcite for liv@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite could not provide for a fine enough resolution of the low frequency dependence of the self energy , even when using the projective quantum monte carlo method @xcite which is most appropriate for this purpose . as fig .",
    "3 of @xcite shows the three fitting parameters provide for an excellent agreement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) and the specific heat of @xcite , including a clearly visible _ kink_. let us note that we did not subtract a phonon contribution for the specific heat since ( i ) it does not alter the existence or non - existence of a kink , ( ii ) it is still an order of magnitude smaller than the electronic contribution at the kink temperature and ( iii ) there is a considerable arbitrariness depending on the reference system chosen .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows results of our final equation ( [ eq : final ] ) applied to the hubbard model with a semi - circular density of states with half bandwidth @xmath37 . as an input to eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath22 have been fitted to the numerical renormalization data for the dmft self energy from ref .",
    "besides , we have also calculated the dmft specific heat directly , using exact diagonalization ( ed ) with 7 levels in the impurity bath .",
    "both results agree very well , and the minor deviations can be attributed to the numerical inaccuracy of the exact diagonalization study for which @xmath38 had to be obtained via a numerical differentiation of the total energy .    in the inset , we show the specific heat over a slightly extended temperature range .",
    "as the quasiparticle peak eventually ends , the specific heat has a maximum after the kink temperature .",
    "note that this maximum is not contained in our formula ( [ eq : final ] ) since it would require an extension of the self energy description eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) to higher energies where @xmath17 has a maximum at the frequencies between hubbard and quasiparticle bands and @xmath39 becomes important .",

    "recent experiments on liv@xmath5o@xmath6 , an ideal material for studying the electronic specific heat , confirm our theory .",
