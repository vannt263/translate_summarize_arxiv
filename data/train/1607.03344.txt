    "as a new mobile network architecture consisting of remote radio heads ( rrhs ) and baseband units ( bbus ) , cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) can deal with large - scale control / data processing much more efficiently .",
    "the rationale behind this is that baseband processing is centralized and coordinated among sites in the centralized bbu pool , which reduces the capital expenditure ( capex ) and operating expenditure ( opex ) of the networks  @xcite .",
    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) is another key technology that promises outstanding spectral efficiency ( se ) and energy efficiency ( ee ) . in massive mimo antenna systems , base stations ( bss )",
    "are equipped with large antenna arrays to support a large number of users in the same time - frequency domain  @xcite . among other emerging technologies such as device - to - device communications , full duplex radios , and millimeter wave , etc .",
    ", c - ran and massive mimo are identified as promising 5 g technologies  @xcite .    driven by its high se and ee ,",
    "c - ran has recently received tremendous attention from both industry and academia  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a group of single - antenna rrhs were considered to form a distributed antenna array , and two downlink transmission strategies namely best rrh selection and distributed beamforming were examined in terms of outage probability in @xcite .",
    "most recently in @xcite , user - centric association in a multi - tier c - ran was proposed , in which the rrh that had the best signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was scheduled to serve the user .",
    "compared to @xcite , downlink transmission in the c - ran with a group of multi - antenna rrhs was investigated in @xcite . in the work of @xcite , maximal ratio transmission and transmit antenna selection were adopted at the rrhs , and the outage probability was derived by considering several transmission schemes such as rrh selection and distributed beamforming .",
    "heterogeneous c - ran is a new paradigm by integrating cloud computing with heterogeneous networks ( hetnets )  @xcite . in heterogeneous c - ran ,",
    "severe inter - tier interference is coordinated for the enhancement of se and ee .",
    "the architecture of heterogenous c - ran with massive mimo is envisioned as an appealing solution , since none of these techniques can solely achieve the 5 g targets  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the opportunities and challenges for heterogenous c - ran with massive mimo were discussed , and it was mentioned that the proper densities of the massive mimo macrocell bss ( mbss ) and rrhs in the networks should be addressed . while the significance of heterogenous c - ran with massive mimo has been highlighted in the prior works  @xcite , more research efforts should be devoted to proper characterization of this combination .    although c - ran can effectively mitigate the inter - rrh interference by using interference management techniques such as coordinated multi - point ( comp ) , the inter - tier interference between the rrhs and mbss may be problematic in the heterogeneous c - ran , due to the limited radio resources .",
    "soft fractional frequency reuse ( s - ffr ) is viewed as an efficient inter - tier interference coordination approach . in @xcite , s - ffr",
    "was considered in the heterogeneous c - ran to both mitigate the inter - tier interference and enhance the spectrum efficiency .",
    "recent developments have showed physical layer security as an innovative solution for safeguarding wireless networks .",
    "the rationale behind this is to exploit the randomness inherent in wireless channels such as fading or artificial noise , etc . in order to transmit information confidentially  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to traditional cryptographic approaches , physical layer security based techniques do not rely on computational complexity and have very good scalability  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of massive mimo also introduces new opportunities for providing physical layer security , e.g. ,  @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , matched filter precoding and artificial noise generation were considered to secure downlink transmission in a multicell massive mimo system in the presence of an eavesdropper . subsequently in  @xcite , passive eavesdropping and active attacks were investigated in massive mimo systems with physical layer security , which illustrates that passive eavesdropping has little effect on the secrecy capacity for the case of considering only one single - antenna eavesdropper . while these recent contributions certainly laid a solid foundation in massive mimo systems with physical layer security , such a research area is still far from being well understood .",
    "the research on physical layer security in the c - ran is also in its infancy , and we believe it is a new highly rewarding candidate for physical layer security due to at least the following two crucial factors :    * low - power rrhs are densely placed in c - ran  @xcite so the distance between user and its serving rrh is short , which decreases the risk of information leakage . * the inter - rrh interference is mitigated in the c - ran .",
    "as such , all other rrhs can act as `` friendly jammers '' to confound the eavesdroppers  @xcite .",
    "thus , massive mimo and c - ran offer a wealth of opportunities at the physical layer to secure communication .    motivated by the aforementioned background , in this paper",
    ", we explore the benefits of massive mimo aided heterogeneous c - ran by investigating its secrecy and ee performance .",
    "we consider downlink transmission in a two - tier heterogeneous c - ran , in which the rrhs co - exist with the massive mimo aided macrocells . to control the inter - tier interference to an acceptable level , s - ffr is used to allocate the radio resources appropriately .",
    "different from @xcite , in this paper , the rrhs and massive mimo mbss are spatially distributed under the framework of stochastic geometry .",
    "while @xcite considered only one single user in the network with multiple rrhs around the user coverage area and evaluated the performance from the standpoint of the user , we analyze the secrecy and ee of the entire network . in summary ,",
    "our contributions are that :    * we provide a tractable analytical framework to characterize the secrecy and ee performance of heterogeneous c - ran aided by massive mimo .",
    "our analysis accounts for the key features of massive mimo and c - ran , i.e. , large antenna arrays and simultaneously serving multiple users for massive mimo , and large numbers of rrhs and inter - rrh interference mitigation for c - ran .",
    "* we also study the area ergodic secrecy rate and secrecy outage probability in this network .",
    "our results illustrate that accommodating more users by the massive mimo empowered mbss increases the area ergodic secrecy rate and decreases the secrecy outage probability , while it has negligible effect on the rrh s performance .",
    "deploying large numbers of rrhs increases the area ergodic secrecy rate and decreases the secrecy outage probability . * in addition , our results demonstrate that the effect of s - ffr on the area ergodic secrecy rate of the network can be distinct depending on the rrh density .",
    "moreover , the ee of the rrh tier linearly increases with their dedicated radio resources , and the network ee is improved by using more rrhs and more radio resources to be allocated to the rrhs .",
    "as shown in fig . [ hcns_stochastic ] , we consider the downlink of a two - tier heterogeneous c - ran , where the bbu pool in the cloud is established to coordinate the entire network .",
    "massive mimo enabled mbss of the first tier , as high power nodes ( hpns ) , are connected with the bbu pool via backhaul link , while the rrhs of the second tier , as low power nodes ( lpns ) , are connected with the bbu pool via fronthaul link ( optical fibre link ) . in this model , we have eavesdroppers ( eves ) passively intercepting the secrecy messages without any active attacks .",
    "the locations of eves are modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) @xmath0 with density @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the locations of mbss are modeled as an independent hppp @xmath2 with density @xmath3 , and we model the locations of rrhs by an independent hppp @xmath4 with density @xmath5 .    equipped with @xmath6 antennas , each mbs uses zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) to communicate with @xmath7 single - antenna users over the same resource block ( rb ) ( @xmath8 ) using equal power assignment .",
    "the zfbf matrix at a mbs is @xmath9 with the channel matrix @xmath10  @xcite , where @xmath11 denotes the hermitian transpose .",
    "each rrh is equipped with a single - antenna and serves a single - antenna user over one rb .",
    "all channels are assumed to undergo independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) quasi - static rayleigh block fading .",
    "further , each user is assumed to be connected with its nearest bs such that the euclidean plane is divided into poisson - voronoi cells .",
    "we consider the adoption of s - ffr for inter - tier interference mitigation and assume that there are a total of @xmath12 rbs , the number of rbs allocated to rrhs is @xmath13 , and the number of rbs shared by rrhs and mbss is @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 denotes the s - ffr factor , with @xmath16 . since inter - rrh interference can be efficiently mitigated via cooperation among rrhs , same radio resources can be shared among the rrhs in the c - ran  @xcite . for rrh transmission over the @xmath17-th rb allocated to rrhs , the receive signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at a typical user can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rrh transmit power allocated to each rb , @xmath20 is the bandwidth per rb , @xmath21 is the small - scale fading channel power gain , @xmath22 is a frequency dependent constant value , which is typically set as @xmath23 with @xmath24 and the carrier frequency @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the pathloss exponent , @xmath27 denotes the distance between the typical user and its typical serving rrh , and @xmath28 is the power spectrum density of the noise and the weak inter - rrh interference . for rrh transmission over the @xmath29-th rb shared by the rrhs and mbss , the receive sinr at a typical user",
