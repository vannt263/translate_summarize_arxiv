    "electron - electron interactions in disordered mesoscopic metals are not very well understood .",

    "indeed , it is well known@xcite that the coulomb interaction between electrons can be obtained by integrating the exponential of the coupled maxwell - matter action over the fluctuating quantum electric and magnetic fields .",
    "however , in a path integral approach we may also perform the integrations in a different order .",

    "our rather unconventional derivation of the interaction correction to the equilibrium current makes the connection between electron - electron interactions and non - linear response manifest .",
    "in fact , from our derivation it is clear that the fock contribution ( [ eq : if ] ) to the equilibrium current is closely related to the non - equilibrium current given in eq.([eq : inedef ] ) .",
    "physically our hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath89 can be identified with the scalar potential of electromagnetism , which is generated self - consistently by the motion of the electrons@xcite .",
    "therefore the negative gradient of our auxiliary potential @xmath106 is the effective force acting on the electrons , which in turn can be associated with an internal electric field @xmath107 , @xmath108 defining @xmath109 and using eq.([eq : vrt ] ) , we have @xmath110 , or @xmath111 where @xmath112 . from eq.([eq : v2av ] ) we thus conclude @xmath113 so that the fock contribution ( [ eq : if ] ) to the equilibrium current can be written as @xmath114 where the non - linear conductivity @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 note that functional averaging restores translational invariance in time , so that the average in eq.([eq : ifrewrite ] ) is proportional to @xmath117 .",

    "clearly , the corresponding non - linear response function @xmath118 is a system property that should be independent of the origin of the electric fields . in particular , if we add an external electric field , eq.([eq : ifrewrite ] ) is still valid provided we identify @xmath119 with the total electric field .",
    "thus , after performing in eq.([eq : sigmanldef ] ) the usual analytic continuation , @xmath120 , we conclude that the non - linear conductivity @xmath4 defined in eq.([eq : inedef ] ) can be identified with @xmath121 recall that @xmath4 describes the _ time - independent _ part of the non - equilibrium current that is proportional to the intensity of a _ time - dependent _ , spatially uniform electric field .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "the first concerns the analytic continuation of the imaginary frequency response to real frequencies . because eq.([eq : sigmanldef ] ) relates a non - linear response function to the flux - derivative of a linear response function ( the polarization )",
    ", we may rely on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to relate real and imaginary time response .",
    "of course , eq.([eq : sigmanldef ] ) can also be obtained with the help of the identity ( [ eq : identity1 ] ) from the expression ( [ eq : k2 ] ) for the general non - linear response function @xmath122 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that quite generally the correct real frequency response can be obtained by replacing @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 for all frequencies@xcite .",
    "secondly , we would like to emphasize that so far we have not averaged over the disorder potential , i.e. all equations given above are valid for an arbitrary realization of @xmath14 . in the following subsection",
    "we shall start from eq.([eq : sigma2iden ] ) to perform the disorder average of the non - linear conductivity .",
    "this has the advantage that we only need to average a product of _ two _ green s functions .",
    "note that in the work @xcite the average of the non - linear conductivity has been calculated directly from eqs.([eq : j2 ] ) and ( [ eq : k2 ] ) . because the latter expression involves a product of _ three _ green s function , it is in this case more difficult to identify the dominant disorder diagrams .",
    "one difficulty , which apparently has not been noticed in ref.@xcite , lies in the fact that at long wavelengths and small frequencies density - vertices are renormalized by singular vertex corrections involving so - called diffuson propagators@xcite this might partially explain the discrepancies between the result of kravtsov and yudson@xcite and our result discussed below .      using the fact that @xmath126 , we see from eqs.([eq : ifrewrite ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmanldef ] ) that the disorder averaged static non - equilibrium current that is generated at quadratic order in a space- and time - dependent longitudinal electric field with fourier components @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 with @xmath129 we thus need to know the flux - dependent part of the disorder averaged polarization of the ring . for frequencies @xmath130 and wave - vectors @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 is the elastic mean free path ) non - perturbative methods",

    "higher orders should be negligible as long as @xmath202 .",
    "thus , the largest value of @xmath203 where eq.([eq : ifinal ] ) can be expected to be accurate is @xmath204 next , consider the optimal choice of the frequency .",
    "because of the factor of @xmath205 in eq.([eq : ifinal ] ) , it is advantageous to choose the frequency as small as possible .",
    "however , our perturbative calculation breaks down for frequencies of the order of the mean level spacing @xmath51 .",
    "the optimal choice is therefore @xmath206 finally , from eq.([eq : fx ] ) and figs.[fig : fx ] , [ fig : fmax ] it is clear that the function @xmath207 has a maximum at a value @xmath208 ( provided @xmath209 is not too large ) .",
    "this implies that for @xmath167 the non - equilibrium current is maximal at the static flux @xmath210 , where @xmath211 the function @xmath212 is shown in fig.[fig : fmax ] . from eq.([eq : xdef ] ) we also see that the width @xmath213 of the interval around @xmath214 ( modulo @xmath215 ) where the current is enhanced is @xmath216 .",
    "outside this interval , which is rather narrow for @xmath217 , the non - equilibrium current is much smaller than at the maxima ( see fig.[fig : graph ] ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath218 the parameter @xmath219 in eq.([eq : xdef ] ) is large compared with unity , so that we may approximate @xmath220 where we have assumed that @xmath221 .",
    "using @xmath222 $ ] , the non - equilibrium current in this regime can be written as @xmath223 ^ 2   | \\bar{\\omega } |^2   \\frac {   \\sin ( 4 \\pi \\bar{\\phi } ) } { [ 1 - \\cos ( 4 \\pi \\bar{\\phi})]^3 }   \\label{eq : ifinal2 }   \\ ; .\\ ] ] for the parameters of the experiment@xcite ( taking now the spin degeneracy into account ) , we find that at the optimal values of the parameters given in eqs.([eq : phiomegaopt][eq : phistatopt ] ) the maximal amplitude of the non - equilibrium current is @xmath224 .",
    "this current has the same order of magnitude as the equilibrium current measured in refs.@xcite , and therefore should be measurable with the available technology .",
    "the rather pronounced peaks of @xmath7 as function of @xmath6 for small values of @xmath6 ( modulo @xmath215 ) distinguish the non - equilibrium current from the thermodynamic persistent current .",
    "in this paper we have presented a thorough theoretical analysis of the static non - equilibrium current @xmath0 in a mesoscopic metal ring threaded by a magnetic flux , which is generated in quadratic response to a time - dependent electric field . using a path integral approach ,",
    "we have shown that this non - equilibrium current is closely related to the screened exchange contribution to the thermodynamic persistent current@xcite .",
    "in fact , from eqs.([eq : if ] ) , ( [ eq : ifrewrite ] ) , and ( [ eq : sigmanldef ] ) it is obvious that the weight of the rpa screened interaction in the exchange correction to the equilibrium persistent current at fixed energy - momentum transfer is essentially given by the non - linear conductivity @xmath4 associated with @xmath0 . this observation has allowed us to derive the relation ( [ eq : sigma2av ] ) between the non - linear conductivity and the flux - dependent part of the polarization .",
    "thus , the disorder average @xmath225 of the non - linear conductivity is directly related to the weak - localization correction to the average polarization , which in turn can be expressed in terms of the weak - localization correction to the linear conductivity . in other words , _ the average non - linear conductivity is directly related to the weak localization correction to the linear conductivity_.    a measurement of the average static non - equilibrium current @xmath7 in a mesoscopic metal ring as function of frequency and static flux would be very interesting for several reasons .",
    "such a measurement would directly probe the weak localization corrections to the frequency - dependent polarization and the linear conductivity of the system .",
    "in contrast to kravtsov and yudson@xcite , we predict that the static non - equilibrium current should be exponentially suppressed when the external frequency exceeds the thouless energy .",
    "this is in agreement with the close connection between the non - equilibrium current @xmath0 and the fock contribution @xmath226 to the equilibrium persistent current .",
    "the latter is known to be exponentially suppressed if the temperature becomes larger than the thouless energy@xcite .",
    "note that in this case the temperature acts as an infrared cutoff , just like the external frequency in the case of the non - equilibrium current .",
    "our theory can be verified experimentally from the measurement of the _ time - independent _ non - linear current response of a mesoscopic metal ring pierced by a _ time - dependent _ external flux @xmath227 of the form ( [ eq : phiomega ] ) , with frequencies in the range @xmath228 .",
    "we hope that such an experiment will be done in the near future .",
    "we would like to thank kurt schnhammer for his constructive comments .",
