    "<S> the estimated critical concentration separating localized and critical states @xmath59 is also relatively above the numerical estimate of classical percolation threshold@xcite . in figure  5 , we plot two typical wave - functions representing an extended and a critical state . notice that the critical wave - function exhibits spikes of many sizes reflecting its multifractal nature@xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the quantum percolation problem in a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian with diluted long - range hopping amplitudes whose probability of occurrence decay as @xmath60 . for the regime of @xmath61 , a spanning cluster of connected sites emerges above a classical percolation threshold @xmath15 with mean - field like exponents for @xmath62 and non - trivial ones for @xmath63 . using numerical diagonalization on finite lattices and finite size scaling , we found that for @xmath22 the one - electron eigenstates exhibit a localization / delocalization transition with increasing first - neighbors bond concentration @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum critical percolation was found to be above , although relatively close to , the classical threshold . in the regime of @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> no truly extended states appears even for @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , a phase transition between localized and critical states takes place .    </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization procedure employed in the present work does not allow much larger systems to be investigated within a reasonable computational effort . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , precise estimates of quantum critical thresholds and exponents governing the presently reported transitions require the use of alternative methods that are able to overcome the large corrections to scaling present in this model , specially at the vicinity of the @xmath65 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> numerical techniques which are less sensitive to geometrical problems , such as energy levels and multifractal analysis , would provide further relevant insights on these points . </S>",
    "<S> also , analytical approaches along the lines used to investigate the power - law random band anderson model@xcite would certainly be valuable . </S>",
    "<S> we hope the present report can stimulate further works in these directions .    </S>",
