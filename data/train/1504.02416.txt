    "although the great success of the standard @xmath1cdm cosmological model in describing most observations , we are still distant from the full understanding of the cosmic dynamics . apart from the so called small scale problems in the dark matter sector , there is also a huge discussion about dark energy properties . at the same time , the efficient approach given by a cosmological constant @xmath1 still seems to face some challenges , mainly from the theoretical point of view .    among the viable alternatives , it has been argued that a model with the mechanism of dark matter particle production at a constant rate @xmath2 ( implying in a dynamical vacuum term @xmath0 ) is also capable to produce a concordance model @xcite , although with a larger current matter fraction @xmath3 we define @xmath4 with @xmath5 , where the subscript @xmath6 denotes today s values . in this paper",

    "if the total energy is given by @xmath8 and the pressure of the vacuum contribution sets to @xmath9 , a constant @xmath2 is equivalent to take @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the hubble rate does not lead to an exactly constant @xmath2 . ] .",
    "taking today s values one finds @xmath12 .",
    "the matter dynamics corresponds to the balance @xmath13 from which it is not difficult to show that @xmath14 .",
    "the background expansion is given by @xmath15 from which we can derive the matter density evolution @xmath16.\\ ] ] note that , as in the flat @xmath1cdm model , there are here also only two free parameters .",
    "the concordance of this @xmath0 cosmology with @xmath3 has been verified via many different observational data at both the background @xcite and perturbative @xcite levels .    concerning structure formation",
    ", the full cmb spectrum has not yet been obtained for this model , but cmb physics can also be accessed via isw studies , i.e. , how time - varying gravitational potential wells change the temperature of the cmb photons as they cross structures @xcite .",
    "the expansion of an einstein - de sitter universe compensates the clustering of structures , producing no isw effect , i.e. , in a matter dominated universe there is no `` late time '' isw effect .",
    "dark energy modifies the background expansion and leads to a net contribution to @xmath17 .",
    "then , it is expected that the modified background and perturbative expansion of the @xmath0cdm model leaves a distinct imprint on the isw signal .",
    "since the isw is a secondary cmb temperature effect its detection occurs only via the cross - correlation with other large scale probes like galaxies and quasars surveys @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the cross - correlation technique to probe the @xmath0cdm model , finding an increase of the isw - galaxy spectrum ( @xmath18 ) in comparison to the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "our aim in this paper is to perform this analysis taking care with some peculiarities of the model . in particular , it is important to differentiate the evolution of the baryonic and dark matter components . at the background level , baryons are included in the conserved part of ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "concerning perturbations , the observed matter power spectrum @xmath19 is a measurement of the baryonic clustering , which is sourced by the gravitational potential . in the @xmath1cdm model",
    "there is almost no difference between the evolution on large scales of such components .",
    "the same does not happen in the @xmath0cdm model , where one observes a late - time suppression in the dark matter and total matter contrasts owing to dark matter production , a suppression not observed in the baryonic contrast .",
    "our interest is also justified by a possible tension between the theoretical @xmath1cdm predictions and the observed isw signal .",
    "some analysis have reported a cross - correlation signal @xmath20-@xmath21 above that expected in the standard cosmology @xcite ( see @xcite for a critical review on this issue ) .",
    "recent studies claim a better statistical concordance though the observed signal is still higher than the theoretical one @xcite . also , the inferred stacking of cmb data on the position of superstructures is about 5 times larger than the @xmath1cdm prediction @xcite .",
    "this result has recently been confirmed by the 2015 release of the planck cmb data @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we develop the background expansion which will be used in this paper . in section [ sectioniii ]",
    "we explore the scalar perturbations of the model .",
    "the connection with the isw effect is made via a direct calculation of the evolution of the gravitational potential ( [ pot ] ) and the isw - lss cross - correlation ( [ crossiswlss ] ) .",
    "we conclude in the final section .",
    "the brief description of the @xmath0cdm dynamics given in equations [ contrhom]-[omega ] has been widely derived in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that as in the standard case the important quantity is the total matter density @xmath22 , the sum of the dark matter @xmath23 and baryons @xmath24 .",
    "the latter is constrained by nucleosynthesis and is well approximated by @xmath25 .",
    "we assume hereafter this value .",
    "the baryonic sector is conserved and therefore we have the continuity equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 adding these equations we obtain the total matter conservation equation ( [ contrhom ] ) . with @xmath10 , the dynamics presented in section [ intro ] follows .",
    "that is , the background expansion is obtained after solving the system given by the continuity equation @xmath28 and the friedmann equation @xmath29 where the prime means derivative with respect to the scale factor .",
    "when cosmological perturbation theory is used to study the large scale structure of the universe we are most interested in the evolution of scalar quantities like the density contrast and the gravitational potential .",
    "the @xmath0cdm models have the particularity of suppressing the growth of dark matter contrast @xmath30 .",
    "however , the observed structures reflect the behavior of the baryonic contrast , @xmath31 , instead . in the standard cosmology",
    "this quantity coincides with the dark matter contrast , and the total matter contrast @xmath32 denotes both behaviors . for the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "however , we should make a distinction between the different components .",
    "using the fact that the vacuum fluctuations are negligible @xcite and choosing the comoving synchronous gauge we obtain the set of equations @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the trace of the spatial metric perturbation . combining these equations and changing to the derivative with respect to the scale factor we find @xmath37 and @xmath38    cdm model with @xmath39 .",

    "as expected , @xmath44 and @xmath47 have the same evolution in the standard case . on the other hand ,",
    "the plot shows a late - time growth suppression of @xmath47 in the @xmath43cdm model , a consequence of dark matter creation .",
    "the same suppression is not observed in the baryonic contrast though its amplitude achieves a plateau on late times which is slightly below the standard scenario .",

    "this expression allows us to calculate the isw , which can be computed via the line of sight integration ( [ iswdeltat ] ) .",
    "it is useful to perform it in terms of the comoving distance @xmath53 the isw then reads @xmath54 where we have defined @xmath55 with @xmath56    the baryonic and total matter density contrasts can be directly calculated from the solution of eqs .",

    "the concordance particle creation model is a viable alternative to the standard @xmath1cdm paradigm , with the same free parameters , namely @xmath22 and @xmath92 . since particle creation at a constant rate leads to a different background and perturbative dynamics , it is important to investigate specific signatures of this model in comparison to the standard cosmology .",
    "we provided in this work a direct computation of the evolution of perturbed scalar quantities like the matter and baryonic density contrasts and the gravitational potential for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "there is a clear scenario emerging in such a cosmology ( see fig .",

    "this dynamics does indeed lead to a consistent description of the structure formation data @xcite .",
    "our main goal here was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the isw effect in such concordance particle creation cosmology . with the results for the perturbative dynamics calculated in section ii we computed the cmb - lss cross correlation spectrum .",
    "our care in calculating the evolution of both baryonic and total matter contrasts in detail leads to a full and safe analysis of the @xmath18 spectrum .",
    "current efforts @xcite in obtaining the observed @xmath18 spectrum are sending a clear message : the cmb - lss signal seems to slightly exceed the @xmath1cdm prediction .",
    "therefore , it is timely to check the @xmath0cdm outcomes for this cosmological observable .",
    "for both the nvss ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) and wise ( fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] ) data , the @xmath0cdm model leads to a desirable excess of power in the @xmath18 spectrum of order @xmath93-@xmath94 .",
    "this is in fact a small increase that potentially can not be sensitive to isw probes .",
    "it is worth noting that the available data is insufficient for distinguishing cosmological models with a reliable statistical confidence .",
    "this happens mainly because of the cosmic variance limits imposed to large scale cmb analysis , that leads to a very low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "here we are restricted to a qualitative comparison between the @xmath0 and standard cosmologies .",
    "future data can in principle improve the accuracy of the cmb - lss cross - correlation technique and therefore specific features of different cosmological models concerning the isw effect could be compared in more detail . although pure isw detection techniques do not seem to be a powerful tool in discriminating cosmological models , they can eventually complement other cosmological probes .",
