    "the soliton picture of the baryon is employed by many effective models of qcd in the low energy region : the skyrme model @xcite , the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite and the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) @xcite .",
    "a technical feature of the picture is the separation of the internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "the internal degrees of freedom ( mesons , quarks ) nonlinearly interact with each other and construct the soliton self - consistently . on the other hand ,",
    "the external degrees of freedom describe the collective motions of the soliton : rotation , vibration , translational motion . to solve the coupled equations for these degrees of freedom , for technical reason",
    ", one should assume the decoupling of the internal degrees of freedom with the collective motion and employ the simplest ansatz for the soliton : the hedgehog shape .",
    "for example , in the cqsm , the equations of motion for the soliton consist of the local functions of the meson profile and the infinite eigenstates of the quarks in the background soliton .",
    "then , the equations should be self - consistently solved .",
    "the process requires a large number of calculations by the computer . and",
    "it is hard to self - consistently incorporate the interaction between the nonrigid soliton and the collective motion .",
    "thus , the symmetry of the soliton is a technically important ingredient to reduce the number of calculational steps . from the physical point of view",
    ", however , it seems oversimplified that one assumes the symmetry which is broken by the collective rotation .    in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied these assumption for the octet baryons with the cqsm . to overcome the complexities of the self - consistent calculation",
    "for the nonrigid soliton and incorporate the interaction between the soliton and the collective motion , we introduced the physical and/or mathematical tools : the mean field approximation for the rotated system , the tensor operator @xmath0 for the grand spin which is used to expand the chiral field , and the explicit form of the isospin vector of the chiral soliton with the quark states .",
    "the result indicated that the hedgehog shape of the soliton is stable only for the nucleon ( @xmath1 ) and unstable for the strange baryons ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , the soliton changes the shape according to the strangeness of the baryon .",
    "although these tools are applicable to the more general systems , the collective hamiltonian takes the complicated form and the outlook of the collective quantization is bad due to the less symmetry of the nonrigid soliton than the hedgehog one .",
    "therefore , in this article , we reformulate the collective hamiltonian and improve the procedure of the collective quantization given in ref .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the hartree approximation for the kaon to simplify the treatment of the particle - antiparticle creation @xcite .",
    "we apply these improved tools to the octet and decuplet baryons .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : coll_q ] , first , we construct the collective hamiltonian using the variable transformation .",
