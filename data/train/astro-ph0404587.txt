    "the study of the small scale structure in the universe is a much discussed topic in current astronomy .",
    "one of the reasons for this wide interest is the discrepancies between observations and the predictions of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "for instance , from @xmath6-body simulation ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) the expected number of satellites orbiting galaxies like the milky way or andromeda is an order of magnitude larger than that observed in the local group ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ) .",
    "this is a potentially strong objection against the hierarchical scenario proposed in the standard cdm model . to solve this discrepancy",
    "several mechanisms that suppress the formation of satellites after the re - ionization in the early epoch of the universe have been proposed ( e.g. , bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) .",
    "so far , it is unclear whether this or any of the other mechanisms proposed is able to reconcile fully the predictions from the models and the observations .",
    "satellite galaxies are also interesting for tracing the gravitational potential and for estimating the mass of the parent galaxy at distances unreachable with other methods ( erickson , gottesman & hunter 1999 ) .",
    "the standard models predict a decline in satellite galaxy velocity with distance to the primary .",
    "this has been observationally explored by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and prada et al .",
    "the predicted effect was not found in the analysis of the first group . however , prada et al . , with better statistics and the removal of interlopers , have claimed the existence of this decline in the way predicted by the standard models .",
    "our knowledge of satellite galaxies beyond the local group is still very limited , owing to the intrinsic faintness of these objects .",
    "for instance , in the local group the known dwarf satellite galaxies have brightnesses in the range @xmath7 .",
    "so detailed studies of external systems are limited to galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "even surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( prada et al .",
    "2003 ) are capable to sampling only the very bright part of the luminosity function of these objects , typically detecting 12 satellites orbiting each giant galaxy .",
    "for instance , the external isolated galaxies in which a larger number of galaxies have been found are ngc  1961 ( gottesman , hunter & shostak 1993 ) and ngc  5084 ( carignan et al .",
    "1997 ) in which 5 and 9 satellites respectively have been catalogued .",
    "bearing all the above points in mind , we decided to start a study of satellite galaxies orbiting external isolated galaxies .",
    "we extracted our sample from the compilation of such objects by zaritsky et al .",
    "only spiral parents were included in that catalogue .",
    "a similar catalogue for parents with elliptical morphologies is being compiled by smith & martinez ( 2003 ) . with photometry in optical broad ( @xmath8 ) and narrow bands ( h@xmath9 ) , and near infrared ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of both the satellites and their parent galaxies we address the following questions : i ) what are the properties ( statistics , luminosity function , morphology , structure , colors , etc . ) of the satellite galaxies , and how do they compare with those found in the local group ; ii ) how the above properties are related to the relative positions of the satellite galaxies with respect to their parents ; iii ) what the possible interactions are between satellites , and between satellites and their parents ; and iv ) the star formation rate and how it is related with the overall properties and relative position of the satellites . in the first paper of this series , gutierrez , azzaro , & prada ( 2002 , hereafter paper  i )",
    ", we presented the structural parameters and morphological classification of @xmath12 of such objects . here , we present the photometry and first analysis of the colors of most of them .",
    "a full analysis combining structure and photometry and testing against the predictions of theoretical models will be conducted and presented in the near future .",
    "the observations presented here were performed during several runs at the iac80 , the nordic optical telescope ( not ) , , and the 1.23 and 2.2 m calar alto telescopes .",
    "the details of the sample can be found in zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and paper  i. typical integration times per filter and galaxy range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 minutes on the iac80 , and from @xmath155 to @xmath1530 min on the other telescopes .",
    "the seeing was between 1.5 and 2.0 arcsec in most cases .",
    "the observations were usually performed in photometric conditions and calibrated using landolt stars ( landolt 1992 ) . in a few cases of non - photometric nights we made relative calibrations with photometric nights using bright field stars ( typically 48 in each case ) .",
    "the typical rms accuracy of the calibration is @xmath150.03 mag .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf .",
    "more details on the observations and reduction can be found in paper  i. the magnitudes presented here were computed using the software sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and correspond to the total integrated magnitudes computed in apertures defined in the way proposed by kron ( 1980 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimation of these magnitudes are dominated by the sky subtraction and the extrapolation of the external profile of the galaxies .",
    "we estimate the typical overall uncertainty as @xmath150.1 mag .",
    "table  1 presents the integrated photometry in the four bands .",
    "we have photometry for 49 objects , @xmath1580% of them in all four bands . for most of them",
    "we have also analyzed the morphology and structure ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the galaxies span a range of @xmath156 mag in apparent magnitude .",
    "when converted to absolute magnitudes , this range is @xmath155 mag , i.e. , a factor of @xmath15100 in mass .",
    "we have made a comparison between the @xmath16 magnitudes presented by zaritsky et al .  and our estimate in this band .",
    "to obtain the absolute magnitudes from our measurements we have used a value of the hubble constant of 72 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "we have excluded in this comparison the object ngc  5965@xmath18 because we have found two objects ( denoted as ngc  5965@xmath181 and ngc  5965@xmath182 in table  1 ) that are very close together ( the angular distance between them is 1.6 arcsec ) , and it is unclear if the magnitude quoted by zaritsky et al",
    ".  corresponds to one of the two components or to the combination of both .",
    "the objects show evidence of interaction , so we think that both are satellites of ngc  5965 .",
    "after these objects were excluded , we have 39 objects with measurements in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the absolute magnitude in the @xmath0 band zaritsky et al .",
    "( denoted here by @xmath19 ) were slightly modified in order to take into account the different values of the hubble constant used by these authors and by us ( 75 and 72 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 respectively ) . in figure",
    "[ comparison ] we present this comparison .",
    "the differences are @xmath20 .",
    "the figure shows no systematic error , the mean value of the residuals being 0.31 mag and the rms @xmath21 mag . considering that the magnitudes reported by zaritsky et al .",
    "are photographic , and that these authors estimated a proper uncertainty of @xmath22 mag , we conclude that both estimates are in very good agreement .",
    "this comparison also indicates that our uncertainties in the estimation of the magnitudes are small compared with the above value .",
    "the existence of a color  magnitude relation for elliptical galaxies in clusters is widely known ( e.g. , visvanathan & sandage 1977 ) .",
    "the origin of this relation is controversial : while some authors ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) have argued that the relation is a consequence of changes in metallicity , others ( ferreras , charlot , & silk 1999 ) think that it is a consequence of changes in both age and metallicity . recently ( vazdekis et al .",
    "2001 ) have analyzed high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of six elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster using a new spectral index , and conclude that the color ",
    "magnitude relation is a consequence of a relation between luminosity ( or mass ) and metallicity . for the analysis presented in this section ,",
    "we have corrected the magnitudes quoted in table  1 for galactic extinction using the model by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "figure  [ cmr ] presents a color  magnitude diagram for the galaxies classified as early and late types in our sample .",
    "the objects span a range of @xmath154 mag while they are in a narrow range in the @xmath23 and @xmath4 colors .",
    "although the statistics are poor because of the low number of objects analyzed , the existence of a tight relation between colors and magnitudes is clear .",
    "this color ",
    "magnitude relation is similar for both types of galaxies ( early and late ) , although it is notable that the dispersion of the early types with respect to these relations is smaller .",
    "the mean values are + 0.70 and + 0.65 for the @xmath23 colors , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the @xmath4 colors of early and late types respectively .",
    "for these two type of galaxies we have conducted least squares fits of the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "for these fits we assigned the same weight to all galaxies .",
    "the parameters of these fits are presented in table  2 .",
    "combining the two colors @xmath23 and @xmath4 , we obtain the color  color diagram presented in figure  [ col ] .",
    "as expected from the previous figure , galaxies tend to occupy a narrow region in this diagram , with the brightest galaxies being redder than the faintest ones .",
    "roughly speaking , the position ( 0.8 , 1.0 ) in the ( @xmath23 , @xmath4 ) plane separates galaxies with @xmath28 from those with @xmath29 .",
    "we have compared these results with those found for galaxies with similar magnitudes in the fornax cluster by karick , drinkwater , & gregg ( 2003 ) , and griersmith ( 1982 ) .",
    "we note similar trends but with a larger dispersion in our objects ; and a reddening with luminosity similar in the @xmath23 colors and larger in @xmath4 for the galaxies of our sample .",
    "for instance , karick et al .",
    "obtained mean values of @xmath23 of 0.70 and 0.57 for their sample of dwarf ellipticals and late types .",
    "these values are roughly compatible with those that we have obtained .",
    "the small discrepancy found between the @xmath23 colors of late types is partially due to the different magntitude range of galaxies in both samples .",
    "karick et al .",
    "obtained a slope for the @xmath23 relation of the early type population of @xmath30 ; this and the value found by griersmith ( 1982 ) are compatible with our results .",
    "however the slope obtained for the @xmath4 curve is different between the fornax members and the objects analyzed here .",
    "the slope of this color - magnitude relation is larger in our sample .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the common range in magnitude between both samples , this difference persists .",
    "possible reasons for this difference will be analyzed in a future paper .",
    "we have compared the photometric properties of the satellites of our sample with those found for galaxies in the local group .",
    "the values for the photometric integrated magnitudes have been taken from the compilation by mateo ( 1998 ) and correspond to all the members of the local group known by that time , apart of the milky way , m31 , and the two magellanic clouds which have been excluded from the analysis .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ compar_gl ] in which we present the color  magnitude diagram for both sets of objects .",
    "the typical uncertainties for our measurements in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath150.1 mag ( when the colors are computed part of the systematic errors cancel out ) . in this figure",
    "we have also included a few objects for which we do not have a morphological classification and so excluded them from figure  [ cmr ] .",
    "for the local group galaxies the uncertainties in the colors are @xmath150.05 while , according to the compilation by mateo ( 1998 ) , the uncertainty is , in general , large for the integrated magnitudes . although we have not represented these errors , they are not essential for making a qualitative analysis of the figure .",
    "we see how the external satellites correspond to the brightest part of the local group luminosity function , and also to some brighter satellites with luminosities similar to that of m33 .",
    "this is expected because of the way in which the original sample by zaritsky et al .  was built .",
    "galaxies within the common range of magnitudes have similar @xmath23 color and dispersions .",
    "the least - squares fit of @xmath23 vs. @xmath16 obtained for the early - type external satellites seems also to fit notably well the galaxies of the local group .",
    "this extends the validity of this color ",
    "magnitude relation through a range of 12 magnitudes and demonstrates the universal nature of the color  magnitude relation for satellite galaxies .",
    "the existence of color gradients in early - type galaxies is well known . in general ,",
    "elliptical galaxies tend to be redder in their inner regions . as for the color ",
    "magnitude relation , the effect could be explained by either a gradient in stellar age or metallicity , or by a combination of both .",
    "the existence of dust more concentrated in the central parts of the galaxy could also contribute totally or partially to the observed color gradients .",
    "the first studies for giant ellipticals using ccd measurement were conducted by franx & illingworth ( 1990 ) , peletier et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and de jong ( 1996 ) . using the _ hubble space telescope _ , this study has been extended to galaxies at higher redshift ( moth & elston 2002 ) , who show the existence of negative gradients at intermediate ( @xmath31 ) redshifts , while the gradients become very positive at higher ( @xmath32 ) redshifts .",
    "we have analyzed the gradients of the 16 galaxies classified as e or e / s0 in the morphological analysis presented in paper  i. considering the angular size of the objects and the limiting magnitude and spatial resolution of our data , we decided to conduct a very simple analysis in the following way : i ) we checked the value of the seeing in both filters ( in cases of significant different values , the image in the filter with best seeing was convolved with a gaussian of appropriate width to match in the convolved image the seeing in the other filter ) , ii ) we selected the angular range between @xmath33 fwhm and the radius which encloses the full galaxy and computed the integrated magnitudes in several concentric apertures within this range , and iii ) we did a linear least - squares fit of @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 .",
    "the slope of this relation is denoted by @xmath36 and is presented in table  3 . in some cases",
    "we check the behavior of this gradient with that obtained using other colors ( usually @xmath4 ) .",
    "a few galaxies were excluded from this analysis for the reasons detailed below : ngc  895@xmath18 , which has an off - center nucleus and is also a rather compact object with an angular size too small to compute the gradients ; ngc  2718@xmath18 , which , apart from being an object in clear interaction with ngc  2718@xmath37 , has another object very close to it ( we were able to separate it from the main galaxy in the photometric analysis presented in this paper , but not in this estimate of gradients ) ; ngc  5962@xmath18 , whose angular size is too small with respect to the seeing ; a910@xmath18 and ngc  2939@xmath18 because we have observed them in only one filter ; and ngc  4541@xmath37 , which is in clear interaction with ngc  4541@xmath38 and whose gradients shows a complex dependence on radius .",
    "we have also included the galaxy ngc  3735@xmath37 , classified as early type in paper  i , but which is not included in table  1 because of the lack of calibrated observations of this galaxy .",
    "after this selection , we were left with nine objects , whose results are presented in table  3 .",
    "seven of the nine galaxies have negative slopes , while ngc  488@xmath18 has a value very close to 0 and , surprisingly , ngc  4725@xmath37 shows an extremely positive gradients ( i.e. , the outer parts are notably redder than the inner ones .",
    "we have checked this trend measuring the gradients in other colors and obtained the same tendency .",
    "positive gradients such as this are uncommon in low redshift galaxies and probably indicate strong star formation in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "this galaxy is rather regular , and so far , we have not found any clear evidence of distortions associated with any interactions or mergers that could trigger this burst .",
    "the mean value of the gradient ( excluding ngc  4725@xmath37 ) is @xmath39 .",
    "1 .   we have presented integrated photometry of 49 satellite galaxies orbiting external isolated spiral galaxies . 2 .",
    "the @xmath23 vs.  @xmath40 color magnitude relation is similar to the one found in the fornax cluster for galaxies with similar magnitudes .",
    "however the @xmath4 vs.  @xmath40 relation is steeper in our sample as compared with galaxies in fornax .",
    "the @xmath23 vs.  @xmath16 color diagram extends to brighter magnitudes the relations found for satellite galaxies in the local group .",
    "we have measured the internal color gradients of nine early - type satellites . excluding a galaxy with a strong positive gradient",
    ", we found @xmath41 .",
