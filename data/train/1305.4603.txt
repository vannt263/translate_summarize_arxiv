    "<S> in the setting of black holes this goes back to @xcite .    for schwarzschild black holes the regge  </S>",
    "<S> wheeler reduction ( see below ) produces a one dimensional potential similar to the eckart barrier potential @xmath38 for which resonances are given by @xmath39  see @xcite for a review in the context of chemistry , @xcite for a mathematical discussion in the schwarzschild case , and  @xcite for a general study of pschl  teller potentials . </S>",
    "<S> putting together different angular momenta produces an ( approximate ) lattice of resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath9 , that is , in the genuine kerr case , the degenarate qnm split in a way similar to the zeeman effect . </S>",
    "<S> they have been recently studied using wkb methods based on the completely integrable structure @xcite and the zeeman - like splitting has been rigorously confirmed .    </S>",
    "<S> the point of this article is to describe recent mathematical results @xcite which apply to _ stationary perturbations of kerr metrics _ and do not depend on the completely integrable structure . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on the use of the @xmath0-normal hyperbolicity of the trapped set and show that many features of qnm studied using wkb methods available in the completely integrable case persist for perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40-normal hyperbolicity of black hole dynamics @xcite has not been discussed in the physics literature but the importance of normal hyperbolicity in molecular dynamics has been explored  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to consider the stability of @xmath0-normally hyperbolic dynamics under more general , non - stationary , perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show how dynamical features ( such as the maximal and minimal expansion rates ) and statistical properties of the distribution of quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) depend on @xmath41 , the rescaled angular momentum . for the exact kerr ( or kerr  de sitter ) </S>",
    "<S> black hole the counting law for qnm and their maximal and minimal decay rates determine the mass and the angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> for the perturbed case , they determine stable features such as the symplectic volume of the trapped set and classical decay rates .    </S>",
    "<S> the presentation is organized as follows : in  [ tsn ] we discuss classical dynamics and define @xmath0-normal hyperbolicity in a precise way ; in  [ ddq ] we describe the challenges of rigorously defining of qnm for kerr and kerr - de sitter black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulties come from the presence of the ergosphere which obstruct standard methods for defining resonances ( lack of coercivity / ellipticity of the stationary wave equation ) and from the `` size '' of infinity in the kerr ( @xmath13 ) case . in  [ dqn ] </S>",
    "<S> we present the quantitative results about the distribution of qnm valid for perturbations of kerr black hole : bounds on imaginary parts of the modes , the counting law , and the consequences for solutions of the wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest results are subject to a pinching condition which is valid for all but rapidly rotating rotating black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here and some of the figures have appeared in works aimed at the mathematical audience @xcite and this is an attempt to relate them to an active field of research in physics . </S>"
