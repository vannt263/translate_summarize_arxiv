    "there is currently much effort devoted to understanding the nature of vortex phases in high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the flux lines ( fls ) in a clean material prefer to sit on the sites of a triangular lattice forming an abrikosov solid for fields @xmath2 . however , this mean field phase diagram is modified by the combined effects of thermal fluctuations and various types of disorder , such as oxygen vacancies , columnar defects , or twin boundaries . understanding the precise nature of these new phases is very important for the determination of the transport properties of these materials . in this paper , we focus on the combined effects of point - like disorder , such as oxygen vacancies , and a parallel current .",
    "( there are many studies that consider other types of disorder @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that pinning to even a small amount of random impurities is sufficient to destroy the long - range translational order of the abrikosov lattice@xcite .",
    "if randomness is strong , the underlying order is destroyed at every scale , but for weak enough randomness , some order is expected to survive at short distances .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that there may exist a stable , dislocation - free bragg glass ( brg ) phase at low magnetic fields and temperatures in the presence of weak point impurities @xcite .",
    "it is important , both for technical applications of high @xmath3 materials and from a theoretical point of view , to understand the stability of this new phase with respect to an external current .",
    "for example , one may wish to control the melting transition of the brg phase by some external parameter such as current .",
    "the case of a current perpendicular to the vortex lines was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the driven lattice may still maintain a topologically ordered moving brg phase . here",
    ", we study the case in which current is applied parallel to the fls .",
    "the instability of the proposed equations for the brg suggests that the long - range topological order of this phase is most likely destroyed by a parallel current . using a lindemann criterion and a cage model ,",
    "we then discuss the destruction of any remnant short range order .",
    "this is in the same spirit as a recent calculation@xcite , in which we used a langevin equation to examine the dynamics and fluctuations of a fl in the presence of an _ alternating _ parallel current .",
    "the basic idea is that even in the absence of true long - range order due to current or impurities , there remains a great deal of translational order in the vortex system at short scales . a  phase diagram \"",
    "is then constructed to indicate the apparent limits of this  ordered \" region .",
    "the response of fls to a parallel current @xmath4 was studied extensively even prior to the high-@xmath3 era @xcite . while , a straight fl is stable in the presence of @xmath4 , any fluctuation of the line causes helical instabilities at long wavelengths @xcite .",
    "a lattice of fls is similarly unstable in the presence of an infinitesimal @xmath4 , if it penetrates the whole sample . as shown by brandt @xcite , for a finite penetration depth of current , a finite @xmath5 ,",
    "is needed to cause instability , where @xmath6 is related to the shear modules @xmath7 .",
    "brandt has suggested @xcite that fls can also be stabilized for infinitesimal @xmath4 ( which decays exponentially into the sample ) due to pinning by disorder .",
    "however , this study predates the introduction of the brg phase , which is more ordered than a flux liquid .",
    "we may thus ask if the brg phase is stable with respect to @xmath4 ? more generally , what is the behavior of the flux line in response to the current @xmath4 when point impurities are present ?",
    "since , the melting of the brg phase is thought to be first order , the possibility of diverging longitudinal and perpendicular penetration depths of the current at the transition point is excluded .",
    "nonetheless , we shall assume a current @xmath4 which uniformly penetrates the whole sample , and calculate the mean - squared fluctuations of the fl based on this assumption @xcite .",
    "this quantity is then used to examine the extent of short - range order , and to construct an apparent  phase diagram \" in the magnetic field ",
    "temperature ( @xmath8 ) plane .",
    "two models used for the study of fls with disorder are introduced in sec .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "the first model describes the elastic behavior of the vortex lattice in the presence of impurities , and is appropriate for the study of its long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the true long - range order of the lattice is destroyed by such fluctuations , and possibly replaced by the weaker topological order of the proposed bragg glass@xcite .",
    "the second model considers a single fl confined by a harmonic cage potential that represents interactions with the other fls .",
    "this model provides an approximate measure of the extent of short - range fluctuations , and in conjunction with a lindemann criterion can be used to construct a phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the addition of current to these models is straightforward .    in sec .",
    "[ replicas ] replica variational methods are used to estimate fl fluctuations in the presence of impurities and current .",
    "the brg phase is described by a variational ansatz that breaks full replica symmetry .",
    "we propose a natural extension of this solution in the presence of current .",
    "this solution , however , has unbounded fluctuations and suffers from the same long - wavelength instabilities as the uniform lattice .",
    "we interpret this as a signal of the destruction of brg order by the current .",
    "( naturally , we can not rule out other potential variational solutions with other forms of remnant long - range order .",
    ") however , it is quite likely that some degree of short - range translational order survives for weak currents and impurities . using the cage model",

    ", we generalize the replica variational ansatz proposed by goldschmidt@xcite to include a current .",
    "the mean - squared fluctuations of the fl are found to grow with increasing current and/or impurities .",
    "consequently , in the absence of the cage potential , a single fl is unstable in the presence of an infinitesimal current , and is not stabilized by the impurities alone .",

    "in particular , we again find that both impurities and currents enhance transverse fluctuations , and that the fl is unstable in the absence of the cage potential .    the conclusion that pinned fls",
    "are unstable , even to infinitesimal current @xmath0 , may appear as somewhat counterintuitive : the force due to the current on a portion of the fl is then much less than the attractive potential from impurities .",
