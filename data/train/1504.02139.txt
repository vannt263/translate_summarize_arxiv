    "protein content depends on a complex interplay of genetic , epigenetic and metabolic processes , with numerous cell - specific regulatory mechanisms and feedback loops .",
    "however , recent experiments  @xcite have demonstrated that for two different types of microorganism ( yeast and bacteria ) , each under a broad range of conditions , the distribution of highly expressed protein copy number appears _ universal _ : under rescaling by mean and standard deviation , all such distributions collapse onto a single skewed curve  @xcite . in the same experiments variances",

    "a recent study following the protein content in individual _",
    "e.  coli _ bacteria over roughly 70  generations has revealed that , under the same scaling criteria , the shape of the distribution of protein copy number sampled over time in an individual converges to the one observed in large populations  @xcite . while analogous temporal data are currently unavailable for yeast , this is an important property that reflects the ergodicity of the relative fluctuations in protein expression in bacteria .",
    "these results can serve as a basis for constructing a model relating bacterial temporal protein dynamics to their distributions .",
    "given that the universal statistical properties described above were found for a range of experimental conditions for various proteins in bacteria  @xcite , such a model should rely only on general coarse - grained processes .",
    "we therefore start by assuming as little as possible given the experimental data :    * protein number increases as @xmath0 during the @xmath1 generation , where the exponential growth rate @xmath2 fluctuates with @xmath3  @xcite . *",
    "the time @xmath4 of the @xmath5 generation ( i.e. , the time between cell division at the @xmath6 generation and that at the @xmath1 ) is also random @xcite . *",
    "the product @xmath7 is a random variable , with ( positive ) mean @xmath8 and variance @xmath9 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath10 as the _ accumulation exponent_. * protein number is conserved at cell division , and protein degradation is much slower than a typical interdivision time  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the copy number of a given type of protein in the cell and @xmath12 the copy number ratio between the daughter and parent cells , both at the end of the @xmath1 generation .",
    "incorporating the features listed above gives rise to the recursion relation @xmath13 in bacteria @xmath12 is narrowly distributed about  1/2  @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath14 for now and discuss deviations from this assumption later .",
    "the solution of  ( [ eq : rate ] ) for arbitrary generation number @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the initial copy number .",
    "then @xmath18 the mean of  @xmath19 should compensate for the decrease in protein number in the daughter cells caused by division ; otherwise copy numbers would be unstable , running off to unsustainably large numbers or falling to zero within a few generations .",

    "there is no stationary distribution for this process ; the mean and variance of @xmath22 vary with time ( or @xmath15 ) , even when @xmath23 exactly .",
    "this conclusion holds independently of the various distributions used ; all that matters is that fluctuations are independent between generations .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that a stationary distribution , as experimentally observed , can result only if some negative feedback is present .",
    "given this , we next introduce and analyze a modified model with effective feedback regulating protein accumulation , and following that we discuss its experimental justification and consequences .",
    "a given protein type in an individual cell has a well - defined typical copy number @xmath24 .",
    "its value is nonuniversal , depending on protein type , growth conditions and possibly other biological factors  @xcite .",
    "the stationary distribution shape must therefore be independent of @xmath24 .",
    "a natural extension of the growth - and - division model consistent with observations is the introduction of an accumulation exponent that is negatively correlated with protein number at the start of the cycle .",
    "the experimental requirement of universality constrains the form of the feedback term : a change in scale of @xmath24 can not alter the functional form of the recursion relation . the only function with this property of scale invariance is the power law ;",
    "the modified recursion relation is therefore @xmath25(n_i/\\overline{n})^{-\\alpha}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 defined as before , @xmath26 ( which we will call the residual accumulation exponent ) the component of the accumulation that fluctuates independently from generation to generation , and a new phenomenological parameter @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the case without feedback  @xcite .",
    "the recursion relation of the modified model is @xmath29 it is not hard to check that first , there is now a limiting stationary distribution , with @xmath30 ; and second , that @xmath24 can be scaled out of the growth equations .",
    "the introduction of a nonzero @xmath31 makes the specific form of the limiting distribution dependent ( though not too sensitively ; see below ) on the distributions of @xmath12 and @xmath32 .",
    "experiments on bacteria indicate that @xmath32 is approximately normally distributed ( see fig .",
    "using this , we can solve for the limiting distribution exactly when the division ratio is fixed .",
    "the limiting distribution is again lognormal : @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these two parameters together determine the mean and variance of the distribution : specifically , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "however , only @xmath38 determines the shape of the distribution ; different values of @xmath39 collapse on one another following scaling by a linear transformation .",
    "moreover , for fixed @xmath38 the variance scales quadratically with the mean .    in terms of the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lognormal ] ) has several important features .",
    "first , it preserves universality under scaling with respect to all variables that appear only in the parameter @xmath39 , because the distribution shape is independent of this additive term .",
    "consequently , all values of @xmath24 , @xmath8 , and division ratio yield the same distribution shape .",
    "second , as noted above a single composite parameter @xmath38 determines the shape of the distribution .",
    "@xmath38 characterizes the balance between the _ variance _ of accumulation exponents , which tends to drive the process to diverge , and the effective feedback parameter @xmath31 , which provides a `` restoring force '' .",
    "once @xmath38 is determined , both properties  collapse of scaled distributions and quadratic dependence of variance on mean  are preserved .",
    "third , it should be noted that in the setting of our model , the limiting steady state distribution equally well represents the time average over many generations of a single individual or the average at a single large time over a large population in which the individuals are evolving independently .",
    "the analysis above assumed a gaussian distribution of the accumulation exponents and a fixed value of the division ratio .",
    "we now explore the robustness of our conclusions . without these assumptions ,",
    "the lognormal solution will no longer be exact , but will not be significantly altered for a variety of unimodal distributions for both variables .",
    "moreover , the scaling properties within classes characterized by @xmath38 ( defined as before and which is now close to but not exactly equal to the standard deviation of @xmath40 ) still hold .",
    "1a shows examples of means and variances computed from many simulations , in which the @xmath12 s were drawn from a gaussian distribution and the @xmath32 s from a gamma  distribution . for each simulation , @xmath31 and @xmath41",

    "the distributions from all simulations collapse after rescaling onto a single curve .",
    "thus , both properties of distribution collapse and the quadratic dependence of variance on mean hold once @xmath38 is fixed , even though the conditions of the exactly solvable model are relaxed .",
    "in addition , the assumption of symmetric division can be relaxed as long as the average accumulation compensates for the loss at division .",

    "we note that this is not a fit , but a model prediction with no adjustable parameters : the single parameter determining the distribution shape is computed separately using the single - cell dynamic measurements .",
    "motivated by experiments that found universal protein distributions under various conditions in yeast and bacteria , and by single - cell measurements of protein accumulation and division in bacteria across multiple generations , we have presented a model based on the premise that the combined processes of growth , division , and feedback set the distribution shape . with fixed division ratio and gaussian randomness the model is exactly solvable .",
    "the solution identifies a single parameter @xmath38  ( eq .  ( [ eq : lognormal ] ) ) defining the distribution shape : it quantifies the balance between growth of variance and feedback that stabilizes protein numbers . with",
    "@xmath38 fixed , a rescaling by mean and standard deviation collapses these distributions onto a single curve , and displays a quadratic relation between variance and mean .",
    "thus , our model predicts that populations in the same class  i.e. , which share the same shape parameter  exhibit similar set - point balance between the opposing forces in the dynamics of their protein content across time , i.e. between the _ variance _ of accumulation exponents ( @xmath50 ) that drive the process to diverge , and the feedback parameter ( @xmath31 ) that prevents divergence .",
    "therefore , if the variance of the exponents @xmath32 changes , the feedback parameter @xmath31 should change in a correlated manner . to test this prediction ,",
    "single - cell dynamical trajectories need to be measured over a variety of conditions that span these parameters .",
    "another possibility consistent with our model is that both @xmath50 and @xmath31 are fixed . at the moment , experimental perturbations",
    " for example , changing medium or temperature  can change the mean , for example by modifying the mean cell cycle time ; but their effect on the variance of exponents is unknown  @xcite .",
    "our approach shares some features with previous theoretical work but differs in other respects .",
    "earlier work focused on protein accumulation and division  @xcite , or protein accumulation and continuous dissipation  @xcite .",
    "the recent data on protein content over multiple generations  @xcite shows that , due to the exponential nature of protein accumulation , division or dissipation alone can not stabilize copy numbers , and reveal a correlation between variables across generations .",
    "the classes of proteins of interest are those consisting of high - copy - number molecules , characterized by exponential accumulation between successive cell divisions .",
    "the exponential accumulation of protein during a cell cycle suggests that protein production reflects a coherent integration of many correlated processes in the cell .",
    "exponential growth of the cell size between divisions , as well as negative correlation analogous to the one reported here , were measured in several recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , results on trapped bacteria show explicitly that the exponents of cell size growth and protein accumulation are strongly correlated on a cycle - by - cycle basis  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a picture where highly expressed proteins that are strongly coupled to cell metabolism are components of multi - dimensional phenotypes that covary between individual cells .",
    "this view is supported by a model recently proposed to explain exponential biomass growth as resulting from an interacting network of reactions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model is mathematically related to a recently proposed model of cell size regulation  @xcite , which finds under similar assumptions a lognormal distribution with the same compound parameter governing its shape . for highly expressed proteins ,",
    "this may be expected since protein production and cell growth are tightly coupled  @xcite . however , there are also important differences between the two models , which we address in detail in the appendix .",
    "our model addresses directly the universal behavior of bacterial protein distribution among different biological realizations , including expression regulation mechanisms , growth conditions , and types of microorganism .",
    "its ingredients are independent of specific biological mechanisms and rely on those general aspects of cellular events  exponential protein accumulation , division and feedback  that are likely to be common to all dividing cell populations .",
    "this marks a significant departure from the main current line of research on protein number variation , which investigates synthetically produced proteins while experimentally isolating the contribution of specific microscopic mechanisms  @xcite .    in particular",
    ", we have observed that feedback must be present , because without it the mean and variance necessarily drift to larger values as time increases .",
    "moreover , regardless of the specific processes leading to feedback ( which may differ for different protein types and organisms ) , the mathematical form of the feedback in a growth - and - division model must be power law to be consistent with universality .",

    "in this appendix , we detail the differences between our model and a mathematically similar model of cell size regulation recently proposed by amir  @xcite .",
    "however , before describing those differences , we first discuss some nontrivial consequences following from the _ similarity _ between the models .",
    "the fact that similar mathematical descriptions , albeit with different biological interpretations , may capture the dynamics of two distinct phenotypes is a potentially significant mathematical unification resulting from a strong coupling among disparate biological processes .",
    "as noted above , cell size and protein copy number are two separate , but strongly correlated , phenotypes of the cell . which one controls the other , or whether both are regulated together , is not known at this time",
    ". one interesting implication of the work presented here is that not only cell size , but also the total content of highly expressed proteins , is under the control of what appears to be a global cellular feedback , supporting the viewpoint that protein copy number variation is a _",
    "global _ variable .",
    "this marks a significant departure from the main current line of research on protein number variation .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of some important differences in the interpretation and consequences of the two models .",
    "first , the requirement that the average must scale out of the distribution shape in any model of universal distributions necessitates mathematically the power - law form of the feedback .",
    "second , the parameter @xmath38 that governs the `` universality class '' of the family of distributions has been identified , and its constancy leads both to the collapse of all curves under linear scaling and to the observed quadratic relation between variance and mean . the latter is an especially important consequence and has no analogue in cell size distributions .",
    "we have also seen numerically that the division into such classes extends beyond the conditions of the analytically solvable case , rendering this result robust with respect to a wide class of distributions of the underlying random variables .",
    "perhaps most importantly , our model makes specific predictions on the constrained changes allowed in protein trace parameters under varying conditions .",
    "similar predictions can not currently be made for cell size distributions .",
    "both our model and that of  @xcite are also easily modified to handle asymmetric division , as in yeast .",
    "however , until data are available that relate temporal to population statistics , it remains to be seen to what extent the dynamics of proteins across generations in yeast can be described by the approach outlined in the main text .     of the bacterial cell in the trapping channel .",
    "@xmath52 , computed from the data in  @xcite , is plotted vs.  @xmath53 .",
    "the red dashed line is the linear best fit given by @xmath54 .",
    "the slope , which represents the feedback parameter @xmath31 , is approximately 1/2 as predicted by the constant volume addition model described in  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] -4 mm      a final important difference between the approach described in this paper and that in  @xcite concerns the nature of the feedback itself .",
    "analysis of e.  coli data led to the conclusion that cell size feedback is characterized by @xmath55  @xcite , corresponding ( in leading order ) to the proposal that the feedback arises from constant addition of volume over the cell cycle .",
    "in contrast , a different mechanism(s ) may apply for copy numbers , and @xmath31 can in principle vary among protein types : our current results are consistent with various values of @xmath31 with an average of @xmath56 .",
    "however , at this stage there is no direct evidence that can determine which phenotype ( cell size , protein copy number , etc . )",
    "controls the division point of the cell and thus the feedback mechanism that controls it . in principle , it could also be a cellular state that is defined by several phenotypes simultaneously .",
    "we show this difference explicitly in the figure below .",
    "[ fig : cell ] uses cell size data from  @xcite to compute the feedback parameter @xmath31 , in manner similar to that used in fig .  2a , for the cell size phenotype .",
    "this results in @xmath57 , in agreement with  @xcite , but different from the value @xmath58 shown in fig .  2a .",
    "note that we use the term _ universal _ to describe these statistical properties of cellular protein content .",
