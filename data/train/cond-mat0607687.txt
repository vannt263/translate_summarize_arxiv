    "recent efforts to improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of automobile transport have focused on hydrogen - based fuel cells ( fc ) and internal combustion engines ( h@xmath7ice ) as possible replacements for current technologies powered by fossil - fuels.@xcite a significant obstacle to realizing this transition is the on - board storage of hydrogen at high gravimetric and volumetric densities.@xcite to achieve the storage densities necessary for mobile applications , novel means for h - storage are necessary , and a set of targets have been established to guide the search for new storage systems.@xcite at present no known storage material or mechanism meets these targets .",
    "one promising avenue for efficient storage of hydrogen is via solid state storage , such as in the form of complex- or metal - hydrides .",
    "solid storage has the advantage of providing volumetric densities beyond what can be achieved with compressed h@xmath3  gas or cryogenic liquid storage .",
    "however , all known hydrides suffer from one or more of the following limitations : low gravimetric densities , high h - desorption temperatures , or an inability to be easily re - hydrided .",
    "the search for new hydrides that overcome these limitations has attracted intense interest during the past 5 years .    towards these ends , recent experiments by pinkerton and co - workers@xcite and aoki _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite on the h - storage properties of the quaternary li - b - n - h system are noteworthy . by mixing lithium borohydride ( libh@xmath0 ) and lithium amide ( linh@xmath3 ) ,",
    "both groups have reported the formation of a new hydride phase , which when heated above @xmath11520  k released approximately 10 wt.% hydrogen . while the reported desorption temperature is somewhat too high , and reversibility has not yet been demonstrated , improvement in these areas may be possible ( and has been partially demonstrated@xcite ) through the addition of catalytic dopants@xcite or via novel synthetic routes,@xcite suggesting that further study of this system is warranted .",
    "the composition of the new li - b - n - h phase was preliminarily identified@xcite as `` li@xmath12bn@xmath7h@xmath13 , '' but subsequent experiments based on single crystal x - ray diffraction,@xcite and , synchrotron x - ray and neutron powder diffraction,@xcite identified its true stoichiometry as li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "combined , these diffraction experiments identified three similar crystal structures , all sharing the bcc space group @xmath14 with lattice constant @xmath15 = 10.6610.68   , but with somewhat different internal coordinates . the discrepancy in atomic positions results in n - h bond lengths that differ between structures by as much as 0.2   , with smaller n - h lengths reported for the x - ray structures .",
    "it has been suggested that the discrepancy may be an artifact of x - ray interactions with strongly polarized electron clouds along the n - h bond direction.@xcite    a careful characterization of a hydride s crystal structure is desirable because it enables an independent , _ ab initio _ assessment of the thermodynamics of hydrogen desorption / absorption reactions .",
    "such an assessment is of value because it can clarify the thermodynamics when calorimetry measurements yield ambiguous results , such as in situations where multiple reactions occur simultaneously ( see below ) . a key thermodynamic property which determines the suitability of a hydride for h - storage applications is the strength of the hydrogen - host bond .",
    "the bond strength is quantified via the change in enthalpy @xmath16 occurring during hydrogen uptake / release . in mobile fc applications , for example",
    ", it is desirable that the desorption reaction be _ endothermic _ @xmath17 with @xmath18 2050 kj/(mol h@xmath3 ) .",
    "neglecting kinetics , an enthalpy in this range would allow for h - desorption at temperatures compatible with the waste heat from a fc , and permit on - board recharging under reasonable h@xmath3  pressure .",
    "unfortunately , calorimetric measurements of h - desorption in li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  have been difficult to interpret .",
    "( see refs .   and , and the supplementary information accompanying ref .",
    "because li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  melts at @xmath11460  k , approximately 60 degrees below the onset of h - desorption , hydrogen gas evolves from the liquid state.@xcite concurrent with h@xmath3  release is the formation of a solid reaction product , generally involving one or more polymorphs of li@xmath1bn@xmath3  along with other unidentified phases,@xcite and desorption of 2 - 3 mol % ammonia.@xcite measurements based on differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc)@xcite and differential thermal analysis ( dta)@xcite suggest that the _ net _ heat flow during dehydriding is exothermic @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is unclear what fraction of the total thermal profile arises from the exothermic latent heat of li@xmath1bn@xmath3  solidification,@xcite and furthermore how h@xmath3  and nh@xmath1  release impacts the calorimeter response.@xcite consequently , it has not been possible to unambiguously assess the endo- or exothermic nature of h - desorption alone . neglecting kinetic effects",
    ", the fact that it has proven very difficult@xcite to re - hydride li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  suggests desorption is weakly endothermic , or exothermic .",
    "regarding li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  formation , several studies@xcite have reported the spontaneous formation of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  after mixing libh@xmath0  with linh@xmath3 , even at temperatures as low as room temperature , suggesting that the formation reaction is exothermic.@xcite    in light of the discrepancy noted above regarding the crystal structure of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 , and the additional ambiguity surrounding its dehydrogenation thermodynamics , we employ density functional theory ( dft)@xcite calculations in an attempt to clarify these issues .",
    "first , we determine the ground state crystal structure by performing separate geometry optimization calculations on each of the experimentally proposed crystal structures .",
    "we find that the relaxed structures are essentially identical , and have n - h bond lengths that are consistent with the structure based on neutron diffraction,@xcite thus confirming the conjecture@xcite that the anomalously short n - h bond lengths observed in ref .",
    "are an artifact of x - ray measurements .",
    "second , we evaluate the finite - temperature reaction enthalpies and free energies for the formation and dehydrogenation of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 . li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  formation ( with respect to linh@xmath3  and libh@xmath0 ) is found to be exothermic , in agreement with experimental reports of spontaneous li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  formation in the literature.@xcite for h@xmath3-desorption we explore the thermodynamics of seventeen candidate reactions over the temperature range @xmath20 01000  k , as there appears to be some uncertainty in determining the reaction products experimentally.@xcite at temperatures where desorption has been reported@xcite ( @xmath21 520 - 630  k ) , the favored reaction is predicted to be li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath22 li@xmath1bn@xmath3  + linh@xmath3  + 4  h@xmath3 , which is weakly endothermic",
    ". moreover , the calculated free energies suggest li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  is a metastable phase that should decompose via one of three temperature - dependent pathways .",
    "first - principles calculations were performed using a planewave method based on the pw91 generalized gradient approximation@xcite to density functional theory@xcite ( vasp).@xcite the core - valence electron interaction was treated using blchl s projector augmented wave ( paw ) method,@xcite and k - point sampling was performed on a dense monkhorst - pack@xcite grid with an energy convergence of better than 1  mev per supercell .",
    "( in the case of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 , a @xmath23 grid was sufficient to acheive this level of precision . )",
    "electronic occupancies were determined via a gaussian smearing algorithm with a 0.1  ev smearing width . for high - precision calculation of static zero kelvin ( omitting zero point vibrational effects ) electronic energies and crystal structures we used the so - called `` hard '' vasp paw potentials , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . ] with a planewave cutoff of 875  ev , and a geometry relaxation tolerance of better than 0.02  ev /  .",
    "internal atomic positions and external cell shape / volume were optimized simultaneously .",
    "finite - temperature thermodynamics were evaluated within the harmonic approximation.@xcite vibrational frequencies @xmath27 were extracted by diagonalizing a dynamical matrix whose elements were determined via the so - called direct method:@xcite the forces generated by series of symmetry inequivalent atomic displacements about the equilibrium geometry ( @xmath28   , @xmath29   ) were fit to cubic splines in order to extract the force constants . because large supercells are desirable to minimize finite - size effects , and with the exception of the molecular species ( h@xmath3 , n@xmath3 , nh@xmath1 ) where the number of atoms per supercell is small , the dynamical matrix calculations on the solid - state phases were preformed using a softer set of paw potentials and planewave cutoff energies ranging from 400500  ev . , and li@xmath3nh  at @xmath30  k agree with the hard paw results in ref .   to within 1  kj / mol f.u .",
    "third , testing revealed that the hard potentials yielded molecular vibrational frequencies which were in slightly better agreement with experimental data than those obtained with the softer paw set .",
    "for example , for n@xmath3 , where the differences between calculated vibrational frequencies are largest , we find 2338 ( 2452 )  @xmath31 from the hard ( soft ) paw sets , compared with an experimental value of 2359  @xmath31.@xcite however , this slight discrepancy in frequencies has only a small impact on vibrational thermodynamic properties  for example , zpes calculated with both paw sets differ by 0.7 kj / mol f.u .  at most .",
    "it therefore seems likely that an approach where _ all _ vibrational properties ( solids and molecules ) were evaluated using the softer potentials would also yield reasonably precise results .",
    "we thus conclude that our approach of mixing potentials gives results comparable in precision to those obtained with the hard paw set alone , but without the associated computational expense . ]",
    "a comparison of calculated structural parameters and formation energies with existing experimental and theoretical data is presented in the following section .",
    "once the normal - mode frequencies have been determined , finite - temperature energetics can be obtained by enthalpic ( @xmath32 ) and entropic ( @xmath33 ) additions to the static electronic energies . within the harmonic approximation",
    "these contributions are given by:@xcite @xmath34^{-1}\\\\ \\label{svib } s_\\text{vib}(t ) & = & k_b \\sum_i \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i / k_b t}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_b t}\\right ) -1}\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\ln\\left[1 - \\exp(\\frac{-\\hbar \\omega_i}{k_b t})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sums run over vibrational frequencies ( @xmath35 frequencies for solids and non - linear molecules , @xmath36 frequencies for linear molecules ) , @xmath37 is the boltzmann factor , and @xmath38 is the absolute temperature . for the linear ( non - linear )",
    "molecules an additional @xmath39 @xmath40 term is added to eq .",
    "[ hvib ] to account for translational , rotational , and @xmath41 degrees of freedom .",
    "the zero point energy ( zpe ) can be recovered from eq .",
    "[ hvib ] in the limit @xmath32@xmath42 .",
    "the enthalpy and free energy of a phase can therefore be expressed as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the static electronic energy of the crystal / molecule in its ground - state geometry and @xmath45 represents either the standard tabulated@xcite entropy of a given molecular species in the gas phase at @xmath46 bar [ @xmath47 130.858 ( h@xmath3 ) , 191.789 ( n@xmath3 ) , and 192.995 j k@xmath48 mol@xmath48 ( nh@xmath1 ) ] , or the vibrational entropy @xmath33  of a solid state phase .",
    "the crystal structure of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  has been studied by two groups.@xcite filinchuk and co - workers@xcite used single - crystal x - ray diffraction to identify the structures of the two largest crystal domains obtained after remelting a 2:1 mixture of linh@xmath3  and libh@xmath0 .",
    "both domains exhibited a bcc structure ( space group @xmath14 ) with lattice constants of 10.67 - 10.68   .",
    "chater _ _ et al.__@xcite used a combination of high - resolution synchrotron x - ray and neutron diffraction to examine powder samples prepared from a wide range of linh@xmath3:libh@xmath0  compositions .",
    "they determined that although the most likely stoichiometric composition was 3:1 , the li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  structure was able to accommodate a wide range of stoichiometries .",
    "their best - fit crystal structure had external cell parameters similar to those reported in ref .",
    ": bcc ( space group @xmath14 ) with @xmath49   . despite the good agreement in external geometries ,",
    "the structures obtained by these two studies differ markedly in their internal coordinates .",
    "most notably , the single - crystal x - ray diffraction study@xcite found anomalously short n - h bond lengths of 0.83 - 0.86   , while neutron scattering@xcite gave lengths of 0.98 - 1.04   .    .calculated structural parameters compared with experimental data .",
    "bond lengths ( @xmath50 ) and crystal lattice constants ( @xmath15 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) are given in  , bond angles ( @xmath53 ) and angles between lattice vectors ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) are listed in degrees .",
    "space group information for the solid phases is listed in parentheses . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the relatively large entropy of the gas phase products plays an important role in determining which reaction is favored at a given temperature .",
    "reactions yielding greater quantities of gaseous products should be favored with increasing @xmath38 , and this is consistent with the observed trend : reaction ( i ) , 2 mols @xmath4 reaction ( c ) , 4 mols @xmath4 reaction ( f ) , 5 mols .",
    "( it should be noted that at high temperatures  and certainly above the melting point of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2the harmonic approximation will no longer be valid , so we expect some decrease in accuracy with increasing @xmath38 . )    of the three favorable dehydrogenation reactions , only reaction ( c ) , li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  @xmath4 li@xmath1bn@xmath3  + linh@xmath3  + 4h@xmath3 , takes place within the temperature range where h@xmath3-desorption ( from undoped li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 ) has been experimentally observed ( @xmath56 520630  k ) . while our prediction of li@xmath1bn@xmath3  as a dehydrogenation product is consistent with experimental observations , we are not aware of any reports indicating the presence of linh@xmath3 .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that most experiments have been performed on off - stoichiometric li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  formed from 2:1 linh@xmath3:libh@xmath0  mixtures .",
    "mixtures with this composition are deficient in the li and n presumably needed to yield the additional amide present in our calculations .",
    "the calculated enthalpy for reaction ( c ) ranges from 11.2 to 12.8 kj/(mol h@xmath3 ) for @xmath6 300500  k , indicating that h@xmath3  release is a weakly endothermic process .",
    "for the higher - temperature reaction ( f ) , dehydrogenation is likewise predicted to be endothermic with a slightly larger enthalpy of @xmath1131  kj/(mol h@xmath3 ) . only the low temperature reaction ( i ) with @xmath57 @xmath58(1619 )  kj/(mol h@xmath3 ) is found to be exothermic .",
    "it would be interesting to test whether the predicted temperature - dependent decomposition sequence [ ( i ) @xmath4 ( c ) @xmath4 ( f ) ] could be observed experimentally by holding li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  at temperatures within each of the reaction regimes for long times .",
    "based on the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table  [ reactions ] , h@xmath3  desorption from li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  is thermodynamically favorable at essentially all non - zero temperatures : the negative free energies of dehydrogenation suggest that li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  is metastable with respect to decomposition via one of the reactions ( i ) , ( c ) , or ( f ) .",
    "on the other hand , experiments@xcite on pure li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  indicate that desorption does not take place until the temperature is raised above 520  k. taken together , these factors suggest that the relatively high temperatures needed in practice for h@xmath3-release are a consequence of poor kinetics , not unfavorable thermodynamics .",
    "an important distinction between our calculations and the experimental dehydrogenation of undoped li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  concerns the phase of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  present during the dehydrogenation reaction .",
    "as mentioned above , pure li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2releases hydrogen from the molten state.@xcite similarly , h@xmath3  release from other hydride phases , such as libh@xmath0 , also occurs from the molten state.@xcite due to the computational expense associated with obtaining precise energetics for liquids using dft , this study , and previous studies on libh@xmath0,@xcite have modeled the dehydrogenation reaction as a solid - state reaction . since the enthalpy of the liquid phase will be more positive than that of the corresponding solid phase , the calculated solid - state enthalpy of reaction ( c ) evaluated at the melting point ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 kj/(mol h@xmath3 ) , represents an _ upper bound _ on the enthalpy for desorption from liquid li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "it will be possible to more precisely estimate the magnitude by which @xmath10 is overestimated once the latent heat of melting for li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  has been measured .",
    "until such data become available , it nevertheless seems reasonable to conclude that the dehydrogenation of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  is either weakly endothermic , or exothermic .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the failed attempts at re - hydriding li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  reported thus far in the literature,@xcite as a small ( positive ) enthalpy of dehydrogenation will result in a similarly small thermodynamic driving force for re - hydriding . on the other hand , for li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  doped with pt / vulcan carbon,@xcite",
    "dehydrogenation begins below @xmath59 . in this case",
    "our approach of modeling solid state reactions more accurately captures the true phase behavior of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 , neglecting the possible formation of c- or pt - containing compounds .",
    "density functional theory calculations have been employed to study the crystal structure and the finite - temperature formation and dehydrogenation thermodynamics of li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "the calculations have resolved the discrepancies in hydrogen bond lengths between the separate structures determined via x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments , and suggest that the neutron data yields a slightly more accurate description of the crystal structure .",
    "all three of the reported experimental crystal structures relax to essentially the same structure .    for reaction energetics ,",
    "our calculations indicate that li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2formation is exothermic , and that the dehydrogenation enthalpy of solid - state li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  is temperature - dependent : h@xmath3  release is exothermic at low temperatures , and weakly endothermic at the higher temperatures probed by recent experiments .",
    "a non - zero latent heat for li@xmath0bn@xmath1h@xmath2  melting will reduce the dehydrogenation enthalpy from the liquid state ( relative to the solid state ) , but the size of this effect is still to be determined . to help clarify the identity of the phases produced via dehydrogenation we have performed a computational search over 17 candidate dehydrogenation reactions , and identified three reactions having favorable thermodynamics spanning the temperature range",
