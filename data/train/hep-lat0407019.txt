    "the yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath1 has a finite - temperature phase transition where the confined colorless glueballs deconfine in a gluon plasma .",
    "this transition is signalled by the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry related to the center @xmath3 of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is the polyakov loop which transforms non - trivially @xmath18 under a global center transformation characterized by the center element @xmath19 .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath20 is related to the free energy @xmath21 of a static quark as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath22 . in the low - temperature confined phase the center symmetry is unbroken , i.e.   @xmath23 , and",
    "hence the free energy of a single static quark is infinite . in the high - temperature deconfined phase ,",
    "on the other hand , the center symmetry is spontaneously broken , i.e.  @xmath24 , and the free energy of a quark is finite . integrating out the spatial degrees of freedom of the @xmath0-dimensional yang - mills theory",
    ", one can write down an effective action for @xmath25 .",
    "it describes a scalar model with global symmetry @xmath3 in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath3-symmetric confined phase of the gauge theory corresponds to the disordered phase of the scalar model , while the @xmath3-broken deconfined phase has its counterpart in the ordered phase .",
    "svetitsky and yaffe  @xcite argued that the interactions in the effective description are short ranged .",
    "hence , if the deconfinement phase transition is second order , approaching criticality , the details of the underlying short - range dynamics become irrelevant and only the center symmetry @xmath3 and the dimensionality @xmath2 of space determine the universality class .",
    "thus , one can exploit the universality of the critical behavior to use a simple scalar model to obtain information about the much more complicated yang - mills theory . on the other hand ,",
    "if the phase transition is first order , the correlation length does not diverge and there are no universal features . in this case",
    "the @xmath1-symmetric yang - mills theory in @xmath0 dimensions and the @xmath3-symmetric @xmath2-dimensional scalar model do not share the same critical behaviour .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath26 yang - mills theory has center symmetry @xmath9 and hence the effective theory is a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath9-symmetric scalar field theory for the real - valued polyakov loop .",
    "the simplest theory in this class is a @xmath27 theory with the euclidean action @xmath28 = \\int d^dx \\ \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } { \\partial}_i \\phi { \\partial}_i \\phi + v(\\phi)\\right].\\ ] ] the scalar potential is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 for stability reasons .",
    "indeed , for @xmath31 this theory has a second order phase transition in the universality class of the @xmath2-dimensional ising model .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath26 yang - mills theory is second order .",
    "in particular , one could imagine an effective potential @xmath32 , involving also a @xmath33 term which is marginally relevant in three dimensions .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 has to be positive in order to ensure that the potential is bounded from below , but the coefficient @xmath35 of the @xmath27 term can now become negative . then the phase transition becomes first order .",
    "the above argument extends straightforwardly to a generic gauge symmetry group @xmath1 with center @xmath3 .",
    "hence the order of the deconfinement transition is a dynamical issue that can be addressed only by lattice simulations .    the yang - mills theory on the lattice is naturally formulated in terms of group elements while in the continuum the fundamental field is the gauge potential , living in the algebra .",
    "an algebra can generate different groups , however it is natural to expect that lattice yang - mills theories whose gauge groups correspond to the same algebra have the same continuum limit .",
    "hence , instead of @xmath36 we consider its covering group @xmath37 . keeping this in mind , we look at the center subgroups @xmath3 of the various simple lie groups @xmath1 -.6 cm @xmath38",
    "-.2 cm numerical simulations in @xmath13 and @xmath14 dimensions have been performed for @xmath10 yang - mills theory in order to investigate the order of the deconfinement transition and  in case it is second order  to check the validity of the conjecture of svetitsky and yaffe .",
    "the currently known results are : + @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath26 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement transition .",
    "consistent with the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture , it is in the universality class of the @xmath40d ising model .",
    "@xmath10 yang - mills theories with @xmath41 have a first order deconfinement phase transition : hence there are no universal features .",
    "+ @xmath39 . lowering the dimensionality of space",
    "makes the fluctuations stronger .",
    "indeed @xmath10 yang - mills theories with @xmath42 and , perhaps , also @xmath43  @xcite have a second order deconfinement phase transition . also in these cases the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture is verified and one finds that the @xmath44d universality classes are , respectively , those of the ising , 3-state potts , and ashkin - teller models .",
    "however the branch of @xmath10 groups is not a good choice to study the relation between the order of the deconfinement phase transition and the size of the group .",
    "in fact , in this case , when increasing the size @xmath45 of the group also the center @xmath46 changes . in order to disentangle these two features",
    "we have considered the yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "since all @xmath6 groups have the same center @xmath9 , we now keep fixed the available universality class and we can directly study the relevance of the size of the group on the order of the deconfinement transition . finally , this also allows us to explore the deconfinement transition in yang - mills theories with a gauge symmetry different from @xmath10 .",
    "the results presented in these proceedings are published in  @xcite",
    "the group @xmath6 is the subgroup of @xmath47 which leaves the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath48 invariant . here",
    "@xmath49 is the imaginary pauli matrix and @xmath50 is the @xmath51 unit - matrix .",
    "the elements @xmath52 belonging to @xmath6 satisfy the constraint @xmath53 hence @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related by the unitary transformation @xmath56 : consequently , the @xmath57-dimensional fundamental representation of @xmath6 is pseudo - real .",
    "the matrix @xmath56 itself also belongs to @xmath6 , implying that in @xmath6 yang - mills theory charge conjugation is just a global gauge transformation .",
    "this property is familiar from @xmath7 yang - mills theory .",
    "the constraint eq.([pseudoreal ] ) implies the following form of a generic @xmath6 matrix @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are complex @xmath61 matrices such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "since center elements are multiples of the unit - matrix , eq.([group ] ) implies @xmath64 : hence , the center of @xmath6 is @xmath9 .",
    "writing @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a hermitean traceless matrix , eq.([pseudoreal ] ) implies that the generators @xmath66 of @xmath6 satisfy the constraint @xmath67 this relation leads to the following generic form , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath61 matrices such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath69 and @xmath70 have , respectively , @xmath73 and @xmath74 degrees of freedom , the dimension of the group @xmath6 is @xmath75 .",
    "there are @xmath8 generators of @xmath6 that can be simultaneously diagonalized and so the rank is @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath76 case is equivalent to @xmath26 , while the @xmath77 case is equivalent to @xmath78 , or more precisely to its universal covering group @xmath79 .",
    "the construction of @xmath6 yang - mills theory on the lattice is straightforward .",
    "the links @xmath80 are group elements in the fundamental @xmath81 representation .",

    "both the action and the measure are invariant under gauge transformations @xmath86 the polyakov loop is defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the extent of the lattice in euclidean time , which determines the temperature @xmath89 in lattice units .",
    "the lattice action is invariant under global @xmath9 center symmetry transformations @xmath90 , while the polyakov loop changes sign , i.e.  @xmath91 . as a consequence of the center symmetry",
    ", the expectation value of the polyakov loop always vanishes , i.e.  @xmath23 , even in the deconfined phase .",
    "this is simply because spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur in a finite volume .",
    "however , the polyakov loop probability distribution @xmath92 does indeed allow one to distinguish confined from deconfined phases . in the confined phase @xmath92 has a single maximum at @xmath93 , while in the deconfined phase it has two degenerate maxima at @xmath94 .",
    "if the deconfinement phase transition is first order , the confined and the two deconfined phases coexist and one can simultaneously observe three maxima close to the phase transition . at a second order phase transition , on the other hand , the high- and low - temperature phases become indistinguishable . the two maxima of the deconfined phase merge and smoothly turn into the single maximum of the confined phase .",
    "three coexisting maxima then do not occur in a large volume .    as physical quantities useful in the finite - size scaling analysis presented below",
    ", we also introduce the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath95 as well as the binder cumulant  @xcite @xmath96 the susceptibility measures the strength of fluctuations in the order parameter while the binder cumulant measures the deviation from a gaussian distribution of those fluctuations .",
    "we also consider the specific heat which takes the form @xmath97 in a finite volume @xmath98 has a maximum close to the critical coupling @xmath99 of the infinite volume theory .",
    "we denote the value of the specific heat at the maximum by @xmath100 .",
    "another interesting observable is the latent heat @xmath101 which measures the difference of the expectation values of the action in the confined and the deconfined phase . in the large volume limit @xmath102 and @xmath100",
    "are related by  @xcite @xmath103",
    "the @xmath6 lattice yang - mills theory with the standard wilson action can be simulated using the cabibbo - marinari method  @xcite of alternating heat - bath  @xcite and microcanonical overrelaxation  @xcite algorithms in various @xmath7 subgroups . in the next two subsections we report on the results of numerical simulations in @xmath11 and @xmath12 yang - mills theories in @xmath13d and @xmath14d .",
    "we denote with @xmath104 and @xmath105 the spatial and the temporal lattice extensions , respectively .      as a first step we have scanned the expectation value of the plaquette in order to check if the strong and the weak coupling regimes are separated by a bulk transition .",
    "fortunately , we find no bulk phase transition that might interfere with the study of the deconfinement transition both in @xmath13d and @xmath14d . our monte carlo data for the expectation value of the plaquette are compared with analytic weak and strong coupling expansions in figure  [ bulksp2 ] .    -1.4 cm    -.8 cm    in @xmath13d we observe a second order deconfinement transition , signalled by the broadening of the probability distribution of @xmath25 and , hence , by the increase of the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath106 at criticality",
    ". a finite size scaling analysis confirms the expectation that the universality class is that of the @xmath44d ising model .",
    "figure  [ fsschisp2_2 + 1 ] shows the collapse on a single curve of the data for @xmath107 collected on lattices of different sizes @xmath108 and at various couplings @xmath109 .",
    "the variable @xmath110 is a measure of the distance from the critical coupling @xmath111 .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are characteristic of a universality class : in this case they have been fixed to those of the 2d ising one . in figure  [ fsschisp2_2 + 1 ] we also plot rescaled data for @xmath26 yang - mills theory in @xmath13d which has a second order deconfinement transition in the 2d ising universality class .",
    "the two sets agree excellently .    -.8 cm    -1.2 cm    -.6 cm    in @xmath14d ",
    "contrary to what one might have expected   the probability distribution of @xmath25 in the critical region clearly shows the coexistence of the symmetric and of the broken phases .",
    "this indicates that the deconfinement transition is first order .",
    "figure  [ fsschisp2_3 + 1 ] shows the susceptibility @xmath106 as a function of the gauge coupling for different spatial sizes @xmath104 , keeping @xmath115 fixed .",
    "it clearly turns out that , at the critical coupling @xmath116 , @xmath106 scales with the spatial volume @xmath117 .",
    "this quantitatively confirms the first order nature of the phase transition .    -.8",

    "the linear behavior is characteristic of a first order phase transition .",
    "a linear extrapolation of @xmath118 to the infinite volume limit ( see eq.([speclat - heat ] ) ) is consistent with a direct measurement of @xmath102 .",
    "this again supports the first order nature of the transition .    -1.4 cm",
    "-.8 cm    we have also checked if the deconfinement transition for @xmath14d @xmath11 yang - mills theory remains first order in the continuum limit . to test for scaling ,",
    "we have measured the dimensionless ratio @xmath120 between the deconfinement temperature @xmath121 and the square root of the string tension @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "our data indicate that we are in the scaling regime , showing a scaling behaviour proportional to the lattice spacing squared .",
    "the results of @xmath11 yang - mills theory show that in @xmath13d fluctuations are stronger than in @xmath14d and the deconfinement transition is second order .",
    "expecting that the larger the group the weaker the fluctuations , we have also investigated the deconfinement transition in @xmath12 yang - mills theory .",
    "consistent with this picture , we find that in @xmath13 dimensions @xmath12 yang - mills theory has a first order deconfinement transition .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath25 in the critical region indeed displays the coexistence of the broken and of the symmetric phases .",
    "equivalently , one can say that , since the number of colorless glueball states is almost independent of the gauge group , the larger number of @xmath12 gluons w.r.t .",
    "@xmath11 gluons in the deconfined phase , increases the difference between the relevant degrees of freedom on the two sides of the phase transition .",
    "this drives deconfinement to take place with a discontinuous first order transition . in @xmath14d",

    "@xmath12 yang - mills theory deconfines with a first order transition .",
    "figure  [ polyhistorysp3_3 + 1 ] shows tunneling events between the coexisting symmetric and broken phases as a function of monte carlo time @xmath124 .",

    "-.1 cm    -1.6 cm    -1.cm",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath13d @xmath11 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement transition in the @xmath44d ising universality class . however ,",
    "@xmath14d @xmath11 , @xmath13d and @xmath14d @xmath12 yang - mills theories deconfine with a non - universal first order transition . hence",
    ", despite the fact that a universality class is available , yang - mills theory can have a non - universal first order deconfinement transition .",
    "a non - trivial center plays no role in determining the order of this transition .",
    "instead our @xmath6 and the @xmath10 results indicate that the order of the deconfinement transition is a dynamical issue related to the size of the gauge group .",
    "we conjecture that the difference in the number of the relevant degrees of freedom between the confined phase ( color singlet glueballs ) and the deconfined phase ( gluon plasma ) determines the order of the deconfinement transition .",
    "thus , we expect that in @xmath14d only @xmath26 yang - mills theory has a second order deconfinement transition ; in @xmath13d , due to stronger fluctuations , only @xmath10 , @xmath42 and , perhaps , @xmath43 , and @xmath11 yang - mills theories should have second order transitions . according to this picture , @xmath128 and @xmath129 yang - mills theories",
    "should also have a first order transition due to the large size of the groups : 78 and 133 generators , respectively .",
    "for yang - mills theories with trivial center gauge groups @xmath17 , @xmath130 , @xmath129  @xcite the large number of generators also suggests the presence of a first order transition even if no symmetry can break down .",
    "numerical results for @xmath17 yang - mills theory in @xmath14d indeed show the presence of a first order finite temperature phase transition . in figure  [ g2fittemp ]",
