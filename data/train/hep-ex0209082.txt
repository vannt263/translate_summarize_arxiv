    "among the various recent experimental results concerning neutrino physics , two of them give very strong hints for the existence of an oscillation mechanism and they are driving the main motivations for the future projects .",
    "the first one is the clear @xmath0 disappearance observed by super - kamiokande , soudanii and macro in the atmospheric data which can be very well described by the presence of @xmath1 oscillation .",
    "the best fit of this hypothesis to the latest super - kamiokande data gives the oscillation parameters @xmath2x@xmath3@xmath4 with @xmath5=1.0  @xcite .",
    "the range of allowed values at 90% cl correspond to 1.6x@xmath6 3.9x@xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath70.92 .",
    "the second result concerns the well established solar neutrino deficit for which a clear flavour change process has been demonstrated with the recently published sno data  @xcite .",
    "the solar observations are compatible with an oscillation process favouring again a large mixing angle but at a @xmath8 one order of magnitude less than for the atmospheric data .    at this stage",
    "it is very important to test in a conclusive manner an oscillation mechanism or not as the origin of those results .",
    "the primary goal of the first generation of long baseline projects is to confirm and verify the nature of the oscillations observed in the atmospheric data as well as to provide more precise measurements of the corresponding oscillation parameters .",
    "three projects using ` home - made ' @xmath0 are under progress .",
    "the k2k  @xcite and numi / minos  @xcite projects are looking primarily at @xmath0 disappearance using low energy beams , while the main goal of the cngs project described in this paper is to search for @xmath9 appearance in a high energy @xmath0 beam at 730 km from the neutrino source .",
    "the cngs  @xcite is a @xmath0 beam produced with 400 gev protons extracted from the sps complex at cern . during one year in a mode where the use of the sps is shared with lhc operation ,",
    "4.5x@xmath10 protons on target ( pot ) can be delivered , assuming 200 days of operation .",
    "the protons hit a target made of graphite rods and the produced secondary particles pass through a magnetic focusing system designed to select high energy ( 20 - 50 gev ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this makes the neutrino beam a high energy beam optimised for @xmath9 appearance with a mean neutrino energy of about 17 gev .",
    "[ fig : ebeam ] shows the expected neutrino energy distribution at gran sasso located at 732 km from cern .",
    "flux as a function of the energy at gran sasso .",
    "the curve shows the energy dependence of the production rate of @xmath13 s produced via charged current interaction for @xmath143x@xmath3@xmath4 at full mixing.,width=264 ]    in the gran sasso underground laboratory , the @xmath0 flux should correspond to 3.5 x @xmath15 @xmath16/year with a contamination of 2.1% @xmath17 , 0.8% @xmath18 and less than 0.05% of @xmath19 .",
    "the number of charged current interactions expected from @xmath20 is about 2600 /kton / year .",
    "if the @xmath21 oscillation hypothesis is confirmed the number of @xmath13 s produced via charged current interaction at the gran sasso is about 15 /kton / year for @xmath142.5x@xmath3@xmath4 at full mixing .",
    "civil engineering work is progressing well and it should be finished by spring 2003 .",
    "the accelerator team plans to deliver the first neutrino beam by may 2006 . the possibility of an increase of the neutrino beam intensity by a factor 1.5 is under study  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 appearance search is based on the observation of events produced by charged current interaction ( cc ) with the @xmath13 decaying in all possible decay modes . since the expected event rate is small , it is crucial to separate efficiently the @xmath22 cc events from all the other flavour neutrino events and to keep the background at a very low level . for this purpose the detectors will have to identify the events by exploiting the @xmath13 specific properties characterised by a non negligible lifetime and the presence of missing transverse momentum due to the final state @xmath22 produced in",
    "the @xmath13 decays .",
    "the two proposed detectors , opera  @xcite and icarus  @xcite , are using two different approaches for identifying the events .",
    "the choice made by opera is to observe the @xmath13 decay topology in nuclear emulsions , while icarus will separate the @xmath22 cc events from the background through kinematical criteria using a large volume tpc filled with liquid argon . the icarus and opera detectors will be installed in hall b and hall c , respectively , of the gran sasso underground laboratory .",
    "the 2400 meters of rock above the experimental halls provide a very efficient cosmic ray shielding .",
    "+ the detectors are described in more details in the following two sections .",
    "the principle of the opera experiment is to observe the @xmath13 trajectories and the decay products in thin layers of emulsion . to provide the large target mass ( 1.8 ktons ) the emulsion films are interleaved with 1 mm thick lead plates .",
    "[ fig : brick ] sketches the basic structure of the detector , called emulsion cloud chamber ( ecc ) .",
    "an emulsion film in opera consists of two emulsion layers ( 50 @xmath23 m thick ) put on either side of a plastic base ( 200 @xmath23 m thick ) .",
    "decay kink is reconstructed by using four track segments in the emulsion films.,width=264 ]      the basic detector unit , called ecc brick , is obtained by stacking 56 lead plates and emulsion films , plus an extra film before and another one , called changeable sheet ( cs ) , behind after 2 mm of plastic .",
    "the cs can be detached from the rest of the brick for analysis .",
    "it will be used to first locate the tracks produced in neutrino interactions which have to be followed in the rest of the brick .",
    "the dimensions of a brick are 12.5 x 10.2 x 7.5 @xmath24 . in terms of radiation length",
    ", a brick corresponds to a thickness of 10 @xmath25 .    in order to reach 1.8 kton target mass ,",
    "206336 bricks will be installed into walls containing 64 rows of 52 bricks and separated from each other by vertical planes of electronic target trackers .",
    "[ fig : opera2sm ] shows the general layout of the opera detector .",
    "it consists of 2 identical parts called super module ( sm ) .",
    "each sm has a target section and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer measures the charge and momentum of muons going through by means of a dipolar magnet providing 1.6 tesla transverse to the neutrino beam axis and equipped with drift tubes and rpc chambers .",
    "the target section is composed of 31 walls of bricks .",
    "the bricks will be installed in a support structure and manipulated from the sides of the walls using an automated manipulator .",
    "an electronic target tracker module composed of 2 planes of 6.6 m long scintillator strips in the two transverse directions ( x and y ) is installed behind each brick wall .",
    "the main goal of the electronic detector is to provide a trigger for the neutrino interactions and a localisation of the brick where the event occured .",
    "the strips , 2.6 cm wide and 1 cm thick , have wls fibers for readout by 64 channel multi - anode photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the brick transverse pointing accuracy is about 1.5 cm for cc events and 3.0 cm for nc events .",
    "the efficiency to find the right brick is about 70 - 80% .",
    "the candidate brick is then removed for subsequent analysis .",
    "the analysis flow is the following : the brick is removed using the brick manipulator system and the changeable sheet is detached and developped .",
    "the film is then scanned to search for the track originating from the neutrino interaction .",
    "if none are found then the brick is left untouched and another one is removed . when a neutrino event is observed , the brick is exposed to cosmics to collect alignment tracks before going to the development .",
    "after development the emulsions are sent to the automatic scanning microscope in order to start the analysis which consists of finding the neutrino vertex and the decay kink in the vertex region .",
    "the angular resolution for reconstructing a track in a film from the two emulsion layers is about 2 mrad .",
    "this is entirely limited by the scanning accuracy of the microscope stage and the digitisation .",
    "however this resolution allows a momentum measurement using the particle multiple scattering occuring within the lead plates .",
    "the difference of the track angles before and after lead sheets can be measured accurately all along the track .",
    "test beam results have shown that a resolution better than 20% for momentum below 4 gev can be achieved using only half a brick ( 5 @xmath25 ) with this angular method .",
    "the brick thickness ( @xmath26 ) and the high precision in reconstructing track segments makes the brick a good electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "[ fig : shower ] shows an electron shower reconstructed in a brick exposed to an electron beam at cern .",
    "the shower structure is clearly visible with all the segmets representing electron tracks from the shower seen in the emulsions .",
    "the efficiency to identify such showers is about 90% .",
    "the shower energy can be measured by counting the number of track segments reconstructed in a cone of 50 mrad around the incoming electron direction .",
    "this technique gives an energy resolution of 40%/@xmath27 .",
    "these results show the high capability of opera in @xmath28 decay studies and in the search for @xmath29 appearance .",
    "the @xmath13 decay channels investigated by opera are the e , @xmath23 and hadron .",
    "they are classified in 2 categories : long and short decays .",
    "the latter corresponds to the cases where the @xmath13 decays in the same lead plate as the neutrino interaction occured .",
    "those events are selected on the basis of the impact parameter of the @xmath13 daughter track with respect to the interaction vertex ( ip @xmath30 5 - 20 @xmath23 m ) .",
    "this is applied only for the electron and muon channels . in the long decay category",
    "the @xmath13 does not decay in the same lead plate and its track can be reconstructed in one film .",
    "the @xmath13 candidate events are selected on the basis of the existence of a kink angle between the @xmath13 and the daughter tracks ( @xmath31 20 mrad ) .",
    "table  [ tab : opera ] summarises the opera performance after 5 years of running with the cngs ( 2.25x@xmath32 pot ) .",
    "the number of expected signal events from @xmath21 oscillations is given as a function of the studied channel for three different values of @xmath8 at full mixing .",
    "the total efficiency including the branching ratios amounts to 9.1% and the total background is estimated to be less than 0.65 event .",
    "the main background sources are charm decays , large angle muon scattering and hadron reinteractions .",
    "a 4@xmath33 significance is achieved after 5 years for @xmath34 x @xmath3@xmath35 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the limit obtained by icarus at 90% cl on @xmath36 is @xmath37 after 5 years .    the recent analysis performed by opera and described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a limit of @xmath38 at 90% cl .",
    "both experimental results lead to significant improvement over the actual chooz limit and open an important window on the third mixing angle .",
    "the cngs construction is progressing well .",
    "the project is on schedule and a startup is expected for june 2006 . at the same time opera enters the construction phase and should be ready to take data by 2006 .",
    "icarus has successfully demonstrated its principle with the full scale 300 ton prototype technical run and the collaboration aims to build a 3000 ton detector by 2006 .",
    "+ the detector performances are such that an unambiguous @xmath21 appearance signal should be seen after only a few years of data taking . combining these observations ,",
    "the two experiments expect to see 20 - 25 @xmath13 events after 5 years with very little background at @xmath8 = 2.5x@xmath3 @xmath35 .",
    "they can achieve a measurement of @xmath8 with 10% accuracy . the very good electron identification and measurement of the two detectors give the possibility to explore the @xmath29 appearance channel pushing down the @xmath36 limit below @xmath39 .",
    "this may correspond to the best sensitivity that can be reached before the jhf program  @xcite turns on .",
