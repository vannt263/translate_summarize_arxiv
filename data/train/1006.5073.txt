    "since random - cluster models were introduced by fortuin and kasteleyn in 1969  @xcite , they have become an important tool in the study of phase transitions .",
    "the spin correlations of potts models are rephrased as cluster connectivity properties of their random - cluster representations .",
    "this allows the use of geometric techniques , thus leading to several important applications .",
    "nevertheless , only few aspects of the random - cluster models are understood in full generality .",
    "the _ random - cluster model _ on a finite connected graph is a model on the edges of this graph , each one being either closed or open .",
    "the probability of a configuration is proportional to @xmath6 where the _ edge - weight _ @xmath7 $ ] and the _ cluster - weight _ @xmath8 are the parameters of the model . for @xmath5 , this model can be extended to infinite - volume lattices where it exhibits a phase transition at some critical parameter @xmath9 ( depending on the lattice ) .",
    "there are no general conjectures for the value of the critical point .",
    "however , in the case of planar graphs , there is a connection ( related to the kramers - wannier duality for the ising model @xcite ) between random - cluster models on a graph and on its dual with the same cluster - weight @xmath2 and appropriately related edge - weights @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this relation leads in the particular case of @xmath12 ( which is isomorphic to its dual ) to a natural conjecture : the critical point is the same as the so - called _ self - dual point _ satisfying @xmath13 , which has a known value @xmath14    in the present article , we prove this conjecture for all @xmath5 :    [ critical_value ] let @xmath5 .",
    "the critical point @xmath15 for the random - cluster model with cluster - weight @xmath2 on the square lattice satisfies @xmath16    a rigorous derivation of the critical point was previously known in three cases . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the model is simply bond percolation , proved by kesten in 1980  @xcite to be critical at @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    ", the self - dual value corresponds to the critical temperature of the ising model , as first derived by onsager in 1944  @xcite ; one can actually couple realizations of the ising and fk models to relate their critical points , see @xcite and references therein for details . for modern proofs in that case , see @xcite or the short proof of @xcite . finally , for sufficiently large @xmath2 , a proof is known based on the fact that the random - cluster model exhibits a first order phase transition ( see  @xcite , the proofs are valid for @xmath2 larger than @xmath20 ) .",
    "we mention that physicists derived the critical temperature for the potts models with @xmath21 in 1978 , using non - geometric arguments based on analytic properties of the hamiltonian  @xcite .    in the sub - critical phase",
    ", we prove that the probability for two points @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be connected by a path decays exponentially fast with respect to the distance between @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the super - critical phase , the same behaviour holds in the dual model .",
    "this phenomenon is known as a _ sharp phase transition _ :    [ exponential_decay ] let @xmath0 . for any @xmath24",
    ", there exist @xmath25 such that for any @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "the proof involves two main ingredients .",
    "the first one is an estimate on crossing probabilities at the self - dual point @xmath29 : the probability of crossing a rectangle with aspect ratio @xmath30  meaning that the ratio between the height and the width is of order @xmath31  in the vertical direction is bounded away from @xmath32 and @xmath33 uniformly in the size of the box .",
    "this result is the main new contribution of this paper .",
    "it is a generalization of the celebrated russo - seymour - welsh theorem for percolation .",
    "the second ingredient is a collection of sharp threshold theorems , which were originally introduced for product measures .",
    "they have been used in many contexts , and are a powerful tool for the study of phase transitions , see bollobs and riordan @xcite .",
    "these theorems were later extended to positively associated measures by graham and grimmett @xcite . in our case , they may be used to show that the probability of crossings goes to @xmath33 when @xmath34 .    actually , the situation is slightly more complicated than usual : the dependence inherent in the model makes boundary conditions difficult to handle , so that new arguments are needed .",
    "more precisely , one can use a classic sharp threshold argument for symmetric increasing events in order to deduce that the crossing probabilities of larger and larger domains , under _ wired boundary condition _",
    ", converge to @xmath33 whenever @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , the theorem provides us with bounds on the speed of convergence for rectangles with _ wired boundary condition_. a new way of combining long paths allows us to create an infinite cluster .",
    "we emphasize that the classic construction , used by kesten @xcite for instance , does not work in our case .",
    "the approach allows the determination of the critical value , but it provides us with a rather weak estimate on the speed of convergence for crossing probabilities .",
    "nevertheless , combining the fact that the crossing probabilities go to @xmath32 when @xmath35 with a very general threshold theorem , we deduce that the cluster - size at the origin has finite moments of any order .",
    "it is then an easy step to derive the exponential decay of the two - point function .",
    "theorem  [ critical_value ] has several notable consequences .",
    "first , it extends up to the critical point results that are known for the subcritical random - cluster models under the exponential decay condition ( for instance , ornstein - zernike estimates @xcite or strong mixing properties ) .",
    "second , it identifies the critical value of the potts models via the classical coupling between random - cluster models with cluster - weight @xmath36 and the @xmath2-state potts models :    let @xmath37 be an integer ; consider the @xmath2-state potts model on @xmath38 , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the color at site @xmath22 and @xmath41 the set of edges of the lattice ) . the model exhibits a phase transition at the critical inverse temperature @xmath42    the methods of this paper harness symmetries of the graph , together with the self - dual property of the square lattice . in the case of the hexagonal and triangular lattice , the symmetries of the graphs , the duality property between the hexagonal and the triangular lattices and the star - triangle relation allow to extend the crossing estimate proved in section  [ sec : crossings ] subject to certain additional technical difficulties .",
    "the rest of the proof can be carried over to the triangular and the hexagonal lattices as well , yielding the following result :    [ triangular ] the critical value @xmath15 for the random - cluster model with cluster - weight @xmath5 satisfies @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , there is exponential decay in the sub - critical phase .",
    "there are many unanswered questions related to theorem  [ critical_value ] .",
    "first , the behaviour at criticality is not well understood in the general case , and it seems that new techniques are needed .",
    "it is conjectured that the random - cluster model undergoes a second - order phase transition for @xmath45 ( it is further believed that the scaling limit is then conformally invariant ) , and a first - order phase transition when @xmath46 . proving the above for every @xmath2 remains a major open problem .",
    "we mention that the random - cluster models with parameter @xmath19 @xcite or @xmath2 very large @xcite are much better understood .",
    "second , the technology developed in the present article relies heavily on the positive association property of the random - cluster measures with @xmath5",
    ". our strategy does not extend to random - cluster models with @xmath47 .",
    "understanding these models is a challenging open question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic ] we review some basic features of random - cluster models . section  [ sec : crossings ] is devoted to the statement and the proof of the crossing estimates . in section  [ sec : sharp_threshold ] , we briefly present the theory of sharp threshold that we will employ in the next section .",
