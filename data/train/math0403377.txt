    "floer homology can be seen as a vast generalization of the thom - smale - witten ( tsw ) complex to infinite dimension .",
    "we briefly recall below the construction of the latter @xcite .",
    "the resulting homology theory is called morse ( co)homology as a tribute to marston morse s pioneering use of critical points of smooth maps in the study of the topology of manifolds .    consider a morse function @xmath1 defined on a closed manifold @xmath2 and a riemannian metric @xmath3 which is generic with respect to a certain transversality property .",
    "one defines two complexes , one homological and the other one cohomological , by    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the notation @xmath4 stands for the space of parameterized negative gradient trajectories running from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , on which the additive group @xmath7 naturally acts by reparameterization . the transversality condition mentioned above concerns the transverse intersection of any pair of stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath8 .",
    "it ensures in particular that @xmath9 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the morse index of the nondegenerate critical point @xmath6 for the function @xmath12 .",
    "when the difference of the indices is equal to @xmath13 , a careful description of the relative compactness of sequences of trajectories proves that the quotient @xmath14 is finite .",
    "any choice of orientations for the unstable manifolds allows one to orient the trajectory spaces and algebraically count the elements of @xmath14 when @xmath15 is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "this gives a precise meaning for the expressions defining @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the crucial identities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are a consequence of a glueing theorem which constitutes , together with the analysis of the convergence of sequences of trajectories , a description of the compactification of @xmath20 by `` broken trajectories '' .",
    "finally , the homology of the above complexes is seen to compute the singular homology and , respectively , cohomology @xmath21 , @xmath22 . the most intuitive way to see",
    "this is to use the fact @xcite that the unstable manifolds give rise to a cw - decomposition of @xmath2 and use cellular ( co)homology as a bridge between morse and singular ( co)homology @xcite .",
    "we should mention at this point two important extensions of the preceding setup .",
    "firstly , the negative gradient vector field can be replaced by a vector field @xmath23 which is _ negative gradient - like _ with respect to a morse function @xmath12 i.e. @xmath24 outside the critical points of @xmath12 , which satisfies the same transversality condition and which is equal to @xmath25 near the critical points for some given metric @xmath3 . secondly , when the manifold @xmath2 is no longer compact , the same construction can be carried out if @xmath12 satisfies the _ palais - smale _ condition : every sequence @xmath26 such that @xmath27 is bounded and @xmath28 contains a convergent subsequence .",
    "the palais - smale condition can of course be formulated for a ( negative ) gradient - like vector field .",
    "for any two regular values @xmath29 of @xmath12 the complexes constructed on the critical points belonging to @xmath30 $ ] eventually compute the relative singular homology / cohomology @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "for any real number @xmath33 we have denoted @xmath34 .",
    "let us now describe the main lines along which hamiltonian floer homology of a closed manifold is constructed .",
    "this section recalls the construction presented in f. laudenbach s paper `` symplectic geometry and floer homology '' published in this same issue of the journal .",
    "a comprehensive reference is also provided by d. salamon s lecture notes @xcite , while the full details under the symplectic asphericity condition @xmath35 that we require henceforth are disseminated in several papers of a. floer @xcite .",
    "this assumption can be eliminated with moderate effort in the monotone case ( `` bubbles '' ) and with strenuous one ( `` virtual cycle technique '' ) in the general case , but it is suitable for this survey paper to simplify things .",
    "we henceforth assume @xmath36 , as well as @xmath37 in order for the conley - zehnder index of a periodic orbit to be well defined .",
    "let @xmath38 be a time - dependent hamiltonian and @xmath39 the hamiltonian vector field defined by @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 , @xmath42 be a loop of almost complex structures which are compatible with the symplectic form i.e. @xmath43 , @xmath42 are symmetric positive definite bilinear forms .",
    "we then have @xmath44 .    from a formal point of view",
    ", the construction of floer homology closely follows that of morse homology with the following analogies : @xmath45    @xmath46    let us make some comments before going on with the dictionary . for a contractible loop @xmath47",
    "we have denoted @xmath48 a map verifying @xmath49 .",
    "the symplectic asphericity implies that the action functional is well defined i.e. the quantity @xmath50 does not depend on the choice of the extension @xmath51 .    from a formal point of view , the analogues of the negative gradient trajectories of the finite dimensional case are maps @xmath52 only verifying equation ( [ equation floer ] ) . for finite - dimensional closed manifolds",
    "this automatically implies the convergence at @xmath53 to critical points of @xmath12 . on the contrary",
    ", when the dimension is infinite one has to impose a supplementary condition in order to ensure the convergence at @xmath53 to @xmath13-periodic orbits .",
    "this condition is precisely given by the finiteness of the energy ( [ energie trajectoire floer ] ) .",
    "the latter is in fact equivalent to the convergence at @xmath54 of a cylinder verifying ( [ equation floer ] ) .",
    "the minima of the energy are precisely the solutions of floer s equation ( [ equation floer ] ) .",
    "for any two orbits @xmath6 , @xmath5 of period @xmath13 let us denote by @xmath55 the space of maps @xmath56 that verify @xmath57 , @xmath58 with uniform convergence in @xmath59 .",
    "any element in @xmath60 satisfies    @xmath61    this is a consequence of the identities @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the minimum @xmath64 of the energy on @xmath65 is attained precisely by the solutions of equation ( [ equation floer ] ) and we denote @xmath66 the set of these trajectories . an element of @xmath66 will be called a _",
    "floer trajectory_.    a similar phenomenon occurs in the finite dimensional case : the negative gradient trajectories are the minima of the energy @xmath67 , defined on the space of maps @xmath68 that converge at @xmath69 to some given critical points of @xmath12 .",
    "the transversality condition that was mentioned in  [ subsection 1 ] can be rephrased in terms of a surjectivity property for the linearization of the equation of gradient trajectories @xcite : @xmath70 a similar transversality condition has to be verified in the infinite dimensional case in order for the spaces @xmath66 to inherit the structure of a finite dimensional manifold .",
    "the linearization @xmath71 of the equation ( [ equation floer ] ) has to be a fredholm map whose differential is surjective at solutions of ( [ equation floer ] ) .",
    "the fredholm character requires the use of suitable functional spaces for the elliptic analysis and holds if the @xmath13-periodic orbits of @xmath72 are nondegenerate .",
    "the surjectivity is satisfied for a generic choice of @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "our dictionary goes now as follows : @xmath74    let us remark that , unlike in the finite dimensional case , the hessian of @xmath75 at a critical point admits an infinite number of negative as well as positive eigenvalues .",
    "its `` morse '' index is therefore not well defined .",
    "this can be easily seen on the following example : consider @xmath76 on @xmath77 and the action of a loop @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "the positive and negative eigenspaces of this quadratic form are obviously infinite dimensional .",
    "in fact , this shows again that the classical morse theory is not adapted to the present context : it would come to glueing infinite dimensional discs along infinite dimensional spheres , which are contractible .",
    "the homotopical invariants of the corresponding spaces would vanish at any step of the construction .",
    "the conley - zehnder index is an integer that is associated to a path of symplectic matrices having the identity as origin and whose end does not contain the eigenvalue @xmath13 in its spectrum . to any periodic orbit @xmath80",
    "one can associate a conley - zehnder index by trivializing @xmath81 over a filling disc @xmath51 and by considering the path of symplectic matrices induced by the linearization of the hamiltonian flow along @xmath80 .",
    "the assumption @xmath82 ensures that two such trivializations are homotopically equivalent along @xmath80 and the integer @xmath83 will thus be independent of the trivialization .",
    "we explain at the end of this section why the suitable analogue of the morse index is the conley - zehnder index considered with negative sign , rather than simply the conley - zehnder index .",
    "if the transversality assumptions are verified , the implicit function theorem ensures that the dimension of @xmath84 at @xmath85 is equal to the fredholm index of @xmath86 .",
    "the identification of the latter with the difference between the conley - zehnder indices of the ends is a consequence of a characterization in terms of the spectral flow of a certain family of first order differential operators that is associated to equation ( [ equation floer ] ) @xcite .",
    "the only ingredient still lacking in order to formally define a ( co)homological differential complex in analogy with the tsw complex is a recipe to associate a sign to a floer trajectory running between periodic orbits whose conley - zehnder indices have a difference equal to @xmath13 .",
    "we shall not pursue this matter here and will just claim that _ there is _ one such recipe @xcite .",
    "one can alternatively work with @xmath87 coefficients in order to avoid all sign problems .",
    "definition . _",
    "the homological floer complex @xmath88 and the cohomological one@xmath89 are defined respectively by the analogues of equations ( . , . , . ) and ( .@xmath90 , .@xmath90 , .@xmath90 ) through the above dictionary .",
    "the grading is given by the opposite of the conley - zehnder index .",
    "_    the definition depends on the transversality results that we have mentioned above . in the case of a hamiltonian having nondegenerate periodic orbits , the almost complex structures for which these hold form a set @xmath91 which is of the second category in the sense of baire in the space of @xmath92-compatible almost complex structures .",
    "conversely , for any fixed family @xmath93 , the transversality results are valid for a second baire category set of hamiltonians @xmath94 . in finite dimension , this amounts to prescribe the metric and to choose a generic morse function : from the point of view of genericity , the metric and the function play symmetric roles .    in order to fix ideas ,",
    "all the remarks that are to follow will concern cohomology groups .",
    "the distinction homology - cohomology will gain importance only for manifolds with boundary .",
    "the definition will in that case contain as a supplementary ingredient an algebraic limit process which , according to the formalism being homological or cohomological , will be direct or inverse .",
    "the fundamental property of floer cohomology @xmath95 is its independence with respect to the hamiltonian and with respect to the almost complex structure .",
    "for any two pairs @xmath96 , @xmath97 which satisfy the above regularity conditions there is a homotopy of regular pairs @xmath98 , @xmath99 $ ] that links them together .",
    "any such homotopy induces an _ isomorphism _",
    "@xmath100 which , moreover , _ does not depend on the chosen regular homotopy . _",
    "the consequence is that one can identify floer ( co)homology with a classical topological invariant , namely singular ( co)homology .",
    "let us recall the relevant argument .",
    "consider a hamiltonian function that is time independent and morse .",
    "any critical point @xmath6 of @xmath72 is a ( constant ) @xmath13-periodic orbit and , in view of the convention @xmath101 , we infer @xmath102 , @xmath103 or , written in a different way , @xmath104 . when @xmath72 is small enough in the @xmath105 norm",
    "one can show that there are no @xmath13-periodic orbits other than the critical points of @xmath72 and , moreover , the floer trajectories ( solving @xmath106 ) that run between points whose index difference is equal to @xmath13 are in fact time independent @xcite .",
    "this means that the floer complex coincides with the tsw complex corresponding to @xmath107 . if the grading on @xmath108 is given by _ minus _ the conley - zehnder index , one gets the isomorphism @xmath109 we see in particular the interest of grading by @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 . in the latter case",
    "we would have obtained the isomorphism @xmath112 through the extra use of poincar duality @xmath113 .      the second big setting in which hamiltonian floer homology groups can be defined",
    "is that of _ compact symplectic manifolds with contact type boundary_. the main references on this topic are the papers by k. cieliebak , a. floer , h. hofer , k. wysocki @xcite and c. viterbo @xcite .",
    "i have used d. hermann s thesis @xcite with great profit due to the very clear exposition style .",
    "the paper of p. biran , l. polterovich and d. salamon @xcite contains results concerning the existence of periodic orbits representing nontrivial free homotopy classes . the weinstein conjecture and related problems",
    "are discussed in the book by h. hofer and e. zehnder @xcite .",
    "the initial motivation for the construction of floer homology groups was the existence problem for closed orbits of hamiltonian systems .",
    "roughly speaking , this problem has two distinct aspects : existence of closed orbits with a _ given period _ and existence of closed orbits on a _ given energy level_. historically , these two directions correspond to two conjectures of v.i .",
    "arnold @xcite ( 1965 ) and a. weinstein @xcite ( 1979 ) .",
    "the first claims that a lower bound for the number of closed orbits with fixed period on a closed symplectic manifold @xmath114 is provided by the rank of the ( rational ) cohomology @xmath115 . under the assumptions of the previous section , this follows from the very construction of the floer homology groups . since 1996",
    "there are proofs that work in full generality , with no extra assumptions on the underlying manifold .",
    "the second conjecture claims the existence of at least one closed orbit on a regular compact energy level @xmath116 which is of contact type .",
    "floer homology for manifolds with boundary is a tool that is particularly adapted to the study of this question (  [ weinstein ] ) , but we shall present two other fascinating applications in  [ poly ell ] and  [ stab ] .",
    "a ( compact ) hypersurface @xmath116 of a symplectic manifold @xmath117 is said to be of contact type if there is a vector field @xmath23 defined in a neighbourhood of @xmath116 , transverse to @xmath116 and verifying @xmath118 .",
    "the vector field @xmath23 is called the liouville field .",
    "the @xmath13-form @xmath119 is called the liouville form .",
    "if the liouville field is globally defined on the whole of @xmath114 we say that @xmath116 is of restricted contact type .",
    "the boundary of a compact symplectic manifold @xmath114 is said to be of ( restricted ) contact type if the above conditions are satisfied and the liouville field is outward pointing .",
    "the contact type condition is a symplectic analogue for convexity in the linear symplectic space @xmath120 : any compact convex hypersurface is of ( restricted ) contact type , as the radial vector field @xmath121 , @xmath122 satisfies the above conditions ( assuming @xmath123 is in the bounded component of @xmath124 ) . the conjecture has been formulated precisely in view of preliminary existence results on convex or star - shaped energy levels .",
    "a first proof for a contact type @xmath125 was given by c. viterbo @xcite and lots of other ambient spaces have been subsequently exlored .",
    "the contact type condition is related to holomorphic pseudo - convexity , as remarked by y. eliashberg , m. gromov @xcite and d. mcduff @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the reason why we impose that the liouville field be outward pointing .",
    "one should remark that this is automatically true if the boundary is of restricted contact type as the liouville field ( exponentially ) expands volumes .",
    "we give more details on pseudo - convexity in the sequel .",
    "floer homology groups of a manifold @xmath114 with contact type boundary will be defined with the help of hamiltonians that admit the boundary @xmath126 as a regular level . the invariants that we thus obtain will take into account not only the @xmath13-periodic orbits in the interior of the manifold , but also the closed orbits having arbitrary period on the boundary . as a consequence , they are well adapted to the study of weinstein s problem .",
    "let us stress from the very beginning that , unlike floer homology of closed manifolds which is finally proved to be equal to the singular homology , floer homology of manifolds with boundary has no similar topological correspondent .",
    "it is all the more important to exhibit in the latter case qualitative properties that are determined by additional geometric properties of the manifold .    here",
    "is how one retrieves closed orbits of arbitrary period on a contact type level with the help of @xmath13-periodic orbits in a neighbourhood of @xmath116 .",
    "note that the restriction of @xmath92 to @xmath127 has a one dimensional kernel on which @xmath128 does not vanish .",
    "if @xmath72 is an autonomous hamiltonian admitting @xmath116 as a regular level then @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    [ defi reeb ] the reeb vector field ( or characteristic field ) @xmath131 of @xmath116 is defined by the following two properties : @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "an orbit of @xmath131 is called a characteristic of @xmath116 .",
    "one should note that the area @xmath134 of a closed characteristic is equal to its period .",
    "moreover , the orbits of @xmath39 that are located on @xmath116 are in one - to - one correspondence with the latter s characteristics .",
    "it is important to understand that the hamiltonian dynamics on a regular level does not depend on the hamiltonian but on the level itself : it is more of a geometric nature rather than purely dynamic or analytic .",
    "let us denote by @xmath135 the flow of the liouville field .",
    "a whole neighbourhood @xmath136 of @xmath116 is foliated by the hypersurfaces @xmath137 with @xmath138 small enough . in view of @xmath139 ,",
    "the characteristics on these hypersurfaces are in one to one correspondence with those of @xmath116 .",
    "it is now comfortable to make a coordinate change via the symplectic diffeomorphism @xmath140 \\stackrel \\sim     \\longrightarrow      \\mc{v } , \\qquad \\delta > 0 { \\text{\\rm   small } } \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath141 verifying @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the restriction of @xmath144 to @xmath127 .",

    "its @xmath13-periodic orbits that are located on the level @xmath147 correspond to characteristics of period @xmath148 located on @xmath116 ( with the opposite orientation ) . by studying the @xmath13-periodic orbits of such hamiltonians one will have in fact studied characteristics on @xmath116 :",
    "the more important the variation of @xmath149 in the small interval @xmath150 $ ] is , the more characteristics one `` sees '' .",
    "any reasonable floer homology invariant for a manifold with boundary should take into account the topology of the manifold and _ all _ closed characteristics on the boundary .",
    "we thus retrieve the common underlying principle of the constructions in @xcite : the cohomology @xmath151 will be defined as a limit following an _ admissible family _ of hamiltonians , steeper and steeper near the boundary . as we have already warned the reader ,",
    "this limit is of direct or inverse type respectively , according to the choice of a homological or cohomological formalism .",
    "one supplementary refinement will consist in using a truncation by the values of the action , a crucial ingredient for the applications in  [ poly ell ] and  [ stab ] . before reaching them ,",
    "let us describe the various points of view already present in the literature .",
    "this definition was introduced by a. floer and h. hofer @xcite . in order to give a presentation in tune with the subsequent constructions we shall present below the cohomological setup , while the original point of view is homological .",
    "the two main features of this theory are the following :    1 .",
    "it is `` extrinsic '' in the sense that hamiltonians are defined on the whole ambient space @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "the definition is valid for arbitrary open sets , without any regularity or contact type hypothesis on the boundary .",
    "the class @xmath153 of admissible hamiltonians @xmath154 is defined by the following properties :    1 .",
    "[ one ] @xmath155 ; 2 .",
    "[ two ] there is a positive definite matrix @xmath156 such that @xmath157 uniformly in @xmath158 ; 3 .",

    "four ] there is a constant @xmath161 such that @xmath162 @xmath163    condition ( [ one ] ) `` pins down '' the hamiltonian along @xmath164 and allows it to ( steeply ) increase only in the neighbourhood of the boundary , according to the philosophy that we have detailed above .",
    "condition ( [ two ] ) prescribes the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath39 and , combined with ( [ three ] ) , ensures not only that all its @xmath13-periodic orbits are contained in a compact set , but also that the floer trajectories that link them together do not escape to infinity .",
    "this is a crucial point in proving floer compactness for open manifolds and we shall give more details on it in the context of the two constructions to follow .",
    "condition ( [ four ] ) is of a technical nature and plays some role in the proof of the @xmath165 estimates .",
    "one should note that condition ( [ two ] ) is to be interpreted as a kind of quadratic asymptoticity for @xmath72 .",

    "we have described three constructions and gave an application for each of them .",
    "the underlying idea - we have repeated it over and over - is to catch symplectically invariant information about the characteristics in terms of hamiltonians defined on the whole manifold .",
    "a first theme to keep in mind is that there is no `` best''construction and that each of the ones we have presented has virtues and shortcomings , which arise from the different behaviours at infinity or near the boundary that one imposes on the admissible hamiltonians .",
    "the paper of p. biran , l. polterovich and d. salamon @xcite develops at least three directions that are closely related to the ideas that we have discussed .",
    "the first of them is the construction of floer homology groups based on the @xmath13-periodic orbits belonging to a given free homotopy class of loops which is not necessarily trivial .",
    "the second direction concerns the modification of the class of admissible hamiltonians . the authors prove existence results for @xmath13-periodic orbits of compactly supported hamiltonians in cotangent bundles of flat tori and in cotangent bundles of negatively curved manifolds , under the only assumption that their value is prescribed and sufficiently large on the zero section .",
    "there is an interplay between direct and inverse limits for this class of admissible hamiltonians and the class of compactly supported ones , which allows the authors to construct _ relative symplectic capacities _ for the above types of cotangent bundles .",
    "their computation uses the results of pozniak @xcite on floer homology for hamiltonians whose periodic orbits appear in morse - bott nondegenerate families , like the ones in section [ coh floer boule ] above .",
    "a generalization of the above results for arbitrary cotangent bundles over closed manifolds is in progress by j. weber @xcite , using the computation of truncated floer homology groups for cotangent bundles @xcite .",
    "the paper by u. frauenfelder and f. schlenk @xcite studies the dynamics of compactly supported hamiltonians on completions of compact manifolds with contact type boundary or products of such objects - _ split - convex manifolds_. the main tool is a kind of symplectic capacity , or selector , associating to any hamiltonian a value in its spectrum .",
    "the selector is defined as the smallest value for which the image of the fundamental class of the manifold through a truncation morphism in floer homology vanishes .",
    "one interesting feature of the authors construction is that the emphasis is put on the hamiltonians rather than on some geometric levels , so that they need to consider only slow growths at infinity .",
    "applications include existence of @xmath13-periodic orbits for hamiltonians having a displaceable support .",
    "the main point is that displaceability implies uniform boundedness of the selector for all the iterates of the corresponding hamiltonian diffeomorphism .",
    "let us mention two directions for future research that seem promising .",
    "the first concerns the class of admissible hamiltonians prescribed for each of the homology theories that we have presented .",
    "their behaviour near the boundary @xcite or at infinity @xcite is used in a crucial manner in order to obtain a priori bounds on the floer trajectories but , in some sense , is too rigid .",
    "this becomes appearant as soon as one tries to perform geometric constructions on floer ( co)homology , related to additional geometric structure on the underlying manifold .",
    "as an example , the difficulty of the proof of the knneth formula ( [ kunneth cohomologie ] ) lies in the fact that the componentwise sum of two hamiltonians that are linear at infinity is no longer linear at infinity on the product manifold .",
    "it seems to me of interest to enlarge the class of admissible hamiltonians in the setting of @xcite , the main point being to still be able to prove a priori @xmath165 bounds .",
    "an extension in this sense was accomplished in the dissertation @xcite through hamiltonians that are asymptotically linear at infinity .",
    "this points to the investigation of new instances where the maximum principle can be applied , for example by allowing the almost complex structure to vary as well at infinity .",
    "a second interesting direction of investigation is to clarify the relationship between ( truncated ) floer homology and contact homology of the boundary .",
    "contact homology is a recent and powerful invariant that can be defined intrinsically for any _ contact manifold _ , in particular for the boundary of contact type of a symplectic manifold .",
    "this could lead to obstructions on the topology of symplectic fillings of contact manifolds ."
