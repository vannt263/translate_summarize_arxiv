    "an understanding of the fluctuation properties of systems away from thermal equilibrium plays an important role for a statistical mechanical theory of these systems .",
    "nonequilibrium fluctuations can have significant effects in small scale systems from physics to biology , which become more and more important in technological innovations .",
    "however , from a fundamental theoretical point of view , not much is known about the general aspects of nonequilibrium fluctuations , contrary to our understanding of equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the simplest generalization of the equilibrium state is a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) , which arises physically due to a balance between driving forces and dissipative forces acting on the system .",
    "one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems that can be maintained in a ness is a brownian particle , e.g. , a spherical colloidal particle in a fluid , confined to a harmonic potential which moves with constant velocity .",
    "in addition to the potential force the particle is subject to friction and thermal noise from the surrounding fluid . in this system",
    "the driving is due to the time - dependent force from the moving potential and the dissipation is due to the friction of the particle in the fluid . in order to maintain the ness one has to perform work on the particle , which , in turn , is partly dissipated in the fluid as heat , which has to be removed , and partly stored as potential energy in the harmonic potential .",
    "macroscopically , both the work done on the system as well as the heat removed from it have to be positive in the ness , while deviations from this macroscopic behavior arise due to fluctuations .",
    "the properties of the work fluctuations in this dragged particle model have been investigated experimentally and theoretically in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in particular with respect to the validity of the so - called steady state fluctuation theorem ( ssft ) ( cf .",
    "this theorem states that the probability distribution @xmath0 of observing a particular value of a scaled dimensionless work value @xmath1 over time @xmath2 satisfies a certain symmetry relation , which can be formulated as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath2 and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "( [ conventional ] ) represents a refinement of the second law in that it quantifies the probability of observing temporary second law violations ( negative @xmath1 ) in the ness .",
    "the ssft eq .",
    "( [ conventional ] ) for the work fluctuations has indeed been validated in the dragged particle model if the noise is modeled as thermal gaussian noise @xcite . yet",
    ", if the noise is modeled as lvy noise the work fluctuations violate the ssft and one can show that an _ anomalous fluctuation theorem _ @xcite holds .",
    "this result highlights the importance of explicitly verifying a general result , such as eq .",
    "( [ conventional ] ) , in concrete models .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the work fluctuation properties of the above mentioned ness model when the noise from the environment has the characteristics of external asymmetric poissonian shot noise ( psn ) , i.e. , it is given as a sequence of one - sided poisson distributed pulses with random amplitudes @xcite .",
    "psn is a natural description of fluctuations in nature @xcite and is ubiquitous , e.g. , in physics , electric engineering , and biology .",
    "importantly , psn generalizes the usual gaussian noise , to which it converges in a certain limit , and is a paradigm of _ external noise _ : the dissipation and the noise originate from physically independent mechanisms @xcite .",
    "this implies that the noise strength of psn does not have to be related to the friction by a fluctuation - dissipation relation , contrary to thermal noise in the case of brownian motion .",
    "psn allows us to investigate a number of important physical concepts in the context of nonequilibrium fluctuations : ( i ) _ time scales _ :",
    "psn introduces additional characteristic times in the system which crucially influence its fluctuation behavior ; ( ii ) _ symmetry _ of the noise : psn is usually asymmetric ( one - sided ) ; ( iii ) _ singularities _ : the asymmetry of the noise gives rise to an effective interaction between the noise and the potential , leading to an effectively nonlinear system with singular features .",
    "nevertheless , the work distribution can be calculated in analytical form in our model and is completely characterized by its time scales .",
    "the interplay of these time scales leads to certain transitions in the behavior of the work fluctuations , as discussed in a recent rapid communication @xcite .",
    "here , we present the full theory of ref .",
    "@xcite including inertial effects .",
    "moreover , we consider the case where thermal gaussian noise is superimposed on the psn .",
    "this gaussian noise models the effect of additional thermal noise on the particle , which might be relevant in an experimental realization of our model .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec_model ]",
    "we introduce the nonequilibrium particle model under the influence of one - sided psn .",

    "the work is partly dissipated as heat due to particle friction , and partly stored as potential energy in the potential . in the steady state the mean value of the work @xmath17 is positive , since we have to perform a macroscopic amount of work against the friction in order to maintain a ness .",

    "( [ trap ] ) for @xmath14 @xmath42 this means that the noise in our model is considered to consist of a random shot noise part and a deterministic part that is equivalent to a constant negative drift force on the particle .",
    "since the shot noise acts only one - sided by our convention , the noise @xmath14 is strongly asymmetric , even though its mean value is zero by construction .",
    "in contrast to the case of a brownian particle , the noise is here _ external _ , which implies that the friction coefficient @xmath13 is not related to the noise strength by a fluctuation - dissipation relation . in the absence of driving ( i.e. @xmath16 )",
    "the stationary distribution of the particle position is therefore not a thermal equilibrium distribution in general .",
    "however , in a certain limit the @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) does become gaussian noise , namely if we take the limits @xmath43 while keeping @xmath44 if this gaussian noise is considered to be thermal , i.e. , originating from an equilibrium heat bath , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem requires that this constant is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 can be interpreted as the inverse temperature of the heat bath .",
    "this leads to @xmath47 while all higher - order cumulants of @xmath14 are zero . in the limits of eqs .",
    "( [ g_limit])([g_limit_th ] ) , @xmath14 then represents the standard gaussian white noise of an equilibrium heat bath .",
    "the limit eq .",
    "( [ g_limit ] ) means that both the waiting time between successive pulses ( @xmath48 ) and their amplitudes ( @xmath22 ) become very small , i.e. , we have very frequent ( at every ` time step ' ) , independent , and very small pulses . this is the signature of gaussian noise .",
    "the system can then indeed reach a state of thermal equilibrium if @xmath16 .",
    "the system given by eq .  ( [ trap ] ) describes a damped harmonic oscillator with inertia , driven by a time - dependent force and by noise . for symmetric noise ( e.g. gaussian noise )",
    "the properties of the work fluctuations in this system are symmetric with respect to the direction of the pulling velocity @xmath11 , i.e. , the work distribution can only depend on the absolute value @xmath49 . however , the presence of asymmetric shot noise , prescribed by eqs .",
    "( [ f_poiss_noise ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , breaks this symmetry .",
    "since both the direction of @xmath11 and the direction of the noise ( given by the sign of @xmath50 ) can in principle be either positive or negative , there are in total four different combinations of the two .",
    "it is easy to see that the case @xmath51 and @xmath52 is symmetric with the case @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "likewise , the case @xmath51 and @xmath54 is symmetric with the case @xmath53 and @xmath52 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to discuss only two of the four different cases . in the following",
    "we investigate the work fluctuations for @xmath51 and @xmath53 , while @xmath52 always .",
    "the oscillator itself is completely characterized by the two time scales @xmath55 the inertial time , and @xmath56 the relaxation time .",

    "secondly , we can identify a time scale @xmath59 , defined as @xmath60 relating the mean amplitude of the pulses and the friction due to the driving , so that @xmath59 is the ratio of two independent external forces , due to the noise ( @xmath50 ) and due to the driving ( @xmath11 ) , respectively . in total",
    "there are therefore four different time scales in our model : the inertial time @xmath61 , the relaxation time @xmath62 , the mean waiting time @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "while the first two are intrinsic time scales of the oscillator , the latter two arise due to the particular type of external noise that we consider .",
    "we will see below that the four time scales @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath57 , and @xmath59 fully specify the properties of the work fluctuations in our model , and that the interplay of these times induces transitions in the qualitative behavior of the work fluctuations .",
    "one familiar example of such a transitional behavior is due to the interplay of the inertial and the relaxation times , eqs .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath68 for the transition from real to complex eigenvalues . if @xmath69 the eigenfrequencies are complex and the influence of the inertia on the dynamics manifests itself in time oscillatory behavior .",

    "the origin of this cut - off is the asymmetric form of the noise @xmath14 , eq .",
