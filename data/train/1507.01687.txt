    "evolutionary algorithms ( ea ) are a group of computational techniques , which employ the theory of natural selection to a population of individuals to generate better individuals .",
    "genetic programming ( gp ) is a paradigm of ea which uses hierarchical , tree structure , variable length representation to code solutions of a problem .",
    "gp can be used to intelligently search the solution space for finding the optimal solution of a problem .",
    "there are many gp tools ( lil - gp , genexprotools , gplab , ecj , open beagle ) @xcite developed by gp practitioners .",
    "however , none of these address the following demands of end user before applying them to solve symbolic regression problems : ( i ) ease of use and ( ii ) small learning curve .",
    "many of these tools are open source and available freely ( lil - gp , ecj , open beagle , gplab for matlab ) @xcite whereas the rest are available commercially ( genexprotools ) @xcite .",
    "many of these tools necessitate modification in source code in order to generate required experimental environment . determining the final solution , produced by these tools , demands translation of the output or digging the log files . due to these reasons , the interest of researchers and engineers in gp may get reduced .",
    "theses reasons motivated us to develop our own gp framework @xcite which uses the postfix notation for an individual representation .",
    "we have considered the following features which need to be supported by postfix - gp framework : ( i ) easy to extend , ( ii ) simple and quick procedure for the configuration and running of gp , ( iii ) a set of algorithm implementation for : ( a ) generating the initial population , ( b ) selection mechanisms , and ( c ) genetic operators , ( iv ) visualization of : ( a ) postfix - gp run analysis and ( b ) evolved solution with statistical measures , ( v ) one - step and multi - step prediction support , ( vi ) visualization of results for one - step and multi - step predictions , and ( vii ) storage and retrieval of evolved solutions to and from file .",

    "this is followed by conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "standard gp @xcite employs a variable length , tree structure scheme for an individual representation .",
    "the tree can be used to represent logical expressions ( if - then - else ) , boolean expressions ( and , or , not ) or algebraic expressions . the symbolic regression aims to find the functional relationship ( mathematical expression ) between given instances of inputs - outputs .",
    "gp can be used to perform symbolic regression ( sr ) . when using gp for solving symbolic regression problems , the user need to specify the following items : ( i ) gp configuration parameters , ( ii ) terminal set and function set , ( iii ) fitness function .",
    "the main steps of standard gp @xcite are as follows :    1 .",
    "random generation of an initial population of candidate solutions in tree form using the elements of function set and terminal set , selected by the modeler ( user ) .",
    "2 .   calculating fitness value of every individual of the population on the given training dataset ( fitness cases ) 3 .   selecting parents for mating based on the calculated fitness values , determined in previous step 4 .   applying sub - tree crossover and mutation ( genetic operators ) on selected parents for generating a new population of individuals .",
    "the process is repeated until the termination condition is fulfilled .",
    "the important features of the proposed postfix - gp are categorized into : ( i ) training dataset , function set , and terminal set related , ( ii ) gp parameters related , ( iii ) test dataset prediction related , ( iv ) gp run analysis related , and ( v ) serialization and de - serialization of gp experiments and results .",
    "training dataset , function set , and terminal set related features :    * loading of training dataset * loading of binary and unary functions * loading of constants    gp parameters related :    * selection of method to generate initial population * configuration of gp parameters like population size , number of generations , crossover rate , mutation rate * selection of crossover and mutation type * selection of selection scheme    test dataset prediction related :    * loading out - of - sample test dataset for one - step predictions * visualization of results of one - step predictions with statistical measures * loading out - of - sample test dataset for multi - step predictions * visualization of results of multi - step predictions with statistical measures    gp run analysis related :    * plotting best adjusted fitness vs number of generations * plotting average adjusted fitness vs number of generations * plotting solution size vs number of generations    serialization and de - serialization of gp experiments and results :    * serialization of gp parameters , function set , terminal set , and obtained solutions to a file * de - serialization of gp parameters , function set , terminal set , and obtained solutions from a file      this section presents the implementation details of postfix - gp .",
    "this will be useful to the reader in understanding and customizing the proposed postfix - gp framework . for details related to postfix - gp solution representation scheme , refer @xcite , @xcite .",

    "gp parameters can be set by the user either through genlab gui or through an xml ( configuration ) file .",
