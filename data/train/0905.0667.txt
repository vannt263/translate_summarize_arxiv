    "in the past two decades , strongly coupled matter under extreme conditions has been object of intensive study , as it must describe from the core of some neutron stars to important features of the early universe and heavy ion collisions experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is the understanding that hadrons are composed by asymptotically free particles that led to the idea that at sufficiently high temperature @xmath3 , and/or quark chemical potential @xmath4 , the hadronic matter should be described by quarks and gluons degrees of freedom @xcite , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "current lattice calculations strongly suggests that this phase transition actually happens , in the case of a vanishing chemical potential , at a temperature around @xmath5mev @xcite .",
    "the search for a phase transition in the case of a non - vanishing quark chemical potential has recently advanced , as a result of new techniques for lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "results from ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite , on the other hand , indicate that the qgp has already been produced , and that hydrodynamics is capable to describe the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the basic input for hydrodynamics is the equation of state eos , which must cover both the hadronic and the qgp sectors .",
    "the matter created in the heavy ion collisions has high @xmath3 and small @xmath4 , therefore the study of the eos at these conditions is of extreme importance for the hydrodynamics approach .",
    "the eos of the hadronic phase is currently described by the hadronic resonance gas model @xcite , with a good agreement to lattice data @xcite . for the deconfined phase",
    ", one needs an eos in terms of quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "qcd at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 is , in principle , the theoretical tool to compute the thermodynamics functions in this new phase .",
    "however , strict perturbation theory , which have been pushed to @xmath6 @xcite , is reasonable only for extremely high temperatures ; at temperatures near @xmath7 it seems not to be applicable , and alternative treatments appear to be necessary .",
    "moreover , the perturbative series seems to be weakly convergent @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is expected that when @xmath8 , the plasma behaves like an ideal gas of quarks and gluons , but the perturbative series converges at a slow pace towards this expectation .",
    "a way to circumvent this problem is through the reorganization of the perturbative series .",
    "for instance , there are attempts to reorganize the series using the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) effective action @xcite , in the form of so - called htl perturbation theory @xcite , and also attempts based on the 2-loop @xmath9-derivable approximation @xcite .",
    "the latter approach assumes a massive quasi - particle formalism @xcite .",
    "concomitantly , phenomenological models based on quasi - particles have had success in describing the lattice data @xcite , over a wide range of temperatures ( and at @xmath10 ) , in addition to being compatible with the fluid - like behavior found at rhic @xcite .",
    "more recently , a quasi - particle model for the quark - gluon plasma ( qqgp ) for a non - vanishing @xmath4 has also been worked out @xcite , with a satisfactory description of the lattice data . besides the quasi - particle approach",
    ", there are other treatments to describe lattice data near the transition region as , for instance , the polyakov loop enhanced nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite , which is able to fit lattice data quite well , even when @xmath11 .",
    "the quasi - particle model of the quark - gluon plasma is a phenomenological model that assumes non - interacting massive quasi - particles which , with the aid of few parameters , like the thermal masses , is able to fit lattice qcd data over a wide range of temperatures @xcite : not only at extremely high temperatures , as in strict perturbation theory , or when @xmath12 , as in the htl perturbation theory , but also near @xmath7 . indeed",
    ", quasi - particle models intend to describe deconfined matter from @xmath7 up to @xmath13 , although from the point of view of linking the qgp with hydrodynamics calculations , the reproduction of lattice data near @xmath14 is somewhat more important .",
    "the problem with the quasi - particle models is that the thermodynamics relations calculated from them are not consistent @xcite .",
    "its origin is in the use of standard statistical mechanics ( ssm ) @xcite with dispersion relations for quasi - particles that resembles the dispersion relations for free particles .",
    "contrary to the case of particles , quasi - particles have masses that are dependent on @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 .",
    "the first work to systematically study the consistency problem , and solve it for finite @xmath3 but zero chemical potential , was the one by gorenstein and yang @xcite . in their approach",
    ", it is built an effective hamiltonian which is composed of a part representing an ideal gas and a part representing contributions from the vacuum .",
    "this extra vacuum term leads to a modification in the pressure and in the internal energy of the system , but keeps the entropy and the number density untouched . in this way",
    ", a consistent thermodynamics for quasi - particles is obtained .",
    "most of the works in the literature are based on this approach @xcite .",
    "more recently , several authors have also turned their attention to the thermodynamics consistency of quasi - particle systems . in @xcite",
    ", the authors build an effective hamiltonian , @xmath15 , as before but require that the average of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are zero . as a result ,",
    "they get expressions for the thermodynamics functions of the same kind found in @xcite . on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "the particle mass is taken as an independent variable . in this case",
    ", it is also found a set of consistent thermodynamics relations .",
    "other possibility is presented in @xcite , where instead of keeping the entropy unchanged , as gorenstein and yang , the internal energy preserves its ssm definition , in a way that the consistency of the thermodynamics relations is also achieved .",
    "finally , a set of solutions for the thermodynamics of quasi - particles at @xmath10 was presented in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that the solutions of references @xcite are particular solutions of a general formulation .",
    "the next natural step is to extend this formulation to the case of finite @xmath4 .    in this work ,",
    "a framework for the thermodynamics of a system composed of quasi - particles whose masses are @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependent is developed , generalizing @xcite . at first sight ,",
    "a system composed of a mixture of fermions and bosons should follow the law of dalton for gas mixtures .",
    "this law states that _ the pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of all the components present in the mixture_. this statement holds exactly for ideal gases . for real gases ,",
    "however , the equality is approximated . as the quasi - particle approach is built on the ideal gas model",
    ", one would expect that the pressure for the whole system , i.e. for quarks and gluons , were the sum of the fermionic and bosonic parts , separately .",
    "in reality , this should not be true in the qqgp because the underlining theory is that of an interacting system .",
    "it makes no sense to fix the number of gluons @xmath18 , since no energy is expended for their creation ( @xmath19 ) . on the other hand if the pressure is computed from ref .",
    "@xcite , with a suitable debye mass , @xmath20 , and including fermions , it can be seen from the thermodynamics relations that the _ number of gluons _ will be different from zero @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the law of dalton fails here , implying that it is necessary to develop the theory for the whole system , and not for each part independently .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the general formalism for a consistent thermodynamics of quasi - particles in the grand canonical ensemble is presented . in sections iii and iv , particular solutions for this thermodynamics",
    "are computed , and in section v a comparison with perturbative qcd is made . in section",
    "vi , the comparison is with lattice qcd and , finally , the conclusions are presented in section vii .",
    "in the quasi - particle approach for the quark - gluon plasma , the system is described by an effective hamiltonian with mass terms that are dependent on @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "as widely known , early attempts to implement this idea run in a serious problem : an inconsistency in the thermodynamics relations . as shown by gorenstein and yang @xcite , it is not enough to use the hamiltonian of an ideal gas with the mass @xmath22 replaced by the effective mass @xmath23 .",
    "an extra term , @xmath24 , has to be added to the original hamiltonian : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is regarded as the zero point energy of the system .",
    "the extra term modifies the usual thermodynamics functions , healing the thermodynamics inconsistency of the system .",
    "thus , the most general form for the thermodynamics functions can be written as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the grand potential , @xmath29 is the internal energy , @xmath30 is the entropy , and @xmath31 is the average net quark number . the subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote fermions and bosons , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the dynamical masses acquired by fermions and bosons .",
    "the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitraries , but constrained by @xmath40 , to guarantee the consistency of the fourth thermodynamic relation in eqs .",
    "( [ phi - rel ] ) below .",
    "this condition is just the extension of the constraint obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependency of @xmath41 is assumed to be through the masses only .",
    "the extra term @xmath41 must be such that the thermodynamics relations    @xmath42    are valid .",
    "substituting the eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , ( [ u ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ n ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ phi - rel ] ) , one finds the following pair of differential equations :    @xmath43    using the connection between ssm and thermodynamics , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the grand partition function with hamiltonian @xmath46 , one can deduce the following equalities : @xmath47 and @xmath48 . using these expressions , and assuming @xmath49 , one concludes that the two equations in ( [ b.e.d - nao ] ) are the same .",
    "they are rewritten as :    @xmath50    for @xmath51 , the limit @xmath52 in eqs .",
    "( [ b.e.d - nao ] ) has to be taken with care .",
    "one obvious point is that the two equations for @xmath24 in ( [ b.e.d - nao ] ) give different results if one simply sets @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "but this is not the kind of solution that is expected for the quasi - particle mass . ] .",
    "when the grand potential has no extra term , the average number of particles and the entropy must have extra terms , i.e. if @xmath51 then @xmath38 and @xmath39 must be different from zero . if such condition is not fulfilled than the thermodynamics functions will not be consistent .",
    "this conclusion is based on the fact that the entropy and the average number of particles are obtained from the grand potential by eqs .",
    "( [ phi - rel ] ) .",
    "therefore the previous redefined thermodynamics functions are not valid when @xmath54 , and the modified thermodynamics functions must have the following form :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are    @xmath58    the solutions for @xmath24 given by eq .",
    "( [ b.sn ] ) are inversely proportional to @xmath39 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ phi - rel-0 ] ) are independent of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , differently from the @xmath49 case .    as in the canonical case @xcite , the physical meaning of @xmath59",

    "thus , one can add @xmath68 to @xmath62 in @xmath69 without inducing any change in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) . using this property",
    ", it is seen that eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) has the same definition as in the @xmath70 case : @xmath29 is given by the average value of the system hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the complete hamiltonian , particles plus vacuum , which must be used in the quasi - particle picture , is @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the zero point energy .",
    "the standard procedure of discarding the zero point energy can not be used here , since it results in uncompleted thermodynamics functions , causing an inconsistency .    for the average number of particles , the same manipulation ( as for the internal energy )",
    "can be applied to the @xmath31 quantum expression , where instead of adding a @xmath67 function to the hamiltonian , one adds it to the @xmath63 operator .",
    "thus , @xmath73 follows the same definition as in the @xmath70 : @xmath73 is given by the mean value of the total number operator , where the total number operator is @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "the extra term @xmath76 represents the number of particles associated with the zero point energy , which means that one can regard the zero point energy of the quasi - particle scenario , multiplied by suitable constants , as a mechanism to add or subtract particles from the system .",
    "these redefinitions imply the following thermodynamics functions :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the partition function with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that for @xmath81 , the statistical mechanics definitions for the entropy , the grand potential , the number of particles and the internal energy are the usual ones .",

    "the question is which one of the possible solutions is the most adequate . or , in other words , which one allows one to get the most from it with some minimum input .",
    "clearly , one can say that it is an advantage to work with simpler expressions , preferably with equations that allows one to make algebraic manipulations all over the calculation . and",
    ", of course , the adequate solution should be the one that reproduce _ both _ perturbative qcd and lattice qcd .",
    "besides , it is desirable to have a solution with a field theory analogue , as for instance the @xmath9 derivable approximation , in order to frame it in a stronger theoretical level .    from the solutions studied here , a whole class of them ( @xmath223 ) , which includes the gorenstein - yang type of solutions , have problems when a perturbative expansion is made .",
    "specifically , although the thermodynamics consistency is achieved for the full solution , it is lost order - by - order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this implies that this class of solutions are not able to reproduce perturbative qcd at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 in any scenario . of course , when trying to reproduce lattice data near @xmath7 , such problem does not appear because , in that case , the full solution from the flow equation for @xmath24 is used , and no order - by - order approximation is made . despite these problems ,",
    "the solution gy1 has on its side the fact that the entropy density and the particle number density preserve the same form of the standard statistical mechanics , exactly as in the @xmath9 derivable approximation . on the other hand , for the class of solutions with @xmath54 ( pressure is unchanged by the extra term @xmath24 while the other functions are modified ) , order - by - order thermodynamics consistency in the asymptotic limit is maintained and agreement with perturbative qcd is achieved .",
    "moreover , the lattice qcd data is reproduced down to @xmath224 .    in summary , a general consistent approach for the thermodynamics of quasi - particles at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 was presented for the first time .",
    "it was show that the only class of solutions for the thermodynamics functions capable to reproduce _ both _ perturbative and lattice qcd is the one where the pressure is not modified by the introduction of the extra term @xmath24 .",
