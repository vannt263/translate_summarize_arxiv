    "igr j17480@xmath22446 was discovered on 10 october 2010 in an integral monitoring observation of the galactic bulge ( bordas et al .",
    "the source was found to be consistent with the position of the globular cluster terzan 5 , which hosts the better - known transient and type - i x - ray burst source exo 1745@xmath2248 .",
    "an affiliation with exo 1745@xmath2248 was apparently strengthened with the detection of type - i bursts ( chevenez et al .  2010 ; strohmayer & markwardt 2010 ) .",
    "analysis of a prior _ chandra _ image of terzan 5 , and additional _ swift _ observations revealed , however , that the source was not exo 1745@xmath2248 , but rather a new transient source ( heinke et al .  2010 ; also see pooley et al .",
    "the source was subsequently given the name igr j17480@xmath22446 , in recognition of its discovery with integral ( ferrigno et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "detailed timing analysis shows that igr j17480@xmath22446 is an 11  hz pulsar ( strohmayer & markwardt 2010 ) .",
    "it also appears that igr j17480@xmath22446 evolved from an `` atoll '' into a `` z '' source , based on the path it traces in an x - ray color  color diagram and its rapid variability components ( including the possible detection of a khz quasi - periodic oscillation , or qpo , at 815  hz ; see altamirano et al .",
    "previously , only xte j1701@xmath2462 had been observed to evolve in this manner ( homan et al .",
    "slower , mhz qpos were also detected from igr j17480@xmath22446 , caused by recurrent weak bursts ( linares et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "neutron stars in globular clusters are of particular importance because the distance to globular clusters is often known precisely .",
    "this can eliminate a major source of uncertainty when estimating a blackbody emission radius .",
    "the distance to terzan 5 is likely 5.5  kpc ( ortolani et al .  2007 ;",
    "also see ransom 2007 ) .",
    "motivated by the rare opportunity to study a bursting neutron star in a globular cluster , we proposed a _",
    "director s time observation of igr j17480@xmath22446 .",
    "igr j17480@xmath22446 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ on 24 october 2010 ( obsid 13161 , seqnum 401282 ) , starting at 10:41:43 ( utc ) , for a total exposure of 30.0  ksec .",
    "the high energy transmission gratings ( hetg ) were used to disperse the incident flux onto the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) . to prevent photon pile - up ,",
    "the acis - s array was operated in continuous clocking or `` graded_cc '' mode , which reduced the nominal frame time from 3.2 seconds to 2.85 msec .",
    "this mode is subject to calibration uncertainties , partially owing to charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "the zeroth order flux is incident on the s3 chip , and frames from this chip can be lost from the telemetry stream if a source is very bright .",
    "we therefore used a gray window over the zeroth order aimpoint ; only one in 10 photons were telemetered within this region . for a longer discussion of this mode ,",
    "please see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "data reduction was accomplished using ciao version 4.1 .",
    "time - averaged first - order heg and meg spectra were extracted from the level-2 event file .",
    "redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) were generated using the tool `` mkgrmf '' ; ancillary response files ( arfs ) were generated using `` mkgarf '' .",
    "the first - order heg spectra and responses were combined using the tool `` add_grating_orders '' .",
    "the spectra were then grouped to require a minimum of 10 counts per bin .",
    "lightcurves of the dispersed photons were created using `` dmexract '' .",
    "spectra from periods with and without bursts ( see below ) were created by filtering the level-2 event file using `` dmcopy '' , specifying intervals derived using an independent code .",
    "all spectral analyses were conducted using xspec version 12.6.0 .",
    "all errors quoted in this paper are 1@xmath5 errors derived allowing all model parameters to vary simultaneously .",
    "the full 0.310.0  kev lightcurve of igr  j17480@xmath22446 was searched for bursts .",
    "figure 1 shows a segment of the total lightcurve ; several short , weak bursts are evident . chakraborty & bhattacharyya ( 2011 ) suggest that the bursts seen in this transient are type i bursts due to nuclear burning on the stellar surface , not type ii bursts due to an accretion disk process , as previously suggested by galloway & in t zand ( 2010 ) .",
    "theoretical work shows that mhz qpos can indeed be due to marginally stable nuclear burning ( heger , cumming , & woosley 2007 ) .",
    "we employed the search algorithm used by maitra & miller ( 2010 ) to flag bursts in the 0.310.0  kev lightcurve . in total ,",
    "35 bursts were identified , generally confined within 100200  s intervals .",
    "time - selected spectra were made using the procedure described above .",
    "preliminary fits to the spectra revealed a rather high column density , approaching @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason , the meg spectra are not very sensitive to narrow atomic lines .",
    "moreover , the flux calibration of the meg in the fe k band differs from the better - calibrated heg . as a result ,",
    "our spectral analysis focused only on the summed first - order heg spectrum .",
    "below 1.3 kev and above 9.0 kev , plausible continuum models leave residuals that are due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "more modest residuals are seen in the 1.73.0  kev band , likely owing to the complexity of modeling the effective area of ccds in the si k band , the ir coating on the _ chandra _ mirrors , and chip gaps that fall in this range .",
    "these features have little impact on the goodness - of - fit statistics .",
    "we therefore fit the heg spectra across the 1.39.0  kev band .",
    "although numerous bursts are evident in the source lightcurve , they are short - lived features that represent a small fluctuations on top of a high flux level",
    ". fits to the burst - free spectrum of igr j17480@xmath22446 yield results that are consistent with fits to the time - averaged spectrum ; the 0.510  kev flux in the burst - free spectrum is only 5% lower than in the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "( the line properties measured during bursting phases , in the burst - free spectrum , and the time - averaged spectrum , are also consistent . )",
    "owing to this consistency , we focused on the time averaged spectrum of igr j17480@xmath22446 .    the continuum can be described well using a simple additive model , consisting of a blackbody       component and a power - law , both modified by absorption along the line of sight . in xspec parlance , this model is `` tbabs*(bbodyrad@xmath7powerlaw ) '' , and it gives @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this model gives a column density of @xmath10 , a blackbody temperature of kt@xmath11  kev , a blackbody normalization of @xmath12 , a power - law index of @xmath13 , and a power - law normalization of @xmath14 .",
    "the normalization of the `` bbodyrad '' model gives a color radius of @xmath15  km ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance in units of 10  kpc ) ; this value is consistent with plausible stellar radii ( e.g. lattimer & prakash 2006 ) . extrapolating this simple model to the standard 0.510.0  kev soft x - ray band",
    ", it gives an unabsorbed flux of @xmath18 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath19 .",
    "figure 2 shows the combined first - order heg spectrum of igr j17480@xmath22446 , fitted with this continuum .",
    "the spectrum of igr j17480@xmath22446 shows clear residuals in the fe k band ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . a broad emission line , whether a simple gaussian line or a relativistic line , gives an improvement to the overall fit that is significant at far more than the @xmath20 level of confidence ( the f - statistic is @xmath21 ) . to characterize the absorption lines",
    ", we initially fit the broad line using a simple gaussian function .",
    "the gaussian model gives a centroid energy of 6.76(3 )  kev , which is broadly consistent with fe xxv .",
    "the line strength is typical of neutron star lmxbs , with an equivalent width of 112(9 )  ev .",
    "the width is measured to be 0.75(7 )  kev ( fwhm ) , or roughly 0.1@xmath22",
    ".    fits to the likely fe xxv absorption line with a simple gaussian give a line centroid energy of 6.77(1 ) kev , indicating a blue - shift of @xmath23  km / s ( for a rest energy of 6.700  kev ; verner , verner , & ferland 1996 ) . the gaussian fit nominally indicates that the line is resolved , with a width of @xmath24  ev or @xmath25  km / s .",
    "an equivalent width of @xmath26  ev is measured .",
    "this line may be saturated ; its properties may not be accurately measured using a gaussian",
    ".    fits to the likely fe xxvi absorption line with a simple gaussian give a centroid energy of 6.988(4 ) kev , indicating a       blue - shift of @xmath27 km / s ( for a rest energy of 6.966  kev ; verner , verner , & ferland 1996 ) .",
    "as figures 3 and 4 indicate , this line is quite narrow , and it is not resolved .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit on the width of this line is 13  ev or 600  km / s ( fwhm ) .",
    "an equivalent width of @xmath28  ev is measured for this line .",
    "this phenomenological continuum and complex of three fe lines gives a very good fit : @xmath29 .",
    "an apparent feature remaining at 6.1  kev is not statistically significant .",
    "the inconsistency of the velocity shift in the he - like and h - like lines could be real , but it may reflect possible saturation of the fe xxv line . if it is real , the fact that the he - like line  which likely arises further from the ionizing flux than the h - like line  has an _ higher _ velocity , may signal that the wind is being accelerated . assuming that the observed absorption occurs on the linear part of the curve of growth",
    ", the equivalent width of the fe xxv line implies a column of @xmath30 ; that of the fe xxvi line implies a column of @xmath31 .",
    "modeling the broad feature with a relativistic line function does not give a signicantly better fit , compared to fits made with a simple gaussian function .",
    "detecting asymmetry in a broad line requires high sensitivity ( see , e.g. , cackett et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; also see miller et al .",
    "2010 ) . fits with the `` diskline '' model give @xmath32 , or @xmath33  km for a 1.4  @xmath34 neutron star .",
    "this model also gives @xmath35 , @xmath36  kev , and an equivalent width of @xmath37  ev .",
    "the line emissivity index was fixed at @xmath38 , and the outer line emitting radius fixed at 1000  @xmath39 .",
    "we note that rxte observed igr j17480@xmath22446 on 24 october 2010 ( observation 95437 - 01 - 10 - 02 ) .",
    "the pca spectra appear to also reveal a broad emission line ( chakraborty & bhattacharyya 2011 ) .",
    "simple fits to the pcu2 spectrum ( including 0.6% systematic errors ) in the 325  kev band strongly require a line with a similar width ( @xmath40  kev , fwhm ) and strength ( ew@xmath41  ev ) , but pegging at the lowest plausible energy for fe k ( 6.40  kev ) .",
    "the radius given by the relativistic line fit permits a constraint on the stellar magnetic field strength . using equation ( 1 ) in cackett et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , making the same assumptions regarding geometry and the accretion efficiency , adopting an unabsorbed 0.130.0  kev flux of @xmath42 as the bolometric flux , taking a distance of 5.5  kpc ( ortolani et a.  2007 ) , and assuming a mass of @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 . for a neutron star with a radius       of 10  km",
    ", this gives a magnetic field strength of @xmath45 at the poles . if a value of 0.5 ( long et al .",
    "2005 ) is assumed for the conversion factor from spherical to disk accretion when balancing magnetic and ram pressures , the magnetic field at the poles would be @xmath46 . both values are consistent with estimates based on x - ray timing ( papitto et al .  2011 ) .      in order to better model the absorption found in igr j17480@xmath22246 , we constructed a grid of multipicative models using xstar version 2.2 ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) .",
    "the blackbody plus power - law model detailed above was extrapolated to the 0.130  kev band , and supplied to xstar as the source of ionizing flux .",
    "solar abundances were assumed .",
    "the outflow must be equatorial , owing to the lack of narrow emission lines in the spectra .",
    "we therefore assumed a global covering factor of 0.3 .",
    "last , the grids considered here assumed a number density of @xmath47 , consistent with values used to characterize other winds in x - ray binaries .",
    "direct fits to the combined first - order heg spectrum with the multiplicative table model strongly suggest that the fe xxv and xxvi lines observed can not arise in exactly the same gas .",
    "any single absorption zone that fits the fe xxv line well _ also _ predicts a strong fe xxvi line at a commensurate blue shift , which exceeds the shift measured from the observed fe xxvi line .",
    "similarly , any absorption zone that fits the observed fe xxvi line well , under - predicts the fe xxv line and fails to match its large observed blue - shift",
    ".    a plausible fit to the spectrum ( @xmath48 ) can be obtained using two absorption zones and a relativistic diskline model for the broad emission line ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the fe xxv line is well described by an absorber with @xmath49 , log(@xmath50 ) = 3.0 , at a blue shift of 3100  km / s .",
    "the fe xxvi line is well described by a slightly more modest absorber : @xmath51 , log(@xmath50 ) = 4.3 , at a blue shift of 500  km / s .",
    "the higher velocity absorption zone includes a strong fe xxvi line that is not evident .",
    "this may be explained if the blue wing of a relativistic emission line ( like that described above ) coincides with the fe xxvi absorption .",
    "the model described here is not unique ( for this reason , errors are not given ) , and slightly different relativistic emission line profiles and absorption zones can be combined to give similar outcomes .       assuming that the absorbing gas is a filled volume of uniform density , the ionization parameter can be used to derive a radius within which the wind must be launched ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the source luminosity",
    ", @xmath54 is the column density , and @xmath50 is the ionization parameter ) .",
    "even the more highly ionized absorber is relatively far away from the central engine : @xmath55  km , or @xmath56 ( assuming a neutron star mass of @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is within the binary system of igr 17480@xmath22446 : @xmath58  s , or @xmath59  km ( papitto et al .",
    "2001 ) , and consistent with the outer disk .",
    "the mechanical luminosity in a wind is given by @xmath60 .",
    "in practice , it is necessary to rewrite this equation in terms of the ionization parameter and a geometric factor : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass of the proton , @xmath63 is the fraction of @xmath64 covered by the wind ( @xmath65 is assumed in our xstar grids ) , @xmath66 is the wind velocity , @xmath67 is the ionizing luminosity , and @xmath50 is the ionization parameter .",
    "the faster , less ionized absorption zone gives a mechanical luminosity of @xmath68 , or @xmath69 .",
    "we have analyzed a _ chandra_/hetg observation of the transient x - ray pulsar and low - mass x - ray binary igr j17480@xmath22446 in terzan 5 .",
    "the fe k band can be decomposed into a broad emission line consistent with he - like emission excited at inner edge of a radially - truncated accretion disk , and blue - shifted he - like and h - like fe absorption lines that likely arise in an x - ray disk wind .",
    "the implications of a truncated inner accretion disk in igr j17480@xmath22446 and a disk wind are of particular interest , and they are explored in this section .    at 11  hz , igr j17480@xmath22446 is a much slower pulsar than e.g. sax j1808.4@xmath23658 , which has a frequency of 401  hz ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , and in which relativistic line spectroscopy and x - ray timing both imply a smaller inner disk radius and smaller stellar magnetic field ( cackett et al .  2009b ; papitto et al .",
    "2009 , hartman et al .",
    "2008 ) . in sax j1808.4@xmath23658 ,",
    "then , it is not surprising that the source shows khz qpos , which are often associated with orbits in the inner disk , and connections between the disk and the star .    at a flux level similar to that measured in this _ chandra",
    "_ observation ( after accounting for a distance disparity ) , altimirano et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported the detection of qpos at 48  hz , 173  hz , and 815  hz . if the fastest qpo signals a keplerian orbital frequency , a radius of approximately @xmath70 is implied .",
    "if the inner disk was still truncated at @xmath71 , then the khz qpos would have to be produced interior to the disk truncation radius .",
    "fourier - resolved spectroscopy has shown that the variable part of such spectra may originates in the boundary layer ( revnivtsev & gilfanov 2006 ) ; thus , it is possible that khz qpos originate in the boundary layer .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the disk simply extended closer to the neutron star when khz qpos were detected .",
    "the disk wind found in igr j17480@xmath22446 may be the clearest detection of such a flow in a neutron star system .",
    "iron absorption lines from highly ionized gas are clearly detected in a number of `` dipping '' neutron star systems , but this absorption is not typically blue - shifted , and likely occurs in the outer accretion disk of these nearly edge - on sources ( see , e.g. , diaz trigo et al .",
    "an ionized outflow is clearly detected in the persistent spectrum of gx 13@xmath71 ( ueda et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however , this source shows frequent dips , and this casts some doubt on the nature of the absorption .",
    "similarly , an ionized outflow is detected in circinus x-1 ( brandt & schulz 2000 ) , but it is difficult to rule out a massive companion wind as the source of the outflow .",
    "an ionized x - ray wind was detected in a _",
    "spectrum of the pulsar 1a 0535@xmath7262 ( reynolds & miller 2010 ) .",
    "the flow is likely a disk wind , but it is difficult to entirely rule out absorption in the wind of the massive b companion star in 1a 0535@xmath7262 .",
    "it is interesting to explore why disk winds are not regularly detected in the relatively large sample of persistent `` z '' and `` atoll '' neutron stars . a recent survey of _",
    "chandra_/hetg spectra does not find evidence for ionized outflows ( cackett et al .",
    "2009 ) ; in some cases the sensitivity of the spectra may have simply been insufficient .",
    "however , even in deep observations of cygnus x-2 , blue - shifted absorption is not reported in the non - dip spectra ( schulz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the outflow observed in igr j17480@xmath22446 may be a different kind of disk wind than those observed in stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the winds seen in stellar - mass black holes originate close to the black hole ( e.g. within @xmath72 ; see miller et al .  2006a , 2006b , 2008 ; kubota et al .  2007",
    "; neilsen & lee 2009 ) , and can carry away a good fraction of the accreting gas .",
    "thus , the winds in stellar - mass black holes may be at least partially driven by magnetic pressure ( see miller et al .",
    "in contrast , x - ray absorption in the disk wind found in igr j17480@xmath22446 originates two orders of magnitude further from the central engine ( measured in units of @xmath73 ) .",
    "the high ionization parameter of the wind in igr j17480@xmath22446 makes it unlikely that radiation pressure can drive the wind ( e.g. proga et al .",
    "2000 ) , but compton heating of the outer disk could plausibly drive such a wind ( e.g. begelman , mckee , & shields 1983 ) .",
