    "physical processes which exhibit a cyclic evolution play an important role in the description of quantum systems in a periodically changing environment . the system can present a classical description , such as a magnetic dipole precession around an external magnetic field , or quantum behavior such as the electron in a condensate , produced by collective motion of atoms . in this context , the role played by the electromagnetic vector potential is remarkable .",
    "the presence of a vector potential in a region where it does not produces an electric or a magnetic field in the configuration space of free electrons , can influence the interference pattern . considering a charged particle which propagates in a region with no external magnetic field ( force - free region ) ,",
    "it is verified that the corresponding wave function may develop a quantum phase : @xmath1 , which describes the real behavior of the electrons propagation .",
    "topological effects in quantum mechanics are phenomena that present no classical counterparts , being associated with physical systems defined on a multiply connected space - time @xcite .",
    "this issue has received considerable attention since the pioneering work by aharonov and bohm @xcite , where they demonstrated that the vector potential may induce measurable physical quantum phases even in a force - free region , which constitutes the essence of a topological effect .",
    "the induced phase does not depend on the specific path described by the particle nor on its velocity ( non - dispersiveness ) .",
    "instead , it is intrinsically related to the non - simply connected nature of the space - time and to the associated winding number .",
    "this is a first example of generation of a topological phase , the so called aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "many years later , aharonov and casher @xcite argued that a quantum phase also appears in the wave function of a spin-1/2 neutral particle with anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath2 , subject to an electric field arising from a charged wire .",
    "this is the well - known aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect , which is related to the ab effect by a duality operation @xcite .",
    "this phase is well established if the wire penetrates perpendicularly to the plane of the neutral particle motion .",
    "the ac phase and analogous effects have been studied in several branches of physics in recent years ( see for example the refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to study the quantum dynamics of these systems",
    "we must consider the full hamiltonian ( including the electromagnetic field sources ) .",
    "for example , when we are studying the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spin-1/2 charged particle in an electromagnetic field , it is common to neglect terms that explicitly depend on the spin , namely , @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms . however , these sources lead to singular solutions at the origin @xcite .",
    "hagen @xcite showed that there is an exact equivalence between the ab and ac effects when comparing the @xmath0 term in the ac hamiltonian with the @xmath3 term in the ab hamiltonian .",
    "he concluded that the @xmath0 term can not be neglected when we consider the spin of the particle @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath4 term was considered by shikakhwa _ et .",
    "@xcite in the scattering scenario",
    ". however , an analysis of the energy spectrum considering this term is not found in the literature .",
    "this is the main subject of present work , which aims to study the ac bound states .    in ab - like systems ,",
    "an interesting question which emerges nowadays is the study of the phase generation in real situations , such as in condensed matter , putting , for example , a wire in some material @xcite . to reproduce this scenario",
    "it is advisable to couple the charged wire to a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , and then analyze this influence on the dynamics of the neutral particle .",
    "the vibration of a crystalline lattice , in which the wire is embedded , is simulated by ho behavior @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze the ac problem taking into account the @xmath5 term in the nonrelativistic hamiltonian . using the self - adjoint extension method @xcite , we model the problem by boundary conditions @xcite and determine the expression for the energy spectrum of the particle and compare with the case where one neglects the such term .",
    "we also address the ac problem interacting with a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator located at the origin of a polar coordinate system and compare our results with those known in the literature . in sec . [",

    "in order to study the dynamics of a neutral particle with a magnetic moment @xmath7 in a flat space - time we start with the dirac equation ( with @xmath8 ) @xmath9\\psi=0 , \\qquad \\mu,\\nu=0,1,2 , \\label{eq : edirac}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the mass of the particle and @xmath11 is a four - component spinorial wave function and the @xmath12-matrices obey the commutator relation @xmath13 .\\ ] ] by introducing a spin projection parameter @xmath14 in 2 + 1 dimensions eq . reduces to a set of two two - component wave functions . in this case , the dirac matrices are conveniently defined in the pauli representation @xcite @xmath15 in this representation , the dirac equation is found to be @xcite @xmath16 \\psi = \\bar{\\mathcal{e}}\\psi,\\qquad(i=1,2 )   \\label{eq : deq}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the dual field and @xmath18 , @xmath19 . by applying the matrix operator @xmath20 \\beta\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "are in order .",
    "if we do not take into account the @xmath0 term , the resulting hamiltonian , in this case , is essentially self - adjoint and positive definite @xcite .",
    "therefore , its spectrum is @xmath31 , it is translationally invariant and there are no bound states the introduction of @xmath0 changes the situation completely .",
    "the singularity at origin due the @xmath0 , is physically equivalent to extracting this single point from the plane @xmath32 and in this case the translational invariance is lost together with the self - adjointness .",
    "this fact has impressive consequences in the spectrum of the system @xcite .",
    "since we are effectively excluding a portion of space accessible to the particle we must guarantee that the hamiltonian is self - adjoint in the region of the motion , as is necessary for the generator of time evolution of the wave function . the most adequate approach for studying this scenario",
    "is the theory of self - adjoint extension of symmetrical operators of von neumann - krein @xcite .",
    "the existence of a negative eigenvalue in the spectrum can be considered rather unexpected , since the actions of it suggest it is positive definite operator . however , the positivity of such an operator just not only depends on its action , but also depends on its domain .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 gives rising to a two - dimensional @xmath33 function potential at origin , and it is a well known fact that an attractive @xmath33 function allows at least one bound state @xcite .",
    "in particular , we analyze the changes in the energy levels and wave functions of the particle in the region near the charge filament . for this system , the commutator @xmath34 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the total angular momentum operator in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "so , the solution for the schrdinger equation can be written in the form @xmath36 ,    \\label{eq : eqref}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 , @xmath38 . by substitution eq . into eq .",
    ", the radial equation for @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 ,    \\label{eq : hzero}\\ ] ] @xmath43 with @xmath44 in what follows we assume that @xmath45 to ensure we have an attractive @xmath33 function with at least one bound state .",
    "since we are considering an infinite hollow cylinder of radius @xmath46 with charge density per unit length @xmath47 , is suitable to rewrite the short - range potential as ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath48 although the functional structures of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are quite different , as discussed in @xcite , we are free to use any form of potential provided that only the contribution of the form is excluded .",
    "now , the goal is to find the bound states for the hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian includes a short - range interaction @xmath50 modeled by a @xmath33 function .",
    "such kind of point interaction also appears in several ab - like problems , e.g. , ab problem of spin-1/2 particles @xcite , ac problem in a cpt - odd lorentz - violating background @xcite , in the coupling between wave functions and conical defects / cosmic strings @xcite , and coupling between wave functions and torsion @xcite .    to deal with the singularity point at @xmath6 , we follow the approach in @xcite .",
    "then we temporarily forget the @xmath33 function potential and find which boundary conditions are allowed for @xmath51 . this is the scope of the self - adjoint extension , which consists in determining the complete domain of an operator , i.e. , its complete set of wave functions . but the self - adjoint extension provides us with an infinity of possible boundary conditions and therefore it can not give us the true physics of the problem",
    ". nevertheless , once having fixed the physics at @xmath6 @xcite , we are able to fit any arbitrary parameter coming from the self - adjoint extension and then we have a complete description of the problem .",
    "since we have a singular point , even if @xmath52 , we must guarantee that the hamiltonian is self - adjoint in the region of motion for their domains might be different .",
    "the von neumann - krein method @xcite is used to find the self - adjoint extensions .",
    "an operator @xmath51 with domain @xmath53 is self - adjoint if @xmath54 and @xmath52 . in order to proceed with the self - adjoint extension",
    ", we must find the deficiency subspaces @xmath55 , with dimensions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are called deficiency indices of @xmath51 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath51 to be self - adjoint is that @xmath58 . on the other hand , if @xmath59 then @xmath51 has an infinite number of self - adjoint extensions parametrized by a unitary @xmath60 matrix , where @xmath61 .    the potential in this case is purely radial and we decompose the hilbert space @xmath62 with respect to the angular momentum @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 denoting the unit sphere in @xmath67 .",
    "the operator @xmath68 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath69 @xcite and we obtain the operator @xmath51 in each angular momentum sector .",
    "we have to pay special attention for the radial eigenfunctions , due to the singularity at @xmath6 .",
    "next , we substitute the problem in eq . by @xmath70 with @xmath71 labeled by a parameter @xmath72 which is related to the behavior of the wave function in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "but we can not impose any boundary condition ( e.g. @xmath74 at @xmath6 ) without discovering which boundary conditions are allowed to @xmath51 .    in order to find the full domain of @xmath51 in @xmath75",
    ", we have to find its deficiency subspaces . to do this , we solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given by eq . and @xmath78 is introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "the only square - integrable functions which are solutions of eq .",
    "are the modified bessel functions @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "these functions are square - integrable only in the range @xmath81 , for which @xmath51 is not self - adjoint , and the dimension of such deficiency subspaces is @xmath82 .",
    "so we have two situations for @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 to treat both cases of eq .",

    "the ac problem only has bound states when we take into account the @xmath4 , which gives an attractive @xmath33 function .",
    "in this section , we address the ac system plus a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) located at the origin of a polar coordinate system by using a same approach as in sec . [",

    "we have the free hamiltonian ( without the @xmath33 function ) with regular wave functions at origin and for @xmath236 the boundary condition in permit a @xmath237 singularity in the wave functions at origin .    for our intent , it is more convenient to write the solutions for for @xmath133 , taking into account both cases in simultaneously , as @xmath238 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 are the coefficients of the regular and singular solutions , respectively . by implementing eq . into the boundary condition , we derive the following relation between the coefficients @xmath141 and @xmath142 : @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the self - adjoint extension parameter for the ac plus ho system . in the above equation ,",
    "the coefficient of @xmath142 diverges as @xmath241 , if @xmath242 thus , @xmath142 must be zero for @xmath243 , and the condition for the occurrence of a singular solution is @xmath244 .",
    "so , the presence of an irregular solution stems from the fact the operator is not self - adjoint for @xmath244 , recasting the condition of non - self - adjointness of the previews sections , and this irregular solution is associated with a self - adjoint extension of the operator @xmath155 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the self - adjoint extension essentially consists in including irregular solutions in @xmath187 to match @xmath184 , which allows us to select an appropriate boundary condition for the problem .    in order to eq . to be a bound state ,",
    "@xmath245 must vanish for large values of @xmath198 , i.e. , must be normalizable at large @xmath198 . by using the asymptotic representation of @xmath139 for @xmath246 ,",
    "@xmath247 the normalizability condition yields the relation @xmath248 from eq .",
    ", for @xmath244 we have @xmath249 and by using eq .",
    ", the bound state energy is implicitly determined by the equation @xmath250 by comparing eq . with eq . , we find @xmath251 we have thus attained a relation between the self - adjoint extension parameter and the physical parameters of the problem .",
    "coincides with eq .",
    "( 53 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the ab system with the exact equivalence condition between the vector potential and electric field @xcite , i.e. , @xmath252 the limiting features of eq .",
    "are interesting . for @xmath253 or @xmath254 , from the poles of gamma function",
    ", we have @xmath255 these bound states energies coincide with those regular and irregular solutions given in eq . of the previous section . from relation the regular wave function , when @xmath256 and the @xmath4 is absent ,",
    "is associated with @xmath257 , and the irregular wave function , when @xmath258 , is associated with @xmath259 .",
    "like before , another interesting limit is that of the vanishing oscillator potential .",
    "so , using the limit in , we have @xmath260 with @xmath233 the self - adjoint extension for the usual ac system . from this equation",
    "we have the spectrum for the usual ac system in terms of the self - adjoint extension parameter , @xmath261^{1/|\\xi|}.    \\label{eq : energy_bg_pure}\\ ] ] this result also coincides with eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the ab system , with the exact equivalence cited above . by comparing this equation with we arrive at @xmath262 for the relation of the self - adjoint extension parameter and the physics of the problem for usual ac system .",
    "then , the relation between the self - adjoint extension parameter and the physics of the problem for the usual ac has the same mathematical structure as for the ac plus ho .",
    "however , we must observe that the self - adjoint extension parameter is negative for the usual ac , confirming the restriction of negative values of the self - adjoint extension made in @xcite , in such way we have an attractive @xmath33 function .",
    "it is a necessary condition to have a bound state in the usual ac system .",
    "it should be mentioned that some relations involving the self - adjoint extension parameter and the @xmath33 function coupling constant ( here represented by @xmath263 ) were previously obtained by using green s function in @xcite and renormalization technique in @xcite , both , however , lacking a clear physical interpretation .",
    "by modeling the problem by boundary conditions at origin which arises by the self - adjoint extension of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian , we have presented , for the first time , an expression for the energy spectrum of a spin-1/2 neutral particle with a magnetic moment @xmath7 moving in a plane subject to an electric field , i.e. , for the usual ac system taking into account the @xmath4 term , which features a point interaction between the particle and the charged line .",
    "the presence of the @xmath0 term , which gives rise to an attractive @xmath33 function for @xmath264 , ensures that we have at least one bound state .    as an application",
    ", we also addressed the ac problem plus a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator located at the origin of a polar coordinate system by including the term @xmath265 in the nonrelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "two cases were considered : ( i ) without and ( ii ) with the inclusion of @xmath4 in the nonrelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "even though we have obtained an equivalent mathematical expression for both cases , it has been shown that in ( i ) @xmath83 can assume any value while in ( ii ) it is in the range @xmath81 . in the first case ,",
    "it is reasonable to impose that the wave function vanish at the origin .",
    "however , this condition does not give a correct description of the problem in the @xmath6 region .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum obtained in the second case is physically acceptable .    finally , we determine the self - adjoint extension parameter for the ac plus ho and for the usual ac problem based on the physics of the problem .",
    "like showed in @xcite this self - adjoint extension parameter can be used to study scattering .",
    "the scattering in the ac system was studied in @xcite using other methods than self - adjoint extension .",
    "results in this subject using self - adjoint extensions will be reported elsewhere .",
