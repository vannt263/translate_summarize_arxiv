    "investigation of hadronic matter in extreme conditions of density and temperature is of relevance in physics since the knowledgwe of its properties will eventually lead to clarify some questions about fundamental interactions and the recovering of qcd symmetries @xcite .",
    "the role of strangeness in the evolution of relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite as well as in the dynamics of neutron stars @xcite has been stated long time ago . near the surface of a neutron star , where the density is of the order of the normal nuclear density @xmath1 , hadronic matter is mainly composed by protons and neutrons in @xmath0 equilibrium with electrons , in such a way that the whole system remains electrically neutral . at higher densities ( 2 - 3 @xmath1 ) hyperons",
    "could appear , decreasing the energy per baryon .",
    "further increasing of the density could cause the formation of different exotic phases composed of mesons condensates , quark matter lumps or quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the transition among phases are esentially pressure induced , and differs qualitatively when there are one or two conserved charges , _",
    "e.g. _ baryon number and electric charge @xcite .    in most hadronic matter studies ,",
    "the interacting particles are assumed as point - like . in an early work @xcite ,",
    "it was claimed the necessity to take care of the spatial extension of the hadrons and the influence of this fact on the collective phenomena at very high densities .",
    "it is worthy to mention that there are only a few field theoretical models which consistently includes the dynamics of the hadron volume , the most commonly used are the skyrme and bag - like models . in the first case",
    "the inclusion of finite baryon density effects is not straightforward due to the topological character of its solutions @xcite . on the other hand further refinements of the original mit bag model allows to deal with medium effects upon the hadron structure @xcite-@xcite .",
    "also in a recent work @xcite , attempts to include repulsion between overlapping bags was done through effective short - range quark - quark correlations .",
    "even when finite size hadrons are considered , the associated hard core repulsion among baryons in the nuclear medium is frequently not taken into account . at densities",
    "lower than @xmath1 finite volume effects are small , but these repulsive corrections could be very important at higher densities . for the case of hyperon matter , this fact affects the relative population of the different baryonic components .",
    "+ the main difficulty to deal with a hard core potential is that it does not admit a perturbative treatment at high densities .",
    "hence it would be desirable to have an effective treatment of these volume effects without leaving the simplicity of the quasiparticle approximation .",
    "we adopt a van der waals - like method to take into account finite volume corrections . in this scheme",
    "the total volume appearing in the thermodynamical quantities is replaced by the available volume , therefore it has the advantage that the volume of the particle is the only new parameter introduced to represent the hard core repulsive correlations .",
    "a similar approach has been used in related investigations , as for instance in references @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work we want to generalize the excluded volume corrections to study the properties of hadron matter with strangeness , and to check out to what extent the usual nuclear field effective models can be used to extrapolate the hypermatter equation of state at high densities .",
    "we introduce these corrections at the level of the normalization of the baryon fields .",
    "this point of view allows us to use the same effective lagrangians usually applied to describe the dynamics of point - like particles .",
    "therefore in the quasi - particle scheme of the mean field approximation for homogeneous matter , the baryons as a whole will be described by a superposition of relativistic plane waves , but they will move only within the accessible volume .",
    "we shall apply this approach to study the properties of homogeneous hypermatter in @xmath0-equilibrium at zero temperature . although the formalism is stated for the whole baryon octet , in order to clarify the discussions we shall only consider @xmath2 hyperons in our calculations , besides neutrons and protons .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear matter with lambdas has been previously investigated in non - relativistic @xcite as well as for relativistic @xcite regimes considering point - like particles .",
    "however a full treatment must include heavier hyperons , as deduced for example , from the influence of the @xmath3 particles on the stability of lambdas in medium @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we give a resume of the effective models to be used in our calculations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to extend these models to include correlations based in excluded volume restrictions . to compare the effects of the correction proposed ,",
    "we have selected two descriptions of very different kind . on one hand",
    "we select a hadronic lagrangian for point - like particles , the so - called zimanyi - moszkowski ( zm ) model @xcite , for which a fictitious size is assigned to the baryons , and on the other hand we have a bag model generalized to include quarks interacting with scalar and vector mesons , the quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite . in the last case",
    "two possible conditions for the equilibrium of the confinement volume in dense matter are proposed .",
    "all these items are discussed in section 4 .",
    "numerical results and discussion are given in section 5 , conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "relativistic hadron field theories have proved to be adequate in describing many nuclear matter properties at saturation density , and also finite nuclei structure , with a relatively small number of free parameters .",
    "these theories allow to extrapolate matter behaviour to high densities and energies .",
    "although a chiral treatment is desirable at high densities , we do not consider this issue in this work .",
    "there are a variety of effective relativistic lagrangians , the more usual ones describe nuclear interaction mediated by scalar ( @xmath4 ) , vector ( @xmath5 ) and pseudovector ( @xmath6 ) mesons @xcite .",
    "since neutral matter at high densities can be composed not only by nucleons and leptons but also with more massive baryons , we select a lagrangian of the form : @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac { 1}{2 } ( \\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma - { m_\\sigma}^2 \\;{\\sigma}^2 ) - \\frac { 1}{4 } f^{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac { 1}{2 } { m_\\omega}^2\\ ; \\omega^{\\mu } \\omega_{\\mu } \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac { 1}{4 } { \\bf g}^{\\mu\\nu } { \\bf g}_{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac { 1}{2 } { m_\\rho}^2\\ ; { \\bf b}^{\\mu}.{\\bf b}_{\\mu } + \\sum_l\\;\\left [ { \\bar{\\psi}}^l ( i \\gamma^{\\mu } \\partial_{\\mu } - m_l )   \\psi^l \\right ] \\label{lagral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([lagral ] ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the tensor strength fields of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons , respectively , and the index @xmath10 runs over all baryons ( leptons ) considered .",
    "the term @xmath11 contains the interaction of the @xmath4 meson with the baryonic fields @xmath12 , and plays the role of the baryon effective mass .",
    "the different forms of @xmath11 lead to a family of hadronic lagrangians . in order to have a general discussion @xmath11",
    "will be kept undetermined until needed .",
    "+ we solve the field equations for the case of homogeneous infinite static matter in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite . in this case",

    "+ all baryon and lepton species are assumed to be in @xmath0 equilibrium .",
    "this constraint and the condition ( [ charge ] ) determine the relative population of the particles . in the present work we consider only three baryon species , namely @xmath41 proton @xmath42 , neutron @xmath43 , lambda @xmath44 , and two lepton species , @xmath45 electron @xmath46 , muon @xmath47 .",
    "+ consequently chemical equilibrium is impossed through the following relationships among the chemical potentials @xmath48 : @xmath49 with @xmath50 , see eq .",
    "( [ partener ] ) , and @xmath51 .",
    "+ one solves the system of equations ( [ sigma ] ) to ( [ chemeq ] ) for a fixed value of the total baryon density .",
    "this determines the meson fields ( @xmath52 ) , the baryon and lepton densities ( @xmath53 ) , all the fermi momenta ( @xmath54 ) and chemical potentials ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "+ once the solution has been found , we can calculate the total energy density @xmath56 and the total pressure @xmath57",
    "effective lagrangians like the one in eq.([lagral ] ) , describe the long range behaviour of nuclear forces . at short distances , i.e. high densities ,",
    "the strong repulsive component of the baryon - baryon interaction appears as a consequence of the internal structure of the particles . in turn",
    ", this short range repulsion can be assimilated to a simplified model where baryons are described as extended objects over a spherical volume of radius @xmath58 , where @xmath58 reflects the range of the core repulsion .",
    "therefore the fraction of available space is reduced with respect to the case of point - like particles .",
    "a similar approach has been applied to study the phase transition of nuclear matter to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite and in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . + in our method we extend the van der waals prescription to take into account the finite size of different kinds of baryons including hyperons , at any finite density . for this purpose",
    "we shall use the effective lagrangian ( [ lagral ] ) valid for low densities , but the solutions arising from eq .",
    "( [ eulerlagr ] ) will be normalized within the available space .",
    "our approach is expected to be valid for densities such that the center of mass of baryons be at a distance greater than @xmath59 apart .",
    "otherwise the simple quasiparticle picture breaks down .",
    "+ thus we start from the plane wave solutions @xmath60 of the dirac equation ( 2.5 ) for fermions of spin projection @xmath61 carrying momentum @xmath23 , and normalized in a volume @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spinor free particle solution in @xmath65 space @xcite .",
    "an analogous expression holds for the antiparticle solution .",
    "+ we further assume that if particles have a finite size , then eq.(3.1 ) refers to the dynamics of its center of mass .",
    "since extended hadrons are assumed not to overlap their motion is restricted to the available space @xmath66 defined as @xcite @xmath67 with @xmath68 the total number of baryons of class @xmath16 inside the volume @xmath62 , and @xmath69 is the effective volume per baryon of class @xmath16 . hence if we renormalize the particle ( antiparticle ) wave function replacing @xmath66 for @xmath62 , the effective baryon fields @xmath70 read @xmath71\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a function of the fock space operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 , for particle and antiparticle respectively . in this way the finite size of the baryons is automatically accounted for into the field dynamics . + it is interesting to note at this point that a more detailed analysis shows that when we have a mixture of different baryons , the excluded volume is not exactly the same for all species , but depend upon their respective sizes @xcite .",
    "to simplify the discussions , in this paper we assume that the sizes of the baryons are similar for all the species considered ( see table 1 ) , and hence the excluded volume is , to a good approximation , the same for every particle .",
    "+ with respect to the effective volume per baryon @xmath69 , this quantity is expected to be proportional to the actual baryon volume , i.e. for spherical volumes of radius @xmath74 @xmath75 and for sharp rigid spheres @xmath76 is a real number ranging from @xmath77 , in the low density limit , to @xmath78 , which corresponds to the maximum density allowed for non overlapping spheres , in a face centered cubic arrange .",
    "since we wish to apply our method to study the high density behaviour of homogeneous isotropic matter , we shall adopt @xmath79 in all our calculations .",
    "thus @xmath80 and the upper limit for the baryon density is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the biggest radius among all present baryonic classes .",
    "+ in order to see how volume corrections appear in our approach , we shall use the renormalized field ( 3.3 ) to calculate the relationship between baryon densities @xmath28 and the fermi momenta @xmath31 + @xmath83 where @xmath84 has been used . +",
    "this result is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ vecdens ] ) , if the factor @xmath85 takes now the value @xmath86 for the case of finite baryon effective volumes @xmath69 . in the limit @xmath87 one",
    "recovers the point - like expressions .",
    "+ thus we can still use the same expressions we have calculated in section 2.1 with @xmath85 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) + equation ( [ densren ] ) shows that volume correlations couples non linearly the baryons among themselves , in a density dependent way .",
    "+ we can solve explicitly eq .",
    "( [ densren ] ) for @xmath88 as a function of all the fermi momenta @xmath31 , namely @xmath89 since @xmath85 in our approach depends explicitly upon the baryonic densities , the chemical potentials get an extra term , i.e. @xmath90 where @xmath91 , eq . ( [ partener ] ) , is the free quasiparticle eigenvalue and @xmath92 this value for @xmath93 is in agreement with the one used in the literature @xcite - @xcite .",
    "+ the expression for the energy density @xmath94 is formally the same given in ( [ energy ] ) , and the total pressure @xmath95 adquires an additional term @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) , and @xmath85 is evaluated according to eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) in all the expressions .",
    "+ in our approach only the baryonic states receive an explicit correction due to short range forces , through the normalization of the fields @xmath12 .",
    "this can be justified because meson fields contribute only through their mean values , which are completely determined from the baryonic sources .",
    "these sources already include finite size corrections in @xmath85 .",
    "leptons do not experiment strong interactions , and in this sense they are taken as point - like particles .",
    "to resume , in our approach to finite volume correlations , matter properties are determined applying the set of equations ( [ sigma ] ) to ( [ energy ] ) , together with ( [ pq])-([newpress ] ) for a fixed value of the total baryon density @xmath36 , but using the value of @xmath85 given in ( [ theta ] ) instead .",
    "in order to have definite predictions of finite size effects we apply the scheme described in section 3 , to the zm model @xcite . this is a local field model which basic degrees of freedom are point - like hadrons .",
    "this model has been extensively used to study nuclear matter and nuclei properties .",
    "it has the advantage of reproduce the main nuclear matter properties in the lowest order of approximation with reasonable accuracy , and using the minimum set of free parameters . in the zm model ,",
    "properly generalized to include several baryonic species , the effective baryon mass @xmath11 and its derivative @xmath99 are given by @xmath100 respectively .",
    "+ we place this expression for @xmath11 in the equations of sections 2 and 3 , to calculate the effects of finite size corrections in the thermodinamical bulk properties .",
    "+ if we take @xmath101 , section 2 , we describe a system of point - like baryons , and using @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , we include finite size effects . in the last case",
    "a fictitious volume of constant radius is assigned to each kind of baryons in order to contrast excluded volume effects with the point - like case .",
    "however , the high density results must be taken with caution since causality violation is expected due to the hard - core repulsion @xcite .",
    "this problem can be avoided if the baryon volume decreases with density as predicted by the model presented in the next subsection .",
    "+ numerical results will be given in section 5 .",
    "another baryon model we shall use is the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite .",
    "the qmc model may be viewed as an extension of the quantum hadro - dynamics ( qhd ) models like , for instance , the walecka @xcite or the zimanyi - moszkowski @xcite models . in the qmc model hadrons",
    "are represented as non - overlapping bags containing three valence quarks , the bag radius changing dinamically with the medium density .",
    "baryons are interacting by the exchange of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons that couples directly to the confined quarks .",
    "it has been found that these extra degrees of freedom provided by the internal structure of the baryon lead to quite acceptable values of the nuclear matter compressibility at saturation . despite the explicit quark fields present in the qmc model ,",
    "hadronic thermodynamical properties are evaluated in such a way that baryons are handled as point - like particles with an effective mass @xmath102 which depends on the @xmath4 field .",
    "+ to describe briefly the qmc model , one considers baryons as spherical mit bags where quarks are confined , the dirac equation for a quark of flavor @xmath103 , of current mass @xmath104 and @xmath105 third isospin component is then given by @xmath106 in this equation all meson fields have been replaced by their respective mean field values , in a similar way as we have done in eq.([eulerlagr ] ) for baryons in uniform hadronic matter .",
    "mesons are supposed to couple linearly only to @xmath107 and @xmath108 quarks , i.e. @xmath109 . therefore the effective @xmath110 masses are @xmath111 for a spherically symmetric bag of radius @xmath74 , representing a baryon of class @xmath16 , the normalized quark wave functions @xmath112 are given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the quark spinor and @xmath115 @xmath116\\ ; \\frac { j_0 ^ 2 ( x_{q b } ) } { x_{q b}^2}\\ ] ] @xmath117}^{1/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath118^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath119 is solution of the equation @xmath120 which arises from the boundary condition at the surface of the bag .",
    "+ in this model the ground state bag energy is identified with the baryon mass @xmath121 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number of quarks of flavor @xmath124 inside the bag , @xmath125 is the bag constant and @xmath126 the zero - point motion parameter , fixed to reproduce the baryon spectrum at zero density . +    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have introduced finite size volume correlations to extend the study of matter properties at densities much higher than that of symmetric nuclear matter at the saturation point .",
    "this has been performed through a van der waals approach to describe hypermatter at zero temperature .",
    "one of the advantages of the present approach consists in that we can continue to use the relativistic effective lagrangians appropriate for low baryonic density , because the excluded volume corrections appear within the normalization of the baryon fields .",
    "+ we have choosen two effective models to compare the effects of finite volume correlations with respect to the more usual point - like descriptions , these are the zm and the qmc models . first we have enlarged the range of applicability of van der waals volume correction to higher densities by introducing a model ( qmc ) that avoids causality violation @xcite- @xcite , since the hard core has been replaced with a compressible bag structure .",
    "second , although the qmc model deals with finite volume bags , this property is usually lost in the calculation of thermodynamical properties .",
    "this feature has been partially corrected in the results qmc - vc of this work .",
    "+ near the normal saturation density finite volume effects prove to be small for both the zm and the qmc models . at higher densities",
    "these repulsive short range effects show up in a model dependent way . for the zm model with rigid hadrons ,",
    "the pressure and the energy raise steeper than for the point - like prediction as the density gets closer to the touching limit .",
    "this favours the production of @xmath2 hyperons in our example .",
    "+ for the qmc model we have obtained that the contribution of finite effects depends significantly on the bag equilibrium condition used , as explained in the text . using the standard condition the bags",
    "are not seriously compressed with density and volume corrections can be appreciable in the eos but not in the change of relative particle occupation .",
    "+ on the other side , if the bags must equilibrate the external baryonic pressure , a seemingly more physical condition , their respective radius suffer a faster reduction when the density increases . therefore assuming the validity of this approach , short range correlations could be neglected in the eos up to much higher densities , provided the compression effects are included in the baryonic effective mass as the qmc model does .",
    "in fact those physical aspects related to the size of the hadrons itself will be seriously affected by the choise of the equilibrium conditions . +",
    "a general conclusion is that finite volume corrections are less significative in the eos when the medium density influence on the hadron structure is properly taken into account inside the model prescriptions .",
    "the production of hyperons is sensibly affected by excluded volume correlations , decreasing its density threshold and enhancing its relative population as density increases .",
    "this studies on finite baryonic size effects on hyperon matter properties aim to describe more properly the possible composition and structure of neutron stars .",
    "however a more complete treatment must include the full baryon octet .",
    "in order to deduce the equilibrium condition proposed for case @xmath127 we consider only @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons . the inclusion of other mesons is straigthforward .",
    "the qmc lagrangian density with quark fields @xmath128 coupled to scalar @xmath129 and vector @xmath130 neutral mesons , is written as follows @xmath131 here @xmath132 is the radial step function which schematically confine the quarks inside the spherical bag .",

    "( [ eqscal ] ) and ( [ eqvec ] ) respectively , therefore it becomes          where @xmath148 is the pressure exerted by the quarks on the bag surface .",
    "the standard qmc equilibrium condition can be derived by requiring to be zero the first term of eq.([equil ] ) .",
    "particularly , for the qmc model the second term of this equation is strictly zero , which is due to the fact that in the qmc lagrangian there is a static bag surrounded by free mesons .",
    "as the baryon density increases this picture is not adequate , since at high densities the mesons are far from the free field approximation .",
    "although mesons are in the whole space , i.e. outside as well as inside the bags , the @xmath142 in eq.([equil ] ) is coming from a cancellation of identical terms as it has been shown .",
    "the fact that mesons are also inside the bag is reflected on the baryon density dependence of @xmath104 , @xmath149 , @xmath58 , the quark wave functions , etc .",
    "on the other hand , from the effective lagrangian [ lagral ] we have @xmath150 , where @xmath151 comes from the free meson sector and @xmath152 is the contribution from baryons coupled to mesons .",
    "energy - momentum conservation implies @xmath153 .",
    "explicit evaluation shows that @xmath154 .",

    "<S> we study the effects of the finite size of the baryons on the equation of state of homogeneous hadronic matter with hyperons . </S>",
    "<S> the finite extension of hadrons is introduced in order to improve the perfomance of field theoretical models at very high densities , simulating the short - range hard - core repulsive part of the baryon - baryon potential . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the quark meson coupling model to describe the baryon dynamics because this model provides a density dependent radius of the bag . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we calculate finite size corrections for the zimanyi - moszkowski model in order to make a definite comparison . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> finite size effects are implemented through a van der waals like correction in the normalization of the baryon fields . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> we investigate @xmath0-stable matter in conditions that could be found in the interior of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the excluded volume corrections contribute significantly for densities above twice the symmetric nuclear matter saturation density , although for the quark model the results strongly depends upon the equilibrium conditions for the confinement volume immersed in a dense medium . + </S>",
