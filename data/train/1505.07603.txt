    "the variable hard x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei is generally considered to originate in a compact region known as the corona which lies above the accretion disc ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inner accretion disc produces copious uv emission in a quasi - blackbody spectral shape which is compton upscattered by hot coronal electrons energised by magnetic fields from the disc .",
    "rapid variability of the 210  kev x - ray emission seen from many agn indicates that the corona is physically small .",
    "recent x - ray spectral - timing and reverberation analyses of agn spectra strongly support this conclusion and in many cases require the corona to lie just @xmath1 above the central black hole @xcite .",
    "variability analyses of microlensed components of several lensed quasars also indicate small hard x - ray emission regions , with half - light radii less than @xmath2 .",
    "together , the evidence points to the corona being compact @xcite .",
    "further evidence of a small physical size of the corona emerges from observations of the emissivity profile of the broad iron line @xcite and from varying obscuration of the corona by clouds @xcite .",
    "sources which are physically small and highly luminous can also be compact in a radiative sense , meaning that interactions involving significant energy exchange between photons and particles are commonplace in the source .",
    "the relevant parameter here is then the ratio of source luminosity to size , usually given in terms of the dimensionless compactness parameter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gfr ) : @xmath3 @xmath4 is the luminosity , @xmath5 the radius of the source ( assumed spherical ) , @xmath6 the thomson cross section and @xmath7 the mass of the electron .",
    "when @xmath8 a particle loses a significant fraction of its energy on crossing the source region ( see section 2 ) .",
    "an idea of the magnitude of @xmath9 can be seen by replacing @xmath5 by @xmath10 , the gravitational radius ( @xmath11 ) , and comparing the luminosity @xmath4 with the eddington limit @xmath12 , @xmath13 thus sources operating with coronal emission exceeding 1 per cent of the eddington limit with coronae which are less than @xmath14 in size are compact in the sense that @xmath15 .",
    "if the photons are energetic enough , photon - photon collisions can lead to pair production which can play a major role in determining the outgoing spectrum and overall composition of the corona @xcite .",
    "consider a small region of size @xmath5 containing soft photons and unit thomson depth of electrons ( i.e. @xmath16 ) into which an increasing amount of power is fed into the electrons . as the electron temperature @xmath17 rises , compton scattering of the soft photons produces a power - law radiation spectrum extending to a wien tail at energies around @xmath18 .",
    "photon - photon collisions create electron - positron pairs when the product of the photon energies , in units of @xmath19 , exceeds 2 .",
    "thus pairs appear when the tail extends above @xmath20 ( i.e. 1 mev ) .",
    "the pair density is proportional to the luminosity and temperature and inversely proportional to the source size .",
    "the energy associated with increased luminosity goes into increased numbers of pairs rather than temperature .",
    "pair production can become a runaway process , outstripping annihilation , soaking up energy and limiting any rise in temperature .",
    "when the source is radiatively compact this happens at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "photon - photon collisions involving hard x - rays can thus produce electron - positron pairs which act as an @xmath9-dependent thermostat @xcite .",
    "this limits the source temperature @xmath23 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the only other major factor here is the source geometry and its location with respect to the soft photon source .",
    "it has been suspected for over 30 years that luminous agn and black hole binary ( bhb ) sources such as cygnus x-1 are radiatively compact .",
    "@xcite tabulate compactness parameters of several dozen agn based on their observed x - ray luminosity and an estimate / limit of source size , obtained from rapid variability .",
    "they found many sources with @xmath24 .",
    "however , robust estimates of the coronal temperature and in particular the size of the corona have however been lacking . now , however , with spectral timing results combined with temperature estimates becoming available from _ nustar _ , robust values of both @xmath9 and @xmath25 can be obtained , after carefully accounting for disc reflection in the spectrum .",
    "_ nustar _ is the first telescope for cosmic x - ray sources with focussing optics operating in hard x - rays up to 78  kev .",
    "this means that it yields high signal - to - noise spectra over the band where the corona emits most of its power .    in this paper",
    "we gather results from _ nustar _ and from the coded mask instruments integral and _",
    "swift_-bat on agn and bhb to map out their locations on the @xmath26 diagram .",
    "high power levels fed into a compact corona should produce a spectrum ( e.g. photon index and high energy turnover ) constrained by source size , luminosity and geometry .",
    "observations of source size and luminosity can in principle therefore enable us to establish the geometry of the corona and reveal the heating and thermalization mechanisms operating .",
    "note that we only consider coronae where emission is generated , not the large scattering corona in the low - mass x - ray binaries known as accretion disc corona sources ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "we begin by gathering together various theoretical constraints from gfr , @xcite , and @xcite within the temperature  compactness , @xmath27 , plane .",
    "the estimates are initially deduced for non - relativistic temperatures , but the coupling times are extended into the transrelativistic regime using the work of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ghf ) .",
    "consider a spherical source of size @xmath5 and scattering optical depth @xmath28 in which luminosity @xmath4 is generated .",
    "the energy density in photons is then @xmath29 and thus the compton cooling time of an electron is @xmath30 expressed in terms of the light crossing time of the source , @xmath31 , @xmath32 if @xmath33 then we have @xmath34 this justifies the statement made in the introduction that , when @xmath9 exceeds unity , an electron loses much of its energy on crossing the source",
    ".    the dominant radiation process will be the one with the shortest cooling time .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cooling time of an electron in a gas of density @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fine - structure constant , which we compare with @xmath38 , to give @xmath39 and an upper limit to bremsstrahlung dominance when @xmath40 this demonstrates that comptonization dominates at high compactness .",
    "two - body collisions are the simplest heating and thermalization mechanism , with electron - proton coupling occurring faster than electron cooling when @xmath41 the relevant relation for electron - electron coupling is @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "both of these relations are non - relativistic and apply only at low electron temperatures ( @xmath43 ) : in fig .  1 , we plot the electron - proton and electron - electron coupling lines from ghf , which have been calculated through the transrelativistic regime .",
    "pair production at high @xmath9 values is dominated by photon - photon collisions .",
    "an estimation of the pair density requires a detailed calculation covering pair production and annihilation and also the thermal balance . above a certain level , which we call the pair line , pair production runs away , as described in the introduction .",
    "@xcite estimated that , for an isolated cloud , the pair balance line occurs where @xmath44    the position of the pair line depends on the geometry of the region and the origin and level of the dominant soft photon field . @xcite computed the pair balance curve for a slab corona above a reflecting disc and obtained the line included in fig .",
    "1 . they also computed the constraints for a hemispherical corona on a slab and a sphere at a height equal to half the radius of the sphere ( see * ? ? ? * ) .     plane as decribed in detail section 2 , included are the boundaries for electron - electron coupling , electron - proton coupling , the dominance of compton cooling and pair lines for different assumptions . ]     distribution for _ nustar _ observed agn ( blue points ) and bhb ( red points ) .",
    "e coupling line from ghf is included .",
    "pair lines from stern et al ( 1995 ) are shown .",
    "the slab line has been extrapolated slightly to higher @xmath9 . ]",
    "in the last section we have seen what physical processes govern the placement of observations in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "this section concerns the collection and analysis of the data used to populate the observational @xmath0 plane presented in this paper .      to construct our observational @xmath0 plane , the coronal temperature ( @xmath45 ) is estimated throughout this work from the high energy cut - off ( @xmath46 ) . to convert from the cut - off energy to the coronal temperature a factor of 2",
    "is used ( @xmath47 ) . as discussed in @xcite",
    "a conversion factor of 2 is appropriate for optical depths smaller than one ; if the optical depth is much larger than one , the factor is closer to 3",
    ". we account for the uncertainty of the conversion in the errors on @xmath25 in addition to the statistical uncertainty . for determining luminosities ,",
    "the flux of the power - law component in the 0.1200 kev band is estimated and converted using a value of 68km / s / mpc is used for the hubble constant .",
    "the data we will consider is divided into two categories ; the first is where the information on the high energy cut - off is from a _ nustar _ observation ( cat 1 ) and the second is where the information on the high - energy cut - off is from the bat instrument onboard _ swift _ ( cat 2 ) .",
    "finally , we include results obtained from microlensed quasars observed with _",
    "chandra _ in the second category .    in our cat 1",
    "sample we include all those sources which have work which is published or in preparation that provide a constraint on the high - energy cut - off from _",
    "nustar _ , even if it is only a lower limit .",
    "the so - selected cat 1 targets are shown , together with the measurements of our observables , in tables [ data_nustar ] , and [ data_binaries ] for agn and bhb , respectively .",
    "( most of the bhb are in the hard state . ) as _ nustar _ provides spectra with the best signal - to - noise in the hard x - ray band and modelling usually includes detailed fitting of any reflection components , we expect _",
    "nustar _ spectra to provide the most robust results .",
    "the values for the high energy cut - offs of the cat 1 sample stem from the individual works quoted in the right - most column of the tables .",
    "if more than one epoch of observations exists we select the one with the best constraint on the cut - off .",
    "the estimates on the coronal size originate from modeling of the reflection spectrum and x - ray reverberation measurements ( unless the source is lensed ) .",
    "if no measurement exists we assume a value of @xmath48 which is a conservative assumption given the measurements .",
    "for the black hole masses required to derive the actual size of the coronal region , we use optical broad line reverberation measurements where they are available .",
    "if the mass estimate in the literature does not have an error estimate we assume a conservative uncertainty of a factor 10 for agn . for galactic black hole binaries",
    "we assume a black hole mass of @xmath49 if no mass estimate exists . for sources observed with _",
    "nustar _ , we estimate the coronal luminosities from the coronal fluxes of the best fit spectral models presented in the individual works .",
    "to do this we use a cut - off power law with their best fit @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and power law normalization , if given .",
    "if no power law normalization is given we determine it from the flux measurement of the most power law dominated band , given in the paper .",
    "the coronal flux is then determined in the energy range 0.1 - 200kev , as below this band the spectrum could deviate significantly from a power law and most sources already roll - over below 200kev . in case of the x - ray binaries we then use the distance to get the luminosity and for agns we use the redshifts , which are drawn from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "our cat 2 sample is assembled from three works ; an analysis of xmm / integral / bat type 1 agn observations by @xcite , an analysis of xmm / bat agn observations in the northern galactic cap by @xcite and a microlensing sample presented in @xcite . in the first case",
    "the bat spectra are those of the 70 month catalogue , and in the second case those of the 58 month catalogue .",
    "we select from the first two samples , subsamples of sources with mass estimates and constraints on the high energy cut - off .",
    "for the microlensing sample we use sources where an estimate of the coronal size exists .",
    "the selected sources and measurements are listed in tables [ data_integral ] , [ data_ranjan ] , and [ data_sample_lenses ] .",
    "the assumptions made for the coronal temperatures , coronal size and black hole mass are the same as for the cat 1 sample .",
    "the coronal fluxes for the @xcite sources are also determined in a similar fashion to what was described above . for the @xcite sample",
    "the same method can not be applied as no flux values are given in the paper , instead we use the best fit bat cross - calibration constant .",
    "we downloaded the 70 month bat spectra of the sources and set up a spectral model consisting of a cut - off power law multiplied by the cross calibration constant .",
    "the photon index , high energy cut - off and cross calibration constant are kept fixed at their best fit values , while we fit for the normalization . once the best fit normalization is found we delete the constant and estimate the coronal flux in the 0.1 - 200kev just as before .",
    "again , the redshifts from ned are used to obtain the coronal luminosity .",
    "the microlensed sample is treated differently as the measurement of the physical size of the x - ray emitting region is already non - dimensionless and can be used to calculate @xmath9 directly , the black hole mass is therefore not required .",
    "we assume further the highest energy bin in the _ chandra _ spectra shown in @xcite is a lower limit on the high - energy cut - off .",
    "this is them corrected for redshift . finally , for the coronal luminosities of the lensed quasars we use the 0.2 - 50kev luminosities reported in the @xcite paper .",
    "these objects serve to show that distant quasars operate at values of @xmath9 within the range 10100 or greater ; nustar observations will be required to measure their expected cutoffs and thus @xmath25 values .",
    "the results for the _ nustar _ sample ( cat1 ) are plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "although some of the results are lower limits , about one half are measurements of clear turnovers seen in the _ nustar _ band",
    ". a few examples of agn with clear turnovers are mcg-5 - 23 - 16 and swift  j2127.4 + 5654 , while examples of bhb are grs  1915 + 105 , grs  1739 - 278 and cyg x-1 .",
    "the largest cutoff energy is inferred in the agn ngc5506 , which is at low @xmath9 .",
    "several factors can affect the measurement of coronal temperature .",
    "the first is observational and due to the common useage of an exponential cutoff as a model for the upper spectral turnover produced by comptonization .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this produces a slower break than comptonization , which retains a straight power - law shape to higher energies before more abruptly turning down .",
    "we have simulated this by generating comptonization spectra using compps @xcite in a spherical geometry for a seed photon tenperature of 10ev , a thomson depth @xmath52 and a set of temperatures ( 40kev , 60kev , 70kev , 80kev , 90kev , 100kev , 120kev , 150kev , 200kev ) ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "these have been fitted with a powerlaw in the 0.510  kev band and the power law was later modified at higher energies using an exponential turnover assumed to represent the effect of a turnover at @xmath53 .",
    "the plot demonstrates that when the temperature is significantly above the _ nustar _ band ( i.e. @xmath54 ) and no significant deviation is yet seen in the _ nustar _ spectrum , then it is possible that the cutoff energy and thus temperature are overestimated .",
    "these affects have been carefully considered by @xcite in their study of the _ nustar _ data on ngc5506 .",
    "the exponential cutoff energy is measured at @xmath55 whereas the compps model @xcite gives a temperature of 270  kev .",
    "@xcite also remind us of the comment by @xcite that the mean value of @xmath51 for agn must lie below 300  kev , in order not to saturate the x - ray background at 100  kev .",
    "objects such as ngc5506 must be exceptional rather than the norm .",
    "the results including the cat2 sample are plotted in fig .",
    "4 . as mentioned",
    "already these generally encompass cruder spectral modelling than used for the _ nustar _ data , and the total exposures were each accumulated over several years .",
    "the sources generally concentrate around similar values to those measured with _ nustar _ , although there are a few outliers at high temperature .",
    "the most extreme one with @xmath56 is ngc4388 , a seyfert 2 galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "the measurement is with the swift - bat , the upper energy of which is 200  kev so could be suffering from the effect shown in fig .   4 .",
    "objects where there are two pairs of @xmath0 values are plotted in fig .",
    "5 .     and",
    "@xmath25 from different instruments .",
    "the two red points are the two states of cyg x-1 . ]",
    "the distribution of high energy cutoff values from the various samples is shown in fig .",
    "6 . to make use of all measurements including lower limits",
    ", we calculate the histograms and errors using monte - carlo simulations . for each realization of the histogram we draw for each cutoff constraint a cutoff value within its error range ( for the lower limits , 1000  kev",
    "is assumed to be the upper limit . )",
    "the histograms show clear peaks in the range of 100150  kev .",
    "estimates : from top to bottom , nustar sample ( see text ) , integral malizia et al ( 2014 ) , swift - bat ( vasudeven et al ( 2013 ) , all . ]",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "2 ) that the x - ray coronae measured by _ nustar _",
    "have @xmath9 ranging from 1 to 1000 with most lying between 10 and 100 , and @xmath25 ranging from 0.03 to 0.8 , with most between 0.07 and 0.3 .",
    "this places many sources against the pair runaway line for slab geometry .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties in spectral modelling and size estimates it is plausible that many of the sources track close to that line .",
    "the clustering of sources in the @xmath0 plane argues for a general physical reason , such as the pair line , attracting or constraining them to that region .",
    "many of the coronae lie in the region where general relativistic effects such as gravitational redshift and light - bending are important . to see one change produced by the first effect",
    ", the temperatures have been corrected for gravitational redshift @xmath57 in fig .",
    "the points now lie closer to the pair line for a slab but several still lie at a significantly lower value of @xmath25 .",
    "gr will also affect our estimates of @xmath9 through the effects on @xmath4 ( @xmath58 from liouville s theorem ) and @xmath5 ( which depends on the method by which this has been inferred ) .",
    "light bending , in which the strong gravity bends radiation from the corona down towards the disc , requires another correction which is inclination dependent .",
    "the net effect is to boost the intrinsic values of @xmath9 by factors of around 210 above the observed estimates .",
    "as there is more uncertainty in these corrections we merely note that the estimates of @xmath9 should be seen as lower limits .",
    "the coronal emission is likely anisotropic when the corona is close to the centre of the disc with factors such as spin and inclination affecting appearance . @xcite",
    "have used the emissivity profile of the iron line in several agn to deduce the coronal illumination of the disc and thus indirectly constrain the size of the corona . in several cases the bulk of the coronal emission is tightly limited to a compact region above the centre of the disc , with radius @xmath59 less than the height of the corona @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 , but with some emission originating from larger radii at the same height .",
    "the geometrical considerations in the stern et al ( 1995 ) models mainly affect the ratio of soft photon to electron heating powers in the corona .",
    "the effects of light bending on the incidence of soft blackbody disc emission on the corona and the twisting of magnetic fields from the disc can modify the relevance of those geometries to the strong gravity regime above the centre of the accretion disc .",
    "as seen from the corona , the disc will appear to cover most of the sky , possibly intensifying the effects of compton cooling and moving the pair line to lower @xmath25 .",
    "distribution corrected for gravitational redshift . ]",
    "another possible reason for the offset in @xmath25 values from the pair line is our assumption that the corona is homogeneous and single temperature . instead",
    ", the corona may be very dynamic with heating localised and highly intermittent in space and time .",
    "this could produce a range of temperatures in the corona , all limited by the pair threshold , but with the mean at a lower value due to compton cooling .",
    "since pairs are produced by the high energy tail of the particle and photon energy distributions , then only a small disperson in temperatures can have a large effect .",
    "this would imply that deeper observations should reveal a high energy tail to the spectra above that expected from single temperature comptonization .",
    "a variant of this possibility occurs if the protons in the corona are much hotter and the source of some of the electron heating , then proton - electron coupling may create a high energy tail which produces pairs at a lower `` temperature '' than expected for a strict maxwellian distribution .",
    "more generally , such effects will apply to sources above the electron - electron coupling line .",
    "indeed , the parts of the corona of where heating is most intense may exceed this constraint .",
    "the electron distribution may not then be maxwellian .",
    "this need not greatly affect the comptonized spectrum , which will resemble that from a thermal electron population with the same mean value of @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the electron lorentz factor ( ghf ; see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many sources are ( marginally ) above the electron ",
    "electron coupling line and all are above the electron ",
    "proton line .",
    "this emphasizes the long standing problems of the heating and thermalization process",
    "all sources have a cooling time less than the light crossing time so the energy must be present there in some other form . since protons can not supply the energy to the electrons fast enough , due to the long coupling time ( fig .",
    "1 ) we presume that it must be in terms of magnetic field . as indicated many times before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the corona must be magnetically dominated .",
    "an underlying strong magnetic field means that the synchrotron boiler dominates the energy exchange between low - energy electrons and the photon field @xcite .",
    "taking these issues further is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that all the sources that we have examined are above the eddington limit for pairs .",
    "we have assumed in all cases that the source is static .",
    "magnetic fields are presumably responsible for holding the bulk of the source together , although that does not exclude a pair wind escaping from part of the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or being accelerated into a jet @xcite . the pair limit may be avoided if the emission region is part of a relativistic outflow , such as a gamma - ray burst ( e.g. piran 2004 ) .",
    "note that no distinct annihilation line should be observable from a thermal pair plasma @xcite .",
    "the modelling by @xcite and others indicates that the thomson depth of the scattering region should be less than unity .",
    "most of the coronal particles can be pairs .",
    "pair balance together with the geometry dictate the expected epectral shape of the coronal continuum .",
    "the observed photon index @xmath50 is plotted against @xmath9 in fig .  8 .",
    "there is some agreement with the @xcite model predictions in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "we also include a line from the work of @xcite who find an observational correlation ( with much scatter ) between eddington fraction , @xmath65 , and photon index @xmath50 . for a given coronal size @xmath5",
    ", this relates to @xmath9 through equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the position of this line in the y - axis thus depends on @xmath5 .",
    "we stress that the pair limit to the temperature of luminous , static , compact regions can not be avoided .",
