    "early - type galaxies represent one of the biggest challenges to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , in particular as far as their star - formation history is concerned .",
    "studies of the nearby galaxy population can provide useful clues to solve this problem , by setting tight constraints on the level of their most recent star - formation activity .",
    "traditionally , early - type galaxies used to be regarded as simple and old stellar systems mostly devoid of gas or dust . by the turn of the century , however , evidence was already mounting that a substantial fraction elliptical and lenticular galaxies do show conspicuous gas and dust reservoirs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the presence of younger stellar components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the last years tremendous progress has been made in uncovering the recent star - formation history of early - type galaxies , owing in particular to the advent of new technologies such as integral - field spectroscopic units or more sensitive receivers of radio and mm frequencies , the launch of space observatories such as _ galex _  and _ spitzer _  allowing to probe wavelength domains otherwise inaccessible from the ground , and to large spectroscopic campaigns such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . in this paper",
    "we attempt to review such recent efforts , without any pretence of completeness .",
    "we will first focus on detailed studies of the stellar populations of early - type galaxies at different wavelengths , in particular with the ` sauron `  integral - field unit in the optical and with the _ galex _  and _ spitzer _  in the uv and mid - ir domain (  [ sec : stars ] ) .",
    "we will then turn to the reservoirs of neutral , molecular and ionised gas in nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies , and consider evidence for on - going star formation in them (  [ sec : gas ] ) .",
    "finally we will consider some results based on the analysis of large sample of early - type galaxies with sdss data (  [ sec : largervolumes ] ) , and conclude by discussing how all these findings could connect with each other (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "many studies have shown that early - type galaxies are not exclusively formed by old stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the ` sauron `  survey of early - type galaxies @xcite has further allowed to find the location of different stellar sub - populations , in particular of young stars , and to link such structures to the photometry and kinematics of early - type galaxies . using maps for the strength of the h@xmath0 , mg@xmath1 and fe5015 absorption lines in a representative sample of 48 early - type galaxies in kuntschner et al .",
    "( in preparation ) we reinforce previous indications that the integrated stellar populations of most elliptical galaxies display old stellar ages whereas lenticulars exhibit a wider spread of ages , and likewise for galaxies in clusters compared to objects in a lower density environment .",
    "very young stars , less than @xmath2-gyr - old , are found to dominate the entire ` sauron `  field - of - view of view in 4 objects in the ` sauron`sample , whereas in the remaining galaxies the young populations appear to be either distributed in extended disks or to cluster towards the centre .",
    "in fact , such young nuclear populations are also likely to have formed in small stellar disks , since the presence of young stars in the centre correlates very well with that of small ( less than @xmath3 500pc ) stellar components that are kinematically distinct from the rest of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the connection between stellar ages and kinematics extends also beyond the central regions . in @xcite",
    "we assess the overall level of rotational support in a galaxy adopting a quantity , @xmath4 , that is closely related to the specific angular momentum of a galaxy . in the ` sauron `  sample , galaxies with @xmath5 form a distinct class characterised by little or no global rotation and the presence of kpc - scale kinematically decoupled cores .",
    "opposed to such slowly rotating objects are galaxies that either display faster global rotation or that are consistent with being systems supported by rotation that are viewed at small inclinations ( see also the contribution by falcn - barroso for an illustration of these two kinds of objects ) .",
    "all ` sauron `  galaxies that formed stars recently ( which amount to 25% of the sample and include either objects with luminosity - weighted mean ages below 6.5 gyr or with young disk and nuclei ) , are fast rotators , whereas slow rotators do not show evidence of secondary star - formation events .",
    "in fact , beside the presence of young disks and nuclei , fast rotators can also display extended , mg@xmath1-enhanced structures that appear to be flatter than the stellar isophotes @xcite .",
    "although not obviously younger than the rest of the galaxy , such stellar sub - components most likely originated in a secondary star - formation event , consistent with the finding that fast rotators host dynamically distinct stellar components characterised by large angular momentum and radial anisotropy , as observed in stellar disks @xcite .",
    "although the strength of optical absorption lines such as those probed by ` sauron `  can provide sensible constraints on the presence of younger stars when compared to the predictions of _ single _ stellar population models , deriving the mass and age of young stellar components from line - strength indices alone is an exercise that is freighted with degeneracies . in this respect probing the uv light",
    "allows to weight and date even a relatively small fraction of very young stars , since the uv output of a stellar population varies dramatically over the first few 100 myr of its history .",
    "in particular , whereas the far - uv ( between 13501750 ) light is also sensitive to the radiation from old hot helium - burning horizontal branch stars , the near - uv radiation ( nuv , between 17502750 ) traces particularly well the presence of young stars .    the potential of such uv information to constrain the age and fraction of young stars of early - type galaxies has been recently shown by @xcite , who combined uv observations from _ galex _  with ground - based optical imaging for the e4 galaxy ngc  2974 .",
    "they find blue nuv - optical colour indicative of the presence of very young stars , less than 500-myr - old , both near the centre and in an outer ring .",
    "the star - formation rate and mass fraction of young stars peaks in the outer ring , reaching @xmath6 and 0.1% respectively , whereas overall 1% of the stars in ngc2974 formed in the last 500 myr . using the mass model of @xcite , @xcite also show that the location of the outer uv ring , as well as the central rings traced by the [ o@xmath7iii]@xmath8 emission in the ` sauron`data for this galaxy , is consistent with the position of orbital resonances that would be induced by the presence of a rotating large - scale bar , which is driving the observed star formation in these regions . as most of the early - type galaxies in the ` sauron `  sample are being observed with _",
    ", it will be interesting to see how many more objects will exhibit evidence of recent star formation in the uv light , as in the case of ngc  2974 .",
    "at the opposite end of the optical spectrum , mid - ir ( mir ) observations provide an alternative way to investigate the stellar populations of early - type galaxies .",
    "the mir spectra of passively evolving stellar populations are affected by the presence of mass - losing giant stars , in particular agb stars .",
    "the dusty envelopes of these stars reradiate the heat received from their parent stars in a characteristic broad region between 9 and 12 @xmath9 m , mostly due to silicate grains . as a stellar population ages",
    ", the photospheric mir continuum fades less quickly than the circumstellar 10 @xmath9 m emission , so that the relative strength of the silicate features can be used to trace the age of the population .",
    "the advent of _ spitzer _  has recently allowed to routinely detect the 10 @xmath9 m circumstellar emission in early - type galaxies , leading for instance @xcite to confirm that 82% of their virgo cluster galaxies have been passively evolving since their formation .",
    "@xcite even finds that early - type galaxies generally show old mir - inferred ages even when optical analysis based on absorption line strengths indicates relatively young luminosity - weighted mean ages .",
    "although these results seem at odds with the larger fraction of ` sauron `  galaxies with evidence of recent star formation , we need to keep in mind that both these mir studies concentrated only on the brightest end of the local early - type galaxy population , and that the mir age estimates are still subject to a severe age - metallicity degeneracy @xcite .",
    "if stellar population studies provides evidence of recent star formation in nearby early - type galaxies , we also ought to find gas reservoirs capable of fuelling such activity before and while star formation occurs .",
    "furthermore , the detection of molecular gas and of emission from h@xmath7ii - regions should correspond to the presence of the youngest of stars .",
    "a number of shallow h@xmath7i  surveys have shown already that early - type galaxies can have massive ( up to @xmath10 ) and very extended ( up to 200 kpc in size ) disks of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such investigations could only detect the most h@xmath7i - rich galaxies , however , which prompted @xcite to set out to explore the complete h@xmath7i - mass distribution of early - type galaxies , starting from the representative ` sauron`sample .",
    "so far , neutral gas has been found in 70% of the 12 _ field _ galaxies initially observed by @xcite , with masses between few times @xmath11 and just over @xmath12 .",
    "the neutral material in these objects seems also connected to the ionised gas observed by ` sauron `  in the optical regions , since all galaxies where h@xmath7i  is detected also contain ionised gas , whereas no h@xmath7i  is found in galaxies without ionised gas .",
    "additionally , in the most gas - rich systems the neutral and ionised material display a similar kinematics .",
    "considering that the presence of ionised - gas may not always lead to star formation ( see  [ subsec : ionised_gas ] ) , these early results suggest that sufficient material to explain the observed amount of recent star formation could be generally present around early - type galaxies , and that gas accretion does not happen exclusively in peculiar early - type galaxies .      in order to form",
    "stars gas ultimately has to cool and condense , leading also to the formation around dust grains of molecules such as carbon monoxide .",
    "similarly to the case of h@xmath7i , a number of co emission surveys ( see , e.g. , the compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that early - type galaxies can show substantial amounts of co emission , which generally traces regularly rotating molecular disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite have followed up with single - dish observations 43 out of the 48 early - type galaxies in the ` sauron`sample , detecting co emission in 28% of them .",
    "this fraction is somewhat smaller than previously reported , but this is because @xcite , contrary to earlier studies , surveyed also bright early - type galaxies that have a relatively lower molecular gas content .",
    "all galaxies with co emission show evidence of recent star formation in their central regions from ` sauron `  or ` oasis `  data , and have radio continuum to far - ir ( fir ) flux ratios that further supports the case for on - going star formation .",
    "in fact , the co - rich ` sauron `  early - type galaxies appear to extend the well - known relation between the star - formation rate ( sfr ) surface density and the surface density of @xmath13 by two orders of magnitude down in sfr .",
    "in addition to mm - observations , the mir domain provides additional ways to trace even tiny amount of star - formation activity , in particular through the detection of emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although most investigations with _ spitzer _  have focussed on the brightest end of the early - type population , the first results are nonetheless promising .",
    "for instance , @xcite finds evidence of recent star formation in 12% of their virgo cluster sample , whereas @xcite succeed in quantifing the epoch ( @xmath14 myrs ago ) and intensity ( adding in average @xmath15 ) of the recent star - formation event in the central regions of the sb0 ngc  4435 , adding just about 1.5% of the stellar mass in these regions .",
    "optical nebular emission has traditionally been used to trace the warm ( @xmath16k ) component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and identify star formation in h@xmath7ii  regions .",
    "ionised - gas emission in early - type galaxies is generally quite weak , however , so that its detection requires a careful subtraction of the stellar continuum .    by introducing a novel technique to address this issue ,",
    "in @xcite we could reach down to a detection limit of just 0.1for the equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission lines and detect extended ionised - gas emission in 75% of the early - type galaxies in the ` sauron `  representative sample , confirming that these systems contain gas more often than not .",
    "although the limited ` sauron `  wavelength range does not allow an extensive line - diagnostic analysis , very low [ o@xmath7iii]/h@xmath0  line ratios nonetheless suggest on - going star formation in at least 4 objects , or 8% of the sample .",
    "in fact , that stars are forming in these galaxies is proven also by the finding of disk - like gas kinematics , regular dust morphology , young stellar populations and molecular gas in all of them .",
    "interestingly , very young stars , co emission and even pah features ( shapiro , private communication ) can be found in objects where the warm gas displays very high [ o@xmath7iii]/h@xmath0  ratios ( see , e.g. , ngc3489 and ngc3156 in * ? ? ?",
    "this finding suggests that as ionised gas in early - type galaxies is also subject to different sources of excitations than o - stars , it may not always be a good tracer of star - formation , in particular if this occurs at a low level . on the other hand , all the ` sauron `  early - type galaxies with compelling evidence of",
    "on - going star formation share a relaxed gas kinematics , displaying in particular small gas velocity dispersions .",
    "this common kinematic characteristic is found exclusively in fast rotators in the ` sauron `  sample , however , suggesting that not all early - type galaxies are equally likely to form stars .",
    "in particular , the spatial correlation with the hot ( @xmath17k ) x - ray emitting phase of the ism ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) suggests that the fate of ionised gas in the most massive and slowly - rotating early - type galaxies is to evaporate in the hot medium rather than to condense and form stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a quantitative analysis ) .",
    "preventing star formation in the most massive objects consistently over time through the interaction with the x - ray gas could explain the low frequency of co and pah detection in these systems (  [ subsec : molecular_gas ] ) , and is in agreement with the notion that the most massive galaxies host also the oldest stellar populations .",
    "if the previous efforts show with tremendous detail that a substantial fraction of nearby early - type galaxies is or has been recently forming stars , such local studies can only offer a sketchy picture of the recent star - formation history of early - type galaxies in the local universe .",
    "large surveys such as the sdss , on the other hand , allow to investigate of much larger number of early - type galaxies , although by generally offering only the integrated photometric and spectroscopic properties of these objects .",
    "some of the most dramatic results in this subject have been obtained by combining the sdss optical photometry with nuv images obtained with _ galex_. out of 39 bright early - type galaxies from the sample of @xcite , @xcite found 6 objects with nuv ",
    "r - band colours consistent with the formation in the last gyr of stars amounting to approximately 1 - 2% of the stellar mass .",
    "@xcite considerably extended @xcite first exercise to analyse a sample @xmath18 morphologically - selected early - type galaxies from the sdss with @xmath19 , finding that at least @xmath20 of their objects had formed between 1 to 3% of their mass in the last gyr , mostly between 300 and 500 myrs ago . in an even larger effort ,",
    "@xcite have compiled a catalogue of @xmath21 morphologically - selected early - type galaxies with redshift between @xmath22 and sdss , _ galex _  and 2mass photometric and spectroscopic data , finding not only similar fractions of galaxies with recent star formation , but also that @xmath23 of their early - type galaxies are currently forming stars based on their emission - line ratios .    the recent work of @xcite further complements these studies . @xcite and @xcite concentrated on red - sequence objects without strong emission to avoid agn contamination in the uv light , whereas @xcite include galaxies with a broader range of optical colours and with gas emission but conservatively deem as quiescent objects without reliable h@xmath24 , h@xmath0 , [ n@xmath7ii]@xmath25 and [ o@xmath7iii]emission .",
    "@xcite investigates more closely the red - sequence early - type galaxy population with gas emission , by including objects with relatively fainter gas emission as long as they display h@xmath24  and [ o@xmath7ii]@xmath26 lines that indicates liner - like emission , or alternatively , which firmly exclude on - going star formation . with such a sensitive distinction between galaxies with or without ionised - gas @xcite",
    "find that red - sequence galaxies with liner - like emission show integrated stellar populations that are invariably younger than their quiescent counterparts , except at the brightest and more massive end of the red - sequence where galaxies show no sign of recent star formation .",
    "how do all these finding combine together ?",
    "is it possible to draw a consistent picture of the recent star - formation history of local early - type galaxies based both on the detailed study of the closest galaxies and on the analysis of integrated properties for much larger samples ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is not quite yet .    starting with the fraction of early - type galaxies that are presently forming stars , at first glance",
    "the fact that 8% of the ` sauron`sample display [ o@xmath7iii]/h@xmath0  line ratios consistent with emission from h@xmath7ii  regions would seem in reasonable agreement with the finding that 4% of the objects in the sdss sample of @xcite display the same behaviour .",
    "we have to keep in mind , however , that the ` sauron `  sample is a representative , but _",
    "incomplete _ sample of the nearby early - type population , in which fainter galaxies are particularly underrepresented . as star formation could be more common in these systems than in more massive galaxies (  [ subsec : ionised_gas ] ) , the true fraction of early - type galaxies with emission associated to h@xmath7ii  regions could be much higher than presently found by ` sauron ` .",
    "similarly , also the fraction of star - forming early - type galaxies estimated from more complete sdss samples should be regarded as a lower limit , since the sdss spectra can only detect the most intense of starbursts .",
    "for instance , considering an ew of 0.8  for the faintest lines detected in the sdss data , only 1 of the 48 ` sauron `  galaxies has sufficiently strong emission within @xmath27 ( corresponding to the typical physical area subtended by the sdss fibers ) to be detected as one of the star - forming early - type galaxies of @xcite .    as regards the presence of younger stellar components in early - type galaxies , it is reassuring that @xcite and @xcite estimate fractions of galaxies that are presently forming stars ( @xmath28 ) and that contain populations younger than a few 100 myr ( @xmath29 ) , respectively , which are consistent with each other given the different timescales traced by the nebular and nuv emission .",
    "on ther other hand , it is less clear how well the mass fractions and ages of the young stellar components derived by _ galex _  and sdss data agree with the ` sauron `  observations .",
    "consider the fact that just 1% of 500-myr - old stars embedded in a 10-gyr - old populations induces an increase of @xmath30  in the strength of the h@xmath0  absorption line .",
    "only 10% of objects in the ` sauron `  sample have a global ( within @xmath27 ) h@xmath0  line - strength that exceeds by 1  what observed in the oldest objects .",
    "although the discrepancy with the 30% fraction reported by @xcite could be reconciled considering that more ` sauron`objects show evidence of recent star formation ( up tp 25% ,  [ subsec : optical_stars ] ) , until the mass and age fraction of these young subcomponents is determined for a sufficiently complete sample of nearby galaxies it will remain hard to ascertain whether such ` sauron `  objects correspond to the galaxies that experienced recent star formation according to analyses based on _ galex _  and sdss data .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "it is clear that with the exception of the most massive objects most early - type galaxies have undergone some degree of recent star formation .",
    "the gas reservoirs fuelling such activity can now be detected with relative ease , and new techniques have been developed to analyse data from different passbands to better constrain the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "the biggest challenge ahead is still to quantify more precisely the extent of such star - formation activity and its impact in shaping the observed stuctural and dynamical properties of these systems .",
    "in fact , it is precisely to address these and other questions that we have recently started a complete integral - field survey of the nearby early - type galaxy population , nicknamed atlas@xmath31 , which will be complemented by single - dish mm - band observations and by deep multi - wavelength optical imaging .",
