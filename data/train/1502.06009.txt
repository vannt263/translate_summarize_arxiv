    "indeed , woods proved @xcite that any example over the integers defined with linear inequalities , boolean operations ( and , or , not ) , and quantifiers ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) has this quasi - polynomial behavior . this is true even if there is more than one parameter ; for example , @xmath43 is a quasi - polynomial of period 2 in @xmath3 and period 3 in @xmath44 .",
