    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are complex systems hosting @xmath7 gravitationally bound stars , distributed with an approximately spherical geometry . in the central regions of these stellar systems , where stars are forced to live in an extremely dense environment , the probability of stellar encounters is highly enhanced .",
    "such collisions lead to the formation of peculiar objects like cataclysmic variables , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , millisecond pulsars and blue straggler stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and they influence the time scales on which mass segregation , core collapse and other dynamical processes occur @xcite .    the large stellar concentration in the central regions of high density gcs prohibited to resolve individual stars for many years , until the launch of hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which allowed exquisite resolution over a relatively large ( a few square arcmin ) field of view ( fov ) mainly in the optical bands .",
    "the investigation of the stellar content of gcs in the bulge of the galaxy has the additional complication of the presence of thick clouds of dust along the line of sight that almost totally absorb the optical light , and/or the presence of a heavy field star contamination .",
    "the exploration of such clusters requires near - infrared ( nir ) observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , a wavelength range where the foreground extinction significantly drops . the observations of such stellar systems in the nir have tremendously improved with the advent of instrumentation assisted by the new adaptive optics ( ao ) facilities .",
    "these systems , in fact , mainly work in the nir , where the spatial and temporal coherence of the corrugated wavefront is larger @xcite , and they are able to compensate the blurriness of the astronomical images due to the earth s atmosphere by using one or more deformable mirrors and , as reference , natural and/or laser guide stars .",
    "the gemini south telescope , on cerro pachn in chile , currently is the only facility equipped with a multi - conjugate adaptive optics system ( named gems ) , which uses three natural guide stars , a constellation of five laser guide stars and two deformable mirrors conjugated at the ground and at an altitude of 9 km ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this allows gems to ( almost ) reach the diffraction limit of the telescope . by exploiting the unprecedented capabilities of this system , which works in combination with the nir high - resolution camera gemini south adaptive optics imager ( gsaoi ) , we started an observing campaign of a set of gcs located in the galactic bulge .",
    "after the encouraging results obtained for liller 1 @xcite , a heavily obscured cluster located very close to the galactic plane and center , here we present the results for ngc 6624 .",
    "this gc is located just at the edge of the inner bulge , at a distance of 7.9 kpc from earth ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) and it is characterized by only a moderate foreground extinction for a bulge gc , @xmath8 ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "these features also make ngc 6624 an ideal target to investigate the sky performance of the gems+gsaoi system .",

    "* irac-2 mounted at the eso 2.2 m telescope mpi .",
    "the nir cmd derived from these observations was deeper than the previous one , reaching the cluster sub - giant branch ( @xmath1 @xmath3 17 ) , and thus allowing to study the rgb features ( rgb bump and tip ; see @xcite ) .",

    "( hereafter vvv ) survey .",
    "the nir cmd obtained from the vvv catalog was deep enough ( @xmath1 @xmath3 19 ) to sample the main sequence turn - off ( ms - to ) only in the external regions of the cluster @xcite .",
    "ngc 6624 is quite compact and it has been catalogued as a dynamically evolved cluster , which already experienced core collapse @xcite .",
    "it has been found to harbour six millisecond pulsars @xcite and at least an ultra - compact lmxb @xcite , thus confirming that its dense environment efficiently boosts the formation of exotic objects .",
    "in this paper we present ultra - deep nir observations of ngc 6624 obtained by using the powerful combination of the gems+gsaoi devices mounted at the gemini south telescope .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ obs ] we discuss the observations and the data analysis . in section [ cmd ]",
    "we present the cmd of the cluster .",
    "section [ age ] is focused on the determination of the age of the cluster and in section [ luminosity ] we discuss the luminosity ( lf ) and mass functions ( mf ) of the cluster ms . in section [ concl ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the data set analyzed in this work consists of a sample of high - quality @xmath0 and @xmath1 images obtained with gems and the nir camera gsaoi .",
    "gsaoi has a resolution of about 0.02/pixels and consists of four 2048 x 2048 pixels chips , divided by gaps of about 2 , providing a total fov of almost @xmath9 .",
    "ngc 6624 was observed on may 24 , 2013 as part of the proposal gs-2013-q-23 ( pi : d. geisler ) .",
    "a total of 28 images ( 14 in the @xmath0 and 14 in the @xmath1 bands ) , with an exposure time @xmath10 s each , was acquired during the run . to fully cover the gaps between the gsaoi chips",
    ", we adopted a dither pattern with a maximum offset of about @xmath11 between two consecutive images . during the observing night the dimm monitor on cerro pachn recorded excellent seeing conditions , with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath12 .",
    "an average stellar fwhm smaller than 4 pixels ( 0.08 , close to the diffraction limit of the telescope ) has been measured in all @xmath0 and @xmath1 images .",
    "unfortunately , one @xmath0-band exposure was characterized by a significantly worse fwhm , so it was excluded from the subsequent analysis . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we present a two - color mosaic of @xmath1 and @xmath0 images of ngc 6624 .",
    "figure [ zoomgems ] shows the comparison between a central region ( 10@xmath13 10 ) of ngc 6624 obtained with hst in the f435w filter ( _ left panel _ ) and with gems / gsaoi system in the @xmath1 band ( _ right panel _ ) : the spatial resolution of the ao corrected image is indeed impressive .",
    "the data analysis was performed following the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , each individual chip was analyzed independently , by using standard pre - reduction procedure , within the ` iraf ` environment , in order to correct for flat - field and bias and subtract the background .",
    "for this purpose , a master sky was obtained by combining 5 sky images per filter of a relatively empty field . in order to get accurate photometry , even in the innermost region of the cluster",
    ", we performed point - spread function ( psf ) fitting by using ` daophot ` @xcite of all the detected stellar sources . for each chip , we selected @xmath3 100 bright , isolated and unsaturated stars ( using ` find ` and ` photo ` ) , that were used to derive the best - fit psf model . based on a @xmath14 test , the best - fit psf analytic models were found to be a moffat function ( with @xmath15=1.5 ; @xcite ) for the @xmath1 images and a penny function @xcite for the @xmath0 ones .",
    "we also noted that photometry significantly improves by adopting psf models varying within the fov .",
    "in particular we adopted a linear dependence on the position within the frame in chip 1 , and a cubic one for chips 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the selected models were then applied , using the ` allstar ` and ` allframe ` tasks @xcite , to all the sources having peak counts larger than 3@xmath16 above the local background level , thus determining the instrumental magnitudes for each star candidate in each chip . in the catalog we included only stars present in at least two images for each filter .",
    "this criterion removed most of the cosmic rays and other spurious detections and allowed to fill the gaps between the different chips of gsaoi . for each star , we homogenized the magnitudes estimated in different images , and their weighted mean and standard deviation have been finally adopted as the star mean magnitude and its related photometric error ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the instrumental positions have been reported onto the absolute coordinate system by adopting the star catalog by @xcite as astrometric reference and by using the cross - correlation software ` cataxcorr ` @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the final catalog have been finally calibrated by using a sample of stars in common with the vvv catalog .",
    "the latter has been realized by using the ` daophot ` based vvv - skz pipeline @xcite and reported into the 2mass photometric and astrometric system ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopted an iterative 2@xmath16 - clipping procedure to estimate the calibration equations transforming the instrumental gems @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes into the vvv photometric system . in order to avoid bias , only the brightest stars ( with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) were used ( see figure [ calib ] ) , yielding a total of about 300 calibration stars in each filter .",
    "the r.m.s . of the calibration is @xmath3 0.02 mag both in @xmath0 and in @xmath19 .",
    "in order to obtain a clear definition of the evolutionary sequences in the cmd , we selected only very well measured stars by imposing a selection in the sharpness parameter .",
    "in particular , we divided our sample in 0.5 magnitude - wide bins and for each bin we derived the median value of the sharpness by applying an iterative 2@xmath20rejection ( an example is shown in figure [ sharp ] ) .",
    "all the stars satisfying this selection criterion and lying within 6@xmath16 from the median are shown in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath21 ) cmds plotted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "these are the deepest and highest - quality cmds in the nir ever obtained from the ground for this cluster , but quite comparable with those obtained for ngc 6121 with hawk - i@vlt ( very large telescope ; @xcite ) and for m15 with pisces@lbt ( large binocular telescope ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nir gemini cmds presented in this study are fully comparable , both in depth and resolution , to the optical ones obtained by using different instruments on board hst , such as the wfpc2 @xcite and the acs / hrc @xcite . in figure [ fig2 ] the red hb at @xmath1 @xmath3 13.3 and a well defined rgb bump at about @xmath22 are clearly distinguishable .",
    "unfortunately , the stars lying along the brightest portion of the rgb ( @xmath23 ) are saturated in all the available images .",
    "the ms - to region is well defined at @xmath24 and the ms nicely extends for more than 4 magnitudes down to @xmath25 21.5 . at odds with @xcite , we find no evidence of a broad sequence located below the cluster ms at bluer colors , which has been interpreted as a background feature , due to a tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , located behind the cluster along its line of sight .",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy is likely ascribable to the relatively small fov of gsaoi compared to that of the acs . at @xmath26 20 we clearly identify the so - called ms `` knee '' ( ms - k ) , a particular feature commonly defined as the reddest ms point in nir cmds .",
    "this feature is due to the absorption of molecular hydrogen induced by collisions @xcite and flags the portion of the ms populated by very low - mass stars ( with @xmath27 ) . until now",
    ", the ms - k has been observed only by using hst optical+nir images @xcite and a proper combination of hst and mcao data ( mad@vlt - @xcite ; pisces@lbt - @xcite and gems - @xcite ) .",
    "the detection shown in figure [ fig2 ] is the first determination of the ms - k feature in a purely nir cmd obtained from the ground .",
    "the detailed study of this feature and its use as a possible age indicator @xcite will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( s. saracino et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "in this section we take advantage of the exquisite quality of the cmds shown in figure [ fig2 ] to estimate the age of ngc 6624 by using the luminosity of the ms - to as an age indicator .      in order to derive the age of the cluster via the isochrone fitting method ,",
    "three main cluster parameters are needed , namely the metallicity , the distance and the reddening .",
    "_ metallicity - _ the most recent metallicity estimate of ngc 6624 is [ fe / h]@xmath28 .",
    "this value has been derived indirectly from the new metallicity scale of @xcite , based on optical high - resolution spectra of about 20 gcs .",
    "other estimates in the literature provide slightly lower metallicities : [ fe / h]@xmath29 ( @xcite , hereafter cg97 ; @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath32 color excess estimates in the cluster direction range from 0.25 to 0.33 @xcite with a fair agreement on @xmath32 = 0.28 ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "_ distance modulus - _ different estimates of the distance modulus of ngc 6624 have been obtained : @xmath33 = 14.49 ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) , @xmath33 = 14.40 @xcite , and @xmath33 = 14.63 @xcite .",
    "both the reddening and the distance modulus were mainly derived in a differential way , by comparing the cmd of ngc 6624 with those of other clusters having the same metallicity and known values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in order to compare theoretical models with the nir photometry of the cluster",
    ", we selected three different sets of @xmath34-enhanced isochrones :    * a bag of stellar tracks and isochrones ( ` basti ` ; @xcite ) isochrones with @xmath31=+0.4 $ ] , y = 0.259 and a mass - loss parameter @xmath35 = 0.4 @xcite . *",

    "these parameters well reproduce the main evolutionary features in the high - quality optical hst cmd by @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of adopting different values for these parameters will be discussed at the end of this section .",
    "+   + ` basti ` _ isochrones - _ figure [ basti1 ] shows a set of seven isochrones with appropriate different ages ranging from 10.5 to 13.5 gyr , stepped by 0.5 gyr , overplotted to the data of ngc 6624 in the ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath21 ) cmds , by assuming the quoted distance and reddening .",
    "the ` basti ` nir colors and magnitudes are on the johnson - cousins - glass photometric system , so they were converted first on the @xcite system and then , by using the transformations of @xcite , into the 2mass photometric system @xcite . + as can be seen , the agreement between ` basti ` models and our data is quite good in the extended ms and in the to region , while it is not completely satisfactory in terms of color at the level of the ms - k ( at @xmath41 ) . ] and in the lower part of the rgb .",
    "a mismatch between models and data appears also at the brightest portion of the rgb , at @xmath42 but in this case it is likely due to non - linearity and saturation problems that mainly affect the @xmath1 band photometry . in spite of this , both the luminosity of the rgb bump and the zahb level are well reproduced ( see figure [ basti1 ] ) .",
    "focussing on the to region , in order to identify the isochrone that best reproduces the observations , we performed a @xmath14 analysis .",
    "the @xmath14 parameter has been computed by selecting a subsample of stars in the ms - to region , in the magnitude range @xmath43 , where the isochrone shape is particularly sensitive to age variations .",

    "a color offset @xmath50 ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) was needed to reconcile these evolutionary models to the data , in agreement with what found by @xcite . ` dsed ` isochrones do a good job of reproducing the observed cmd morphology of ngc 6624 , from the sgb level down to the ms - k .",
    "the rgb instead shows the same discrepancies already seen for the ` basti ` isochrones , with the only difference that in this case , even the magnitude of the rgb bump is not well reproduced . this is likely due to the fact that different models treat overshooting from convective cores in different ways .",
    "a @xmath14 test has been performed also for ` dsed ` models and the minimum value has been obtained for an absolute age of @xmath49 gyr . this result is shown in figure [ dsedchi ] , together with a zoom into the ms - to / sgb regions of ngc 6624 .",
    "+   + ` vr ` _ isochrones - _ finally , the ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath21 ) cmds of ngc 6624 have been compared to the new ` vr ` isochrones ( @xcite ) ( see figure [ viri ] ) . according to the results of @xcite and @xcite we needed to apply a color shift of -0.008 in order to have a good match between models and data .",
    "the ms - to and the sgb level are well reproduced , as well as the shape of the ms - k . at the base of the rgb instead , ` vr ` models are systematically too red compared with the observed photometry . by performing a @xmath14 test on the ` vr ` isochrones , we obtained a slightly older absolute age of @xmath52 gyr , however in agreement , within the uncertainties of the method , with the ages derived from ` basti ` and ` dsed ` models .",
    "figures [ basti1 ] , [ dotter ] and [ viri ] show that there is a mismatch between all models and observation starting from the rgb base . as discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "this is a well known and long - standing problem .",
    "it may be related to some issues depending on the @xmath53 - color transformations in the ir , and possibly caused by uncertainties in the model atmospheres , like treatment of absorption lines as a function of gravity and to the abundance of some specific elements . + the impact of the adopted chemical composition on the overall quality of the fit has been tested .",
    "in particular , we compared isochrones with [ fe / h ] = -0.42 and [ @xmath34/fe ] = + 0.2 adopted by @xcite for their age derivation of ngc 6624 and [ fe / h ] = -0.60 & [ @xmath34/fe ] = + 0.4 that we have used for our age derivation . for a fixed age , the two isochrones",

    "we have also considered the effect of the abundance variations .",
    "@xcite showed that a modest helium enhancement of y=0.04 is not able to solve the observed disagreement between models and data at the sgb / rgb level .",
    "we verified that the overall match still remains unsatisfactory even adopting isochrones with an helium content as large as y=0.35 .",
    "in particular , while the increase of helium results in a better fit at the rgb base , it does not allow to properly reproduce the ms .",
    "finally , we tried to test the impact of adopting different values of reddening and distance on the determination of the age of the cluster . with this aim",
    "we performed the same @xmath14 analysis as before by assuming the values of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this analysis gives age values of @xmath54 gyr and @xmath55 gyr respectively .",
    "however a visual check reveals that isochrones having such extreme values of e(b - v ) and/or @xmath33 do not reproduce properly the main evolutionary sequences ( ms - to / sgb level , hb level and rgb bump ) of the cluster .",

    "as shown in figure [ age_conf ] , the value determined in this work is in good agreement , within the errors , with most of the previous estimates quoted in the literature .",
    "the largest discrepancy is found with respect to the value determined by @xcite . by comparing the cmd of ngc 6624 with those of ngc 6637 and 47 tucanae ( having a similar metallicity )",
    ", the authors established that these clusters have the same age ( @xmath56 gyr ) by using the yale isochrones . a relatively old age ( @xmath57 gyr )",

    "@xcite derived for ngc 6624 two different ages : 12 gyr from the model best reproducing the ms - to region ( as in our case ) , and a lower limit of 10.5 gyr , from the isochrone providing an acceptable fit to all the investigated age indicators . from the isochrone",
    "fitting and the zahb loci , @xcite derived the ages of 55 gcs for which the optical hst / acs photometry was publicly available . in the case of ngc 6624",

    "we have studied the lf and the mf of ms stars in ngc 6624 and their radial variations within the fov of gsaoi .",

    "the slopes of the mf and lf are expected to vary as a function of the distance from the cluster center , with indexes decreasing as distance increases , because of the different effect of mass segregation . moreover ,",
    "the radial variation in the stellar mf of star clusters allow to derive crucial information about the dynamical history of the system ( including the amount of mass loss suffered by the clusters , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and variation in the stellar initial mass function as recently shown by @xcite . in this context , ngc 6624 is a quite interesting case because it has been classified as a post - core collapse cluster @xcite , hence it has already experienced some of the most energetic and advanced phenomena known to occur during the dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems @xcite .      in order to derive a meaningful ms - lf ,",
    "it is important to take into account a number of effects ( such as blends , photometric errors and stellar crowding ) that can limit the photometric accuracy , especially when deriving complete samples of faint stars . in order to assess the impact of these effects",
    ", we performed a set of artificial star experiments following the prescriptions reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main steps of this procedure are briefly summarized below .",
    "we initially defined a mean ridge - line ( mrl ) in the ( @xmath40 ) plane by considering 0.5 mag - wide bins in @xmath1 and by selecting the corresponding median value in color after a 2@xmath20clipping rejection ( see table 1 and the red line in figure [ sim_conf ] , left panel ) .",
    "then , we generated a catalog of simulated stars with a @xmath1-input magnitude ( @xmath62 ) extracted from a lf modeled to reproduce the observed lf .",
    "to each star extracted from the lf , we finally assigned a @xmath63 magnitude by means of an interpolation along the mrl of the cluster . in order to avoid artificially increasing the crowding conditions , only one artificial star was simulated in each run within a @xmath64 pixels cell ( more than 5 times the typical fwhm of stars on the images ) .",
    "in addition , we imposed each simulated star to have a minimum distance of about 50 pixels from the edges of each chip . by imposing these criteria and adopting the coordinate transformations discussed in section [ obs ] ,",
    "artificial stars were added to the 13 @xmath0 and 14 @xmath1 images by using the ` daophot ii / addstar ` software .",
    "this procedure was performed individually on each chip and the artificial stars thus obtained were analyzed by using the same psf models and the same reduction process ( including the same selection criteria ) adopted for the real images , as fully described in section [ obs ] .",
    "a total of @xmath3 48000 artificial stars per chip have been simulated .",
    "figure [ sim_conf ] shows a comparison between the simulated ( _ left panel _ ) and the observed cmd ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "it is quite evident that the two cmds are fully compatible over the entire magnitude range covered by the observations , in particular the simulated ms ( for @xmath65 ) shows the same spread in color as the observed one , thus confirming that the procedure is fully appropriate .",
    "the artificial star catalog thus obtained was used to derive the completeness curves as the ratio ( @xmath66 ) between the number of stars recovered after the photometric reduction ( @xmath67 ) and the number of simulated stars ( @xmath68 ) in each magnitude bin .",
    "the completeness curves as a function of the @xmath1 magnitudes for three different radial bins ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the distance from the cluster center of ngc 6624 by applying the algorithm of @xcite to evaluate , through an iterative procedure , the `` density center '' of the stellar positions , i.e. their average position weighted by the local number density ( for more details , see @xcite ) . using various initial searching radii , ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath73 , and applying a cut in magnitude @xmath1 = 18 to avoid incompleteness , we finally found @xmath74 , @xmath75 with an uncertainty of about @xmath76 . ] )",
    "are shown in figure [ compl ] .",
    "this clearly testify to a high ( 90 - 100% ) photometric completeness of the gemini catalog down to @xmath77 , depending on the distance from the center .      in order to derive the ms - lf of ngc 6624 we adopted the radial bins defined for the determination of the completeness curves ( see section [ artificial ] ) .",
    "starting from the ( @xmath40 ) cmd , we selected a sample of bona - fide ms stars defined as those stars located within 2.5@xmath16 from the mrl , where @xmath16 is the combined photometric uncertainty in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "for each radial interval , we considered only the stars with @xmath1 magnitude ranging between 16 and the value corresponding to a completeness factor @xmath78 , namely @xmath1 = 20.35 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath70 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the observed lf obtained in each radial interval was thus corrected for incompleteness by adopting the appropriate value of @xmath83 in each bin of magnitude .",
    "the completeness - corrected lf was then decontaminated from the effect of field stars by using the besanon simulation of our galaxy @xcite for a region of about 2.5@xmath84 squared centered on ngc 6624 , rescaled on the gsaoi fov . for each magnitude bin ,",

    "are shown . in order to compare",
    "the lfs obtained at different distance from the cluster center , the lfs have been normalized to the one obtained for the innermost region in the magnitude range @xmath85 .",
    "the comparison shows that the lfs are clearly different , with the lf in the outer regions of the cluster showing an overabundance of low - luminosity stars with respect to those in the innermost radial bin , consistent with the effect of mass segregation .",
    "this is in agreement with results by @xcite .    following a similar approach ,",
    "we have also derived the mf of ngc 6624 .",
    "masses have been estimated from the ` basti ` isochrone that best - fits the cmd , as discussed in section [ age1 ] .",
    "this provides a ms - to mass of @xmath86 .",
    "the mf covers a range in mass from @xmath87 down to lower limits corresponding to @xmath88 : @xmath89 for @xmath79 , @xmath90 for @xmath70 and @xmath91 for @xmath71 .",
    "the mfs are shown in figure [ mf ] , with the same color code as in figure [ lf ] to indicate different distances from the cluster center .",
    "we used the mf of the innermost radial bin as a reference and we normalized the more external ones by using the number counts in the mass range @xmath92 .",
    "as appear in figure [ mf ] and in agreement with what we obtained from the analysis of the lfs , the mfs show a clear variation of their slopes , flattening moving outwards .",
    "such a trend clearly demonstrates that this cluster has already experienced a significant degree of mass segregation . in general",
    ", all gcs are expected to show evidence of mass segregation , because of their short relaxation timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent results have shown that there are some exceptions : see the case of @xmath93-centauri ( @xcite ) , ngc 2419 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , terzan 8 and arp 2 ( @xcite ) , palomar 14 ( @xcite ) and ngc 6101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these examples suggest that either some mechanisms able to suppress mass segregation may occur in some gcs or that theoretical relaxation times may suffer of significant uncertainties . in this context",
    ", the study of the dynamical state of a cluster becomes quite interesting .",
    "this work is focused on ngc 6624 , a metal - rich globular cluster located in the galactic bulge . by combining the exceptional capabilities of the adaptive optics system gems with the high resolution camera gsaoi on the gemini south telescope",
    ", we obtained the deepest and most accurate nir ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath21 ) cmds ever obtained from the ground for ngc 6624 .",
    "the quality of the photometry turns out to be fully competitive with the optical photometry from the hst . the derived cmds span a range of more than 8 magnitudes , allowing to identify all the well known evolutionary sequences , from the hb level to the ms - to point down to below the ms - k ( detected at @xmath1 @xmath94 20 ) , a feature observed so far only rarely in the optical band and identified for the first time here in a purely infrared cmd .",
    "we took advantage of our high - resolution photometry to get an accurate estimate of the absolute age of ngc 6624 , which is still quite debated in the literature . by adopting the ms - to fitting method , we determined an absolute age of about 12.0 @xmath5 0.5 gyr for the cluster .    taking advantage of this high - quality sample",
    ", we studied the ms - lf and mf at different distances from the cluster center .",
    "the level of completeness of the ms sample has been evaluated from artificial star experiments and turns out to be larger than 50% down to @xmath95 at any distance from the cluster center .",
    "the completeness - corrected and field - decontaminated lfs and mfs show significant signatures of mass segregation .",
    "in fact , moving from the innermost region of the cluster to the outskirts , the number of low - mass stars gradually increases compared to high - mass stars .",
    "this result confirms that ngc  6624 is a dynamically old cluster , already relaxed .",
    "the data obtained for ngc 6624 clearly show that , under favorable conditions ( for example the seeing of the observing night or the ngss magnitude ) , the gems / gsaoi system is able to provide images with similar spatial resolution and photometric quality as hst in the optical bands .",
    "we could also test the stability and accuracy of the gems + gsaoi system in performing stellar variability studies . to do this , we focused on the core of ngc 6624 .",
    "in this region @xcite discovered an exotic object ( star1 ) which has been classified as a quiescent cataclysmic variable or a lmxb .",
    "the optical counterpart to this object , named com_star1 , has been identified by @xcite to be a star showing a clear sinusoidal light modulation and an orbital period of @xmath96 @xmath97 98 minutes .",
    "we identified com_star1 in our gemini @xmath0 and @xmath19 images ( see figure [ comstar1 ] ) by using the coordinates reported by @xcite .",
    "it appears as a relatively bright star at @xmath1 @xmath3 17.76 and @xmath98 outside the ms on the red side ( it is marked with a red circle in the top panel of figure [ cmdcomstar1 ] ) .",
    "since the object is visible in all gemini images ( 13 in @xmath0 and 14 in @xmath19 ) , we could investigate its variability in the infrared bands .",
    "its light curve ( red dots in the _ bottom panel _ of figure [ cmdcomstar1 ] ) shows a luminosity variation with an amplitude of @xmath3 0.2 mag and is well folded with the same period ( @xmath99 min ) found by @xcite . for sake of comparison ,",
    "the light curve of a genuine ms star ( starb ) with comparable luminosity ( blue circle in figure [ starb ] ) is shown in figure [ cmdcomstar1 ] , _ bottom panel_. as expected , this star is a  normal \" non - variable ms , in fact its light curve does not show any evidence of flux modulation ( @xmath100 mag ) . + the constancy of the starb magnitude despite variation of seeing , airmass and psf shape in the images , implies that the system is largely stable and it can be used to successfully reveal also very small flux variations ( of the order of a few 0.01 mag ) .",
    "this test allow us to conclude that the gems / gsaoi system indeed has such a high performance and can be successfully used also for stellar variability studies .",
