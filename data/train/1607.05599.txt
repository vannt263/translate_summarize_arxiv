    "a series of solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , accelerator @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have proven that neutrinos have masses and mix .",
    "the mixing is described by the so - called pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite , which is parametrised by @xcite @xmath5 in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the three mixing angles have been measured to a good accuracy .",
    "their current best - fit and @xmath8 values from a global analysis of the available data @xcite are given by @xmath9 for the normal ( inverted ) ordering of neutrino masses , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we notice that the atmospheric angle @xmath12 and solar angle @xmath13 are rather large , with @xmath12 possibly being maximal , and the reactor angle @xmath14 takes a value around 0.1 , @xmath15 .",
    "the origin of this distinct mixing structure remains unexplained .",
    "discrete flavour symmetries have been widely used to address these questions .",
    "it is assumed that at some high energy scale , there exists an underlying discrete flavour symmetry , @xmath16 , which unifies the three flavours together . the tetrahedral group @xmath0 @xcite , which is the smallest group containing 3-dimensional irreducible representations , is the most famous example of this type .",
    "there are other commonly - used groups , such as @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath20 @xcite . at a lower energy scale ,",
    "the flavour symmetry is broken , leading to nontrivial flavour mixing .",
    "most models are built in the framework of the so - called `` direct '' or `` semi - direct '' approaches @xcite . in these cases , different residual symmetries ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 , subgroups of @xmath16 , are preserved in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , respectively after the whole flavour symmetry @xmath16 breaking . by choosing different @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "special flavour structures arise . in the direct approach ,",
    "the mixing matrix is fully determined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 up to majorana phases and column or row permutations of the pmns matrix . in the semi - direct approach , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "can not fully determine flavour mixing and an accidental symmetry is necessary .",
    "for instance , in models based on @xmath0 , the tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing pattern @xcite , which predicts @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , can be realised in the semi - direct approach @xcite .",
    "the residual symmetries are chosen to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while an additional @xmath28 symmetry , not belonging to @xmath0 , arises accidentally in the neutrino sector . in models of @xmath17 , the residual @xmath29",
    "all belong to @xmath17 , so tbm can be obtained in the direct approach @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 can predict another mixing pattern , the bimaximal mixing one ( @xmath30 , @xmath25 ) @xcite by choosing @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "some other mixing patterns can be arranged using larger groups in the direct approach , for instance , the golden - ratio mixing ( @xmath32 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) @xcite predicted by @xmath18 @xcite and the toorop - feruglio - hagedorn mixing ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) predicted by @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the predicted values of @xmath14 in all these mixing patterns is not in agreement with the data .",
    "this suggests that small corrections should be introduced and the residual symmetries should be slightly broken .",
    "a common approach to realise the breaking of @xmath16 is to introduce flavons , new scalars that couple to fermions and have non - trivial properties under the flavour symmetry .",
    "these scalars get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , leading to the spontaneous breaking of the flavour symmetry and leaving residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , respectively . at least two flavon multiplets , one for charged leptons and the other for neutrinos , have to be introduced to guarantee different residual symmetries in the two sectors . the well - known and simplest case is the realisation of tbm in @xmath0 models @xcite . in models with larger symmetry groups , more flavon multiplets may be needed for model constructions @xcite .",
    "the slight breaking of the residual symmetries can be provided by additional interactions of flavons .",
    "the latter may be directly from higher - dimensional operators in the couplings between flavons and leptons @xcite . in our recent paper @xcite",
    ", we observe that cross coupling between neutrino and charged lepton flavons can shift the vevs from their original @xmath1 and @xmath35 symmetric values . in the models based on @xmath0 , we studied in detail the modification to the tbm flavour mixing pattern , in particular conserving the origin of non - zero @xmath14 and dirac - type cp violation .",
    "the interactions of flavons and leptons , in addition to ensuring special yukawa structures in the lepton sector , may also contribute to other processes and in particular lead to lepton - flavour - violating ( lfv ) processes .",
    "most flavour models assume that the flavour symmetry is broken at a very high scale such that these processes are too suppressed to be observed . however , the scale of flavour symmetry is not known and could be much lower than commonly considered .",
    "an electroweak - scale flavour symmetry has recently been discussed @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "for instance , some flavons are formed by multi - higgs ( @xmath36 scalar doublets ) , their vevs must be below the electroweak scale . if the scale and the flavon masses are sufficiently low , there would be some testable signatures , especially in charged lfv decay channels . measuring these processes would provide important clues to identify the origins of leptonic flavour mixing .",
    "the lfv decays of charged leptons induced by flavons can be divided into two classes : those preserving the residual symmetry in the charged lepton sector and those breaking it . in @xmath0 models ,",
    "the only processes allowed by the @xmath1 residual symmetry are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and all other 3-body and radiative decays are forbidden @xcite .",
    "the latter can take place if the @xmath1 symmetry is broken @xcite , but are typically suppressed due to the consistency with oscillation data , as shown later .",
    "current experimental bounds of the branching ratios of lfv @xmath39 3-body decays @xmath40 , and ratiative decays @xmath41 are in general around @xmath42 , measured by belle @xcite and babar @xcite , respectively .",
    "the upper limit of the @xmath43 3-body decay @xmath44 decay is @xmath45 at 90 % c.l .",
    ", from the sindrum experiment @xcite .",
    "the most stringent measurement is @xmath46 in the meg experiment , with branching ratio @xmath47 at 90% c.l .",
    "a meg upgrade ( meg ii ) is envisaged to reach the upper limit of the branching ratio to @xmath48 in the near future @xcite .",
    "one may expect these experiments provide important constraints to the scale of flavour symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a generic method to analyse charged lfv processes in models with discrete flavour symmetries . for definiteness , we choose to work on models based on @xmath0 , which we review in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we give a model - independent discussion of charged lfv processes induced by flavons .",
    "we derive the expressions of leading flavon contributions to @xmath1-preserving lfv processes and specify different @xmath1-breaking effects contributions to @xmath1-breaking processes . since the latter are strongly dependent upon the model construction , we list two models and analyse them in detail in section 4 . these models , which have been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , are very economical and consistent with current oscillation data .",

    "* the flavons are complex triplets of @xmath0 .",

    "these flavons give explanation to lepton flavour mixing in flavour models and contribute to the other lfv processes beyond neutrino oscillations .",
    "different from most models assuming the flavour symmetry at very high energy scale to avoid the strong constraints from charged lfv processes , we have checked that a relatively low - scale flavour symmetry , not far from the electroweak scale , is consistent with current experiment constraints from charged lfv processes .",
    "the main reason is that since these models give explanation to the flavour mixing , the couplings between flavons and charged leptons should be reasonably suppressed by the charged lepton masses .",
