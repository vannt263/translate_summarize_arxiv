    "can be useful , in particular , for computations of the gromov - witten invariants of @xmath1 as holomorphic curves degenerate to graphs @xmath5 .",
    "a similar picture appeared in the work of fukaya ( see e.g. @xcite ) where graphs come as degenerations of holomorphic membranes .",
    "tropical geometry formalizes the base @xmath4 as an ambient variety so that the graphs @xmath6 become curves in @xmath4 .",

    "the remaining one , namely the rightmost in the middle row , has multiplicity 4 ( it has an edge of weight 2 shown by a bold line in the picture ) .",
    "thus the total number of tropical curves is 12 .",
    "should we choose a different generic configuration @xmath444 the number of tropical curves could be different .",
    "but their total number counted with multiplicities is invariant .",
    "e.g. there exists a different choice of @xmath444 where we have ten tropical curves , nine of multiplicity 1 and one of multiplicity 3 .",
    "in fact , no other partition of 12 can appear by example [ rdeg3 ] .    in @xcite",
    "there is also a version of theorem [ cp2 ] for other toric surfaces .",
    "note , that if the ambient toric surface is not fano then there is a difference between counting irreducible curves in a given homology class and computing the corresponding gromov - witten number ( as the latter also has a contribution from curves with some boundary divisors as components ) .",
    "tropical geometry has an advantage of giving a way to compute the number of irreducible curves directly without having to deal with those extra components .",
    "the same advantage allows to apply tropical geometry for giving an algorithmic answer to another classical problem of the complex geometry , computation of zeuthen s numbers , see @xcite .",
    "these are the numbers of curves of degree @xmath184 and genus @xmath128 that pass through a collection of generic points and tangent to a collection of generic lines in @xmath434 . here",
    "the total number of points and lines in the configuration is @xmath447 .",
    "these zeuthen s numbers also turn out to be equal to the corresponding tropical numbers , while the latter can be computed by a finite ( though quite extensive for large genus ) algorithm .",
    "as far as the author knows such computation in general is not currently accessible by non - tropical techniques .",
    "the number of real curves of degree @xmath184 and geometric genus @xmath128 passing via a collection @xmath433 of points in @xmath448 depends on @xmath435 even if we choose it to be generic .",
    "this is the feature of @xmath2 as a non - algebraically closed field . yet , as it was suggested in @xcite , one may prescribe a _ sign _",
    "@xmath449 to every such curve so that the sum @xmath450 of these signs becomes invariant in the special case of @xmath355 .",
    "the number @xmath450 is called the _ welschinger number_.    if @xmath435 is a generic configuration of @xmath451 points in @xmath448 then any real rational curve @xmath452 of degree @xmath184 passing through @xmath435 is a nodal curve , i.e. all singularities of @xmath452 are non - degenerate double points . over @xmath2",
    "there are two types of such nodes : the _ hyperbolic _ node , corresponding to the intersection of two real branches ( given in local coordinates by @xmath453 ) and the _ elliptic _ node , corresponding to the intersection of two complex - conjugate branches ( given in local coordinates by @xmath454 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath452 is defined as @xmath455 , where @xmath456 is the number of elliptic nodes of @xmath320 .",
    "the welschinger number also has a tropical counterpart .",
    "to a tropical curve @xmath457 of degree @xmath184 and genus @xmath128 passing through a configuration @xmath444 of @xmath447 points we associates its _ real multiplicity _ @xmath458 which is @xmath449 or @xmath272 . if @xmath352 has an edge of even multiplicity then @xmath459 .",
    "otherwise we define the local real multiplicity @xmath460 for a vertex @xmath461 to be @xmath462 , where @xmath463 is the number of integer points in the interior of the lattice triangle such that its sides are perpendicular to the edges adjacent to @xmath251 and of integer length equal to the weight of that edge .",
    "then we define @xmath464 .",
    "let @xmath465 be the corresponding tropical number .",
    "[ rdeg3 ] let us revisit example [ deg3comp ] .",
    "the real multiplicities of eight out of the nine curve of figure [ 9curves ] is 1 while the real multiplicity of the remaining one is 0 .",
    "thus we have @xmath467 . for another choice of a generic configuration of 8 points in @xmath438 mentioned in example [ deg3comp ]",
    "we get 9 curves with @xmath468 and one with @xmath469 .",
    "note that we always have @xmath468 if @xmath470 ; @xmath468 if @xmath470 if the multiplicity is 1 ; and @xmath459 if @xmath440 is even .",
    "note also that we may never get @xmath471 .",
    "since the sum of the multiplicities has to be 12 and the sum of real multiplicities has to be 8 the partitions @xmath472 are the only two possible partitions .",
    "in particular , there does not exist a configuration of 8 points in @xmath438 such that the 12 tropical cubics will all be distinct .",
    "there is a 3-dimensional version of the number @xmath450 which is the number of real rational curves in @xmath473 of degree @xmath184 passing through a generic configuration of @xmath474 points taken with certain signs , see @xcite .",
    "these numbers also have tropical counterparts and theorem [ wel ] extends to the 3-dimensional case providing a way to compute the real geometry numbers , see @xcite .    as the last application of tropical geometry we would like to mention extending the patchworking @xcite to curves in real toric varieties of higher dimensions by using theorem [ realize ] with real phases .",
    "let @xmath475 be a knot presented as an embedded piecewise - linear circle made with @xmath103 straight intervals .",
    "then there exists an algebraic curve in @xmath476 with a unique closed component in @xmath477 isotopic to @xmath27 such that its complexification has genus 1 and is punctured @xmath103 times .",
    "e.g. a trefoil may be presented by an elliptic curve with 6 punctures in @xmath478 , see figure [ knot ] .    to deduce this statement we perturb the broken line @xmath27 to make the slopes of its intervals rational .",
    "then we add an extra rays at every corner to get a tropical curve @xmath479 .",
    "finally we choose real phases for @xmath6 so that the phases of all its bounded edges include the positive quadrant .",
