    "recently , results from several high - statistics measurements of @xmath14 annihilation into multipion states have been published @xcite .",
    "one of the striking features in the data is a pronounced structure in the vicinity of the antinucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) threshold that appears either as a sharp drop for @xmath16 @xcite or as a dip for @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and for @xmath19 @xcite in the reaction cross section .",
    "earlier measurements with lower statistics had already suggested the presence of such a dip , cf . the review @xcite .",
    "phenomenological fits to the @xmath14 data locate the structure at @xmath20 gev @xcite or at @xmath21@xmath22 gev @xcite while the @xmath23 threshold is at @xmath24 gev .",
    "naturally , this very proximity of the @xmath13 threshold suggests that the @xmath13 channel should have something to do with the appearance of that structure in the multipion production cross sections .",
    "a common speculation is that it could be a signal for a @xmath4 bound state @xcite or a subtreshold @xmath4 resonance @xcite .",
    "such a conjecture seems to be also in line with experimental findings in a related reaction , namely @xmath25 , where a near - threshold enhancement seen in the cross section @xcite is likewise associated with a possible @xmath4 bound state , cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite . for a discussion of other structures seen in @xmath25 ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the complexity of the reaction mechanism one can not expect a microscopic calculation of those multipion production cross sections soon .",
    "indeed , so far there is not even a calculation that quantifies the impact of the opening of the @xmath13 channel on those reactions .",
    "the idea that @xmath26 and @xmath25 could be closely related is picked up in ref .",
    "@xcite for interpreting the drop / dip .",
    "aspects related to the question of an @xmath13 bound state are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is emphasized that ordinary threshold effects like cusps could also explain the structures seen in the multipion channels .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the significance of the @xmath13 channel for the @xmath27 and @xmath26 reactions . specifically , we aim at a reliable estimation of the influence of the @xmath13 channel on those multipion production cross sections around the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "the calculation builds on earlier works published in refs .",
    "this concerns ( i ) an @xmath15 potential constructed in the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) , that reproduces the amplitudes determined in a partial - wave analysis of @xmath23 scattering data @xcite from the @xmath15 threshold up to laboratory energies of @xmath28 mev @xcite and ( ii ) an analysis of the reaction @xmath25 ( and @xmath29 , respectively ) where the effect of the interaction in the @xmath15 system was taken into account rigorously @xcite and where the experimentally observed near - threshold enhancement in the cross section and the associated steep rise of the electromagnetic form factors in the time - like region is explained solely in terms of the @xmath23 interaction .",
    "note that the employed @xmath15 interaction is also able to describe the large near - threshold enhancement observed in the reaction @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the influence of the @xmath13 channel is done in the same framework as the studies mentioned above @xcite and consistently with them",
    ". it amounts to solving the following formal set of coupled equations : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the free @xmath15 propagator and @xmath33 , etc . here",
    "the first one is the lippmann - schwinger equation from which the @xmath15 scattering amplitude is obtained , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the second equation provides the @xmath34 transition amplitude , which was calculated in distorted - wave born approximation in ref .",
    "the third equation defines the amplitude for @xmath15 annihilation into the ( various ) @xmath9 and @xmath35 channels .",
    "these amplitudes will be established in the present work .",
    "luckily there is experimental information for all considered multipion channels , i.e. for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xcite , so that the corresponding transition potentials @xmath40 can be constrained by a fit to data . once @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are fixed the contributions to the @xmath45 reactions that proceed via an intermediate @xmath15 state , cf .",
    "the second terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) , are likewise fixed .",
    "note that the two lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) are equivalent .",
    "the only unknown quantity in the equations above is @xmath46 .",
    "it stands for all other contributions to @xmath45 , i.e. practically speaking it represents the background to the loop contribution due to two - step @xmath47 transition .    of course , it is impossible to take into account the full complexity of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 reactions . thus , in the following we want to describe the simplifications and approximations made in our study .",
    "first of all this concerns the reaction dynamics . following the strategy in ref .",
    "@xcite , the elementary transition ( annihilation ) potential for @xmath52 is parameterized by @xmath53 i.e. by two contact terms analogous to those that arise up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the treatment of the @xmath15 or @xmath54 interaction within chiral eft . the quantity @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] ) is the center - of mass ( c.m . )",
    "momentum in the @xmath15 system . since the threshold for the production of @xmath56 or @xmath57 pions lies significantly below the one for @xmath15 the pions carry - on average - already fairly high momenta .",
    "thus , the dependence of the annihilation potential on those momenta should be small for energies around the @xmath15 threshold and it is , therefore , neglected .",
    "the constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 are determined by a fit to the @xmath60 cross section ( and/or branching ratio ) for each annihilation channel @xmath61 .",
    "the term @xmath62 is likewise parameterized in the form  ( [ eq : vnn ] ) , but as a function of the @xmath14 c.m .",
    "the arguments for this simplification are the same as above and they are valid again , of course , only for energies around the @xmath15 threshold . however , since in the @xmath14 case this term does represent actually a background amplitude and not a transition potential we allow the corresponding constants to be complex numbers which are fixed by a fit to the @xmath63 cross sections .    in our study of the electromagnetic form factors in the time - like region",
    "@xcite we adopted the standard one - photon approximation . in this case",
    "there are only two partial waves that can contribute to the @xmath64 transition , namely the ( tensor ) coupled @xmath65 partial waves .",
    "we make the same assumption in the present work . for @xmath66",
    "there are no general limitations on the partial waves .",
    "however , since we restrict ourselves to energies close to the @xmath15 threshold and we expect the annihilation operator to be of rather short range any @xmath15 partial waves besides the @xmath67 and the @xmath68 should play a minor role . in the actual calculation",
    "we use only the @xmath67 partial wave .",
    "thus , the corresponding transition potential @xmath69 might actually overestimate the true contribution of this partial wave and , therefore , the resulting amplitude for the two step process @xmath70 has to be considered as an upper limit .",
    "judging from available branching ratios for @xmath71 @xcite , where near threshold only the @xmath68 can contribute , its contribution ( to the @xmath1 channel ) could be in the order of 20% of the one from the @xmath67 partial wave .",
    "note that there are selection rules for the @xmath66 transitions , because @xmath72-parity is preserved . for @xmath73 pions the @xmath72-parity",
    "is defined by @xmath74 while for @xmath13 it is given by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 denote the orbital angular momentum , and the total spin and isospin , respectively .",
    "thus , the @xmath72-parity for the six pion final states ( i.e. also for @xmath79 ) is positive which confines the isospin for the @xmath13 pair to @xmath80 in the @xmath65 partial wave .",
    "conversely , the five - pion decay mode can occur only from the @xmath81 @xmath65 @xmath15 partial wave .    the explicit form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) reads @xmath82 written here in matrix notation .",
    "the sum refers to @xmath23 and @xmath83 intermediate states .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath84 can be obtained by substituting @xmath14 by @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee6pin ] ) , those for the other amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls0 ] ) are given in refs .",
    "the quantity @xmath85 stands here symbolically for the momenta in the @xmath9 and @xmath35 channels .",
    "but since we assumed that the transition potentials do not depend on the pion momenta , cf .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] ) , @xmath85 does not enter anywhere into the actual calculation and we do not need to specify this quantity . all amplitudes ( and the potentials ) can be written and evaluated as functions of the c.m .",
    "momenta in the @xmath15 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath87 ) systems and of the total energy @xmath88 . the quantity @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee6pin ] ) is given by @xmath90 .",
    "since the amplitudes do not depend on @xmath85 the integration over the multipion phase space can be done separately when the cross sections are calculated . in practice , it amounts only to a multiplicative factor and , moreover , to factors that are the same for @xmath91 and @xmath60 at the same total energy @xmath92 .",
    "we performed this phase space integration numerically at the initial stage of the present work but it became clear that we can get more or less equivalent results if we simulate that multipion phase space by effective two - body channels with a threshold that coincides with the ones of the multipion systems . in effect",
    "the differences in the phase space can be simply absorbed into the constants in the transition potentials , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] )  which anyway have to be fitted to the data . all results presented in this manuscript",
    "are based on an effective two - body phase space .",
    "of course , this simulation via effective two - body channels works only for energies around the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "we can not extend our calculation down to the threshold of the multipion channels .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that also the validity of our @xmath15 interaction is limited to energies not too far away from the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "thus , we have to restrict our study to that small region around the threshold anyway .    with the definitions of the @xmath93-matrices above ,",
    "the cross section is obtained via @xmath94 and similarly for @xmath95 .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 denotes the phase space factor for an effective two - body system with equal masses @xmath97 , @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , or @xmath101 . for @xmath95",
    "the electron mass ( @xmath102 ) has to be replaced by the one of the proton .",
    "first we need to fix the constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the @xmath60 transition potentials .",
    "we do this by considering available branching ratios of @xmath23 annihilation at rest for the @xmath104 , @xmath1 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 channels @xcite . for the annihilation into @xmath104 and @xmath106",

    "@xcite we evaluate the relative cross sections at low energy and compare those with the measured branching ratios .",
    "specifically , we calculate the cross sections at @xmath107 mev / c ( @xmath108 mev ) because at this energy the total annihilation cross section is known from experiment @xcite and it can be used to calibrate the cross sections for the individual @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels based on the branching ratios .    our results for @xmath109 and @xmath110 are shown in fig .",

    "we fit to the central value of the branching ratios , 17.7% @xcite and 16.1% @xcite , respectively , and assume that the energy dependence is the same as for the @xmath104 channel .",
    "the resulting cross sections at @xmath107 mev / c are @xmath112 mb for the @xmath1 case and @xmath113 mb for @xmath114 .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the energy dependence is not too critical .",
    "important is first and foremost the absolute value of those cross sections close to the @xmath15 threshold because that value is decisive for the magnitude of the @xmath115 two - step contribution and , in turn , for the relevance of the @xmath15 intermediate state for the @xmath91 reaction .",

    "@xcite for details .",
    "exploratory calculations for the other cutoff combinations considered in ref .",
    "@xcite turned out to be very similar . like for @xmath15 scattering itself , much of the cutoff dependence is absorbed by the contact terms ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] ) ) that are fitted to the data so that the variation of the results for energies of , say , @xmath117 mev around the @xmath15 threshold is rather small . for consistency",

    "( 2.21 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite is also attached to all momentum dependent quantities here , for example to the transition potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] ) .",
    "because of the coupled nature of the @xmath118-@xmath119 @xmath15 partial wave , in principle , the @xmath120 wave should be also included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee6pin ] ) and , consequently , also in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnn ] ) . then there would be an additional contact term of the form @xmath121 @xcite , representing the @xmath60 transition potential from the @xmath15 @xmath119 state , and a summation over the intermediate @xmath15 @xmath119 state arises , in addition to the integration over the intermediate momentum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee6pin ] ) .",
    "we ignore these complications here because transitions starting from the @xmath15 @xmath120 wave are strongly suppressed for energies around the @xmath15 threshold and the contribution from the loop can be anyway effectively included in the contact terms of the transition from the @xmath15 @xmath77-wave state .",
    "once the contact terms in @xmath123 are fixed from a fit to the pertinent data the corresponding part of the @xmath124 amplitude that comes from the transition via an intermediate @xmath15 state is also completely fixed , cf .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) .",
    "we then add @xmath62 .",
    "this term is assumed to be of the same functional form as eq .",

    "specifically , this term can have a relative phase as compared to the contribution from the @xmath15 loop .",
    "therefore , in this case the parameters can and should be complex .",
    "since this background amplitude simulates a possibly very large set of transition processes it should have a weak dependence on the total energy in the region of the @xmath15 threshold and this feature is implemented by the ansatz  ( [ eq : vnn ] ) with @xmath55 being interpreted as the c.m .",

    "however , it was found that employing other combinations of @xmath130 and @xmath131 lead to very similar results and in all cases an excellent agreement with the energy dependence exhibited by the data could be achieved .",
    "thus , since isospin is not conserved in the reaction @xmath128 the actual isospin content of the produced @xmath23 could not be fixed .",
    "the mentioned selection rules for @xmath132 imply that the @xmath10 final state can only be reached from an @xmath80 @xmath118 @xmath15 state while @xmath56 pions have to come from the corresponding @xmath81 state .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the @xmath15 loop contribution to @xmath124 depends decisively on the isospin content of the intermediate @xmath15 state .",
    "we did calculations for @xmath124 with the combination as used in ref .  @xcite but it turned out that a slightly larger @xmath80 admixture , namely @xmath133 , is preferable and leads to a somewhat better overall agreement with the experiments and , therefore , we adopt this combination here . the cross section for @xmath134",
    "is also known experimentally @xcite , though with somewhat less accuracy .",

    "however , it can be easily included because the @xmath25 transition amplitudes from the @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath14 states are proportional to each other , see eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",

    "it is practically constant and does not exhibit any structure .",

    ", in case of the @xmath1 channel the data could hint at a minimum at an energy slightly above the threshold . however , there is also some variation between the two experiments .",
    "further measurements with improved statistics and also with a better momentum resolution would be quite helpful .",

    "we have examined and explored various uncertainties that could be used to motivate an amplification of the amplitude but without success .",
    "for example , assuming that the @xmath25 reaction is given by the isospin @xmath139 alone changes the result only marginally and the same is the case if we take into account that the @xmath140 cross section could by slightly larger than the one for @xmath25 as indicated by the data in ref .",

    "the positive sign of the real part of @xmath144 indicates that the pole we found is actually located above the @xmath13 threshold ( in the energy plane ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pole moves below the threshold when we switch off the imaginary part of the potential and that is the reason why we refer to it as bound state .",
    "there is a distinct difference in the @xmath63 amplitudes due to the @xmath15 loop contribution for the two isospin channels , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ppbar6pia ] , and the modulus exhibits indeed the features one expects in case of the absence / presence of a bound state , namely a genuine cusp or a rounded step and a maximum below the threshold .",
    "however , the structure in the cross section is strongly influenced and modified by the interference with the ( complex ) background amplitude as testified by the results in fig .  [",

    "thus , at this stage we do not see a convincing evidence for the presence of an @xmath15 bound state in the data for @xmath106 and for the opposite in case of @xmath2 , say .",

    ", our results corroborate that one should see an effect of the opening of the @xmath15 channel in the cross sections of the considered @xmath63 reactions .",
    "thus , the observation of a dip or a cusp - like structure in that energy region is not really something unusual or exotic .",
    "as argued above , our calculation provides a fairly reliable estimate for the amplitude that results from two - step processes with an intermediate @xmath15 state .",

    "<S> we calculate the contribution of the two - step process @xmath5 multipions to the total reaction amplitude . the amplitude for @xmath6 is constrained from near - threshold data on the @xmath7 cross section and the one for @xmath8 multipions can be likewise fixed from available experimental information , for all those @xmath9 and @xmath10 states . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting amplitude for @xmath11 multipions turns out to be large enough to play a role for the considered @xmath12 annihilation channels and , in three of the four reactions , even allows us to reproduce the data quantitatively near the @xmath13 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the structures seen in the experiments emerges then as a threshold effect due to the opening of the @xmath13 channel . </S>"
