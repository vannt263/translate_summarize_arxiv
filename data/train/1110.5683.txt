    "the study of moduli spaces is an integral part of modern algebraic geometry and representation theory .",
    "it is thus very natural , if one is studying noncommutative surfaces , to wish to understand the various moduli spaces that can be associate to them .",
    "however , even in the commutative case , let alone the noncommutative one , very few examples have been explicitly computed  which is what we aim to achieve in this paper . a rich class on noncommutative surfaces , that has been extensively studied ,",
    "is that of orders on surfaces , which we now define .",
    "let @xmath5 be a normal integral surface .",
    "an * order * @xmath6 on @xmath5 is a coherent torsion free sheaf of @xmath7-algebras such that @xmath8 is a central simple @xmath9-algebra .",
    "@xmath5 is called the * centre * of @xmath6 .    for example",
    ", if @xmath5 is as above , then any azumaya algebra on @xmath5 is an order on @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is in fact a * maximal order * in the sense that it is not properly included in any other order . for a great reference on orders on surfaces ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since orders are finite over their centres they are in some sense only mildly noncommutative and many classical geometric techniques can be used to study them . in this paper",
    "we first fix an order @xmath6 on @xmath0 ramified on a union of two conics , and study two of its moduli spaces :    * the moduli space of line bundles on @xmath6 ( see definition [ linebundle ] ) , with a fixed set of chern classes , denoted by @xmath10 , and * the moduli space of left quotients of @xmath6 , with a fixed set of chern classes , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the first moduli space should be thought of as the picard scheme of @xmath6 , but one should note that since @xmath6-line bundles are only one sided modules , this is not a group scheme .",
    "borrowing terminology from its commutative counterparts , the second moduli space will be referred to as the hilbert scheme of @xmath6 and should be thought of as the space parametrising noncommutative curves on @xmath6 .",
    "not surprisingly , these two moduli spaces are intrinsically linked ; in fact we will prove that @xmath11 is a ruled surface over @xmath10 and that @xmath12 is a genus two curve .",
    "furthermore , by analysing the universal family on @xmath11 we will show that @xmath11 maps to @xmath13 with branch locus being two conics and their four bitangents .",
    "the inspiration behind this paper comes from @xcite where the authors , chan and kulkarni , study the moduli space of line bundles on an order ramified on a smooth quartic .",
    "the reader is highly encouraged to read that paper in order to better understand our motivation .",
    "we will explain similarities and differences between our approaches as we go .",
    "to enable us to begin our project , we use the noncommutative cyclic covering trick , described in chapter [ nctrick ] , to construct our order on @xmath0 . the key ingredient to this construction ,",
    "is a double cover @xmath14 , a line bundle @xmath15 and a morphism @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the covering involution . using this data",
    "one constructs a sheaf of algebras @xmath6 on @xmath18 which is an order on @xmath19 .",
    "the main tool we use for studying @xmath6-modules is the simple observation that any such module is also naturally an @xmath20-module .",
    "in particular , this allows us to talk about the chern classes and semistability of @xmath6-modules when viewed as @xmath20-modules .",
    "furthermore , we will see that any @xmath6-line bundle is a rank two vector bundle on @xmath18 , and so their study is rather different to the study of the picard scheme of @xmath18 and much closer related to the study of rank two vector bundles .",
    "the main points of difference are that , first of all , @xmath6-line bundles do not form a group for they are only left @xmath6-modules and so their moduli space is not naturally a group scheme .",
    "furthermore , the second chern class , which is zero when one looks at line bundles in the usual setting , plays a crucial role in their study , as do semistability considerations .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in studying those @xmath6-line bundles which have minimal second chern class .",
    "it is certainly not obvious that one can place a bound on the second chern class of @xmath6-line bundles and hence talk about those @xmath6-line bundles with `` minimal second chern class '' . for chan and kulkarni , this",
    "was achieved easily from the fact that for them , @xmath21 was an isomorphism which implied ( proposition 3.8 in @xcite ) that any @xmath6-line bundle was automatically @xmath22-semistable and so by invoking bogomolov s inequality , this aim was achieved .",
    "the authors used the @xmath22-semistability property further by noting by simply forgetting the extra @xmath6-module structure , one obtains the map @xmath23 it is the careful analysis of this map that allowed chan and kulkarni to prove that their moduli space was a genus two curve .    in our case",
    ", @xmath21 will not be an isomorphism , and even though we will be able to deduce a lower bound for the second chern class ( proposition [ propdelta ] ) , the above map of moduli spaces will not be available for us , simply because @xmath6-modules will turn out to be not @xmath22-semistable in general .",
    "thus we will use a totally different approach .",
    "having bound the second chern class we will show that it suffices to consider only two possible first chern classes : @xmath24 with corresponding minimal @xmath25 and @xmath26 with corresponding minimal @xmath27",
    ". the former case will be rather simple and we will prove that the moduli space in that case is just one point",
    ". the latter case will be far more interesting and will be the prime focus of this paper .",
    "we will prove , in theorem [ quotientscomputation ] , that for any @xmath6-line bundle @xmath28 with this set of chern classes we have the following exact sequence @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a quotient of @xmath6 .",
    "this establishes a connection between the moduli space of line bundles with minimal second chern class and the hilbert scheme of @xmath6 which parametrises quotients of @xmath6 with specified chern classes .",
    "we will explore this connection in depth and ultimately prove :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath10 be the moduli space of @xmath6-line bundles with @xmath31 and @xmath27 and @xmath11  the hilbert scheme of @xmath6 , parameterising quotients of @xmath6 with @xmath32 and @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath10 is a smooth genus @xmath33 curve .",
    "@xmath34 is a smooth ruled surface over @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 exhibits an @xmath35 cover of @xmath0 , ramified on a union of @xmath33 conics and their @xmath36 bitangents .    in their paper , chan and kulkarni",
    "had a remarkably similar result concerning the moduli of line bundles with minimal @xmath37 .",
    "they also reduced the study of their moduli space of line bundles with minimal second chern class to two possible first chern classes . in the first case ,",
    "the moduli space was a point and in the second case , also a genus two curve .",
    "+ acknowledgements : this paper is a summary of the author s phd thesis . consequently , the author would like to thank his phd supervisor daniel chan for all his help , patience and inspiration .",
    "the author is also very grateful to kenneth chan and hugo bowne - anderson for all the helpful discussions .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the relevant theory of orders on surfaces . after this",
    ", the rest of the paper is primarily devoted to making sense of , and proving theorem [ mainthm ] . in section [ mod ]",
    "we will define and study line bundles with minimal second chern classes on the order @xmath6 from construction [ mainconstruction ] .",
    "afterwards , we will introduce the hilbert scheme of @xmath6 , which parameterises left sided quotients of @xmath6 .",
    "we will compute its dimension and prove that it is smooth .",
    "it is here that we will also explore the bizarre covering of @xmath0 that it exhibits and study its ramification . in the last section",
    ", we will prove that the hilbert scheme is in fact a ruled surface over the moduli space .",
    "finally using the map to @xmath0 we will be able to compute the self intersection of the canonical divisor of the hilbert scheme which will allow us to compute the genus of the moduli space .",
    "we have already defined the notion of an order on a surface .",
    "we will now describe the aforementioned noncommutative cyclic covering trick which we will later use to construct the order whose moduli spaces we will be studying .",
    "this `` trick '' was introduced by chan in @xcite and the reader is advised to look there , in particular sections 2 and 3 for all the relevant details and proofs .",
    "the setup is as follows : let @xmath38 be a normal integral cohen - macaulay scheme and @xmath39 with @xmath40 for some minimal @xmath41 .",
    "further , assume that @xmath42 is a scheme .",
    "given any @xmath43 , we can form the @xmath44-bimodule @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "suppose we have an effective cartier divisor @xmath48 and an @xmath49 such that there exists a non - zero map of @xmath44-bimodules @xmath50 satisfying the * overlap condition * ; namely that the two maps @xmath51 and @xmath52 are equal on @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath54 is an order on @xmath5 with multiplication given by : @xmath55{ll }                  l_\\sigma^{\\otimes(i+j)},&i+j",

    "orders constructed in this manner are called * cyclic orders*. we will almost always regard @xmath6 as an @xmath44-bimodule on @xmath38 , in which case we pay special consideration to the fact that it is not @xmath44-central .    note that if we want to use this method to construct an order on a specific scheme @xmath5 we also need a way of finding a scheme @xmath38 and an automorphism @xmath39 such that @xmath57 .",
    "we can do so , using the classical cyclic covering construction .",
