    "it was created in the setting of high dimensional manifolds .",
    "but some parts apply in dimension three .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present a proof of reidemesiter - singer s theorem ( as stated below ) in this way .",
    "i should say that francis bonahon , who like me was educated in the orsay topology group of the seventies - eighties , wrote such a proof ; but , his notes are lost .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be two heegaard diagrams .",
    "then , there are stabilisations @xmath3 by adding pairs of cancelling handles of index 1 and 2 , such that one passes from @xmath4 to @xmath5 by an ambient isotopy and a finite sequence of handle slidings .",
    "+    strictly speaking , only the first item is the statement of the reidemeister - singer theorem ; the reader is referred to the final comments at the end of this note .",
    "a _ heegaard splitting _ consists of a closed surface @xmath6 of genus @xmath7 , called _ heegaard surface _ , dividing @xmath0 into two handlebodies @xmath8 .",
    "a _ heegaard diagram _ is defined by a more precise data , namely , a handle decomposition of @xmath0 with :    * one 0-handle @xmath9 and @xmath7 handles of index 1 attached on the boundary @xmath10 , whose union forms @xmath11 ; * @xmath7 handles of index 2 attached on @xmath12 and one 3-cell @xmath13 whose union forms @xmath14 .    on the common boundary @xmath6 of @xmath14 and @xmath11 , the heegaard diagram specifies @xmath7 simple curves @xmath15 in @xmath6 , mutually disjoint , which are the cores of the attaching domains of the 2-handles ; their complement in @xmath6 is a 2-sphere with @xmath16 holes .",
    "it also specifies @xmath7 simple curves @xmath17 which are the boundaries of the so - called _ transverse _ 2-cells of each 1-handle ( with a terminology slightly different from @xcite , section 3 ) ; the complementary in @xmath6 of @xmath18 is also a 2-sphere with @xmath16 holes .",
    "+ the statement of theorem [ r - s ] can be translated into the language of morse functions as follows .",
    "recall that a morse function is said to be _ ordered _ if the order of the critical values is finer than the order of their indices . in dimension 3 ,",
    "an ordered morse function gives rise to a heegaard splitting by considering a level set whose level separates the index 1 and index 2 critical values .",
    "moreover , every heegaard splitting is obtained this way . along a path of ordered morse functions",
    "one has a heegaard surface moving by isotopy .",
    "stabilisation of a heegaard splitting consists of creating a pair of critical points of index 1 and 2 at a level keeping the ordering .",

    "an ordered morse function @xmath37 with a morse - smale pseudo - gradient @xmath38 gives rise easily to a handle decomposition .",

    "4 ) . of course",
    ", it is necessary to control the support of the deformation and insure that no extra critical point appears .",

    "we are looking at the local minima only .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "+ one can follow continously a minimum @xmath189 of @xmath23 from @xmath119 to @xmath190 . using that unnecessary crossings of index 0 critical values",
    "can be avoided , we may assume that the index 0 part of the cerf graphic shows no crossings ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "let @xmath191 be the maximal number of extra minima along @xmath164 ; we are going to decrease @xmath191 by 1 .",

    "denote the upper local minimum of @xmath23 by @xmath194 .",
    "assume that 3/2 separates the index 1 critical values from those of index 2 and set @xmath195 .",
    "if @xmath47 is a pseudo - gradient of @xmath23 , we see in @xmath196 the trace @xmath197 of the stable manifold @xmath198 and , when @xmath193 $ ] , the trace @xmath199 of the stable manifold @xmath200 . both are changing when handle slidings of index 1 happen .",
    "but , due to @xmath201 , they remain connected ; indeed , each one is always an @xmath202-sphere with holes .",
    "so , choose continuously points @xmath203 and @xmath204 linked by a simple arc @xmath205 in @xmath196 .",
    "we introduce a cancelling pair of critical @xmath206 of respective index @xmath207 in a collar neigborhood above @xmath196 ; the birth time is less than @xmath208 , the cancelling time greater than @xmath209 ( compare figure 3b ) , and the base of the birth cylinder is a @xmath202-disc in @xmath196 centered at @xmath210 .",
