    "with the availability of the complete qcd formulation of jet production to nnlo @xcite we are entering the precision era for extracting parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) from including these data @xcite in the global pdf analyses . however , we have to address the problem of the optimal choice of factorization scales .",
    "here there are two problems .",
    "the first concerns the definition of a jet .",
    "in particular , the vector sum , @xmath7 , of the transverse momenta of particles measured inside a jet cone @xmath8 is not equal to the transverse momentum @xmath9 of the parton .",
    "in fact , for large @xmath8 we may have @xmath10 when two large @xmath9 partons occur in the jet cone , while for small @xmath8 we have @xmath11 since , due to final parton showering , part of the energy is emitted outside the jet cone .",
    "the second problem is how to choose the factorization scales for the production of multi - particle systems which minimize the next fixed - order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) correction to this process .",
    "from a formal point of view , factorization scales are unphysical quantities .",
    "the final result should not depend on their choice .",
    "they are introduced into pqcd just for convenience to separate the part of the cross section described by the hard matrix element for the partonic subprocess of interest from the part that can be described by pdfs or fragmentation functions which are _ universal _ and do not depend on the particular subprocess .",
    "depending on the choice of factorization scales , a larger or smaller part of a fixed - order contribution is placed in the matrix element . as a rule ,",
    "it is advantageous to move a major part of the higher - order corrections into the universal pdfs and to minimize the remaining contribution in the matrix element .",
    "it is useful to illustrate the procedure in terms of a simple example .",
    "therefore before discussing jet production , let us first consider open @xmath12 production @xcite .",
    "the cross section for open @xmath12 production at lo + nlo calculated with factorization scale @xmath13 may be expressed in the form on the quantities in  ( [ eq : sta ] ) and the following equations .",
    "the matrix form of the equations is implied . ]",
    "@xmath14\\ , ,   \\label{eq : sta}\\ ] ] where the coefficient function @xmath15 does not depend on the factorisation scale , while the @xmath13 dependence of the nlo coefficient function arises since we have to subtract from the nlo diagrams the part already generated by lo evolution .    we are free to evaluate the lo contribution at a different scale @xmath0 , since the resulting effect can be _ compensated _ by changes in the nlo coefficient function , which then also becomes dependent on @xmath0 . in this way eq .",
    "( [ eq : sta ] ) becomes @xmath16\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : stab1}\\ ] ] here the first @xmath2 correction @xmath17 is now calculated at the scale @xmath0 used for the lo term , and not at the scale @xmath13 corresponding to the cross section on the left hand side of the formula . since it is the correction which _ remains _ after the factorization scale in the lo part is fixed , we denote it by @xmath18 .",
    "note that although the first and second terms on the right hand side depend on @xmath0 , their sum , however , does not ( to @xmath19 ) , and is equal to the full lo+nlo cross section calculated at the factorization scale @xmath13 .    originally the nlo coefficient functions @xmath20 are calculated from feynman diagrams which are independent of the factorization scale .",
    "how does the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath21 in  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) actually arise ?",
    "it occurs because we must subtract from @xmath20 the @xmath2 term which was already included in the lo contribution . since the lo contribution was calculated up to some scale @xmath0 the value of @xmath20 after the subtraction depends on the value @xmath0 chosen for the lo component .",
    "the change of scale of the lo contribution from @xmath13 to @xmath0 also means we have had to change the factorisation scale which enters the coefficient function @xmath20 from @xmath13 to @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we are allowed to use different scales @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the left and right pdfs respectively .",
    "the effect of these scale changes is driven by the lo dglap evolution , which is given by ^(0)(_f )  =   _",
    "s^2  pdf(_-)(c^(0 ) + ) ( _ + ) , [ eq : dg ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the dglap splitting functions acting on the pdfs to the left and right respectively . that is , by choosing to evaluate @xmath26 at scale @xmath0 we have moved the part of the nlo ( i.e. @xmath2 ) correction given by the @xmath27 terms of  ( [ eq : dg ] ) from the nlo to the lo part of the cross section . in this way",
    "@xmath20 becomes the remaining @xmath0-dependent coefficient function @xmath28 of  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) .",
    "the idea for open @xmath12 production at _ low _",
    "@xmath29 was to choose a scale @xmath30 such that the remaining nlo term does not contain the important double - logarithmic @xmath31 contribution ; in fact all the @xmath32 are resummed in the pdfs .    in this low @xmath29 limit",
    ", we may neglect the @xmath33 power corrections and the situation becomes left - right symmetric .",
    "thus we have @xmath34 .",
    "however , in general , and in particular for high-@xmath9 forward jet production , the behaviour of the ` left ' and ` right ' pdfs are quite different .",
    "for example , one incoming parton be mainly a gluon and the other may be a valence quark .",
    "that is why we reserve the possibility to have @xmath35 in ( [ eq : dg ] ) .",
    "although the discussion of open @xmath12 production has been carried out to nlo , it is possible to extend this procedure to higher orders , see for example eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in principle",
    "we may choose arbitrary factorization scales @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the incoming pdfs in ( [ eq : dg ] ) , accounting for the remaining contribution in the nlo matrix element ( coefficient function ) .",
    "recall , however , that the logarithmic integration @xmath38 over the incoming parton virtuality @xmath39 , hidden in the dglap evolution of the pdfs , does not extend up to infinity .",
    "it is limited by the exact form of the _ off - shell _ ( @xmath40 lo matrix element @xmath41 , which ensures that the integral is convergent .",
    "the best choice of factorization scale @xmath42 is such that the value of the logarithmic dglap integral up to @xmath42 is equal to the value of the convergent integral _ q_0 ^",
    "2|m^lo(k^2)|^2  =  ^^2__q_0 ^ 2|m^lo(k^2=0)|^2  =  |m^lo(k^2=0)|^2  ln . [ eq : i ] it means that we have moved to the lo pdf all the part of the nlo correction which has the same structure as that of the dglap evolution .",
    "this choice of scale is the best that we can do .",
    "of course , there are completely different nlo contributions which can not be reproduced by the evolution . for instance we can not move the nlo vertex correction to the lo pdf as it will not be reproduced by the evolution .    in order to calculate the value of the scale",
    "@xmath43 we need to know the @xmath39 dependence of the off - shell hard matrix element , @xmath41 .",
    "formally , it would appear to be best to calculate @xmath44 with one incoming parton off - shell .",
    "however , such a quantity is not gauge invariant .",
    "an alternative possibility is to use the axial gauge which provides a factorized ladder structure of pdf evolution which generates this off - shell incoming parton .",
    "another possibility is to consider the nlo subprocess where this parton is produced by a new on - mass - shell parton . for open @xmath12 production from incoming gluons",
    ", we may consider the nlo @xmath45 subprocess , where the light quark produces the off - shell gluon .",
    "we now return to inclusive jet production .",
    "as seen from the @xmath12 example , the value of the optimal scale , which minimizes the size of the next @xmath2 correction , is driven by the properties of the previous order @xmath2 matrix element .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg ] ) that we may choose the scales @xmath12 production we actually have only one scale @xmath46 .",
    "it was found @xcite that @xmath47 .",
    "] of the lo contribution which provides the most precise lo description of the process ; that is , which have the smallest nlo correction . in nnlo jet production the aim is to choose scales which provide the best accuracy of the nlo result .",
    "that is we choose scales which move the largest possible part of the nnlo correction into the pdfs and fragmentation function .",
    "these corrections ( including higher - order @xmath2 contributions ) will then be resummed via dglap evolution .      for jet production",
    "we have to account for the final parton showering .",
    "that is , we have to introduce a fragmentation function @xmath48 .",
    "again , in general , the factorization scale @xmath49 may be chosen to be different to the other scales .",
    "moreover , we can use different values of @xmath49 at each @xmath2 order ; each time making the corresponding subtraction in the higher - order terms , which will now depend on the values of @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in addition to the scales @xmath42 , we have a third scale @xmath49 such that the symbolic structure of the jet cross section is _ jet  =  pdf(_-)|m(_-,_+,_d)|^2(_+)d(z,_d ) .",
    "[ eq : comp ] these three scales at lo ( and another three at nlo ) should be chosen to minimize the nlo ( or nnlo ) correction .    formally , at fixed @xmath2 order ,",
    "the variation of each scale does not change the result .",
    "the advantage of choosing optimal scales is that part of the contribution ( for example the @xmath27 term in ( [ eq : dg ] ) ) is then placed in the pdf where it will be _ resummed _ by dglap evolution . in this way we account for an important part of the higher - order contributions .",
    "the three different scales provide the correct resummation in each pdf and in the @xmath1-function . on the other hand , this allows a better identification of the jet , and to reduce the probability of catching two different partons in the same jet cone . to achieve the latter objective",
    "it is better to work with a small jet cone size , @xmath8 . on the other hand , this means that jet fragmentation should be described by a lower scale @xmath50 , where @xmath9 is the jet transverse momentum .",
    "simultaneously a reasonable scale in the pdfs is of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , for the mercedes - like 3-jet configuration , corresponding to point - like production .",
    "the optimum expected scale is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mass of the whole jet system ( in analogy to the choice of scale for @xmath53 boson production ) . for back - to - back kinematics",
    "it is more natural to expect a scale @xmath54 .",
    "moreover for forward jet production in the ` left ' direction we do not have enough phase space for the evolution of the pdf@xmath55 .",
    "therefore we expect that a smaller value of @xmath36 will provide a better description of the process",
    ". that is , the final hierarchy of scales @xmath56 should provide the most convergent pqcd series .",
    "in particular it looks reasonable to have @xmath50 ,  @xmath57 but decreasing for more forward jets and @xmath58 but increasing as the jet is more forward .",
    "let us investigate this hierarchy in more detail , following the argumentation that led to ( [ eq : i ] ) . for simplicity , we work at nlo , though the procedure extends straightforwardly to nnlo and higher orders .    formally to calculate the optimal scales @xmath59 we have to consider the hard matrix element with off - mass - shell partons , and study its dependence on the virtuality of the incoming partons and outgoing jets .",
    "another possibility would be to consider the known next order @xmath2 correction .",
    "the corresponding formulae already include the respective dependences on the internal parton virtualities ; that is , the nlo cross section accounts for the virtuality dependence of the lo matrix element .",
    "the question is what is the best way to extract the contribution corresponding to the virtuality dependence of each individual parton from the full nlo cross section ?",
    "recall , that dglap evolution is written in terms of collinear factorization .",
    "therefore it is most convenient to order the contributions in terms of _ angles_.    to obtain the best lo description we consider the 2@xmath603 nlo subprocess . in the centre - of - mass frame of the jets we first calculate the angles @xmath61 between the final parton with the _ lowest _ @xmath9 and the other four partons participating in the process",
    "is not the polar angle , but is the full angle between a pair of jets . ] .",
    "dglap evolution produces configurations which are strongly ordered in angle . therefore it is natural to assign the contribution with the smallest angle @xmath61 to the evolution of parton @xmath62 .",
    "in other words we have taken the cross section for the nlo 2@xmath603 process and divided it into four parts @xmath63 corresponding to the smallest @xmath61 s with @xmath64 . in terms of ( [ eq : i ] )",
    ", the factorization scale corresponding to the evolution of parton @xmath62 should be chosen to reproduce the value of @xmath63 .",
    "note that in our single jet inclusive cross section we do not consider the fragmentation of the second highest @xmath9 jet , @xmath65 .",
    "therefore the part of the cross section with the soft jet approximately collinear with jet 4 can not be moved into the dglap evolution by any choice of the factorization scales .",
    "[ h ]    in summary , to determine the three scales for jet production at at nlo , we divide up the 2@xmath603 cross section @xmath66 into four parts , by measuring the angles to the smallest @xmath9 parton ( jet ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] . to be more precise , we compute ^nlo_j=+,-,d  =  _ ij   ( _ i-_j ) .",
    "then we choose scales @xmath59 such that the lo cross section calculated with these scales @xmath67 reproduces the corresponding part of @xmath68 ( like ( [ eq : i ] ) ) .",
    "to do this it is convenient to start the calculation from some _ low _ dummy scale @xmath69 . in this way",
    "we obtain a set of three equations , each of the form _",
    "j^nlo(_0 )  =  |m^lo(k^2=0)|^2_ij(_0)d_ij(_0)_j(_0 ) p^real(z )  ln [ eq : j ] that is , we open the evolution of one of the pdf@xmath70 s ( or @xmath1 ) according to ( [ eq : i ] )",
    ". the nlo component of @xmath71 describes the part of the evolution from @xmath69 to @xmath67 corresponding to the last term in ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "note that since we deal with the @xmath72 subprocess we use only the component of the splitting function belonging to real emission . in this way",
    "the set of three equations ( [ eq : j ] ) determine the optimum values of @xmath67 , with @xmath73 , for the respective @xmath74 evolution . since the loop corrections in dglap evolution are directly connected with the real emission component of the splitting function , in this way we also account for an important part of the nlo loop corrections .    to obtain more precise values of these @xmath75",
    "we can perform a few iterations replacing for @xmath76 the dummy starting scale @xmath69 by @xmath75 from the previous iteration .    as is seen from the example given in ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) , after the optimal scales are fixed , the final @xmath13 scale dependence of the predictions comes only from the variation of @xmath13 in the remaining nlo part of the cross section .",
    "this provides a much better factorization scale stability of the result .",
    "the same is true for the more general case of ( [ eq : comp ] ) .",
    "a similar prescription may be applied to fix the scales in the nlo part of the cross section . there",
    "we select the nnlo contributions which are approximately collinear with the incoming partons or to the highest @xmath9 jet in the final state .",
    "these contributions can be moved and absorbed in the nlo pdfs and fragmentation function convoluted with the remaining nlo matrix element ( see eq.(6 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "note that after the optimal factorization scales are fixed for the lo ( nlo ) part of the contribution , the dependence of the cross section on the universal scale ( like @xmath13 in ( [ eq : sta ] ) and ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) ) is considerably reduced , since it now comes only from the last term in ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) where the remaining coefficient function @xmath77 is small , while for ( [ eq : sta ] ) both terms depend on @xmath13 .",
    "this paper concerns only the factorization scale dependence of the jet cross section .",
    "besides this , the pqcd prediction also depends on the renormalization scale , @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the nlo and nnlo expressions for jet cross section contain contributions up to @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . recall that the choice of optimal factorization scales will , in general , reduce the higher @xmath2 order contributions .",
    "therefore we may expect that the dependence of the pqcd prediction on the renormalization scale , especially the part corresponding to configurations with three ( or four ) outgoing partons , will be reduced as well .",
    "it is important to also find the optimal factorization scales for the @xmath81 differential cross sections .",
    "this process is dominantly driven by @xmath82 fusion and allows an independent constraint on the large @xmath29 gluon pdf .",
    "again data exist ( see , for example , @xcite ) and the nnlo formulation is known @xcite .",
    "exactly the same procedure can be used for the subprocesses @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "one first has to study the nlo 2@xmath603 ( nnlo 2@xmath604 ) cross sections and to select the contributions @xmath71 with the outgoing gluons ( quarks ) approximately collinear to the incoming gluons ( quarks ) @xmath74 .",
    "these parts can be moved and resummed in the incoming pdfs at the previous @xmath2 order by choosing scales @xmath42 given by an equation analogous to ( [ eq : j ] ) . as a rule",
    "the @xmath81 data are presented in terms of the @xmath85 quark .",
    "therefore we have no problems with the fragmentation function decay the momentum of the @xmath86 quark jet is close to that of the @xmath87 meson due to the strong leading effect .",
    "therefore the effect of the resummation in the fragmentation function is minimal . ] and only two scales @xmath42 need to be optimized .",
    "since the jet is not an object that can be directly observed in a detector , it is usually defined as a group of secondaries emitted in a cone of size @xmath8 .",
    "the precise inclusive jet cross section depends on the particular jet searching algorithm . in order to compare the experimental results with pqcd the experimentalists have to use a monte carlo event generator to account for the corrections caused by the detector efficiency , by hadronization , by experimental cuts and the effect of the underlying events .",
    "the problems are , first , that we have no nnlo monte carlo .",
    "next , the present monte carlos do not have options to introduce different factorization scales in the three different components in ( [ eq : comp ] ) ; that is , in the ` left ' and ` right ' pdfs and in the fragmentation function",
    ". therefore k factors , which reflect the ratio of nnlo / nlo ( or nnlo / lo ) pqcd predictions , are used to correct the result obtained from the nlo ( or lo ) monte carlo .",
    "since the value of the nnlo remaining correction depends on the choice of factorization scale at the previous nlo ( or lo ) level , we have two possibilities . either to use the same unified scale as in the monte carlo , or , to obtain better precision , to calculate the nnlo+nlo+lo result using the different scales , as proposed in section 3 , but in calculating the nlo ( or lo ) denominator we still have to use the same universal scale as in the monte carlo .",
    "there is no reason to expect the k factor to be the same for different kinematical configurations of the produced jets .",
    "the higher @xmath2 order corrections caused by the emission of additional jets clearly depend on the phase space available for one or another emission .",
    "we emphasize the pqcd prediction for the cross section for inclusive high-@xmath9 jet production contains three different factorization scales .",
    "the choice of these scales is an uncertainty in the description of the jet data by pqcd . to improve convergence of the pqcd series",
    "we have shown that three different factorization scales may be used for the lo part ( and an additional three in nlo term and so on ) .",
    "two scales correspond to the incoming pdfs and the third to the jet fragmentation function , @xmath1 . indeed , _ all _ the factorization scale dependence of the nlo ( nnlo ) matrix element ( or coefficient function ) comes from the subtraction of the contribution included in the pdf ( or @xmath1 ) jet evolution .",
    "this subtraction is needed to avoid double counting of nlo ( nnlo ) contribution .",
    "we fix the factorization scale in each pdf ( or @xmath1 function ) to minimize the next @xmath2 contribution",
    ". then the part of the contribution transferred to the pdf ( or @xmath1 ) is resummed to all @xmath2 orders by the evolution .",
    "this provides a better pqcd description .",
    "we have shown how to determine the _ optimal _ value of each factorization scale at nlo ( nnlo ) based on the knowledge of the nlo ( nnlo ) contribution and on the _ collinear _ nature of dglap evolution .",
    "having fixed the optimal scales in the lower @xmath2 order term , the dependence of the cross section on the universal factorization scale @xmath13 is considerably reduced , since it now comes from the much smaller remaining higher @xmath2 order term .",
    "besides maximizing the convergence of the pqcd series , the introduction of different optimal scales also allows a better jet identification , since the scale used for jet evolution is causally connected with the jet cone size @xmath8 .",
    "this allows the variation of @xmath8 without affecting the incoming pdfs .",
    "finally we note that the proposed procedure can also be used to calculate the scales for inclusive @xmath81 production . in this case",
    "we need to optimize only two factorization scales .",
