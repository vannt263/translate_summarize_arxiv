    "a major unresolved aspect of ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) physics  @xcite is their composition and above which energy the flux is dominated by extragalactic sources . above @xmath6ev the chemical composition is basically unknown  @xcite . around @xmath7ev",
    "the situation is particularly inconclusive as hires data  @xcite suggest a light ( proton dominated ) composition , whereas other experiments indicate a heavy composition  @xcite .    as a consequence , there are currently two different scenarios : the `` standard '' one , where a transition from a steeper , galactic heavy component to a flatter , extragalactic component dominated by protons takes place at the ankle at @xmath1ev , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and a more recent one suggesting that this transition actually takes place at lower energies , namely around the `` second knee '' at @xmath0ev .",
    "this second scenario in which extragalactic protons dominate down to the second knee has the following consequences : first , since the observed spectrum above the second knee is quite steep , @xmath8 , the extragalactic proton flux has to cut off below @xmath0ev .",
    "this can be explained as a magnetic horizon effect : protons from cosmological distances can not reach the observer any more within a hubble time due to diffusion in large scale magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "second , the ankle would have to be interpreted as due to pair production of the extragalactic protons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out recently  @xcite , that this model can not afford injection of a significant heavy component above the ankle whose secondary photo - disintegration products in the form of intermediate mass nuclei would produce a bump around the ankle .",
    "injection of a mixed composition would also require a harder injection spectrum @xmath9 with @xmath10 , as opposed to the extragalactic ankle scenario with pure protons  @xcite which requires an injection spectrum @xmath11 .    in the present study we point out that these conclusions can change significantly in the presence of large scale extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) which may immerse the uhecr sources . in fact , uhecr propagation simulations are usually performed for mixed compositions of nuclei without egmf or in the presence of egmf , but restricted to pure protons .",
    "this is partly due to the increased difficulty posed by nuclei propagating in egmf : especially at lower energies , deflection can be considerable and require considerable cpu time . as a result ,",
    "this most general case starts to being studied only since very recently  @xcite .",
    "we will apply our recent work to a mixed composition similar to the one inferred for galactic sources , using the egmf obtained from the large scale structure simulations performed in ref .",
    "these egmf are highly structured in that they reach a few microgauss in the most prominent structures such as galaxy clusters , but is @xmath12 g in the voids .",
    "the observer is chosen in a low magnetic field region with some resemblance to earths actual environment .",
    "we note that other simulations suggest more concentrated egmf  @xcite and current observations do not allow to distinguish between such different egmf scenarios .",
    "in section 2 we present our simulations , in section 3 we discuss implications for the interpretation of the ankle , and we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we use natural units , @xmath13 , throughout the paper .",
    "we restrict simulations to energies @xmath14ev because of cpu time limitations due to strong deflection at lower energies and due to lack of resolution in the simulated egmf .",
    "we use the same approach as described in all detail in ref .",
    "specifically , we use a source density of @xmath15 , assuming the ( astrophysical ) sources  @xcite follow the baryons .",
    "we inject a power law up to maximal rigidity @xmath16 of @xmath17ev , whose index @xmath18 can be fitted to match the observed spectrum after propagation . to take into account cosmic variance due to fluctuations in source positions and properties",
    "we simulate typically about 60 realizations for the discrete source distribution .",
    "in addition , for each such realization , we dial 20 realizations for the source power which we let fluctuate by a factor 100 and for the injection spectral index which we let fluctuate by 0.1 around the average fitted @xmath18 , as in ref .  @xcite . for propagation , all relevant energy loss processes are implemented , including pair production , pion production , and photo - disintegration on the combined radio , cosmic microwave , and infrared background for all nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ref .  @xcite we now consider a more realistic mixed composition at injection that we define as follows :     ( histogram).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let the abundance of a nucleus of atomic mass @xmath19 at a given energy per nucleon be @xmath20 .",
    "if the spectra of all nuclei have a common slope @xmath9 , the injected differential spectrum @xmath21 for species @xmath19 at a given total energy @xmath22 is then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a normalization constant .",
    "the modified abundance factors result from conversion from @xmath25 to @xmath22 . in the present work",
    "we will assume @xmath26 for the proton fraction , @xmath27 for the helium fraction , see ref .",
    "for the remaining 1% nuclei with @xmath28 we follow ref .",
    "@xcite in adopting the distribution from ref .",
    "the abundance of a stable element @xmath29 in the galactic cosmic ray spectrum will be proportional to the product of the injection flux eq .",
    "( [ spec_a ] ) and the galactic confinement time @xmath30 which below the knee approximately scales as @xmath31 .",
    "since galactic sources are inferred to have an injection spectral index @xmath32 , galactic cosmic ray abundances below the knee will be roughly @xmath33 . with the choices for @xmath20 above , this results in abundances at fixed total energy that are consistent with observations in the knee region  @xcite within a factor 2 .",
    "below we will find that significantly magnetized extragalactic sources should inject a spectrum roughly @xmath11 to fit the data above @xmath4ev .",

    "the enhancement factor is given by @xmath44 multiplied by the sum of @xmath45 over the relevant parent nuclei for @xmath35 divided by the same factor for protons .",
    "as a consequence , at energies around @xmath4ev where photo - disintegration starts to become negligible , the steepening is only significant for incomplete spallation .",

    "a similar tendency was already seen in ref .",
    "@xcite for pure iron injection . as a result",
    ", a steeper injection spectrum has to be chosen to fit the spectrum observed above @xmath4ev , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "we note that around @xmath4ev the case of a mixed composition fits better than pure iron injection studied in ref .",
    "this is because pure iron injection gives rise to a bump at a few @xmath4ev , somewhat flattened out by the egmf .    , but for injection of the mixed composition with spectrum @xmath11 in the presence of egmf.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the more complete spallation in case of magnetized sources consequently leads to a spectrum closer to the pure proton injection case , see fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "note that in the case of pure proton injection , the observable spectrum is hardly influenced by egmf .",
    "the spectrum is in fact close to the `` universal spectrum '' which is independent of the propagation mode and applies if particle number is conserved and if sources are distributed roughly uniformly with separations small compared the characteristic propagation lengths , namely energy loss and diffusion lenghts  @xcite .",
    "note that , although highly structured on scales @xmath49mpc , our source distribution is roughly uniform on larger scales , with typical source separations of @xmath50mpc .",
    "in contrast , the universal spectrum is not applicable in case of mixed compositions since the number of cosmic rays is then no longer conserved . indeed ,",

    "the latter spectrum is certainly too hard to explain the ankle and would underproduce the observed flux below a few times @xmath7ev where the injection spectrum is not modified by interactions anymore .",
    "in contrast , the magnetized scenario may still explain the ankle as a pair production feature of an extragalactic proton population dominating at that energy , as we are now going to argue .     in the presence of egmf .",
    "the contour lines are logarithmic in steps of 0.25 dex.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the simulations show that confinement ( delay ) times at energies @xmath54ev are @xmath55s , see fig .",
    "this is indeed consistent with an analytical estimate of the confinement time of light nuclei of energy @xmath22 in large scale structures ( galaxy clusters ) of size @xmath56mpc with magnetic fields @xmath57 g , @xmath58 assuming bohm diffusion , @xmath59 .",
    "below @xmath4ev the simulations can not be used because the larmor radius of charged particles becomes smaller than the resolution of the magnetic field in the simulation . however , extrapolating eq .",
    "( [ t_delay ] ) to smaller energies provides us with conservatively long confinement times given that bohm diffusion gives the smallest possible diffusion coefficient .",

    "let us now assume complete spallation above @xmath62ev , and no spallation below .",

    "this composition was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as the red histogram .",
    "injection of a mixed extragalactic ultra - high energy cosmic ray population with composition similar to the one inferred for galactic sources requires a relatively soft injection spectrum @xmath11 if sources are significantly magnetized .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of negligible magnetic fields which requires harder injection spectra @xmath46 because of increased secondary fluxes of lower energy light nuclei produced in incomplete photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei . whereas the latter case requires a galactic component below the ankle , the magnetized case with mixed composition",
    "may still explain the ankle as pair production of an extragalactic component dominated by protons and light nuclei piling up around @xmath4ev .",
    "this light component dominates the flux around the ankle and is caused by increased spallation of the injected mixed composition due to considerable deflection around the sources . at energies @xmath75ev the flux may still be extragalactic , but the observed composition should approach the one injected at a given total energy , and may thus have a significant heavy component .",
    "if one believes that uhecr are produced by relativistic shock acceleration favoring spectral indices @xmath10  @xcite , then injection of a mixed composition around considerably magnetized sources is disfavored .",
    "this argument may not , however , be very strong since there are indications that the spectral index for relativistic shock acceleration may not be universal  @xcite .",
    "our results provide yet another example how structured large scale magnetic fields can modify spectra and scenarios not only for discrete ultra - high energy cosmic ray sources  @xcite , but also for the cosmological sources of the diffuse flux .",
    "in addition , the impact of magnetic fields on the spectrum depends considerably on the injected composition : for pure proton injection , the effect is insignificant and the spectrum is close to the universal spectrum for small source separations .",
    "in contrast , for a mixed composition close to the one inferred for galactic sources considered in the present work , magnetic fields can modify the spectrum considerably , and even stronger than for pure iron injection .",
    "we also stress that observation of a heavy composition @xmath76 above @xmath62ev would be almost impossible to explain by standard scenarios involving extragalactic sources at distances of tens of mpc injecting compositions comparable to the ones inferred for galactic sources .",
