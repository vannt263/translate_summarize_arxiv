    "the first - order anisotropic flow is named as the directed flow ( @xmath6 ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , and it contains the rapidity - odd component and the rapidity - even component . the rapidity - odd component @xmath7 , which is traditionally called the sideward flow , is attributed to the collective sidewards deflection of particles .",
    "the rapidity - even component @xmath8 was realized recently  @xcite , and it is attributed to the event - by - event fluctuation in the initial state of the colliding nuclei . in the present study we only talk about the rapidity - odd component of the directed flow .",
    "both hydrodynamic @xcite and transport model @xcite studies have shown that @xmath9 in the midrapidity region , especially that for baryons , is sensitive to the equation of state ( eos ) of the produced matter . with the increasing collision energies ,",
    "these calculations predict that the slope of @xmath6 for charged particles near mid - rapidity region changes from positive to negative , which is named in the literature as the `` antiflow ''  @xcite , the `` third flow component ''  @xcite , or the `` wiggle '' @xcite .",
    "it is argued that this phenomenon could be a possible signature of the phase transition , originating from the softness of the eos in the hadron - quark mixed phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of the eos could be understood only if the directed flow from the cascade scenario without mean - field potentials is well settled .",
    "in addition , the effect of hadronization on the directed flow has not attracted much attention yet .",
    "recently , rhic - star collaboration have reported the directed flow of protons and pions in the beam - energy - scan program  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the slope of the net - proton directed flow changes sign twice between @xmath1 = 11.5 gev and 39 gev , and has a minimum between @xmath1 = 11.5 gev and 19.6 gev . besides",
    ", splittings of the directed flow between protons and antiprotons as well as that between @xmath10 and @xmath11 were observed at lower collision energies but become small at higher collision energies .",
    "efforts have been made using transport model calculations  @xcite but none of them have described the experimental data of the directed flow at various collision energies very satisfactorily so far .    in this study we investigate the directed flow in relativistic heavy - ion collisions within a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite .",
    "different from the previous study  @xcite , we will study the time evolution of the directed flow in the partonic phase , the splitting of the directed flow between different quark species , and the effect due to hadronization .",
    "this study is carried out based on the original ampt model with only scatterings between particles .",
    "this serves as a baseline of the directed flow properties that one needs to understand before incorporating the eos or the mean - field potential .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] provides a brief introduction of the ampt model . the detailed analysis and discussions of the directed flow results",
    "are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "finally , a summary and outlook is given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the string melting version of the ampt model  @xcite , which is used in the present study , mainly consists of four parts : the initial condition generated by heavy ion jet interaction generator ( hijing ) model @xcite , the partonic evolution described by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) model @xcite , a coalescence model to describe the hadronization process , and the hadronic evolution described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model @xcite .",
    "the hijing model generates hadrons with proton - proton scatterings as the building brick together with the nuclear shadowing effect and the glauber geometry for the colliding nuclei at relativistic energies .",
    "the initial phase - space distribution of quarks is generated by melting hadrons produced in hijing , containing reasonable event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "the quark interaction in the zpc model is described by the partonic two - body elastic scatterings with the differential cross section given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the the standard mandelstam variable for four - momentum transfer . in the present study we set the strong coupling constant @xmath14 to be 0.47 and the parton screening mass @xmath15 to be 3.2264 @xmath16 , leading to the total cross section of 3 mb .",
    "the evolution of the partonic phase ends when the distance between quarks is out of the radius of the cross section .",
    "the hadronization is described by a spatial coalescence model which allows a pair of nearest quark and antiquark to form a meson and three nearest quarks or antiquarks to form a baryon or an antibaryon , with the mass and species of the hadron determined by the invariant mass and the flavors of these constituent partons . in the ampt version used in the present study ,",
    "hadrons are formed from nearest quark in coordinate space , while whether they are close in momentum space is not guaranteed .",
    "in addition , meson coalescence is proceeded before baryon coalescence in the ampt version used in the present study , which reduces the combinations of three quarks that are close in coordinate space and makes the baryon coalescence less realistic .",
    "an improvement can be done with mix - event coalescence  @xcite in the future . in order to see the effect of a more realistic coalescence on the directed flow , we have also checked with the dynamical coalescence @xcite based on the wigner function calculation which will be detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3]b and [ app ] .",
    "the spatial coalescence in the ampt model is followed by the art model that contains various elastic , inelastic , and decay channels to describe the hadronic evolution .",
    "in the present study , we employ the ampt model to investigate the directed flow in mid - central ( @xmath17 fm ) @xmath0au+@xmath0au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 and 39 gev , corresponding to the top rhic energy and a typical energy in the beam - energy - scan program .",
    "typically , we focus on the time evolution of @xmath6 , the splitting of @xmath6 for various particle species , and the hadronization effect on @xmath6 . the directed flow is calculated with respect to the theoretical reaction plane , i.e. , @xmath18 , in the present study .",
    "before we investigate the time evolution of @xmath6 , let s first have a global impression on the density evolution in the partonic phase .",
    "the density contours at time 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 fm / c in the @xmath19-@xmath20-@xmath21 plane , i.e. , the reaction plane with @xmath19 the direction of the impact parameter and @xmath21 the beam direction , in mid - central au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev and 39 gev are displayed in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , respectively .",
    "we found that a large amount of partons are formed before 0.5 fm / c .",
    "the strong interaction between partons lasts until 4 or 6 fm / c .",
    "after that the interaction becomes weaker , and the disk - like partonic matter moves away in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the density evolutions are similar at @xmath1 = 200 gev and 39 gev , although a higher quark density is observed at higher collision energies where the life time of the partonic phase is expected to last longer .",
    "the direction of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is intuitively labelled as the `` @xmath25 '' direction for the ease of discussion , corresponding to the positive flow and the antiflow .",
    "the relative numbers of particles moving in the `` @xmath26 '' and the `` @xmath27 '' directions determine the net directed flow .    -@xmath20-@xmath21 plane at different time steps in the partonic phase of au + au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev and impact parameter @xmath28 fm , with different colors indicating the quark number densities .",

    "the directed flow of quarks in mid - central au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev and 39 gev at different time steps is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , with the solid lines from a cubic fit of @xmath29 .",
    "the initial @xmath6 at both collision energies are very small as expected .",
    "as the system evolves , the slope of the directed flow at @xmath1 = 200 gev grows to a maximum negative value at around 4 fm / c and then gradually becomes positive , while that at @xmath1 = 39 gev grows to a maximum negative value at around 6 fm / c and becomes saturated .",
    "the maximum slope is larger at 39 gev than at 200 gev . on the other hand , the strong scatterings among partons mostly end around @xmath30 fm / c , and the interaction",
    "is expected to become weaker in the later dynamics , according to the density evolution shown in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "however , it is seen that the later dynamics reverses the slope of the directed flow at @xmath1 = 200 gev but is unable to reverse that at @xmath1 = 39 gev , due to the shorted life time of the partonic phase at lower collision energies .",

    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] that @xmath33 is almost equal to @xmath34 at the initial stage , corresponding to a zero @xmath6 .",
    "as the system evolves , two negative peaks grow at forward and backward rapidities , corresponding to the picture that more particles move to @xmath35 direction at forward rapidity and to @xmath36 direction at backward rapidities , i.e. , a net antiflow .",
    "as these particles are further accelerated in the later dynamics after @xmath30 fm / c in the beam direction , the peaks gradually move to larger rapidity regions . at the later stage of the partonic phase at @xmath1 = 200 gev , only particles that contribute to the positive flow stay in the mid - rapidity region , leading to a positive slope of mid - rapidity @xmath6",

    "since these quarks are melted from hadrons produced in hijing , the difference is attributed to the different production mechanisms of hadrons that have different baryon or isospin charges .",
