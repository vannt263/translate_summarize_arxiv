    "a central problem of quantum communication is how to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel @xcite .",
    "while information is sent through such a channel ( for example an optical fiber ) , the carriers of the information interact with the channel , which gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence and absorption ; an initially pure quantum state becomes a mixed state when it leaves the channel . for quantum communication purposes ,",
    "it is necessary that the transmitted qubits retain their genuine quantum properties , for example in form of an entanglement with qubits on the other side of the channel .    in quantum cryptography @xcite ,",
    "noise in the communication channel plays a crucial role : in the worst - case scenario , all noise in the channel is attributed to an eavesdropper , who manipulates the qubits in order to gain as much information on their state as possible , while introducing only a moderate level of noise @xcite .",
    "there are two well - established methods to deal with the problem of noisy channels .",
    "the theory of quantum error correction @xcite has mainly been developed to make quantum computation possible despite the effects of decoherence and imperfect apparatus . since data transmission  like data storage",
    " can be regarded as a special case of a computational process , clearly quantum error correction can also be used for quantum communication through noisy channels .",
    "an alternative approach , which has been developed roughly in parallel with the theory of quantum error correction , is the purification of mixed entangled states @xcite .    in quantum cryptography ,",
    "noise in the communication channel plays a crucial role : in the worst - case scenario , all noise in the channel is attributed to an eavesdropper , who manipulates the qubits in order to gain as much information on their state as possible , while introducing only a moderate level of noise .    to deal with this situation , two different techniques have been developed : _ classical privacy amplification _ allows the eavesdropper to have partial knowledge about the raw key built up between the communicating parties alice and bob . from the raw key ,",
    "a shorter key is `` distilled '' about which eve has vanishing ( exponentially small in some chosen security parameter ) knowledge . despite of the simple idea , proofs taking into account all eavesdropping attacks allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics have shown to be technically involved @xcite .",
    "recently , shor and preskill @xcite have given a simpler physical proof relating the ideas in @xcite to quantum error correcting codes @xcite and , equivalently , to one - way entanglement purification protocols @xcite .",
    "_ quantum privacy amplification _ ( qpa ) @xcite , on the other hand , employs a two - way entanglement purification recurrence protocol that eliminates any entanglement with an eavesdropper by creating a few perfect epr pairs out of many imperfect ( or impure ) epr pairs .",
    "the perfect epr pairs can then be used for secure key distribution in entanglement - based quantum cryptography @xcite . in principle",
    ", this method guarantees security against any eavesdropping attack .",
    "however , the problem is that the qpa protocol assumes ideal quantum operations . in reality , these operations are themselves subject to noise .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there is an upper bound @xmath0 for the achievable fidelity of epr pairs which can be distilled using noisy apparatus . _",
    "a priori _ , there is no way to be sure that there is no residual entanglement with an eavesdropper .",
    "this problem could be solved if alice and bob had fault tolerant quantum computers at their disposal , which could then be used to reduce the noise of the apparatus to any desired level .",
    "this was an essential assumption in the security proof given by lo and chau @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the standard two - way entanglement purification protocol alone , with some minor modifications to accomodate certain security aspects as discussed below , can be used to efficiently establish a _ perfectly private quantum channel _ , even when both the physical channel connecting the parties and the local apparatus used by alice and bob are noisy .    in section [ sec : qrandqpa ] we will briefly review the concepts of entanglement purification and of the quantum repeater , and discuss why it is interesting to combine the security features of entanglement purification with the long - distance feature of the quantum repeater",
    ". section [ sec : fact_of_eve ] will give the main result of our work : we prove that it is possible to _ factor out _ an eavesdropper using epp , even when the apparatus used by alice and bob is noisy .",
    "one important detail in the proof is the _ flag update function _ , which we will derive in section [ sec : flag_update_function ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion in section [ sec : dicussion ] .",
    "as two - way entanglement purification protocols ( 2epp ) play an important role in this paper , we will briefly review one example of a a recurrence protocol which was described in @xcite , and called _ quantum privacy amplification _ ( qpa ) by the authors .",
    "it is important to note that we distinguish the entanglement purification _ protocol _ from the distillation _ process _ :",
    "the first consists of probabilistic local operations ( unitary rotations and measurements ) , where two pairs of qubits are combined , and either one or zero pairs are kept , depending on the measurement outcomes . the latter , on the other hand , is the procedure where the purification protocol is applied to large ensemble of pairs recursively ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : ep_prot_and_proc ] ) ) .",
    "the entanglement purification protocol ( a ) and the entanglement distillation process ( b ) . ]    in the quantum privacy amplification 2epp , two pairs of qubits , shared by alice and bob , are considered to be in the state @xmath1 . without loss of generality ( see later ) , we may assume that the state of the pairs is of the bell - diagonal form , @xmath2 following @xcite , the protocol consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "alice applies to her qubits a @xmath3 rotation , @xmath4 , bob a @xmath5 rotation about the @xmath6 axis , @xmath7 .",
    "alice and bob perform the bi - lateral cnot operation @xmath8 on the four qubits .",
    "alice and bob measure both qubits of the target pair @xmath9 of the bcnot operation in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "if the measurement results coincide , the source pair @xmath11 is kept , otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the target pair is always discarded , as it is projected onto a product state by the bilateral measurement .    by a straigtforward calculation",
    ", one gets the result that the state of the remaining pair is still a bell diagonal state , with the diagonal coefficients @xcite @xmath12 and the normalization coefficient @xmath13 , which is the probability that alice s and bob s measurement results in step 3 coincide .",
    "note that , up to the normalization , these recurrence relations are a quadratic form in the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these relations allow for the following interpretation ( which can be used to obtain the relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) in the first place ) : as all pairs are in the bell diagonal state ( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) , one can interpret @xmath16 and @xmath15 as the relative frequencies with which the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , appear in the ensemble . by looking at ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] )",
    "one finds that the result of combining two @xmath19 or two @xmath20 pairs is a @xmath19 pair , combining a @xmath21 and a @xmath18 ( or vice versa ) yields a @xmath20 pair , and so on .",
    "combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath15 that do not occur in ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) , namely @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are `` filtered out '' , they give different measurement results for the bilateral measurement in step 3 of the protocol .",
    "we will use this way of calculating recurrence relations for more complicated situations later .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite and , later , an analytical investigation @xcite have shown that for all initial states ( [ eq : bell_diagonal ] ) with @xmath26 , the recurrence relations ( [ eq : qpa_recursion ] ) approach the fixpoint @xmath27 ; this means that given a sufficiently large number of initial pairs , alice and bob can distill asymptotically pure epr pairs",
    ".      under realistic conditions , the local operations ( quantum gates , measurements ) themselves , that constitute a purification protocol , will never be perfect and thus introduce a certain amount of noise to the ensemble when they are applied by alice and bob .",
    "the follow questions then arise : how does a protocol perform under the influence of local noise ?",
    "how robust is it and what is the threshold for purification ?",
    "these questions have been dealt with in refs .",
    "the main results are , in brief , that for a finite level of local noise , there is a maximum achievable fidelity @xmath28 beyond which purification is not possible .",
    "similarly , the minimum required fidelity @xmath29 for purification has increased with respect to the ideal protocol @xcite .",
    "the purification regime @xmath30 \\in [ 1/2,1]$ ] has thus become smaller compared to the noiseless case . with an increasing noise level",
    ", the size of the purification regime shrinks until , at the purification threshold , @xmath31 and @xmath0 coincide and the protocol breaks down . at this point",
    ", the noise of the local operations corresponds to a loss of information that is larger than the gain of information ontained by a destillation step in the ideal case .    for a moderate noise level ( of the order of a few percent for the recurrence protocols of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , entanglement purification remains an efficient tool for establishing high - fidelity ( although not perfect ) epr pairs , and thus for quantum communication over distances of the order of coherence length of a noisy channel .",
    "the restriction to the coherence length is due to the fact that the fidelity of the initial ensemble needs to be above the value @xmath32 .    _",
    "long - distance quantum communication _",
    "describes a situation where the length of the channel connecting the parties is typically much longer than its coherence- and absorption length .",
    "as the depolarisation errors and the absorption losses scale exponentially with the length of the channel , one can not send qubits directly through the channel .    to solve this problem ,",
    "there are two solutions known .",
    "the first is to treat quantum communication as a ( very simplistic ) special case of quantum computation .",
    "the methods of fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite and quantum error correction could then be used for the communication task .",
    "an explicit scheme for data transmission and storage has been discussed by knill and laflamme @xcite , using the method of concatenated quantum coding . while this idea shows that it is _ in principle _ possible to get polynomial or even polylogarithmic @xcite scaling in quantum communication , it has an important drawback : long - distance quantum communication using this idea is as difficult as fault tolerant quantum computation , despite the fact that _ short _ distance qc is ( from a technological point of view ) already ready for practical use .",
    "the other solution for the long - distance problem is the entanglement based quantum repeater ( qr ) @xcite with two - way classical communication .",
    "it employs both entanglement purification @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite in a meta - protocol , the nested two - way entanglement purification protocol ( nepp ) .",
    "the apparatus used for quantum operations in the nepp tolerates noise on the ( sub- ) percent level .",
    "as this tolerance is two orders of magnitude less restrictive than for fault tolerant quantum computation , it seems to make the quantum repeater a promising concept also for practical realisation in the future .",
    "please note that the quantum repeater has been designed not only to solve the problem of _ decoherence _ , but also of _",
    "absorption_. for the latter , the possiblity of quantum storage is required at the repeater stations .",
    "an explicit implementation that takes into account absorption is given by the photonic channel of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper , as mentioned in the introduction , is to show that entanglement distillation using realistic apparatus is sufficient to create _ _ private entanglement _ _ between alice and bob , pairs of entangled qubits of which eve is guaranteed to be disentangled even though they are not pure epr pairs .",
    "if these pairs are used to teleport quantum information from alice to bob , they can be regarded as a _ noisy but private quantum channel_.    this will also prove the security of quantum communication using the entanglement - based quantum repeater , since it is only necessary to consider the outermost entanglement purification step in the nepp , which is performed by alice and bob exclusively , i.e.  without the support of the parties at the intermediate repeater stations .",
    "in particular , it is not necessary to analyze the effect of noisy bell measurements on the security . in the worst case scenario ,",
    "alice and bob assume that all repeater stations are completely under eve s control , anyway . for this reason , alice and bob",
    "are not allowed to make assumptions on the method how the pairs have been distributed .",
    "the role of the quantum repeater in the _ security _ proof is thus the following .",
    "it tells us that it is possible to distribute epr pairs of high fidelity over arbitrary distances ( with polynomial overhead ) , given that the noise level of the apparatus ( or operations ) used in the entanglement purification is below a certain ( sub percent ) level .",
    "the noise in the apparatus will reflect itself in the fact that the final distributed pairs between alice and bob are also imperfect ( i.e.  not pure bell states ) , and so the question arises whether these imperfect pairs can be used for e.g.  _ secure _ key distribution .",
    "the answer is yes . since the security regime practically coincides with the purification regime ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results_full ] ) , quantum communication is guaranteed to be secure whenever the noise level of the local operations is in the operation regime of the quantum repeater .",
    "in this section we will show that 2epp with noisy apparatus is sufficient to factor out eve in the hilbertspace of alice , bob , their laboratories , and eve .",
    "for the proof , we will first introduce the concept of the lab demon as a simple model of noise .",
    "then we will consider the special case of binary pairs , where we have obtained analytical results .",
    "using the same techniques , we generalize the result to the case of bell - diagonal ensembles . to conclude the proof , we show how the most general case of ensembles , described by an arbitray entangled state of all the qubits on alice s and bob s side , can be reduced to the case of bell - diagonal ensembles .",
    "in this section we will answer the following question : what is the effect of an error , introduced by some noisy operation at a given point of the distillation process ?",
    "we restrict our attention to the following type of noise :    * it acts locally , the noise does not introduce correlations between remote quantum systems . *",
    "it is memoryless , on a timescale imposed by the sequence of steps in a given protocol , there are no correlations between the `` errors '' that occur at different times",
    ".    the action of noisy apparatus on a quantum system in state @xmath33 can be formally described by some trace conserving , completely positive map .",
    "any such map can be written in the operator - sum representation @xcite , @xmath34 with linear operators @xmath35 , that fulfill the normalization condition @xmath36 .",
    "the operators @xmath35 are the so - called _ kraus operators _ @xcite .    as we have seen above , in the purification protocol the cnot operation , which acts on two qubits @xmath37 and @xmath38 , plays an important role .",
    "for that reason , it is necessary to consider noise which acts on a two - qubit hilbert space @xmath39 .",
    "( [ eq : operator_sum ] ) describes the most general non - selective operation that can , in principle , be implemented . for technical reasons ,",
    "however , we restrict our attention to the case that the kraus operators are proportional to products of pauli matrices .",
    "the reason for this choice is that pauli operators map bell states onto bell states , which will allow us to introduce the very useful concept of _ error flags _ later .",
    "( [ eq : operator_sum ] ) can then be written as @xmath40 with the normalization condition @xmath41 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise_model ] ) includes , for an appropriate choice of the coefficients @xmath42 , the one- and two - qubit depolarizing channel and combinations thereof , as studied in @xcite ; but it is more general .",
    "below , we will refer to these special kraus operators as _",
    "error operators_.    the proof can be extended to more general noise models if a slightly modified protocol is used , where the twirl operation of step 1 is repeated after every distillation round . the concatenated operation , which consists of a general noisy operation followed by this _ regularization _ operation ,",
    "is bell diagonal it maps bell - diagonal states onto bell - diagonal states , but since it maps _ all _ states to a bell - diagonal state , it clearly can not be written in the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) . however , for the purpose of the proof , it is in fact only necessary that the concatenated map restricted to the space of all bell - diagonal ensembles can be written in the form ( 4 ) ; we call such a map a _ restricted bell - diagonal map_. clearly , not all restricted bell - diagonal maps are of the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) , which can be seen considering a map which maps any bell diagonal state to a pure bell state .",
    "such a map could , however , not be implemented locally .",
    "thus the question remains whether a restricted bell - diagonal map which can be implemented locally can be written in the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) .",
    "though we are not aware of a formal proof of such a theorem , we conjecture that it holds true : the reduced density operator of each qubit must remain in the maximally mixed state , which is indeed guaranteed by a mixture of unitary rotations .",
    "we also have numerical evidence which supports this conjecture .",
    "note that in the case of such an active regularization procedure , it is important that the pauli rotations in step  1 can be performend well enough to keep the evolution bell diagonal .",
    "this is , however , not a problem , since alice and bob are able to propagate the pauli rotations through the unitary operations of the epp , which allows them to perform the rotations just before a measurement , or , equivalently , to rotate the measurement basis .",
    "this is similar to the concept of error correctors ( where the error consists in _ ommiting _ a required pauli operaton ) , as described in section [ sec : unitary_and_errors ] , and to the by - product matrix formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 in ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) can be interpreted as the joint probability that the pauli rotations @xmath43 and @xmath44 occur on qubits @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . for pedagogic purposes we employ the following interpretation of ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) :",
    "imagine that there is a ( ficticious ) little demon in alice s laboratory  the `` lab demon ''  which applies in each step of the distillation process randomly , according to the probability distribution @xmath42 , the pauli rotation @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the qubits @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the lab demon summarizes all relevant aspects of the lab degrees of freedom involved in the noise process .",
    "noise in bob s laboratory , can , as long as we restrict ourselves to bell diagonal ensembles , be attributed to noise introduced by alice s lab demon , without loss of generality ; this is , however , not a crucial restriction , as we will show in section [ sec : non_bell_diag ] .",
    "it is also possible to think of a second lab demon in bob s lab who acts similarly to alice s lab demon .",
    "this would , however , not affect the arguments employed in this paper .",
    "the lab demon does not only apply rotations randomly , he also maintains a list in which he keeps track of which rotation he has applied to which qubit pair in which step of the distillation process .",
    "what we will show in the following section is that , from the mere content of this list , the lab demon will be able to extract  in the asymptotic limit  full information about the state of each residual pair of the ensemble .",
    "this will then imply that , given the lab demons knowledge , the state of the distilled ensemble is a tensor product of pure bell states .",
    "furthermore , eve can not have information on the specific sequence of bell pairs ( beyond their relative frequencies )  otherwise she would also be able to learn , to some extent , at which stage the lab demon has applied which rotation .    from that it follows that eve is _ factored out _ ,",
    "the overall state of alice s , bob s and eve s particles is described a density operator of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 describe the four bell states as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : non_bell_diag ] .",
    "note that the lab demon was only introduced for pedagogical reasons . in reality",
    ", there will be other mechanisms of noise .",
    "however , all physical processes that result in the same completely positive map ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) are equivalent , can not be distinguished from each other if we only know how they map an input state @xmath48 onto an output state @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the processes must lead to the same level of security ( regardless whether or not error flags are measured or calculated by anybody ) : otherwise they would be distinguishable .    in order to separate conceptual from technical considerations and to obtain analytical results , we will first concentrate on the special case of binary pairs and a simplified error model .",
    "after that , we generalize the results to _ any _ initial state .      in this section",
    "we restrict our attention to pairs in the state @xmath50 and to errors of the form [ sec : any_initial_state ] @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "( [ eq : binary_noise ] ) describes a _ two - bit correlated spin - flip channel_. the indices 1 and 2 indicate the source and target bit of the bilateral cnot ( bcnot ) operation , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , using this error model in the 2epp , binary pairs will be mapped onto binary pairs .    at the beginning of the distillation process , alice and bob share an ensemble of pairs described by ( [ eq : binary_pairs ] ) .",
    "let us imagine that the lab demon attaches one classical bit to each pair , which he will use for book - keeping purposes . at this stage , all of these bits , which we call `` error flags '' , are set to zero .",
    "this reflects the fact that the lab demon has the same _ a priori _ knowledge about the state of the ensemble as alice and bob .    in each purification step ,",
    "two of the pairs are combined .",
    "the lab demon first simulates the noise channel ( [ eq : binary_noise ] ) on each pair of pairs by the process described . whenever he applies a @xmath54 operation to a qubit",
    ", he inverts the error flag of the corresponding pair .",
    "alice and bob then apply the 2epp to each pair of pairs ; if the measurement results in the last step of the protocol coincide , the source pair will be kept .",
    "obviously , the error flag of that remaining pair will also depend on the error flag of the the target pair , the error flag of the remaining pair is a function of the error flags of both `` parent '' pairs , which we call the _ flag update function_. in the case of binary pairs , the flag update function maps two bits ( the error flags of _ both _ parents ) onto one bit . in total , there exist 16 different functions @xmath55 .",
    "from these , the lab demon chooses the logical and function as the flag update function , the error flag of the remaining pair is set to `` 1 '' if and only if both parent s error flags had the value `` 1 '' .",
    "after each purification step , the lab demon divides all pairs into two subensembles , according to the value of their error flags . by a straightforward calculation",
    ", we obtain for the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath56 , which completely describe the state of the pairs in the subensemble with error flag @xmath57 , the following recurrence relations :    @xmath58    with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "steps 1 and 2 are required in order to treat correlated pairs correctly .",
    "note that steps 1 and 2 would also be required  as `` preprocessing '' steps  for the ideal distillation process @xcite , if one requires that the process converges for arbitrary states of the form ( [ rhoab_1 ] ) to an ensemble of pure epr states .",

    "however , it is a reasonable question why eve can not take advantage of the additional information which she has about the state of the pairs : as she is allowed to keep the information about the twirl operations in step 1 and 2 , from her point of view all the pairs remain in an highly entangled @xmath150-qubit state",
    ". nevertheless , all predicions made by eve must be statistically consistent with the predictions made by alice and bob ( or , for that matter , their lab demon ) , which means that the state calculated by eve must be the same as the state calculated by the lab demon , tracing out eve s additional information . as the lab demon gets a pure state at the end of the entanglement distillation process , this must also be the result which eve obtains using her additional information , simply due to the fact that no pure state can be written as a non - trivial convex combination of other states .",
    "in this section , we analyse how errors are propagated in the distillation process . as was mentioned earlier , the state of a given pair that survives a given purification step in the distillation process depends on all errors that occured on pairs in earlier steps , which belong to the `` family tree '' of this pair . each step of the distillation process consist of a number of unitary operations followed by a measurement , which we want to treat separately .",
    "consider an error @xmath174 ( i.e.  a random unitary transformation ) that is introduced before a unitary transformation @xmath175 is performed on a state @xmath176 .",
    "note that , without loss of generality , it is always possible to split up a noisy quantum operation close to a unitary operation @xmath175 in two parts : first , a noisy operation close to identity , and afterwards the noiseless unitary operation @xmath175 .",
    "for that reason , it only a matter of interpretation whether we think of a quantum operation which is accompanied by noise , e.g. as described by a master equation of the lindblad form , or of the combination of some noise channel first and the noiseless quantum operation afterwards .",
    "we call a transformation @xmath177 an _ error corrector _ , if the equation @xmath178 holds for all states @xmath176",
    ". equation ( [ eq : error_corrector ] ) is is obviously solved by @xmath179 .",
    "we want to calculate the error corrector for the pauli operators and the unitary operation @xmath180 , which consists of the bilateral @xmath6-rotations and the bcnot operation , as described in section  [ sec : qrandqpa ] .    in what follows",
    ", it is important to note that pauli rotations and all the unitary operations used in the entanglement purification protocol map bell states onto bell states ; it is thus expedient to write the four bell states as @xmath181 using the _ phase bit _ @xmath57 and the _ amplitude bit _",

    "consistent with this notation , @xmath54 is referred to as the amplitude flip operator , @xmath94 as the phase flip operator , and @xmath95 as the phase and amplitude flip operator .",
    "the effect of the bilateral one - qubit rotation in the 2epp can be easily expressed in terms of the phase and amplitude bit , @xmath188 and the same holds for the bcnot operation : @xmath189    the effect of the unitary part of the 2epp onto two pairs in the states @xmath190 and @xmath191 can be written in the form @xmath192 where the first and second pair plays the role of the `` source '' and the `` target '' pair . instead of ( [ eq : qpa_bell_pairs ] ) , we will use an even more economic notation of the form @xmath193 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath198 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : qpa_bell_bits ] ) and eq  ( [ eq : qpa_pauli_bits ] ) , we find that the error corrector for the error operation @xmath199 is given by @xmath200 independend from the initial state of the pairs .",
    "this is the desired result .",
    "as the 2epp does not only consist of unitary transformations but also of measurements , it is an important question whether or not errors can be corrected after parts of the system have been measured , and how we can deal with measurement errors .",
    "it is important to note that whether a pair is kept or discarded in the 2epp depends on the measurement outcomes .",
    "this means that , depending on the level of noise in the distillation process , different pairs may be distilled , each with a different `` family tree '' of pairs .",
    "this procedure is conceptually very different from quantum error correction , in the following sense : in quantum error correction , it is necessary to correct for errors before performing a readout measurement on a logical qubit . here , the situation is quite different : the lab demon performs all calculations only for bookkeeping purposes .",
    "_ no _ action is taken , and thus _ no _ error correction is performed , neither by the lab demon , nor by alice and bob .    in the analysis of the noisy entanglement distillation process",
    "@xcite , not only noisy unitary operations have been taken into account , but also noisy measurement apparatus , which is assumed to yield the correct result with the probability @xmath201 , and the wrong result with the probalility @xmath202 .",
    "surprisingly , if only the measurements are noisy ( all unitary operations are perfect ) , the 2epp produces _ perfect _ epr pairs , as long as the noise is moderate ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "the reason for this property lies in the fact that @xmath204 is a fixpoint of the 2epp even with noisy measurements . for a physical understanding of this fact",
    ", it is useful to note that in the distillation process , while the fidelity of the pairs increases , it becomes more and more unlikely that a pair which should have been discarded is kept due to a measurement error .",
    "this means that the increasingly dominant effect of measurement errors is that pairs which should have been kept are discarded .",
    "however , this does not decrease the fidelity of remaining pairs , only the efficiency of the protocols is affected .",
    "this fact is essential for our goal to extend the concept of error correctors to the entire 2epp which actually includes measurements : as was shown in [ sec : unitary_and_errors ] , noise in the unitary operations can be accounted for with the help of error correctors , which can be used to keep track of errors through the entire distillation process ; on the other hand , the measurement in the 2epp may yield wrong results due to noise which occured in an earlier ( unitary ) operation .",
    "this has , however , the same effect as a measurement error , of which we have seen that it does not jeopardize the entanglement distillation process .      from the preceeding two sections ,",
    "one can identify a first candidate for the flag update function .",
    "the idea is the following : the error corrector @xmath205 calculated in [ sec : unitary_and_errors ] describes how errors on the phase- and amplitude bit are propagated by the 2epp .",
    "for the lab demon , this means that instead of introducing an error operaton @xmath206 _ before _ the unitary part of the 2-epp , he could , without changing anything , introduce the operation @xmath207 as an error operation _",
    "let us now assume , as an ansatz motivated by the preceeding section , that the measurement which follows the unitary operation @xmath180 does not compromise the concept of error correctors .",
    "the lab demon can then consider the error corrector as an recursive update rule for errors on the phase- and amplitude bit , .",
    "for the phase- and amplitude error bits which constitute the error flag .",
    "anyway , he has to discard the target - pair part of the error corrector , as the target pair is measured and does no longer take part in the distillation process .",
    "the knowledge of the error flag of a specific pair implies that the lab demon could undo all errors introduced in the family tree of this pair .",
    "for example , if the error flag has the value @xmath123 , the lab demon could apply the pauli operator @xmath208 in order to undo the effect of all errors he introduced up to that point .",
    "now it is clear that the noiseless protocol asymptotically produces perfect epr pairs in the state @xmath209 .",
    "it follows that  in the asymptotic limit  a pair with the error flag @xmath123 must be in the state @xmath47 , the error flags and the states of the pairs are strictly correlated .",
    "this means , if the assumption above was true , then the flag update function would be given by @xmath210 .",
    "however , as we will see , the assumption made above is not quite true ; for that reason why we call this update function a _ candidate _ for the flag update function .",
    "the candidate has already the important property that states with perfect correlations between the error flags ( only the coefficients @xmath211 and @xmath212 are non - vanishing ) are mapped onto states with perfect correlations .",
    "however , using the candidate flag update function , perfect correlations between flags and pairs are not built up unless they exist from the beginning . by following the distillation process in a monte carlo simulation that takes the error flags into account ,",
    "the reason for this is easy to identify : the population of pairs which carry an amplitude error becomes too large .",
    "now , the amplitude bit ( not the amplitude _ error _ bit ! ) of a target pair is responsible for the coincidence of alices and bobs measurement results ; if the amplitude bit has the value zero , the measurement results coincide and the source pair will be kept , otherwise it will be discarded .",
    "if the target pair carries an amplitude error , a measurement error will occur , and there are two possibilities : either the source pair will be kept even though it should have been discarded , or _",
    "vice versa _ , then the source pair will be discarded although it should have been kept .",
    "obviously , the latter case does not destroy the convergence of the entanglement distillation process ( but it does have an impact on its efficiency ) ; as alice and bob do not have any knowledge of the error flags , there is nothing that can be done in this case , and both pairs are discarded .",
    "the first case is more interesting .",
    "it is clear that for pairs with perfectly correlated error flags this case will not occur ( due to the perfect correlations the amplitude error bit can only have the value one if the amplitude bit has the value one , which is just the second case ) .",
    "this means that we have the freedom to modify the error flags of the remaining pair _ without _ loosing the property that perfectly correlated states get mapped onto perfectly correlated states .",
    "it turns out that _ setting both the error amplitude bit and the error phase bit of the remaining pair _ to zero yields the desired behaviour of the flag update function , so that perfect correlations are being built up .",
    "the amplitude error bit of the target pair is given by @xmath213 .",
    "the flag update function can thus be written as @xmath214 for convenience , the values of the flag update function are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : error_flags ] .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : fact_of_eve ] , that the two - way entanglement distillation process is able to disentangle any eavesdropper from an ensemble of imperfect epr pairs distributed between alice and bob , even in the presence of noise , when the pairs can only be purified up to a specific maximum fidelity @xmath215 .",
    "alice and bob may use these imperfectly purified pairs as a _ secure _ quantum communication channel .",
    "they are thus able to perform secure quantum communication , and , as a special case , secure classical communication ( which is in this case equivalent to a key distribution scheme ) .    in order to keep the argument transparent ,",
    "we have considered the case where noise of the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) is explicitly introduced by a fictious lab - demon , who keeps track of all error operations and performs calculations . however , using a simple indistinguishability argument ( see section [ sec : eff_of_noise ] ) , we could show that any apparatus with the noise characteristics ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) is equivalent to a situation where noise is introduced by the lab demon .",
    "this means that the security of the protocol does not depend on the fact whether or not anybody actually calculates the flag update function .",
    "it is sufficient to just use a noisy 2epp , in order to get a secure quantum channel .",
    "for the proof , we had to make several assumptions on the noise that acts in alices and bobs entanglement purification device .",
    "one restriction is that we only considered noise which is of the form ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) .",
    "however , this restriction is only due to technical reasons ; we conjecture that our results are also true for most general noise models of the form ( [ eq : operator_sum ] ) . more generally , a regularization procedure ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec : eff_of_noise ] ) can be used to _",
    "actively _ make any noise bell - diagonal .",
    "we have also implicitly introduced the assumption that the eavesdropper has no additional knowledge about the noise process , eve only knows the publicly known noise characteristics ( [ eq : noise_model ] ) of the apparatus .",
    "this assumption would not be justified , for example , if the lab demon was bribed by eve , or if eve was able to manipulate the apparatus in alice s and bob s laboratories , for example by shining in light from an optical fiber .",
