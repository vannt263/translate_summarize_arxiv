    "the liquid argon large electron multiplier time projection chamber ( lar lem - tpc ) is a novel kind of double phase ( liquid - vapor ) noble gas tpc suited for the realization of next generation detectors for neutrino physics and proton decay searches  @xcite , considered as well as for direct dark matter detection  @xcite .",
    "the ionization charge is drifted towards the liquid - vapor interface , where it is extracted by means of an appropriate electric field produced by two grids . in the vapor phase ,",
    "townsend avalanche takes place in the high electric field regions confined in the lem holes , similar to the situation of the gas electron multiplier ( gem )  @xcite .",
    "the charge is collected by a set of segmented electrodes , on which the induced signals are recorded .",
    "the resulting charge multiplication yields a significant improvement of the @xmath3 ratio compared to the single phase liquid argon tpc  @xcite .",
    "the very high quality of the images and the @xmath4 measurement are key points to address the three - dimensional geometry of the ionizing events and to identify the involved particles .",
    "in addition the charge amplification technique is compatible with very long drifts , because it allows to compensate for the diffusion of the electron cloud and the potential charge loss due to electronegative impurities diluted in the liquid argon .",
    "the detector described in this paper was developed during the last three years and different tests of the charge readout devices were performed  @xcite . here",
    "we present the results obtained with a 1  mm thick large electron multiplier ( lem ) with an area of 10@xmath010  @xmath1 .",
    "the picture of the detector is presented in figure  [ picture ] .",
    "a set of field shapers , spaced every 5  mm , defines the drift volume , 20  cm long and with an area of 10@xmath010  @xmath1 . an electric field of the order of 0.5 - 1.0  kv / cm is applied to drift electrons vertically towards the liquid surface .",
    "the electrons are extracted from the liquid to the vapor phase by means of a set of two grids parallel to the liquid surface .",
    "each grid is made out of 100  @xmath5 m diameter stainless steel wires , spaced 5  mm . during operation the level of the liquid argon is precisely set in between the two grids and the voltages are tuned to obtain an electric field of about 3  kv / cm just below the liquid surface ( see the schematics in figure  [ scheme ] ) .",
    "schematic representation of the detector . ]    schematic representation of the detector . ]    the charge readout apparatus ( lem and anode ) is installed in the vapor phase 1  cm above the top grid .",
    "the lem is an electron multiplier with millimeter - size holes and a thickness of about 1  mm .",
    "it is a coarser and more robust extrapolation of the gas electron multiplier ( gem )  @xcite .",
    "the lem is produced with standard printed circuit board ( pcb ) techniques and the holes are mechanically drilled through the pcb plate .",
    "the drifting electrons are driven into the lem holes where a high electric field ( larger than 25  kv / cm ) allows to trigger the townsend avalanche  a detailed description of the working principle can be found in  @xcite . when the amplified charge leaves the holes , it is collected partially on the anode , installed 2  mm above the lem , and partially on the top electrode of the lem .",
    "the sharing of the charge between the two electrodes can be adjusted changing the electric field between the anode and the lem .",
    "each electrode is segmented into 16  strips 6  mm wide and the two sets of strips are orthogonal to allow the reconstruction of the x - y coordinates of the ionizing event , while the z coordinate is given by the drift velocity multiplied by the drift time . in table",
    "[ geometryparameters ] the geometry parameters of the lem are summarized .",
    ".[geometryparameters]geometry parameter of the described lem .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure [ gainvsfield ] shows the effective gain as a function of the _ nominal _  electric field @xmath6 in the lem holes , _ defined _ as the ratio @xmath7 of the potential difference @xmath8 applied to the lem to the lem thickness @xmath9 .",
    "the measurements were taken by varying the electric field @xmath6 , while leaving all the other parameters unchanged , as reported in table  [ fieldconfiguration ] . above 30  kv / cm we observe an effective gain larger than 1 , but it is eventually limited at 6.5 by the occurrence of discharges , primarily in the lem holes . the discharge pattern suggests that the voltage break - down are localized around regions of high electric fields , possibly close to the strip segmentation of the upper electrode of the lem .",
    "this observation led us to conclude that a promising alternative is to decouple the charge amplification stage from the readout stage with non - segmented lem electrodes .",
    "indeed , such a configuration was successfully implemented after the completion of this work and improved gain results will be published in a forthcoming paper  @xcite . in the new setup , the x - y readout feature was retained implementing a 2d  projective anode , based on the concept described in ref .",

    "in this paper we presented the successful and stable operation of a double phase lar lem time projection chamber over a period of three weeks .",
    "the gain was implemented with a 1  mm - thick lem .",
    "cosmic muons , recorded with very high quality imaging properties , were three - dimensionally reconstructed and used to evaluate the argon purity and the effective charge gain of the detector .",
    "thanks to a dedicated purification system , pure liquid argon could be obtained , reaching ppb o@xmath2 equivalent level in a few days , for drift paths of 20  cm .",
    "the maximum effective gain achieved , measured directly from a fit to the energy deposited by the cosmic tracks , was about 6.5 . a possibility to improve",
    "the gain performance is to avoid the segmentation of the top electrode of the lem , since in this configuration , break down discharges are often initiated in the high electric field regions separating the readout strips of the lem .",
    "the charge amplification greatly improves the imaging capabilities of the tpc making this charge readout technique interesting for next generation proton decay and neutrino experiments and possibly  increasing the maximum gain  for direct dark matter search experiments .",
