    "the strength of the interaction between an atom and the electromagnetic field is determined by the dipole moment of the atom and the mode volume of the electromagnetic field .",

    "cavity - assisted raman processes can be readily applied to superconducting circuit elements of the transmon - type @xcite , which are in wide - spread use because of their excellent coherence properties and the relative simplicity of their fabrication .",
