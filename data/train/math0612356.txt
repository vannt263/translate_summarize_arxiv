    "define a _ grid diagram _ of @xmath1 to be an oriented knot diagram for @xmath1 consisting of a union of horizontal and vertical line segments , such that at every crossing , the vertical segment crosses over the horizontal segment .",
    "any knot has a grid diagram . in the literature ,",
    "grid diagrams or their equivalents have gone by many alternate names , including `` arc presentations '' , `` asterisk presentations '' , `` square - bridge presentations '' , and `` fences '' .",
    "grid diagrams have been much studied lately , most recently because of their use in the combinatorial definition of knot floer homology @xcite ; for background on grid diagrams , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the _ arc number _ of a grid diagram is the number of horizontal ( or , equivalently , vertical ) segments in the diagram .",
    "the _ arc index _ of @xmath1 , written @xmath3 , is the minimal arc number over all grid diagrams for @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known that grid diagrams are closely related to legendrian knots from contact geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an introduction to legendrian knots ) . a front for a legendrian knot can be obtained by rotating any grid diagram slightly counterclockwise and eliminating each corner by either smoothing it out or replacing it by a cusp .",
    "conversely , any legendrian knot can be represented by a grid diagram .    in this context , the _ thurston  bennequin number _ @xmath4 and _ self - linking number _",
    "@xmath5 of a grid diagram @xmath6 can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the writhe of @xmath6 ; let @xmath8 denote the number of lower - right , `` southeast '' , corners of @xmath6 ( these correspond to the right cusps of the legendrian front ) ; and let @xmath9 denote the number of southeast corners oriented down and to the left , plus the number of northwest corners oriented to the left and down ( these correspond to the downward - oriented cusps of the legendrian front ) .",
    "then @xmath10 we remark that the self - linking number is usually defined for transverse rather than legendrian knots ; @xmath5 defined here is the self - linking number of the positive transverse pushoff of the legendrian knot , and can be expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the rotation number of the legendrian knot .",
    "the _ maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin number _ of a knot @xmath1 , written @xmath13 , is the maximal @xmath4 over all grid diagrams for @xmath1 ; similarly , the _ maximal self - linking number _",
    "@xmath14 is the maximal @xmath5 over all grid diagrams for @xmath1 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath15 for all @xmath1 , while it is an important classical result of bennequin @xcite that @xmath16 for any @xmath1 . calculating @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "is of natural interest to knot theorists , particularly since each provides a lower bound for various topological knot invariants , including the slice genus @xmath19 @xcite and the concordance invariants @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "there is a fundamental relation between arc index and the maximal thurston ",
    "bennequin numbers of a knot @xmath1 and its mirror @xmath22 , first described by matsuda in @xcite : @xmath23 the proof of this inequality is short and we recall it here . consider a grid diagram for @xmath1 with arc number @xmath3 .",
    "this diagram produces a legendrian knot of topological type @xmath1 , as described above , as well as a legendrian knot of type @xmath22 , by rotating the diagram slightly less than @xmath24 clockwise , changing every crossing , and smoothing the corners .",
    "then it is easy to see that the thurston ",
    "bennequin numbers of these two legendrian knots sum to @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : arc ] ) leads to an approach to calculate arc index and maximal thurston ",

    "find a possibly minimal grid diagram of @xmath1 ; 2 .",
    "find upper bounds for @xmath26 and @xmath27 individually , or for their sum ; 3 .",
    "see if equality is forced to hold in ( [ eq : arc ] ) .",
    "this approach ( essentially ) has been used to calculate arc index for alternating knots @xcite and knots with up to @xmath28 crossings @xcite . in both cases , the upper bound in step ( b )",
    "is provided by the kauffman polynomial .    in this note",
    ", we apply this approach to knots with at most @xmath0 crossings , using grid diagrams provided by baldwin and gillam @xcite and the khovanov bound for @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the minimum and maximum degrees of a laurent polynomial in the specified variable , let @xmath31 , and let @xmath32 denote the two - variable poincar polynomial for @xmath33 khovanov homology .",

    "the computation of @xmath17 for @xmath45 uses a strengthening of the kauffman bound on @xmath17 derived from work of rutherford @xcite and a subsequent observation of klmn @xcite ; the computation of @xmath17 for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 uses cable links .",

    "* conjecture 3.2 ) has made a conjecture which can be restated as follows to parallel question  [ q1 ] :    does a braid whose closure is a particular knot , with a minimal number of strands ( the braid index ) , necessarily realize the maximal self - linking number for the knot ?",

    "bae and park @xcite proved that ( [ eq : arckauffman ] ) is sharp ( i.e. , equality holds ) for alternating knots , where both sides are equal to the crossing number plus @xmath72 .",
    "because of the behavior of arc index and khovanov homology under connected sum , it suffices to consider prime knots only .",
    "in addition , the result holds for alternating knots @xmath1 ; here @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the crossing number of @xmath1 , and both kauffman and khovanov bounds for @xmath17 are sharp @xcite .",
    "baldwin and gillam @xcite , with the help of the program ` gridlink ` @xcite , have constructed grid diagrams for all nonalternating prime knots with @xmath77 or fewer crossings ; these presentations , which include a few diagrams constructed by the author , are available at ` http://www.math.columbia.edu/~wgillam/hfk ` . for most of these diagrams ,",

    ", we introduce a minor strengthening of the kauffman bound ( [ eq : kauffman ] ) , due to klmn @xcite and based on work of rutherford @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , it does not apply to many small knots .",

    "the improved kauffman bound is only as good as the khovanov bound ( [ eq : kh ] ) ; for @xmath45 , however , it improves on the khovanov bound as well , to yield @xmath102 . for @xmath77-crossing knots , proposition  [ prop : improved ] yields",

    "one can similarly use rutherford s work to obtain an improved homfly - pt bound on @xmath17 , when the leading coefficient of the homfly - pt polynomial does not have all nonnegative coefficients , and a `` mixed '' improved bound when the homfly - pt and kauffman bounds agree and the leading coefficient of their difference does not have all nonnegative coefficients .",
    "these seem to be applicable to fewer cases than the improved kauffman bound , however .        as discussed earlier , the case @xmath106 is covered by @xcite ; @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and the khovanov bound is sharp for the former but not for the latter . for @xmath45 ,",
    "proposition  [ prop : improved ] gives @xmath102 , while both kauffman and khovanov bounds give @xmath109 ; since @xmath110 by nutt s table @xcite , these bounds for @xmath111 and @xmath112 are sharp .",

    "there are several knots with @xmath0 or fewer crossings for which all of the known general upper bounds on @xmath17 or @xmath18 fail to be sharp : @xmath113 for @xmath17 , @xmath114 for @xmath18 .",
    "what can one do in these cases ?",
    "one case for @xmath17 , @xmath115 , is the @xmath116 torus knot , and the classification of legendrian torus knots due to etnyre and honda @xcite shows that @xmath117 ; the best general upper bound gives @xmath118 .",

    "we combine the khovanov bound for @xmath158 with proposition  [ prop : cable ] .",
    "for instance , the khovanov bound yields @xmath159 , which with proposition  [ prop : cable ] implies that @xmath160 .",
    "the khovanov bound also shows directly that @xmath161 ; from proposition  [ prop : arckh ] and ( [ eq : arc ] ) , we conclude that @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "similarly , the khovanov bound gives @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , and these bounds produce the values of @xmath17 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 given in proposition  [ prop : tb ] .",
    "we remark that these doubles are links with @xmath169 crossings , and computing their khovanov homology is not altogether trivial .",
    "the particular framings of the doubles were chosen to try to minimize crossings , and each khovanov homology was computed using the program ` javakh ` , written by jeremy green , within ` knottheory ` @xcite .",

    "the usual homfly - pt bound also implies that @xmath184 .",
    "since @xmath185 and @xmath186 , equality holds everywhere .",
    "second , in the situations where the general upper bounds for @xmath26 and @xmath62 ( kauffman , khovanov , homfly - pt ) fail to be sharp , it seems that one can often apply these bounds to the double or perhaps general @xmath142-cable of @xmath1 to deduce a sharp bound for @xmath26 and @xmath62 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : cable ] has a straightforward analogue for @xmath142-component cables of @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath187 denotes the @xmath178-framed @xmath142-component cable of @xmath1 , then @xmath188 it seems at least within the realm of possibility that @xmath189 , and that the homfly - pt bound for @xmath190 might in general give a sharp bound for @xmath62 for _ all _ @xmath1 . a similar but slightly more complicated statement could hold for @xmath17 .",
    "thus there might be a way to calculate @xmath17 and @xmath18 for all knots , by applying the general upper bounds to cables .",
    "we note , however , that calculating these upper bounds for cables is generally quite computationally intensive and may be infeasible for `` medium - sized '' knots of , say , @xmath77 crossings or more .",
