    "ion - atom collisions have been an attractive subject and are of considerable interest in atomic physics due to both their importance in fundamental physics and their application in many fields , such as laboratory and astrophysical plasmas @xcite , heavy ion inertial fusion @xcite , radiation physics , collisional and radioactive processes in the earth s upper atmosphere @xcite and many other technological areas . in recent decades",
    ", ion - atom collisions have been studied in detail experimentally as well as theoretically from low to relativistic collision energies ( see , for example , refs .",
    "there has been an increased need the evaluation of ion - atom cross sections of different processes for many accelerator applications shevelko .",
    "for example , a beam interaction with the remaining background gas and gas desorbed from walls limits the intensity of bunches at the rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) @xcite and a pressure rise from ion losses at the low - energy antiproton ring brought concerns for the lhc ( large hadron collider ) @xcite .    at moderate energies , collisions of closed - shell ions with closed - shell atoms for various inelastic channels such as the ionization , charge - exchange , stripping , and excitation",
    "are well understood .",
    "however , the absolute cross section information of these inelastic processes are of interest - in particular , the energy dependence of collisions of k@xmath7 ions with he atoms because the excitation probabilities in these collisions ( with some exceptions ) are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than in symmetric and quasisymmetric systems @xcite .",
    "another remarkable feature of inelastic collisions of these closed - shell particles is that the excitation into a doubly excited state occurs with a high probability .",
    "therefore , an accurate determination of the structure of different inelastic cross sections for these collisions is important to understand the mechanisms for inelastic transitions in the outer and , in some cases , inner shells of colliding atomic particles . in order to discuss quantitatively the excitation mechanism one has to evaluate the parameters of existing theories and explore the contributions of separate inelastic channels for the investigated processes by using experimental measurements .    despite many studies of k@xmath0he collisions which have been carried out by various methods @xcite , available data for the absolute cross sections of the above mentioned processes are contradictory @xcite and , in some cases , unreliable @xcite .",
    "charge exchange cross sections for k@xmath0ar , k@xmath0kr , k@xmath0xe and k@xmath8he systems were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite using the detection of fast neutral particles within a definite interval of scattering angles .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the restriction on the interval for collision angles in ref .",
    "@xcite underestimated the measured charge exchange cross sections by a factor of ten for the k@xmath0ar , kr , xe collision pairs over the entire energy range considered .",
    "the charge exchange cross sections reported in ref .",
    "@xcite might also have been underestimated for k@xmath7 - he collisions .",
    "hence , it was necessary to carry out measurements of the charge - exchange cross sections for k@xmath0he collisions in a wider and more complete interval of scattering angles using a method that is free of this deficiency .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the absolute value of the cross section for excitation processes , occurring in the case when the mass of the incident ion is less than of target particle ( na@xmath0ar ) was reported .",
    "the results of the measurements of the excitation function in arbitrary units for na@xmath8he and k@xmath0he collision pairs are presented in refs .",
    "matveev , matveev2 .",
    "the lack of absolute excitation cross sections for the asymmetric k@xmath0he system motivated the present detailed investigation of the primary mechanisms for this collision process .    in order to make use of the measured cross section for electron production ,",
    "it is necessary to know absolute ionization cross sections for the target atoms and absolute stripping cross sections for the incident ions . since there are no previous measurements of the stripping cross section for k@xmath9he collisions , it is imperative to measure this cross section .",
    "as is known , the basic mechanism responsible for the process of ionization in atomic collisions is a diabatic orbital super promotion into the continuum .",
    "proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this mechanism was further developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . advantages and limitations of these studies are assessed for colliding systems with one active  electron , e.g. h@xmath0h and he@xmath10h .",
    "it is important to extend the theory to ionization processes in collisions of many ",
    "electron atomic systems .",
    "experimental methods @xcite that are used so far to study this mechanism are based on the measurement of continuous parts of the energy spectra of ejected electrons .",
    "more detailed information for the ejected electrons at different impact parameters can be obtained using coincidence techniques .",
    "one of the objectives of this work is to show that in many cases the information extracted from complicated coincidence experiments can also be obtained using a simple method , namely by measuring the energy loss spectra of incident particles .",
    "such spectra can be measured over a wide range of scattering angles and energy losses , for which the problems of collection of low energy electrons do not arise .",
    "below , we report absolute total cross sections for charge exchange processes , ionization , and stripping processes that result in the production of free electrons , as well as the excitation of both the projectile and target particles and energy loss spectra in collisions of k@xmath7 ions with he atoms .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "exper we introduce our unique experimental setup that includes three collision chambers and present the experimental techniques and procedures used to measure the absolute total cross sections for the excitation , charge exchange , ionization , and stripping processes .",
    "results of measurements and discussion of mechanisms for different processes occurring in k@xmath0he collisions are given in sec .",
    "[ results ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we summarize our studies and present the conclusions .",
    "a schematic view of the experimental setup is shown in fig",
    ". 1 . a beam of k@xmath11 ions from a surface ",
    "ionization ion source is accelerated and focused by an ion - optics system , which includes quadruple lenses and collimating slits .",
    "after the beam passes through a magnetic mass spectrometer , it enters the first collision chamber containing he gas for measurements of excitation processes in k@xmath0he collisions .",
    "our setup is designed so that when the beam of k@xmath7 ions passes through the second collision chamber measurements of the charge exchange , ionization and stripping processes occur .",
    "the energy loss spectrum is obtained by a collision spectroscopy method when k@xmath7 ions collide with target he atoms in the third collision chamber .",
    "the pressure in each collision chamber when there is no he target gas is kept below 10@xmath12 torr and the typical pressure under operation is 10@xmath13 torr .",
    "the measurements are performed under a single - collision conditions .",
    "the current of primary ions in the collision chamber is @xmath14=0.01 - 0.1 @xmath15a .",
    "the uniqueness of our experimental approach is that the quality of the beam as well as the experimental conditions for all processes under investigation always remain identical .",
    "moreover , the experimental techniques include a condenser plate method , angle- and energy - dependent collection of product ions , energy - loss and optical spectroscopy under the same `` umbrella '' .",
    "the measurement procedures have been discussed in some detail previously @xcite , therefore the description of the present measurements can be kept comparatively short .",
    "the measurements of the excitation processes in k@xmath0he collision were performed when the beam of k@xmath7 ions passed through the first collision chamber .",
    "cross sections for the excitation processes were measured by the optical spectroscopy method @xcite .",
    "the radiation emitted in the first collision chamber was observed at an angle of 90@xmath16 with respect to the direction of the primary ion beam .",
    "the spectral analysis of this radiation was performed in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) as well as visible spectral regions .",
    "an electron multiplier was used to detect the intensity of the radiation .",
    "particular attention was devoted to the reliable determination and control of the relative and absolute spectral sensitivity of the light - recording system .",
    "this was done by measuring the signal due to the emission of molecular bands and atomic lines excited by electrons in collisions with h@xmath17 , n@xmath17 , o@xmath17 and ar . for this , an electron gun was placed directly in front of the entrance slit of the collision chamber . the relative spectral sensitivity , and the values of the absolute cross sections ,",
    "were obtained by comparing the cross sections for the same lines and molecular bands reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the excitation cross sections for the k @xmath8he system are estimated to be 20% and the uncertainty of the relative measurements does not exceed 5% .",
    "when the k@xmath7 beam enters the second collision chamber filled with the target gas , the measurements for the charge exchange and ionization processes occur .",
    "the charge exchange and ionization cross sections were measured by a refined version of the capacitor method @xcite . in an earlier paper @xcite the measurements",
    "were performed by the standard transfer electric field method .",
    "the customary procedure is to use one of the central electrodes as the measurement electrode .",
    "we consider that such approach is the reason for significant errors in measurements ogurtsov because scattered k@xmath7 ions may strike the electrodes used for measurements .",
    "this effect becomes more evident especially for low energy collisions . to avoid this deficiency we accordingly used a refined version of the transfer electric field method in which the effect of scattering on the measured results is substantially reduced by shifting from the central electrode ( standard method ) to the first electrode ( towards beam entrance side ) . due to fringing effects at the edges of this electrode",
    "a system of auxiliary electrodes between the first electrode and the entrance slit was installed .",
    "these auxiliary electrodes create a uniform potential near the first electrode .",
    "the first electrode , the auxiliary electrodes , and the entrance slit are all positioned as close together as possible .",
    "this close arrangement limits the scattering region on the beam  entrance side .",
    "thus , according to our estimation , taking into account the geometry of our facilities , only those ions which are scattered through angles greater than 70@xmath16 can reach the electrodes .",
    "the primary ions are detected by the faraday cup .",
    "collision particles ( secondary positive ions and free electrons ) are detected by a collector .",
    "the collector consists of two rows of plate electrodes that run parallel to the primary ion beam . a uniform transverse electric field , responsible for the extraction and collection of collision particles , is created by the potentials applied to the grids .",
    "this method yields direct measurements of the cross sections @xmath18 for the production of singly positively charged ions and @xmath19 for electrons as the primary beam passes through the gas under study .",
    "these measured quantities are related in an obvious way to the capture cross section @xmath20 and the apparent ionization cross section @xmath21 , and are determined as    @xmath22    in @xmath23 is the cross section stripping of the incident ion .",
    "the cross section @xmath21 is always larger than the cross section for stripping @xmath24 it should be mentioned that if the cross sections for multiple ionization and ionization with capture are small then @xmath25 .    the uncertainty in the measurements of the absolute values of the cross sections @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 is estimated to be 15% over the entire energy interval studied .",
    "this is determined primarily by the uncertainty in the measurement of target gas pressure in the collision chamber .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of the ionization cross section @xmath26 is estimated to be @xmath27 over the entire energy range . the larger value in comparison with that for the measurement of the cross section",
    "@xmath19 is a consequence of the presence of an additional error in the measurements of @xmath21 due to stripping of k@xmath7 ions . at k@xmath7 energies less than 2.0",
    "kev the cross section @xmath18 is significantly larger than @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , the error in the determination of the capture cross section @xmath20 in this energy region is determined primarily by the error in the measurement of @xmath28 .",
    "with increasing k@xmath7 energy the cross sections @xmath18 and @xmath29 become more nearly equal . as a result the error in the determination of @xmath20 increases . at a k@xmath7 energy of 5 kev",
    "it is estimated to be 25% .",
    "the stripping cross sections were measured in an independent experiment . a beam of k@xmath7 ions from a surface - ionization ion source after acceleration and focusing passes through the second collision chamber .",
    "it is then analyzed for the charge composition by an additional 90@xmath16 magnetic mass spectrometer ( not shown in fig.1 ) .",
    "a set of slits that were located in front of the detector enable the profile of the projectile beam to be to scanned in detail .",
    "the ratio of the number of doubly charged ions , produced as a result of stripping , to the incident ion beam , k@xmath30k@xmath31 is determined from the areas under the corresponding lines in the mass spectrum . since inelastic processes , apparently including stripping , may be accompanied by the scattering of particles through comparatively large angles in collisions between alkali metal ions and inert gas atoms afrosimov1 , afrosimov2 , afrosimov3 , special measures were taken to arrange complete collection of k@xmath32 ions .",
    "the energy loss spectrum was obtained by the collision spectroscopy method @xcite . the primary beam extracted from the ion source",
    "was accelerated to the desired energy before being analyzed according to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the ion s charge and mass , respectively ) .",
    "the analyzed ion beam was then allowed to pass through the third collision chamber by appropriately adjusting the slits prior to entering into a ` box ' type electrostatic analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution of this analyzer is @xmath36=1/500 .",
    "automatic adjustments of analyzer potentials gave the possibility for investigation of energy loss spectra in the energy range of 0  100 ev .",
    "the differential cross section is measured by rotating the analyzer around the center of collisions over an angular range between 0 and 25@xmath16 degrees .",
    "the laboratory angle is determined with respect to the primary ion beam axis with an accuracy of 0.2@xmath37    for the measurements of the charge exchange differential cross section the charge component of scattered primary particles realized in the third collision chamber is separated by the electric field ( see ion charge deflector in fig . 1 ) and neutral particles formed by electron capture collisions are registered by the secondary electron multiplier .",
    "such a tool gives us the possibility to determine total cross sections and compare them with the results obtained in the second collision chamber .",
    "in addition , the measured energy loss spectrum gives detailed information related to the intensity of inelastic processes realized in the first collision chamber ( excitation ) and in the second collision chamber ( charge exchange , ionization and stripping ) .",
    "the collision of a k@xmath7 ion beam with he gas leads mainly to the following processes : charge exchange reaction    @xmath38    when the k atom and he@xmath7 ion products can be in the ground state or in different excited states ; different excitation processes    @xmath39    that include different channels for excitation of the k@xmath7 ion or / and he atom ; stripping of k@xmath7    @xmath40    and ionization of he    @xmath41    as well as excitation of autoionization states    @xmath42    when he@xmath43 is formed in different autoionization states and then decays by emitting an electron .    in figs .",
    "2  4 the measured energy dependences of absolute total cross - sections are presented for charge exchange into the ground and excited states of k@xmath7 , the ionization , stripping and excitation function of potassium atom , ion and target helium atom in k@xmath0 he collisions .",
    "5b @xmath44 5d represent a typical example of the energy loss spectrum for k@xmath9he system . for comparison , in fig .",
    "5a is given the energy loss spectrum for k@xmath0ar collision .",
    "we have also measured the energies of the electrons emitted in the collisions .",
    "it was found that the energy of most liberated electrons is below 10 - 15 ev .    as seen from figs . 2 and 3",
    ", a distinctive feature of most of these inelastic processes is the small magnitude of the cross section .",
    "the excitation functions of the k ii lines at @xmath45 nm and @xmath3 nm are similar ( curve 1 and 5 in fig .",
    "2 ) . the curves did not differ in shape and curve 1 could be obtained from curve 5 by multiplying the ordinate of the last one by a factor of @xmath46 5 .",
    "another feature that is prominent in the ionization , charge exchange and excitation cross sections is the difference in the energy dependences . while the ionization cross section ( fig .",
    "3 ) and excitation function of the k@xmath7 ion ( fig .",
    "2 , curve 5 ) and k atom ( fig . 2 curve 2 ) are small at low energies and increase monotonically with energy up to 5 kev , the total charge exchange cross section has a complex energy dependence and generally decreases with the collision energy up to 5 kev and then increases ( fig .",
    "2 , curve 3 ) .",
    "structural features are also observed in the resonance line for the helium atom ( fig .",
    "2 , curve 4 ) .",
    "distinct features are observed in the energy loss spectra shown in figs .",
    "5 . in the case",
    "for which colliding particles have nearly equal masses ( k@xmath0ar , fig . 5 ( a ) ) the main inelastic process",
    "is realized effectively in the 10 @xmath44 35 ev energy loss interval , while for asymmetric colliding pairs ( k@xmath8he , fig .",
    "5d ) this energy losses are extended up to 60 ev .",
    "the data obtained in this study can be used to draw certain conclusions about the possible reasons for these features in the cross sections and mechanisms for the corresponding processes . to explain these mechanisms we use a schematic correlation diagram of the adiabatic quasimolecular terms for the system of colliding particles .",
    "the diagram was constructed based on barat - lichten rules @xcite and is presented in fig .",
    "these results motivate us to explore the excitation functions for collisions of k@xmath7 ions with helium atoms . the radiation generated in these collisions",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 and it includes : one resonance line of the k atom at @xmath47 nm ( curve 2 ) corresponding to the channel k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50 ) @xmath51k(4s)@xmath49he@xmath7(1s ) of process ( ce ) , two resonance lines of the k@xmath7 ion @xmath52at @xmath45 nm ( curve 1 ) and @xmath3 nm ( curve 5 ) for process ( [ k excited ] ) and one resonance line of the he atom at @xmath53 nm ( curve 4 ) corresponding to different channels of process ( [ k excited ] ) .",

    "the intensity ratio of the k ii @xmath45 nm and @xmath3 lines shown in fig . 2 is 5:1 , indicating that the probability of excitation of the singlet resonance level @xmath4p@xmath5 is greater than that of the triplet level @xmath6p@xmath5 , due to spin conservation .",

    "this results from the overlapping of different excitation channels in different energy ranges . particularly , the analyses of the correlation diagram in fig .",
    "6 leads to the conclusion that at relatively small energies the excitation of he(1s2p ) originate due to the exchange interaction through the intermediate state corresponding to the channel k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50)@xmath51k(4s ) @xmath49he@xmath7(1s ) , while at large energies the excitation of he(1s2p ) may occur due to the @xmath62 transition between terms which correspond to the k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50)@xmath51k@xmath7(4s@xmath57)@xmath49he(1s@xmath63 ) and k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50)@xmath51k@xmath7(3p@xmath48)@xmath61he(1s2p ) channels .      in determining the processes responsible for charge exchange in k@xmath0he collisions",
    ", we compare the total charge exchange cross sections presented in fig . 2 by curve 3 with those corresponding to the decay of resonant levels of the potassium atom presented by curve 2 . taking into account the selection rules and the ratio of oscillator strengths for the transitions , we show that the decay of any of the excitation levels of the potassium atom culminates in about half the cases with a transition of the atom to a resonant state , which then decays . according to our data , the decay cross section of the resonant levels of the potassium atom in k@xmath7- he collisions increases with incident ion energy , reaching about @xmath64 cm@xmath50 at an ion energy of 3 kev and 7@xmath6610@xmath67 @xmath68 at 5 - 7 kev . at low collision energies",
    "these cross sections are less than 1% , and at high collision energies are @xmath69 of the total charge exchange cross sections .",
    "it follows that in these collisions the cross section for the capture of an electron to an excited state of atom through the channels k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50 ) @xmath51 k(4p)@xmath49he@xmath11(1s ) or k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50)@xmath51k(3d)@xmath49he@xmath7(1s ) is less than 10% of the total charge exchange cross section . in other words , the charge exchange process results primarily from capture of an electron to the ground state of the k atom .",
    "the target ions are produced in these processes primarily in the ground state .",
    "processes involving capture accompanied by excitation of the resultant target ion he@xmath7 make a small contribution into the charge exchange cross section , apparently because the energy defect of these processes is of the same order of magnitude as the collision energy ( the total kinetic energy of the particles in the c.m",
    ". system ) @xcite .",
    "the energy defect of these processes is @xmath4661 ev , while the collision energy at an ion energy of 700 ev is only 65 ev in the c.m . system .",
    "we thus can conclude that the charge exchange reaction ( [ ce ] ) is governed primarily by the capture of an electron in the ground state of the potassium atom , accompanied by the formation of a helium ion also in the ground state : k@xmath7(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50 ) @xmath51k(4s ) @xmath49 he@xmath11(1s ) .",

    "correspondingly , there is no significant decrease in the impact parameters at which the pseudocrossing regions are reached .    in the two - channel approximation ,",

    "this behavior of the cross section indicates that at the ion energy of 1.5 kev the charge exchange mechanism is not correlated exclusively with the interaction of the entrance and exit channels , since the interference of these channels with other channels becomes important .",
    "in particular , the decrease of the cross section at ion energies 1.5@xmath445.0 kev can be related to the interference of the exit channel with the channel asymptotically dissociating into to the state k@xmath7(3p@xmath554s@xmath80)@xmath49he(1s@xmath50 ) , as follows from fig .",
    "an interaction of these channels is confirmed by the agreement of the position of the minimum in the energy dependence of the charge exchange cross section with the position of the maximum in the energy dependence of the cross section for the decay of the resonant level of the ion k@xmath7(3p@xmath814s@xmath80 ) , shown in fig .",

    "estimates of the cross section for the direct ionization with these parameters show that at an ion energy of 2.5 kev , the contribution of the direct ionization to the total ionization cross section is less than 0.1% , while at 6.5 kev it is less than 5.5% i.e. , this contribution is insignificant over the entire energy range studied .",
    "the double ionization of the he atom , and capture accompanied by ionization of the he atom evidently make a small contribution to the ionization cross section .",
    "there are two reasons for this : the large energy defect for these processes , 79 and 74.6 ev , respectively , and the absence of pseudocrossings of the corresponding quasimolecular terms with the ground - state term , as follows from the diagram in fig.6 .    as follows from the electron spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resultant intensity of the discrete lines associated with capture to the autoionization states of the k atom and ultimately corresponding to the ionization of the he atom is several times lower than the that of the lines of the k@xmath7 ion corresponding to stripping processes . since the stripping cross section is less than 10% of that for ionization ( see fig .",
    "3 ) we find that the capture to autoionization states of k atoms also plays no important role in the ionization .",
    "consequently , by systematically evaluating the contributions of various inelastic processes to the ionization of the target atoms in k@xmath0he collisions , we find that the ionization may be caused primarily by the decay of quasimolecular autoionization states . these could be expected to be states with two excited electrons ( see the energy loss spectrum in figs . 5c and 5d )",
    ", since such states undergo quasimolecular decay with a high probability , liberating mainly slow electrons with a continuous energy distribution @xcite . both of these circumstances agree with the conclusions which follow from an analysis of the correlation diagram of the system , and they add a few refinements to the ionization mechanism .",
    "it can be seen from the diagram that the ground state of the system goes over in the limit of the united atom into the 3p@xmath483d@xmath50 ( @xmath4d@xmath17 ) singlet state of the sc@xmath7 ion . below this state ,",
    "the sc@xmath7 ion has only three triplet states ( not shown in the diagram ) and one singlet state ( with the configuration 3p@xmath483d4s ) @xcite .",
    "only the term , asymptotically dissociating into k ( 3p@xmath484s ) @xmath49 he@xmath7 , with the appropriate @xmath95 symmetry , crosses the ground state .",
    "note that electron transitions occur primarily between terms of the same multiplicity .",
    "we find that the autoionization results from the filling of primarily terms of @xmath96 and @xmath97 symmetry .",
    "these terms correlate in the limit of separated atoms to the states : k@xmath98(4s)@xmath44he@xmath99(1s2s ) , k@xmath100(4s)@xmath44he@xmath99(1s2p ) , k@xmath101 ( 3p@xmath1023d4s)@xmath44he(1s@xmath50 ) and k@xmath7(3p@xmath48)@xmath44he@xmath43(2p@xmath50 ) ( fig .",
    "all of these terms , as expected , correspond to two - electron excitations of the system . since the ground - state term has the symmetry @xmath95 , the terms are populated as a result of @xmath62 and @xmath103 transitions , associated with the rotation of the internuclear axis along the different nuclear trajectories .      according to our estimates ,",
    "the governing mechanism for the stripping process ( [ striping ] ) is the transition of adiabatic term into the continuum .",
    "the stripping cross section determined by this mechanism was calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ rr ] ) . as it follows from the diagram in fig.6 the 3p electrons of the k@xmath7 ion",
    "are correlated with the 3p electrons of the sc@xmath7 ion .",
    "consequently , in evaluating the cross section we selected @xmath104 , while we took @xmath90 to be the same as for the 3d electrons of sc@xmath7 ion in evaluating the ionization cross section .",
    "the stripping cross section calculated with these parameters is consistent over the entire energy region ( fig .",
    "3 , curve 1 ) with the experimental cross section ( fig .",
    "3 , curve 2 ) to within less than 25% .",
    "although this agreement is fortuitous to some extent , it does support the conclusion that this is the governing mechanism for the stripping : k@xmath7(3p@xmath48)@xmath49he(1s@xmath50)@xmath105k@xmath32(3p@xmath55 ) @xmath49he(1s@xmath50)@xmath106 .      as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the excitation functions of the k atom and k@xmath7 ion for 4p lines are similar , apparently indicating a common mechanism of population . for the interpretation of this result",
    "it is expedient to use the correlation diagram of molecular states of the ( khe)@xmath7 system from fig .",
    "we emphasize that the term corresponding to the k(3d ) state is responsible for both ",
    "the population of the potassium atom and the ion into the 4p state .",
    "the terms corresponding to the excitation of k(4p ) as well as k@xmath7(4p ) do not have immediate crossing points with the entrance term k@xmath7(3p@xmath48)@xmath44he(1s@xmath50 ) .",
    "however , both of these terms may be populated from that corresponding to k ( 3d ) excitation states by means of a double rotational transition @xmath103 between the entrance term and that corresponding to the k(3d)@xmath44he@xmath7(1s ) state .",
    "the excitation state of the term corresponding to k(4p ) may be populated from the term corresponding to the k(3d ) , via the cascade transition , from level 3d to 4p . as for the population of the term k@xmath7(4p ) , because the term k@xmath11(4p)@xmath44he(1s@xmath50 ) and k(3d)@xmath44he@xmath7(1s ) at large internuclear distance are energetically closed ( the energy defect is 0.4 ev ) , the exchange interaction between these states may cause a population of the term corresponding to k@xmath7(4p ) , and hence the identical energy dependences of the cross sections .",
    "the probability of population of the k(3d ) level of the potassium atom itself is very small , due to the small probability of the @xmath107 transition ( see fig .",
    "perhaps this is the reason for the anomalous small excitation cross section of the potassium atom in k(4p ) state and for the k@xmath7(4p ) state .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , curve 2 and fig .",
    "4 , curves 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn from fig .",
    "5 is that the energy loss spectra for both k@xmath0ar and k@xmath0he collisions have a discrete character . the energy loss spectrum for k@xmath0ar  in fig .",
    "5 ( a ) is presented for comparison and is chosen for the fixed energy ( @xmath108 2 kev ) and scattering angle ( @xmath109 = 3.5@xmath16 ) at which the inelastic channels are most populated .",
    "the first peak of this spectrum corresponds to the elastic scattering of k@xmath7 ions , while the second one corresponds to the single electron excitation of the argon atom to ( 4s ) , ( 4p ) and ( 3d ) states with energy losses of @xmath110 ev .",
    "the third one corresponds to the excitation of k@xmath7 ions into the ( 4s ) and ( 3d ) states with energy losses @xmath111 ev , and the fourth one corresponds to the single and double autoionization states of ar with energy losses @xmath112 ev .",
    "the energy loss spectrum for k@xmath0 he colliding pairs is given at @xmath113 kev and for the various scattering angles of k@xmath7 ions : @xmath114 , fig .",
    "5 ( b ) ; @xmath115 , fig . 5 ( c ) ; @xmath116 , fig . 5 ( d ) respectively .",
    "this allows us to observe the dynamics of inelastic channels .",
    "let us analyze the energy loss spectrum for the k@xmath0@xmath113@xmath116 scattering angle shown in fig . 5 ( d ) .",
    "the first maximum at zero energy loss is attributed to the elastic scattering of k@xmath7 ions .",
    "the second maximum at @xmath117 ev is ascribed to the excitation of the potassium ion into the ( 4s@xmath118 ) states and to the direct excitation of the helium atom into ( 2p ) state . with low probability of excitation ionization and stripping , with energy losses @xmath119 ev and @xmath120 ev",
    ", respectively , are favored .",
    "rather higher excitation probabilities are observed at the energy loss @xmath121 ev and they are ascribed to the two electron excitation of the helium atom into ( 2s@xmath122 and ( 2p@xmath50 ) states hicks , kita2 .    the remarkable feature of the spectrum from figs .",
    "5 ( b)@xmath445 ( d ) is the rapid decrease of the elastic channel intensity with scattering angle .",
    "this fact indicates the increasing importance of inelastic channels . in spite of the fact that the energy loss spectrum has been measured up to 60 ev",
    ", a significant elastic peak was observed only at 1@xmath16 scattering angle . with the increase of scattering angle from 1@xmath16 to 3.5@xmath123 the excitation of the inelastic channel ( one and two electron excitation of helium atom and excitation of potassium ion ) becomes predominant .",
    "we have also observed these specific features of the energy loss spectrum for other energies of the incident ions .",
    "this allows us to conclude that for k@xmath0he collisions in this energy range , the main inelastic channel is the excitation of the k@xmath11 ion into the ( 4s@xmath57 ) state .",
    "this result was also confirmed from our excitation function given in fig.2 , curve 1 .",
    "indeed , as seen from this figure , the intensities of excited k@xmath7(4s@xmath124 ) lines are more than one order higher than for the rest of the inelastic channels considered here .",
    "using refined experimental methods that include a condenser plate method , angle- and energy - dependent collection of product ions , energy - loss and optical spectroscopy under the same `` umbrella '' and a well checked calibration procedure of the light recording system , we have measured the absolute values of the charge exchange , ionization , stripping and excitation cross sections .",
    "the correlation diagram of the ( khe)@xmath7 system has been employed to discuss the mechanisms for these processes in the k@xmath7 ion energy range @xmath125 kev .",
    "charge exchange in k@xmath0he collisions mostly occurs through the channel k@xmath11(3p@xmath48 ) @xmath49 he(1s@xmath50 ) @xmath51 k(4s)@xmath49he@xmath7(1s ) resulting from the capture of the electron to the ground state of the atom in regions of pseudocrossings of the potential curves of @xmath95 symmetry .",
    "the primary ionization mechanism in k@xmath0he collisions is the filling , as a result of @xmath62 and @xmath103 transitions , of quasimolecular autoionization terms and their decay in the region of the transition into the continuum ( in the stage in which a quasimolecule exists ) .",
    "stripping in k@xmath0he collisions occurs via a mechanism involving a transition of adiabatic term into the continuum in the region of a non adiabatic interaction of molecular orbitals with orbital angular moments which are identical in the limit of the united atom .    a common mechanism of the populations , as well as the small values of excitation cross sections for the potassium ion and atom into 4p states are explained .",
    "the usage of the collision spectroscopy method has permitted us to observe exceptionally highly excited states of helium atom in the energy loss spectrum ."
