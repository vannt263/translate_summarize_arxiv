    "the quest for the origin of cosmic rays is one of the most fundamental problems in astroparticle physics @xcite . since the discovery of these highly energetic particles more than a century ago ,",
    "numerous measurements of several of their properties have been made , using sophisticated instruments ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , the exact nature of their sources still remains an open question .",
    "the search is mainly hindered due to the fact that cosmic rays , being charged particles , are scattered or deflected by the galactic and inter - galactic magnetic fields during their propagation to the earth , making it extremely difficult to reconstruct the direction of their sources",
    ". nevertheless , observed cosmic - ray properties like the energy spectrum and composition have been used to understand and characterize the properties of the sources such as their galactic or extragalactic nature , the cosmic - ray production spectrum and the power injected into cosmic rays ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "lofar , the low frequency array , is an astronomical radio telescope @xcite .",
    "it has been designed to measure the properties of cosmic rays above @xmath2  ev by detecting radio emission from extensive air showers in the frequency range of @xmath3  mhz @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of the lofar key science project cosmic rays is to provide an accurate measurement of the mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy range between @xmath2 and @xmath4  ev , a region where the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays is expected .",
    "this is being carried out by measuring the depth of the shower maximum ( @xmath5 ) , using a technique based on the reconstruction of the two - dimensional radio intensity profile on the ground @xcite .",
    "another focus of the lofar cosmic - ray measurements is to understand the nature and production mechanisms of the radio emission from air showers .",
    "this is done by measuring various properties of the radio signals in great detail such as their polarization properties , the radio wave front and relativistic time compression effects on the emission profile @xcite .    in order to assist the radio measurement of air showers with lofar ,",
    "we have built a particle detector array lora ( lofar radboud air shower array ) in the center of lofar @xcite .",
    "its main objectives are to trigger the read - out of the lofar radio antennas to register radio signals from air showers , and to provide basic air shower parameters such as the position of the shower axis as well as the energy and the arrival direction of the incoming cosmic - ray .",
    "these parameters are used to cross - check the reconstruction of air shower properties , based on the measured radio signals . currently , given the lack of an absolute calibration of the radio signals , the cosmic - ray energy is estimated through the reconstruction of the particle data .",
    "therefore , an accurate energy reconstruction with lora is essential for a proper understanding of the air showers measured with lofar .    in this article",
    ", we describe in detail the various steps of the energy reconstruction and present the cosmic - ray energy spectrum above @xmath2  ev as measured with lora .",

    "the array is subdivided into @xmath8 units , each comprising of 4 detectors .",
    "the detectors have a spacing between @xmath9  m , and have been designed to measure cosmic rays with energies above @xmath2  ev .",
    "the array is co - located with six lofar stations high - band antennas , operating in the frequency range of @xmath10 mhz and @xmath11 mhz respectively . ] .",
    "the layout of the array is shown in figure [ fig : lora - array ] .",
    "the data acquisition in each unit is controlled locally .",
    "a local trigger condition of 3 out of 4 detectors is set for each unit , and an event is accepted for a read - out of the full array when at least one unit has been triggered .",
    "a high - level trigger for the lofar radio antennas is formed when at least 13 out of the 20 detectors have measured a signal above threshold .",
    "more technical details can be found in ref .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] data collected with the lora array since its first science operation in june 2011 until october 2014 are used . only data collected in periods with all 20 detectors in operation will be considered .",
    "this amounts to a total of @xmath12 days of data . for the analysis ,",
    "only showers that trigger a minimum of @xmath8 detectors will be considered , which corresponds to a total of @xmath13 air showers .    for every measured shower ,",
    "the signal arrival time and the energy deposit in each detector are recorded .",
    "the relative signal arrival times between the detectors are used to reconstruct the arrival direction of the primary cosmic ray .",
    "the energy deposits are used to reconstruct the position of the shower axis and the shower size ( the effective number of charged particles at the ground ) .",
    "the latter is determined in terms of the number of vertical equivalent charged particles , which may also include converted photons in addition to the dominant charged particles - electrons and muons . the shower axis position and the shower size",
    "are determined simultaneously by fitting a lateral density distribution function to the measured two - dimensional distribution of particle densities , projected into the shower plane . the particle density in each detector",
    "is obtained by first dividing the track - length - corrected factor where @xmath14 is the zenith angle of the reconstructed arrival direction of the primary cosmic ray . ]",
    "energy deposition by the energy deposition of a single particle obtained from calibration , and then by further dividing by the projected area of the detector in the shower plane .",
    "the lateral density distribution of an air shower is generally described by the nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) function which is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the particle density in the shower plane at a radial distance @xmath17 from the shower axis , @xmath18 is the shower size , @xmath19 is shower age or lateral shape parameter and @xmath20 is the radius parameter which is basically a measure of the lateral spread of the shower",
    ". the function @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 in the case of lora , the value of @xmath20 is determined from the fit along with @xmath18 and the position of the shower axis .",

    "simultaneous fitting of both @xmath20 and @xmath19 results in fits of poorer quality .",
    "simulation studies have shown that keeping @xmath19 constant gives better results than keeping @xmath20 constant @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure is repeated three times with the output of each fit taken as starting values for the next iteration .",
    "details about the minimization procedure and the choice of starting values , as well as the reconstruction of the arrival direction of the primary particle are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all showers that trigger at least @xmath8 detectors with a minimum of @xmath24  particle  m@xmath25 are allowed to pass through the reconstruction algorithm , and their shower parameters are calculated .",
    "furthermore , only showers whose reconstructed position of the shower axis falls within @xmath26  m from the center of the array are selected .",
    "the normalized distribution of @xmath20 values for the selected showers with reconstructed sizes @xmath27 and reconstructed zenith angles in the range of @xmath28 are shown in figure [ average - lateral ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the inset shows a closer view of the distribution around the maximum value between @xmath29 and @xmath30  m , and a gaussian fit to the distribution .",
    "the fit gives a peak value of @xmath31  m. figure [ average - lateral ] ( right panel ) shows the averaged lateral distributions of the measured showers for different reconstructed size bins in the range of @xmath32 for zenith angle between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the distributions include events that passed through the same selection cuts applied in the left panel of figure [ average - lateral ] and have @xmath20 values in the range of @xmath35  m. the averaged distributions are obtained by stacking together the lateral distributions of all individual showers contained in each size bin .",
    "the lines in the plot represent the fits to the data using ( [ eq : lateral - density ] ) . to avoid clumsiness of the plots",
    ", uncertainties are shown only for the size bins of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , all the respective uncertainties are taken into account in the fitting procedure .",
    "the values of @xmath20 obtained from the fits are in the range of @xmath38  m.    the shower size gives a good measure of the energy of the primary cosmic - ray particle , initiating the air shower .",
    "therefore , the shower size distribution should reflect the energy distribution of the cosmic rays at size values where the primary energy is above the detector threshold .",
    "figure [ size - distribution ] shows the distribution of reconstructed shower sizes for all the measured showers that passed through the various trigger and quality cuts applied in the analysis .",
    "this corresponds to a total of @xmath39 air showers .",
    "the distribution shows a steep rise as @xmath18 increases which is due to the sharp increase in the detector acceptance ( see section [ sec : simulation ] ) as function of the primary energy . after reaching a maximum",
    ", the distribution falls off steeply which is due to the power - law behavior of the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "the peak of the total distribution gives the shower size threshold of the detector array .",
    "fitting a gaussian function around the peak gives a value of @xmath40 .",
    "also shown in figure [ size - distribution ] are the reconstructed size distributions for four zenith angle bins : @xmath28 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",

    "the measured shower size can be converted into the energy of the primary particle using a conversion relation obtained from simulations .",
    "simulated showers are stored in a two dimensional log - log histogram in reconstructed size and true energy .",
    "such a histogram is shown in figure [ size - energy - plot ] for showers induced by protons ( left panel ) and iron nuclei ( right panel ) for the zenith angle range of @xmath28 .",
    "the color profile represents the weight of the distribution .",
    "the distribution is broader for proton showers , which is mainly due to the large intrinsic fluctuations of proton showers . from simulations ,",
    "the fluctuations in the true shower size for proton showers within the @xmath28 zenith angle bin are found to be @xmath44 while the uncertainty due to the reconstruction is in the range of @xmath45 for the energy region of our interest .",
    "for iron induced showers , the intrinsic size fluctuation is only @xmath46 , while the reconstruction accuracy remains almost the same as that of the proton induced showers .",
    "another major difference is that for the same reconstructed shower size , iron showers have higher energies than the protons .",
    "this is related to the shallower penetration depth of iron induced showers in the atmosphere , which leads to an increased attenuation of electrons before they can reach the ground .",
    "the distributions in figure [ size - energy - plot ] are binned in @xmath18 , taking a logarithmic bin size of @xmath47 , and profile plots of the true energy as function of @xmath18 are generated .",
    "the profile plots are represented by the solid points in figure [ size - energy - plot ] .",
    "each point in the plots represents the peak of the energy distribution for each size bin , and the uncertainty on each point corresponds to the spread of the energy distribution which is described in detail in the following .",
    "figure [ energy - dis ] shows the energy distribution for the bin slice of @xmath48 for both , showers induced by protons ( left panel ) and iron nuclei ( right panel ) .",
    "the distribution for protons is not symmetric about its mean and is found to be more extended to lower energies .",
    "this can be understood as more contamination from low - energy showers in a given size bin than from higher energies which is caused by the larger intrinsic fluctuations of low - energy showers .",
    "the level of contamination depends on the assumed slope of the primary cosmic - ray spectrum in the simulation .",
    "the peaks of the distributions are obtained by fitting with a skewed gaussian function . the skewed gaussian distribution function used in the present analysis",
    "is given by , @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the normalisation constant , @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent measures of the spread and the position of the distribution respectively , and @xmath54 is the skewness parameter of the distribution function .         the lines in figure [ energy - dis ] represent the fitted functions .",
    "the important fit parameters @xmath55 are also shown .",
    "for the distribution of iron - induced showers , it can be noticed that the value of @xmath54 is close to zero , indicating that the distribution closely resembles a normal gaussian distribution .",
    "the uncertainties in the profile plots shown in figure [ size - energy - plot ] are obtained by taking the difference between the energies corresponding to the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and the peak energy of the energy distribution for each size bin .",
    "the uncertainties obtained are asymmetric for the proton distribution while for iron induced showers , they are almost symmetric .",
    "the @xmath18 values of the profile plots shown in figure [ size - energy - plot ] are calculated as the weighted mean of the size distribution within each size bin .",
    "these size values are found to be slightly smaller than the bin centers .    to obtain the size - energy relation , each profile plot",
    "is fitted using the following function , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the true energy , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the fit parameters .",
    "the fit is performed only in the size region where a reliable fit of the true energy distribution , as shown in figure [ energy - dis ] , could be performed .",
    "this corresponds to a size region of @xmath60 for both the type of particles .",
    "the profile plots as well as the fitted functions for all the zenith angle ranges are shown in figure [ size - energy - all - angles ] for protons ( left panel ) and iron nuclei ( right panel ) .    from these figures",
    ", it can be noticed that for the same shower size , primary energies at larger zenith angles are larger than at smaller angles . in other words , it requires a higher energy at larger zenith angles to generate the same number of particles on the ground as at lower zenith angles .",
    "this is due to higher attenuation of air shower particles at larger zenith angles as the showers pass through a longer column depth of air in the atmosphere .",
    "the values of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 parameters obtained from the fits for the four zenith angle ranges are listed in table [ fit - parameters ] . using these values , for any simulated or measured shower for which the reconstructed arrival direction and the reconstructed size are known",
    ", the primary cosmic - ray energy can be reconstructed using the relation @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the reconstructed energy .",
    "in this section , we present details about the accuracy of the reconstructed energies and the uncertainties that have to be considered for the reconstruction of the cosmic - ray intensity .",
    "the accuracy depends on the variation of the true shower size caused by the intrinsic shower - to - shower fluctuations in the atmosphere and also on the accuracy in the reconstruction of the shower size .      for each size bin in the @xmath63 profile plot , reconstructed energies @xmath64",
    "are obtained for every simulated shower , and a distribution of the differences between the true energies and the reconstructed energies @xmath65 is generated .",
    "the distribution obtained is similar to the one shown in figure [ energy - dis ] , except for a shift in the peak position to the left by an interval equal to the value of the reconstructed energy .",
    "the peak position and the spread of these distributions are obtained correspondingly .",
    "the peak represents the systematic uncertainty due to energy calibration , while the spread corresponds to the energy resolution .",
    "their values expressed as fraction of the reconstructed energies are shown in figure [ energy - accu ] as function of the shower size for the zenith angle range of @xmath66 .",
    "the resolution is in the range of @xmath67 for proton induced showers and @xmath68 for showers induced by iron nuclei .",
    "the systematics are within 12% for protons and within 8% for iron nuclei . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the uncertainty in energy for protons increases to the range of @xmath70 in resolution and to @xmath71 in systematics . for iron nuclei ,",
    "the uncertainty remains almost the same up to @xmath72 .",

    "the filled points represent the energy resolution and the the empty points are the systematic uncertainties resulting from the energy calibration .",
    "see section [ energy - resolution ] for details . ]      the systematic uncertainty in energy shown in figure [ energy - accu ] is associated with the energy calibration performed using equation [ eq : energy - calibration ] .",
    "other main sources of systematic uncertainty in energy include the assumed slope of the primary cosmic - ray spectrum in the corsika simulation , the vem peak obtained from the detector simulation and the hadronic interaction models .",
    "thus , the calibration parameters , listed in table [ fit - parameters ] , also depend on the choice of simulation parameters .",
    "a part of the systematic uncertainties are obtained by changing the values of the slope and the vem peak in the simulations within reasonable limits , and by comparing the newly reconstructed energies with the energies obtained using the fixed parameters given in table [ fit - parameters ] . for the slope of the energy spectrum ,",
    "simulated showers with an original slope @xmath73 are weighted to generate distributions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "then , following the same procedure as described in section [ sec : energy - calibration ] , energy calibrations are performed separately for the two different slopes and calibration parameters are obtained .",
    "the differences between the energies reconstructed with the new parameters and the ones reconstructed using the parameters given in table [ fit - parameters ] gives the systematic uncertainty due to the spectral slope .",
    "the uncertainties are found to be within @xmath76 for protons and within @xmath77 for iron nuclei .    from the detector simulation",
    ", it has been observed that adding noise to the deposited energy in the detector at the level of @xmath24  mev ( see section [ detector - simulation ] ) leads to around @xmath78 positive shift in the value of the most probable energy deposition @xmath79 in the detector for vertical incident muons .",
    "the 10% increase in @xmath79 will lead to a decrease in the shower size and subsequently to an increase in the reconstructed energy by @xmath80 .",
    "the average systematic shift in the reconstructed energy due to this uncertainty in vem calibration is obtained to be @xmath81 for showers induced by either protons or iron nuclei .",

    "the total systematic for protons increases slightly , reaching @xmath84 at @xmath69 , while for iron nuclei , the uncertainty remains almost unchanged .          any systematic uncertainty in energy results in a systematic shift in the reconstructed cosmic - ray flux intensity .",
    "to estimate the systematic uncertainty in intensity due to the energy calibration , the reconstructed energies are determined using equation [ eq : energy - calibration ] for all simulated showers with @xmath85 that pass through all selection and quality cuts as listed in table  [ quality - cut ] .",
    "the distribution of the reconstructed energies is compared to the distribution of the true energies , and the systematic uncertainty in intensity is calculated as @xmath86 for each energy bin , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 represent the number of showers per bin in the true and reconstructed energy distributions respectively .         for the systematic effect due to the uncertainties in the spectral slope and the vem calibration , the energy calibration determined in their respective cases",

    "the thick solid line represents the systematic uncertainty due to the energy calibration , the blue band represents the contribution due to the spectral slope , the dashed line is the vem contribution , and the shaded - striped region represents the total systematic uncertainty . for energies above @xmath89 ,",

    "<S> the energy reconstruction of extensive air showers measured with the lofar radboud air shower array ( lora ) is presented in detail . </S>",
    "<S> lora is a particle detector array located in the center of the lofar radio telescope in the netherlands . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to provide an accurate and independent energy measurement for the air showers measured through their radio signal with the lofar antennas . </S>",
    "<S> the energy reconstruction is performed using a parameterized relation between the measured shower size and the cosmic - ray energy obtained from air shower simulations . in order to illustrate the capabilities of lora , </S>",
    "<S> the all - particle cosmic - ray energy spectrum has been reconstructed , assuming that cosmic rays are composed only of protons or iron nuclei in the energy range between @xmath0 and @xmath1  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compatible with literature values and a changing mass composition in the transition region from a galactic to an extragalactic origin of cosmic rays .    cosmic rays , air showers , energy spectrum , lora </S>"
