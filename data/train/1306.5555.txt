    "long polymers are very likely to be found in the configuration of knots or links .",
    "the topological properties of polymers with closed conformations play indeed an important role in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "for that reason , they are being actively investigated @xcite .",
    "a particularly challenging problem is that of the statistical mechanics of polymer knots . up to now",
    ", a satisfactory analytical model exists only in the case of two polymer rings linked together @xcite , but there is no analogous model for a knot despite many attempts , see for instance @xcite for a review on this subject .",
    "moreover , the scaling laws of the most important observables of polymer knots , like for instance the gyration radius , are still a subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty behind the treatment of polymer knots , as well as polymer links , is to distinguish the wealth of different topological configurations of such systems .",
    "this problem arises in analytical models because it is necessary to impose topological constraints in order to avoid that the statistical fluctuations affect the initial topological state .",
    "this is a physical requirement , dictated by the fact that , once a polymer knot or link has been formed , its topological state can not be modified without breaking the covalent bonds holding together the monomers .",
    "thus , unwanted changes of the topological configuration must be detected and rejected . in numerical simulations , instead , a widely used way to generate polymer knots or links is to consider self avoiding walks ( saw s ) that , at a certain point , intersect themselves forming closed conformations @xcite . the problem in this case is to sort out the topological configurations that are of interest from all the other configurations produced within this approach .",
    "this process of generating knot and links is not very efficient for our purposes , because the probability of formation of knots or links of a given type from saw s is very low , see for instance ref .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to start from a polymer ring with a seed trajectory that is out of equilibrium , but already in the desired topological configuration .",
    "later , the system is equilibrated using the so - called pivot transformations @xcite .",
    "there exist pivot transformations that are automatically preserving the topological state of the system , see for example @xcite , however they are able to modify only a very small part of the whole polymer , a fact that considerably increases the time for reaching the equilibrium , especially for very long polymers . in @xcite",
    "another method has been proposed , called the pivot algorithm and excluded area ( paea ) method , in which more general pivot transformations are considered , including those that could potentially change the topology . in this case ,",
    "large transformations are not easy to be implemented .    in conclusion ,",
    "apart from a few exceptions , like for instance the already cited works of @xcite and notably the dynamic monte carlo approach @xcite , that however leads to some level of polydispersity , in most numerical computations involving polymer knots , topological invariants are exploited whenever it becomes necessary to distinguish the topological configuration of the system under investigation .",
    "the most popular topological invariants are given in the form of polynomials or of multiple contour integrals computed along the physical trajectories of the polymers .",
    "the latter invariants are easier to be used in analytical models than the former , because the coefficients of the polynomials are not directly related to the polymer conformation .",
    "the particular simplicity of the gauss linking number , which consists in a double contour integral , is the main reason for which it has been possible to derive an analytical model of two linked polymer rings @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gauss linking number has already been used in numerical simulations of polymer systems , see for instance @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in order to distinguish the topology of knots , there is no simple invariant like the gauss linking number .",
    "so far , the statistical properties of polymer knots have been studied numerically with the help of topological invariants like the alexander polynomials @xcite or the homfly polynomials @xcite , see the detailed textbook by kleinert @xcite for an extensive review on that subject .",
    "of course , there is a plenty of other knot invariants that have been or could be applied , for instance the conway polynomials @xcite , the arf - casson invariant @xcite or the milnor @xcite and vassiliev - kontsevich invariants @xcite .",
    "the latter three have an explicit representation in terms of multiple integrals computed along the knot trajectories .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that knot invariants that are given in the form of multiple contour integrals can represent a valid alternative in numerical calculations to polynomial knot invariants or even to the paea method , which is able to detect the topology changes exactly and has been proven to allow very fast computations of the statistical properties of polymer knots @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will concentrate on a topological invariant denoted here @xmath2 , where @xmath4 denotes the trajectory of the knot .",
    "@xmath2 has been derived from the one - loop amplitudes of non - abelian chern - simons field theories with gauge group @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is related to the arf - casson invariant and to the second coefficient of the conway polynomials @xcite .",
    "its value can be analytically computed for any given knot configuration .",
    "@xmath2 is the simplest knot invariant represented in terms of multiple contour integrals .",
    "the knot invariant @xmath2 is applied here in order to derive the average values of the specific energy , heat capacity and gyration radius of several different knot configurations by means of the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .",
    "we find in this way that the examined knots , corresponding namely to the trefoil @xmath5 , the figure - eight @xmath6 and @xmath1 , undergo with the temperature a phase transition , which is probably from a frozen crystallite state to an expanded coil state similarly to what happens in the case of a single polymer chain proposed in  @xcite .",
    "other physical properties of polymer knots are discussed .",
    "compared with the paea method , the use of @xmath2 allows to reduce the number of samples necessary for the calculations of the averages of the observables with the wang - landau algorithm .",
    "as it will be seen , this reduction is due to the fact that with @xmath2 , large pivot transformations can be exploited which are able to change relevant portions of the knot . in this way , the exploration of the whole set of available conformations becomes faster . despite the decreasing of the number of samples , the computations last in general longer than those performed with the paea method , because the expression of @xmath2 contains quadruple integrals that should be evaluated numerically and this takes some time . as a consequence ,",
    "we present here the results for relatively short polymer knots up to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of segments composing the knot on a simple cubic lattice . actually , there is no problem in studying longer polymer knots .",
    "the reason is that invariants given in the form of contour integrals can be computed for arbitrarily deformed knots , not necessarily defined on a lattice , provided the topological configuration remains the same after the deformation .",
    "thanks to this fact , we have found that it is possible to shorten the number of segments by a factor three , speeding up the calculation of @xmath2 considerably . even using this trick",
    ", the method requires too long times ( exceeding a month on a modern workstation ) if @xmath9 .",
    "the use of @xmath2 becomes however competitive in the equilibration of very long polymers because , as already mentioned , it offers the possibility of exploring very fast the set of conformations compatible with the topological constraints .",
    "the rest of the current work is organized as follows .",
    "our simulation set - up and the topological invariant @xmath2 are introduced in section  [ sectionii ] .",
    "the monte carlo integration method we use to calculate the knot invariant @xmath2 is introduced in section  [ sectioniii ] .",
    "an explanation of the wang - landau algorithm with particular attention to its applications to the statistical mechanics of polymers is provided in section  [ sectioniv ] .",
    "the results on the thermal properties of different polymer knots are presented in section  [ sectionv ] .",
    "we also compare our calculations with the results obtained with the paea method in refs .",
    "finally , in section  [ sectionvi ] we draw our conclusions and possible generalizations of this work are briefly discussed .",
    "first of all , a brief digression on the used terminology is in order . throughout this work the word configuration refers to a particular topological state of a polymer knot .",
    "the word conformation will instead denote the particular shape in the space of the trajectory of a polymer knot in a given topological configuration .    at this point it is possible to go back to the outline of the methodology .",
    "we adopt the strategy of considering at the beginning a seed conformation of the knot to be analyzed .",
    "the knot is a self - avoiding polygon defined on a simple cubic lattice with edges of unit length .",
    "the monomers are located on the vertices of the lattice .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the total length of the polygon .",
    "since it consists of edges or segments of unit length , @xmath8 coincides also with the number of segments composing the polygon .",
    "the crossing of the knot trajectory with itself at some point on the lattice is forbidden .",
    "the starting seed configuration is equilibrated and then used to compute the thermodynamic properties of the studied knot .",
    "the relevant observables are calculated by means of the wang - landau monte carlo algorithm @xcite , which will be explained in some more details later .",
    "both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions are considered . for the equilibration of the knot and the sampling in the wang - landau algorithm ,",
    "the polymer conformations are randomly modified by exploiting the pivot transformations described in ref .",
    "these transformations can involve any number @xmath10 of segments such that @xmath11 and are not preventing the crossing of the lines of the knot trajectory @xmath4 .",
    "for that reason , the invariant @xmath2 should be applied in order to check if the topology of the knot has been altered after each pivot transformation .",
    "if this is the case , the transformation is rejected and a new one is considered .      to avoid topology changes of a polymer knot @xmath4 potentially occurring after the pivot transformations , we will use in this work a topological invariant that has been derived from the one - loop amplitude of the wilson loop in non - abelian @xmath3 chern - simons field theories @xcite .",
    "the most important characteristic of this invariant , that will be denoted @xmath2 , is that it can be expressed in the form of a sum of multiple contour integrals : @xmath12 where the knot @xmath4 is represented as an oriented closed path of length @xmath8 .",
    "the contribution @xmath13 is given by the triple integral : @xmath14 with @xmath15 while the second part @xmath16 is : @xmath17 in the above formulas greek letters denote space indexes .",
    "the variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are the components of the radius vectors describing the positions of four points on the same curve @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath21 represents instead the completely antisymmetric tensor uniquely defined by the condition @xmath22 .",
    "the integrations along the path @xmath4 in ( [ z2 ] ) and ( [ z4 ] ) are path ordered .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by parametrizing the trajectory @xmath4 with the arc - length :    @xmath23    and @xmath24    it has been shown that the knot invariant appearing above is related to the second coefficient @xmath25 of the conway polynomial of a knot @xmath4 through the following relation @xcite : @xmath26\\label{rela2rho}\\ ] ] the conway polynomials are well known and their coefficients can be computed analytically for every knot topology , so that thanks to eq .",
    "( [ rela2rho ] ) it is easy to derive also the values of @xmath2 . in table  [ table : conway ] we give a list of the second coefficients of the conway polynomial and the corresponding values of @xmath2 for the knot configurations that will be studied here .    .",
    "this table provides the values of the second coefficients of the conway polynomials and of the corresponding topological invariants for the trefoil @xmath5 , the figure - eight @xmath6 and the knot @xmath1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , > \" , ]     [ f - paea - mc ]    of course , the calculation of @xmath2 implies the evaluation of quadruple integrals with a good precision , otherwise there will be not a sufficient control of the topology . to perform the necessary integrations becomes challenging with increasing polymer lengths even using a monte carlo integration method as we did here .",
    "however , since what we need to calculate is the second conway coefficient and its value is dependent on the topological configuration of the knot , but not on its length , it is always possible to shorten the knot provided its topology is not affected . a simple way to do that is to group together triplets of contiguous segments of the knot",
    "this allows to decrease by a factor three the length of the polymer which , after this procedure , will be of course no longer defined on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "such reduction method can be combined with other reduction algorithms , like for instance the kmt reduction scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to come back to the problem of ergodicity .",
    "we have seen that the paea method is restricted up to now to small pivot transformations with @xmath27 .",
    "it is thus licit to ask if the danger arises , that with that method some relevant subset of polymer conformations is neglected . with this purpose in mind , we compared the results of the paea calculations of the density of states with those obtained using the knot invariant @xmath2 in order to distinguish the topology . with this knot invariant ,",
    "it is in fact possible to consider pivot transformations involving an arbitrary number of segments as explained before .",
    "we have found that the densities of states computed with the paea method and with the invariant @xmath2 are in complete agreement with each other . in fig .",
    "[ dost50 ] it is shown for example the case of the densities of states for a trefoil knot of length @xmath7 computed with the paea method ( grey squares ) and with the invariant @xmath2 evaluated using the monte carlo integration algorithm of section  [ sectioniii ] ( black circles ) .",
    "as it is possible to realize , both densities of states coincide .",
    "comparison of the densities of states @xmath28 for a trefoil knot with length @xmath7 computed using the paea method ( grey squares ) and the knot invariant @xmath2 evaluated with a monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm ( black circles ) .",
    ", width=288 ]",
    "in this work we have computed the specific energy , the specific heat capacity and the radius of gyration of the trefoil knot @xmath5 , the figure - eight @xmath6 and the knot @xmath1 .",
    "polymer knots have been generated on a simple cubic lattice and the conformations used in the wang - landau algorithm to get the density of states @xmath29 have been sampled by means of pivot transformations .",
    "the topology of polymer knots needs to be preserved during the sampling procedure . to this purpose ,",
    "the knot invariant @xmath2 has been employed .",
    "we have considered both attractive and repulsive short - range interactions between monomers .",
    "first , we have analyzed the simplest possible knot @xmath5 at various lengths @xmath30 .",
    "it has been observed that the specific energy of polymer knots is increasing with the increasing of the temperature irrespective of the fact that the interactions are attractive or repulsive .",
    "this is an expected result , because higher energy states should be reached as the temperature increases .",
    "less intuitive is that , at high temperatures , the specific energy of a knot in a given topological configuration grows with the increasing of the polymer length in the attractive case as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this behavior has been explained in section  [ sectionv ] by the following two facts : 1 ) attractive forces become negligible at high temperatures with respect to thermal fluctuation and 2 ) the effects of being knotted become less and less important with increasing polymer lengths . in a similar way",
    ", it has been possible to explain the decreasing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1-r](a ) of the specific energy with the polymer length at high temperatures in the repulsive case , see section  [ sectionv ] . in correspondence with the behavior of the specific energy , at high temperatures also",
    "the specific heat capacity of longer polymers is larger than that of shorter polymers in the attractive case , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , while it is smaller in the repulsive case , see fig .",
    "[ fig1-r](b ) .",
    "the specific heat capacity exhibits a very sharp peak in the temperature interval that has been considered .",
    "similar peaks have been observed in the specific heat capacity of single open linear chains for very short - range attractive interactions @xcite , in knots  @xcite and in star polymers @xcite",
    ". an analytical investigation of these phenomena can be found in @xcite . in the attractive case ,",
    "see section  [ sectionv ] , the peak of the heat capacity is apparently related to the phase transition of knots from a frozen crystallite state to an expanded state , similar to that of a single polymer chain @xcite . in the repulsive case ,",
    "the interpretion of the peaks is more complicated and is probably due to a lattice artifact as explained in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the mean square radius of gyration @xmath31 is displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) for the attractive and repulsive cases respectively .",
    "it turns out that longer polymers have bigger mean square gyration radius independently of the fact that the interactions are repulsive or attractive . indeed ,",
    "as it is intuitive , longer polymers should occupy larger volumes .",
    "our simulations show also that , in the attractive case , @xmath32 increases with the increasing of the temperature while , on the contrary , it decreases in the repulsive case .",
    "this phenomenon is connected with the analogous increasing and decreasing of the specific energy mentioned before . as a matter of fact , shorter radii of gyration imply higher specific energies in the repulsive case and lower specific energies in the attractive case .",
    "the influences of topology on the thermal properties of polymer knots have been studied by comparing knots of different types but of the same length . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig2-a ] and [ fig3b ] are respectively reported the data of the specific energy , heat capacity and gyration radius for the knots @xmath0 and @xmath1 with length @xmath33 . as it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in the attractive case the specific energy and heat capacity decrease with the knot complexity .",
    "this is due to the fact that with the increasing of the complexity of the topological configuration while the knot length is kept fixed , the conformation of the polymer becomes more compact and thus the number of contacts between the monomers becomes larger .",
    "the opposite situation is observed in the repulsive case .",
    "these results are in agreement with the conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    beside studying the thermodynamic properties of polymer knots ,",
    "the second purpose of this work has been a check of the feasibility of the use in numerical simulations of knot invariants which are given in the form of multiple contour integrals . for this reason ,",
    "we have considered one of the simplest knot invariant , namely the quantity @xmath2 which is related to the second coefficient of the conway polynomial .",
    "the most serious disadvantage of this kind of invariants is that the evaluation of the multiple integrals is time consuming even within the monte carlo approach adopted here .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that these knot invariants can be applied to any spatial curve @xmath4 representing the knot under investigation , not necessarily defined on a cubic lattice or with segments that are straight lines .",
    "this allows to reduce the number of segments composing the polymer considerably . for example , it is possible to replace in the knot trajectory up to three segments with a single segments , reducing in this way the polymer length by a factor three .",
    "up to now , our method can be efficiently exploited with polymer knots with lengths @xmath34 . another possibility to reduce the computation time comes from the fact that one of the integrations in the component @xmath35 of the knot invariant @xmath2 can be performed analytically . in this way , the time for calculating @xmath35 , which scales with the polymer length as @xmath36 ,",
    "may be reduced to @xmath37 .",
    "while there are faster algorithms to preserve the topology , like for instance the paea method discussed in @xcite , which is both exact and very fast for small pivot transformations involving up to @xmath38 segments , the use of knot invariants in the form of multiple contour integrals has the advantage that it works with any number of segments @xmath10 .",
    "this allows a faster equilibration of the polymer starting from a seed configuration and limits the number of sampling during the calculations with the wang - landau monte carlo algorithm .    in the future",
    ", we plan to extend the present approach , which is valid for knots , to the case of three linked polymers .",
    "this is possible because the triple milnor linking invariant @xcite , which is able to distinguish the topology of a link formed by three knots , is composed by four integrals that have the same tensor structure of the two components @xmath13 and @xmath35 of @xmath2 , see for example @xcite .      as shown in @xcite , in the contribution",
    "@xmath13 to the knot invariant @xmath2 the integration over the variable @xmath39 in eq .",

    "<S> in this work the thermodynamic properties of short polymer knots ( up to 120 segments ) defined on a simple cubic lattice are studied with the help of the wang - landau monte carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the sampling process is performed using pivot transformations starting from a given seed conformation . </S>",
    "<S> both cases of short - range attractive and repulsive interactions acting on the monomers are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the specific energy , heat capacity and gyration radius of the knots @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the heat capacity exhibits a sharp peak . </S>",
    "<S> if the interactions are attractive , similar peaks have been observed also in single open chains and have been related to the transition from a frozen crystallite state to an expanded coil state . </S>",
    "<S> some other peculiarities of the behavior of the analyzed observables are presented , like for instance the increasing or decreasing of the knot specific energy at high temperatures with increasing polymer lengths depending if the interactions are attractive or repulsive . besides the investigation of the thermodynamics of polymer knots , the second goal of this paper is to introduce a method for distinguishing the topology of a knot based on a topological invariant which is in the form of multiple contour integrals and </S>",
    "<S> explicitly depends on the physical trajectory of the knot . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen invariant , denoted here @xmath2 , is related to the second coefficient of the conway polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> it has been first isolated from the amplitudes of a chern - simons field theory with gauge group @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this invariant is very reliable in distinguishing the topology of polymer knots . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of the proposed approach is that it allows to reduce the number of samples needed by the wang - landau algorithm . some solutions to speed up the calculations of @xmath2 exploiting monte carlo integration techniques are developed . </S>"
