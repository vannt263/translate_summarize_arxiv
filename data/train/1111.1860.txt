    "the recent discovery of high-@xmath1 superconductivity in the ternary iron selenides a@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4 ( a = k ; rb ; cs ; ... )  @xcite has triggered a new surge of interest in study of iron - based superconductors ( fe - sc ) .",
    "the fascinating aspect of these material lies in the tunable fe - vacancies in these materials , which substantially modifies the normal - state metallic behavior and enhances the transition temperature @xmath1 to above 30k from 9k for the binary system fese at ambient pressure .",
    "@xcite particular attention has been focused on the vacancy ordered 245 system , k@xmath5fe@xmath6se@xmath4 , as it introduces a novel magnetic structure into the already rich magnetism of fe - sc . unlike the collinear  @xcite or bi - collinear  @xcite afm order observed in the parent compounds of other fe - sc , the neutron diffraction experiment has clearly shown that these materials have a block afm ( bafm ) order .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , the afm order with an unprecedentedly large magnetic moment of @xmath7/fe below the nel temperature is the largest one among all the known parent compounds of fe - sc .",
    "@xcite moreover , the carrier concentration is extremely low , indicating the parent compound to be a magnetic insulator / semiconductor ,  @xcite in comparison with a metallic spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state of the parent compound in other fe - sc .",
    "@xcite    the relation between the novel magnetism and superconductivity in ternary fe selenides is currently an interesting issue under debate .",
    "the question is whether the superconductivity and the bafm order are phase separated or co - exist in certain region of the phase diagram .",
    "the neutron experiment shows the suppression of the afm ordering below sc transition point ,  @xcite suggesting the coexistence .",
    "some other experiments , such as two - magnon raman - scattering ,  @xcite and muon - spin rotation and relaxation  @xcite are consistent with this picture . on the other hand , the arpes ,",
    "@xcite nmr  @xcite and tem  @xcite experiments indicate a mesoscopic phase separation between the superconductivity and the insulating afm state .",
    "most recently , li _ et al .",
    "_ showed the superconductivity and the bafm orders to occur at different layers of the fe - selenide planes in the stm measurement .",
    "@xcite    the vacancy in fe - selenides is an interesting but complicated issue .",
    "the vacancy in the fe - selenide carries a negative charge since the fe - ion has a valence of 2 + . in the equilibrium",
    ", we expect the vacancies to repel each other at short distance for the coulomb interaction and to attract to each other at a long distance for the elastic strain",
    ". such a scenario would be in favor of the phase separation to form a vacancy rich and vacancy poor regions in the compound .",
    "the challenge is then to explain the observed suppression of magnetic moment of the bafm due to the superconductivity . at the phenomenological level ,",
    "the suppression of magnetism due to superconductivity has been reported previously ,  @xcite and such phenomenon may be explained by ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we propose that the proximity effect of superconductivity to the bafm in a mesoscopically phase separated fe - selenides may be large to account the suppression of the afm moments observed in neutron experiment . more specifically",
    ", we use a microscopic model to study the proximity effect on a layer of the bafm state induced by adjacent sc layer . the proximity effect in fe - selenides",
    "is expected to be important for the two reasons .",
    "one is the weaker correlation effect , and the other is the larger interlayer hopping amplitude , compared with those in cuprates",
    ". both of them may enhance proximity effect on the magnetism from the neighboring sc layer .",
    "our model calculations show the proximity effect in a mesoscopically phase separated state of fe - selenides may explain various seemingly conflicted experiments .",
    "a@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4 is a layered material with fese layers separated by alkali atoms , similar to the 122 material in iron pnictides family . to investigate the proximity effect to the bafm layer",
    ", we consider a single bafm layer next to a sc layer as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian describing the bafm layer is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the electron motion and spin couplings in the bafm layer and @xmath10 describes the coupling to the neighboring sc layer .",
    "we consider a two - orbital model to describe @xmath9 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 annihilates an electron at site @xmath13 with orbital @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath19 are the hopping integrals , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denote the intra - block ( inter - block ) nearest ( nn ) and next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) bonds , respectively [ see the upper layer in fig .  [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the exchange coupling constants for nn ( nnn ) spins in the same block , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are for the two nn ( nnn ) spins in different blocks .",
    "the two - orbital model is a crude approximation for electronic structure .",
    "however , it may be a minimal model to capture some of basic physics in examining the proximity effect .",
    "the band structure around the obtained fermi energy from the two - orbital model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which is very similar to the result obtained in density functional theory .",
    "the main shortcoming in using the two - orbital model is that the magnetic moment is @xmath28b at largest , smaller than the experimentally measured @xmath29b .",
    "we consider this to be a quantitative issue , and will not qualitatively change our results .     in eq .",

    "we now consider @xmath10 , the coupling between sc layer and bafm layer . because of the semiconducting gap of the bafm layer and the sc gap in the sc layer , the leading order of the interlayer coupling are the pairing hopping between the sc and bafm layers . according to the crystal structures ,  @xcite",

    "motivated by the agreement of the self - consistent mean - field solutions with the mentioned first principle calculations , we consider now the proximity effect in bafm layer induced by the sc in sc layer . for explicit reason ,",
    "we choose two possible singlet pairing symmetries in the sc layer , i.e. , the nnn @xmath81-wave and the nn @xmath0-wave symmetries with their respective gap functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 $ ] , where the former results in the nnn bond and the latter the nn bond couplings in the bafm layer .",

    "a main difference between the @xmath81- and the @xmath0-wave symmetries is the more pronounced proximity effect in reducing the moment of the bafm order produced by the @xmath0-wave symmetry as the tunneling strength increase , as shown in figs .",

    "the unique feature of the the effective tunneling in the second order is it s temperature dependence via the sc pairing @xmath85 , which differs from that in one particle tunneling process .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of the sc pairing parameter is modeled by a phenomenological form with @xmath86 .",
    "we present the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) for the typical choice of the coupling constants @xmath87 . as temperature decrease ,",
    "the magnetic order increases when temperature is above @xmath1 , while it decreases when temperature is below @xmath1 , resulting in a broad peak around @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the temperature dependence of the afm moment is reminiscent of the neutron diffraction and the two - magnon experiments [ fig .  [ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "@xcite there is another scenario that the competition between the afm and the sc orders in the microscopic coexistence of them may also produce the decrease of the afm moment below @xmath1 .",
    "the study of such possibility is currently under way and the results will be published elsewhere .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the sizable proximity effect relies on the substantial interlayer hoping constant @xmath32 .",
    "based on the first principle calculation , the interlayer hopping @xmath32 was estimated to have a comparable magnitude with @xmath67 possibly due to the high values of electron mobility from the intercalated alkaline atoms ,  @xcite and leads to the highly three dimensional fermi surface .",

    "in summary , we have proposed that various seemingly conflict experiments on the phase separation or coexistence of superconductivity and bafm may be explained within a phase separation scenario by taking into account of the proximity effect of superconductivity to the neighboring layer of bafm .",
    "we have theoretically studied the proximity effect to a bafm layer induced by adjacent sc layers in a simplified two - orbital model for fe - selenides .",
    "the proximity effect in reducing the moment of the bafm order highly depends on the coupling constant @xmath88 . for realistic parameters of the interlayer tunneling",
    ", our calculation shows that the superconductivity proximity effect may result in substantial suppression of the magnetic moment .",
    "this is in contrary to that in the cuprate superconductor , where the coupling constant @xmath88 is very small because of small c - axis hopping integral due to the large anisotropy , and because of the renormalization of @xmath84 by a factor proportional to hole concentrations due to the no double - occupation condition .",
    "@xcite in iron - based superconductor , the anisotropy of iron - based material is much smaller than in the cuprate , which lead to a relative larger @xmath32 . and",
    "the moderate correlation effect in iron - based superconductor leads to a moderate renormalization factors . as a consequence ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath84 in iron chalcogenide superconductor should be moderate .",
    "we remark that we d be careful in drawing a concrete conclusion to compare with the experiments .",
    "the approximation that only @xmath15 and @xmath16 orbitals are important in the bands close to fermi energy is good in terms of the band structures .  @xcite but the maximum magnetic moment in two - orbital model is only @xmath28b , smaller than the moment of @xmath89b measured in experiments .",
    "@xcite the other effect is that we only calculated the suppression of the bafm order of the surface layer of the bafm domain . according to tem experiment ,  @xcite each bafm domain has around ten layers . and",
    "the suppression of bafm order of the layers in the middle of domain may be more complicated . in brief , the suppression of the bafm moment is sizable because of the moderate coupling constant @xmath84 , and our calculation may be viewed as a semi - quantitative result .",
    "we also investigated proximity effect for various pairing symmetry of the sc phase .",
    "it has shown that the sc pairing with nn @xmath0-wave symmetry resulted a more pronounced proximity effect in reducing the moment of the bafm order than the nnn @xmath81-wave pairing .",
    "the second order process induced proximity effect has a temperature dependent as the sc pairing , which may be relevant to the experimental observations .",
    "more remarkable proximity effect was found in the bafm state by comparison with the conventional afm state , which was the consequence of the frustrated structure and the associated anisotropic exchange interactions .",

    "in the following , we compare the above proximity effect with that in the single band conventional afm ( cafm ) system . in order to make the comparison more convincing , we choose the dispersion @xmath90 - 4t'\\cos(k_{x})\\cos(k_{y})-\\mu$ ] with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which gives rise to the similar energy band width with that in the above two - orbital model and is close to the case of the cuprates .",

    ", the magnitude of the magnetic order in both cases is renormalized . the proximity effect in reducing the afm order",

    "we can understand the above results by considering the different spin configurations of the bafm and cafm orders , as shown in fig .",

    ", the proximity effect in reducing the moment of the afm in the cafm state is rather weak for both the @xmath81- and @xmath0-wave pairing couplings . as for the induced pairing correlation",
    ", the extent of the match between the afm order configuration and the singlet sc pairing largely determines the magnitude of the induced pairing correlation .",
