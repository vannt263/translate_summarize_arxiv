    "the new family of superconducting materials which contain fe - as layers has attracted much attention since their discovery  @xcite .",
    "the fe - as layers are believed to be the conducting planes .",
    "the band calculations have shown that the fermi surface includes two hole pockets centered at @xmath5 points and two electron pockets centered at @xmath6 points , respectively  @xcite , which is confirmed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments have indicated that this family of materials is not conventional  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "probing the pairing symmetry is one of the most important issues since it can provide us the information of the pairing mechanism .",
    "so far , the pairing symmetry in iron - based superconductors is still controversial .",
    "one popular proposal for the pairing symmetry is the @xmath7-wave gap  @xcite , namely , the superconducting gap is extended @xmath3-wave and has opposite sign for the hole and electron pockets .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath3-wave gap symmetry is supported by penetration depth measurement  @xcite , arpes  @xcite and specific heat measurement  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the gap magnitudes at different fermi surface pockets measured by arpes experiments agree well with @xmath8 form ( here @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the momentum in the unfolded brillouin zone )  @xcite .",
    "however , although arpes experiment is a powerful tool to measure the gap magnitude directly , it can not determine the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "detecting the phase of order parameter is an essential and important step to map out the gap symmetry .",
    "recently several theoretical works propose different ways to measure the sign change of the gap  @xcite . while for multiband materials",
    ", probing the phase of the order parameter is still a quite challenging task .    the impurity effect has been an important part in the studies of the superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the impurity scattering is sensitive on the symmetry of the order parameter , thus it is a useful tool to probe the pairing symmetry .",
    "a well - known result of @xmath11-wave pairing in the cuprates is the zero bias peak in the local density of states ( ldos ) near the nonmagnetic impurity site . for the case of iron - based materials",
    ", it was proposed that the impurity scattering should be sensitive to the sign change of the @xmath7-symmetry order parameter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the averaged effect of an ensemble of impurities on the thermodynamic properties has been studied in iron - based materials  @xcite .",
    "the impurity - induced intra - gap state forms due to the inter - band scattering  @xcite for the sign - reversing fully gapped order parameter symmetry .",
    "we note that the calculation in ref  @xcite is based on a phenomenological approach , namely , they treat the intra - band scattering and inter - band scattering intensity as input parameters and consider an impurity concentration",
    ". however , such intra - gap state is not observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the impurity - induced intra - gap states are expected to exist only at or near the impurity site . to study the",
    "possibility and property of such states one effective method is to put one or several pointlike impurities in real space and calculate the ldos at or near the impurity site .",
    "basically two methods can be used , namely , the analytic @xmath12-matrix approach and the self - consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "based on the first method and taking into account the @xmath7 symmetry phenomenologically , very recently ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the ldos near the impurity site and do find the sharp resonance peaks inside the gap .",
    "the peaks will disappear if the phase of the order parameter is taken to be the same .",
    "the intra - gap bound states are actually located at the positive and negative energies and the ldos tends to be zero at low energies .",
    "the impurity effect is expected to be sensitive to the detailed band structure  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity maybe more remarkable for the multi - band materials . since the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a band structure which artificially fits the arpes experiments  @xcite , in the present paper we wish to examine the ldos at and near the impurity site based on a different two - band model as proposed by raghu @xmath0 @xmath1  @xcite , and the self - consistent bdg equations .",
    "the advantage of the bdg technique is that it calculates the order parameter in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "the gap magnitude is expected to be suppressed at and near the impurity site .",
    "it is proposed that such suppression effect needs to be taken into account to study the local impurity states  @xcite , i.e. , the suppression effect would enhance the intensity of the bound states and the peak width and position also depend on the amplitude of the suppression . for the case of the @xmath2 pairing symmetry ,",
    "our numerical results show that the intra - gap states exist as long as the scattering potential is strong enough , but the detailed spectra of the local impurity states are quite different and sensitive to the parameters for obtaining the band structure . for a nonmagnetic impurity with positive scattering potential ,",
    "we obtain two intra - gap resonance peaks .",
    "the resonance peaks are located near the coherent peaks for weak potentials and move to lower energy as the potential increases .",
    "the weight of the resonance peak with positive energy becomes very pronounced as the scattering potential reaching the unitary limit .",
    "for the cases of negative scattering potentials , the intra - gap resonance peaks are moving away from the coherent peaks and are closer to the fermi energy .",
    "the position of the resonance peaks are robust and depend weakly on the scattering potentials .",
    "all other features remain practically the same .",
    "we also studied the ldos spectra for the cases of the sign unchanged @xmath3-wave and nodal @xmath4-wave and no intra - gap peaks are observed .",
    "experimentally the ldos can be measured by stm experiments , and thus is a useful tool to probe the pairing symmetry of this family of compounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model and work out the formalism . in sec .",
    "iii , we persent the numerical calculations and discuss the obtained results .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in sec . iv .",
    "as we mentioned above , iron - based superconducting materials have a layered structure . in the feas layer there are two fe ions per unit cell by taking into account as ions located above or below the fe - fe plane .",
    "currently no consensus has been reached on what is the suitable model to capture the essential physics  @xcite .",
    "some groups argue all five 3@xmath11 orbitals have to be considered to construct a minimal model  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the band calculations have also shown that the main features of the bands that determine the fermi surface are the two orbitals @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "thus the two band model is proposed by several groups  @xcite . because we are concerned with the low energy physics in the present work",
    ", we expect that the qualitative result does not depend on the detailed band structure .",
    "we here use the two band model considering the two degenerate orbitals @xmath13 and @xmath15 per site  @xcite . on the two - dimensional square lattice , the model hamiltonian reads , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hopping term , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the site indices and @xmath20 are the orbital indices .",

    "the intra - gap states for @xmath2-pairing symmetry obtained here are quite robust for a strong impurity .",
    "the electron operator for each orbital is a linear combination of quasiparticle operators from all bands , therefore the four fermi surface pockets in fig.1(b ) are contributed by the hybridigation of the two orbitals . with this observation",

    "however , we stress that the sign change of the order parameter is just one of the essential conditions for the bound states but not sufficient .",
    "the scattering is weighted by the bogoliubov amplitude so the band structure and the detailed scattering potential form is also important .",
    "for the current model , the @xmath11-wave pairing symmetry will not produce the bound states , as seen in figs.4(c ) and 4(d ) .",

    "in summary , we have studied the point - like single non - magnetic impurity scattering effect in iron - based superconductors based on self - consistent bdg equations .",
    "the ldos at and near the impurity site are calculated and the spectra have their unique features for different pairing symmetry .",
    "especially , for the case of the @xmath2-wave symmetry , two intra - gap peaks show up as the impurity scattering potential is strong enough .",
    "this may also be easily detected by the stm experiments through substituting the fe atom with a nonmagnetic atoms ( e.g. , zn or ba atoms etc . ) . as a result",
    ", we propose that the non - magnetic impurity can be used to probe the pairing symmetry of iron based superconductors .",
