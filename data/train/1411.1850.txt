    "sticks_. one natural question concerning stick knots may be the _ stick number _ @xmath0 of a knot @xmath1 which is defined to be the minimal number of sticks necessary to construct this stick knot .",
    "several upper and lower bounds on stick number for various classes of knots and links were founded .",
    "the most general result is negami s inequality @xcite : @xmath8 for any nontrivial knot or link @xmath1 other than the hopf link , where @xmath2 is the minimal crossing number of @xmath1 .",
    "calvo @xcite improved the lower bound to @xmath9 . recently",
    "huh and oh @xcite utilized the arc index @xmath10 to determine more precise upper bound , showing that @xmath11 for any nontrivial knot @xmath1 ( especially @xmath12 for a non - alternating prime knot ) .",
    "they mainly use the fact that @xmath13 for any nontrivial knot @xmath1 in @xcite and converted each arc presentation of @xmath1 into a stick knot by using @xmath14 sticks .",

    "there is another way to obtain an upper bound of the stick number for particular classes of knots and links .",
    "mccabe @xcite proved that @xmath19 for any @xmath5-bridge knot or link @xmath1 other than the unlink and the hopf link by realizing the stick knot visually with @xmath20 sticks . this upper bound is sharp for small knots and links of at most five crossings . in @xcite furstenberg et al .",

    "we describe the standard projection of a @xmath5-bridge knot or link in terms of the conway notation which will be useful for the stick construction .",
    "conway @xcite introduced the concept of tangles , portions of a knot contained in a topological sphere which intersect the knot exactly four times .",
    "an _ integral tangle _ is made from two strands that wrap around each other , and identified by the number of half - twists ( i.e. crossings ) within it as in figure [ fig : conway](a ) .",
    "more precisely the integer inside the circle is positive if it indicates the number of right - handed half - twists and negative if left - handed .",
    "these integral tangles are connected together as in figure [ fig : conway](b ) to form a @xmath5-bridge knot or link which is represented by a _",
    "conway notation _",
    "note that if all @xmath28 are positive integers , then the positive and negative signs of integers in the figure appear alternately , so it gives a non - nugatory alternating projection of a @xmath5-bridge knot or link .    as summarized in (",

    "we may assume that @xmath30 . for ,",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we use the conway notation @xmath33 instead of the original one , both of which indicate the same knot or link . and when @xmath34 , we can use its mirror image @xmath35 which has eventually the same crossing number and stick number as the original one .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we illustrate how to construct integral @xmath36-tangles with @xmath37 by using @xmath38 sticks .",
    "now observe the @xmath39-tangle which consists of right - handed @xmath39 half - twists as in figure [ fig : tangle](a ) . in this construction , this tangle with @xmath39 even has one vertical stick , called a _ core stick _ , and the remaining @xmath39 sticks wrapping around the core stick .",
    "and the tangle with @xmath39 odd has two sticks which are almost parallel and very close to each other at their one endpoints so that they look like two slightly perturbed broken pieces of the core stick , and @xmath40 sticks wrapping around these two sticks as in the figure .",
    "both tangles have right - handed @xmath39 half - twists respectively , and so @xmath39 crossings .",
    "the right figure shows the drawing of the tangle with @xmath39 even in the view point from the top .",
    "the @xmath41-tangle is simply the mirror image of the positive one .",
    "we use symbols with circles and numbers as drawn in figure [ fig : tangle](b ) to indicate these tangles .",
    "let @xmath1 be any @xmath5-bridge knot or link with @xmath26 . recall that @xmath1 has a conway notation @xmath27 where @xmath29 is odd and all @xmath28 are positive integers with @xmath30 . here",
    ".    first we construct @xmath1 of a conway notation @xmath43 when @xmath44 by using @xmath45 sticks .",
    "@xmath1 can be obtained from the @xmath46-tangle by closing off the four ends in the standard way .",
    "as drawn in figure [ fig : p ] , we utilize the @xmath47-tangle consisting of @xmath48 sticks and add the remaining @xmath49 sticks to make @xmath50 more left - handed half - twists as needed .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows a specific realization of the link @xmath51 which is the union of two unknotted circles both of which consist of four sticks .",
    "the coordinates of vertices are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "following the tangle construction in the previous section we can replace the @xmath54-tangle by the @xmath47-tangle .",
    "hence this specific example verifies that our scheme is also realizable for any case @xmath55 .",
    "now we construct @xmath1 of a conway notation @xmath56 for positive integers @xmath57 with @xmath58 by using @xmath59 sticks .",
    "assume that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the general case .",
    "as in the first link in figure [ fig : pqr ] , we rotate the @xmath46-tangle part around a horizontal line for untwisting one half - twist of the @xmath62-tangle . since all three integers @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are at least @xmath5 , we can construct these @xmath46-tangle , @xmath65-tangle and @xmath66-tangle by using @xmath59 sticks in total as described in the last paragraph of section [ sec : conway ] .",
    "now connect them together to build a knot or link @xmath56 as drawn in the figure so that two pairs of sticks are joined into two sticks and two new sticks are added for closing off .",
    "thus the total number of sticks are unchanged as desired .",
    "easy calculation tells us that there are five more non - general cases as follows ; @xmath67 with @xmath60 and @xmath58 , @xmath68 with @xmath60 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath61 and @xmath58 , @xmath71 with @xmath69 , and @xmath72 with @xmath73 . note that the case @xmath68 with @xmath74 and @xmath58 has the same result as @xmath68 with @xmath60 and @xmath69 .",
    "similar constructions to the general case can be applied for these five cases .",
    "the results of all the cases are drawn in figure [ fig : pqr ] .",
    "one can see that each has exactly @xmath59 sticks . to guarantee that all these six cases can be realized in @xmath7-space",
    "as intended , we provide the vertex - coordinates of the simplest case of each , such as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the following table .",
    "note that each of the cases @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 consists of two circles , so they need two sets of vertices indicating two circles respectively .",
    "+        +   + finally we construct @xmath1 of a conway notation @xmath27 for the cases of @xmath81 by using @xmath82 sticks , that is @xmath83 sticks .",
    "first we consider the general cases that all @xmath28 are greater than @xmath21 .",
    "see figure [ fig : general ] .",
    "we construct all @xmath84-tangles individually by using @xmath85 sticks in total .",
    "now connect them together to build the knot or link as drawn in the figure .",
    "in this scheme , all @xmath28-tangles with @xmath86 even share just one core stick , and each pair of @xmath84-tangle and @xmath87-tangle for @xmath88 share exactly one stick . on the other hand we have to add some extra sticks to connect each pair of @xmath89-tangle and @xmath90-tangle for @xmath91 , and two more sticks to connect the left - most core stick to @xmath92-tangle and @xmath93-tangle .",
    "thus the total number of sticks is @xmath94 that is @xmath82 .",
    "now we illustrate how to build up a stick presentation of a special case where all @xmath28 s are @xmath5 in three stages as in figure [ fig : realization ] .",
    "note that one can easily apply this construction to general cases where some of @xmath28 s are greater than @xmath5 . at the first stage of this construction ,",
    "figure [ fig : realization](a ) shows how to build the main frame of this stick presentation .",
    "starting from the origin point @xmath95 in @xmath96 , take a long vertical stick along @xmath97-axis , and more sticks wrapping around this vertical stick from top to bottom so that these non - vertical sticks rotate clockwise in the view point from the top .",
    "let @xmath98 be the terminal point of this part .",
    "the intermediate point @xmath99 in the figure is placed on the @xmath100-plane so that its @xmath101-coordinate is positive . in figure",
    "[ fig : realization](b ) we see how a connected series of sticks runs back and forth between the sticks constructed already .",
    "the two end points of this connected series of sticks are denoted by @xmath102 and @xmath103 . finally as in figure",
    "[ fig : realization](c ) we connect @xmath102 and @xmath103 by two sticks which share one end point @xmath104 .",
    "obviously the vertex @xmath104 must lie far below the @xmath100-plane .",
    "also we connect @xmath105 and @xmath98 by two sticks sharing one end point @xmath106 which lies farther below than the the vertex @xmath104 with respect to the @xmath107-coordinate .",
    "now we handle the cases when @xmath28 s are @xmath21 .",
    "we distinguish six cases .",
    "the first three cases are illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] and the other cases are in figure [ fig:11 ] .",
    "first consider the case @xmath108 for some @xmath86 among odd integers @xmath109 .",
    "replace the subgraph of the main graph between two horizontal lines by the graph indicating @xmath108 drawn on the right top in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "next consider the case @xmath108 for some @xmath86 among even integers @xmath110 .",
    "replace the related subgraph by the graph drawn on the right middle . in this case",
    "the main frame will be bent slightly . for the case",
    "@xmath111 , replace the related subgraph by the graph on the right bottom .",
    "note that the stick @xmath112 does not pass the other sticks because the vertex @xmath104 lies far below the @xmath100-plane .",
    "now consider the next three cases where both or either @xmath113 or @xmath114 is @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig:11](a ) illustrates how to realize our scheme for the case @xmath115 . at the top of the main graph",
    "we remove the dotted line segments and connect the two pairs of end points properly .",
    "note again that the stick @xmath112 does not pass the other sticks .",
