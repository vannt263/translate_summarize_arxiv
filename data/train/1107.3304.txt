    "in a recent paper @xcite , a connection was observed between the notion of prior probabilities @xcite and the optimal performance of certain models of quantum heat engines @xcite . as a central feature of bayesian inference ,",
    "these probabilities quantify the uncertainty or equivalently , the lack of complete knowledge about some parameters of the problem .",
    "it was found @xcite that a power - law choice of the prior , yields the expected optimal performance of the quantum engine at certain well - known thermal efficiencies such as curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) efficiency @xcite .",
    "this observation is remarkable from at least two viewpoints : i ) the ca efficiency is well - known to be a finite - time thermodynamic result , where it arises within endoreversible thermodynamic models as efficiency at maximum power .",
    "but the cycle considered in ref .",
    "@xcite runs infinitely slow ; ii ) the derivation of this result based on bayesian approach suggests a very different origin of these efficiencies by connecting them with the notion of incomplete information .",
    "let us clarify about the source of the assumed incomplete information .",
    "usually , incomplete information about the state of a quantum system is meant to refer to an uncertain preparation procedure , the state being defined by a mixed state density matrix @xmath2 .",
    "this ensemble is characterised by a hamiltonian @xmath3 of the system , a function of externally controllable parameters ( collectively denoted by @xmath4 ) , such as magnetic field , coupling strength with environment / subsystems and so on .",
    "one may say that the state or the ensemble is characterised by the choice of these external parameters . in the present discussion , we assume an ignorance about the exact values of these parameters .",
    "our focus is on the following issue : can someone who is ignorant of the exact values of certain control parameters for the system , make some reasonable estimates about its behavior ?",
    "the particular physical problem that we choose is the performance of heat engines . in particular , we ask how should one quantify one s ignorance about the configuration of a quantum heat engine and what are the estimates for its expected performance ?",
    "now we may possess some prior information about a parameter which is uncertain in the above sense , such as the possible range of values or , other inputs from the physics of the problem .",
    "based on that we assign probabilities for the likely values of this parameter",
    ". however , these probabilities are to be interpreted in the sense of rational degree of belief @xcite . thus essentially we interpret our ignorance about parameters of the system from a bayesian perspective .",
    "formally , one may say that we are considering an ensemble of subensembles , where each subensemble is characterised by a hamiltonian @xmath3 , and the possible values of @xmath4 over different subsensembles are described by a prior distribution .",
    "we may refer to the ensemble so considered as the _ prior ensemble _ , but the ensemble is regarded here as a theoretical construct only .",
    "our aim is to quantify the prior information about the uncertain parameters as a prior distribution and to use this prior to make estimates about the behavior of the system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive and justify the choice of the prior from more basic underlying assumptions and to further clarify the subjective approach .",
    "our quantum model of a heat engine consists of a pair of weakly interacting two - level systems , which is closely analogous to the model of @xcite .",
    "there are two reservoirs characterised by temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , we have two energy scales , denoted by @xmath7 refering to the level spacing of a two - level system .",
    "these spacings are controllable externally e.g. via magnetic field , but are here assumed to be uncertain . it is these energy scales for which we assign a prior .",
    "the form of the prior we derive for parameter @xmath8 , is the @xmath9 law .",
    "we show the consequences of using such a prior for the expected values of physical quantities such as efficiency , work and so on .",
    "we observe that the assignment of the prior is such that it leads us to _ expect _ a thermodynamic like behavior in these quantum models .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model for heat engine and summarise its main features . in section iii , we assume incomplete information about internal energy scales of the working medium and so derive the prior for them based on some simple assumptions . in section iv , we apply the prior so derived to estimate thermal efficiency of the engine , final temperature , work extracted and so on . in section v , we highlight a specific asymptotic limit in which the expected behavior becomes especially simple .",
    "section vi , addresses a special case by including a constraint .",
    "the final section vii is devoted to conclusions and future outlook .",
    "consider a pair of two - level systems labeled r and s , with hamiltonians @xmath10 and @xmath11 having energy eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "the initial mean energy of each system is @xmath25 where @xmath26 denote system r and s respectively . within the approach based on quantum thermodynamics @xcite ,",
    "the process of maximum work extraction is identified as a quantum unitary process on the thermally isolated composite system .",
    "it preserves not just the magnitude of von neumann entropy of the composite system , but also all eigenvalues of its density matrix .",
    "it has been shown in these works that for @xmath27 , such a process minimises the final energy if the final state is given by @xmath28 .",
    "effectively , it means that in the final state the two systems _ swap _ between themselves their initial probability distributions .",

    "the question we address in the following is : what can we then infer about the expected behaviour of physical quantities for this heat engine ( such as work per cycle , efficiency and so on ) ?",
    "we shall follow a subjective approach to probability to address this question .",
    "this implies that an uncertain parameter is assigned a prior distribution , which quantifies our priliminary expectation about the parameter to take a certain value .",

    "the prior should be assigned by taking into account any prior knowledge or information we possess about the parameters .",
    "for example , if @xmath46 is specified , then the prior distribution for @xmath47 , @xmath49 is conditioned on the specified value of @xmath46 , and is defined in the range @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 , because we know the set - up works like an engine if we implement eq .",

    "the expected value of any physical quantity @xmath52 which may be function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is defined as follows : @xmath53      in bayesian probability theory , the assignment of a unique prior is a central issue .",
    "it should quantify not only the prior knowledge about the parameter in the particular context , but should meet a consistency criterion according to which different observers in possession of equivalent information should assign similar priors .",
    "suppose , one knows only the range within which the parameter takes its values , then intuition suggests that a uniform distribution may reflect the state of our knowledge .",
    "but such a choice is not invariant under reparameterizations .",
    "our aim in the following is to motivate the assignment of prior distributions for level spacings @xmath46 and @xmath47 , when the physical problem at hand is a heat engine as described in section ( [ model ] ) .",
    "it seems convenient to speak in terms of the two observers a and b , who wish to assign priors for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the assignment is based on the following assumptions :    \\(a ) same functional form of the prior is assigned to @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the _ initial state _ ,",
    "denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "further , we assume that the prior can be expressed as @xmath56 , using a continuous differentiable function @xmath57 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "\\(b ) the conditional prior distributions @xmath58 , implying distribution for @xmath59 given a value of @xmath8 , or @xmath60 for the converse case , have the same functional form as above , and we assume that @xmath61 , where the dependence on @xmath8 may be present in the normalisation factor .",
    "similarly , we assume @xmath62 .",
    "assumption ( a ) is reasonable since both @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the same physical quantity , and the state of knowledge of a and b about them is the same , which is the fact that their values _ in the initial state _ lie in a preassigned range @xmath63 , @xmath64 $ ] . for simplicity and symmetry , we take this range to be identical for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . presumably , this range depends on the experimental setup , and we assume similar apparatus for controlling the level spacings of systems r and s.    now if one of the parameters is specified to an observer , say @xmath46 to a , then a knows that the machine works as an engine only if the range of @xmath47 is [ @xmath65 , @xmath46 ] , where @xmath46 here represents some fixed value .",

    "but the range assigned for the other parameter @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) , conditional on the operation as an engine , is different .",

    "proximity to this value at the optimal performance has been studied in many recent models and a certain universality has been observed @xcite . in this context , this predictability about the optimal behavior by using an appropriate prior for ignorance , is remarkable .    for the present model of heat engine , we have compared the estimated work per cycle in the general case of ignorance of two parameters with the special case of ignorance of one parameter only .",
    "heuristically , one can anticipate that the expected work should increase when additional constraints are introduced which lead to reduced uncertainty about the system .",
    "in particular , the ratio of these two values of work , tends to a limiting value of 3/4 as the two bath temperatures approach each other .",
    "similarly , the estimated efficiency close to equilibrium for the general case is one - third of carnot value , as contrasted with the one - half carnot value as found for the special case .",
    "this may indicate that the general case of prior ignorance about two parameters may belong to a different universality class than the special case of ignorance about a single parameter , which is bounded from below by half carnot value @xcite .",
    "further , we note that in a model of irreversible brownian heat engine @xcite , when the power is optimised with respect to the load and the barrier height , the efficiency at optimal power is found to be given by @xmath152 close to equilibrium , this efficiency has the same expansion as given by eq .",
    "( [ expneta3 ] ) , upto second order .",
    "concluding , our analysis suggests an unexpected relation between the average performance of certain infinite time quantum models of heat engines infered by a bayesian analysis and the optimal performance of finite time thermodynamic models . in our opinion ,",
    "the present study raises basic issues and open problems which we are addressing in future work , such as how robust is the predictability about efficiency at optimal work by choosing other models of engines , and to further investigate the influence of constraints on the expected behavior .",
