    "the first exchanged virtual photon can excite the proton to a higher state and the second virtual photon de - excites the proton back to its ground state .",
    "tpe will affect the cross section through its interference with the single photon exchange ( first born approximation ) amplitude .",
    "this should be smaller than the born cross section by a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "however , the size of the tpe contribution to the cross section is expected to have a significant @xmath5 dependence  @xcite that grows with @xmath7 , while the @xmath5-dependent part of the unpolarized cross section in the born approximation becomes very small at large @xmath7 .    calculations of the box and crossed tpe diagrams ( figs .",

    "the interference between one- and two - photon exchange diagrams has the opposite sign for electrons and positrons while most of the other radiative corrections are identical for electrons and positrons and cancel in the ratio .",
    "apart from tpe , the only other charge - dependent contribution comes from the interference between the lepton and proton bremsstrahlung radiation terms , which is of comparable size to the tpe effect .    the ratio of the @xmath29 elastic scattering cross sections can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total charge - even radiative correction factor and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the tpe and lepton  proton bremsstrahlung interference contributions .",

    "at @xmath39 gev@xmath4 the discrepancy is smaller and provides a less sensitive constraint on tpe contributions  @xcite , though is consistent with a few per cent correction .    in the 1960s and 1970s",
    "there were several attempts to determine the tpe corrections to electron - proton elastic scattering .",
    "early measurements comparing electron and positron elastic - scattering cross sections  @xcite were largely limited to low @xmath7 and/or high @xmath5 , where calculations  @xcite suggest that tpe contributions are small .",

    "improved measurements of these contributions , in particular for large @xmath7 and small @xmath5 values , are required to reconcile the form factor discrepancy .",
    "there have been several recent attempts to make improved tpe measurements by comparing @xmath29 scattering .",

    ", we generated a mixed beam of positrons and electrons covering a wide range of energies and used the large - acceptance clas spectrometer in experimental hall b at jefferson lab to detect both the scattered lepton and the struck proton .",
    "the over - constrained elastic - scattering kinematics allowed us to reject inelastic events and to determine the energy of the incident lepton in each event .",

    "this paper is a follow up to our previously published results  @xcite and includes corrections for @xmath31 along with previously unpublished results .",
    "this experiment was conducted at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab ) .",
    "a simultaneous mixed beam of electrons and positrons was produced using the 5.6 gev primary electron beam from the accelerator ( see fig .",

    "bremsstrahlung photons were produced by bombarding a @xmath46 radiation length ( rl ) gold radiator with a 110 - 140-na electron beam .",
    "the resulting photon beam traversed a 12.7-mm inner - diameter nickel collimator , while the electrons were diverted into the tagger beam dump by the hall b tagger magnet @xcite .",
    "the photon beam then struck a 0.09 rl gold converter to produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "the mixed lepton - photon beam then passed through a three - dipole magnet chicane .",
    "the chicane bent electrons and positrons in the opposite directions , spatially separating them in the horizontal plane ( shown as a vertical separation in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpesketch ] ) .",
    "the photon beam was stopped by a 4-cm - wide and 35-cm - long tungsten block placed at the upstream face of the second dipole .",
    "the electron and positron beams were then recombined into a single beam by the third dipole .",
    "the mixed lepton beam then passed through a pair of collimators en route to a 6 cm - diameter , 30-cm long liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath47 ) target .",
    "the scattered leptons and the protons were detected in the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas )  @xcite .",
    "the first and third dipoles of the tpe chicane were operated with a magnetic field of @xmath48 t and were about 0.5 m long .",
    "they were powered in series by a single power supply .",
    "the second dipole had a field of @xmath49 t and was about 1 m long .",
    "the momentum acceptance of the chicane is fixed by the width of the photon blocker and the apertures of the second dipole .",
    "the width of the photon blocker ( @xmath50 cm ) fixed the maximum lepton momentum and the aperture of approximately @xmath51 cm fixed the minimum lepton momentum .",
    "in the ideal case the three dipoles are left - right symmetric and the two lepton beams should be identical .",
    "the final useful lepton beam energy ranged from approximately 0.5 to 3.5 gev .",
    "this experiment ran with a much higher primary electron beam current and much thicker radiator than is normally used in clas photoproduction experiments and the process of producing a tertiary mixed beam produced a large rate of background radiation in the hall . to protect clas from this radiation a number of shielding structures ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpesketch ] ) were installed in the hall .",
    "two large shielding structures were constructed between the first and second dipoles of the chicane and between the second and third dipoles of the chicane .",
    "a 1-m by 1-m by 0.1-m thick lead wall was placed immediately downstream of the chicane .",
    "the lepton beams passed through a 1.75-cm diameter tungsten collimator in this wall .",
    "further downstream just before clas was a 4-m by 4-m by 2.5-cm thick steel wall .",
    "a second lepton beam collimator made of lead with a 4-cm diameter aperture was located at the entrance to clas .",
    "the shielding around the clas tagger beam dump was increased during a 2004 test run @xcite and remained in place for this experiment .",
    "this shielding was designed to remove backgrounds from the beamline and beam dump that would otherwise overwhelm the clas detector systems .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for this analysis , we have to select a subset of our data , to avoid double counting of data included in more than one binning scheme .",
    "we take the high-@xmath7 data ( bins 59 ) and the high-@xmath5 data ( bins 1418 , excluding bin 19 which overlaps bins 8 and 9 ) .",
    "we also include the two low-@xmath7 , low-@xmath5 data points ( bins 1 and 2 ) , which do not overlap with the bins at high-@xmath7 or high-@xmath5 .",
    "this yields a total of 12 data points from our measurement . for the novosibirsk data , we use the four non - normalization data points ,",
    "including the 0.3% systematic uncertainty applied to account for the model - dependence of the high-@xmath5 normalization procedure .",
    "the comparison of the clas plus vepp-3 data ( 16 data points total ) to the various models is summarized in table  [ tab : global ] .",
    "the data are in good agreement with the hadronic calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite but of insufficient precision to make any definitive distinction between them .",
    "however , the data exclude the no - tpe hypothesis at the @xmath52 level , and rule out the point - proton result at the @xmath53 level .",
    "the point - proton result has sometimes been used to approximate tpe corrections at low @xmath7 values  @xcite .",
    "the fit includes a variation of the normalization uncertainty associated with the model dependence of the radiative corrections , which increases all of the clas ratios by roughly 0.3% for the fit to the hadronic calculation and decreases it by a similar amount for the point - like comparison .",
    "our results , along with recently published results from vepp-3 , rule out the zero tpe effect hypothesis at the 99.4% confidence level and are in excellent agreement ( @xmath54 to 1.09 ) with the calculations  @xcite that include tpe effects and largely reconcile the form - factor discrepancy .",
    "the combined world data are consistent with an increase in @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath5 at @xmath3 and 1.45 gev@xmath4 . a slight , non - statistically significant , increase in @xmath2 with @xmath7",
