    "w43 is one of the most prominent regions of massive star formation in the inner galaxy  .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : w43 ] , it contains two of the largest molecular cloud groups of the first galactic quadrant : w43-main at @xmath1 307 and w43-south at @xmath1 299 .",
    "w43-main is famous for its giant  region powered by a cluster of ob and wolf - rayet stars , which emit a lyman continuum luminosity of @xmath2 ionizing photons per second , and has a far - infrared luminosity of 3.5 @xmath3 . for the very active star - forming phenomena in its center",
    ", w43-main is considered a `` mini - starburst '' , and three extremely massive dense cores w43-mm1 , w43-mm2 and w43-mm3 were suggested to be potentially forming high - mass stars by @xcite and confirmed by .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered two ridge - like structures and extended sio emission toward w43-main ; the spatial and velocity overlap between the high - density ridge and the shocked sio gas suggest that the ridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompanied by low - velocity shocks .",
    "accurate distances are crucial to derive fundamental physical parameters of the molecular clouds .",
    "size depends directly on distance and luminosity scales as the square of distance . the commonly used methods to determine the distance of w43 are kinematic distance estimates based on radial velocity measurements and a galactic rotation curve , and luminosity distances based on dereddened colors and spectral type .",
    "however , kinematic distance have uncertainties , often @xmath4 20% , which are highly dependent on location in the galaxy  @xcite ; for cases with large peculiar motions can be over a factor of two  @xcite . in addition",
    ", one needs to add uncertainties from the adopted values of galactic parameters whereas trigonometric parallax is essentially a direct and assumption free method . due to difficulties in classifying spectral types and calibrating luminosities",
    ", it is hard to determine distances accurately by photometry and spectroscopy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "previous investigators have derived distances of 4  7 kpc to w43  .",
    "the most reliable method for astronomical distance measurement is the trigonometric parallax .",
    "recently , trigonometric parallax measurements of masers in star - forming regions using the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques have shown that the parallaxes can be accurately determined at the level of @xmath5  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "motivated by these measurements , we are using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) to conduct a key science project , the bar and spiral structure legacy ( bessel ) survey  @xcite , to study the structure and kinematics of the galaxy by measuring parallaxes and proper motions for hundreds of 22 ghz  and 6.7/12.2 ghz  maser sources associated with massive star - forming regions .",
    "several masers have been discovered in w43 ( within the region 29  @xmath6 , @xmath7  @xmath81 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : w43 ] shows two source pairs in w43 :  and  located in w43-south and  and  located in the northern portion of w43-main .  and  are ultra - compact ( uc )  regions powered by an o star .",
    "the 6.7 ghz  @xcite and 12.2 ghz  @xcite  maser sites and local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocities coincide with values determined for masers   and an nh@xmath9 hot core , which is believed to be a signpost of an embedded high - mass star in an early stage of formation  .",
    "is an uc  region and a candidate for hosting a massive protostar  .",
    "the 12 ghz methanol maser in  was discovered by @xcite .",
    "based on a multi - wavelength study , this methanol maser site was found to be associated with an  region and an infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) source , but it is separated from the radio peak by 3.5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 au , assuming a distance of 5.6 kpc  .  hosts a  maser and a 6.7 ghz  maser source  , and it is associated with an region  @xcite and the iras source 18461@xmath120113  .    in this paper , we present results of parallax and proper motion measurements of the four masers , , , and  in the massive star - forming complex w43 from vlba observations that are part of the bessel survey .",
    "these sources are located in the first quadrant of the galaxy , where kinematic distances are subject to a kinematic distance ambiguity .",
    "our direct measurements of distance solve the ambiguity for w43 and help locate the spiral arm in which w43 resides .",
    "this star - forming complex is located toward the end of the central bar of the galaxy . combining distance , , and proper motion of the masers yields their full space motions , which help us to study the kinematics of this complicated region .",
    "our observations of 12 ghz methanol and 22 ghz water masers , together with several compact extragalactic radio sources , were carried out under vlba programs br145o , br145q , and br145w and spanned one year . for these sources ,",
    "the parallax signature in declination is considerably smaller than for right ascension , and we scheduled the observations so as to maximize the right ascension parallax offsets as well as to minimize correlations among the parallax and proper motion parameters .",
    "our general observing setup and calibration procedures are described in @xcite ; here , we discuss only aspects of the observations that are specific to the maser sources presented in this paper .",
    "we used four adjacent intermediate frequency ( if ) bands of 8 mhz and recorded both right and left circular polarizations ( rcp and lcp ) . the second if band was centered on the maser signal at an velocity of 100  for , 96  for , 110  for , and 99  for .",
    "we observed three international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) sources  @xcite , near the beginning , middle , and end of the phase - referencing observations to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among the observing bands .",
    "the observing frequency , velocity resolution for line observation , and epochs are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .    at each epoch , the observations consisted of four 0.5-hour `` geodetic blocks '' ( used to calibrate and remove unmodeled atmospheric signal delays ) , and three 1.7-hour periods of phase - referenced observations inserted between these blocks . in the phase - referenced observations , we cycled between the target maser and several background sources , switching sources every 30 to 40 seconds",
    ". table  [ tab : src ] lists the observed source positions , intensities , source separations , reference maser lsr velocities , and restoring beams .",
    "the interferometric correlation was performed with the difx software correlator @xcite in socorro , nm . the data reduction was conducted using the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) together with scripts written in parseltongue @xcite .",
    "a spectral channel with strong and compact maser emission was used as the interferometer phase reference . after performing the calibration for the polarized bands separately , we combined the rcp and lcp bands to form stokes i and imaged the continuum emission of the background sources , integrating the four if bands using the aips task imagr . for the masers , we also formed stokes i data and then imaged the emission in each spectral channel .",
    "we determined source positions by fitting elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to the images of strong maser spots and background sources using the aips task sad or jmfit .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , relative positions for sources ( i.e. , maser and quasar sources ) at low antenna elevations are very sensitive to atmospheric delay errors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further , our sources are located at near - zero declination , where phase calibration errors can lead to limited dynamic range images .",
    "therefore , we adopted an elevation cutoff of 25   30 , below which data were discarded for each antenna , allowing for improved images with dynamic range of better than 15:1 .",
    "we considered maser spots at different epochs to be persistent if their positions in the same spectral channel were coincident within 3 @xmath10 @xmath13 yr , where @xmath13 is the time gap between two epochs ; this limit corresponds to a linear motion of less than 85 at a distance of 6 kpc .",
    "data used for parallax and proper motion fits were residual position differences between maser spots and background sources in eastward (= @xmath14 ) and northward (  = @xmath15 ) directions .",
    "the data were modeled as a combination of the parallax sinusoid ( determined by a single parameter , the parallax ) and a linear proper motion for each coordinate . because systematic errors ( owing to small uncompensated atmospheric delays and , in some cases , varying maser and calibrator source structures ) typically dominate over thermal noise when measuring relative source positions , we added `` error floors '' in quadrature to the formal position uncertainties ( see values listed in tables  [ tab : g029a_para_pm ]  [ tab : g031b_para_pm ] ) .",
    "we used independent error floors for the  and  data and adjusted them to yield post - fit residuals with reduced @xmath16 near unity for both coordinates .",
    "the apparent motions of the maser spots can be altered by a combination of spectral blending and changes in intensity .",
    "thus , for parallax fitting , one needs to find stable , unblended spots and preferably use many maser spots to average out any residual effects . to achieve this goal",
    ", we first fitted the position offsets of each maser spot relative to each background source separately and excluded those maser spots with large parallax uncertainties ( @xmath4 40% ) .",
    "since one expects that the parallaxes of all maser spots are identical within measurement uncertainties ( while the proper motions can vary owing to internal motions ) , we did a combined solution fitting a single parallax to all maser spots and background sources , but allowing for different proper motions of the maser spots .",
    "the quoted parallax uncertainty is the formal error multiplied by @xmath17 , where n is the number of maser spots fitted , in order to allow for the possibility of correlated position errors of the maser spots relative to the extragalactic continuum sources .",
    "the position data and the parallax fits are shown in figures  [ fig : g029a_para ]  [ fig : g031b_para ] .    since all maser sources in our observations have simple spectra which span @xmath18 10 , and the proper motions of maser spots ( relative to common or different background sources ) are consistent with each other within @xmath19 ( suggesting that the internal motions are small ) , we estimated the absolute proper motion of the central star exciting the masers by taking the variance - weighted mean of the proper motions .",
    "the uncertainty of the mean proper motion is evaluated using standard error propagation .",
    "details of the measurement of parallaxes and proper motions of the individual sources are presented in the .",
    "the of each source is estimated using the median value of the maser emission velocities , which is consistent with that derived from the gaussian fits of the galactic ring survey ( grs , @xcite )  spectrum .    based on differences between the  of the masers and that indicated by thermal co emission",
    ", we assign a  uncertainty of 3 and 5  for  and  maser sources , respectively .",
    "a similar uncertainty is associated with our estimate of the proper motion of the central star , and we added in quadrature a proper motion uncertainty of 5  ( at the measured distance ) to the measurement uncertainties presented in the .",
    "the measured quantities and fitted parameters and their uncertainties are summarized in table  [ tab : ppm ] .",
    "spiral arms in the galaxy can be identified as large - scale features in longitude - velocity ( @xmath20 ) diagrams from and co surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assigning our masers to arms by associating them with molecular clouds avoids the bias of the alternative method of using the maser distance and a model of spiral structure .",
    "a secure arm assignment requires that the position and velocity of the maser and the molecular cloud be in agreement with the position - velocity ( @xmath20 ) locus of the arm . using the data from the  grs by @xcite and the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy ( atlasgal , )",
    ", we find that all the four sources have good position - velocity correspondence with molecular clouds ( see figure  [ fig : wco ] ) .",
    "the clouds associated with the four maser sources in the w43 complex have angular sizes of @xmath21 3  12 , relatively large composite line widths ( fwhm @xmath21 10 ) , and high positive lsr velocities of @xmath21 95  110 , all of which are consistent with the @xmath20 locus of the scutum spiral arm shown in figure  [ fig : lv ] .",
    "this indicates that the four maser sources in w43 can be confidently located in the scutum spiral arm .      at the kinematic distance of 6 kpc from the sun",
    ", w43 is assumed to be located near the meeting point of the scutum arm and the bar in the galactic plane  .",
    "a solid distance measurement to this region will significantly contribute to our understanding of the physical properties of this star forming complex and the structure of the milky way .    as listed in table  [",
    "tab : ppm ] , the distances and proper motions of the source pairs ,  and , and  and , are consistent within their joint uncertainties .",
    "this suggests that each source pair is located at the same distance .",
    "the variance - weighted average parallax is 0.175 @xmath22 0.014 mas ( 5.71@xmath23 kpc ) and 0.203 @xmath22 0.025 mas ( 4.93@xmath24 kpc ) for the former and latter source pairs , respectively .",
    "since the two source pairs share similar positions and , and have approximately equal distance ( within the uncertainties ) , it is very likely that they belong to the w43 cloud complex .",
    "thus , we estimated a grand average parallax of 0.182 @xmath22 0.012 mas ( 5.49@xmath25 kpc ) to w43 using a variance - weighted average of the four sources .",
    "our measured distance to w43 is in good agreement with the latest spectroscopic distance of 5.2 @xmath22 0.5 kpc by c - h .",
    "r. chen et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , using three o stars .",
    "our measured parallax distance of 5.49 kpc to w43 is about 90% of the previously adopted near kinematic distance of 6 kpc ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this implies that the mass and luminosity of the molecular complex w43 have been overestimated in by factor of 1.2 @xmath22 0.14 .",
    "the revised total h@xmath26 mass from  and cloud mass from  are 5.9 @xmath3 and 3.5 @xmath3 , and the 8 @xmath27 m luminosity becomes 1.32 @xmath28 .      combining the four sources reported here and the twelve sources with parallax measurements in the scutum arm from the bessel survey and the japanese vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) project , makes a total of 16 sources in the scutum arm .",
    "these well delineate a section of the arm with a pitch angle of 201  @xcite . based on the 6.7 ghz  maser population",
    ", @xcite suggested that the inner region of the galaxy contains a thin bar with a length of 3.4 kpc toward a galactocentric azimuth of @xmath21 45  .",
    "figure  [ fig : pec_mot ] shows the location of w43 , together with the newly determined trace of the scutum arm and the long galactic bar .",
    "this suggests that w43 is located close to the meeting point of the scutum arm and the near end of the bar .",
    "three - dimensional motions of maser sources in the galaxy can be derived from their measured parallaxes and proper motions , in combination with their lsr velocities . given values for the galactic parameters @xmath29 ( the distance from the sun to the galactic center ) and @xmath30 ( the rotation speed of the galaxy at the lsr ) , and assuming a rotation curve",
    ", we can estimate the peculiar motions ( i.e. , non - circular motions ) of the masers by subtracting the effects of galactic rotation and peculiar motion of the sun  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the recently derived galactic parameters ( @xmath29 = 8.34 @xmath22 0.15 kpc , @xmath30 = 246 @xmath22 5 ) and the solar motion values (  = 10.5 @xmath22 1.7 ,  = 11.3 @xmath22 2.0 , and  = 8.8 @xmath22 1.0 ) by @xcite ( `` model b1 '' ) , to estimate the peculiar motions of sources in w43 . since the galactocentric distance of w43 is about 4.5 kpc and a flat rotation curve might be not valid inside of 5 kpc from the galactic center , we adopt a non - flat rotation curve @xmath31  for the inner galaxy ( @xmath32 kpc ) , which is adapted from figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the peculiar motions for the four maser sources in w43 listed in table  [ tab : pecmot ] , show that motions out of the galactic plane ( toward the north galactic pole , ) are small , as expected for a massive star - forming region whose galactic orbit should be mainly in the galactic plane . by averaging the results of the four maser sources",
    ", w43 shows a small peculiar motion in the direction of galactic rotation ( ) but a large motion toward the galactic center ( ) . as suggested by @xcite , this non - circular motion toward the galactic center and along the orientation of the galactic bar , is likely induced by the gravitational potential of the central bar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite also suggested that in regions of convergence where the spiral arm bends from the bar , shocks focus gas in the inner parts outward and gas in the outer part inward .",
    "we have measured the parallaxes and proper motions of three 12 ghz methanol maser sources and one 22 ghz water maser source in the massive star - forming complex w43 .",
    "the distances to these sources are accurate to 11% to 18% : @xmath33 kpc for , @xmath34 kpc for , @xmath35 kpc for , @xmath36 kpc for .",
    "all of these sources are consistent with belonging to a single giant molecular cloud , and we derived the distance of w43 to be @xmath37 kpc .",
    "this locates w43 at the meeting point of the scutum arm and the galactic bar . the peculiar motion of w43 is mainly pointing toward the galactic center along the orientation of the galactic bar , which is likely induced by the gravitational attraction of the galactic bar .",
