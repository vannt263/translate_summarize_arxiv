    "the discovery of the nonmagnetic borocarbide superconductor yni@xmath0b@xmath0c@xcite has considerable attention because of the growing evidence for highly anisotropic superconducting gap and high superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 k. the boron isotope effect supports the classification of this material as electron - phonon mediated superconductor.@xcite at an early stage , from specific heat , thermal conductivity , raman scattering and photoemission spectroscopy experiments on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , a highly anisotropic gap function was concluded.@xcite in recent years , maki _",
    "et al._@xcite theoretically suggested that the gap symmetry of this material is @xmath3+@xmath4 wave and the gap function has zero points ( point - nodes ) in momentum space .",
    "motivated by this prediction , field - angle - dependent heat capacity ( fad heat capacity)@xcite and angular variation of the thermal transport ( av thermal transport)@xcite on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c have been measured and these results were considered to be consistent with this prediction .",
    "the fad heat capacity and the av thermal conductivity in @xmath5 rotated within the @xmath6 plane show a fourfold oscillation with narrow cusps because of the presence of nodal quasiparticles subject to doppler shifts .",
    "these results suggest that the gap function has point - nodes along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes",
    ". however , in the analysis of both experiments , the isotropic fermi surface ( fs ) was assumed .",
    "yni@xmath0b@xmath0c has highly anisotropic fermi surfaces ( fss).@xcite    the local density of states ( ldos ) in the isolated vortex of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c was measured at 0.46k by the scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts).@xcite the vortex core was found to be fourfold star - shaped in real space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss](a)-(c ) ) . near @xmath9mev",
    ", the ldos extends toward @xmath10 ( the @xmath7-axis ) and has a peak at the center of the vortex core ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ldoss](a ) ) . with increasing energy , the peak of the ldos splits into four peaks toward @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ldoss](b),(c ) ) .",
    "the anisotropic spatial pattern of the ldos around a vortex core is a consequence of the anisotropic pair - potential and fs .",
    "many theoretical studies have been done since the ldos of nbse@xmath0 can be observed by stm / sts.@xcite we have calculated the ldos pattern around a vortex core of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , assuming that the gap symmetry is @xmath3+@xmath4-wave and the fs is isotropic.@xcite since this result explains the stm results only partly , obviously the calculations of the ldos with a highly anisotropic fs are needed .    the band structure for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c has been calculated , on the basis of the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "et al._@xcite and singh @xcite obtained three bands ( 17th , 18th and 19th ) with mainly ni-3d and y-4d character which cut across the fermi level by using the linearized muffin - tin orbital method and the general potential linearized augmented plane wave method , respectively .",
    "in recent years , band structure calculations were carried out by yamauchi _",
    "et al._,@xcite who are some of the authors , by using a full potential lapw(flapw ) method .",
    "they have carried out lda - based calculations with a certain modification to describe well the experimental fss which are obtained by de haas van alphen effect . in this modification , y - d and ni - d levels",
    "are shifted upward from the original lda levels by 0.11ry and 0.05 ry , respectively .",
    "such the modification have been successful in the fs calculations in lab@xmath11,@xcite ybal@xmath12@xcite and larh@xmath12b@xmath0.@xcite this shift may originate mainly in the self - interaction and/or the non - local corrections to the lda .",
    "they have shown that the density of states from 17th band , which is related to a multiple connected electron fs , has a sharp peak at fermi energy .",
    "this peak comes from a van hove singularity around ( 1/5 , 1/5 , 0 ) point in k - space as we will explain later in this paper .",
    "they have suggested that this singularity may lead large electron- phonon coupling locally , and give rise to anisotropic gap behavior in the superconducting state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the gap structure consistent with the stm / sts , the fad heat capacity and the av thermal transport experiments .",
    "we show the results of four calculations considering the band structure calculations .",
    "first , we calculate the ldos pattern around a single vortex on the basis of the quasiclassical eilenberger theory.@xcite we assume various gap structures , and finally obtain the gap structure which can explain the stm experiment .",
    "second , we calculate the density of states in weak magnetic fields in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane on the basis of the doppler - shift method.@xcite we show that the fad heat capacity and the av thermal transport experiments are consistent with the angular dependence of the density of states from the gap structure consistent with the stm experiment in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "third , we show that the density of states from this gap structure is consistent with the stm experiment in the absence of magnetic fields . as results ,",
    "we show the most suitable gap structure and positions of point - nodes .",

    "since the core states do not contribute to the specific heat in low magnetic fields , we neglect the spatial variation of the magnitude of the pair - potential and consider the spatial variation of the phase of the pair - potential around a vortex .",

    "therefore , the calculations with use of the fss from 17th and 18th bands are needed for quantitative comparison with stm / sts experiment .    the results of stm / sts experiments around a vortex can not be explained by the ` two - gap model since the strong anisotropy of the gap - structure makes the four peak structure of this experiment .",
    "two isotropic gaps make two isotropic ldos patterns even if the highly anisotropic fs is considered . the ldos patterns with the model of point - nodes and that with the two - gap model are qualitatively different in the zero energy region as shown in fig .  [",

    "the previous analyses of the fad heat capacity and the av thermal transport experiments are insufficient since the isotropic fs is assumed , so that these analyses lead to the wrong conclusion that the gap function has point - nodes along the @xmath7 axis and @xmath8 axis .",
    "the information about nodes we obtain is the directions of the fermi velocity at the nodes on the fs , since the doppler - shift method is based on the fact that the energy has the term proportional to @xmath115 as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : doppler ] .",
    "therefore , these experiments suggest that the fermi velocity at the nodes on the fs is parallel to the @xmath7 axis ( the direction of nesting vectors ) . in the case of the anisotropic fs , the directions of the point - nodes are not found only from these experiments . in the only case of the isotropic fs , the directions of the point - nodes are parallel to the fermi velocity at the nodes .",

    "this is a future problem .",
    "in conclusion , we calculated the ldos patterns around a vortex core , the angular dependence of the dos in weak magnetic field , the dos in zero fields in the bulk region and the ldos patterns for the vortex tilting from the crystal @xmath13 axis with use of the fs from 17th band obtained by the band - calculations , assuming various gap structures where positions of point - nodes are different . comparing our theoretical calculations with the results of the stm / sts , the fad heat capacity and the av thermal transport experiments , we determined the gap - structure which is consistent with these experiments .",

    "<S> to determine the superconducting gap function of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , we calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) around a single vortex core with the use of eilenberger theory and the band structure calculated by local density approximation assuming various gap structures with point - nodes at different positions . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the angular - dependent heat capacity in the vortex state on the basis of the doppler - shift method . comparing our results with the stm / sts experiment , the angular - dependent heat capacity and thermal conductivity , we propose the gap - structure of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , which has the point - nodes and gap minima along @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our gap - structure is consistent with all results of angular - resolved experiments . </S>"
