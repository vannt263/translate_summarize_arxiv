    "the continuously growing attention in complex network science resulted over the past years in novel ways of analysis for a great number of complex systems in various scientific fields @xcite .",
    "the fundamental view of this interdisciplinary approach is that large complex systems can be described as complex networks ( or graphs under the mathematics terminology ) where the nodes ( or vertices ) represent the system s interacting elements and the links ( or edges ) represent their interactions .",
    "this unified view was used in the analysis of social @xcite , biological @xcite , physiological @xcite , technological @xcite , climate @xcite , economic @xcite , and financial systems @xcite . in combination with the technological advances that made enormously detailed data available , we are now able to understand and model the evolution of dynamical processes , like epidemic outbreaks and information spreading @xcite .",
    "even the earliest empirical works in this field made clear to researchers that the topology of a network affects its properties .",
    "for example , networks with broad degree distributions are more robust to random failures , but are fragile under intentional attacks @xcite . nowadays",
    ", there is a growing body of literature trying to understand global properties of a network by focusing on properties of individual nodes , and their connectivity patterns @xcite .",
    "of course the role of individual nodes has a profound relation to the evolution of any dynamical process , and to the evolution of the network itself .",
    "for example , very popular individuals in a social network ( i.e. individuals with a large number of connections ) usually attract more attention and increase even more their connectivity .",
    "while it is clear that such processes affect the evolution of the network topology , we can imagine that such individuals could assume key roles in the case of disease spreading etc .",
    "it is clear that questions like _ `` who are the most important nodes in the network ? '' _ are natural to ask .",
    "such questions can be addressed using centrality measures , which are the most frequently used measures when it comes to quantitative network analysis .",
    "however , there is a variety of centrality measures aiming to address the question of node `` importance '' .",
    "for example there is the _ degree centrality _ ( or just the degree of a node , i.e. the number of its links ) , the _ eigenvector centrality _",
    "@xcite , the _ betweenness centrality _",
    "@xcite , the _ closeness centrality _",
    "@xcite , etc . in this work",
    "we focus on a centrality measure based on the notion of @xmath0-cores which is a fundamental concept in graph theory  @xcite when it comes to ranking the centrality of nodes in a complex network .",
    "such ranking was applied in many real networks  @xcite allowing a thorough investigation of their structure , while highlighting the role of various topology - dependent processes .",
    "one major limitation of most centrality measures , including the @xmath0-core decomposition method , is their design to work on unweighted graphs .",
    "however , in practice , real networks are weighted , and their weights describe important and well defined properties of the underlying systems . in a weighted network ,",
    "nodes have ( at least ) two properties that can characterise them , their degree and their weight .",
    "however , since weights are properties of the network s links , the node s weight is calculated as the sum over all link weights passing through a particular node . these two properties , even though in some cases are correlated , are in general independent . as a result",
    ", nodes with high degree can have small weight ( i.e. they have many connections with other nodes but the links of these connections have small weights ) , while there could also be nodes with small degree and high weight .",
    "situations where the weights play important role , occur for example in economic or trade networks . in such networks",
    "the weights are related to some measured property ( like trade flow , capital flow etc . ) , and in many cases one wishes to focus on nodes with high weights that are ( usually ) the most important players .",
    "thus , in such systems the presence of nodes with high degree and relatively small weights may influence the results obtained by methods that are based only on the degree . in such cases two main approaches",
    "have been used , with both having their own drawbacks . under the first approach one",
    "completely neglects the weights and performs the analysis on the unweighted network , but doing so one chooses to neglect an important property of the network .",
    "the second approach would be to consider only links with weights above some - ( usually ) arbitrary chosen - threshold value and filter out the rest .",
    "the drawback of this approach is the selection of a proper cut - off value , which may remove important high degree nodes with links of low weights ( below the threshold ) and as we will discuss later , this could have significant impact on the results .",
    "additionally , by neglecting links below a threshold , the network becomes sparser with some nodes getting disconnected and not considered by the applied method afterwards .",
    "here we aim to overcome these failures by introducing a generalized method for calculating the @xmath0-shell structure of weighted networks .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : first we discuss the standard @xmath0-shell decomposition method , and right after we introduce our generalized version .",
    "next , we apply both methods on real networks and we present their results .",
    "subsequently we compare in more detail the performance of both methods in ranking nodes according to their importance when it comes to spreading processes , and at the end we summarize our conclusions .",
    "-shell decomposition method .",
    "the nodes between the two outer rings include nodes of shell 1 ( @xmath1 ) , while the nodes between the two inner rings compose shell 2 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the nodes within the central ring constitute the core , in this case @xmath3 . ]",
    "the k - core / k - shell decomposition method partitions a network into sub - structures that are directly linked to centrality @xcite .",
    "this method assigns an integer index , @xmath4 , to each node that is representative of the location of the node in the network , according to its connectivity patterns .",
    "nodes with low / high values of @xmath4 are located to the periphery / center of the network .",
    "this way , the network is described by a layered structure ( similar to the structure of an onion ) , revealing the full hierarchy of its nodes .",
    "the innermost nodes belong to the structure called core or `` nucleus '' of the network , while the remaining nodes are placed into more external layers ( @xmath0-shells ) .",
    "a more detailed description of how a network is divided into this @xmath0-shell structure is the following ( see fig  [ fig : gsh.example ] ) .",
    "first one removes recursively from the network all nodes with degree @xmath5 , and we assign the integer value @xmath6 to them .",
    "this procedure is repeated iteratively until there are only nodes with degree @xmath7 left in the network .",
    "subsequently , one removes all nodes with degree @xmath8 and assign to them the integer value @xmath9 .",
    "again , this procedure is repeated iteratively until there are only with nodes with degree @xmath10 left in the network , and so on .",
    "this routine is applied until all nodes of the network have been assigned to one of the @xmath0-shells .",
    "this is how the original @xmath0-shell decomposition method works , which , as described above , does not consider at all the weights of the links ; therefore , from now on we will call it unweighted @xmath0-shell decomposition method ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "here we propose a generalization of the @xmath0-shell decomposition method , that we call weighted @xmath0-shell decomposition method ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this method applies the same pruning routine that was described earlier , but it is based on an alternative measure for the node degree .",
    "this measure considers both the degree of a node and the weights of its links , and we assign for each node a _ weighted degree _ , @xmath13 .",
    "the weighted degree of a node @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta } } ,    \\label{eq : gsh.kprime}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the degree of node @xmath14 , and @xmath17 is the sum over all its link weights . in the present study",
    "we discuss only the case where @xmath18 , which treats the weight and the degree equally .",
    "the full exploration of the parameter space is outside our scope , and is left for future work .",
    "therefore , for what follows @xmath19 .    using the above approach in the case of unweighted networks , where @xmath20 , the weighted degree is equivalent to the node degree ( @xmath21 ) , and we resume the same network partitioning as with the @xmath11 decomposition method .",
    "however , in order that a typical weighted link will be regarded as of unit weight before we calculate @xmath13 using eq .",
    "[ eq : gsh.kprime ] we perform the following steps . first , we normalize all the weights with their mean value @xmath22 , next we divide the resulting weights with their minimum value , and we discretize them by rounding to the closest integer ; this way the minimum link weight is equal to one  .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : gsh.example ] we illustrate schematically the layered structure obtained by applying the @xmath11 decomposition method in a graph . in order to highlight the weaknesses of the unweighted method ,",
    "let us suppose that the network is weighted . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all link weights are equal to one , except for the weight of the link between nodes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is @xmath25 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.example ] , the node @xmath24 is located at the periphery of the network , even though it is strongly connected to one of the core nodes . in real networks",
    "such a strong link ( 3 times the capacity of other links ) means that this particular node is of more importance for the core , but this is not depicted in the layered structured calculated by the classical unweighted approach , since this node will be placed in the outermost shell ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , if we apply the @xmath26 decomposition method , then node @xmath24 is assigned to @xmath9 that is one shell away from the core of the network , highlighting its actual importance .",

    "the shaded area highlights the full range of the degree values in each shell .",
    "the shells are ranked according to their distance from the core , and the error bars are showing the standard deviation .",

    "[ fig : gsh.all ]    in order to compare between the results obtained from the @xmath27 and the @xmath26 decomposition method , we used as case studies the following four real networks :    1 .   _ corporate ownership network _ ( con ) .",
    "this is an economic network linking 206 different countries .",
    "it is constructed  @xcite using the 616000 direct or indirect subsidiaries of the 4000 world corporations with the highest turnover , based on the 2007 version of the orbis database obtained from the _ bureau van dijk electronic publishing _ ( bvdep )  .",
    "the network is weighted , and it s weights represent the business ties among countries  @xcite .",
    "2 .   _ the collaboration network of scientist working in network science _ ( scie ) . this network contains the co - authorship relations of scientists working on network theory and experiment , as compiled by m. newman  @xcite .",
    "the network is weighted , and it s weights are assigned as described in  @xcite .",
    "3 .   _ the neural network of the nematode c. elegans _ ( cel ) .",
    "this network was compiled by d. watts and s. strogatz  @xcite using the original experimental data by white et al  @xcite .",
    "it is a weighted representation of the neural network of c. elegans .",

    "it reports the anonymized list of connected pairs of nodes and the weight associated to the edge , expressed in terms of number of available seats on the given connection on a yearly basis .    in table",
    "[ tab : gsh.netstats ] we provide some detailed statistical properties of the above networks . for our analysis , if not stated otherwise , when we talk about the network we refer to the largest connected component ( lcc ) , and whenever we discuss network properties these are calculated from the lcc .    in table  [",
    "tab : gsh.netcorecomp ] we compare the network hierarchies obtained by applying the @xmath11 and the @xmath26 decomposition method .",
    "we observe that the @xmath26 method yields a more refined partitioning ( larger number of @xmath0-shells ) of the networks .",
    "this means that by applying this method we obtain more detailed information about the networks internal structure , and is similar to using a high resolution microscope to observe small size structures of a larger system .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : gsh.netcorecomp ]    furthermore , for three out of the four studied networks the core obtained with the @xmath26 contains smaller number of nodes , while these nodes are almost entirely part of the core obtained by the @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the weighted method in most cases is able to split further the cores obtained by the unweighted method and to identify which are the _ most central of the central nodes_.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.all ] we plot the degrees of the nodes according to the @xmath0-shell they belong ( expressed as the distance from the core of the network ) .",
    "the node ranking is obtained using the @xmath26 method for all the four different networks described above . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.all ] , the degree is highly ( and non linearly ) correlated with the position of the node in the @xmath0-shell structure , but there are particular cases where the trend is not monotonous .",
    "this means that there are nodes with high degree that may not be as central to the network as one would expect ; this is in line with our discussion for the example network of fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.example ] .",
    "next we compare the core of the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 decomposition methods applied on the global corporate ownership network ( con ) studied in  @xcite .",
    "the con connects 206 countries around the globe , using as links the ownership relations within large companies .",
    "if companies listed in country a have subsidiary corporations in country b , there is a link connecting these two countries directed from country a to country b. the weight of the link , @xmath33 , equals the number of the subsidiary corporations in country b controlled by companies of country a.    using the @xmath11 decomposition method , as shown in table  [ tab : gsh.netcorecomp ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.con.coresize ] , we identify a core of 41 countries .",
    "however we expect that in the current state of the global economy a smaller set of countries are the major players ( g8 , g20 , etc ) . in order to reduce the size of the core , and to highlight which are the potentially more important nodes of this network by using the classic @xmath0-shell decomposition method , a cut - off value of @xmath34 was assumed in garas et al  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the remaining network after filtering the links with @xmath35 contains only 66 out of the original 206 nodes . however",
    ", a core formed by the following 12 countries : united states of america ( us ) , united kingdom ( gb ) , france ( fr ) , germany ( de ) , netherlands ( nl ) , japan ( jp ) , sweden ( se ) , italy ( it ) , switzerland ( ch ) , spain ( es ) , belgium ( be ) , and luxembourg ( lu ) was identified . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.con.coresize ] the evolution of the core and network size of the con is shown , as a function of the weight cut - off value @xmath36 .    using the @xmath26 decomposition method we obtain the layered structure of the network including all the 206 nodes , without using any arbitrary cut - off parameter .",
    "the core of the network obtained with this method consists of the following 11 counties : united states of america ( us ) , united kingdom ( gb ) , france ( fr ) , germany ( de ) , netherlands ( nl ) , japan ( jp ) , canada ( ca ) , italy ( it ) , switzerland ( ch ) , spain ( es ) , and belgium ( be ) . comparing these two cores we find a striking similarity .",
    "the only two differences are the presence of canada ( ca ) in the core calculated using our new weighted @xmath0-shell approach while sweden ( se ) and luxembourg ( lu ) have moved to the second innermost layer .",
    "these differences can be well understood , considering that ca is a major economy , it is part of g7 , and all the other six members of g7 are already part of the core .",
    "furthermore , ca outperforms se and lu in terms of population and other macroeconomic indicators , such as total import / exports and gdp .",
    "it is thus natural to conclude that the core obtained using the @xmath26 decomposition method is more meaningful from an economics perspective , since it groups together some of the largest ( developed ) global economies .",
    "recently models like the susceptible - infectious - recovered ( sir ) model  @xcite have been used extensively in network research in order to explore epidemic spreading  @xcite , economic crisis spreading  @xcite as well as information and rumor spreading  @xcite in social processes . however , in such processes the topology of the network is not the only thing that matters ; the position of the node where the spreading begins plays an important role as well . in the resent work of kitsak",
    "et al  @xcite it was shown that the spreading power of a node can not be predicted solely based on its degree .",
    "a better measure is its actual position in the network , as it is described by the @xmath0-shell where it belongs .    using this perspective",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that a @xmath0-shell partitioning method provides us with a more accurate node ranking for representing the nodes spreading power .",
    "additionally , since the individual nodes are grouped in @xmath0-shells , it is reasonable to assume that every @xmath0-shell should contain nodes with similar spreading power . in",
    "what follows we will use these assumptions to evaluate and compare the performance of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decomposition methods .",
    "we modeled spreading process by applying the sir model on all the networks described above .",
    "however , since we are interested in the weights of the network , we used a version of the sir model which takes into account the weight of the links that mediate the spreading . this model was originally introduced to simulate the spreading of an economic crisis  @xcite ; for this model the probability of infection is different for every link and is calculated by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the weight of the link that connects the origin node @xmath14 with the destination node @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the total weight ( @xmath41 ) of the destination node @xmath39 .",
    "the factor @xmath42 is a free amplification parameter that can determine for example the severity of a crisis , how infectious a virus is , the importance of a rumor etc .",
    "in what follows we will call this model _ weighted sir _",
    "( w - sir ) .",
    "-shell versus the shell s distance from the core of the network .",
    "]    -shell over all shells , @xmath43 , versus @xmath42 . ]",
    "the modeling procedure of the w - sir is the following .",
    "initially we assign all nodes to be susceptible ( s ) to an infection .",
    "next , one node , @xmath14 , is chosen and is assumed to be infected ( i ) .",
    "this node will infect all its neighboring nodes with probability @xmath44 during the first time step .",
    "this causes all infected nodes to switch their status from s to i , while the node that initiated this process changes to the recovered state ( r ) , and can no longer infect other nodes or become infected . at every consecutive time step the process is repeated , and all the infected nodes are trying to infect their susceptible ( s ) neighbors in the network .",
    "the process lasts until there are no infected nodes left in the network .    for each individual node we performed 100 realizations of the w - sir model , and we calculated the average infected fraction of the network for different values of @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "this fraction is used as score in order to rank the nodes according to their spreading potential .",
    "we restricted ourselves to values of @xmath42 in this interval , as for much larger @xmath42 values the role of individual nodes is no longer important , and an epidemic outbreak emerges no matter where the infection starts .",
    "next , we partitioned the network using the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 decomposition methods , and ranked the obtained @xmath0-shells according to their distance from the core . by calculating the average infected fraction that results from an epidemic starting separately from all nodes of every individual @xmath0-shell",
    ", we estimated the shell s spreading potential .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.wsir - all ] we study how the average infected fraction changes versus the distance of each @xmath0-shell from the core of the network for both methods .",
    "we find that , in general , the central @xmath0-shells obtained by the @xmath26 method are more able to initiate a severe outbreak in comparison to the central @xmath0-shells obtained using the @xmath11 method .",
    "this result is robust for all networks used in this study , and for different values of the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the above finding means that the @xmath26 decomposition method positions the nodes with the higher average spreading potential in shells closer to the core .",
    "next , we tested how homogeneous are the obtained @xmath0-shells with respect to the spreading potential of their containing nodes . in order to do so , we calculated the standard deviation , @xmath46 , of a node s infected fraction ( spreading potential ) for every @xmath0-shell for a given value of the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "next we calculated the average value over all the shells , @xmath43 , and we plot it versus @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.wsir - sd ] ) .",
    "we find that the average standard deviation of the spreading potential using w - sir is always lower when we partition the network using the @xmath26 method , with respect to partitioning using the @xmath11 method .",
    "this means that the @xmath26 method gives more _ homogeneous @xmath0-shells _ , where all nodes in the shell have similar importance for the dynamical process in question .     versus @xmath42 for two different configurations of the con .",
    "@xmath26 - w - sir is the original case ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.wsir - sd ] ) where the nodes spreading potential is obtained by applying the w - sir in the original network .",
    "@xmath26 - ( sh)w - sir is a case where we calculated the nodes spreading potential by applying the w - sir on the 10 realizations of the con with shuffled weights . ]    as a final step , and given that the @xmath26 method performs better in positioning the nodes according to their w - sir spreading potential in weighted graphs , it is interesting to further explore the role of the weights in this process .",
    "to do so , we created 10 realizations of the con network with shuffled weights , and we performed 100 runs of the w - sir model on every one of these 10 networks .",
    "next , we calculated the average spreading potential per @xmath0-shell using the infected fraction obtained by the implementation of w - sir on the network with shuffled weights .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsh.con.sh ] , in the shuffled case the @xmath0-shells are becoming significantly more inhomogeneous , and their @xmath43 is always larger that the @xmath43 obtained by the original , unshuffled network .",
    "this procedure highlights the role of the weights in the process , since in the case where the weights do not to play any role these two curves should collapse into one .",
    "in summary , we presented a generalized @xmath0-shell decomposition method ( @xmath26 ) that considers the link weights of networks , without applying any arbitrary cut - off threshold on their value .",
    "the method resumes the same shell structure obtained by the classic @xmath0-shell decomposition in the absence of weights , but when weights are present , it is able to partition the network in a more refined way . in it s general formulation , our method allows us to vary the importance assigned to either the node weights or the node degree , by adjusting the exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 of eq .",
    "[ eq : gsh.kprime ] .",
    "whilst in the current work we did not fully explore the parameter space , we would like to stress that this additional flexibility provides a more accurate ranking for various applications . here",
    ", using @xmath18 we showed that the partitioning obtained by the @xmath26 method is particularly meaningful in terms of the spreading potential of the nodes .",
    "we demonstrated the weighted version of the sir model in four different networks , and showed that nodes with higher spreading potential were positioned in the core or in shells closer to the core , better in comparison with the @xmath11 method .",
