    "the recent discovery of na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4 o superconductor @xcite has renewed interest in the study of exotic superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "motivated by the triangular lattice structure of spin-@xmath6 co atoms of the reference coo@xmath4 layer , several authors @xcite have quickly proposed that it might be a realization of the long sought spin - liquid based superconductivity , originally proposed for high - t@xmath7 superconductors by anderson et al.@xcite .",
    "indeed several theoretical calculations @xcite indicate that the frustration of the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) on the triangular lattice of co favors the d+id superconducting symmetry .    for a new superconducting material ,",
    "the first step toward laying down the theory of the superconducting state is the experimental identification of the sc gap symmetry .",
    "nuclear spin - lattice relation rate 1/t@xmath1 and knight shift measurements have been the successful tools for this purpose and several measurements of 1/t@xmath1 and knight shift of this compound have already been reported . at present , however , these reports appear inconsistent with each other . regarding the coherence peak of co@xmath5 1/t@xmath1 , for example",
    ", kobayashi et al .",
    "@xcite and waki et al .",
    "@xcite reported the existence of a coherence peak ; the maximum value of 1/t@xmath1 t is about 1.1 to 1.5 times of the normal state value while an ideal s - wave case has almost twice of the normal state value@xcite .",
    "however , fujimoto et al .",
    "@xcite recently reported no coherence peak .",
    "furthermore , they reported more precise @xmath5 co 1/t@xmath1 below t@xmath7 and found a substantial region of linear temperature dependence in 1/t@xmath1 at low temperatures and t@xmath8 behavior near and below t@xmath7 . to fit their data a residual density of states ( dos ) of 0.65n(0 ) was needed assuming an impure d - wave sc state . from this calculation",
    ", these authors concluded that the non s - wave gap with the lines of nodes is most consistent with their 1/t@xmath1 data and the compatibility of the d+id symmetry gap having a full gap remains as a question .    in this note",
    ", we calculated 1/t@xmath1 for d+id gap with impurities using self - consistent t - matrix approximation and quantitatively compared our results with experiments reported up to date .",
    "since the impurity effects on various symmetry gaps has been studied by many authors @xcite and the generic behaviors are well known , we summarize them . within t - matrix approximation ,",
    "the impurity scattering renormalizes the self - energies both of normal and anomalous components . in nambu notation",
    ", they correspond to @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively ; @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the two separate components of the normal self - energy according to particle - hole transformation and @xmath12 is the anomalous self - energy component . among them , the renormalization of @xmath10 usually vanishes for particle - hole symmetric band , which is a good approximation for most cases . for an isotropic s - wave gap ,",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are renormalized and their effects largely cancel each other in the renormalized gap equation ; as a result the impurity effect is null for low temperature sc properties such as the changes of the order parameter ( op ) magnitude ( @xmath13 ) and t@xmath7 , and the residual dos etc . for a sign changing op such as the d - wave gap",
    ", the renormalization of @xmath12 vanishes , too , due to symmetry , and the impurity effects appear only in the renormalization of @xmath11 the normal self - energy .",
    "the case of d+id gap is interesting in that it has a full gap all over the fs and should display similar thermodynamic behaviors as in an isotropic s - wave gap .",
    "however , regarding the impurity effects , it is expected to show a mixed behavior of a d - wave gap and a s - wave gap because the sign changing op leads to a vanishing @xmath12 renormalization despite a full gap .",
    "we find that for unitary impurities the residual dos is created in the d+id gap as easily as in the d - wave gap .",
    "this happens because the resonant scattering process of unitary impurity is more efficient at lower dos . as a result ,",
    "d+id gap displays a similar t - linear behavior in 1/t@xmath1 at low temperatures with the same amount of unitary impurities as in the simple d - wave case .",
    "therefore , the observation of the t - linear behavior in 1/t@xmath1 at low temperatures@xcite itself can not rule out the d+id symmetry gap on coo@xmath4 superconductor . moreover , in contrast to the d - wave gap the d+id gap with a smaller amount of impurities displays a reduced coherence peak reflecting full opening of the gap around the fs .",
    "putting together our theoretical results , we conclude that the d+id symmetry gap with unitary impurities provides the most consistent agreement with the currently available nuclear spin - lattice relaxation data .",
    "we also studied the effects of born limit impurity on both symmetry gaps .",
    "we find that the response to born limit impurities is qualitatively different for d+id and d - wave symmetry gaps , and both cases can not fit the experimental data .",
    "the effect of the impurity scattering is included with t - matrix approximation@xcite . as we explained above , for sign - changing op and assuming particle - hole symmetric band , we just need to calculate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 the normal dos at the fermi energy , @xmath17 the impurity concentration .",
    "@xmath18 is defined in matsubara frequency as @xmath19},\\ ] ] and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the scattering strength parameter @xmath22 is related to the s - wave phase shift @xmath23 as @xmath24 . with this @xmath18",
    "the following gap equation is solved self - consistently . @xmath25 for d+id gap equation , we assume the pairing potential @xmath26 to be a constant because thermodynamic properties of d+id sc are determined by the absolute magnitude of the gap @xmath27 which is the same as the isotropic s - wave gap .",
    "the property of the d+id gap in the above gap equation manifests itself only as the absence of @xmath12 renormalization . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the d - wave case with a proper pairing potential @xcite , which also has no @xmath12 renormalization due to the sign - changing op .",
    "the only technical difference of the impurity effects on d+id- and d - wave symmetry gaps is the normal self - energy correction due to impurities in the sc states with a full gap and lines of nodes in the gap , respectively .    with the gap function @xmath28 and @xmath29 obtained from eq.(1 ) ( @xmath29 is analytically continued from @xmath30 by pad approximant method ) , we calculate the @xmath0 nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xcite @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 means the average over the fs . the first term in the bracket of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is @xmath34 .",
    "the second term vanishes in our calculations because of the symmetry of the op . to calculate @xmath35 using eq.(4 ) , we need the full temperature dependence of the gap function @xmath28 .",
    "the gap equation eq .",
    "( 3 ) is basically the bcs gap equation , therefore it gives the bcs temperature dependence for @xmath28 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the d+id- and d - wave gap solutions , respectively .",
    "we use the phenomenological formula , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 , with parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is similarly extrapolated : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the normal state @xmath18 .",
    "then we only need to calculate @xmath28 and @xmath18 at zero temperature .",
    "in our numerical calculation , the bcs value @xmath46 and the ratio @xmath47 for d+id gap and @xmath48 for d - wave gap are used , respectively . note that the final results are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath40 .",
    "fig.1(a ) shows the normalized nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/t@xmath1 for d+id sc gap with varying impurity concentration of unitary impurities ( c=0 ) .",
    "the normalization is chosen so that the value of 1/t@xmath1 at t@xmath7 is 100 in arbitrary units .",
    "the experimental data ( black circles ) are also normalized in the same fashion .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding dos .",
    "the key result we find is that although d+id gap develops a full gap as in an isotropic s - wave gap , the unitary impurity scattering produces resonance states inside the gap ( at @xmath49 in our case of c=0 and a particle - hole symmetric band ) . a finite amount of unitary impurities ,",
    "therefore , quickly produces a residual dos around @xmath49 inside the gap . as a result ,",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/t@xmath1 develops a growing t - linear region at low temperatures with increasing impurity concentration .",
    "the high - temperature 1/t@xmath1 below t@xmath7 initially follows the pure d+id curve ( black open squares ) with a small amount of impurities , but with increasing impurity concentration it follows a nongeneric power law dependence @xcite . with the impurity concentration of @xmath50 ( @xmath13 is the absolute magnitude of the pure d+id gap at zero temperature ) , the residual dos at @xmath49 n(0 )",
    "is about 0.63 n@xmath51 ( n@xmath51 is the normal state dos at fermi level ) .",
    "compared with the experimental data of @xmath5co 1/t@xmath1 from t. fujimoto et al .",
    "( ref.[8 ] ) it provides a reasonably good fit : the low temperature t - linear behavior and its magnitude , the high temperature power law ( experimental fit was t@xmath52 ) , and the absence of the coherence peak .",
    "therefore , the experimental observation of the substantial region of t - linear behavior @xcite in @xmath5co 1/t@xmath1 of na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4 o does nt rule out the possibility of d+id gap in this compound .",
    "furthermore , our calculations for d+id gap provide a resolution for the conflicting observation of the coherence peak by other groups @xcite .",
    "first , without impurities ( black open squares ) the height of the coherence peak is about 1.46 times of the value of 1/t@xmath1 at t@xmath7 , which is a little smaller than the value for isotropic s - wave case .",
    "this is because the second term in eq.(4 ) vanishes due to the symmetry of the d+id op . with impurities the coherence peak",
    "is quickly suppressed and there is a small peak visible with a smaller amount of impurities ( for example , see @xmath53 ( open purple squares ) ; note the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "we notice that there is a systematic trend of the height of the coherence peak with t@xmath7 of the samples used for @xmath5co 1/t@xmath1 measurement : no coherence peak with t@xmath7=3.9 k @xcite ; coherence peak with height 1.1 times of the value of 1/t@xmath1 at t@xmath7 with t@xmath7=4.5 k @xcite ; coherence peak height 1.4 times of the value of 1/t@xmath1 at t@xmath7 with t@xmath7=5.0 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can understand the seemingly inconsistent experimental reports on @xmath5co 1/t@xmath1 by different groups with d+id gap and as a result of the different samples with different scattering rates@xcite .",
    "we also show the d - wave results with unitary impurities ( c=0 ) in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the overall shape of dos for d - wave gap with and without impurities is qualitatively different from the case of d+id gap .",
    "nevertheless , the accumulation of the residual dos n(0 ) with impurities are very similar in magnitude , which is the main property determining the low temperature 1/t@xmath1 behavior . as a result",
    ", we can also fit the data of fujimoto et al . with a d - wave gap with a similar amount of impurities ( the necessary @xmath54 value should be between 0.32 and 0.16 , see fig.1(b ) ) ; the residual dos n(0 ) with @xmath55=0.32 is about 0.73 n@xmath51 .",
    "however , the d - wave results can not explain the observation of the coherence peak seen by some experimental groups @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we show the same calculations in the born limit ( c=1 ) in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) .",
    "both d+id and d - wave gaps with born limit impurities does nt produce a close fit to the experimental data unless @xmath56 .",
    "even with @xmath57 , the detailed line shape of the calculated 1/t@xmath1 does nt quite fit the experimental data for both gaps .",
    "moreover , the reduction of t@xmath7 and the gap magnitude @xmath13 with @xmath58 is about 50 @xmath59 or more for both gap cases , which is not consistent with experiments .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/t@xmath1 for both d+id- and d - wave superconducting states with impurities .",
    "we found that unitary impurities produce the residual density of states inside the gap due to the resonant scattering for both cases .",
    "interestingly , we found that the rate of accumulation of the residual density of states with unitary impurities is similar for both sc gaps . as a result ,",
    "both d+id and d - wave gaps produce the t - linear behavior in 1/t@xmath1 at low temperatures and can fit the experimental data of fujimoto et al .",
    "@xcite with the unitary impurity concentration of @xmath60 . however , considering observations of the coherence peak in @xmath5co 1/t@xmath1 by other groups @xcite and a systematic trend of the height of the coherence peak with t@xmath7 of the samples , we conclude that the d+id symmetry gap is the most consistent with the currently available nuclear spin - lattice relaxation data of na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4 o.",
