    "certain characters in the harry potter adventures have the magical power to move from one room to another without having to go through the staircase in between @xcite . even without resorting to magic and wizardry , something quite similar",
    "can be brought to pass in the quantum world : among three adjacent potential wells @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , a particle in well @xmath0 at one end can be transferred to the non - adjacent well @xmath2 at the other end without bypassing or occupying the well @xmath1 , that lies in between .",
    "the principle behind such a transfer has been well established for quite some time in the context of internal atomic states for a two - photon process known as stirap ( stimulated raman adiabatic pumping ) @xcite , wherein atoms are pumped from a state @xmath0 in their electronic ground - state manifold to another state @xmath2 in the same manifold by means of a pair of time varying laser fields that couple @xmath0 and @xmath2 to an excited state @xmath1 .",
    "the idea can be applied to other similar manifestations of discrete quantum states ; specifically when those states represent the spatial wavefunctions of physical particles , one can achieve the seemingly magical transport between two locations without traversing the intervening space .",
    "the last few years have witnessed a surge of theoretical interest in applying the stirap principle to spatial transport of physical particles in a variety of systems : atoms in optical microtraps @xcite , electrons in quantum dots @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , superconductors @xcite , spin transport in the context of quantum information @xcite .",
    "experimental demonstration was achieved for photons in optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "even a new acronym ctap ( coherent tunneling via adiabatic passage ) has been coined to describe the spatial analog @xcite .",
    "the popular theoretical description of the process is borrowed from quantum optics , and is in terms of a discrete @xmath3 hamiltonian matrix with variable off - diagonal elements corresponding to the coupling between the traps . here",
    ", we adopt a more flexible approach , appropriate for spatial transfer , where the evolution is described by a time dependent schrdinger equation for the appropriate potentials forming the wells and the barriers .",
    "the advantage of such a method lies in its capability to model arbitrary potential shapes and variations accurately @xcite .",
    ", @xmath1 , and @xmath2 of length @xmath4 are separated by two delta - function barriers of strengths @xmath5 .",
    "the potential of the middle well is set to 0 , the outer wells @xmath0 and @xmath2 have variable potentials @xmath6 . [ fig1 ] ]    regardless of the method used , results on such adiabatic transfer have been numerical in nature , with the tradeoff that the parametric dependencies of the transfer process are hard to identify .",
    "our goal in this paper is to obtain simple analytical conditions for the system parameters by considering a somewhat simplified triple - well model which captures the essential features of more complex potentials .",
    "we find that in order to have a vanishing population of the central well at all times certain supplementary conditions need to be satisfied : first , out of the three lowest - energy and relevant eigenstates of the hamiltonian , the middle - energy one should maintain as low a population of well @xmath1 as possible , which can be achieved by requiring its node to be at the center of well @xmath1 .",
    "secondly the energy eigenvalues of the instantaneous hamiltonian need to be manipulated in such a way that the process stays in the adiabatic regime , which can be achieved by keeping the energy of the middle state as far from the adjacent states as possible .",
    "we show that the implementation of these conditions necessitate the manipulation of the well depths as well as the barrier heights .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the conditions for keeping the central well population negligible at all times in the limiting case of delta - function potential barriers , and in sec .",
    "iii we show that those conditions apply for finite width barriers that are narrow and high at all times , and also qualitatively for wider barriers .",
    "these conditions are applied in a numerical simulation based on a time - dependent schrdinger equation in sec .",
    "iv to demonstrate the validity of our conditions . in sec .",
    "vi , we provide an interpretation of the transfer process in terms of a high velocity current , and summarize our results in the conclusions section .",
    "in stirap the transfer is achieved by using a counterintuitive coupling sequence , where @xmath1 is first coupled to the empty target state @xmath2 , and only when that coupling is reduced , the @xmath7 coupling is ramped up .",
    "appropriate adiabatic variation of the two couplings map the state @xmath1 to a dark state superposition of states @xmath0 and @xmath2 , which contains no contribution of state @xmath1",
    ". the name ` dark state ' refers to the fact that atoms in this superposition can not interact with the laser fields . by gradually switching off the @xmath7 coupling , the dark state is adiabatically transformed into @xmath2 . during the process",
    ", there is virtually no occupation of the intermediate state @xmath1 which would spontaneously decay into one of lower energy states .    in the spatial analog , the three states are implemented by three adjacent potential wells with the _ inverse _ strengths of the two intra - well barriers signifying the coupling between the wells .",
    "we implement this process by considering a one dimensional system with the potential energy structure as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath8 where each well spans a length @xmath4 in the intervals @xmath9 , b\\equiv\\left [ -\\frac{1}{2}l ; \\frac{1}{2}l\\right ] ,   c\\equiv\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}l ; \\frac{3}{2}l\\right]$ ] .",
    "effective 1d behavior can be implemented for atoms in micro - magnetic traps @xcite with tight transverse confinement , and for electrons in size - quantized nanowires @xcite .",
    "the delta - potentials are idealizations of narrow and high potential barriers , which can be implemented with tightly focused lasers for ultracold atoms , or sharp field - gradient between adjacent quantum dots in the case of electrons .",
    "the potential energy shifts @xmath6 are analogs of detuning among internal atomic states @xcite . denoting the fundamental wavevector for an infinite square well of length @xmath4 by @xmath10 for a state with wavelength @xmath11",
    ", we define the dimensionless coupling parameters @xmath12 for the _ inverse_-strengths of delta - function potentials , and @xmath13 for the constant energy shifts of the two outer wells : @xmath14 consistent with the assumption of high barriers , we assume @xmath15 during the whole process so that only the lowest orders of @xmath12 need to be considered .    the initial conditions , along with the adiabaticity , can ensure that only the three lowest energy states of the instantaneous hamiltonian are energetically accessible and relevant ; we denote the states by @xmath16 ( ground ) , @xmath17 ( dark ) , and @xmath18 ( excited ) , in order of increasing energy .",
    "we study their properties below to extract conditions on the system parameters .",
    "the middle - energy eigenstate plays the crucial role in the ctap time evolution , by evolving as a dark state with little contribution from the central well , b. in order to minimize the population of well @xmath1 , we assume a symmetric form of the middle - energy eigenstate @xmath19 , & x\\in a \\\\     b_d\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{l}}\\sin   \\left[k_0(1-y_b)x \\right ] , & x\\in b \\\\    c_d\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{l}}\\cos \\left[k_0(1-y_c)x+ \\frac{3\\pi}{2}y_c \\right ] , & x\\in c\\\\   \\end{array }   \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the small parameters @xmath20 correspond to phase shifts of the infinite well wavevector due to the finite heights and widths of the intermediate barriers .",
    "the conditions of continuity of @xmath17 at @xmath21 , on retaining only terms linear in @xmath22 lead to the relations @xmath23 the time - independent schrdinger equation applied at the positions of the delta walls leads to the requirements @xmath24 and applied within the wells , gives @xmath25 from which it follows that @xmath26 up to first order in @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the condition connecting the potentials of the walls to the inverse barrier strengths : @xmath27 this relation underscores the fact that slight shifts in the potential wells are essential to minimize the population of the central well , and the optimal shifts need to be varied synchronously with the barrier potentials between the wells .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied then the dark state does not have the node in the middle of the central well , instead the node is closer to ( or inside of ) one or the other of the two walls , which due the heightened asymmetry , increases the net probability of the particle to be in the central well .",

    "this assumes that the barrier heights are always kept high , forcing the parameters @xmath12 to be always small . in that case , the population of the middle well , @xmath31 can be made arbitrary small compared to the other two wells , since the numerator of @xmath32 is bilinear in the small parameters , but the numerators of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are linear , while they all share the same denominator which is effectively of linear order in the small parameters .",
    "it is clear from the expressions that by changing the ratio of the magnitudes of the barriers and therefore @xmath35 the population ratio of wells @xmath0 and @xmath2 can vary as the squares , @xmath36 , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",

    "the continuity of @xmath43 at @xmath21 leads to the conditions @xmath44 the stationary schrdinger equation applied at the position of the delta walls leads to the requirements @xmath45 while energy eigenvalues in the wells lead to a condition identical to eq .",
