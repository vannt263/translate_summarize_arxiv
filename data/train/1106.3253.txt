    "and @xmath3.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    supersymmetry is surely one of the best motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , it is well known that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) suffers for at least two phenomenological problems : on the one hand the mssm predicts @xmath4 as upper bound for the lightest higgs boson mass at tree level , in potential conflict with the lep ii lower bound @xmath5 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mssm general flavour structure predicts signals potentially in conflict with the present good agreement between the sm prediction and the data .",
    "as is well known , the first problem is a naturalness problem : the sensitivity of the fermi scale on the average stop mass makes unnatural to raise the mass of the lightest higgs boson much above the tree level upper bound @xcite-@xcite . at the same time , the flavour problem can be solved ( or at least ameliorated ) allowing the masses of the first two generations of squarks to be heavy enough to suppress unwanted signals @xcite . up",
    "to which value they can be pushed can be a naturalness problem as well , so that we argue in favour of a view in which the two issues , the `` higgs problem '' and the `` flavour problem '' may be related naturalness problems .",
    "+ to be more precise , the more stringent bounds on the masses of the squarks of the first two generations come from the @xmath6 transitions , both real and especially imaginary @xcite ; demanding only for heavy squark masses , one ends up with masses of the order of hundreds of tev , while demanding also for degeneracy and alignment between the first two generations of order of the cabibbo angle , the lower bounds are relaxed : _",
    "i.e. _ assuming @xmath7 ( where , according to the standard notation , @xmath8 and ll , rr and lr refers to left and right sector , respectively ) and @xmath9 we have ( for details , see @xcite ) @xmath10 let us now formulate in equations our starting point : the two naturalness bounds ( where @xmath11 is the amount of fine - tuning and @xmath12 is the average stop mass ) @xcite @xmath13 must be considered together .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : naturalness_bounds ] ) that increasing the higgs boson mass goes in the direction of relaxing any naturalness bound , so that it is conceivable to have squarks of the first two generations with masses high enough to solve the flavour problem without introducing too much fine - tuning . in summary , we seek for models in which the spectrum of fig . [",
    "fig : spettro ] can be realized in a natural manner .",
    "+ extensions of the mssm that allow for a significant increase of the higgs boson mass have been studied in the literature ; a representative set is the following :    * _ extra @xmath14 factor _ @xcite .",
    "the mssm gauge group is extended to include an additional @xmath15 factor with coupling @xmath16 and charge @xmath17 of the two standard higgs doublet .",
    "the extra gauge factor is broken by two extra scalars , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at a scale significantly higher than @xmath20 .",
    "the tree level upper bound on the mass of the lightest scalar becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the masses of the gauge boson and the soft breaking mass of @xmath18 and @xmath19 taken approximately degenerate .",
    "* _ extra @xmath24 factor _ @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the extended gage group is now @xmath25 where the two @xmath24 gauge groups are broken down to the diagonal subgroup by a chiral bidoublet @xmath26 at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "the upper bound on the mass of the higgs boson is now @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gauge coupling associated to @xmath29 , @xmath30 the soft breaking mass of the @xmath26 scalar and @xmath22 the mass of the quasi degenerate heavy gauge triplet vectors . *",
    "_ @xmath31susy _ @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is the nmssm @xcite with a largish coupling @xmath31 between the singlet and the two higgs doublets .",
    "the upper bound in this case is @xmath32    fig .",
    "[ fig : max_mh ] shows the maximal value of @xmath33 in the three different cases ( @xmath34 in the extra - gauge cases and low @xmath35 for @xmath31susy ) as a function of the scale at which the relevant coupling becomes semi - perturbative .     as a function of the scale @xmath36 where some couplings become semi - perturbative in the three different cases : extra @xmath14 ( dotdashed ) , @xmath31susy ( solid ) and @xmath24 ( dashed).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "we can now discuss what happens to the naturalness bounds of eqs.([eq : naturalness_bounds ] ) once we raise the higgs boson mass .",
    "first of all , the bound on the stop mass is relaxed , but now its value is no longer relevant for the `` higgs boson problem '' , since the mass of the lightest higgs boson is above the lep bound already at tree level . concerning the bound on the mass of the squarks of the first two generations , fig .",
    "[ fig : naturalness_plot ] shows the comparison between the mssm ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and @xmath31susy ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , assuming a common mass @xmath41 at the scale @xmath42 at which the rge flow begins ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not show the analogous plot for the two gauge extensions since the bounds are much stronger than the mssm case .",
    "+ a complementary issue we have to care about is colour conservation , since the large values of the masses of the squarks of the first two generations can drive to negative values the squared mass of the third one @xcite . to properly analyse the problem , we proceed as follows : first of all we take a value of @xmath43 at @xmath42 that gives at most a @xmath44 fine - tuning on the fermi scale",
    "; we then demand the running due to the squarks of the first two generation not to drive @xmath43 to negative values .",
    "the upper bounds on @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colour_plot ] for different values of the gluino mass , in the mssm ( left panel ) and @xmath31susy ( right panel ) , for @xmath46 and @xmath39 respectively . as can be seen , they are similar or weaker than the corresponding bounds obtained from naturalness considerations .",
    "we considered the possibility of regarding the `` higgs boson problem '' and the `` supersymmetric flavour problem '' as related naturalness problems , giving attention to models in which the higgs boson mass is increased already at tree level . among the considered possibilities",
    ", we found that in @xmath31susy @xcite an higgs boson mass of @xmath47 allows to raise the masses of the squarks of the first two generations up to @xmath48 without introducing too much fine - tuning , softening in this way the supersymmetric flavour problem . among the main phenomenological consequences ,",
    "it is interesting to stress the possibility of detecting the golden decay mode @xmath49 in association to typical supersymmetric signals due to multi - top final states .",
    "regarding the dm , and focusing on a bino / higgsino lsp , the effect of an increased higgs boson mass is twofold : on the one hand the `` well - temperament '' pointed out in @xcite is completely disrupted ; on the other hand , only a small portion of parameter space is constrained by direct detection experiments , since the cross section falls off as @xmath50 .",
