    "in the last years there has been an intense theoretical and experimental debate about the nature of the @xmath2 meson , mostly centered on the discussion about its interpretation as an ordinary @xmath3 meson or a @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the advent of @xmath5 showed up that the @xmath1 interaction in s - wave in the isoscalar sector is strong enough to generate a resonance through multiple scattering of the pions .",
    "this seems to be the case , and even in models starting with a seed of @xmath3 states , the incorporation of the @xmath1 channels in a unitary approach leads to a large dressing by a pion cloud which makes negligible the effects of the original @xmath3 seed .",
    "this idea has been made more quantitative through the introduction of the unitary extensions of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "even more challenging is the modification of the properties of the @xmath2 meson at finite nuclear density .",
    "since present theoretical calculations agree on a sizeable modification in the nuclear medium of the @xmath7 scattering in the @xmath2 region our purpose here is to find out its possible experimental signature in a very suited process like the @xmath8 reaction in nuclei .",
    "( this contribution is a summary of the more extended work @xcite ) .",
    "this reaction is much better suited than the @xmath9 one to investigate the modification of the @xmath7 in nuclear matter because the photons are not distorted by the nucleus and the reaction can test higher densities .",
    "for the model of the elementary @xmath10 reaction we follow @xcite which considers the coupling of the photons to mesons , nucleons , and the resonances @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this model relies upon tree level diagrams .",
    "final state interaction of the @xmath15 system is accounted for by means of the explicit use of resonances with their widths .",
    "however , since we do not include explicitly the @xmath2 resonance , the final state interaction of the two pions has to be implemented to generate it",
    ".    the @xmath16 amplitude can be decomposed in a part which has in the final state the combination of pions in isospin i=0 and another part where the pions are in i=2 .",
    "@xmath17    the renormalization of the @xmath18 @xmath19 amplitude is done by factorizing the on shell tree level @xmath20 and @xmath21 amplitudes in the loop functions .",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23 is the loop function of the two pion propagators , which appears in the bethe salpeter equation , and @xmath24 is the @xmath7 scattering matrix in isospin i=0 , taken from @xcite .",
    "the multiple scattering of the two final pions can be accounted for by means of the bethe salpeter equation ,    @xmath25    where v is given by the lowest order chiral amplitude for @xmath26 in @xmath18 and @xmath23 , the loop function of the two pion propagators can be regularized by means of a cut off or with dimensional regularization . in both approaches",
    "it has been shown that @xmath27 factorizes with its on shell value in the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "hence , in the bethe - salpeter equation the integral involving @xmath28 and the product of the two pion propagators affects only these latter two , since @xmath27 and @xmath29 factorize outside the integral , thus leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bethe ] ) where @xmath30 is the algebraic product of v , the loop function of the two propagators , @xmath23 , and the @xmath29 matrix .",
    "when we renormalize the i=0 amplitude in nuclei to account for the pion final state interaction , we change @xmath31 and @xmath24 by their corresponding results in nuclear matter @xcite evaluated at the local density . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath7 rescattering in nuclear matter was done renormalizing the pion propagators in the medium and introducing vertex corrections for consistency .    in the model for @xmath32 of @xcite",
    "there are indeed contact terms as implied before , as well as other terms involving intermediate nucleon states or resonances . in this latter case",
    "the loop function involves three propagators but the intermediate baryon is far off shell an the factorization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gt1 ] ) still holds .",
    "there is , however , an exception in the @xmath33 kroll ruderman term , since as we increase the photon energy we get closer to the @xmath33 pole .",
    "for this reason this term has been dealt separately making the explicit calculation of the loop with one @xmath33 and two pion propagators .",
    "the cross section for the process in nuclei is calculated using many body techniques . from the imaginary part of the photon selfenergy diagram with a particle - hole excitation and two pion lines as intermediate states ,",
    "the cross section can be expressed as    @xmath34 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cdot\\delta(k^{0}+e(\\vec{p})-\\omega(\\vec{q_1})-\\omega(\\vec{q_2})-e(\\vec{k } + \\vec{p}-\\vec{q_1}-\\vec{q_2}))\\nonumber   \\label{eq : sigma2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the factors @xmath35 take into account the distortion of the final pions in their way out trhough the nucleus and are given by    @xmath36 \\label{eq : feikonal } \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\vspace{0.4cm}\\hspace{-5.5 cm } \\vec{r_i}=\\vec{r}+l_i \\ \\vec{q_i}/\\mid \\vec{q_i}\\mid\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the pion selfenergy , taken from a model based on an extrapolation for low energy pions of a pion - nucleus optical potential developed for pionic atoms using many body techniques .",
    "the imaginary part of the potential is split into a part that accounts for the probability of quasielastic collisions and another one which accounts for the pion absorption . with this approximation",
    "the pions which undergo absorptions are removed from the flux but we do not remove those which undergo quasielastic collisions since they do not change in average the shape or the strength of the @xmath7 invariant mass distribution .",
    "in the figure we can see the results for the two pion invariant mass distributions in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 reactions on @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the difference between the solid and dashed curves is the use of the in medium @xmath1 scattering and @xmath31 function instead of the free ones , which we take from @xcite .",
    "as one can see in the figure , there is an appreciable shift of strength to the low invariant mass region due to the in medium @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this shift is remarkably similar to the one found in the preliminary measurements of @xcite .",
    "this shift is not seen in the @xmath39 channel because the @xmath43 are not allowed to be in isospin i=0 .",
    "these results show a clear signature of the modified @xmath7 interaction in the medium .",
    "the fact that the photons are not distorted has certainly an advantage over the pion induced reactions and allows one to see inner parts of the nucleus .",
    "although we have been discussing the @xmath1 interaction in the nuclear medium it is clear that we can relate it to the modification of the @xmath2 in the medium .",
    "we have mentioned that the reason for the shift of strength to lower invariant masses in the mass distribution is due to the accumulated strength in the scalar isocalar @xmath1 amplitude in the medium . yet",
    ", this strength is mostly governed by the presence of the @xmath2 pole and there have been works suggesting that the sigma should move to smaller masses and widths when embedded in the nucleus .",
    "the present results represent an evidence of the move of pole position of the @xmath2 moves to smaller energies as the nuclear density increases , a phenomenon which would come to strengthen once more the nature of the @xmath2 meson as dynamically generated by the multiple scattering of the pions through the underlying chiral dynamics .",
