    "as we know our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion that can be approximated by an exponentially expanding de - sitter space - time .",
    "it is widely believed , also , that the de - sitter space - time allows a better description of the early stage of inflation .",
    "therefore de - sitter metric is of interest both for the cosmology of the early and late universe .",
    "this importance comes also from the fact that the de - sitter space is the unique maximally symmetric curved space and enjoys the same degrees of symmetry as minkowski space - time .",
    "this explains the increased interest to study physical quantum effects in such a space - time . among these effects",
    "we cite the particle - antiparticle pair creation caused by the expansion of the universe @xcite . the phenomenon of particle creation in de - sitter space has been widely discussed and analyzed from various point of view @xcite .",
    "this is because the fact that the particle creation has many important applications in contemporary cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is known that the creation of particles induces an effective negative pressure which leads to an inflationary phase with an exponential expansion .",
    "after a sufficient time of inflation the exponential expansion will be adiabatically switched off giving rise to a power law expansion .",
    "in addition , the creation of cold dark matter by gravitational fields could explain the actual accelerated expansion without appealing to the existence of dark energy .",
    "the particle creation mechanism could also have significant contribution to the transition from an anisotropic universe to an isotropic one @xcite .    in de - sitter space , the pair production rate , with a pure gravitational field ,",
    "is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the particle mass and @xmath3 is the hubble s constant .",
    "this makes the production of massive ( heavy ) particles negligible . the creation of massive particles is then excluded to play any role in the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the electric field on the creation of fermions from vacuum in the de - sitter space - time .",
    "we know that actually there is no electric field in the universe .",
    "however , as is mentioned in @xcite , we reconcile that electric fields were present during the initial stages of the formation of the universe and they vanish because of the inverse effect of the particle creation .",
    "this idea resembles to the assumption of the anisotropy of the early universe although the present universe is isotropic .",
    "we note that the influence of electric field on the particle creation in expanding universe has been studied in several models describing different stages of the cosmic evolution @xcite .    the schwinger effect in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional de - sitter space - time is extensively studied during the last few years @xcite .",
    "the geometric origin of the schwinger effect in de - sitter space is studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the schwinger mechanism by a uniform electric field in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they expressed the one - loop effective action in the proper - time integral .",
    "then they computed the imaginary part of the effective action and the pair production rate .",
    "the authors of @xcite , considered the problem of particle production by a constant electric field in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional de sitter space as a model for describing false vacuum decay beyond the semiclassical approximation .",
    "they found that the adiabatic in  vacuum associated with the flat chart develops a space - like expectation value for the current , which manifestly breaks the de sitter invariance of the background fields .",
    "however the case studied in particular detail is that of scalar particles .",
    "less studied is the case of fermions , where the spin of the fermion could play an important role on the behavior of created particles .",
    "an interesting attempt to study the creation of fermions by an electric field in de - sitter space is communicated several years ago in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in order to study the effect of particle - antiparticle pair creation form vacuum by gravitational and electric fields we have at our disposal several methods such as the adiabatic method @xcite , the hamiltonian diagonalization technique @xcite , the feynman path integral derivation @xcite , the green function approach @xcite , the semiclassical wkb approximation @xcite as well as the method based on bogoliubov transformation @xcite that we shall use in this paper .",
    "the later method is more convenient for the spin @xmath6 case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; at the beginning we consider a spin @xmath6  fermion subjected to an electric field in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional de - sitter space - time",
    ". then we solve the corresponding dirac equation by introducing an unitary transformation . to investigate the process of particle creation",
    "we apply the canonical method based on bogoliubov transformation connecting the `` _ _ in _ _ '' with the `` _ _ out _ _ '' states .",
    "this method permits us to determine the probability to create pair of particles in a given state , the density number of created particles and the vacuum persistence . to clarify the effect of the electric field on the creation of particles",
    "we compute the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length by doing sum over all states and we show how the electric field influences on the particle creation .",
    "we complete the analysis by deriving the imaginary part of the schwinger effective lagrangian starting from the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude .",
    "these results allows us also to discuss the effect of the actual expansion of the universe on the schwinger effect .",
    "if the universe expansion leads to some enhancement to the schwinger effect , this would be of great interest to experimental physics .",
    "we shall discuss this issue .",
    "let us consider a spin @xmath6  fermion of mass @xmath2 and charge @xmath7 moving on the background geometry of a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional expanding universe described by the line element@xmath8 where @xmath9 , in the presence of an electric field described by the vector potential @xmath10 , with @xmath11 here @xmath12 is an arbitrary function .",

    "the derivation of the effect requires also exact solutions to the field equation . if these solutions are classified as `` in '' and `` out '' states then the bogoliubov transformation between these states leads to exact expressions for the number density of created particles and the probability to create a pair of particles in a given state . in the next section we consider the creation of particle - antiparticle pairs in a de - sitter space with a constant electric field",

    "physically , this fact is not strange because @xmath51 is the canonical momentum and not the physical one .",
    "we remark also that equations ( [ 56 ] ) and ( [ 57 ] ) are in complete agreements with the well - known results corresponding to the pair creation by an electric field in minkowski space - time ( see @xcite and references therein ) .      in minkowski space time , the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length is given by@xmath198 because of the exponential @xmath199 , the field strength required to see the schwinger effect is of order of the critical value @xmath200 .",
    "however , the maximal electric field produced by the current technologies is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the critical value .",
    "this makes@xmath128 very small for a pure electric field .",
    "then , in order to see the effect the @xmath128 must be enhanced exponentially by compensating @xmath199 .",

    "the basic principle of these experiences is the dynamic assistance of the schwinger mechanism by the combination of slower pulse strong laser with a faster pulse weak one .",
    "it this case , the faster pulse gives a multi - photon contribution which leads to an exponential enhancement .",
    "since @xmath208 , even if the schwinger effect is observed in laboratory , it would be difficult to deduce from this observation whether we live in an expanding universe or in a minkowski space - time .      in weak expansion limit the  probability of particle creation per unit of time per unit of length",

    "in conclusion , we have studied in this paper the influence of an electric field on the creation of spin-@xmath6 particle pairs in the ( 1 + 1 ) inflationary de - sitter space - time .",
    "we have shown at the first stage that the schwinger effect in an expanding universe is effectively equivalent to the schwinger effect in minkowski space - time by introducing an unitary transformation to the dirac equation .",
    "this transformation allows us to obtain exact solutions for the case of de - sitter space with a constant electric field .",

    "then the probability to create a pair of particles in a given state and the density of created fermions are calculated .",
    "the obtained expressions show that a constant electric field increases the creation of fermions with positive wave number @xmath51 and minimizes it in the opposite direction .",
    "this effect , which depends on the particle charge and the orientation of the electric field , is of interest because in the absence of the electric field there is no preferred direction for the created particles .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the creation of massless particles with conformal coupling is impossible even if an electric field is present .    by doing summation over all allowed states",
    "we have expressed the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length and the imaginary part of the schwinger effective lagrangian in closed forms .",
    "we have shown that the electric field leads to a significant enhancement of the particle creation .",
    "then , if the particle creation effects on the cosmic evolution are negligible in a pure gravitational field , the presence of a strong electric field makes these effects appreciable .",
    "therefore , the electromagnetic fields influence on the cosmic evolution directly via friedmann equations and by their effect on the creation of particles .",
    "we have also considered the case of weak expansion and we have discussed the effect of the actual expansion of the universe on the schwinger effect .",
    "it is shown that the universe expansion could not assist the schwinger effect to be observed in laboratory and even if the effect is enhanced by the combination of stronger slower pulse with a faster weaker pulse , it would be difficult to see through this effect if the universe is expanding .    even if the problem is modeled in a two dimensional space - time it shows clearly the effect of the electric field on the creation of fermions . taking into account that the number of created particles per unit of time and length in a pure gravitational field ,",
