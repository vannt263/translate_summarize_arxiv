    "a high - energy lepton collider ( lc ) @xcite offers the possibility of direct production of lepton number ( @xmath6 ) carrying heavy states ( such as sleptons @xmath7 in supersymmetry ) and of doing precision physics profiting from low qcd activity .",
    "the possibility of polarising the colliding beams with great accuracy makes the physics potential of a lepton collider even more ambitious . indeed , by polarising the initial beams , one is able to ( approximately ) project the chirality of the couplings intervening in the primary production process , thus probing the chirality structure of an underlying new physics model .",
    "polarisation can also be used to suppress the background from standard model ( sm ) processes ( e.g.  from weak charged currents ) to charged lepton flavour violation ( clfv ) signals .",
    "moreover , threshold scans of chirality projected primary produced particles can be used to determine their masses @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) remains one of the most attractive extensions of the sm .",
    "thus , a very appealing mechanism to explain the smallness of neutrino masses and generate neutrino mixing is to consider a supersymmetric seesaw . a type - i seesaw mechanism",
    "in which the right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos have masses close to the grand unification ( gut ) scale , generates neutrino masses and mixings with naturally large yukawa couplings , and can offer an explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "however , the drawback of such a set - up is that it is very hard to probe since the very heavy rh neutrinos can not be produced at colliders . on the other hand , in a supersymmetric type - i seesaw ( usually dubbed susy seesaw )",
    "the radiative corrections generate flavour violation in the slepton sector @xcite , giving additional sources of lfv at low energy . at a high - energy lc",
    ", sleptons can be copiously produced and their decays lead to potentially observable clfv final states , thus providing a unique probe of this mass generation mechanism .    susy - seesaw induced clfv at a lc has been studied in @xcite focusing on @xmath8-@xmath2 flavour violation , while in @xcite slepton driven clfv was also considered but without relying on a particular origin of slepton mixing .",
    "motivated by the excellent muon reconstruction capabilities and the recently improved upper - limit on @xmath9 @xcite , we studied the susy seesaw induced @xmath2-@xmath1 clfv and its discovery potential at a lc working with polarisable beams @xcite .",
    "the susy seesaw model comprises the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) extended by three chiral superfields @xmath10 , so - called rh neutrino superfields , that are singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "the leptonic part of the superpotential is given by @xmath11 hereafter we work in a flavour basis where the charged lepton yukawa couplings @xmath12 and the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath13 are diagonal .",
    "the slepton soft breaking terms are @xmath14 our analysis is conducted in a framework where susy breaking is flavour blind ( as in minimal supergravity mediated susy breaking ) and the soft breaking parameters satisfy certain universality conditions at a high - energy scale , which we take to be the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath15 gev : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the universal scalar soft - breaking mass and trilinear couplings of the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , and @xmath19 denote lepton flavour indices ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "after electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , the neutrino mass matrix is approximately given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 gev ) .",
    "a convenient means of parametrizing the neutrino yukawa couplings , while at the same time allowing to accommodate the experimental data , is given by the casas - ibarra parametrization @xcite , which reads at the seesaw scale @xmath13 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the light neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath29 is a @xmath30 complex orthogonal matrix that encodes the possible mixings involving rh neutrinos .",
    "we use the standard parametrization for the @xmath28 , with the three mixing angles in the intervals favoured by current data @xcite .      due to the non - trivial flavour structure of @xmath31 , the running from @xmath32 down to the seesaw scale",
    "will induce flavour mixing @xcite in the otherwise approximately flavour conserving slepton soft breaking terms .",
    "this running is more pronounced in the soft breaking terms involving slepton doublets since these have local interactions with the rh ( s)neutrinos . at leading order ,",
    "the flavour mixing induced by these radiative corrections has the form @xmath33 the amount of flavour violation in the slepton sector is encoded in @xmath34 which , as made explicit by equation , is related to high- and low - energy neutrino parameters .",
    "at collider energies , i.e.  at energies of the order of the tev , the ( high - scale ) susy seesaw with the aforementioned assumptions for susy breaking can be interpreted as a minimal deviation from the cmssm that allows for flavour mixing in the slepton soft breaking parameters , since processes mediated by rh ( s)neutrinos are greatly suppressed due to the very high seesaw scale .",
    "we stress that , contrary to other analysis , the origin of this flavour mixing is rooted on , albeit not singly determined by , neutrino oscillations .    in the susy seesaw model , as in the mssm , the sparticle production in @xmath35 collisions are dominated by the following 2-body processes @xmath36 for @xmath5 collisions , the available channels are considerably restricted , and we have @xmath37    since susy - seesaw induced clfv final states are dominated by slepton decays via slepton - lepton-(ew gaugino ) interactions , it is useful to distinguish two cases with respect to the slepton / ew gaugino mass hierarchy . a dark - matter motivated scenario in which sleptons are heavier than the ew gauginos occurs in the so - called `` higgs funnel '' region , while the opposite hierarchy happens in the so - called co - annihilation region .",
    "we thus define two types of points to guide the subsequent analysis    * f points : @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; * c points : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in table [ tb.points ] we give two c- and one f - type points that will be used in the numerical analysis .",

    "hence , we focus our attention on clfv in processes with di - lepton final states plus missing transverse momenta , @xmath47 .",
    "the main source of background arises from weak charged currents producing neutrinos which , analogously to the lsp , escape undetected .",
    "these are of two types : the sm charged current backgrounds ( type b ) in which all @xmath47 is due to neutrinos ; susy charged current backgrounds ( type c ) in which @xmath47 contains both neutrinos and lsps . here , we study the following possibilities : @xmath48 where ( a ) is the signal . in table",

    "@xcite we conduct a phenomenological analysis , focusing on theoretical estimations of the expected number of events at a lc operating at a given centre of mass energy with the possibility of polarised beams .",
    "more precisely , our analysis is based on an algorithmic calculation of the possible production and decay modes , considering that the majority of the events proceeds from an on - shell primary production ( so that there are no interference effects between the different contributions ) , with subsequent two - body cascade decays ( the exception being 3-body decays of the @xmath8 ) .    for sparticle primary production ,",

    "we have taken a degenerate right - handed neutrino spectrum and set @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    as can be seen , the sm background , consisting mainly of @xmath49-strahlung and @xmath49-pair production , dominates the signal by approximately one order of magnitude for c@xmath42 and three orders of magnitude for f. moreover , the susy background dominates ( is comparable to ) the signal in f ( c@xmath42 ) . to understand these two observations , notice that the principal decay modes of sleptons and ew gauginos in f - type points are given by @xmath70 while for c - type points we have @xmath71 thus , solely from the width of the decays we expect @xmath72 , which , for the same amount of flavour violation , gives that the expected signal cross sections for f points should be lower than for c points .",
    "in fact , we find that typically @xmath73 .",
    "additionally , we observe that in c - type points , by taking a centre of mass energy above the @xmath74 production threshold and below the production threshold of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is possible to evade the largest contribution from susy charged current backgrounds . for c@xmath42",
    "this happens above @xmath77 gev and below @xmath78 gev , as can be inferred from figure [ fig.c1fsqrts ] .",
    "since @xmath49-pair production and @xmath49-strahlung backgrounds dominate the signal in @xmath35 collisions , it is interesting to consider how beam polarisation can be exploited to suppress their contribution without compromising the signal .",
    "we will do this by considering limiting cases , that is , @xmath79% polarisations .",
    "since slepton flavour mixing occurs predominantly in the ll slepton sector , i.e.  via decays of mostly left - handed slepton mass eigenstates , to avoid suppressing the @xmath80 signal we require the @xmath81 beam to be @xmath82 left - polarised , while no constraint is placed on the positron beam .",
    "constraints on the positron beam arise by requiring the suppression of both @xmath49-pair production and @xmath49-strahlung production cross sections . in @xmath49-pair production ,",
    "the s - channel is strongly dominated by vector boson interactions which can be suppressed by taking equally polarised beams .",
    "the t - channel is suppressed either by @xmath83 or @xmath84 beams .",
    "therefore , we can suppress both channels by left - polarising the positron beam . regarding @xmath49-strahlung",
    ", a maximal suppression would require @xmath85 which would strongly suppress the signal .",
    "nevertheless , the choice @xmath86 is preferable to @xmath87 one .    in figure [ fig.c1ll ]",
    "we show the result of left - polarising both positron and electron beams for point c@xmath42 , with parameters and line colour code as in figure [ fig.c1fsqrts ] .",
    "clearly , the signal is enhanced by a factor of @xmath88 near the ( @xmath89 ) production threshold , while at higher energies the enhancement becomes smaller .",
    "the low energy tail of the susy background `` disappears '' , as is understandable from the fact that such processes proceed via @xmath90 primary production .",
    "moreover , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 primary production are greatly suppressed .",
    "as expected , the sm background is also suppressed , becoming comparable to the signal .",
    "cross section for @xmath68 ( with @xmath91 ) , for point c@xmath42 , as a function of the centre of mass energy @xmath65 , for @xmath79% ll polarised beams .",

    "line and colour code as in figure [ fig.c1fsqrts].,width=283 ]      we now discuss how the observation of a signal would allow to probe the underlying mechanism of slepton flavour mixing . if compatible with seesaw predictions , an observation would indeed strengthen the seesaw hypothesis , since a single mechanism would be able to explain many observables : the smallness of neutrino masses while generating neutrino mixings ; and collider clfv .",
    "moreover , low energy observables such as cr(@xmath2-@xmath1 , n ) and br(@xmath92 ) would serve to further strengthen the hypothesis , provided that the predictions would be compatible with observations / exclusion limits .",
    "in figure [ fig.nevents ] we display the expected number of @xmath93 events from @xmath94% ll polarised electron beams , as a function of the seesaw scale , @xmath95 , for point c@xmath43 .",

    "if the observed number of events is not accommodated by predictions , then it is likely that either the susy seesaw is not the unique source of lfv or that another mechanism for neutrino mass generation is at work .",
    "if the observed number of events can be accommodated by predictions , as illustrated in figure [ fig.nevents ] for point c@xmath43 , then one can constrain ( or even hint at ) the seesaw scale . for example , if susy is realised with a c@xmath43-like spectrum and more than @xmath101 signal events are observed for a total integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath102 ab@xmath103 , then the seesaw scale , @xmath95 , should be above @xmath104 gev .",
    "moreover , evading the exclusion limits on @xmath9 sets an upper bound on this scale , so that we would be led to @xmath104 gev @xmath105 @xmath95 @xmath105 @xmath106 gev .",
    "if we now suppose that @xmath9 is observed at meg , e.g.  with a branching ratio of the order of @xmath107 , we would expect a number of @xmath108 signal events below @xmath109",
    ". this incompatibility could be due to ( unaccounted for ) destructive interferences in collider processes , or additional sources of lfv that only contribute to low - energy observables .",
    "same sign di - muon final states may possibly be a `` golden channel '' for the detection of clfv at an lc . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the efficiency of the muon detectors can be fully explored when looking for di - muon final states .",
    "on the theoretical side , higher signal significances are expected , in particular due to very suppressed sm backgrounds .    in figure [ fig.mumu ]",
