    "quantum antiferromagnetic models are expected to possess a similarly rich structure , but classifying these structures is a challenge , including even the rigorous identification of a spectral gap in natural generalisations of the aklt state to 2d lattices .",
    "methods from the theory of quantum computation provide a new approach to identifying and classifying the quantum order present in antiferromagnetic spin lattice models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown for 1d antiferromagnetic spin chains that their unique type of quantum order can be identified with an infinite localizable entanglement length  @xcite .",

    "the minimum energy of each @xmath5 term may be set to zero by adding a multiple of the identity , and by replacing each @xmath5 with the projector onto its image we will not change the ground space of the hamiltonian nor any crucial spectral properties such as the existence of a spectral gap . therefore , for simplicity , in this paper we need only consider frustration - free hamiltonians that are sums of projectors .      the standard aklt parent hamiltonian may be defined on an arbitrary graph @xmath8 as follows . at each vertex @xmath9 of the graph place a spin-@xmath10 particle , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the degree of vertex @xmath13 .",
    "the aklt hamiltonian is an antiferromagnetic interaction hamiltonian given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin of particle @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the projection onto the spin-@xmath18 irreducible representation of particles @xmath16 and @xmath19 . defined in this way , @xmath20 has a unique zero - energy eigenstate , which we call the aklt state @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the aklt state is a zero eigenstate of each term in , implying that the hamiltonian is frustration - free .",
    "we note that the terms in this hamiltonian do not commute with each other , and so establishing the existence of a spectral gap for such models is highly non - trivial . for two - dimensional lattices",
    ", it remains an open question in general whether this aklt hamiltonian possesses a spectral gap in the thermodynamic limit .      a graph state , and its corresponding parent hamiltonian , may also be defined on an arbitrary graph @xmath8 .",

    "this result necessarily comes about because we have restricted to two - body hamiltonians for which certain ground states ( e.g. , graph states ) can not be reached without closing the gap .",

    "eq . will hold for any set of particles @xmath67 , however here we will set @xmath67 to be an arbitrary two - particle region @xmath100 .",

    "this eliminates all but four possible stabilizer elements from membership in @xmath107 : @xmath36 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "as we have assumed that the degree of @xmath23 is at least 2 , @xmath36 and @xmath108 must act non - trivially outside @xmath67 , and thus @xmath36 and @xmath108 are not contained in @xmath107 .",
