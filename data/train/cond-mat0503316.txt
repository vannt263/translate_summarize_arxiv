    "since the ground - breaking papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks @xcite , the research interest on complex networks as an interdisciplinary subject has soared @xcite .",
    "complex networks describe many systems in nature and society , most of which share three apparent features : power - law degree distribution , small average path length ( apl ) and high clustering coefficient .",
    "while many models @xcite have been proposed to describe real - life networks , most of them are stochastic .",
    "however , new deterministic models with fixed degree distributions constructed by recursive methods have been recently introduced @xcite .",
    "deterministic models have the strong advantage that it is often possible to compute analytically their properties , which may be compared with experimental data from real and simulated networks .",
    "deterministic networks can be created by various techniques : modification of some regular graphs  @xcite , addition and product of graphs  @xcite , and other mathematical methods as in  @xcite .",
    "concerning the problem of apollonian packing , two groups independently introduced the apollonian networks @xcite which have interesting properties like being scale - free , euclidean , matching , space - filling and can be applied to porous media , polydisperse packings , road networks or electrical supply systems @xcite and may also help to explain the properties of energy landscapes and the associated scale - free network of connected minima @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple iterative algorithm to generate high - dimensional apollonian networks based on a similar idea as that of the recursive graphs proposed in @xcite .",
    "the introduced algorithm can concretize the problems of abstract high - dimensional apollonian packings . using the algorithm",
    "we determine relevant characteristics of high - dimensional apollonian networks : the degree distribution , clustering coefficient and diameter , all of which depend on the dimension of apollonian packings .",
    "it should be pointed out that the concept of high - dimensional apollonian networks was already introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in these works , however , the emphasis is placed on two - dimensional apollonian networks and their aim is to address the behavior of dynamical processes @xcite or provide a model to help understand the energy landscape networks @xcite . here , we focus on the producing algorithm , based on which we provide a detailed calculation of the topology characterization of high - dimensional apollonian networks and we show that it depends on the dimension .",

    "( b ) construction of two - dimensional apollonian networks , showing the first iterations steps .",
    "vertices introduced in the initial , first , second and third iterations have symbols @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "from the problem of apollonian packing , a two - dimensional example of which is shown in fig.1(a ) , andrade et al . introduced apollonian networks @xcite which were independently proposed by doye and massen in @xcite . apollonian packing dates back to apollonius of perga who lived around 200 bc .",
    "the classic two - dimensional apollonian packing is constructed by starting with three mutually touching circles , whose interstice is a curvilinear triangle to be filled . then a circle is inscribed , touching all the sides of this curvilinear triangle .",
    "we call this the first iteration @xmath4 and the initial configuration is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "for subsequent iterations we indefinitely repeat the process for all the newly generated curvilinear triangles . in the limit of infinite iterations ,",
    "the well - known two - dimensional apollonian packing is obtained .    from the two - dimensional apollonian packing",
    ", one can straightforwardly define a two - dimensional apollonian network @xcite , where the vertices are associated to the circles and two vertices are connected if the corresponding circles are tangent .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows how the network is translated from the two - dimensional apollonian packing construction .",
    "the two - dimensional apollonian network can be generalized to high - dimensions ( @xmath6-dimensional , @xmath7 ) @xcite associated with other self - similar packings @xcite ) .",
    "next a comprehensive account will be given .",
    "first , we address @xmath6-dimensional apollonian packings which are constructed iteratively in a similar way as shown in fig .",
    "initially , we have @xmath8 mutually touching @xmath6-dimensional hyperspheres with a curvilinear @xmath6-dimensional simplex ( @xmath6-simplex ) as their interstice . in the first iteration",
    "one @xmath6-hypersphere is added to fill the interstice in the initial configuration , such that the added @xmath6-hypersphere touches each of the @xmath8 @xmath6-hyperspheres .",
    "the process is continued for all the newly created curvilinear @xmath6-dimensional simplex in the successive iterations . in the limit of infinite iterations ,",
    "the resulting pictures are @xmath6-dimensional apollonian packings . if each @xmath6-hypersphere corresponds to a vertex and vertices",
    "are connected by an edge if the corresponding @xmath6-hyperspheres are in contact , then one gets @xmath6-dimensional apollonian networks .",
    "in the iterative process for the construction of high - dimensional apollonian networks at each iteration , for each new hypersphere added , @xmath8 new interstices are created in the associated apollonian packing which will be filled in the next iteration .",
    "when building networks , we can say in equivalent words that for each new vertex added , @xmath8 new @xmath6-simplices are generated in the network , into which vertices will be inserted in the next iteration . according to this process , we can introduce a general iterative algorithm to create high - dimensional apollonian networks which is similar to the process that allow the construction of the recursive graphs introduced in @xcite . before introducing the algorithm",
    "we give the following definitions .",
    "a * complete graph * @xmath9 ( also referred in the literature as * @xmath6-clique * ; see @xcite ) is a graph with @xmath6 vertices , where there is no loop or multiple edge and every vertex is joined to every other by an edge .",
    "generally speaking , two graphs are said to be * isomorphic * if the vertices and edges of one graph match up with vertices and edges of other , and the edge matching be consistent with the vertex matching .",
    "we denote the @xmath6-dimensional apollonian network after @xmath10 iterations by @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "then the @xmath6-dimensional apollonian network at step @xmath10 is constructed as follows : for @xmath5 , @xmath13 is the complete graph @xmath14 ( or @xmath15-clique ) , and @xmath13 has @xmath8 vertices and @xmath16 edges . for @xmath17 , @xmath11 is obtained from @xmath18 by adding for each of its existing subgraphs isomorphic to a @xmath15-clique and created at step @xmath19 a new vertex and joining it to all the vertices of this subgraph ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) for the case @xmath20 ) .",
    "then , at @xmath4 , we add one new vertex and @xmath8 new edges to the graph , creating @xmath8 new @xmath14 cliques and resulting in the complete graph with @xmath21 vertices , denoted @xmath22 . at @xmath23",
    "we add @xmath8 new vertices , each of them connected to all the vertices of one of the @xmath8 cliques @xmath14 created at @xmath4 introducing @xmath24 new edges , and so on .",
    "note that the addition of each new vertex leads to @xmath8 new @xmath15-cliques and @xmath8 new edges .",
    "so the number of vertices and edges newly born at step @xmath25 become @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . therefore ,",
    "similarly to many real - life networks such as the world wide web , the @xmath6-dimensional apollonian network is a growing network , whose number of vertices increases exponentially with time .    thus we can easily see that at step @xmath10 , the apollonian network @xmath11 has    @xmath28    vertices and    @xmath29    edges    the average degree @xmath30 is then @xmath31    for large @xmath10 it is approximately @xmath32 .",
    "we can see when @xmath10 is large enough the resulting networks are sparse graphs as many real - world networks whose vertices have many fewer connections than is possible .",
    "below we will find that the dimension @xmath6 is a tunable parameter controlling all the relevant characteristics of the @xmath6-dimensional apollonian network .",
    "when a new vertex @xmath33 is added to the graph at step @xmath25 , it has degree @xmath8 and forms @xmath8 new @xmath15-cliques . from the iterative algorithm",
    ", we can see that each new neighbor of @xmath33 generated @xmath6 new @xmath15-cliques with @xmath33 as one vertex of them . in the next iteration",
    ", these @xmath15-cliques will introduce new vertices that are connected to the vertex @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the degree of @xmath33 at step @xmath10 and @xmath35 be the increment of @xmath34 minus @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath35 of vertex @xmath33 evolves as    @xmath37    combining the initial condition @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 and the degree of vertex @xmath33 becomes @xmath41 the distribution of all vertices and their degrees at step @xmath10 is given in table  [ tab : table2 ] , from which we can see that the degree spectrum of the graph is discrete and some values of the degree are absent .",
    "to relate the exponent of this discrete degree distribution to the standard @xmath42 exponent as defined for continuous degree distribution , we use a cumulative distribution @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are points of the discrete degree spectrum . the analytic computation details are given as follows .",
    ".[tab : table2 ] distribution of vertices and their degrees for @xmath11 at step @xmath10 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a degree @xmath44 @xmath46 there are @xmath47 vertices with this exact degree , all of which were introduced at step @xmath48 .",
    "all vertices introduced at time @xmath48 or earlier have this and a higher degree .",
    "so we have @xmath49 as the total number of vertices at step @xmath10 is given in eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) we have @xmath50^{1-\\gamma } = \\frac{\\frac{(d+1)^{l}-1}{d}+d+1}{\\frac{(d+1)^t-1}{d}+d+1}\\nonumber\\\\ = \\frac{(d+1)^{l}+d(d+1)-1}{(d+1)^t+d(d+1)-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , for large @xmath10 we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 so that @xmath53 .",
    "we note that this result was already obtained by doye and massen in @xcite .",
    "also , notice that when @xmath10 gets large , the maximal degree of a vertex roughly equals to @xmath54 .",
    "the clustering coefficient  @xcite of a single vertex is the ratio of the total number of edges that actually exist between all @xmath44 its nearest neighbors and the potential number of edges @xmath55 between them .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of all individual vertices .",
    "we can derive analytical expressions for the clustering @xmath56 for any vertex with degree @xmath44 .",
    "when a vertex is created it is connected to all the vertices of a @xmath15-clique whose vertices are completely interconnected .",
    "it follows that a vertex with degree @xmath57 has a clustering coefficient of one because all the @xmath58 possible links between its neighbors actually exist . in the following steps , if a newly created vertex is connected to the considered vertex whose @xmath6 nearest neighbors",
    "must also be linked by the new one at the same step .",
    "thus for a vertex @xmath59 of degree @xmath44 , the exact expression for its clustering coefficient is    @xmath60    depending on degree @xmath44 and dimension @xmath6 . using this result",
    ", we can compute now the clustering of the graph at step @xmath10 , it is @xmath61 , where    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) are the degrees of the vertices created at steps @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "one can easily prove that for @xmath67 and for any @xmath7 the following relation hold true .",
    "@xmath68    therefore the clustering coefficient of high dimension apollonian networks is very large .",
    "similarly to the power exponent @xmath42 of the degree distribution , the clustering is also tunable simply by changing the value of control parameter @xmath6 . from eq . (",
    "11 ) , one can see that the clustering coefficient increases with @xmath6 and approaches a limit of @xmath69 when @xmath6 gets large . in the special cases @xmath20 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 equals to constant asymptotic values 0.8284  @xcite and 0.8852 , respectively .",
    "the diameter of a network characterizes the maximum communication delay in the network and is defined as the longest shortest path between all pairs of vertices . in what follows , the notations @xmath72 and @xmath73 express the integers obtained by rounding @xmath74 to the nearest integers towards infinity and minus infinity , respectively .",
    "now we compute the diameter of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath75 for @xmath7 :    _ step 1_. the diameter is @xmath69 .",
    "_ steps 2 to @xmath76_. in this case , the diameter is 2 , since any new vertex is by construction connected to a @xmath15-clique , and since any @xmath77-clique during those steps contains at least the vertex created at step 1 , which is from the initial clique @xmath22 or @xmath78 obtained after step 1 , thus the diameter is 2 .",
    "_ steps @xmath79 to @xmath21_. in any of those steps , some newly added vertices might not share a neighbor in the original clique @xmath22 obtained after step 1 ; however , any newly added vertex is connected to at least one vertex of the initial clique @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the diameter is equal to 3 .    _",
    "further steps_. clearly , at each step @xmath80 , the diameter always lies between a pair of vertices that have just been created at this step .",
    "we will call the newly created vertices `` outer '' vertices . at any step @xmath80",
    ", we note that an outer vertex can not be connected with two or more vertices that were created during the same step @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , by construction no two vertices that were created during a given step are neighbors , thus they can not be part of the same @xmath77-clique .",
    "thus , for any step @xmath80 , some outer vertices are connected with vertices that appeared at pairwise different steps .",
    "thus , there exists an outer vertex @xmath82 created at step @xmath10 , which is connected to vertices @xmath83s , @xmath84 , where all the @xmath33s are pairwise distinct .",
    "we conclude that @xmath82 is necessarily connected to a vertex that was created at a step @xmath85 .",
    "if we repeat this argument , then we obtain an upper bound on the distance from @xmath82 to the initial clique @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "then , we see that @xmath82 is at distance at most @xmath88 from a vertex in @xmath22 .",
    "hence any two vertices @xmath82 and @xmath89 in @xmath11 lie at distance at most @xmath90 ; however , depending on @xmath91 , this distance can be reduced by 1 , since when @xmath92 , we know that two vertices created at step @xmath91 share at least a neighbor in @xmath22",
    ". thus , when @xmath93 , @xmath94 , while when @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "one can see that these distance bounds can be reached by pairs of outer vertices created at step @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , those two vertices @xmath82 and @xmath89 share the property that they are connected to @xmath6 vertices that appeared respectively at steps @xmath97 .    hence , the diameter increases by 2 every @xmath8 steps . more precisely , we have the following result , for any @xmath7 and @xmath98 ( when @xmath4 , the diameter is clearly equal to 1 ) : @xmath99 where @xmath100 if @xmath101 , and 1 otherwise .    in the limit of large @xmath10 , @xmath102 , while @xmath103 , thus the diameter is small and scales logarithmically with the network size .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a general iterative algorithm to produce high dimensional apollonian networks associated with high dimensional packings .",
    "the networks present the typical characteristics of real - life networks in nature and society as they are small - world and have a power - law degree distribution .",
    "we compute analytical expressions for the degree distribution , the clustering coefficient , and the diameter of the networks , all of which are determined by the dimension of the associated apollonian packings .",
    "the high dimensional apollonian networks introduced here , and the consideration of the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , allow the construction of high dimensional random apollonian networks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it should be worth studying in detail physical models such as ising models  @xcite and processes such as percolation , spreading , searching and diffusion that take place on the higher - dimensional apollonian networks to know also their relation with the dimension .",
