    "in the early days of pulsar observations , slow fluctuations of pulsar amplitudes were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but it was not recognized that they were an interstellar propagation effect until a close correlation between the time - scale of the intensity fluctuations and the pulsar dispersion measure was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite explained these slow fluctuations as refractive interstellar scintillations ( riss ) .",
    "this phenomenon is produced by the same spectrum of electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium that is responsible for the well known diffractive scintillation ( diss ) .",
    "diss is caused by the small spatial scale density fluctuations ( @xmath2  m ) and it appears as intensity variations in both the time and frequency domains with characteristic scales of minutes to hours and khz to mhz respectively .",
    "on the other hand , large - scale inhomogeneities ( @xmath3  m ) in the interstellar medium give rise to focussing effects observed as riss .",
    "a good review of the theory behind this interpretation is given by @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the spectrum of electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium has a power - law form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wave - vector associated with a spatial size @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is a measure of turbulence along a particular line of sight .",
    "the power - law index @xmath8 which indicates the steepness of the inhomogeneity spectrum is in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "but the details of the spectrum , e.g. its slope and the range of scale sizes over which it is valid , still remain open questions .",
    "also , different assumptions are made about the distribution of scattering material along the path to the pulsar .",
    "many observations are well accounted for by models in which the scattering is concentrated in a single centrally located thin screen , but others imply that there are many scattering sites or a statistically uniform screen extending over most or all of the path .",
    "a range of observations suggest that a kolmogorov fluctuation spectrum with @xmath10 is widely applicable in the interstellar medium @xcite . however , observational studies showing , for example , persistent drifting bands in dynamic spectra and increased modulation of diffractive properties suggest that excess power is often seen at low spatial frequencies , implying a spectral index @xmath11",
    ". examples of extensive studies are those by @xcite , who studied eight pulsars at 408 mhz using the lovell telescope and interpreted changing diffractive patterns in dynamic spectra in terms of refractive effects , and those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these latter authors used the ooty radio telescope at 327 mhz to study 18 pulsars over a 2.5-year dataspan and showed that , while many observations were consistent with a kolmogorov spectrum , others showed evidence of a steeper spectrum .",
    "@xcite reported on 5 years of daily monitoring of the flux density of 21 pulsars at 610 mhz , showing that most of the results , covering a wide range of scattering strengths , were consistent with a kolmogorov fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in some pulsars , though modulation indices were higher than expected , possibly due to the presence of an `` inner scale '' , a cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum at scales greater than the diffractive scale @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavelength and @xmath14 is the angular size of the scattering disk .    other observations suggesting steeper power - law spectra ( @xmath15 ) include fringing in dynamic spectra implying multiple imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and extreme scattering events @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a steeper spectrum to deal with the theoretical difficulties in supporting a turbulent cascade in the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "based on power - law models of the spectrum , @xcite analysed the effects of riss on diffractive parameters for different slopes @xmath10 , 4 and 4.3 , predicting anti - correlations for ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) and ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 ) , where @xmath16 is flux density and @xmath17 , @xmath19 are the diffractive scintillation bandwidth and timescale , respectively and a postive correlation for ( @xmath17,@xmath19 ) , with the magnitudes of the correlation coefficients being larger for steeper spectra .",
    "more recent observations have tended to concentrate on detailed studies of individual pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or on the fascinating `` scintillation arcs '' which are seen in secondary spectra , that is , two - dimensional fourier transforms of dynamic spectra , in high - sensitivity , high - resolution observations @xcite .",
    "these arcs , which are closely related to multiple imaging and the frequently observed `` criss - cross '' sloping bands , result from interference between rays in a central core and rays from an extended scattering disk .",
    "they form a powerful probe of structure in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite present recent observations of six pulsars showing multiple arcs of different curvature implying a distribution of scattering centres along the line of sight .",
    "psr b0329 + 54 is one of the strongest pulsars known and its scintillation properties have been studied by many authors .",
    "observations at 610 mhz by @xcite showed that the correlations between variations of flux , decorrelation bandwidth and scintillation time - scale were consistent with the theoretical predictions with @xmath20 .",
    "however , @xcite found that for psr b0329 + 54 , correlations between these parameters at 327 mhz were not in accord with the predictions .",
    "long - term flux density monitoring at 610 mhz by @xcite showed that the modulation index was somewhat higher than expected for a kolmogorov spectrum , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite took data obtained over a wide range of frequencies finding a value of @xmath22 , less than but consistent with a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum , and interpreted this result in terms of weak plasma turbulence in the interstellar medium .",
    "observations at 1540 mhz using the nanshan telescope @xcite showed inconsistencies in values of the power - law index obtained from two different approaches .",
    "the ratio of refractive scattering angle @xmath23 and diffractive angle @xmath24 gave @xmath25 , while the frequency dependence of scintillation parameters gave @xmath26 .",
    "these conflicting results suggested undertaking observations with a better sampling of the refractive variations .",
    "these have a predicted timescale @xmath27 @xcite , about four days for this pulsar .    in this paper , we present the results of quasi - continuous 1540  mhz observations of psr b0329 + 54 over a 20-day interval in 2004 , march .",
    "diffractive parameters were sampled at 90-min intervals , giving good resolution of the expected riss variations .",
    "the layout for the rest of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the observations ; data analysis and results are shown in section 3 , and in section 4 , we discuss the results and their interpretation .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the observations were made using the nanshan 25  m radio telescope with a central frequency of 1540 mhz .",
    "our system is sensitive to orthogonal linear polarizations and the system temperature for the two channels is 20  k and 22  k respectively .",
    "each polarization has 128 channels , each of bandwidth 2.5  mhz , giving a total bandwidth of 320  mhz . after detection and high - pass filtering ,",
    "the data are 1-bit sampled and folded at the apparent pulsar period .",
    "signals from the two polarizations are summed to form total intensity pulse profiles .",
    "we made our observations from march 12 to march 31 in 2004 , and obtained more than 150 scintillation dynamic spectra for psr  b0329 + 54 .",
    "the observations were continuous ( psr b0329 + 54 is circumpolar at nanshan ) apart from an interruption of about 3 days from march 20 due to telescope problems . in our analysis , the time block for each dynamic spectrum is typically 90 minutes with a sub - integration time of 60  s. we calibrated the pulsar flux density scale using observations of ten strong , relatively distant pulsars which all have well - measured flux densities in the atnf pulsar catalogue ( www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat ) .",
    "dynamic spectra were obtained for each observation by plotting the mean flux density in each channel against time .",
    "examples of these plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : dynamic ] .",
    "channels badly affected by radio - frequency interference have been interpolated over from adjacent frequency channels .    fig .",
    "[ fg : dynamic ] shows that the dynamic spectra are well resolved and that the scintles or peaks of flux density change their shapes and sizes in the frequency and time domains . at some epochs , the pulsar seems weaker and the scintles are smaller ( mjd 53088.4 ) , and at other epochs , the pulsar signal is stronger and the scintles larger ( e.g. mjds 53081.6 , 53083.2 , 53093.3 ) . the frequency dependence of diss can be seen within our receiver bandwidth , i.e. , scintles are smaller at the lower end of the observed band ( mjd 53091.8 ) . at some epochs",
    "the spectra show a significant drifting pattern ( e.g. mjd 53082.4 ) , which implies a modulation by riss .",
    "however , we did nt observe the fine fringes seen in the data of @xcite .",
    "the scintles are generally smaller in this observing session , resulting in a smaller value in @xmath28 , which we will discuss more in section  [ sec : gauss ] .",
    "deep modulations are common in all the dynamic spectra we have recorded .    the limited number of scintles in the dynamic spectra introduces a statistical estimation error in the scintillation parameters @xcite . an approximate estimate of the number of scintles @xmath29 in the dynamic spectra is given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total observing time and @xmath32 the total observing bandwidth , @xmath28 decorrelation bandwidth and @xmath19 is the diss timescale .",
    "the fractional estimation error is then given by : @xmath33 where we assume a scintle filling factor of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "this error contribution is taken into account in the estimates of scintillation parameters in section  [ sec : gauss ] .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier spectrum of the primary dynamic spectrum is often referred to as the secondary spectrum . to show the beautiful arc structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , high frequency resolution and high sensitivity are required .",
    "unfortunately , the nanshan system does not provide these .",
    "however , earlier observations at 1540  mhz for this pulsar by @xcite showed sloping fringes in the dynamic spectra resulting in offset features in the secondary spectra .",
    "surprisingly , despite using the same system at nanshan , our three - week consecutive observations show no significant arc structure or offset features in the secondary spectra .",
    "to quantify the diffractive parameters , we use the two - dimensional auto - correlation function ( acf ) , which was computed for frequency lags up to half of the observing bandwidth and for time lags up to half of the observing time . the acf of the dynamic spectra @xmath34 is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the mean pulsar flux density over each observation , then the normalized acf is : @xmath38    we plot the normalized acf and one dimensional cut at zero time and frequency lag in fig .",
    "[ fg : contour ] .",
    "these figures correspond to the dynamic spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : dynamic ] .",
    "following convention , the diss time - scale @xmath19 is defined as the time lag at zero frequency lag where the acf is 1/e of the maximum , and the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath28 is defined as the half - width at half - maximum of the acf along the frequency lag axis at zero time lag @xcite . for weaker pulsars , random system noise results in a strong spike at the zero time and frequency lag of acf . for psr b0329 + 54",
    "the spike is weak but still observable at some epochs . to remove the spike at the origin we used the four neighbouring frequency - lag points to fit for a parabola across the zero frequency lag .",
    "the central point is interpolated from this fit .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian function to fit the acf with form : @xmath39,\\ ] ] in which @xmath40 is unity since the acf is normalized to unity . by using a @xmath41 minimization procedure , we obtained parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the fitting procedure was a search for the three non - linear parameters for the least - squared error between model and data over the central region of acf .",
    "the scintillation parameters @xmath28 and @xmath19 are calculated as : @xmath45    following @xcite , we use @xmath46 to describe the orientation of the elliptical gaussian .",
    "this is proportional to the refractive scattering angle @xmath47 , and is given by : @xmath48 .    from the @xmath49 analysis",
    ", we also obtained the uncertainties for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . using these uncertainties added in quadrature with the statistical error ( equation  [ eq : staerr ] )",
    ", we calculate the errors of @xmath50 , @xmath19 and @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath46 has zero mean , we applied the statistical error to @xmath51 rather than to @xmath43 itself .",
    "for flux density , measurement errors are estimated from the baseline noise in the mean pulse profiles .",
    "time variations of @xmath16 , @xmath28 , @xmath52 and @xmath46 along with their uncertainties are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : para ] .",
    "these parameters show significant variations with time which can be explained as an riss effect as discussed in section  [ sec : interpretation ] .      given a power - law spectrum of electron density fluctuations ( equation  [ eq : spectrum ] ) , the average scattering level along the line - of - sight , @xmath7 , for a kolmogorov spectrum is given by @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "another quantitative measurement of the strength of scattering is the parameter @xmath54 which is defined as the ratio of the fresnel scale @xmath55 to the coherence scale @xmath56 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the diffractive scattering angle . for strong scattering , @xmath57 . in terms of the diffractive scintillation parameter @xmath28 : @xmath58    the diffractive timescale depends on the velocity of the ray path across the scattering screen .",
    "assuming a thin screen and that the pulsar velocity dominates , an estimate for the pulsar transverse velocity based on the scintillation parameters is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ratio of the observer - screen distance to the pulsar - screen distance and the proportionality constant @xmath61 @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tb : param ] we give some basic parameters for the pulsar and observations as well as mean values for the basic scattering parameters .",
    "the pulsar distance is based on a parallax measurement by @xcite who also measured the pulsar proper motion , @xmath62 mas yr@xmath63 which , with the distance , gives the transverse velocity listed in the table . the typical observation time for each dynamic spectrum and the total number of such observations are given .",

    "we note that the scintillation timescale @xmath19 is much less than the observation time ( 90 min ) , so the effects of finite observation time discussed by @xcite should be minimal .",
    "the predicted refractive timescale , @xmath76 based on the diffractive parameters ( equation  [ eq : tref ] ) , is about 4  d , but the observed value ( section  [ sec : ref - time ] ) is much less than that .",
    "the derived scattering level , @xmath7 , and scattering strength , @xmath54 , both indicate that scattering is strong along the path to psr b0329 + 54 . for the quoted scintillation velocity ,",

    "while these results are not too discordant , it is clear that there are variations on timescales much longer than the nominal refractive time and also that the frequency scaling of the diffractive parameters does not precisely follow the kolmogorov prediction ( cf .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another possible intepretation of the relatively large observed modulation indices is that the scattering medium is extended so that the thin - screen approximation is not valid .",
    "the flux density modulation index for a statistically uniform scattering medium with a kolmogorov spectrum ( @xmath90 ) covering the whole path to the pulsar has been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with the result @xmath91 for our observations of psr b0329 + 54 , this relation gives a predicted @xmath92 , larger than the observed value .",
    "this implies that , as an alternative to a steeper spectrum , the observed modulation index could be accounted for by an extended kolmogorov scattering medium covering just part of the path .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines on the structure function plots ( fig .",
    "[ fg : struct ] ) are at @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the observed modulation index given in in table  [ tb : mod ] .",
    "the refractive timescale @xmath76 is defined to be the lag at which the structure function falls to @xmath95 . in the flux density case , this is at @xmath77 h. the structure functions for the diffractive bandwidth and timescale are less well defined , but clearly also imply a short refractive timescale .",
    "the measured timescale is much less than the predicted value of about 96  h based on a central thin - screen model and the observed diffractive timescale ( table  [ tb : param ] ) .",
    "for an extended scattering medium with a kolmogorov spectrum , evaluating the equations of @xcite with practical units gives @xmath96 substituting the parameters from our observations of psr b0329 + 54 gives a value of about 32 hours , again much larger than the observed value .",
    "@xcite also consider the case of a thin screen at an arbitrary location along the path and show that @xmath76 is proportional to the pulsar - screen distance ( @xmath97 ) whereas @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath99 , refractive times are much reduced , whereas @xmath19 is only weakly dependent on @xmath97 .",
    "this breaks the approximate proportionality of @xmath76 and @xmath19 ( equation  [ eq : tref ] ) which applies to both a central thin screen and an extended medium .",
    "the scintillation arc observations of @xcite suggest that most of the scattering for psr b0329 + 54 occurs relatively close to the pulsar , supporting this interpretation of the short refractive timescale .",
    "the slope of the linear part of the structure function , between the noise and saturation regimes , is related to the power - law index of the fluctuation spectrum . for a single thin screen",
    ", the slope should be 2.0 for @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "for an extended screen , the predicted slope is @xmath101 @xcite . although the observed slopes are not very well determined , they are clearly @xmath102 . the measured value for the flux density structure function slope is @xmath1 and the values for the other two structure functions are similar .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with scattering by a single thin screen .",
    "as we have argued above , there are good arguments supporting the idea that the scattering screen in this direction is extended ; in this case , the implied value of @xmath103 , somewhat less than but marginally consistent with the kolmogorov value . based on the thin - screen model ,",
    "observed diffractive bandwidths and a refractive interpretation of band slopes ( @xmath46 ) , @xcite and @xcite also obtain @xmath8 values less than the kolmogorov value for psr b0329 + 54 and several other pulsars .",
    "our result also agrees well with that from @xcite who obtain a structure function slope of @xmath104 from their flux density monitoring of this pulsar .",
    "however , it contrasts with that of @xcite where a structure function slope @xmath105 is derived from observations at several different frequencies and interpreted in terms of weak plasma turbulence , again with a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "quasi - continuous observations of psr b0329 + 54 at 1540 mhz over 20 days have been analysed to investigate the refractive modulations of the pulsar flux density and diffractive scintillation parameters .",
    "the data set was split into more than 150 individual observations , each of 90-min duration , and two - dimensional auto - correlations and secondary spectra computed .",
    "time series of the pulsar flux density ( @xmath16 ) , decorrelation bandwidth ( @xmath28 ) , diffractive scintillation time - scale ( @xmath19 ) and drift rate of features in the dynamic spectra ( @xmath46 ) clearly show refractive modulation , although no evidence for arc structure is seen in the secondary spectra .    observed cross - correlations between variations in the flux density and diffractive parameters were much smaller than predictions based on the thin - screen model .",
    "in one case the sign of the correlation was opposite to the predicted value .",
    "similar results have been obtained by other observers although different observations appear to give conflicting results .    in accordance with previous work , observed modulation indices are greater than predicted for a thin screen with a kolmogorov fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this could be accounted for either by a steeper fluctuation spectrum ( @xmath106 ) or by scattering in an extended medium .",
    "the predicted modulation index for a scattering medium covering the whole path to the pulsar is greater than that observed , suggesting that the scattering medium , while extended , does not cover the whole path .",
    "structure functions derived from the observations indicate a short refractive timescale , @xmath0  h , much less than predicted from the thin screen model , and have a relatively flat slope , @xmath1 , again inconsistent with scattering by a thin screen .",
    "the observed modulation indices , structure function slopes and short refractive timescales all are consistent with scattering by an extended region with a kolmogorov fluctuation spectrum which is concentrated toward the pulsar .",
