    "quantum key distribution(qkd)@xcite enables two legitimate communication participants , alice and bob , to share identical keys based on the fundamental laws of quantum physics . it has been a kind of information security technology raised from modern cryptography and quantum mechanics .",
    "qkd can be considered the most important application of quantum physics .",
    "many papers have proven the security of bennett - brassard-1984(bb84 ) protocol@xcite .",
    "subsequently the experimental implementation also made great progress@xcite .",
    "so far , commercial products have already become available .",
    "however , due to the symmetry of bb84 protocol , the phase error rate is equal to the bit error rate . needing to estimate the amount of leaked information by randomly sampling the signal , bb84 protocol may overestimate the leaked information and limit the threshold of the error rate .    recently ,",
    "a quantum key distribution protocol called round - robin differential phase - shift(rrdps ) was proposed by sasaki et al.@xcite , which can generate keys without monitoring signal disturbance of the measurement outcomes and has no restriction on the error rate@xcite .",
    "rrdps is a novel method to encode raw key bits even with the existence of eavesdropper , in which bob specifies randomly how to calculate the sifted key from the raw key bits .",
    "due to the large number of pulses in a packet , rrdps system has higher stability and lower loss .",
    "it can tolerate a noisier channel than the conventional one .",
    "up to now , many modified schemes have been proposed and several experimental demonstrations have been performed@xcite . using a receiver set - up to randomly choose one of four interferometers with different delays , takesue",
    "et al.@xcite reported a proof - of - principle qkd experiment based on rrdps protocol .",
    "wang et al.@xcite demonstrated an active implementation of this protocol , and their system can distribute secret keys over a distance of 90 km .",
    "implementation results show that the protocol is feasible with current technology , especially in high - error situations@xcite .",
    "similar to the standard qkd protocol , most researches of rrdps use weak coherent pulses(wcps ) as a replacement of the perfect single - photon source .",
    "heralded single photon source ( hsps ) , is also within reach of current technology and can be considered as the candidate of the perfect single - photon source .",
    "so the performance of this source in rrdps remains to be further studied .    in bb84 protocol",
    ", decoy - state method@xcite can be used to efficiently estimate the contribution of the single - photon pulse and significantly increase the transmission distance of secure keys .",
    "many researchers have studied the practicability of decoy - state method .",
    "@xcite first studied the statistical fluctuation analysis for the decoy state .",
    "similarly , zhang et al.@xcite proposed the infinite decoy - state method for rrdps . their method is valid in the asymptotic limit with an infinite number of decoy states , thus it has some limitations in practice .",
    "we extend it to the practical case with a finite number of decoy states .",
    "first of all , we compare the performance of wcps and hsps in different pulse packet lengths .",
    "then , fixing the packet length at 32 , we simulate the infinite decoy - state method using these two sources .",
    "since infinite decoy - state method is difficult to achieve in practice , we put forward a finite decoy - state protocol .",
    "taking wcps as an example , bounds on the yields and quantum bit error rates of some photon number states are stated . at last , considering that contributions from three and more photons are not obvious , we employ three - intensity decoy - state method .",
    "* round - robin differential - phase - shift protocol *    the round - robin differential - phase - shift protocol encodes raw key bits coherently so that only a few bits can be read out at the same time .",
    "it is hard for eve to guess the sifted key .",
    "the ideal protocol , between two legitimate users , alice and bob , runs as follows .",
    "state preparation .",
    "alice prepares packets of pulses containing @xmath2 pulses , and generates a random @xmath2-bit sequence , @xmath3 .",
    "then she encodes the sequence into the phase of each pulse , 0(when @xmath4 ) or @xmath5(when @xmath6 ) , and sends the pulse packets to bob .",
    "we consider that the encoded signal is a superposition photon state of pulses@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the encoded bit sequence , @xmath9 denotes that the photon is in the @xmath10-th pulse .    \\2 . measurement . upon receiving the states ,",
    "bob randomly sets the pulse delay value @xmath11 , and splits each received l - pulse train into two",
    ". then bob delays one of the train and interferes with the other . after measuring interference between the two trains ,",
    "the detection result shows the phase difference between two pulses @xmath12 and@xmath13 @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "the value of the relative phase @xmath16 is a sifted key of bob .",
    "\\3 . sifting .",
    "bob announces @xmath17 to alice through classical channel , so that alice computes @xmath18 as her sifted key .",
    "\\4 . post processing .",
    "alice and bob repeat steps 1 - 3 to accumulate enough sifted key .",
    "they perform error correction and privacy amplification on the sifted key to extract the final secure key .",
    "the sketch of the protocol is shown in the figure 1 .",
    "the secure key length of qkd protocol is given by @xcite @xmath19 \\label{equ1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the sifted key length , @xmath21 corresponds to the efficiency of error correction , and @xmath22 is the binary shannon entropy function .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the bit error rate and phase error rate respectively .    as for rrdps protocol , the phase error rate depends on the preparation of quantum states rather than the transmission process . when the number of photons in a packet is no more than an integer @xmath25 , in the analysis of sasaki et al .",
    ", the phase error rate can be bounded by @xmath26 @xcite . while they assume that eve completely knows the sifted key bits from the rest part(@xmath27 ) .",
    "zhang et al.@xcite improved the phase error estimation by considering the encoding details of the quantum signal .",
    "the phase error rate is given by @xmath28 when the number of photons satisfies @xmath29 , phase error rate can be bounded by @xmath30 , which accords a tighter and more reasonable bound on the phase error rate .    hence , the improved phase error rate estimation of source satisfying @xmath31 is expressed by@xcite @xmath32 where q is the empirical rate of detection @xmath33 , and @xmath34 corresponds to the number of packets emitted from alice .",
    "there are @xmath35 rounds satisfying the number of photons @xmath27 , which are regarded as a phase error in the worst case scenario .",
    "so the first term of this equation stands for the fraction of phase error rate where the photons in a packet have exceeded @xmath36 , and the second one refers to that of packets whose photons are no larger than @xmath36 .    on account of this classification",
    ", the secure key rate per packet can be calculated to be@xcite @xmath37    the former part is the contribution of packets containing photons exceeding @xmath36 , while the latter one is that of packets containing photons no more than @xmath36 . from this equation , it is clear that the larger l is , the higher secure key rate of per packet we can obtain .    * finite decoy - state rrdps protocol *    decoy - state method@xcite has been proposed as a useful method to improve the performance of qkd protocols when using an imperfect single - photon source .",
    "similarly , the decoy - state for rrdps protocol also have been employed@xcite .",
    "here , we review the idea of decoy - state rrdps",
    ".    denote @xmath38 to be the overall gain when the source intensity is @xmath39 , and @xmath40 to be the ratio of key rate that is sacrificed in privacy amplification . according to eq.([equ1 ] ) , the final key rate of per packet can also be written as @xcite @xmath41 .",

    "the amount of key loss can be calculated as@xcite @xmath47    @xmath42 can not be measured directly , but we can accurately estimate it with infinite decoy states . without the interference of eve , it is given by@xcite @xmath48    and the error rate @xmath49 can be obtained from@xcite @xmath50}}{{{y_n}}}.   \\label{equ10}\\ ] ]    in practice , the number of decoy states can not be chosen freely . as the number of intensity increases , the enforcement of the protocol may be more challengeable .",
    "so it is worthy to study finite decoy - state method .",
    "for practical implementations , since contributions from states with large photon numbers are negligible comparing with those from small photon numbers , only a few decoy states will be sufficient .",
    "the final key rate can be rewritten as @xmath51 where @xmath42 is defined to be the yield of an n - photon state , @xmath52 refers to the possibility of n photons when the mean number is @xmath53 , @xmath21 corresponds to the efficiency of error correction , and @xmath54 is the binary shannon entropy function .",

    "are also contributed to the secret key in rrdps , we propose finite decoy - state to estimate @xmath58 and @xmath59 , that is @xmath60 . here",
