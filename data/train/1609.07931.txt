    "@xcite , the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite has been revisited under the assumption that the attraction band is asymmetric with respect to the chemical potential of the system .",
    "this asymmetry changes dramatically the phenomenology of the superconducting phase : a quasiparticle imbalance appears in equilibrium , the energy gap and the critical temperature change , there are several solutions for the gap equation , and , most significantly , the normal metal - superconductor phase transition becomes of the first order .",
    "if the attraction band  i.e . the single - particle energy interval in which the pairing interaction is manifested ",
    "is denoted by @xmath11 $ ] and the chemical potential is denoted by @xmath0 , then the standard bcs phenomenology is recovered only if @xmath12 . if @xmath13 , the energy gap and the populations of the quasiparticle energy levels are calculated by solving a system of integral equations . as we shall see further , this system may have several solutions at fixed temperature and chemical potential .",
    "quasiparticle imbalance in the context of the bcs theory have been reported before for non - equilibrium superconductors ( see for example refs .",
    "such non - equilibrium situations can be described also by our approach , but here we focus only on equilibrium superconductivity .",
    "equilibrium quasiparticle imbalance @xcite appears also in the model of hole superconductivity @xcite , but the concept and the predictions of this model are , in many respects , very different from the bcs theory .",
    "we do not make here comparisons between different models .",
    "the effect of pressure on the superconducting properties have been studied for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a bell - shaped dependence of the critical temperature on the pressure applied to the sample was observed .",
    "if the relative position of the chemical potential with respect to the middle of the attraction band can be monotonically changed by the applied pressure , then a similar dependence of the critical temperature would appear in our model also @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the basic equations , from ref .",
    "@xcite . in the third section we present the low temperature limit of these equations and their solutions . in the forth section we present the conclusions .",
    "for simplicity , we work in the quasicontinuous limit and we denote by @xmath14 the energy of the free electrons . if the attraction band ( or the conduction band , if this is included into the attraction band ) @xmath11 $ ] is centered at @xmath1 , then we denote the chemical potential of the system by @xmath0 and we introduce the usual notation @xmath15 ( see ref .",
