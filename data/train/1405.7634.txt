    "we write this condition as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the lower and upper energies within which @xmath57 . within this range ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 is controlled by varying the fermi energy @xmath1 , typically by applying a gate voltage to the sample which interacts with the conduction electrons via the electric field effect  @xcite .",
    "if the graphene - adatom system is neutral and no voltage is applied , @xmath1 will be constrained to have a particular value controlled by the charge neutrality condition .",

    "[ fig1](b ) we plot @xmath50 versus @xmath1 for several values of @xmath53 , with other parameters the same as the h - graphene system .",

    "the maximum value of @xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) the maximum value of @xmath70 for @xmath71 , while in fig .  [ fig1]c a maximum value of @xmath72 for @xmath73 . in previous work",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the numerical results of fig .  [ fig1 ] can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "if the system of graphene plus adatom has a net magnetic moment , then the partial densities of states @xmath76 and @xmath77 will be different .",
    "the total magnetic moment is then obtained by integrating these two densities of states up to @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 lies below the bottom edge of the lower band , there will be no net magnetic moment .",
    "the moment becomes non - zero at the energy @xmath78 when @xmath1 moves above the bottom of the lower band .",
    "it reaches its maximum when @xmath1 lies somewhere between the peaks in @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( assuming the two bands overlap ) , and thereafter decreases until it becomes zero at @xmath79 , the energy above which both sub - bands are filled .",
    "thus , for any choice of the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath53 , and @xmath39 , there should be a finite range of @xmath1 , within which @xmath57 .",
    "of course , this description is an oversimplification because the self - consistently determined @xmath76 and @xmath77 depend on the quantities @xmath38 ( @xmath17 ) , which themselves depend on @xmath0 . however , even with the oversimplification , the qualitative description remains correct .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 depends , in part , on how much the two sub - bands overlap .",
    "if the overlap is large , maximum of @xmath0 will be small , everything else being equal , while a small overlap will tend to produce a larger @xmath0 .",
    "another reason why @xmath0 is reduced below @xmath49 is that there is generally a large electron transfer from the adatom onto the graphene sheet@xcite .",
    "we also note that the energy range , @xmath80 , where @xmath57 is approximately equal to the width of the extra density of states due to the adatom .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath1 can be controlled experimentally in several ways .",
    "one is to apply a suitable gate voltage @xmath81 , which raises or lowers @xmath1 by an amount @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the magnitude of the electronic charge .",
    "another is by chemical doping : if one adds or subtracts charge carriers to the graphene - adatom system by doping with suitable molecules , this will also raise or lower @xmath1 as was done in ref .  .",
    "one could also add a small number of vacancies in the graphene , as also done in ref .  .",
    "this will reduce the number of charge carriers and hence lower @xmath1 . of course , vacancies would also change the graphene density of states ; so the present calculations would have to be modified to treat this situation .",
    "the model used here treats only the effects of adatoms on graphene , but it does qualitatively reproduce the upper energy cutoff found in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "for example , nair _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found an upper cutoff of around @xmath84 , which we can approximately obtain by assuming an on - site energy @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , our model does not account for the onset energy found in ref .",
    "@xcite of @xmath88 since in our model the bottom edge of the lower band occurs at @xmath89 .    in summary , by",
    "using a simple tight - binding model of adatoms on graphene we are able to calculate the total magnetic moment of graphene with a small concentration adatoms as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the model is expected to apply to the case of h adatoms , but could also be applicable to other adatom species , characterized by different model parameters . the fermi energy @xmath1 can be controlled experimentally by a suitable gate voltage .",
    "our results show that , for realistic tight - binding parameters ( @xmath90 ) , the magnetic moment can be switched off at a relatively low voltage ( @xmath91 ) , in rough agreement with the experiments of ref .  .",
    "these results are potentially of much interest since they suggest that the magnetic moment of graphene with adatoms can be electrically controlled .",
