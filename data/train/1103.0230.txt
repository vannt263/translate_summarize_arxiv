    "quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum superdense coding @xcite , and some important quantum cryptographic schemes @xcite , which are the completion of most fundamental quantum communication processes involving bipartite entanglement , need the complete and deterministic analysis of the bell states .",
    "for instance , in the well - known teleportation protocol @xcite , an unknown qubit state may be teleproted between two parties over a long distance as long as each of them possesses one particle in an entangled photon pair and then the sender , alice , makes an appropriate joint measurement on her particle in an unknown state and one of the pair shared with the receiver bob . unfortunately , with only linear optical elements , a complete bell - state analysis ( bsa )",
    "is impossible and one can only get the optimal success probability of @xmath0 @xcite . in the optimal optical bsa scheme realized experimentally , its success probability is only 50% @xcite .",
    "hyperentanglement @xcite , the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree of freedom , such as polarization - momentum , polarization - time - bin , and polarization- and spatial - modes - energy - time , can be used to assist the complete bell - state discrimination @xcite .",
    "for instance , kwait and weinfurter @xcite first discussed the way to distinguish the four orthogonal bell states with both momentum entanglements and polarization entanglements . in 2003 , walborn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a simple scheme for complete bell - state measurement for photons using hyperentangled states . in their protocol , they performed the polarization bsa by using momentum entanglement as an ancilla .",
    "they also showed that the polarization states can be used to distinguish the momentum bell states .",
    "the experiments of a complete bsa have also been reported with polarization - time - bin hyperentanglement @xcite and polarization - momentum hyperentanglement @xcite . in 2008 , kwait _ et al . _",
    "beat the channel capacity limit for linear photonic superdense coding with polarization - orbital angular momentum hyperentanglement @xcite .",
    "in essence , a bsa in the polarization degree of freedom with hyperentanglement works in a larger hilbert space by introducing other degrees of freedom .    if we consider a large hilbert space with an additional degree of freedom , the case is quite different . for a quantum system in a hyerentangled state in two degrees of freedom",
    ", it has 16 orthogonal bell states . with linear optics",
    "only , one can not distinguish them completely .",
    "for instance , the momentum entanglement can be used to distinguish the four polarization bell states completely , but the momentum entanglement itself can not be distinguished well . in 2007 , wei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that one can only distinguish 7 states in the group of 16 orthogonal bell states .",
    "if we consider each photon in @xmath1 qubit - like degrees of freedom , there are , in total , @xmath2 bell - like states for each two - photon quantum system .",
    "_ @xcite also extended their result and showed that the upper bound of the maximal number of mutually distinguishable bell - like states is @xmath3 , as is true for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in this article , we present a complete hyperentanglement bsa ( hbsa ) with cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the hyperentangled state we discussed comprises the entanglement with two different kinds of degrees of freedom , that is , polarization and spatial modes .",
    "this hbsa scheme can be divided into two steps .",
    "the first step is used to distinguish the bell states in spatial modes but not destroy the two photons . with this step , one can not only read the information about the bell states in spatial modes , but also confirm the outports of the two photons , which provides useful information for the bsa in polarization .",
    "this task should resort to quantum nondemolition detectors ( qnds ) . in the second step",
    ", one can first divide the four bell states in polarization into two groups according to their parities , that is , the even - parity states and the odd - parity states with qnd , and then distinguish the two bell states in each group with two hadamard operations and two parity - check measurements .",
    "this hbsa protocol can be used in quantum teleportation of a single - particle system in an unknown state in the polarization and spatial - mode degrees of freedom . also , it has a good application in hyperentanglement swapping of a hyerentangled state in two different degrees of freedom .",
    "these applications will increase the channel capacity in long - distance quantum communication .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we explain the principle of the present hbsa scheme .",
    "it is divided into two steps .",
    "one is used to distinguish the four bell states in the spatial - mode degree of freedom with qnds , which is discussed in sec.ii a. the other is used to analyze the four bell states in the polarization degree of freedom , including a parity - check measurement with qnd and another one with linear optical elements , shown in sec.ii b. in sec.iii , we discuss the applications of the present hbsa scheme in long - distance quantum communication ; that is , a hyperentanglement teleportation scheme and a hyperentanglement - swapping scheme are discussed in sec.iii a and b , respectively .",
    "a discussion and a summary are given in sec.iv .",
    "the previous works indicated that qnds with a cross - kerr medium and a coherent state can be used for operating the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate @xcite and single - photon logic gates with minimal sources @xcite , entanglement purification and concentration @xcite ; generating high - quality entanglement @xcite , and qubits @xcite ; and analyzing the bell states with the polarization degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "in general , cross - kerr nonlinearities can be described with the hamiltonian as @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation operations , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the creation operations .",
    "@xmath11 is the coupling strength of the nonlinearity and it is decided by the property of the nonlinear material .",
    "if we consider a single - photon state @xmath12 and a coherent state @xmath13 , the cross - kerr interaction causes the combined system composed of a single photon and a coherent state evolve as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fock states which means the states contain 0 and 1 photon , respectively . here",
    "the phase shift @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the interaction time which is directly proportional to the number of photons with the single - photon state being unaffected . in 2005 , barratt _ et al .",
    "_ performed a polarization bsa with qnd @xcite .",
    "they first used the qnd to construct the parity - check measurement .",
    "now we will work with a hyperentangled two - photon state with the form @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the horizontal and the vertical polarizations , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the two photons in the hyperentangled state .",
    "the subscript @xmath23 denotes the polarization degree of freedom and @xmath24 is the spatial - mode degree of freedom . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the different spatial modes for photon @xmath27 , shown in fig.1 .",
    "the state of eq.(3 ) can be easily produced with a parametric down - conversion source .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pump pulse comes from below and traverses a nonlinear @xmath28 barium borate ( bbo ) crystal , where it can produce the entangled state into the modes @xmath29 , then it is reflected and traverses the bbo crystal twice to produce entangled pairs in the modes @xmath30 .",
    "the photon pairs also are entangled in the polarization degree of freedom . that is , each photon pair is in the hyperentangled state @xmath31 .",
    "we denote four bell states in the polarization degree of freedom as @xmath32 and @xmath33 as the even - parity states , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the odd - parity states .",
    "an appealing advantage of the hyperentangled product states with the form of eq.([hyperentanglement ] ) is that state in the two degrees of freedom can be well operated independently .",
    "for example , if we manipulate the polarization bell states using some local operations , such as a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) or a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , we will leave the spatial - mode entangled state unchanged .",
    "meanwhile , if we operate the spatial - mode bell states , the polarization bell states remain unchanged too .",
    "this feature provides us an effective way of achieving hbsa .",
    "that is , one can perform the polarization bsa and spatial - mode bell - state analysis independently .",
    "the spatial - mode entanglement no longer acts as an ancilla for the polarization bsa .",
    "therefore , a hbsa can be divided into two steps .",
    "the first step is used for the spatial - mode bsa and the second is for polarization .",
    "the precondition for this scheme being well realized is that of nondestructive measurement , as one can not operate polarization bsa any more if the photons are detected and destroyed .",
    "fortunately , cross - kerr nonlinearities provide us a powerful tool for accomplishing qnds .     from the odd - parity states @xmath36 .",
    "the action of first cross - kerr nonlinearity puts a phase shift @xmath37 on the coherent probe beam if a photon appears in the mode coupled .",
    "the second cross - kerr nonlinearity puts a phase shift with @xmath38 .",
    "after the nonlinear interactions , the probe beam picks up the phase shift @xmath37 or @xmath38 if the state is @xmath39 or @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "otherwise , the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 pick up no phase shifts.,width=257 ]    the principle of the present hbsa protocol for spatial - mode entangled bell states is shown in fig.1 and fig.2 . with the first qnd shown in fig.1 , the state @xmath33 with the coherent state @xmath13 evolves as @xmath43 but the state @xmath35 with the coherent state @xmath13 evolves as @xmath44 one can observe immediately that the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 pick up no phase shifts and maintain the coherence with respect to each other .",
    "however , the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 pick up the phase shifts @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "if we choose an x quadrature measurement on the coherent beam , with which the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 can not be distinguished @xcite , we can distinguish @xmath33 and @xmath35 with different phase shifts by homodyne - heterodyne measurements .",
    "this qnd detector is a parity - checking device which can distinguish the even - parity states @xmath33 from the odd - parity states @xmath35 .",
    "( @xmath47 ) represent four different cross - kerr nonlinear media with the phase shifts @xmath48 .",
    "this qnd is used to distinguish the four spatial modes @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with the phase shifts @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively . when the two photons appear at the spatial modes @xmath49 or @xmath50 ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) , they are originally in the bell state @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) if the phase shift in the first qnd is @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the result is kept for the state @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) when the phase shift in the first qnd is zero . completing the bsa with the first and the second qnds , the outports of the two photons are determinate , which provides useful information for the analysis of the bell states in the polarization degree of freedom.,width=302 ]    with the first qnd ,",
    "the four bell states in spatial modes are divided into two groups @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the next task of bsa in spatial modes is to distinguish the different phases in each group .",
    "the second qnd is used to distinguish the bell state with the phase zero and the bell state with the phase @xmath63 , shown in fig.2 . a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs )",
    "can accomplish the following transformation in the spatial modes : latexmath:[\\ ] ] if alice obtains the outcome @xmath134 , the two photons located in nodes @xmath106 and @xmath130 will be in the hyperentangled state @xmath135 .",
    "the outcomes will lead to the other hyperentangled states , such as @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , it is , in principle , not difficult for bob and charlie to transform their hyperentangled states into the form @xmath141 .",
    "for instance , if bob and charlie obtain the state @xmath142 , they can obtain the state @xmath143 in the way that charlie performs an operation @xmath144 in polarization ( the two spatial modes , i.e. , the two paths @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) and then exchanges the two spatial modes after he introduces a phase @xmath63 in the spatial mode @xmath145 with a @xmath127 wave plate .    in essence , the present hyperentanglement - swapping protocol can be divided into two processes , that is the entangled swapping for entanglement states in polarization and that in spatial modes .",
    "each entanglement - swapping process is independent of the other .",
    "meanwhile , they must be swapped simultaneously .",
    "if we only perform the bell - state measurement on photons @xmath112 and @xmath122 in the polarization degree of freedom , photons @xmath106 and @xmath130 will be entangled in the polarization degree of freedom but their state in spatial modes may be a mixed one ..",
    "a hyperentangled bsa is far different from a hyperentanglement - assisted bsa as the latter is used to only analyze the bell states in the polarization degree of freedom and the other degree of freedom , such as momentum and time - bin , is an additional auxiliary system and is consumed in the analysis .",
    "this hbsa protocol shows that with cross - kerr nonlinearity , one can also perform a complete hbsa . during a hbsa process",
    ", the entanglements in different degrees of freedom can be manipulated independently . the key element in this scheme is qnd as it provides us the way to manipulate the photons but not destroy them .",
    "this protocol also reveals that complete hbsa with only linear optical elements is also impossible .    in the process of describing the principle of our hbsa scheme",
    ", we mainly exploit the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the parity - check gate .",
    "we should acknowledge that although a lot of works have been studied on cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite , a clean cross - kerr nonlinearity in the optical single - photon regime is still quite a controversial assumption , especially with current technology . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kok _ et al .",
    "_ showed that operating in the optical single - photon regime , the kerr phase shift is only @xmath147 .",
    "with electromagnetically induced transparent materials , cross - kerr nonlinearities of @xmath148 can be obtained . as pointed out by gea - banacloche @xcite recently ,",
    "the large phase shifts via the giant kerr effect with single - photon wave packets is impossible at present .",
    "these results also agree with the previous works by shapiro and razavi @xcite .",
    "the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity will make the phase shifts @xmath69 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath149 of the coherent state become extremely small , which will be hard to detect .",
    "that is to say , using homodyne detector , it is difficult to determine the phase shift due to the impossible discrimination of two overlapping coherent states , which will decrease the success probability of the present hbsa scheme . in 2003 , hofmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a phase shift of @xmath63 can be achieved with a single two - level atom in a one - sided cavity . in 2010 , wittmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated quantum measurement strategies capable of discriminating two coherent states using a homodyne detector and a photon - number - resolving ( pnr ) detector . in order to lower the error probability ,",
    "the postselection strategy is applied to the measurement data of homodyne detector as well as a pnr detector .",
    "they showed that the performance of the new displacement - controlled pnr is better than that of a homodyne receiver .",
    "that is , the present hbsa scheme may be feasible if we choose a suitable kerr nonlinear media and some good quantum measurement strategies on coherent beams .",
    "moreover , quantum gates based on optical nonlinearities have attracted a lot of attention @xcite in recent years , which will impel the development of optical nonlinearity techniques .",
    "in fact , the present hbsa scheme requires that the positive and negative signs in the phase shifts of the coherent beam can not be distinguished .",
    "that is , it is unnecessary for us to have interaction - induced phases of both positive and negative sign in the present scheme . here a cross - kerr nonlinearity in qnds is only used to make a parity check for two photons and other elements can also be used to construct qnds @xcite for this hbsa scheme .    in summary , we have proposed a complete hbsa scheme with cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we use the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct parity - check measurements and analyze bell states in different degrees of freedom of photons .",
    "we also discussed its applications in quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping in two different degrees of freedom simultaneously .",
    "we concluded that one can teleport a particle in more than one degree of freedom if a hyperentanglement channel is set up and a hyperentanglement bell - state measurement is permitted perfectly .",
    "we also revealed that quantum communication based on hyperentanglement is possible as we can set up a hyperentanglement quantum channel for a long - distance quantum communication with hyperentanglement swapping .",
    "all these results may be useful in practical applications in quantum information .",
