    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) , as a significant graphene - related material , has attracted much attentions @xcite due to its unusual electronic structure .",
    "formed by stacking two monolayer graphene ( mlg ) in bernal stacking , bilayer graphene has four inequivalent sites in each unit cell , including @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms on the top layer and @xmath2 and @xmath3 atoms on the bottom layer .",
    "the distance @xmath4 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is about @xmath5 nm and the vertical separation of the two layers @xmath6 is about @xmath7 nm . on its band structure side , around the point where the conduction and valence band touch , blg has a quadratic energy dispersion @xcite similar to the regular two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) but its low - energy effective hamiltonian is chiral without bandgap similar to the mlg .",
    "another unique feature of blg is that a widely tunable bandgap can realize conveniently by introducing an electrostatic potential bias between the up and bottom layer @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of electronic systems comes from two contribution : one is pauli paramagnetism which stems from spin polarization ; the other is landau diamagnetism which stems from the circulation of orbital currents .",
    "the orbital diamagnetism of carbon systems has attracted the interest of both experimental and theoretical physicists for a long time .",
    "it was firstly found by krishnan @xcite that the diamagnetic susceptibility of the bulk graphite is large and anisotropic .",
    "mcclure @xcite showed it arises from the landau quantization of 2d massless dirac fermions , which results in a delta function peak at zero energy in the orbital diamagnetism of graphite .",
    "after the experimentally fabrication of graphene , a great deal of works have concerned about the orbital magnetism of graphene - related systems , such as nodal fermions @xcite , disordered graphene @xcite , few - layered graphene @xcite , graphene in nonuniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "quite recently , novel paramagnetic susceptibility has been found in mlg and blg with bandgap @xcite and doped graphene to the first order in the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "safran @xcite , koshino and ando @xcite have derived the analytical expression of orbital susceptibility @xmath8 for bilayer graphene , but their results are just limited to the case of zero wave number . in this article",
