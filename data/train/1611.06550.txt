    "we apply the linearization technique to the previous langevin equations , which is an approximate method that we proved to lead to the correct predictions when working sufficiently above threshold @xcite .",

    "however , in our case the equations are invariant under changes of the phase difference between the laguerre - gauss modes , @xmath16 , what means that there is a direction in phase space in which fluctuations are not damped , and hence they can not be assumed small .",
    "this is the main reason why we use this positive _ p _ formalism , since the linearization can still be performed by taking into account the fluctuations of the phase @xmath16 explicitly ( which is not clear how to do in the heisenberg picture , where the phase - difference operator has a very complicated expression @xcite ) .",

    "the classical solution has the form introduced in the main text , we proceed by writing the stochastic variables as      where the phase @xmath188 is taken as an explicit stochastic variable whose fluctuations account for the quantum fluctuations of the corresponding phase difference operator .",

    "now , note that the fokker - planck equation associated to this stochastic equations is independent of @xmath16 @xcite , and hence , we can take @xmath203 without loss of generality .      using ( [ rhoveceqs ] ) and the various definitions above",

    "let us consider the mode with the same temporal profile as the bright mode generated classically , but in a tem@xmath40 mode spatially orthogonal to the bright tem@xmath15 one .",
    "we referred to this as the _ dark mode _ , and its corresponding stochastic amplitudes within the positive _ p _ representation are given by      in the following , we will prove that an output quadrature of this mode is perfectly squeezed at any pump level above threshold . to this aim ,",

    "<S> synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators ( spopos ) are optical cavities containing a nonlinear crystal capable of down - converting a frequency comb to lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> these have received a lot of attention lately , because their intrinsic multimode nature makes them compact sources of quantum correlated light with promising applications in modern quantum information technologies . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that spopos are also capable of accessing the challenging but interesting regime where spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in the quantum properties of the emitted light , difficult to access with any other nonlinear optical cavity . apart from opening the possibility of studying experimentally this elusive regime of dissipative phase transitions </S>",
    "<S> , our predictions will have a practical impact , since we show that spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a specific spatiotemporal mode with perfect squeezing for any value of the system parameters , turning spopos into robust sources of highly nonclassical light above threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction. * to date , optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) constitute the main source of nonclassical states of light , finding numerous applications in emerging quantum technologies , e.g. in the fields of quantum metrology @xcite or quantum information with continuous variables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> opos are optical cavities containing nonlinear crystals supporting the so - called parametric down conversion ( pdc ) process , by means of which a pump photon of frequency @xmath0 is converted into a pair of photons of frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( so - called , arbitrarily in the opo case , signal and idler ) , and vice - versa , with @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this generates strong quantum correlations between signal and idler ( e.g. twin beams @xcite ) the pdc hamiltonian reads @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 annihilate photons of the corresponding cavity modes , @xmath6 is a coupling constant proportional to the nonlinear susceptibility and to the spatial overlap between the modes inside the nonlinear crystal , and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the phase mismatch , being @xmath9 the crystal length and @xmath10 the wavenumber inside the crystal whose refractive index at frequency @xmath11 is @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , perfect phase matching ) maximizes pdc , and usually selects which pair of signal - idler modes are efficiently generated .    </S>",
    "<S> traditionally opos are operated under monochromatic pumping ( a single @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the parametric gain must compensate for cavity loss , a main feature of opos in the classical limit is the existence of a pumping threshold below which there is no emission , while above it a macroscopic field is excited in one specific signal - idler couple . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a fully quantum - mechanical theory accounts for the generation of photon pairs for any signal - idler couple satisfying energy and momentum conservation , even below threshold </S>",
    "<S> . however signal - idler modes of different couples do not show quantum correlations among them because the pump provides no appreciable feedback , since below threshold it is almost undepleted , while above the threshold its intracavity amplitude gets clamped to its threshold value @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> equal to the opo roundtrip time . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is transparent for the pump and tuned to the first transverse mode family at the subharmonic . </S>",
    "<S> ( top ) the pump beam has a gaussian transverse profile , but classical down - conversion takes place in a tem@xmath15 mode with arbitrary orientation @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ( bottom ) pump and signal frequency combs with spectral - line spacing @xmath17 , and some of the down - conversion channels of two of the pump lines , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the situation changes dramatically when the pump comes from a mode - locked laser whose cavity roundtrip time matches the opo one , @xmath20 : synchronously pumped opos , or spopos , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> such multimode pump field consists of an infinite train of identical coherent pulses separated by @xmath20 , known alternatively as a _ frequency comb _ as its spectrum consists of discrete spectral lines separated by @xmath21 , so - called cavity free spectral range . as in the monochromatic pump case </S>",
    "<S> , each pump spectral line generates multiple couples of signal - idler photons and , what is the new key ingredient , any signal / idler photon can be created by any of the different pump lines , what leads to massive quantum correlations between signal - idler photons at different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> special interest are receiving degenerate type i spopos @xcite , in which signal and idler have the same linear polarization and the perfect phase matching condition ( @xmath14 ) happens for @xmath22 , a condition achieved by proper crystal orientation and/or temperature tuning . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a single frequency comb around the subharmonic frequency @xmath23 is generated and the distinction between signal and idler photons is completely superfluous ; hence we will refer to any subharmonic photon as a signal photon for brevity . in order to understand why such spopos have so remarkable quantum properties , let us analyze their interaction hamiltonian which can be written as @xcite @xmath24 where in the following we denote by @xmath25 the annihilation operator of a pump photon of frequency @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the annihilation operator of a signal photon of frequency @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath30 $ ] is the phase - mismatch factor , and we assumed a common value for the coupling constant @xmath31 for any pdc channel , which is an excellent approximation @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this has enormous consequences : on one hand classical correlations appear ( all signal modes get phase - locked , giving rise to well - defined trains of identical pulses separated by @xmath34 ) , and on the other hand strong quantum correlations are built up , leading to highly multimode squeezing @xcite and multipartite entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recent experiments have proven spopos to be highly versatile sources of nonclassical light @xcite , with foreseen applications in quantum computation @xcite and communication @xcite .    a neat way of analyzing the quantum dynamics of spopos below threshold is by introducing the so - called `` supermodes '' @xcite , coherent superposition of cavity modes , which are special frequency combs that diagonalize the nonlinear interaction in which clean quantum properties are concentrated . defining the annihilation operators @xmath35 for these supermodes , hamiltonian ( [ hint0 ] ) becomes @xmath36 ( see the paragraph before eq . </S>",

    "<S> the strong multimode quantum field generated by spopos is _ critical _ in the sense that its nonclassicality is maximized at threshold , but it is rapidly degraded as the system is pumped further @xcite , exactly as it happens with any nonlinear optical cavity where squeezing is linked with the presence of bifurcations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extending those features above threshold will improve the performance and reliability of these sources .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ hint0 ] ) describes the usual case of a degenerate spopo in which both the pump and signal modes have a gaussian transverse profile . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , it has been predicted in the context of a degenerate opo pumped by a monochromatic gaussian beam , that when the cavity is tuned to the first transverse mode family at the subharmonic frequency @xcite , the signal field displays a level of squeezing above threshold which equals that at threshold @xcite , i.e. , the squeezing production in this case is _ noncritical </S>",

    "<S> the physics behind such a remarkable result lies in the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking around the cavity axis brought about by the ( above - threshold ) classical field , which necessarily has the shape of a tem@xmath15 mode of arbitrary orientation because of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) conservation ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the goal of this letter is to show that type i spopos in which the cavity is tuned to the first transverse mode family at the subharmonic are true noncritical sources of squeezed frequency combs above threshold , as well as perfect platforms for the study of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking .    </S>",

    "<S> the pump comes from a mode - locked laser with gaussian transverse profile , while the cavity is tuned so that only the first family of transverse modes is present at frequencies @xmath41 , meaning that the down - converted photons can only take the profile of the lowest order laguerre - gauss modes with @xmath42 oam . assuming as usual that the resonator rayleigh length is much larger than the crystal length </S>",

    "<S> ( [ langevineqs ] ) have the symmetry @xmath77 ( with @xmath16 an arbitrary phase ) , the collective phase difference between opposite oam modes is not fixed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the pumping amplitudes @xmath60 are real ( non - chirped pulses ) , experimental and theoretical analysis on standard gaussian spopos @xcite have shown that there exist a large parameter region where the phases of the spectral components get locked to 0 or @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this carries on to the phase sums between opposite oam modes in our model , leading to a stationary solution @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath16 an arbitrary phase . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ esignal ] ) and ( [ uml ] ) then provide a classical field @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a hermite - gauss , or tem@xmath15 , transverse mode rotated by an angle @xmath16 with respect to the @xmath83 axis , and @xmath84 . hence , the spatiotemporal shape of the signal mean field emitted above threshold is the simple product of some propagating ( wave ) profile given by @xmath85 ( the phase - locked frequency comb ) and a tem@xmath15 transverse spatial mode given by @xmath86 , which breaks the rotational symmetry of the system .    * quantum properties of the emitted field. * in previous works </S>",

    "<S> the analysis requires a rather technical procedure based the positive _ p _ representation @xcite , and hence we present it in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the presence of a noncritically squeezed mode in the system can be proven without resorting to such a rigorous analysis , and , for the sake of simplicity , in the following we just assume that above - threshold emission happens in a stable tem@xmath15 mode oriented within the @xmath83 axis ( @xmath87 ) , which we call the _ </S>",

    "<S> it is quite remarkable that , as we show now , all the properties related to spontaneous symmetry breaking can be determined analytically without the need of specifying the steady - state amplitudes @xmath89 . in particular , we are interested in proving that the mode spatially orthogonal to the bright one , that is , the tem@xmath40 mode with the same temporal profile @xmath85 as ( [ classe ] ) but rotated by 90 degrees on the transverse plane ( which we call _ dark mode _ ) , has perfect quadrature squeezing irrespective of the distance to threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the _ horizontal _ and _ vertical _ hermite - gauss annihilation operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 , corresponding to tem@xmath15 ( h ) and tem@xmath40 ( v ) transverse modes respectively , and linearize the quantum langevin equations ( [ langevineqs ] ) with respect to the quantum fluctuations @xmath92 and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the horizontal and vertical subspaces decouple in the linear approximation , and we get for the vertical subspace : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and similarly for the vertical input noises @xmath96 , @xmath97 with @xmath98 the identity matrix with the proper dimensions , and the real , symmetric matrix @xmath99 has elements @xmath100 from the classical steady - state equation , it follows that @xmath101 is an eigenvector of @xmath99 with @xmath58 eigenvalue , and hence , @xmath102 is an eigenvector of the full matrix @xmath103 with @xmath104 eigenvalue . on the other hand , </S>",

    "<S> * discussion*. we have shown that type i spopos pumped by mode - locked laser of gaussian transverse profile , but tuned at the subharmonic frequencies to the first transverse mode family , are the perfect platform where studying the consequences that spontaneous symmetry breaking has on the quantum state of nonlinear optical cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such device will emit a ( classical ) frequency comb with the transverse profile of a tem@xmath15 mode ( bright mode ) , and a perfectly squeezed mode with the same spectral profile but an orthogonal tem@xmath40 spatial profile ( dark mode ) . as shown in previous works @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> such perfect squeezing must be facilitated by the complete quantum indeterminacy of the bright and dark modes orientation @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , within the familiar picture of quantum langevin equations in which operators evolve , keeping track of the quantum dynamics of such a phase is highly non trivial ( since the corresponding operator is quite intricate @xcite ) , and a consistent linearization procedure including the phase dynamics has to be performed within a stochastic representation . </S>",
    "<S> we develop explicitly such a technical approach in the supplemental material , where we obtain a variance of @xmath16 given by @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the modes orientation diffuses with time , but at a slower rate the further we are from threshold ( as @xmath116 gets larger ) . in previous works we proved that a fixed local oscillator which does not follow the rotation of the dark mode is therefore still capable of measuring high levels of squeezing @xcite , and , furthermore , either the injection of a weak seed with the spatiotemporal shape of the bright mode or a small anisotropy in the system are able to fix the orientation of the latter without degrading too much the squeezing of the dark mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these properties extend naturally to our proposed spopo configuration , which will then allow access to this elusive and rich regime of operation where spontaneous symmetry breaking dominates the quantum properties of the output light .    </S>",
