    "starburst phases in galaxies dump a huge amount of mechanical and thermal energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their hosts via stellar winds and supernovae ( sne ; see , e.g. , the models of * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanical energy which is deposited creates shocks in the ambient medium : a forward shock ionises the ism to temperatures of @xmath11k and is visible as diffuse emission in h@xmath10  and other optical spectral lines .",
    "a reverse shock thermalises the stellar ejecta to temperatures of @xmath12k which gives rise to x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this coronal gas is characterised by high pressures which are capable of pushing material to the halo .",
    "if the gravitational potential is shallow and the cooler gas in the halo is not very extended , the material is able to ultimately overcome the host s gravitational potential and the hydrodynamical drag of the surrounding gas .",
    "eventually , the hot gas escapes into the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "to first order , the end products of massive star formation ( sf ) are oblivious to their environment and release the same amount of energy whether sf has taken place in a spiral or in a dwarf galaxy .",
    "dwarf galaxies , however , have a much shallower gravitational potential and outflows can be established more easily .",
    "as metals are produced in high mass stars , the hot gas carries freshly produced heavy elements with it and distributes them over the entire galaxy and/or the igm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the energy input is mainly provided by type ii sne , which predominantly release @xmath10 elements .",
    "iron is efficiently produced in type ia sne but they occur with a substantial time delay ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , the @xmath13 ratio in the outflow is predicted to be higher than solar .",
    "this picture has three important implications .",
    "first of all , it could explain why dwarf galaxies have a much lower metallicity ( @xmath14 solar , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as compared to larger spirals ( @xmath15 solar ) .",
    "secondly , if a starburst is strong enough , it can blow away _ all _ of its ism . in that case",
    ", the galaxy is not able to further form stars and eventually fades .",
    "thirdly , the gas which is expelled to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) pollutes it with heavy elements .",
    "this might have been especially important at large look - back times . in",
    "cold dark matter cosmologies spiral galaxies form by mergers of smaller constituents .",
    "dwarf galaxies formed relatively early and may have quickly polluted the igm by galactic superwinds before larger systems got assembled . due to the larger number of small systems and a higher merging rate which triggers sf ,",
    "the removal of metal - enriched gas in dwarf galaxies by the energetic input of sne and stellar winds may have been more common in the past and may have influenced the formation and evolution of galaxies in general .",
    "this prompted us to embark on a detailed study with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( cxo ) of a sample of eight dwarf galaxies that are undergoing a starburst .",
    "the aim of our study is to try to trace the hot gas in these systems , determine its extent , measure the relative abundance of @xmath10 elements over iron , and assess the likelihood that this hot gas will escape the galaxy . in @xcite",
    "( hereafter referred to as paperi ) we presented the sample a detailed description of our data reduction techniques .",
    "we detected 55 unresolved sources which are likely related to the galaxies and we presented fits to their individual spectra .",
    "six of the dwarf galaxies have diffuse x - ray emission and we derived such fundamental parameters as their x - ray luminosity and the temperature of the gas .",
    "this paper is dedicated to a comparison of the x - ray characteristics of the dwarf galaxies in our sample and of any correlations of their x - ray with other properties . in sect.[sec : sample_props_other ] we summarise the general properties of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "this is followed in sect.[sec : morph ] by a discussion of the morphologies of the different components ( x - ray , optical , h@xmath10 , and hi ) . in sect.[sec : point_pop ] the point source population in the galaxies is discussed according to their locations in the galaxies , their spectral properties and their correlations with sf tracers . in this section",
    "we also present our interpretation of the point source luminosity function .",
    "the x - ray properties of the diffuse , coronal gas are evaluated and compared in sect.[sec : xrayprop ] .",
    "correlations of those properties with quantities derived at other wavelengths are presented in sect.[sec : correl ] followed by a discussion on the probability of outflows in sect.[sec : out ] .",
    "sect.[sec : summary ] summarises our results .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : params_fit_diffuse ]        the @xmath16-band luminosities of the galaxies ( table[tab : sample_derived ] ) may be used as a tracer for their total mass as it is dominated by low - mass and/or old stellar populations . in fig.[fig : correl_lk ] we plot the x - ray luminosity , the thermal energy , and the density of the hot gas as a function of this parameter .",
    "some tentative trends are visible in the sense that the x - ray luminosities and the thermal energies are larger for more massive objects . also the density of the hot gas appears to be somewhat larger with increased @xmath16-band luminosities .",
    "the parameters of the hot gas certainly depend on their ambient , gaseous medium . to check this ,",
    "we plot the x - ray luminosities , the densities , and the pressures of the hot gas as a function of the hi  masses in fig.[fig : correl_hi ] . here",
    ", the density again appears to be a function of the hi  mass , i.e. , a large hi  mass is correlated with a higher density of the hot gas .",
    "as the temperatures of the hot gas are relatively uniform over the sample , this trend is also visible when plotting the pressures versus hi  masses .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , however , seems not to be related to this parameter .",
    "we will now discuss the question whether the energetic input of sf in the galaxies may have resulted in gas removal or not .",
    "theoretical models in the literature try to describe the conditions for this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the escape velocity of the galaxy is a crucial parameter and has to be exceeded by any superwind in order to remove gas from the gravitational well .",
    "the escape velocity depends on the mass of the system .",
    "it is very difficult , however , to make an accurate estimate of the total dark matter content . especially for our sample , where at least three galaxies are interacting with one or more companion galaxies ( izw18 , ngc3077",
    ", ngc4449 ) it is virtually impossible to derive a reliable rotation curve from hi  measurements and therefore to correctly estimate the shape and depth of the gravitational potential .",
    "these galaxies are characterised by close , large tidal tails visible in hi  ( see sect.[sec : morph ] ) .",
    "in addition , the loss of ism can only take place if the hot gas moves supersonically when reaching the scale length of the cooler , surrounding ism @xcite .",
    "if so , the hot gas will be re - accelerated and can not be retained by its host . if this is not the case , the gas will cool down in the galaxy s halo and eventually rain back on its disc .        for the highly disturbed galaxies",
    ", one would need to elaborate detailed hydrodynamical simulations for a correct description of the fate of the superwinds .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we discuss the probabilities for escape in the light of the model described by @xcite ( with galaxy dynamics based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they derive the threshold for the energy input of the starburst required to overcome the gravitational potential based on the ism mass and the pressure of the surrounding igm ( with a scaling law for dark matter of : @xmath17 ) .",
    "if those thresholds are exceeded , the gas is ultimately lost to the igm .",
    "their results are shown in fig.[fig : silich ] . using their thresholds ,",
    "the graph is split into an area where the galaxies do not suffer mass loss and an area where mass can escape to the igm .",
    "the plotted thresholds correspond to a galaxy without rotation and is therefore an upper limit for the injected mechanical luminosity to guarantee retention of the gas ; when rotation is introduced to their models , the thresholds are lowered .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[fig : silich ] was computed for an igm pressure of @xmath18k@xmath4 and the solid line for @xmath19k@xmath4 .",
    "we plotted the galaxies in our sample in this figure .",
    "the mechanical luminosities in fig.[fig : silich](a ) are based on h@xmath10  long slit spectroscopy of @xcite ( izw18 , ngc1569 , ngc3077 , ngc4214 , ngc4449 , ngc5253 ) , @xcite ( he2 - 10 ) , and @xcite ( viizw403 ) .",
    "the mechanical luminosities derived by @xcite depend linearly on the ambient density of the gas . in omw03",
    ", densities were derived for individual superbubbles in the case of ngc3077 and the total mechanical luminosity shown here is corrected accordingly . for the rest of the sample we use a mean density of 0.1@xmath4 .",
    "note however , that the densities of the ambient gas can be an order of magnitude higher ( as in the case ngc3077 , see omw03 ) , and we plot the corresponding luminosities as lower limits in fig.[fig : silich](a ) .",
    "the ism mass for all galaxies is based on the hi  masses taken from table[tab : sample_derived ] and are corrected for the contribution of helium by a multiplication of 1.3 . as it is difficult to correct for the amount of molecular gas , we do not account for it ; if the molecular medium would be as massive as the atomic phase ( an extreme scenario ) the location of the points on the logarithmic scale used in fig.[fig : silich ] would shift by 0.3 to the right .",
    "in addition to the mechanical luminosities derived by h@xmath10spectroscopy , we estimate mechanical luminosities from our x - ray observations in a different , independent manner .",
    "the timescale for mass injection was taken as the scale length of the hot gas divided by the mean velocity per particle ( see tables[tab : profiles_fit ] and [ tab : common_gasparams ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the thermal energies were divided by the resulting timescales .",
    "the luminosities thus obtained are plotted as a function of ism mass in fig.[fig : silich](b ) .    finally , we estimate the mechanical luminosities liberated by the starbursts on the basis of the starburst99 models ( * ? ?",
    "? * their fig.112 , see sect.[sec : massload ] for the parameters of the starburst which we adopt here ) .",
    "scaling these models by the sfrs given in table[tab : sample_derived ] and using the asymptotic solution of the starburst99 model ( note that the mechanical luminosity stays approximately constant for starburst ages larger than the timescale needed for the first sn to explode ) , we derive the mechanical luminosities displayed in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig.[fig : silich ] .",
    "the data in fig.[fig : silich](c ) is based on the sfrs derived on the basis of h@xmath10  measurements ( @xmath20 ) and the data in fig.[fig : silich](d ) are derived for the sfrs converted from the fir luminosities of the galaxies ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "judging from the mechanical luminosities derived on the basis of h@xmath10spectroscopy ( fig.[fig : silich][a ] ) , gas loss is predicted for viizw403 , ngc3077 , ngc1569 , and ngc4449 .",
    "he2 - 10 , izw18 , ngc4214 , and ngc5253 are not necessarily losing material to the halo given their energetics .",
    "those galaxies can exceed the theoretical thresholds , however , if they rotate fast enough , the ambient densities are higher than the adopted 0.1@xmath4  ( increasing the mechanical luminosities ) , or the pressure of the igm is relatively low . according to the mechanical luminosities estimated from the diffuse x - ray emission ( fig.[fig : silich][b ] ) , the starbursts in all galaxies exhibit a sufficient energy deposition rate to push the hot gas away from the galaxies independent of their rotational velocities .",
    "the results based on the starburst99 models yield a very similar picture , and only the superwinds in ngc4214 ( and maybe viizw403 ) might be too weak to force gas loss if their rotation is not significant .",
    "fig.[fig : silich ] therefore strongly suggests that the energy provided by the starburst is sufficient for these galaxies to develop a superwind , leading to a partial loss of the ism .",
    "the observed overpressures of the hot gas as compared to the surroundings support this scenario ( sect.[sec : pressures ] ) .    as a caveat ,",
    "however , the ism must not be very extended for gas loss to occur ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as seen in fig.[fig",
    ": hi_olays ] , ngc3077 and ngc4449 are surrounded by large tidal tails .",
    "the same is true for izw18 ( see the hi  map of * ? ? ?",
    "inspection of the hi  and x - ray morphologies reveals that the diffuse x - ray emission of ngc3077 is more extended toward the north than toward the south following the largest hi  density gradient . toward the south of ngc3077",
    ", the hi  column density stays constant at a level of @xmath22@xmath23 ( see omw03 ) .",
    "once the hot gas reaches the scale length of the hi  while maintaining supersonic speed , it will ultimately be lost . as discussed in omw03",
    "this is likely to happen toward the north of ngc3077 .",
    "gas streaming to the south , however , will likely cool down before reaching the low density igm beyond the large hi  tidal tail ( see also fig.[fig : hi_olays ] ) unless sf continues at a high level on timescales exceeding the cooling time .",
    "the case of ngc4449 is somewhat different .",
    "its hi  is distributed in a ring ( mean hi  column density : @xmath24@xmath23 ) tightly surrounding the optical counterpart with tidal tails connected to the ring stretching outward ( see figs.[fig : n4449_hi ] and [ fig : hi_olays ] ) .",
    "currently , the hot gas streams into the interior of the ring which is the region of lowest hi  column density . depending on how much material can accumulate in this region before the hot gas cools down , the superwind may break through this wall. even if the hot gas extends further out , it still has to provide the work needed to push the gas aside which is stored in the tidal tails .",
    "an escape along the line - of - sight is possibly not a solution as even within the ring low density hi  emission is being observed over a large velocity range ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "no current interaction or apparent tidal tails are observed for ngc4214 . even though the hot gas is concentrated in the central region ( see fig.[fig : hi_olays ] ) , it is very likely that the hot gas escapes along the line - of - sight which corresponds more or less to the z  axis of this object ( note the relatively face - on appearance of ngc4214 ) .",
    "in summary , dwarf galaxies have the potential to release metals to the igm in the form of powerful galactic superwinds .",
    "this is corroborated by their large mechanical energy inputs in a relatively shallow gravitational potential as well as by the overpressures of the hot gas .",
    "the main trigger for starbursts , however , is galaxy - galaxy interactions which produces extended tidal tails , and any low density neutral envelope may provide a barrier for outflow to occur , containing the gas for times larger than the cooling time scale and thus preventing the complete loss of ism to the igm .",
    "in paperi we presented a detailed discussion of the individual x - ray properties as observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ of a sample of eight dwarf galaxies which are in a starburst phase , izw18 , viizw403 , ngc1569 , ngc4214 , ngc4214 , ngc4449 , ngc5253 , and he2 - 10 . here",
    "we present an inter - comparison of their x - ray properties as well as comparisons with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows :    * x - ray point sources ( detected within the optical or hi  extent of an individual galaxy ) are mainly observed close to the centres of the galaxies ; only a few of them are found in their outer regions . in general , they are located close to bright hii  regions , the rims of expanding superbubbles , or uv bright young stellar clusters . the type of x - ray emission mechanism model ( power law , thermal plasma , or black body ) of the point sources appears to be unrelated to their location .",
    "* the number of point sources correlates with the star formation rates of the galaxies and , with less significance , with their blue luminosities .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function of the point sources exhibits a very shallow power law index of @xmath25 .",
    "this value is about a factor of @xmath26 lower than that of more massive starbursts and about 6 times lower than that of non - starburst galaxies .",
    "ten ultraluminous x - ray sources ( x - ray luminosities @xmath27erg  s@xmath28 ) are detected in three galaxies ( izw18 , ngc4449 , he2 - 10 ) .",
    "each of these galaxies is part of a current interaction or merger .",
    "* diffuse x - ray emission emerging from the coronal gas in superwinds is detected in six out of eight galaxies .",
    "the non - detection in izw18 and viizw403 can be understood as being a result of their smaller sizes and/or their extremely low metallicities as compared to the other galaxies in the sample .",
    "we can not rule out that any hot gas that might have been there at earlier times has either vented into the halo or has cooled so as to become undetectable . * superwinds traced by the diffuse , coronal gas develop along the steepest declining gradient in the ism as observed in hi .",
    "a higher temperature is observed in the centres of the galaxies as compared to that in their outskirts .",
    "for about half of the sample , the x - ray emission extends well beyond the hi  component whereas in the other half the hot gas appears to be still enclosed in an hi  envelope . on a global scale the azimuthally averaged h@xmath10  and x - ray surface brightness profiles are very similar and are well fitted by exponential functions with scale lengths @xmath29pc ( ngc4449 : @xmath30pc ) .",
    "this may be a consequence as that on global scales photoionisation and shocks of the h@xmath10  features as well as the thermalisation of the x - ray emitting gas are all due to the impact of massive stars on the ism distributed over the discs of the starburst galaxies . on local scales",
    "the x - ray and h@xmath10  emission are either slightly offset or show the morphology of expanding h@xmath10 shells filled with coronal gas .",
    "* volume densities of the hot gas are in the range @xmath3@xmath4 , pressures vary within @xmath31k@xmath4 , thermal energies are @xmath32erg , and masses @xmath7m@xmath8 .",
    "thus , compared to their hi  content , about 1 per cent of the ism is in the form of hot , coronal gas .",
    "the pressures involved are higher than those for the other components of the ism .",
    "this is the most likely force driving the expansion .",
    "mass - loading of a factor of @xmath33 is needed for the galaxies . *",
    "the x - ray luminosities and the cooling times of the hot gas appear to be related to the metallicities of their host galaxies .",
    "low - metallicity objects have longer cooling times",
    ". furthermore , galaxies with the largest mass - loading factors exhibit the shortest cooling times and the highest mass deposition rates . *",
    "correlations are found for the hi  mass of the galaxies with the pressures and densities of the hot gas .",
    "these parameters appear to increase with increasing hi  mass , the hydrodynamics of which appear to control the confinement of the hot gas .",
    "such a correlation is only tentatively visible when plotting the hot gas parameters against the @xmath16-band luminosities ( used as a tracer for total mass of the galaxies ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray luminosities and thermal energies of the hot gas may be used to trace star formation in the galaxies .",
    "a larger sample , however , is needed to strengthen this correlation . * the mechanical energies , as derived from h@xmath10  and x - ray observations , are large enough to overcome the gravitational potential of their hosts . in combination with the fact that the current star formation is still high and that the hot gas shows an overpressure compared to the ambient ism",
    ", we conclude that outflows are likely and that the hot , @xmath10 elements enriched gas component is lost to the igm .",
    "when large scale , low density hi  tidal tails are present , however , the hot gas appears to be confined within those tidal structures .",
    "dwarf galaxies that are undergoing a starburst are important objects to study due to their potential contribution to the metal enrichment of the igm at large look - back times .",
    "the number of dwarf galaxies in the universe may be large enough to move significant amounts of matter ( and thus metals ) to the intergalactic medium .",
    "here we have shown that outflows are possible in a number of nearby dwarf starbursts ; however some fraction of galaxies will retain their hot gas due to the hydrodynamical drag of extended envelopes of cooler material .",
    "deeper observations of a larger sample of dwarf ( starburst ) galaxies will be necessary to determine if and in which proportion these objects contribute to the metal enrichment of the universe .",

    "<S> for the unresolved x - ray sources we find the following : point sources are in general located close to bright hii  regions , rims of superbubbles , or young stellar clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the number of x - ray point sources appears to be a function of the current star formation rate and the blue luminosity of the hosts . </S>",
    "<S> ultraluminous x - ray sources are only found in those dwarf galaxies which are currently interacting . </S>",
    "<S> the power law index of the combined cumulative x - ray point source luminosity function is @xmath0 , shallower than that of more massive starburst galaxies ( @xmath1 ) and of non - starburst galaxies ( @xmath2 ) . for those galaxies showing extended x - ray emission ( 6 out of the 8 galaxies ) , we derive the following : superwinds develop along the steepest gradient of the hi  distribution with volume densities of @xmath3@xmath4 , pressures of @xmath5k@xmath4 , thermal energies of @xmath6erg , and hot gas masses of @xmath7m@xmath8  ( @xmath9 per cent of the hi  masses . on global scales , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the x - ray emission looks remarkably similar to that seen in h@xmath10 ( comparing azimuthal averages ) ; locally however their distribution is clearly distinct in many cases  this can be explained by the different emission mechanisms ( forward vs.  reverse shocks ) . </S>",
    "<S> mass - loading of order 1 to 5 is required to explain the differences between the amount of hot gas and and the modelled mass - loss from massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity of the dwarf galaxies correlates with the diffuse x - ray luminosity and anti - correlates with the cooling time of the hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse x - ray luminosity is also a function of the current star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical luminosities of the developing superwinds are energetic enough to overcome the gravitational potentials of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is supported by the overpressures of the hot gas compared to the ambient ism . extended hi  envelopes such as tidal tails , however , may delay outflows on timescales exceeding those of the cooling time of the hot gas .    </S>",
