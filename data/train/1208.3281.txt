    "over the past several decades , there has been a steady increase in the accuracy with which extragalactic distances and the hubble constant can be measured ( _ e.g. , _ freedman _",
    "et al_. 2001 , hereafter f01 ; riess _ et al_. 2011 ; komatsu _ et al_. 2011 ; and for a review see freedman & madore 2010 ) .",
    "this has resulted from a number of factors : the availability , on the ground and especially in space , of high throughput , high dynamic range optical ccds and infrared arrays ; the multi - wavelength sensitivity of these devices ; making it possible to correct for systematic effects of reddening and metallicity ; and to use a wider range of methods for measuring relative distances beyond the immediate reach of cepheid variables . just over",
    "a decade ago , there was still debate over the value of the hubble constant at a level of a factor of two ; today , there is the promise of measuring the hubble constant to an accuracy better than two percent .    in combination with other constraints ( _ e.g. , _ the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies ) , an independent measurement of h@xmath7 to accuracy of better than a few percent can provide critical constraints on the dark energy equation of state , the spatial curvature of the universe , neutrino physics and general relativity ( see suyu _",
    "et al_. 2012 for a recent discussion ) . in practice",
    ", an accurate value of h@xmath7 provides a means of breaking the degeneracies amongst several cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies yield well - determined values of the products of @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the matter and baryon densities , respectively ) , but not the densities , nor h@xmath7 independently .",
    "there are other degeneracies between h@xmath7 and the equation of state , w@xmath7 , as well as its evolution , w@xmath12 ; between h@xmath7 and the number of relativisitic neutrinos , n@xmath6 and the sum of the masses of neutrinos ; and between h@xmath7 and @xmath13 , the fluctuation of matter on 8 mpc scales ( for recent discussions , see dunkley _ et al_. 2009 ; komatsu _ et al_. 2009 ) .",
    "hence , the motivation for measuring an independent value of h@xmath7 accurate to a few percent has continued to increase .    as described in freedman _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 , hereafter f11 ) , we have begun a new carnegie hubble program ( chp ) , specifically designed to minimize and/or eliminate the remaining known systematics in the measurement of the hubble constant using mid - infrared data from nasa s _ spitzer space telescope_. here we report on a newly derived value of the hubble constant and its uncertainty , based on the first data acquired from this program for cepheids in the milky way and the lmc .",
    "our focus in this paper is primarily the zero point of the cepheid extragalactic distance scale , and a reassessment of the systematic error budget .",
    "as discussed at length in f11 , there are many advantages in acquiring 3.6 @xmath0 m data compared to optical observations .",
    "the effects of reddening are decreased ( _ e.g. _ , a@xmath14 / a(3.6 @xmath0 m ) @xmath15 15 , and a(i ) / a(3.6 @xmath0 m ) @xmath15 8 ; see f11 and references therein ) .",
    "metallicity effects are both theoretically predicted and empirically demonstrated to be smaller .",
    "in addition , the dispersion in the leavitt law is known to be more than a factor of two smaller in the mid - infrared than in the v - band .",
    "the chp is designed to establish the calibration of the cepheid extragalactic distance scale at mid - infrared wavelengths by observing galaxies with known cepheids in the local group and beyond ; undertaking empirical tests for metallicity effects ; providing a mid - infrared calibration of the tully - fisher relation and for the type ia supernova distance scale .",
    "the ultimate goal is a measurement of the hubble constant to @xmath22% ( statistical plus systematic ) uncertainty .      to date , as part of the chp , we have obtained 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath0 m observations for a sample of 37 galactic cepheids ( monson _ et al_. 2012 ) , 10 of which have direct trigonometric parallaxes measured by the _ hst _",
    "fine guidance sensors ( benedict _ et al_. 2007 ) .",
    "twenty - four observations were made at each wavelength for each cepheid .",
    "since the periods of these cepheids are known _ a priori _ , we were able to schedule these 24 _ spitzer _ observations with a roughly constant or uniform spacing over time for each of the stars .",
    "the milky way cepheids range in period from roughly 4 to 36 days ; five of these cepheids have periods greater than six days .",
    "we have also obtained similarly high - quality , uniformly - sampled data for 80 lmc cepheids ( scowcroft  _ et al_. 2011 , 2012 ) , with periods in the range of 6 to 60 days , distributed across the face of the galaxy , and chosen to be relatively uncrowded , based on h - band images from persson _ et al_. ( 2004 ) .",
    "although not originally designed for a cosmic distance scale program , _ spitzer _ ( werner _ et al_. 2004 ) has proven itself to be an excellent combination of telescope and instruments to measure the cepheid distance scale at long wavelengths .",
    "the mid - ir infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio _ et al_. 2004 ) has the dynamic range , sensitivity and the spatial resolution to be able to measure both the brightest of the milky way ( calibrator ) cepheids and ( with the same telescope , instrument and filters ) target and measure cepheids in the lmc , as well as other nearby galaxies .",
    "historically , the overlap in period between the milky way and lmc cepheid calibrators has been small . beyond the lmc ,",
    "extragalactic distance scale measurements are necessarily limited to the brightest and longest - period cepheids ( generally p @xmath16 10 days . )",
    "the galactic _ hst _ parallax sample contains only one truly long - period cepheid , @xmath17  car at p = 35.5  days .",
    "we therefore use the larger cepheid sample in the lmc to define the slope and width of the long - period ( p @xmath18 6 days ) end of the leavitt law . in figure 1",
    ", we show the extinction - corrected leavitt relations for the sample of 80 lmc stars with _ spitzer _ data from scowcroft _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the 10 milky way calibrators with parallax measurements from benedict _ et al_. ( 2007 ) and new _ spitzer _ observations from monson _",
    "et al_. ( 2012 ) are individually labelled .",
    "lmc data for stars with p @xmath1 6 days from meixner _",
    "et al_. ( 2006 ) are also plotted , but not included in the fits .",
    "we note that the slopes of the mid - infrared leavitt relations for both the milky way and the lmc are consistent over the entire period range from 4 to 60 days .",
    "both the slope and dispersion of the galactic sample alone are , to within the measurement uncertainties , in agreement with the lmc cepheid leavitt relation .",
    "an unweighted least - squares fit to the 10 milky way stars from monson _",
    "et al_. ( 2012 ) gives a slope of -3.40 @xmath2 0.11 , which is statistically in agreement with the more robust value ( -3.31 @xmath2 0.05 ) determined from the 80 stars covering the same period range in our lmc sample ( scowcroft et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "table 8 of monson et al .",
    "provides zero - points and slopes for the 10 milky way cepheids at 3.6 @xmath0 m for a number of different weighting schemes , as well as a zero point obtained by fixing and adopting the lmc slope .",
    "the zero points are -5.81 ( unweighted ) , and -5.80 ( for two different weighting schemes ) . for comparison , fixing the slope to be that for the lmc , yields an intercept of -5.80 ( unweighted ) or -5.79 ( weighted ) . in all cases , the computed uncertainty is 0.03 - 0.04 , and the agreement is excellent .    the dispersion in the extinction - corrected leavitt relation for the lmc at 3.6  @xmath0 m amounts to only @xmath20.106 mag , giving an uncertainty of @xmath25% in distance for a single cepheid ; the dispersion for the sample of ten milky way cepheids is @xmath20.104 mag .",
    "correcting for the tilt of the lmc ( _ e.g. _ , scowcroft et al .",
    "2012 ) , the scatter in the 3.6  @xmath0 m leavitt relation reduces from @xmath20.106 to @xmath20.100  mag . with this sample of cepheids observed at these long wavelengths , the random error on the distance modulus to the lmc",
    "has been reduced to @xmath20.100/ @xmath19 = @xmath20.011 mag .",
    "we take the systematic error on the distance modulus to the lmc to be defined by the uncertainty in the milky way best - fit intercept , when both the slope and intercept are fit simultaneously for the 10 milky way cepheids , given by @xmath20.104 / @xmath20 = 0.033 mag .",
    "adopting the ten galactic calibrators these data yield a true distance modulus to the lmc of 18.477 @xmath2 0.011 ( _ statistical _ )",
    "@xmath2 0.033  mag ( _ systematic _ ) .",
    "most recent extragalactic studies have used the distance to the lmc as fiducial .",
    "for example , the methodology of the _ key project _ ( f01 ) was to adopt an lmc true distance modulus of 18.50 @xmath2 0.10  mag , and a reddening to the lmc of e(b - v ) = 0.10 mag .",
    "relative distance moduli of galaxies beyond the lmc were then determined using the reddening - free wesenheit function , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ratio of total to selective absorption .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that given an updated zero point , any offset can simply be applied to the entire _ key project _ distance scale .",
    "we apply our new _",
    "zero - point calibration to the benedict _ et al_. ( 2007 ) milky way parallax stars , and combine it with the _ hst _ _ key project _ data from f01 . we note that the mid - ir _ spitzer_-based distance modulus for the lmc is 0.023  mag ( @xmath151.2% in distance ) smaller than the value of 18.50  mag adopted by f01 as part of the _ key project _",
    ", thus increasing @xmath3 by 1.2% .",
    "in addition , ( as described in ",
    "[ sec : metallicity ] ) , switching from a lmc - based zero point to the milky way calibration , the metallicity correction to the _ key project _",
    "sample is now also significantly reduced ( by 0.04 mag giving an additional 2% increase in @xmath3 ) .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath3 = 74.3 @xmath2 2.1 ( _ systematic _ )  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "this value of the hubble constant is in excellent agreement with that of f01 , as well as more recent determinations by riess _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 ) , and komatsu _ et al_. ( 2011 ) .",
    "we provide a detailed discussion of the systematic uncertainty on this value in the following section .",
    "at the conclusion of the _ key project _ , f01 quantified the outstanding sources of _ systematic _ uncertainty ( their table 14 ) known to be affecting the value of the hubble constant at that time .",
    "these included : the absolute zero point of the leavitt law , which was explicitly tied to the distance to the lmc ( @xmath25% ) ; the uncertainty in the metallicity correction to the leavitt period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , resulting from the systematic offset in mean metallicity between the lmc and many of the more distant ( higher metallicity ) spiral galaxies ( @xmath24% ) ; the cumulative uncertainties resulting from the cross - calibrating of instruments , filters and detectors from the ground to space ( @xmath23.5% ) ; systematic reddening errors ( @xmath21% ) ; bias in fitting the pl relation to truncated data ( @xmath21% ) ; crowding or blending of images based on artificial star tests ( @xmath235% ) ; and finally allowing for bulk flows on large scales ( @xmath25% ) .",
    "the mid - infrared / trigonometric parallax calibration for galactic cepheids immediately solves two outstanding problems .",
    "it provides an accurate ( geometric ) foundation upon which to set the zero point of the leavitt law , at any given wavelength .",
    "in addition , it provides high - metallicity cepheid calibrators that are more comparable to the bulk of high - metallity cepheids in the target galaxies used for the _ hst _ _ key project _ , as well as other determinations of @xmath3 .",
    "below we discuss the two systematic errors for which there is significant quantitative improvement resulting from the new _ spitzer _ data .",
    "we then discuss the status of other terms entering the systematic error budget .      as we saw in ",
    "[ sec : newcal ] , the measured scatter in the milky way leavitt relation of @xmath20.104 mag suggests that the ten galactic calibrators define the zero point to @xmath20.104/@xmath20 = 0.033 mag .",
    "we adopt this value as the systematic error on the zero point of the cepheid pl relation . despite the small sample of galactic calibrators , the systematic error on the zero point of the cepheid leavitt relation",
    "is already reduced to only 1.7@xmath24 in distance ; i.e. , a factor of three better than the quoted uncertainty of the _ hst _ _ key project _ zero point .",
    "this uncertainty is also a measure of the _ systematic error _ on the distance to the lmc .",
    "we have been awarded further _",
    "time to observe a sample of nearby galactic cepheids , so that ultimately gaia can provide accurate parallaxes for a sample size comparable to that of the lmc .",
    "windmark _ et al_. ( 2011 ) have recently discussed the potential of using gaia to determine the cepheid zero point .",
    "although they estimate that approximately 9000 cepheids will be within reach of gaia , the overall accuracy will be limited by systematic effects , primarily reddening . hence obtaining mid - infrared observations for these milky way",
    "cepheids remains critical .",
    "a number of observations and tests are built into the chp _",
    "program ( see f11 ) to quantify the magnitude of any residual metallicity effect .",
    "the first of these tests is discussed in f11 where the deviations of individual 3.6  @xmath0 m lmc cepheid magnitudes from the pl relation , as a function of spectroscopic [ fe / h ] metal abundances ( from romaniello _ et al_. 2008 ) , exhibit only a very shallow ( and statistically insignificant ) slope of -0.09 @xmath2 0.29 mag / dex .",
    "moreover , figure 7 of f11 shows no evidence of any metallicity effect for three galactic cepheids for which there are both 3.6  @xmath0 m data and [ fe / h ] measurements .",
    "as we noted above , in moving to a zero - point calibration of the milky way cepheid pl relation at 3.6  @xmath0 m , the cepheid zero - point calibration can now be directly established at high metallicity , avoiding the intermediate step of calibrating with the ( lower - metallicity ) lmc .",
    "the metallicities ( 12 + log ( o / h ) ) of the lmc , milky way and the mean of the _ key project _ spiral galaxies are 8.50 , 8.70 , and 8.84 dex , respectively ( f01 and references therein ; allende - prieto _",
    "et al_. 2001 ) . for the _ key project _ ,",
    "a slope of the metallicity correction of -0.20 @xmath2 0.2 mag / dex was adopted , where one dex corresponds to a factor of ten in metallicity .",
    "specifically , a correction to the distance modulus of @xmath25 = -0.20 @xmath26 ( [ o / h ] - [ o / h]@xmath27 ) was made .",
    "f01 adopted a metallicity correction of -0.20 @xmath26 0.34 = -0.068 mag , corresponding to a decrease in the hubble constant of 3.5% , and adopted an uncertainty corresponding to the entire correction .",
    "now , correcting back from the lmc to solar metallicity ( 0.20 mag / dex @xmath26 0.20 dex = 0.040 mag ) results in a differential correction to the hubble constant of + 2% . in the past",
    "we conservatively adopted the total magnitude of the correction as being equivalent to its own systematic uncertainty .",
    "the difference between the _ key project _ sample and the milky way now implies a correction of 0.2 mag / dex @xmath26 0.14 dex = 0.028 mag , or 1.4% in the distance scale .    in figure 2",
    "we show updated and revised plots of magnitude and color residuals from the mid - ir pl relations plotted as a function of spectroscopic atmospheric [ fe / h ] metallicities from romaniello _ et al_. ( 2008 ) .",
    "this plot supersedes earlier versions given in freedman & madore ( 2010 ) and freedman _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 ) as it now uses the final magnitudes and pl fits for the entire lmc sample given in scowcroft_et al_. ( 2011 , 2012 ) and extends the milky way sample to significantly higher metallicities using the newly published galactic cepheid mid - ir data of monson _ et al_. ( 2012 ) .",
    "the formal solutions are @xmath28 = + 0.07 ( \\pm0.18)$ ] [ fe / h ] @xmath29 and @xmath30 = + 0.04 ( \\pm0.19 ) [ fe / h ] + 0.04 ( \\pm0.06)$ ] .",
    "these data are consistent with no significant correlation between the metallicity and the 3.6 or 4.5 @xmath0 m cepheid magnitudes over the metallicity range @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath32 .",
    "_ wfpc2 zero point / instrumental systematics : _ as discussed in stetson ( 1998 ) , the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on hst had an imperfect charge transfer efficiency . to quantify the uncertainties , stetson carried out an extensive comparison of wfpc2 and ground - based photometry for milky way globular cluster stars .",
    "he found that the formal standard errors in this comparison were significantly less than 1% , but concluded that the true external uncertainties were more likely at least of order 1% .",
    "a difference of 0.07 @xmath2 0.02 mag was found between the ground - based and wfpc2 photometry , and this correction was applied to the latter in f01 .",
    "we note that in table 14 of f01 , the magnitude of this offset ( 0.07 mag or 3.5% ) rather than the uncertainty ( 0.02 mag or 1% ) was tabulated . in this paper",
    ", we quote the original uncertainty consistent with that determined by stetson ( 1998 ) .    _ reddening : _ from the optical through the infrared ,",
    "the effect of interstellar extinction is a generally declining function of increasing wavelength .",
    "a significant advantage of observing cepheids in the mid - infrared is therefore a reduced sensitivity to extinction ( both galactic and extragalactic ) .",
    "the interstellar extinction law at mid - infrared wavelengths has now been measured by a number of authors ( see f11 and references therein ) .",
    "the shape of the extinction curve shows some variation between different sightlines , with an observed range of @xmath33 = 0.058 to 0.071 at 3.6 @xmath0 m , and 0.023 to 0.060 at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , the extinction measured in magnitudes in the mid - ir , as compared to optical @xmath34-band data , for example , is reduced by factors of 14 - 17 at 3.6 @xmath0 m , and 16 - 43 at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "thus , moving to the mid - ir reduces , by more than an order of magnitude , the sensitivity of the zero point of the cepheid distance scale to reddening corrections .",
    "although uncertainties in reddening may contribute to statistical uncertainties ( at the @xmath11% level ) for individual galaxies , as discussed in f01 ) , they are no longer a significant contributor to the overall systematic error budget .    _",
    "pl fitting bias : _ apparent magnitude cut - offs in the discovery and measurement of cepheids at the detection limits of surveys can , in principle , give rise to biased fitting errors .",
    "this effect is a decreasing function of width ( i.e. , intrinsic dispersion ) of the pl relation , and hence , is again ameliorated by working at mid - infrared wavelengths , or using the reddening - free magnitude , w. by performing successive period cuts , f01 determined that the bias was negligible for the _ key project _ sample , with the mean correction for the sample amounting to 0.01 mag .",
    "a period cut was applied to the shortest period cepheids to correct for this small bias .    _ crowding : _ at present , crowding is not an issue for the milky way cepheids , which are bright and isolated .",
    "it is also not a significant issue for the lmc sample of scowcroft _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 , 2012 ) , where the lmc sample cepheids were pre - selected on the basis of near - infrared images to be isolated . in the case of the more distant",
    "_ _ key project _",
    "sample , a published uncertainty of @xmath10.02 mag ( `` even in the most problematic cases '' ) was given by ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) based on artificial star tests .",
    "we note that f01 adopted an uncertainty of 5% ( 0.10 mag ) due to crowding ; however , no justification was provided for this larger adopted value , and the quantitative basis for this uncertainty relies on the artificial star experiments . in appendix a , we further quantitatively explore the effects of crowding on cepheids by blue main - sequence stars , and find , in agreement with the results of ferrarese _",
    "et al_. , that crowding effects in the mean are less than 1% .",
    "_ large - scale flows : _ early cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of large - scale structure ( _ e.g. , _ turner _ et al_. 1992 ) suggested that sparse sampling of cosmologically small volumes could give rise to biased values of the hubble constant ( at the 2 - 4% level in samples only extending out to 10,000  km s@xmath4 ) . for scales out to 40,000 km s@xmath4 , variations were predicted to be only 1 - 2% . over time , the data constraining the local hubble flow have continued to increase in sample size , depth and precision .",
    "recent analyses of a sample of well - measured type ia supernovae ( hicken _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) sampling volumes with velocities extending to over 20,000  km s@xmath4 suggest that there are no significant systematic departures of the hubble constant from its globally - averaged value ; _ i.e. , _ there is no local void .",
    "this is consistent also with the analysis of sandage _ et al_. ( 2010 ) ; see also turnbull _ et al_. ( 2011 ) and references therein for a recent discussion of bulk flows . at present , we conservatively include a 1-@xmath35 systematic error of 1% for large - scale flows .",
    "we summarize our adopted systematic errors for @xmath3 in table 1 .",
    "the errors are also displayed graphically in figure 3 , and compared with those from the _ hst _ _ key project_. the current dominant source of systematic uncertainty remains the absolute zero point ; however , this uncertainty is a factor of three smaller than for the _ hst _ _ key project _ results of a decade ago . adding the individual contributions in table 1 in quadrature",
    "yields an overall systematic uncertainty of @xmath22.1  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , or an uncertainty of 2.8% for @xmath3 = 74.3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , which we adopt as the result for this paper .",
    "in this section , we compare our results with those of riess _",

    "when incorporating data from type supernovae ( sne ) ia , we use further modifications by alex conley .",
    "we begin by combining our result with the wmap7 cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements ( komatsu _ et al_. 2011 ) .",
    "we assume a flat universe ( @xmath44 and a dark energy equation of state that does not evolve with time ( @xmath45 ) . given these constraints , the resulting best - fit values for the equation of state parameter is @xmath46 . in figure",
    "[ fig : wmap7+bao]a , we show 1- and 2-@xmath35 confidence regions in the @xmath37/@xmath39 plane using both the chp constraint on @xmath37 ( blue curve ) and the constraint from f01 ( red curve ) . by way of comparison , the most recent results combining type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , wmap7 , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) under the same constraints ( @xmath40 and @xmath45 ) give @xmath47 ( amanullah et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "both results are compatible with a simple cosmological constant .",
    "it should be noted that because the predictive power of sne ia is in the measurement of the curvature of the hubble diagram ( and not its zero - point ) , any constraints on dark energy derived from sne ia are insensitive to improvements in the accuracy of @xmath37 .",
    "we next incorporate results from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "unlike sne ia , bao experiments lack a low - redshift measurement and in a combined analysis of this type , the results are therefore constrained by an accurate value of @xmath37 .",
    "keeping the same constraints as before ( @xmath40 and @xmath45 ) and adding in the data from reid et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we find @xmath48 . we also find that the posterior distribution of @xmath37 has been shifted down to @xmath49  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "the earlier , broader prior from f01 would bring the value of @xmath37 down even lower to @xmath50  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( see figure [ fig : wmap7+bao]b ) , resulting in a difference between the value of @xmath37 from cmb+bao alone and that derived from the chp .",
    "pushing the data a little further , we can remove the constraint for a flat universe .",
    "again , keeping @xmath45 and combining wmap7 and bao , the constraints on @xmath39 are reduced considerably , resulting in a best - fit value of @xmath51 , which is inconsistent with a cosmological constant at about 1.5-@xmath35 . the discrepancy between the prior and posterior values of @xmath37",
    "is reduced somewhat , owing to the increased degrees of freedom in this model .",
    "the resulting constraint on the curvature parameter is @xmath52 , favoring a flat universe at almost 2-@xmath35 .",
    "we also explore increasing the effective number of relativistic particles or number of neutrino species , ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we do not consider limits on neutrino masses here . there is a long literature on the subject of constraints on neutrino physics ( masses and numbers of particles ) from cosmology ( see ma & bertschinger 1995 ; dolgov 2002 ; lesgourgues and pastor 2006 ) . during the radiation era , neutrinos",
    "play a significant role in the cosmological expansion .",
    "neutrinos also affect the growth of structure , and alter the amplitudes of the peaks in the cosmic microwave background spectrum , both suppressing and shifting the positions of the acoustic cmb peaks .",
    "the effective number of neutrino species in the standard model of particle physics is n@xmath54 = 3.046 .",
    "the presence of extra relativistic particle species can lead to measureable effects in the cmb spectrum ( _ e.g. _ , dunkley _",
    "et al_. 2009 ; komatsu _ et al_. 2009 ; 2011 ) .    assuming the extra relativistic particles are massless neutrinos , their density can be related to the density of photons through @xmath55 ( komatsu _ et al_. 2009 ) .",
    "this then modifies the evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath56 , by replacing the standard photon density parameter with @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig : neff ] illustrates the constraints on the number of neutrino species , adopting the komatsu _",
    "et al_. ( 2009 ) model and combining the chp h@xmath7 value with wmap7 and bao data . to begin , we assume a flat universe .",
    "we find @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the agreement in the value of @xmath37 is improved , but now the equation of state parameter shifts to a higher value : @xmath59 .",
    "if we further restrict the model to a pure cosmological constant ( @xmath60 ) , the constraints tighten to @xmath61 , differing by 2-@xmath35 from the standard value .    in order to investigate the case where both @xmath62 and @xmath53 are free to vary",
    ", we need to incorporate an additional independent dataset .",
    "we use the sn ia data from sullivan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , consisting of the the snls 3-year sample , the sdssii sn sample , the high - z sample from riess et al . , ( 2007 ) , and several low - redshift samples from the literature .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , supernovae have the advantage that they can be observed at low redshift and therefore do not require @xmath37 to constrain @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , current observations of supernovae extend only to redshift @xmath63 and therefore do not probe the epoch when radiation was more important . with this increased dataset , we now relax both restrictions on @xmath62 and @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig : wmap+bao+snls ] shows the combined results of wmap7 , sn ia , and bao .",
    "once again , the red contours show the earlier constraints from f01 and the blue contours show the constraints using the chp results .",
    "the chp data do not improve the constraints on @xmath39 in this scenario , yet they still improve the constraints on the number of neutrinos : @xmath64 . a summary of these cosmological constraints are included in table 2 .",
    "these mcmc calculations , incorporating our chp h@xmath7 prior and combining with the wmap7 data strongly favor a universe with w@xmath7 @xmath15 -1 .",
    "adding in additional data from bao and sne ia , they are consistent at the 2-@xmath35 level with an additional neutrino species .",
    "other recent studies have obtained results very similar to those obtained here ( _",
    "e.g_. , dunkley _",
    "et al _ 2010 .",
    "; reid _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ; riess _ et al_. 2011 ; komatsu _ et al_. 2011 ; mehta _ et al_. 2012 ) .",
    "given the number of degrees of freedom , and real degeneracies that exist amongst the parameters , caution should be exercised in interpreting 2-@xmath35 results .",
    "future data ( _ e.g. , _ from planck ) should settle the question of the number of neutrino species definitively .",
    "as we saw in figure 3 , we have graphically summarized the decrease in each of the systematic uncertainties , comparing the _ hst _ _ key project _ and the chp .",
    "there are four key systematic improvements to the cepheid distance scale that have occurred in the decade separating this study and the _ hst _ _ key project .",
    "_    first , the _ spitzer _",
    "3.6  @xmath0 m data provide a zero point that is about an order of magnitude less sensitive to total line - of - sight extinction than the optical bands used for the _",
    "key project_. systematic uncertainties in the reddening corrections ( and uncertainties in the extinction law itself ) are virtually eliminated in moving to the mid - ir .",
    "second , longer - wavelength data are theoretically predicted ( _ e.g. , _ marconi _ et al_. 2005 ; romaniello _ et al_. 2008 ) and empirically demonstrated ( freedman & madore 2010 ; freedman _ et al_. 2011 ; riess _",
    "et al_. 2011 ; this paper ) to be less sensitive to metallicity . moreover , the milky way cepheid sample ( now setting the zero point ) has a metallicity more comparable to those of the majority of the _ hst _ _ key project _ spiral galaxies , thereby eliminating the bulk of the systematic uncertainty involved in previously using the ( lower - metallicity ) lmc cepheids for the zero - point calibration .",
    "third , there are now direct parallax measurements for a representative sample of milky way cepheids to define geometrically the absolute zero point of the leavitt relation ( benedict _ et al_. 2007 ) .",
    "this new _ spitzer _ galactic trigonometric zero point eliminates the long - standing dependence on the distance to the lmc .",
    "long - period lmc cepheids simply define the slope and width of the 3.6  @xmath0 m leavitt law .",
    "in addition , independent geometric methods for measuring the distance to the lmc agree with the cepheid calibration to within 1.5% @xmath65 in distance , providing an external check on this new calibration .",
    "fourth , and independently of the chp , new near - infrared cepheid distances to galaxies containing type ia supernovae ( riess _ et al_. 2011 ) , as well as larger samples of more distant supernovae ( hicken _ et al_. 2009 ) have become available .    based on our analysis of the _ spitzer _ data available to date , combined with data from the hubble _ key project _ , we find @xmath3 = 74.3 @xmath2 0.4 ( statistical ) @xmath2 2.1 ( systematic ) km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is in excellent agreement with that of the _ key project _ , as well as that of riess _",
    "et al_. ( 2011 ) . combining this result with constraints from wmap7 alone",
    "yields a value for the dark energy equation of state of @xmath5 = -1.09 @xmath2 0.10 . further combining bao and sne ia data , and relaxing the restriction on the numbers of neutrino species results in a model with @xmath5 = -1.08 @xmath2 0.10 and @xmath53 = 4.13 @xmath2 0.67 .",
    "these data are compatible with , but do not require the presence of an additional neutrino species .",
    "the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in our new value of @xmath3 is the zero - point uncertainty in the cepheid period - luminosity relation , currently limited by the small numbers of long - period cepheids having trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "nevertheless , this uncertainty is now more than a factor of three smaller than the zero - point uncertainty for the _ key project_.    as outlined in f11 , as part of the chp we have also already observed cepheids at 3.6  @xmath0 m in a sample of nearby local group galaxies and beyond ; we are undertaking several metallicity tests of the leavitt relation at 3.6  @xmath0 m ; we are measuring a cepheid distance to the maser galaxy , ngc 4258 at 3.6  @xmath0 m ; and we are calibrating the tully - fisher relation at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "future improvements in the cepheid zero point will come with the launch of gaia , and an increased sample of milky way cepheids and rr lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes , which are needed to better define the zero point of the leavitt relation . having a value of @xmath3 with an",
    "externally well - tested and robust total error budget of less than 2% appears feasible within the next decade .",

    "we present here a quantitative discussion of the effects of crowding on the errors in magnitudes and colors of cepheids as used to determine distance in the _ hst _ _ key project _ ( freedman _ et al_. 2001 ) .",
    "the key project galaxy fields are dominated by a blue plume of high - mass , high - luminosity o and b supergiants , which are the longer - lived progenitors of the cepheid variables .",
    "the blue plume stars are therefore the most likely objects to be crowding the cepheids and contaminating their photometry .",
    "figure a1 illustrates the effects of the contamination of a cepheid by blue main sequence stars .",
    "the uncontaminated cepheid is given a fiducial magnitude of v = 0.0  mag and a typical cepheid color of ( v - i ) = 1.00  mag .",
    "a sequence of progressively brighter main sequence stars , each having ( v - i ) = 0.2  mag , was then sequentially added to the light of the cepheid . the combined light of the two is plotted as circled dots progressively making the contaminated cepheid appear brighter and bluer . the contaminated cepheid appears fainter and redder if an uncorrected statistical excess of blue - plume light was contained in the sky aperture .",
    "`` fainter and redder '' has the same sense of direction in the color - magnitude diagram as extinction / reddening . for the _ key project _",
    ", reddening was accounted for by producing a wesenheit reddening - free magnitude @xmath66 v - r@xmath26(v - i ) , where r is the ratio of total - to - selective absorption such that r = a@xmath14/e(v - i ) , where a@xmath14 is the extinction and e(v - i ) is the reddening , and r in this case has the independently determined value of 2.45 .",
    "a line of constant @xmath67 passing through our sample cepheid is shown as the solid line crossing the color - magnitude diagram diagonally from upper left to lower right .",
    "this line also closely tracks the contamination trajectory defined by the circled dots .",
    "quantitatively , for contaminating stars up to 1.8 mag brighter than the cepheids , the contaminated cepheids are only at most 0.06  mag in v away from the line of constant @xmath67 .",
    "in fact the average difference in @xmath67 is only 0.03  mag over the range where the v magnitude increases by a full magnitude due to contamination . at low levels of contamination",
    "this effect is smaller by a factor of four . for the illustrative purposes here",
    ", we have not modeled the luminosity function of the blue plume stars .",
    "we note , however , that the slope of the luminosity function is such that contamination by brighter stars is statistically less likely than for fainter stars .",
    "these results are quantitatively consistent with the artificial star experiments of ferrarese _ et al_. ( 2000 ) , who concluded that the effects of crowding in the _ key project _ fields were less than 0.02 mag or 1% in distance .",
