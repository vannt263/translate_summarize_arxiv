    "cellular automata ( cas ) are discrete dynamical systems that have been studied theoretically for years due to their architectural simplicity and the wide spectrum of behaviors they are capable of @xcite .",
    "cas are capable of universal computation and their time evolution can be complex .",
    "but many cas show simpler dynamical behaviors such as fixed points and cyclic attractors . here",
    "we study cas that can be said to perform a simple `` computational '' task .",
    "one such tasks is the so - called _ majority _ or _ density _",
    "task in which a two - state ca is to decide whether the initial state contains more zeros than ones or _",
    "vice versa_. in spite of the apparent simplicity of the task , it is difficult for a local system as a ca as it requires a coordination among the cells . as such , it is a perfect paradigm of the phenomenon of _ emergence _ in complex systems .",
    "that is , the task solution is an emergent global property of a system of locally interacting agents .",
    "indeed , it has been proved that no ca can perform the task perfectly i.e. , for any possible initial binary configuration of states @xcite .",
    "however , several efficient cas for the density task have been found either by hand or by using heuristic methods , especially evolutionary computation @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the work done on the problem in the last ten years see @xcite .",
    "all previous investigations have empirically shown that finding good cas for the majority task is very hard .",
    "in other words , the space of automata that are feasible solutions to the task is a difficult one to search .",
    "however , there have been no investigations , to our knowledge , of the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one . in this paper",
    "we try to statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of searching the majority ca landscape .",
    "our investigation is a study of the fitness landscape as such , and thus it is ideally independent from the actual heuristics used to search the space provided that they use independent bit mutation as a search operator .",
    "however , a second goal of this study is to understand the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should possess .",
    "+ the present study follows in the line of previous work by hordijk @xcite for another interesting collective ca problem : the synchronization task @xcite .    the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "the next section summarizes definitions and facts about cas and the density task , including previous results obtained in building cas for the task .",
    "a description of fitness landscapes and their statistical analysis follows .",
    "this is followed by a detailed analysis of the majority problem fitness landscape .",
    "next we identify and analyze a particular subspace of the problem search space called the olympus .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and hints to further works and open questions .",
    "cas are dynamical systems in which space and time are discrete .",
    "a standard ca consists of an array of cells , each of which can be in one of a finite number of possible states , updated synchronously in discrete time steps , according to a local , identical transition rule . here",
    "we will only consider boolean automata for which the cellular state @xmath0 .",
    "the regular cellular array ( grid ) is @xmath1-dimensional , where @xmath2 is used in practice . for one - dimensional grids ,",
    "a cell is connected to @xmath3 local neighbors ( cells ) on either side where @xmath3 is referred to as the _ radius _ ( thus , each cell has @xmath4 neighbors , including itself ) .",
    "transition rule _ contained in each cell is specified in the form of a rule table , with an entry for every possible neighborhood configuration of states .",
    "the state of a cell at the next time step is determined by the current states of a surrounding neighborhood of cells .",
    "thus , for a linear ca of radius @xmath3 with @xmath5 , the update rule can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the state of site @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 represents the local transition rule , and @xmath3 is the ca radius . +",
    "the term _ configuration _ refers to an assignment of ones and zeros to all the cells at a given time step .",
    "it can be described by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice size .",
    "the cas used here are linear with periodic boundary conditions @xmath13 i.e. , they are topologically rings . + a global update rule @xmath14 can be defined which applies in parallel to all the cells : @xmath15 the global map @xmath14 thus defines the time evolution of the whole ca .",
    "+ to visualize the behavior of a ca one can use a two - dimensional space - time diagram , where the horizontal axis depicts the configuration @xmath16 at a certain time @xmath9 and the vertical axis depicts successive time steps , with time increasing down the page ( for example , see figure  [ sync - ca ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     all gas have _ on average _ better performances than the optima find by human or by genetic programming .",
    "as expected , searching in the olympus is useful to find good rules .",
    "all the gas have nearly the same average performances . however , standard deviation of olympus is four times larger than standard deviation of centroid. as it is confirmed by the mean distance between individuals , the cga quickly looses diversity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ga ] ) . on the other hand , neutral ga",
    "keep genetic diversity during runs .",
    "figure [ fig - threshold ] shows that for the most interesting threshold over @xmath17 , neutral have more runs able to overcome the threshold ( @xmath18 ) than olympus ( @xmath19 ) or centroid ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "even though we can not statistically compare the best performance of different gas , the best rule was found by the nga with performance of @xmath21 to be compared to the second best rule @xmath22 .",
    "these experimental results using gas confirm that it is easy to find good rules in the olympus landscape . during all the @xmath23 independent runs , we find a lot of different cas with performance over @xmath24 : @xmath25 for oga , @xmath26 for cga and @xmath27 for nga .",
    "a low computational effort is needed to obtain such cas .",
    "a run takes about 8 hours on pc at 2 ghz . taking the neutrality into account allows to maintain the diversity of the population and increases the chance to reach rules with high performance .",
    "cellular automata are capable of universal computation and their time evolution can be complex and unpredictable .",
    "we have studied cas that perform the computational majority task .",
    "this task is a good example of the phenomenon of emergence in complex systems is . in this paper",
    "we have taken an interest in the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one .",
    "the first goal was to study the landscape as such , and thus it is ideally independent from the actual heuristics used to search the space .",
    "however , a second goal was to understand the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should possess .",
    "we have statistically quantified in various ways some features of the landscape and the degree of difficulty of optimizing .",
    "the neutrality of the landscape is high , and the neutral network topology is not completely random .",
    "the main observation was that the landscape has a considerable number of points with fitness @xmath28 or @xmath29 which means that investigations based on sampling techniques on the whole landscape are unlikely to give good results .",
    "in the second part we have studied the landscape _ from the top_. although it has been proved that no ca can perform the task perfectly , six efficient cas for the majority task have been found either by hand or by using heuristic methods , especially evolutionary computation . exploiting similarities between these cas and symmetries in the landscape , we have defined the _ olympus _ landscape as a subspace of the majority problem landscape which is regarded as the `` heavenly home '' of the six _ symmetric of best local optima known _",
    "( _ blok@xmath30 _ ) .",
    "then , we have measured several properties of the olympus landscape and we have compare with those of the full landscape , finding that there are less solutions with fitness @xmath28 .",
    "fdc shows that fitness is a reliable guide to drive a searcher toward the _ blok@xmath30 _ and its centroid .",
    "an @xmath31 model has been used to describe the fitness / fitness correlation structure .",
    "the model indicates that local search heuristics are adequate for finding good rules .",
    "fitness clouds and nsc confirm that it is easy to reach solutions with fitness higher than @xmath29 .",
    "although it is easier to find relevant cas in this subspace than in the complete landscape , there are structural reasons that prevents a searcher from finding overfitted gas in the olympus .",
    "finally , we have studied the dynamics and performances of three genetic algorithms on the olympus in order to confirm our analysis and to find efficient cas for the majority problem with low computational effort .    beyond this particular optimization problem ,",
    "the method presented in this paper could be generalized . indeed , in many optimization problems , several efficient solutions are available , and we can make good use of this set to design an `` olympus subspace '' in the hope of finding better solutions or finding good solutions more quickly .",
