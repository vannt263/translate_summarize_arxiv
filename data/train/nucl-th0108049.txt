    "it has been suggested that the pion form factor and/or the @xmath1 vertex could be modified by the nuclear medium .",
    "one possible way to investigate this interesting question is to study the electroproduction of charged pions on the nuclei in the kinematic region where the outgoing pions are in the direction of the exchanged virtual photon .",
    "for this so - called parallel kinematics , the pion pole term ( i.e the pion - exchange production amplitude of fig.[fig2]a ) is expected to be dominant and hence the measured cross sections could be used to explore the medium effects on the pion form factor and/or the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "the above consideration has motivated an experiment at saclay in 1990 @xcite and another @xcite at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to address some theoretical questions concerning the interpretation of the data from these experimental efforts . here , we consider the simplest @xmath0 reaction .",
    "we use the dynamical model developed by sato and lee @xcite ( called the sl model ) .",
    "the aim of the sl model is to interpret the data of pion photoproduction and electroproduction in terms of quark sub - structure of hadrons .",
    "the outcome of this effort has two aspects : ( i ) to establish the interpretation of the @xmath4 excitation in terms of constituent quark models .",
    "( ii ) to have a dynamical model which gives a fairly accurate description of all of the data of pion photoproduction and electroproduction , which can be used to perform various nuclear calculations .",
    "we make use of the second aspect of the sl model in this investigation .    the sl model is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of a production term , illustrated in fig.2 , and a term involving @xmath5 scattering .",
    "the focus of the experiments with parallel kinematics is the pion pole term , fig.[fig2]a , which depends on the pion form factor and the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "clearly , the effects due to the other terms in figs.[fig1]-[fig2 ] must be carefully investigated before the medium effects on the pion pole term can be determined .",
    "this will be the ultimate goal of this work .",
    "the second problem we want to address is the extent to which the effect due to the pion pole term will be masked by the hadronic final state interactions . for the @xmath0 reaction , the final @xmath1 interactions can in principle be calculated by using the unitary formulation developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "this is a rather complex numerical task and will not be pursued in this work .",
    "instead we consider only the leading terms of a multiple scattering expansion of the scattering amplitude defined by the @xmath1 model of ref.@xcite .",
    "we thus calculate the @xmath0 cross sections from the four leading mechanisms illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the impulse term(@xmath6 ) , illustrated in fig.[fig3]a , is due to the production on a nucleon in the deuteron .",
    "the other three terms are due to final two - nucleon interactions , pion rescattering from the second nucleon ( @xmath1 ) , and intermediate @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions .",
    "the amplitudes of these reaction mechanisms can be evaluated straightforwardly from using the sl model and the @xmath1 model developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "thus our calculations of the @xmath0 cross sections will be free of adjustable parameters .    in section",
    "ii , we present the formulation for calculating the cross sections of @xmath7 reaction . the results are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "in the rest frame of the initial deuteron , the differential cross section of the @xmath7 reaction can the be calculated from @xmath8\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\gamma _ { v } \\left [ \\sigma _ { t}+\\varepsilon \\sigma _ { l}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the angle between the outgoing and incoming electrons , @xmath10 is the outgoing electron energy , and @xmath11 is the outgoing pion momentum . the mott cross section is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 . if the photon four - momentum is denoted as @xmath14 , the other kinematic factors in eq.(1 ) are @xmath15 here we have defined @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the deuteron mass and @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] being the invariant mass of the @xmath20 system . from the above definitions , one can show that the longitudinal cross section @xmath21 and transverse cross section @xmath22 in eq.(1 ) are related to the structure functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath25 , \\\\",
    "\\sigma _ { l}&=&\\frac{4\\pi ^{2}\\alpha } { k}\\left [ \\frac{\\left|   \\vec{q}\\right| ^{2 } } { q^{2}}w_{2}+w_{1}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the structure functions can be calculated from @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the photon polarization , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the z - component of the @xmath31-th nucleon and the deuteron respectively .",
    "the pion momentum is @xmath11 and the momenta of the outgoing two nucleons are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the energy variables are defined as @xmath34 for the pion and @xmath35 for the nucleon .",
    "the isospin variables are suppressed to simplify the presentation .    for the considered reaction mechanisms illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] , the total amplitude in eqs.(7)-(8 )",
    "is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the deuteron wavefunction , and @xmath38 explicitly , the impulse term(fig.3a ) is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pion electroproduction operator on the @xmath41th nucleon .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon @xmath2 final state interaction term(fig.3b ) is @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the @xmath2 scattering operator and @xmath44 is the free energy operator for the pion .",
    "the @xmath2 propagator is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the free energy operator for the @xmath41th nucleon .",
    "the pion rescattering term(fig.[fig3]b ) is defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath5 scattering operator on the @xmath41th nucleon , and the @xmath1 propagator is defined by @xmath49 the baryon - baryon interaction term(fig.[fig3]d ) is @xmath50 where the vertex interactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 describe the @xmath53 and @xmath54 transitions respectively .",
    "in addition to @xmath55 defined by eq.(13 ) , eq.(16 ) also depends on the @xmath56 propagator .",
    "it is defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the free energy operator for the @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the @xmath59 self - energy evaluated in the presence of a spectator nucleon .    in our calculations ,",
    "the matrix element of @xmath40 is generated from the sl model .",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath5 scattering operator @xmath61 , the baryon - baryon scattering operator @xmath62 with @xmath63 are generated from the @xmath1 model developed in ref.@xcite . therefore , our calculations of the total amplitude eq.(9 ) and the @xmath0 cross sections are free of adjustable parameters .",
    "we first consider the data from saclay @xcite in 1990 . in fig.4",
    ", we show the relative importance between the four amplitudes illustrated in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we see that the impulse term(solid curve ) dominates .",
    "the final @xmath2 interaction(dashed curve ) gives comparable contributions only at energies very close to the threshold .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this region the energy of the outgoing @xmath2 state is very low and the final @xmath2 interaction is dominanted by the attractive @xmath64 force .",
    "the contributions from the pion rescattering mechanism(dot - dashed curve ) and the @xmath65 mechanism(dotted curve ) are clearly very weak .    in fig.[fig5 ] , we compare the predicted cross sections(solid curve ) with the data@xcite .",
    "we see that the general feature of the data is reproduced",
    ". however , the discrepancy is rather significant in the region where the missing mass is close to 1900 mev .",
    "this could be due to the deficiency of the sl model or the higher order reaction mechanisms which are neglected in this work . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the results(dashed curve ) from the impluse term only .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath1 interaction mechanisms , illustrated in figs.([fig3]b-[fig3]d ) , yield an about 10 @xmath66 effect in the region near the peak position . we have found that this is mainly due to the interference between the impulse amplitude and the fsi amplitude .",
    "the effects due to pion rescattering and @xmath65 interactions are negligible .",
    "we next consider a recent experiment at jlab@xcite .",
    "the calculated cross sections from each mechanism illustrated in fig.3 are compared in fig.[fig6 ] . here",
    "the @xmath65 interaction term(dotted curve ) and the pion rescattering term(dot - dashed curve ) become comparable .",
    "however , the impulse term(solid curve ) is much larger than the other terms .",
    "accordingly , the effects due to the @xmath1 ( rescattering ) mechanisms is much less .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig7 ] . in the same figure",
    ", we also see that the predicted cross sections are about 20 @xmath66 lower than the data .",
    "this perhaps is mainly due to the deficiency of the sl model in this @xmath67 ( gev / c)@xmath68 region .",
    "however , it could be due to the neglect of higher order reaction mechanisms .",
    "we now turn to discussing how the measured longitudinal cross sections can be used to learn about the medium effects on the pion form factor and/or @xmath1 vertex of the pion pole term .",
    "first we need to know the effect due to the @xmath1 mechanisms . as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , this effect only reduces the longitudinal cross section by about 5 @xmath66 .",
    "second , we need to know the contribution from the pion pole term . for the considered parallel kinematics , the pion pole term(fig.[fig2]a ) indeed dominates . on the other hand , the other mechanisms in figs.[fig1]-[fig2 ] can still have large effects through their interference with the pion pole term .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig8 ] where we see that the pion pole term alone only gives about 50 @xmath66 of the longitudinal cross section .",
    "one thus must be cautious in interpreting the measured longitudinal cross sections in terms of the medium effects on pion form factor and/or @xmath1 vertex .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the @xmath0 reaction for parallel kinematics by using a dynamical model of pion electroproduction on the nucleon .",
    "we have found that the effects due to the final two - nucleon interactions , pion rescattering from the second nucleon and the intermediate @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions to be small .",
    "but they can have significant contributions to the @xmath0 cross sections through their interference with the dominant impulse term .",
    "for the longitudinal cross sections , the effects due to the interference between the pion pole term and other production mechanisms are also found to be very large .",
    "our findings indicate that these interference effects must be accounted for in any attempt to determine from the @xmath0 data whether the pion form factor and/or @xmath1 vertex of the pion pole term are modified in the nuclear medium .",
