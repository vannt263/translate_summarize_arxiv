    "experimental observations and robust theoretical arguments have established that our universe is essentially non - visible , the luminous matter scarcely accounting for one per cent of the energy density of a flat universe .",
    "the distribution of a flat universe ( @xmath0 ) attributes to the dark energy about @xmath1 , whereas the matter density takes the remaining @xmath2 , consisting of , both , visible ( @xmath3 ) and non - visible ( dark ) matter .",
    "this dark component is formed by ordinary baryonic matter ( @xmath4 ) , ( possibly made by machos , jupiters , dust , black holes , etc . ) and a large fraction ( up to @xmath5 ) of non baryonic dark matter , supposedly made by non - conventional , exotic particles .",
    "these non - baryonic particles ( usually named particle dark matter ) would be filling the galactic halos , at least partially , according to a variety of models .",
    "it is supposed to be a suitable mixture ( cold and hot dark matter ) to properly generate the cosmic structures .",
    "the minimal requirements to be fulfilled by the non - baryonic dark particles are to provide the right relic abundance , to have non - zero mass , zero electric charge and very weak interaction with ordinary matter .",
    "there are several candidates to such species of matter provided by schemes beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "remarkable examples are the axions , wimps ( weak interacting massive particles ) and neutrinos .",
    "axions are pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the peccei - quin @xmath6 symmetry invented to solve the strong cp problem .",
    "they are very weakly coupled to ordinary matter ; examples are the galactic dm axions of the models ksuz and dfsz .",
    "axions with large @xmath7 are good candidates to dark matter , where @xmath8 is the energy scale of the pq symmetry breaking .",
    "the more favorable mass window for this candidate is @xmath9 .",
    "another popular candidate are the weak interacting , neutral and massive particle , called wimps . a particularly attractive kind of wimps are provided by the susy models , like the neutralinos ( the lightest stable particles -lsp- ) of super symmetric theories .",
    "the lowest - mass neutralino is a linear superposition of photino , zino , higgsino , expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 gaugino ; @xmath13 higgsino .",
    "the mass window of this candidate is @xmath14 .",
    "an interesting mass region , for reasons which will become clear later on , is that of @xmath15 .",
    "the last candidate is the ( non - zero mass ) neutrino of theories beyond the standard model .",
    "the neutrinos are the only candidate known to exist , have well - known weak interaction and only a small amount of them is needed to explain cosmic data .",
    "their mass - window is very wide according to the particular model ( to fit also other phenomenology of @xmath16-physics ) .",
    "it is to be noticed that the masses of the non baryonic particle candidates extend along more than 18 orders of magnitude :  @xmath17  ev - @xmath18  ev . on the other hand , all the candidates have a common feature : their small interaction cross section with ordinary matter . in the case of wimps , for instance , various implementations of the minimal susy extension of the standard model , mssm , lead to an interaction cross - sections wimp - matter , @xmath19 , encompassing several orders of magnitude from @xmath20 down to @xmath21  pb . this cross - section plays a leading role in the estimation of the sensitivity required in particle dark matter searches .",
    "this talk will be devoted only to one of these candidates : the wimps . without entering into considerations about how large the baryonic dark component of the galactic halo could be ,",
    "we take for granted that there is enough room for wimps in our halo to try to detect them , either directly or through their by - products .",
    "discovering this form of dark matter is one of the big challenges in cosmology , astrophysics and particle physics .",
    "wimps can be looked for either directly or indirectly through its byproducts .",
    "the indirect detection of wimps proceeds currently through two main experimental lines : either by looking in cosmic rays experiments for positrons , antiprotons , or other antinuclei produced by the wimps annihilation in the halo ( like in the caprice , bess , ams , glast , veritas , magic experiments ... ) , or by searching in large underground detectors ( superkamiokande , sno , soudan , macro ) or underwater neutrino telescopes ( baikal , amanda , antares , nestor ) for upward - going muons produced by the energetic neutrinos emerging as final products of the wimps annihilation in celestial bodies ( sun , earth ... ) .",
    "the direct detection of wimps relies in measuring the nuclear recoil produced by their elastic scattering off target nuclei in suitable detectors .",
    "the signal rate depends of the type of wimp and interaction , whereas simple kinematics says that the energy delivered in the wimp - nucleus interaction is very small . in the case of wimps of @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 the nuclear recoil energy in the laboratory frame @xmath24 is in the range from 1 to 100 kev .",
    "@xmath25 is the nuclear mass , @xmath26 the ( @xmath27 ) reduced mass and @xmath28 the wimp - nucleus ( c. of m. ) scattering angle .",
    "even small the recoil energy , only a fraction @xmath29 of it is visible in the detector , depending on the type of detector and target and on the mechanism of energy deposition .",
    "the so - called quenching factor q is essentially unit in thermal detectors whereas for the nuclei used in conventional detectors it ranges from about 0.1 to 0.6 . for instance for a ge nucleus only about 1/4 of the recoil energy goes to ionization .    on the other hand ,",
    "the smallness of the neutralino - matter interaction cross - section makes the rates of the nuclear recoil looked for very small .",
    "the variety of models and parameters used to describe the astrophysics , particle physics and nuclear physics aspects of the process makes , as stated before , the neutralino - nucleus interaction rate encompass several orders of magnitude , going from 10 to @xmath20 c / kg day , according to the susy model and parameters @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is not higher than @xmath30 c / kg day , for the neutralino parameters which provide the most favourable relic density .    the rare ( @xmath31 c / kg.day ) and small ( kev range )",
    "wimp signal falls in the low energy region of the spectrum , where the radioactive and environmental background accumulate at much faster rate and with similar spectral shape . that makes wimp signal and background practically undistinguishable . in conclusion",
    ", due to the properties of the expected signals , the direct search for particle dark matter through their scattering by nuclear targets requires ultralow background detectors of a very low energy threshold , endowed , when possible , with background discrimination mechanisms .",
    "all these features together make the wimp detection a formidable experimental challenge .",
    "this review will deal with the efforts currently being done in the direct search of wimps illustrated by a few experiments .",
    "only conventional , non - cryogenic detectors , will be considered in this review ( the case for cryogenics detectors will be addressed in the review of l. mosca , in these proceedings ) . the signals to be expected , their main features , the techniques employed and the achievements accomplished will be overviewed . the current results and prospects will be also sketched .",
    "the method to explore wether there exists or not a wimp signal contribution in the experimental data is rather simple : one compares the predicted event rate with the observed spectrum ; if the former turns out to be larger than the measured one , the particle which would produce such event rate can be ruled out as a dark matter candidate .",
    "that is expressed as a contour line @xmath32(m ) in the plane of the wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross section versus the wimp mass .",
    "for each mass m , those particles with a cross - section above the contour line @xmath32(m ) are excluded as dark matter . the level of background sets , consequently , the sensitivity of the experiment to eliminate candidates or in constraining their masses and cross sections .",
    "thus , the first effort to be done in looking for wimps must be on diminishing the general background and then in discriminating the background from the signal ( nucleus recoil generated by wimps )",
    ".    however , this mere comparison of the expected signal with the experimentally observed spectrum it is not expected , in principle , to lead to the wimp s detection , unless one reach a reliable zero - background ideal spectrum . in the general case , the real spectrum , even small , which has typically the same shape than that of the signal , could be due to pure background sources . after the identification and rejection of most of background sources",
    ", there still exists a worrisome background originated by the neutrons which produce also nuclear recoils similar to the produced by wimps .",
    "this ultimate background must be identified and eliminated . however",
    ", a convincing proof of the detection of wimps would need to invent and discover signatures in the data characteristic of the wimps but not of the background .",
    "there exist temporal and spatial asymmetries specific of the wimp interaction , which are difficult to be faked by the background or by instrumental artifacts .",
    "they are due to the kinematics of the motion of the earth ( and of our detectors ) in the galactic halo .",
    "these signatures are an annual modulation of the rate and a directional asymmetry of the nuclear recoil ( see later on )",
    ". both types of asymmetries are not characteristics of the background and , in principle , can be used as identification labels of the wimps .",
    "the only distinctive signature seriously investigated up to now is the annual modulation of the wimp signal rate due to the seasonal variation produced by the earth s motion with respect to the sun .",
    "several experiments have looked for such seasonal variations of the rates and , in fact , the dama experiment , after four yearly period of data has found an annual modulation at the @xmath33 level , which has been associated , by the dama collaboration , to the existence of a wimp .    from the experimentalist point of view , to detect wimps one need first to narrow the window ( @xmath32,m ) of its possible existence , by means of the exclusion plots , and then try its identification through one , or more , of its distinctive features .",
    "the detectors used so far in the quest for wimps ( and references later on ) are : ionization detectors of ge ( igex , cosme , h / m , hdms ) and of si ( ucsb ) , scintillation crystals of nai ( zaragoza , dama , ukdmc , saclay , elegants ) , liquid or liquid - gas xenon detectors ( dama , ucla , ukdmc , zeplin ) , calcium fluoride scintillators ( milan , osaka , roma ) , thermal detectors ( bolometers ) with sapphire absorbers ( cresst , rosebud ) , with tellurite absorbers , ( mibeta , cuoricino ) or with germanium absorbers ( rosebud ) as well as bolometers which also measure the ionization , like that of si ( cdms ) and of ge ( cdms , edelweiss ) .",
    "new techniques have been recently incorporated .",
    "worth to be mentioned are : scintillating bolometers of calcium tungstate which measure heat and high ( cresst and rosebud ) , and of bgo ( rosebud ) ; a tpc sensitive to the direction of the nuclear recoil ( drift ) ; devices which use superheated droplets ( simple and picasso ) , or those which use colloids of superconducting superheated grains ( orpheus ) .",
    "there exist also projects featuring a large amount of target nuclei in segmented detectors , both with ionization ge detectors ( genius , gedeon ) and cryogenic thermal devices ( cuore ) .",
    "table [ tabla1 ] gives a rough account of the `` history '' of wimp searches .",
    "table [ tabla2 ] gives an overview of the experiments on direct detection of wimps currently in operation or in preparation .",
    "general reviews on wimps can be found in ref @xcite whereas neutralino dark matter has been extensively described in ref @xcite ( see also the a. bottino talk in these proceedings ) .",
    "wimp direct detection are reviewed , for instance in ref @xcite .",

    "these strategies must be focussed in getting a much lower background ( intrinsic , environmental , ... ) by improving radiopurity and shielding .",
