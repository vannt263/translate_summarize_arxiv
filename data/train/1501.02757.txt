    "the skyrmion spin texture induces one flux quantum of an effective magnetic field acting on spin - polarized electrons and magnons , which gives rise to topological hall effects in charge and heat transport and at the same sets skyrmions into motion @xcite .",
    "low critical currents needed to manipulate skyrmions opened a new active field of research - skyrmionics , which has a goal of developing skyrmion - based magnetic memory and data processing devices @xcite .",
    "so far , skyrmions have only been found in a handful of materials , all with the non - centrosymmetric cubic b20 structure , in which the relativistic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction turns a collinear spin state into a helical spiral . under an applied magnetic field",
    "the spiral transforms into the skyrmion crystal ( skx ) with a triangular magnetic superlattice .",
    "further increase of the magnetic field results in a transition to the saturated ferromagnetic state , in which isolated skyrmions exist as stable topological defects @xcite .",
    "skyrmions are close relatives of magnetic bubbles ( cylindrical domains ) and the transformation of the helical spiral into skx is analogous to the field - induced transition between the stripe domain state and the bubble array taking place in thin ferromagnetic films . in the framework of landau theory",
    "the bubble array is described by three coexisting spin modulations with the wave vectors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which add to zero .",

    "competes with the conical spiral state and an additional order - from - disorder mechanism - stabilization by thermal spin fluctuations - was invoked to explain why skyrmions are only observed at elevated temperatures @xcite .",
    "practical applications of skyrmions crucially depend on finding new classes of skyrmion materials and new microscopic mechanisms for their stabilization .",

    "we clarify the nature of the phases found in numerical simulations and present results of analytical studies of instability of spiral states towards additional periodic modulations .",

    "we also explore very rich physics of isolated skyrmions in frustrated magnets .",
    "we find that their monopole and toroidal moment densities oscillate with the distance from the skyrmion centre , which gives rise to alternation of attraction and repulsion between skyrmions , clustering of skyrmions in high magnetic fields and stability of skyrmions with the topological charge 2 .",
    "dynamics of skyrmions in frustrated magnets is different from that in chiral magnets because of the additional collective degree of freedom - skyrmion helicity .",

    "an interesting question is why the 2__q _ _ and skyrmion crystal states are favoured by both the entropic mechanism in absence of anisotropy @xcite and the magnetic anisotropy at zero temperature ? the common origin seems to be the soft magnetic excitation spectrum of multi-_q _ states , which on the one hand lowers free energy of these states by increasing their entropy and , on the other hand , lowers their energy by enhancing susceptibility to magnetic field and anisotropy .",
    "soft magnetic modes of multi-_q _ states , which can be excited by both electric and magnetic fields , lead to large magnetoelectric responses .",
    "finally , we list a few requirements for stabilization of skyrmions in frustrated magnets following from our study , which can be used as guidelines in the search for new materials hosting skyrmions : ( 1 ) spiral spin ordering in zero magnetic field resulting from competing exchange interactions ; ( 2 ) three - fold or six - fold symmetry axis , which ensures that the spirals with the three wave vectors , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath2 forming the skyrmion crystal , have the same energy ; although cubic lattice symmetry does not favour the three vectors lying in the same plane , it results in a weak dependence of the exchange energy on @xmath78 , which may be sufficient ; ( 3 ) easy axis magnetic anisotropy axis stabilizing multi-_q _ states .",
    "although these requirements are not very demanding and some of them are met in niga@xmath178s@xmath179 @xcite , @xmath95-nafeo@xmath178 @xcite , dihalides nibr@xmath178 and fe@xmath180ni@xmath181br@xmath178 @xcite , it is a challenge to find a material which satisfies them all .",
    "the energy ( [ energy ] ) has been minimized using the iterative simulated annealing procedure and a single - step monte - carlo dynamics with the metropolis algorithm ( for details see ref .",
    "we imposed periodic boundary conditions and performed simulations for lattices of different sizes to check the stability of the numerical routine .",
    "the dynamical magnetic susceptibility for all multi-_q _ states and the time evolution of spins in the oscillating magnetic field have been obtained by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation using the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the dimensionless damping parameter @xmath182 . to obtain initial spin configurations",
    ", we used the annealing technique supplemented by a further llg relaxation for @xmath183 . when the convergence of the spin configurations was reached , we switched on a periodic magnetic field in the plane @xmath5 to study the spin dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] ) or applied a magnetic field pulse at @xmath184 and monitored the response , to obtain the magnetic susceptibility ( fig .  [ fig : polarization]c ) .    the skyrmion - skyrmion and skyrmion - antiskyrmion interaction potentials shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interactions ] , were calculated by minimizing the spin energy with the constraint , @xmath185 , imposed at the centres of the topological defects . to calculate the helicity dependence of the interactions",
    ", we constrained the helicity angle at six sites neighbouring to the skyrmion centre and imposed @xmath186 at these sites , which holds for an isolated skyrmion .",
