    "in recent years , much effort has been devoted to the study of synchronization of networks of coupled dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "important results have been obtained under the assumption that communication between the connected systems is immediate ; i.e. , the signal from system @xmath0 at time @xmath1 is received by systems @xmath2 at the same time @xmath1 .",
    "most of these studies have also focused on the case where the network topology is static , i.e. , the coupling strengths between the connected systems is fixed and does not evolve in time . yet in real situations networks of dynamical systems are often time - varying and affected by communication delays . in this paper",
    "we will address situations incorporating both the time varying structure common in typical real networks and the delays which inherently affect communication across the network .",
    "our main emphasis will be on the situation where the time - dependent connection strength from system @xmath2 to another system @xmath0 in the network is unknown by system @xmath0 , and we investigate how system @xmath0 can deduce these strengths by an adaptive strategy making use of the phenomenon of synchronization of chaos .",
    "as we shall show , diversity in the delay time associated with different links , as well as chaos of the exchanged signals , will play a crucial role in achieving this goal .    as a possible motivation",
    ", we will consider as our reference application that of a network of sensors that are dispersed over a ground and interact with each other through direct wireless communication .",
    "namely , we will assume that the sensor network is employed to detect the evolution of the configuration within the surveyed area , e.g. , due to motions of objects on the ground .",
    "in that case , a movement of an object across a communication pathway affects the strength of the signals exchanged by the nodes at its endpoints .",
    "therefore , if we can succeed in identifying the time - evolution of the network couplings , this will provide information potentially enabling us to localize the position of the objects moving across the ground .",
    "we consider that each of the dynamical systems ( ` nodes ' ) are identical chaotic systems broadcasting chaotic signals .",
    "as the network evolves , each node uses an adaptive strategy ( which we specify ) to maintain synchronization , and , in so doing , it determines the strengths of the couplings to it .",
    "moreover , we will also show how our adaptive strategy could greatly benefit from the introduction of a special node , having the specific function of maintaining network synchronization . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to this particular node as the _ maestro _ , in order to distinguish it from the remaining nodes of the network , which we will refer to as the _",
    "orchestra_. for example , for the case of our reference application , we will make the assumption that this node is positioned in such a way that the strength of the signal sent by this node is not affected by the movements of the objects on the ground ( e.g. , it might be located atop a tower , hill or tall building ) .",
    "we will see that when such an arrangement is realized , it will become possible to effectively identify the time evolution of much larger networks than would be possible in the absence of a maestro .",
    "the problem of identifying the structure of real complex networks , arises in all those situations where the exact network topological structure is unknown or uncertain , therefore it is of relevance in various fields of science and technologies .",
    "examples are metabolic networks , biological neural networks , electric power grids , and so on @xcite . moreover , in many real world situations , there is often an intrinsic difficulty in extracting information on the network structure .",
    "hence , the problem of learning the network topology , represents a challenge in a number of real applications , that involve both natural and man - made systems @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii we present our proposed adaptive strategy for maintaining synchronization of chaos and determining network topology .",
    "we do this both for the case with no maestro and for the case with a maestro .",
    "we also show that it is essential for our technique that signals be chaotic and experience time delays along the links of the network . in sec .",
    "iii we test our strategy through numerical experiments .",
    "we show that the presence of a maestro can greatly benefit our strategy .",
    "conclusions and further discussion are presented in sec .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we showed how a time - varying complex network can be synchronized by using a ` potential ' that each network node seeks to minimize . in this paper",
    ", we will extend this concept with the goal , of not only maintaining synchronization , but of also identifying the time - varying evolution of the network itself . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown how to identify the static structure of a complex network of synchronizing systems by introducing a response ( replica ) network that can adjust its couplings to converge to those of the original one .",
    "the main focus of our paper will be on identifying the evolution of time - varying couplings of a complex network from limited information .",
    "we will show how this may be achieved by solving a small number of auxiliary differential equation , provided that some general conditions on the time delays of the network links are met .",
    "we will consider two versions of our problem . in _",
    "version i _ the maestro is absent , while in _ version ii _ we have a maestro .    in _ version i _ , the set of dynamical equations describing the dynamical state vector @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 at each node @xmath0 of the time evolving network is the following : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the _ incoming signal _ at node @xmath0 , which is a linear combination of the different scalar _ transmitted signals _",
    "@xmath7 , through the time varying coupling coefficients @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9^t$ ] is a constant @xmath4-vector specifying the coupling of the scalar received signal @xmath10 to node @xmath0 .",
    "( in our numerical experiments in sec .",
    "iii , we will take the components of @xmath11 to be all zero except for one component , say @xmath12 , for which @xmath13 . )",
    "we assume that the time delays @xmath14 , between each pair of connected nodes @xmath0 and @xmath2 , are known , e.g. , the sensors occupy fixed positions and thus the communication delays can be easily obtained from knowledge of the relative distances between the sensors .",
    "in contrast , we assume that the strengths of the network interactions , represented by the @xmath15 , are unknown and variable in time . here , the @xmath8 s might represent the spreading , scattering , and attenuation of a wireless output signal broadcast by node @xmath2 to node @xmath0 . in the case where the input to @xmath0 from @xmath2 is accomplished by propagation of an electromagnetic wave from @xmath2 to @xmath0",
    ", the link strength @xmath15 will vary with time as a body moves through the propagation path from @xmath2 to @xmath0 .",
    "although the @xmath8 vary with time , we shall be most interested in the case where the time scale for this variation is slow compared to the natural time scale of the chaotic dynamics of an individual uncoupled system , @xmath16 the quantity @xmath17 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ np ] ) represents an estimate made at node @xmath0 of the true coupling @xmath8 .",
    "how this estimate can be made , as well as the accuracy of the estimate , will be the main focus of this paper . in _ version ii _ , we consider an additional dynamical state vector , i.e. , @xmath18 , associated with the maestro node , and the following set of dynamical equations : @xmath19\\ }   ,   \\quad i=1,2, ... ,n , \\label{np2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and the maestro obeys the same dynamical evolution as an uncoupled node , i.e. , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the strength of the coupling of the maestro to each node @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the communication delay between the maestro and node @xmath23 ; @xmath25 is a parameter that tunes the relative strength of the coupling exerted on the network nodes by the maestro , with respect to that of the other nodes in the network ( the orchestra ) . when @xmath26 , each node is affected only by the forcing by the maestro , and therefore it can be seen as an isolated slave system connected to the master . on the other hand , when @xmath27 , each node will not feel the influence of the maestro and synchronization can only be realized from the mutual coupling with the other nodes in the network ( the orchestra ) ; thus the case @xmath27 corresponds to our problem in version i. values of @xmath28 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the case of most interest ) correspond to intermediate situations where each node feels both the influence of the maestro , as well as that of the orchestra . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is known a priori at each node @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iii.d we also address the case that the assumed known coupling with the maestro is affected by a small error .    in the particular case where we actually have the correct estimates",
    "@xmath31 , the network equations in ( [ np ] ) and ( [ np2 ] ) , can be rewritten as    @xmath32    thus , in a similar way to the case of a network of coupled oscillators without delays or time variability of the coupling @xmath15 @xcite , the synchronization manifold ,    @xmath33    represents an invariant set for the set of equations ( [ n1 ] ) or ( [ n2 ] ) .",
    "once the dynamical functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are assigned , the stability of synchronized states to perturbations from the synchronization manifold will depend on the dynamical evolution of the network adjacency matrix @xmath36 , on the overall coupling @xmath11 , and on the time delays @xmath14 ( plus on @xmath22 and @xmath24 in the case of version 2 ) . in what follows",
    ", we will proceed under the assumption that the synchronization manifold ( [ sm ] - [ sm2 ] ) is stable for our choices of the time evolution of @xmath36 , @xmath22 , @xmath11 and the time delays @xmath14 and @xmath24 , and we will focus on the problem of identifying the network structure ( i.e. , obtaining the estimates @xmath37 ) .",
    "we assume that at each node @xmath0 direct information on the couplings @xmath8 is unavailable .",
    "thus , the estimates @xmath17 at node @xmath0 must be obtained solely using the aggregate incoming signal @xmath38 . in order to make this estimate",
    ", we introduce a ` potential ' @xmath39 at each node @xmath0 :    @xmath40    if the time scale for variation of @xmath17 is larger than @xmath41 , then @xmath42 can be approximated by    @xmath43    as given by ( [ tri ] ) and ( [ tri2 ] ) , the potential @xmath39 is approximately the time averaged squared synchronization error , and @xmath41 is the temporal extent over which the averaging is performed .",
    "note from ( [ tri ] ) that @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , from ( [ tri2 ] ) we note that @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 . due to the chaotic nature of the @xmath47 s ,",
    "provided that the @xmath14 are all distinct , these conditions can only be satisfied if @xmath48 ( i.e. , our estimates of the time evolutions of the network couplings are correct ) and @xmath49 ( i.e. , the network systems are synchronized in time ) .",
    "thus we seek to minimize @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we impose that the @xmath37 evolve according to the following gradient descent relation :    @xmath50 , \\label{sei2 } \\qquad \\mbox{for version 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a constant larger than zero .    in practice",
    "it is useful to avoid doing the above integrations at each time step of our adaptive computation .",
    "rather , we note that @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 given by ( [ cpi ] ) and ( [ cgr ] ) , and ( [ cs ] ) satisfy simple differential equations , and we employ these in our adaptive computation of @xmath37 : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    the simplest version of this setup , used in our numerical example in sec .",
    "iii , corresponds to letting @xmath61 , in which case eqs .",
    "( 11 ) implies that we can obtain the @xmath62 by solving the system of linear equations ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are obtained by solving ( [ sette ] ) , ( [ otto ] ) , and ( [ nove ] ) .    according to our previous discussion ( in particular , the condition for the approximate equality in eq .",
    "( [ tri ] ) ) , in order for our identification strategy to work properly we should choose @xmath67 such that it is in the intermediate range , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the time scale of the chaotic dynamics of an uncoupled nodal system ( @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 is the time scale on which the network itself changes ( i.e. the time scale on which @xmath8 varies ) .",
    "we will subsequently give quantitative definitions of @xmath69 and @xmath71 for our examples .",
    "we emphasize that we try to identify the time evolutions of the _ several _",
    "@xmath15 s , by using only _ one _ piece of external information at each node @xmath0 , namely , the incoming signal @xmath38 .",
    "our ability to extract estimates for the @xmath72 values of @xmath8 ( @xmath73 ) at each node @xmath0 from each incoming signal , relies on the temporal signal diversity of @xmath38 due to the presence of both chaos and _ different _ time delays along the network links . to illustrate the necessity of different time delays ,",
    "consider the following example .",
    "assume , for instance , that our network consists of three coupled systems in the version i scenario ( @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , and we want to identify the time evolutions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 when the only available information at node 1 is @xmath77 , the time evolution of the incoming signal at node 1 . if we are on the synchronization manifold , then eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yield @xmath78 h(x_1(t-\\tau_{12}))+ [ a_{13}(t)-\\bar{a}_{13}(t ) ] h(x_1(t-\\tau_{13 } ) ) \\ } , \\label{unoduetre}\\ ] ] and , for @xmath79 , the @xmath35 terms are equal , yielding for the term in ( [ unoduetre ] ) that is in curly brackets @xmath80 - [ a_{13}(t)-\\bar{a}_{13}(t ) ]   \\}.\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath81 , we see that we could obtain synchronization at node @xmath30 for any @xmath82 and @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , and we can not hope to estimate _ both _ @xmath85 and @xmath86 only from @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath87 , then on the synchronization manifold @xmath88 and the previous degeneracy is removed .",
    "thus we now have the possibility that it may be feasible to obtain the desired two unknowns @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; in other words , it may become possible to obtain good estimates @xmath82 and @xmath83 , provided that @xmath87 .",
    "hence the presence of different delays is crucial in the identification process .    moreover our strategy benefits from the chaotic nature of the exchanged signals at the network nodes . in particular , we take advantage of the high information content encoded in chaotic signals . as an illustrative counterexample , assume that , in place of the chaotic signals , we had sine waves of the same frequency broadcast by the network systems .",
    "the communication delays would result in phase shifts of the sine waves , and the signal received at each node , being the sum of sinusoids of the same frequency , would be a sinusoidal signal . in this case",
    ", there would be no information content in the received signal other than its amplitude and phase ; therefore , we would not be able to extract more than two pieces of information from it .",
    "as a first example , we consider the problem in version i [ eqs .",
    "( [ np ] ) and ( [ ri ] ) ] , and we seek to estimate the time evolution of a small network of @xmath74 nodes and @xmath89 directed links ( two directed links incoming to each node ) . for our uncoupled dynamical system , @xmath90 , we consider a rssler oscillator , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . \\label{f}\\ ] ] we choose the oscillators to be coupled in the @xmath93 variable , i.e. , @xmath94 , @xmath95^t$ ] , @xmath96 .",

    "note that for each @xmath0 , the @xmath14 for every @xmath107 are all unequal . for our choice in eq .",

    "we assume the following network evolution , @xmath110 where the @xmath111 are random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the @xmath112 are random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and the @xmath115 are random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath29 and @xmath116 .",
    "we define the network evolution time scale @xmath71 for our example to be @xmath117 .",

    "we take @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . using these parameters",
    "we have that the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ inu ] ) are satisfied : @xmath129 .",
    "the computations were done over a time interval @xmath130 .    to measure the extent to which our strategy works we introduce the following two error measures : @xmath131 where @xmath132 and",

    "are identical to within the width of the plotted curves .",
    "figure [ a2](a ) shows that @xmath140 is typically less than @xmath141 over the entire run , while fig .",
    "[ a2](b ) shows that the synchronization error @xmath142 is typically less than @xmath143 .",
    "these results confirm that our adaptive strategy is effective in synchronizing the network and that the @xmath37 closely follow the evolutions of the time evolution of the true couplings @xmath144 ( see fig .",

    "[ f2 ] , for this case our identification strategy fails , with the @xmath17 deviating from the evolution of the @xmath147 . at the same time",
    ", we observe from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] that the network systems evolve approximately synchronously in time .",
    "thus , in this case we can approximately synchronize the network , but we fail in correctly estimating the evolution of the network couplings .    unfortunately , by using the strategy in version i , we were not able to synchronize complete graphs of rssler oscillators , as the network dimension @xmath148 was increased .",
    "as we will explain in the appendix of this paper , we have an understanding of the reason for this failure .",
    "briefly , a requirement for correctly estimating @xmath15 at any given node , say @xmath0 , is that the @xmath14 s associated with @xmath0 are different enough ( we address this issue more rigorously in the appendix ) .",
    "however , if @xmath148 is too large , we can not make the @xmath14 too separated , because stability of the synchronization manifold ( [ sm ] ) ( under the condition @xmath31 ) , is lost if the @xmath14 s are too large .",
    "thus , for our setup in version i , achieving the required diversity in the @xmath14 s , contrasts with our requirement of having the network synchronize .",
    "we have also tested our version i scenario for a case as in figs . 1 - 3 , but with the network evolving on a faster time scale @xmath149 ( instead of @xmath150 ) , and for this faster evolution we have found that our strategy fails ( results not shown ) .",
    "the failure of our method with large @xmath148 when applied to version i is the main reason for considering in what follows the alternative set up of our problem in version ii [ eqs .",
    "( [ np2 ] ) and ( [ ri2 ] ) ] , which incorporates a maestro node , having the function of maintaining the network synchronizability .",
    "thus we assume that each node / dynamical system is subject to two actions : a _ coupling exerted by the other nodes of the network _ , which in what follows we will refer to as _ the orchestra _ and a _ coupling exerted by a master system _ , which in what follows we will refer to as _ the maestro_. by tuning the parameter @xmath28 in ( [ np2 ] ) and ( [ ri2 ] ) between @xmath29 and @xmath30 we are able to interpolate between a situation where the nodes feel only the influence of the maestro and a situation where they feel only the influence of the orchestra ( corresponding to version i ) .",
    "we assume that the maestro coupling @xmath151 is known and time independent , but that the other network couplings , @xmath15 , are time - varying and unknown at the network nodes . in order to guarantee that the synchronization manifold is stable ,",
    "we take the time delays with the maestro @xmath24 to be small enough .",
    "our hope is that , once synchronization is ensured through the maestro , we will potentially be able to choose the other @xmath14 s so that they are sufficiently spread that we have a much greater likelihood of being able to correctly estimate the @xmath8 .",

    ". [ fcsi ] , the larger the error , the worse our strategy performs .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath203 , for example , for @xmath205 , the synchronization and identification errors are respectively less than @xmath206 and @xmath207 , i.e. , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , thus indicating that good results may still be obtained provided that the coupling with the maestro is affected by a not too large error .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence of our strategy on the parameter @xmath28 for the case in which small mismatches in the coupling with the maestro are present , i.e. , @xmath210 .",
    "this is shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] .",
    "as can be seen , for such a case , our strategy works in a bounded interval of values of the parameter @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath211 , indicating that under these conditions , the best setup is realized when synchronization depends on both the influence of the maestro , as well as that of the orchestra .",
    "in this paper we have dealt with the problem of identifying the time - evolutions of the couplings ( assumed unknown ) associated with the links of a network by making use of the phenomenon of chaos synchronization .",
    "we considered networks with time varying strengths of the couplings ( due the effects of external unpredictable factors ) , as well as different coupling delays affecting the communication between the nodes .",
    "we proposed an adaptive strategy based on the concept of a ` potential ' that the network systems seek to minimize in order to identify the time evolutions of the network couplings .",
    "we considered fully connected networks of @xmath148 nodes and showed how our strategy could be successfully applied to identify the @xmath72 unknown couplings at each of the network nodes .",
    "we emphasize that , we achieved this goal by using very little information exchanged at the network nodes : namely the coupling was realized in only one state variable , and the only available information at each node at time @xmath1 was an aggregate incoming signal from the other nodes , @xmath38 ( compare for instance our approach with others previously reported in the literature @xcite ) . here",
    "we took advantage both of the phenomenon of synchronization of chaos and of the temporal signal diversity of the signal @xmath38 due to the presence of _ different _ time delays over the network links .",
    "we proposed two alternative versions of our strategy . in the first one , synchronization had to be achieved at each node ( as well as the identification of the couplings over the network links ) , based solely on the information received from the other nodes in the network .",
    "for this case , we showed that we were able to correctly identify the evolution of the couplings in the case of small networks , i.e. , a network of @xmath74 nodes , whose time evolution was sufficiently slow .    in order to extend and improve our results",
    ", we introduced a second version of our strategy , where we made use of an additional node , termed the maestro , having the function of maintaining network synchronization .",
    "we made the assumption that the coupling with the maestro was known at the other network nodes and that the maestro was not affected by the dynamics of the other nodes in the network .",
    "we showed that such an arrangement could lead to much better results than in the case where the maestro was absent .",
    "in particular , we were able to identify the time evolution of networks that were larger and more rapidly evolving than was possible in the other case .",
    "other possible setups of our strategy are also possible , e.g. , a selective choice of the nodes to be connected to the maestro ( pinning control ) .",
    "in our experiment in figs . [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] , and [ f3 ] ( version 1 , @xmath212 ) we observed that we were able to synchronize the network on an approximate synchronous evolution obeying ( [ is ] ) , but we were not able to correctly identify the time evolutions of the @xmath8 s . in what follows , we give an explanation for this finding .",
    "our explanation is that , when the @xmath14 are not large enough , it is possible to obtain approximate ( _ not _ exact ) synchronization for a range of values of the @xmath213 .",
    "although this synchronization is not exact , it is still good enough to imply that the minimum of the potential @xmath39 is so broad as to make our procedure ineffective . to illustrate this ,",
    "assume the network systems evolve synchronously , i.e. , @xmath214 , and that the function @xmath215 and @xmath216 are infinitely differentiable .",
    "expanding @xmath217 in a mac - laurin series in the parameter @xmath14 , we have @xmath218 if this expansion of the function @xmath219 has a finite radius of convergence , then ( [ expans ] ) is valid under the assumption that @xmath14 is small enough .",
    "our strategy seeks to minimize the potential @xmath39 at each node @xmath0 , where @xmath39 may be thought of as a sliding average of the mean squared synchronization error at node @xmath0 , and the synchronization error is @xmath220 assuming @xmath221 for all @xmath0 and @xmath2 and making use of ( [ expans ] ) , we obtain @xmath222   { \\tau_{ij}}^{n }   \\label{app3}\\ ] ] by construction , the @xmath37 change slowly with time ( on the time scale @xmath41 ) , as do the @xmath8 ( on the time scale @xmath71 ) . on the other hand , @xmath216 , and hence @xmath223 change rapidly with time .",
    "thus to make the sliding average of @xmath224 as small as possible , we need @xmath225 giving zero for the sliding average .",
    "however , if @xmath148 is large and the @xmath14 are not too big , we can achieve values of @xmath39 that are very small , even if ( [ aa ] ) is far from being satisfied . to see this",
    "we note that if the delays @xmath14 are too small , for some sufficiently large @xmath4 , say @xmath226 , the summation over @xmath4 may be truncated with only a small resulting error in @xmath227 . assuming this to have been done , and setting each term in the sum over @xmath4 in ( [ app3 ] ) equal to zero for each @xmath228",
    ", we obtain @xmath229 equations for the @xmath185 unknowns @xmath17 .",
    "if the number of unknowns is greater than @xmath230 , then we can satisfy all the @xmath230 equations for a continuum of @xmath17 values not satisfying ( [ aa ] ) , and the potential @xmath39 will then be near zero .",
