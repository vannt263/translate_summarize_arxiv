    "in the early 1960 s , fulde and ferrell  @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite proposed the possibility that a superconducting state with a periodic spatial variation of the order parameter would become stable when a singlet superconductor is subject to a large zeeman splitting . the zeeman splitting could be due to either a strong magnetic field or an internal exchange field .",
    "under such a strong magnetic or exchange field , there is a splitting of the fermi surfaces of spin - up and -down electrons , and condensed pairs of electrons with opposite spins across the fermi surface may be formed to lower the free energy from that of a normal spin - polarized state .",
    "these pairs have a non - zero total momentum 2*q * , which causes the phase of the superconducting order parameter to vary spatially with the wave number 2*q*. this state is known as the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state .",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) , on the other hand , proposed independently an alternative scenario , in which the order parameter is real , but varies periodically in space , possibly in more than one directions .",
    "both types of states are now known ( collectively ) as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state . it has not yet been observed in conventional low-@xmath7 @xmath2-wave superconductors , which are mostly three - dimensional , probably because the orbital effect of the magnetic field dominates the zeeman effect .",
    "the situation has been changed by experimental results suggestive of the fflo state in heavy - fermion , quasi-1d organic , or high-@xmath7 superconductors ;  @xcite many of these compounds are quasi - one or two - dimensional , thus the orbital effect is weak when the magnetic field is in the conducting plane or along the chain .",
    "recent experimental results in cecoin@xmath0 , a quasi-2d @xmath1-wave superconductor , are particularly encouraging .",
    "@xcite we note in passing that this subject is also of interest to the nuclear and particle physics communities because of the possible realization of the fflo state in high density quark matter and nuclear matter ,  @xcite as well as in cold fermionic atom systems.@xcite    the most unambiguous evidence of the fflo states should be based on phase - sensitive experiments that can directly reveal the spatial variation of the phase or sign of the order parameter .",
    "one possibility is the josephson effect .",
    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge there has been no report on this or other phase sensitive measurements thus far . in this paper , we consider an alternative phase sensitive probe , i.e. , the conductance spectroscopy through a micro - constriction .",
    "a powerful method to calculate the differential conductance [ @xmath8 characteristics of a normal metal / superconductor junction ( nsj ) was developed by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk  @xcite , which unified quasiparticle tunneling and andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "only @xmath2-wave superconductors were considered in that work , but the method has since been generalized to the @xmath1-wave case .",
    "@xcite when the sign of the order parameter experienced by the electron- and hole - like quasiparticles ( qps ) before and after specular reflection at the junction interface changes , zero - energy andreev bound states ( abss ) ( also called the midgap states  @xcite ) are formed at the s side of the n / s interface ( for @xmath9 ) .",
    "these abss will give rise to a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in the tunneling spectrum of the nsj .",
    "a well known example of such nsj is when the junction interface along the nodal line of the @xmath3-wave superconductor [ ( 110 ) contact ] .",
    "@xcite this feature has since been widely used to identify the order - parameter symmetry of unconventional superconductors .  @xcite we would like to emphasize here that the abss are consequences of the phase change of the @xmath1-wave order parameter  @xcite , and thus their spectra should also be sensitive to the spatial variation of the order parameter . in this paper",
    ", we will show this sensitivity by explicit calculations , and from their spectra detected via conductance spectroscopy through a micro - constriction , one can extract the momentum of the superconducting order parameter . in the present work ,",
    "we will focus on the ff state ; the more general lo cases are currently being investigated and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite as we will show below , for a @xmath3-wave superconductor in the ff state , the zbcp observed in a ( 110 ) contact is split and shifted by both the zeeman field and pair momentum ; the latter can be determined from the splitting .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and present the self - consistent mean - field solutions for both @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave superconductors in the ff phases . the electron density of states ( dos ) of the ff states is also obtained .",
    "the scheme to calculate the conductance characteristics is presented in section iii , with numerical results for both @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave cases , and their relation with the corresponding bulk electron dos is discussed .",
    "the features associated with the abss in the ff phase are explored in section iv , where we solve their spectra in the ff state .",
    "we present further discussion on our results and a summary in section v. in this work , we consider zero temperature only , and calculations on @xmath1-wave superconductors are simply referred to @xmath3-wave .",
    "we begin with the mean field hamiltonian for a 2d superconductor in the bcs state ( @xmath10 ) or the ff state ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the single - particle kinetic energy relative to the fermi energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the zeeman magnetic field , @xmath16 is the magnetic moment of the electron , @xmath17 is the pairing potential and satisfies the self - consistent condition , @xmath18 for @xmath2-wave , we have @xmath19 , while for @xmath1-wave , we have @xmath20 ( here , @xmath21 is the cutoff , @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle of * k * ) .",
    "the orbital coupling between the magnetic field and electron motion is absent when the field is in the plane .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian could be rewritten as @xmath23 where @xmath24 to diagonalize it , we perform the bogoliubov - valatin transformation @xmath25 and choose @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , from which we get the diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath30 with eigenenergies ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 there are regions in the * k*-space where the cooper pairs are destroyed and occupied by electrons of one spin species ; these are states with @xmath33 . in these cases the bogoliubov - valatin transformation ( eq .  ( [ eq : qptrans1 ] ) ) should be replaced by @xmath34 when @xmath35 , or @xmath36 when @xmath37 .",

    "the calculation of the self - consistent pairing potential shows that the superconducting state is destroyed at @xmath47 for @xmath2-wave  @xcite and at @xmath48 for @xmath1-wave .",
    "@xcite in the superconducting regime , for @xmath2-wave case , at @xmath49 , a transition occurs and the ff state becomes the ground state . for @xmath1-wave case ,",
    "the critical zeeman field is @xmath50 where an ff phase occurs with * q * along the nodal direction . at a higher @xmath51 , the ff state with * q * along the antinodal direction dominates .",
    "@xcite the critical fields @xmath52 are slightly smaller than the clogston - chandrasekhar fields which is @xmath53 for @xmath2-wave  @xcite , and @xmath54 for @xmath1-wave  @xcite ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the qualitative illustrations of the phase diagrams are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] and [ fig : phase2 ] .",
    "the finite momentum of the order parameter leads to a nonzero supercurrent in the ground state .",
    "however , the supercurrent is expected to be compensated by the backflow of the quasiparticle current , and therefore , we have a zero total current .",
    "@xcite here we demonstrate that the total current is indeed zero for the self - consistent mean - field ground state .",
    "the total current operator can be written as @xmath55 and in the superconducting state , its expectation value is @xmath56 by differentiate eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffenergy ] ) at fixed @xmath57 we can verify that @xmath58 since @xmath59 is minimized in the @xmath60 space , the current must be zero",
    ".    the electron dos can be evaluated using @xmath61 within the approximation of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , it can be seen that for an arbitrary state * k * , there is always another state @xmath64 with @xmath65 , so that both states have the same energy , and their weighting factors in eq .",

    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : dos0 ] ) can be simplified to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dos of the normal state at the fermi level .",

    "the bdg equations have the special solutions of the form , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 obey the andreev equations    [ eq : andreev ] @xmath83    where @xmath84 . the eigenenergy @xmath85 is symmetric about @xmath86 instead of zero as in ref .  .",
    "these equations are similar to those of ref . , where the authors studied conductance characteristics in the presence of a supercurrent along the junction ( note that the @xmath87 in ref .",
    "is equal to @xmath88 of this work ) . following the method of blonder - tinkham - klapwijk  @xcite , the normalized tunneling conductance at zero temperature is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the tunneling conductances in the superconducting and normal states , respectively .",
    "since the qps of the two spin species are uncoupled , the conductance will simply be the average over the two spin components : @xmath92 and the same for @xmath91 .",
    "for simplicity , we will drop the spin index when there is no ambiguity .",

    "note that the zeeman splitting for the @xmath2-wave case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : btk - non](a ) reproduces the well - known results reviewed in ref .   and the @xmath5 results given in ref .",
    "we start our discussion with an @xmath2-wave superconductor or a @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 100 ) contact , where there are no abss ; thus the conductances are determined by the bulk quasiparticles .",
    "we note that , in the arrangement considered here , due to the effect of pair momentum , the conductance curves at large @xmath4 seem to no longer coincide with the corresponding electron dos for either case .",
    "[ compare figs  [ fig : btk - s](c ) , [ fig : btk - d1](c ) , and [ fig : btk - d2](c ) with figs .",
    "[ fig : dos1 ]  ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . ] at first sight , this appears to be against our intuitive understanding of what the nsj conductance at high - barrier limit ( tunneling limit ) is supposed to be measuring ; we now resolve this issue below .    in the arrangement of nsjs considered here ,",
    "the applied voltage and the measured current are both along a fixed direction in the conducting plane that is normal to the n / s interface .",
    "thus we realize that the junction conductance in the high - barrier - strength limit is actually measuring a @xmath105-weighted dos .",
    "that is , the qps of various momenta @xmath106 on the 2d fermi surface ( i.e. , circle ) do not all make equal contributions to the junction conductance , but should be weighted by @xmath105 where @xmath99 is the angle between @xmath106 and the current direction @xmath107 .",
    "the weighted dos [ @xmath108 measured in the high-@xmath4-limit junction conductance is therefore : @xmath109 in the uniform bcs state ( without involving abss ) , such weighted average simply returns to the original dos , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dos2 ] ) is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : dos1 ] ) in the cases studied here .",
    "this is because the order parameter is isotropic over the momentum space for an @xmath2-wave superconductor , while for an n/(@xmath1-wave superconductor ) junction with ( 100 ) contact , the order parameter is symmetric about @xmath110 so that the partial dos of a fixed direction is also symmetric about the same line . because the @xmath105 weighting factor adds up to be 1 for two angles that are symmetric about this line",
    ", we thus have the weighted dos by high-@xmath4 junction conductance to be again the same as the un - weighted dos .",
    "@xcite however , the situation is very different in the ff state , because this kind of symmetry is broken by the pair momentum which causes a @xmath99-dependent energy shift , thus the two kinds of dos are no longer the same .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos2 ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the high-@xmath4 junction conductance measures the @xmath105-weighted dos , and not the un - weighted dos in general .",
    "( the slight discrepancy between the tunneling conductance and the weighted dos is because @xmath104 is still not high enough . )",
    "the most prominent features of the high-@xmath4 junction conductance of an n/(@xmath1-wave ff superconductor ) with ( 110 ) contact are due to the abss , which are the main focus of the present work .",
    "to interpret these features we need to understand how the pair momentum affects the spectra of the abss , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "as has been reviewed in the introduction , for an n/(@xmath1-wave superconductor ) junction with ( 110 ) contact , a zbcp is expected due to the formation of the `` zero energy andreev bound states '' ( or `` midgap states '' ) at the junction interface .",
    "thus for an n/(@xmath1-wave superconductor in an ff state ) junction with ( 110 ) contact and * q * along ( @xmath111 ) , we need to understand the effects of @xmath112 and * q * on the spectra of abss before we can understand the conductance characteristics for this junction .    in the limit of @xmath113",
    "we can consider a simple model with an ff superconductor in the region @xmath114 , and vacuum or an insulator in the region @xmath115 , with * q * parallel to the n / s interface . in the superconductor region , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : andreev ] ) , we can find the solutions of bound states ( which decays to zero as @xmath116 ) to be of the form , @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) . in order to satisfy the vanishing wave - function boundary condition at @xmath76",
    ", we need to first superpose the above solutions of opposite @xmath122 : @xmath123 imposing the vanishing boundary condition at @xmath76 then yields @xmath124    for an @xmath2-wave superconductor , and for a @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 100 ) contact , eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundbc ] ) yields no abss solutions . for a @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 110 ) contact , we obtain one solution for each @xmath125 at @xmath126 or @xmath127 we see that the energies of the abss are first split by the zeeman energy to @xmath128 and then , shifted by an amount proportional to both the pair momentum * q * and the sine of the incident angle @xmath99 ( which ranges between @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) ; the combined results of them will lead to a splitting , shifting , and broadening of the zbcp , which we now analyze . with ( 110 ) contact ,",
    "the order parameter is proportional to @xmath131 , which vanishes at @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , implying that near these special values there are either no abss , or their contributions to conductance will be very weak because these are very loosely bound states ; the dominant contributions come from abss with @xmath99 around @xmath134 ( or around gap maxima ) ; the energy shift of these states due to pair momenta are in _ opposite _ direction when the sign of @xmath99 are different .",
    "thus for sufficiently large @xmath135 , which is the case here , the junction conductance at positive bias should exhibit two peaks , one on each side of @xmath112 , and a dip at the zeeman field energy @xmath136 .",
    "( the conductance has a symmetry about zero bias in the approximation adopted here , so we do not need to consider negative bias . ) for the two peaks , the one on the right side ( @xmath137 ) arises from @xmath138 , whereas the one on the left side ( @xmath139 ) arises from @xmath140 . if only spin - up qps are considered , the two peaks are of equal strength and equal distance from the dip as illustrated in the dashed line of fig .  [",
    "fig : spin](c ) . when the contributions from the qps of both spin species are summed up",
    ", the two peaks will not be symmetric about the dip ( @xmath139 will be shifted slightly to the right , but the influence on @xmath137 and the dip is negligible ) , and a weak peak at zero bias emerges ( see fig .  [ fig : spin](c ) ) . to locate the position of the peak @xmath137 , we first notice from eqs .",
    "[ eq : g1][eq : g3 ] that the bias voltage difference between the peak and the dip , @xmath141 , should be a function of @xmath142 in the high-@xmath4 limit and vanishes when the pair momentum is zero .",
    "numerically , therefore we can consider a simplified situation where there exists the pair momentum without zeeman field ( such in ref .  ) and calculate this difference as a function of the pair momentum .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peak ] . by fitting the data to a straight line through the origin ,",
    "we obtain @xmath143 thus , by measuring the bias voltages of the peak and the dip in the high-@xmath4 junction conductance with ( 110 ) contact , and in particular the difference between them , we can obtain a good estimate of * q*. we note that without this pair momentum , we would have all abss at energies @xmath144 , which would have given rise to one sharp peak only at @xmath145 in the same conductance plot , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : btk - non](b ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that the signature of the ff state is clearly revealed in the junction conductance characteristics , especially at high @xmath4 , but the conductance behaviors at low @xmath4 for all three cases studied here are also quite novel , since they are quite different from the corresponding results for uniform @xmath2- or @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "in this paper we have studied the conductance characteristics of a junction between a normal metal and a superconductor in the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state , using the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk formalism . we have studied both @xmath2- and @xmath1-wave cases , and for the latter case , we considered junctions along both the nodal [ ( 110 ) ] and antinodal [ ( 100 ) ] directions .",
    "the conductance characteristics of a micro - constriction is presumably easiest to understand in the high tunneling - barrier limit , when the conductance should give information about dos of the superconductor . in the ff phase ,",
    "the zeeman field should split the contributions to the conductance by the spin - up and -down qps , i.e. , shifting their contributions by the zeeman energy in opposite directions .",
    "in addition , for qps of either spin species , their contributions should be shifted by an amount proportional to the pair momentum , with a proportionality constant depending on the cosine of the angle between its kinetic momentum and the pair momentum .",
    "this proportionality constant can range from a negative maximum to a positive maximum .",
    "thus we found the effect of * q * to be a broadening rather than a shift .",
    "one would expect similar effects to occur on the contributions by the abss , resulting in the shift and broadening of the zbcp .",
    "thus , in the high - barrier - limit , one might ( naively ) expect the tunneling spectrum of @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 110 ) contact to be composed of broadened zbcp s centered around @xmath146 . in our numerical results",
    ", we find instead that the high - barrier - limit tunneling conductance of @xmath1-wave superconductors with ( 110 ) contact has a _ dip _ at the zeeman energy , with one round peak on each side of it , and also another weak peak at exactly zero energy .",
    "this is quite different from the situation of the bcs state in the presence of a zeeman field , in which case one expects the _ sharp _ zbcp to be shifted to @xmath146 , as well as the naive expectation above .",
    "the dip and the two round peaks can be understood as due to the fact that the * q * values appearing here are so large that they are already beyond the critical value obtained in ref .  , which studied directly the current effect on the conductance characteristics in the absence of a zeeman field .",
    "for such large * q * values , their effect on the zbcp in the high - barrier - limit tunneling conductance is to split the zbcp into two round peaks with a center dip .",
    "it is worth noting that such high values of * q * are not accessible through direct application of a supercurrent .",
    "the weak peak at zero energy turns out to be the result of summing up spin - up and -down contributions .",
    "furthermore , numerical analysis shows that the bias voltage difference between the dip and the round peak on its right side is proportional to the pair momentum and thus gives us a simple way to estimate the pair momentum for @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 110 ) contact .    for @xmath2-wave superconductor and @xmath1-wave superconductor with ( 100 ) contact",
    ", there is no abs and the conductance is due to contributions from bulk quasiparticles exclusively . in these cases",
    "we have also found conductance features in the ff superconductors that are very different from the bcs superconductors .",
    "we found that because of the energy shift due to the pair momentum ( which breaks the spatial symmetries in the original system ) , the conductance in the high barrier limit is no longer the same as the electron dos ; instead , it reflects a _ directionally - weighted _ dos . in principle , by comparing the conductance and the bulk dos  @xcite that are measured by other means ( such as tunneling along the @xmath147-direction instead of an in - plane direction discussed here ) , one can also distinguish between bcs and ff states .",
