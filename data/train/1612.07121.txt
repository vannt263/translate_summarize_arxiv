    "<S> the fact that real and virtual phonon processes occur on separate temperature scales is of vital importance to the development of solid - state single photons sources . </S>",
    "<S> although the phonon sideband is a persistent problem at low temperatures , it may be easily removed through spectral filtering , or use of a high q - cavity  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the broadening of the zpl can not be removed through simple filtering , instead one must rely on purcell enhancement to reduce its influence . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sensitivity of virtual phonon processes to temperature will place significant limitations on the operating regimes of qd systems .    in summary , through temperature dependent tpi measurements , we have demonstrated that both real and virtual phonon transitions play a role in reducing the indistinguishability of photons emitted from qds under resonant excitation . </S>",
