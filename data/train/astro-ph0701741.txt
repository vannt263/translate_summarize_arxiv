    "the effect on star formation of an environment dominated by high mass stars is still an unresolved problem of astrophysics .",
    "strong stellar winds from high mass o- , and b - type stars can trigger star formation by compressing and the interstellar material , which eventually becomes gravitationally unstable @xcite . also photoevaporation can heat the surface of an interstellar cloud and lead to a radiatively driven implosion , thus playing a similarly ( if not more ) important role in triggering star formation in this environment @xcite . on the other hand the strong extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from the same hot stars",
    "might so vigorously photoevaporate the material around the forming stars that it truncates the star formation process",
    ". a better understanding of the photoevaporation of circumstellar material would therefore be an important step toward clarifying the overall effects of hot stars upon the process of star formation .",
    "the discovery of `` proplyds '' in orion and other high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these studies have shown that the outer parts of disks evaporate quickly , producing structures that match the appearance of the proplyds well .",
    "@xcite presented a model for the photoevaporation of circumstellar disks by an external source of uv radiation .",
    "they applied this model to @xmath1 ori c and concluded that circumstellar disks are rapidly destroyed by the external uv radiation field . excluding viscosity effects ,",
    "they predict final disk sizes of @xmath2 au , at distances within 0.3 pc of the illuminating source and reached about 1 million years after the onset of the uv illumination of the disk . a number of other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict similar ( or shorter ) timescales but differ regarding the extent of the disk erosion .",
    "infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) observations of high mass star forming regions are perfect tools for testing these theories .",

    "observations of ngc2244 were obtained on 2004 march 09 with irac @xcite .",
    "the irac survey covers about half a square degree centered on the main ob core .",
    "the 12s high - dynamic - range mode was used to obtain two frames in each position , one with 0.4s exposure time and one with 10.4s .",
    "the observation of each field was repeated twice with a small offset that allowed 20.8s integration time for each pixel .",

    "the calibration was done by using large aperture measurements of standard star observations .",
    "the zero point magnitudes of the calibration were 19.6600 , 18.9440 , 16.8810 , and 17.3940 for channel 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 respectively .",

    "the detected sources were examined visually in each channel to clean the sample of non - stellar objects and false detections around bright stars .",

    "it has a class ii object at the tip , and there are a class i and several class ii sources to the west of this formation ( figure [ fig : globcrop ] right panel ) .",
    "this object has a linear size of 2.2 pc which is very similar to the largest of the `` pillars of creation '' in m16 @xcite .",
    "the young stellar objects ( ysos ) can be characterized by their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite .",
    "based on the sed we can distinguish 4 main types of ysos : class 0 , i , ii , iii .",
    "the class 0/i objects are deeply embedded and their seds peak in the submillimeter or the far infrared indicating that the source of the emission is cold dust .",
    "the class ii sources are optically visible stars with infrared excess emission that is attributed to a disk surrounding the central object .",
    "class iii sources have almost no infrared excess and their photometric properties are very similar to normal main - sequence stars .",
    "we can use a mid - infrared two - color diagram to distinguish between class i , ii and iii objects .",
    "we identify 337 class ii and 25 class i sources in the irac two color ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] ) diagram using the method described by @xcite ( figure [ fig : iraccolor ] ) .",
    "there are also 14 sources with uncertain evolutionary status ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath11 0.4 and [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] @xmath9 1.1 ) . for them ,",
    "the large value of the [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] color suggests class i status while the small [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color would indicate a class ii source .",

    "we double checked our classifications using other color - color and color - magnitude diagrams like j - h vs k-[24 ] or j - h vs h - k from the 2mass data . in each diagram",
    "the class ii and class i sources occupy the regimes predicted by model calculations or by observations of other class ii / i sources .",
    "another method of identifying stars with infrared excess ( class i or class ii sources ) is to combine mips and irac photometry ( figure [ fig : mipscolor ] ) .",
    "this method should be more robust than the previous one because reddening hardly affects the 24 @xmath0 m observations . also , the separation of stars with different evolutionary status is larger on the combined irac - mips two color diagram .",
    "however the 24@xmath0 m observations are less sensitive and so not as complete as the irac - only sample . using the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 8]-[24 ] color - color diagram and the color criteria defined by muzerolle et al .",
    "( in preparation ) we found 20 class i and 213 class ii sources out of 279 24@xmath0 m sources detected in the region covered by both irac and mips observations .",
    "we note that there are some cases where sources identified as class i on the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 8.0]-[24 ] plots are classified as class ii sources on the irac two color diagram and vice versa .",
    "this indicates that the adopted boundary between class i and class ii sources is uncertain and introduces some ambiguity in distinguishing the two types definitively based on their infrared colors .",
    "where the source showed class ii nature on the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 8.0]-[24 ] diagram but class i or class i / ii on the irac color - color diagram , we classified it as class ii because these objects are probably highly reddened class ii sources . adding these sources to the irac class ii sample",
    "would modify our results to 362 class ii sources and 12 class i sources .",
    "a small number of young stars might be misidentified background planetary nebulae or agb stars or galaxies .",
    "the effects of these contaminations are usually small @xcite .",
    "the method of gutermuth et al .",
    "( in preparation ) uses different color - color and color - magnitude diagrams to estimate the number of contaminating sources .",
    "it shows that the number of sources that might be agn or pah emitting galaxies is below 1% .",
    "it is also possible that a 24@xmath0 m source invisible at shorter wavelengths is projected onto a pure irac class ii source confusing the classification methods .",
    "this configuration might appear as a class i object showing a large excess at 24@xmath0 m on the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 8.0]-[24 ] plot while on the irac two color diagram it seems to be a normal class ii object .",
    "the probability of such an event is extremely low ( p @xmath11 10@xmath12 ) .",
    "chance coincidences with background 24 @xmath0m - emitting galaxies are also possible , but unlikely in the relevant flux density range for class i sources , given typical galaxy number counts @xcite and our flux limits .",
    "we show the 24 @xmath0 m image with the class ii and i sources and the o stars overlaid in fig [ fig : ds9 ] . the class ii sources are concentrated mainly in the ob core .",
    "we used smoothed stellar density contours to determine the center of the class ii population ( figure [ fig : dens ] ) .",
    "our calculation shows that the center of the concentration of class ii sources is at ra=6@xmath1331@xmath1458@xmath15 dec=4@xmath1654@xmath1751@xmath18 ( just southwest from the main 24 @xmath0 m emission peak ) , which is in very good agreement with the coordinate of the center of the cluster derived from 2mass data by @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : disthist ] shows the number of stars vs their projected distance to the closest o star in equal area ( 0.8 @xmath19 ) bins .",
    "the hollow histogram represents stars without excess while the filled histogram represents class ii sources .",
    "the right panel of the same figure shows the fraction of stars with excess vs their distance to the closest o star .",
    "given that the infrared excess is generally attributed to radiation from a circumstellar disk , we consider each excess source a star with disk .",
    "there is an excess of sources without disks in the first distance bin ( 42 without disk vs 16 with disk ) very close ( d @xmath11 0.5 pc ) to the nearest o star . in the other bins the disk ratio seems to maintain a constant level . the number of non - disk stars as a function of projected distance from the nearest o star as shown in the left panel of figure 9 , levels off around 2.5 - 3.0 parsec",
    "this suggests that the stars outside this radius are probably non - members and belong to the foreground or background population .",
    "we can divide our data into three subsamples : 1 . ) the first bin very close to the o stars , 2 . ) between 0.5 and 2.5 pc from the o stars where the population of the cluster is significant ; and 3 . )",
    "farther than 2.5 pc from the o stars where the background and foreground population takes over .",
    "we subtracted the average background population ( 1 source / bin in the disk and 3 sources / bin in the non - disk population ) from each bin and calculated the disk ratio in the two other regions .",
    "the disk ratio is about 27% if the distance from an o star is less than 0.5 pc . in the remaining region where the cluster population is significant",
    "the disk ratio is about 45.4% @xmath20 6% .",
    "the overall disk fraction in the cluster is 44.5% .",
    "this is somewhat smaller but in reasonable agreement with the results of @xcite , who found a typical disk fraction @xmath2150% for 3 myr - old regions using k - l excess as an indicator of circumstellar disks .",
    "@xcite found the same disk fraction at 3 million years using n - band excesses .",
    "the bin to bin fluctuation is on the order of 5 - 10% in agreement with the average statistical error of the disk ratio .",
    "the small variation with radius indicates that the disk fraction is not correlated with the distance from the o stars outside a certain distance .",
    "however , close to the o stars we observe a drop of the disk fraction . to calculate the significance of this drop , we used the binomial theorem .",
    "we assumed that the sources close to and far away from the o - stars were drawn from the same parental distribution , that is , that the average proportion of disks was the same in both samples and that the apparent difference was due to statistical fluctuations distributed as in the binomial distribution .",
    "we adjusted the common value of the average to maximize the probability , and found that there was less than a 2the o stars having the same intrinsic average proportion of disks as for the far region .",
    "this behavior may be consistent with the model calculations of @xcite showing that a disk can be destroyed in a couple of million years if it gets too close ( @xmath11 0.3pc ) to an o6 star .",
    "however , there is only a trend against disks near the o stars , not a complete lack of them .",
    "four out of five o stars in our field have at least one confirmed class ii source within this radius , including the two highest mass o stars , hd46223 ( o5 ) and hd46150 ( o6 ) . altogether we see eight class ii sources within a projected radius of 0.3 pc from one of the five o stars . including the photoevaporating disk candidate mentioned in section 3.1 , we see a net of nine class ii sources in the close vicinity of an o star .",
    "we examined the possibility that these sources just seem to be close to the o stars and actually are in front of or behind them outside the 0.3 pc radius .",
    "we performed a simple monte carlo simulation placing 5 o stars and 362 class ii sources in a sphere with a radius of 6.5 pc and counted the class ii stars that were inside the 0.3 pc projected radius of any o star . after repeating the experiment 100000 times , to get accurate statistics",
    ", we found the most probable number of false companions is 3 or less ( more than 50% of all the cases ) .",
    "the probability of seeing 8 or more fake companions is under 3% .",
    "we repeated the calculations using a 0.5 pc radius to reduce the effect of low number statistics and to compare our calculation with the results shown on figure [ fig : disthist ] .",
    "in ngc  2244 we see 16 class ii sources within a 0.5 pc radius of an o star . in this case",
    "our experiment shows that the most probable number of chance alignments is 9 .",
    "the probability of seeing 16 or more stars in this region is about 4% .    given the results of the simulations we can rule out the possibility that all of our class ii sources are outside the radius of influence of the o star and are only chance alignments . to explain the presence of class ii sources we consider the scenario that the low mass star is just passing by the o star and recently entered the `` danger zone '' , making the infrared excess a short lived phenomenon .",
    "in this case , given the average velocity dispersion in the cluster ( @xmath2110km / s , @xcite or 6.8 km / s , @xcite ) and assuming radial orbits , a low mass star would spend approximately @xmath22 yr in the vicinity of the o star as it passes .",
    "( the sample of @xcite contains only 3 stars while the sample of @xcite contains only 8 stars with sensible radial velocities , which makes the radial velocity dispersion rather uncertain . ) models by @xcite predict that this circumstance will expose a large amount of dust that is entrained in the evaporating gas , leading to bright ir emission .",
    "the orion proplyds @xcite are examples , and figure [ fig : strangesource ] shows a similar object in ngc  2244 .",
    "they can be identified in mips images by long `` cometary '' tails of warm dust as the photon pressure ejects the grains from the vicinity of the hot stars .    although the majority of the class ii sources in the vicinity of the o and b stars do not have the expected morphology they might still be `` cometary '' sources seen head on or tail on .",
    "the modeling of the object in figure [ fig : strangesource ] shows that its tail lies nearly on the plane of the sky @xcite . at the distance of ngc  2244 about 3 - 5 out of 6 such sources",
    "would be unresolved with mips given the 6  beam size and assuming a random distribution of tail orientations .",
    "to sum it up , chance alignments ( @xmath219@xmath201 ) and short lived unresolved cometary structures ( @xmath2111@xmath203 ) would account for most of the class ii sources very close to the o stars ( d @xmath11 0.5 ) .",
    "the drop in the portion of class ii sources also suggests the presence of some objects with truncated disks .    outside a certain radius ( 0.5 pc in our case )",
    "the disk fraction does not seem to depend on the distance from the o stars .",
    "the change in disk properties near 0.5 pc may let us test models of photoevaporation .",
    "for this regime we can consider the limiting case of the disks being long - lived . in the current photoevaporating models",
    "the behavior of the inner zones ( within 50 au of the central star ) differs substantially among the studies .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated that the disks evaporate quickly down to a radius of about 20 au , and thereafter more slowly to one of about 2 au .",
    "they argue that effects of viscosity not included in the calculations would probably result in complete destruction of the disks .",
    "the calculations of @xcite generally show the evaporation slowing substantially in the 50 to 100 au region ( but they only follow the evolution to 10@xmath23 years ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculate that the evaporation slows substantially at a radius of 5 to 10 au , requiring 10@xmath23 years in the latter case and slightly longer in the former .",
    "the models of @xcite require a few times 10@xmath23 years to evaporate to a limiting radius of about 2 au .    some studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derive a power law relation between the photoevaporation rate and the distance from the o star ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the exponent of this function ( @xmath25 ) is in the range of about 0.7 and 1.2 .",
    "these quantitative predictions are amenable to test with our observations .",
    "to estimate the effect of photoevaporation on the disk fraction and to see which slope is most probable in the case of ngc2244 , we performed a monte carlo simulation .",
    "similar to the previous case where we examined the probability of chance alignments , we scattered 5 o stars in the volume of ngc2244 .",
    "then we let a star with the disk randomly walk among the o stars with a velocity of 10 km / s .",
    "we randomly assigned an initial disk mass between 0.001 and 0.1 m@xmath10 to the source based on the study of @xcite , who found that the distribution of disk masses in a similar mass range probed by our observations is roughly equal and independent of stellar mass .",
    "we calculated the photoevaporation rate in every 0.05 pc step based on the distance from the nearest star and the photoevaporation rate - distance relation of @xcite ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "they consider cases that yield @xmath25=0.767 or @xmath25=1.134 ; we therefore have let @xmath25 vary between these values .",
    "the output of our simulation was the total mass loss and the difference between the lost mass and the initial disk mass after 3 million years .",
    "if the latter was less than zero we considered the disk totally evaporated .",
    "this very simple model does not take into account that the photoevaporation may slow down after reaching a certain radius @xcite and also ignores the effect of gravity ( when we calculate the trajectory of the stars ) , the cumulative effect of more than one o star s radiation field and the central star s own uv radiation field .",
    "other than the first , the ignored effects would speed up the photoevaporation , so our calculated disk survival rates are upper limits ( unless in fact photoevaporation slows at some radius @xmath27 a few au ) .    to get reasonable statistics we ran the simulation 10000 times for the same o star configuration changing the initial mass of the disk and the initial position of the disk - bearing star .",
    "then we repeated the experiment several times for different o star configurations .",
    "we also considered two extreme cases : 1 . )",
    "the disk - bearing stars could freely leave the cluster ; and 2 . )",
    "the disk - bearing stars bounce back from the cluster boundaries .",
    "we found that the difference between the two cases is within the error of our simulations , which is on the order of 2 - 3% .",
    "given the fact that the velocity dispersions of @xcite and @xcite are very uncertain and much larger than the virial velocity ( @xmath21 1 km / s ) of the cluster , we repeated the experiment using the velocity dispersion of 2 km / s measured in the orion nebula cluster @xcite . the effect of this velocity change on the disk survival ( @xmath211% for each slope we studied ) is smaller than our errors so we use our original values in the following .",
    "assuming that a 3 million year old cluster without o stars has a disk fraction around 50% @xcite , we found that the value of @xmath28 suggested by @xcite resulted in too few surviving disk ( 5% ) .",
    "as we make the slope steeper we see that the disk fraction initially rapidly rises ( 36% with @xmath29 ) , and then the rise slows down giving a disk fraction of 41% at @xmath30 . in spite of the weaknesses of our simple model",
    ", we can clearly conclude that the data favor the steeper slope ( @xmath31 ) in the photoevaporation rate vs distance relation .",
    "together with the small difference ( @xmath11 10% ) between the disk fraction of clusters with and without o stars and the fact that the disk fraction is constant outside a certain radius from the o stars , our lower limit @xmath31 indicates that the effect of high mass stars is significant only in their immediate vicinity ( @xmath32 pc ) .",
    "many of the class i sources are located around the rims of the surrounding nebula , which might indicate self - propagating star formation triggered by the expanding shell driven by ob stars in the core of the cluster . however some class i sources appear to be in the evacuated region around the o stars .",
    "it is possible that some of these sources are only projected onto the cavity and actually they are located behind it .",
    "if we consider a configuration in which the shape of the interface between the denser gas and the evacuated region is a half - sphere behind the cluster and the sources are evenly distributed on this interface , we find that projection can account for all of the sources apparently in the evacuated region .    the fact that probably all class i sources are close to their birthplaces , the interface between ngc2244 and the surrounding gas , suggests that these objects are really much younger than the class ii sources that are spread throughout the whole cluster . on the other hand class",
    "i sources represent a group of stars formed by triggered star formation so there might be young class ii sources associated with them .",
    "further observations are needed to study this problem in more detail .",
    "the ratio of class i / class ii sources is about 7% in the irac - mips sample and 3% in the pure irac sample .",
    "both ratios are much lower than similar ratios ( @xmath320% ) in low - mass star forming regions such as taurus and ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that the star formation activity in the immediate vicinity of ngc  2244 is coming to an end . on the other hand the position of the class",
    "i sources implies that star formation is still ongoing outside the evacuated region .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of @xcite who found that sequential formation is taking place in the ambient molecular cloud .",
    "we have conducted an infrared imaging survey at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 and 24@xmath0 m of about 0.4 square degrees centered on the main ob core of ngc  2244 .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of our photometry are 17.0 , 16.4 , 14.2 , 13.6 and 10.7 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 and 24@xmath0 m respectively . from the analysis of the images and the photometry we conclude the following .",
    "* there is a strong 24 @xmath0 m feature in the middle of the main ob core of ngc  2244 .",
    "it has bowshock - like geometry probably shaped by the stellar wind of the nearby o and b stars interacting with the cool dust in the neighborhood .",
    "* we identify 337 class ii sources and 25 class i sources on the irac two color diagrams and 213 class ii and 20 class i sources using the irac datasets combined with 24 @xmath0 m observations . * in both samples the class i / class ii ratio is much lower than similar ratios in low - mass star - forming regions , implying that the star formation activity in the immediate vicinity of ngc2244 is coming to an end . *",
    "the center of concentration of the class ii sources shows very good agreement with the coordinate of the center of the cluster derived by @xcite using star - counts from the 2mass database . * using the irac ( and where available mips ) data we find that roughly 44.5% of cluster members have disks , which is somewhat smaller but in reasonably good agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite for clusters with similar age .",
    "* we found 16 class ii sources in the immediate vicinity of o stars .",
    "we can not completely explain this by line - of - sight coincidence ( the most probable number of chance alignments is 9 ) .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that these sources have disks that have not been close long enough to be destroyed by photoevaporation . they might be similar to the sources reported by @xcite but unresolved because the tail is not on the plane of the sky .",
    "about 2/3 of these object ( 10 - 11 in our case ) remain unresolved at 24 @xmath0 m due to the large beamsize of spitzer . *",
    "we calculated the distance of the class ii sources from the nearest o star and from the corrected distribution we conclude that the fraction of stars with disks does not correlate with the distance outside 0.5 pc from the o stars .",
    "however there is a deficit of disks within the 0.5pc radius region . * for disks beyond 0.5pc from the o stars",
    ", we showed that the measured disk fraction favors the steeper slopes ( @xmath31 ) in the photoevaporation rate vs o star distance relation ; that is slopes like the @xmath28 value of @xcite are unlikely in the case of ngc  2244 .",
    "this together with the small difference ( @xmath11 10% ) between the disk fraction of clusters with and without o stars and the fact that the disk fraction is constant outside a certain radius from the o stars , indicates that the effect of high mass stars is significant only in their immediate vicinity ( d @xmath11 0.5 pc ) . * allowing for projection ,",
    "it is likely that all of the identified class i sources are located around the rims of the surrounding nebula .",
    "this indicates that they arise from self - propagating star formation triggered by the expanding shell driven by the high mass stars .",
    "it also implies that the class i objects are extremely young .",
