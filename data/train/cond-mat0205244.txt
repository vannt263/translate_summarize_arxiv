    "real life networks , whether made by nature , ( e.g. neural , metabolic and ecological networks ) @xcite , or made by human ( e.g. the world wide web , power grids , transport networks and social networks of relations between individuals or institutes ) @xcite , have special features which is a blend of those of regular networks on the one hand and completely random ones on the other hand . to study any process in these networks,(the spreading of an epidemic in human society , a virus in the internet , or an electrical power failure in a large city , to name only a few ) ,",
    "an understanding of their topological and connectivity properties is essential ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently obtained data from many real networks show that like random networks @xcite , they have low diameter , and like regular networks , they have high clustering . since the pioneering work of watts and strogatz @xcite , these networks have attracted a lot of attentions and have been studied from various directions @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to most of the models studied so far , many real networks like the world wide web , neural , power grids , metabolic and ecological networks have directed one - way links @xcite .",
    "these types of networks may have significant differences in both their static and dynamic properties with the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model and its variations @xcite .",
    "the presence of directed links affects strongly many of the properties of a network .",
    "for example , for the same pattern of shortcuts , the average shortest path in an directed network is longer than that in an undirected one , due to the presence of bonds with the wrong directions ( blocks ) in many paths .",
    "so is the spreading time of any dynamic effect on the lattice .",
    "+ consider the quantity @xmath0 defined as the average number of sites which are visited at least once when we start a naive spreading process at a site and continue it for @xmath1 steps .",
    "note that we mean an average over an ensemble of networks and initially infected sites and by the naive spreading process we mean that at each step of the spreading process all the neighbors of an infected site are equally infected .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 may be taken as a crude approximation for the number of people who have been infected by a contiguous disease after @xmath1 time steps has elapsed since the first person has been infected .",
    "clearly this is a simplification of the real phenomena , since in real world a disease may not affect an immunized person or may not transmit with certainty in a contact .",
    "however as a first approximation , @xmath0 may give a sensible measure of the effect in the whole network .",
    "since in an directed network , an effect only spreads to those neighbors into which there are correctly directed links , there will be pronounced differences in this important quantity between an directed and an undirected network . as a concrete example consider a ring with @xmath2 sites , without any shortcuts , where to emphasize the absence of shortcuts , we denote @xmath0 by @xmath3 . if all the links have the same direction , we have @xmath4 , and if all of them are bidirectional , we have @xmath5 . in both cases",
    "the whole lattice gets infected after a finite time .",
    "however if the links are randomly directed then @xmath6 may be much lower and furthermore , there is a finite probability that only a small fraction of the whole lattice gets infected .",
    "+ adding shortcuts to this ring of course has a positive effect on the spreading . in a sense",
    "we have a chance to see the interplay of two different concepts of small worlds in these networks .",
    "the size of the world as a whole may be small due to the ease of communication with the remote points provided by long range connections , however the world accessible to an individual may be small due to the absence of properly directed links to connect it to the outside world .",
    "+ it is therefore natural to ask how the presence of directed links and ( or ) directed shortcuts affects quantitatively the small world properties of a network ? how we can make a simple model of a small world network with such random directions",
    "? a ws - type model for these networks may be as shown in figure ( [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "however due to their complexity , these networks should usually be studied by numerical or simulation methods and they seldom amend themselves to exact analytical treatment .",
    "as we will show in this paper , with slight simplification one can introduce simpler models which although retain most of the small world features , are still amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "this is what we are trying to do in this paper . in this paper",
    "we introduce one such model following our earlier work @xcite which was in turn inspired by the work of @xcite .",
    "the basic simplifying feature of these networks is that all the shortcuts are made via a central site , figure ( [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "for such a network many of the small world quantities , can be calculated exactly .    ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    in particular , once @xmath0 defined above is calculated , many other quantities like the average shortest path between two sites can be obtained .",
    "an exact calculation of @xmath0 is however difficult for the case where both the shortcuts and the links have random directions .",
    "we therefore proceed in two steps to separate the effects of randomness in the two types of connections .",
    "first , in section 2 , we remove the shortcuts and calculate exactly @xmath0 for a ring with random links , figure ( [ fig-3 ] ) .    .",
    ", width=302 ]    to emphasize the absence of shortcuts we denote this quantity by @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath6 depends only on the structure of the underlying ring and its short - range connections . then in section 3",
    ", we consider only the effects of randomly directed shortcuts , that is we let directions of the links on the ring to be regular and fixed say clockwise , and calculate exactly @xmath0 , where again for emphasis on the shortcuts we denote this quantity by @xmath8 .",
    "+ we then argue , in section 4 that in the scaling limit where the number of sites goes to infinity with the number of shortcuts kept finite , most of the spreading takes place via the links and only from time to time it propagates to remote points via the shortcuts . in this limit",
    "it is plausible to suggest a form for @xmath0 which takes into account the effect of both the random links and the shortcuts in the form @xmath9",
    ". this may not be an exact relation but as we will see it will give a fairly good approximation of @xmath0 , as shown by the agreement of our analytical results and the results of simulations .",
    "this then means that in more complicated networks , one can separate the effects of short and long range connections and superimpose their effect in a suitable way . we conclude the paper with a discussion .",
    "consider a regular ring of @xmath2 sites whose bonds are directed randomly .",
    "each link may be directed clockwise with probability @xmath10 , counterclockwise with probability @xmath11 , and bidirectional with probability @xmath12 .",
    "+ thus we have a problem similar to bond percolation in a small world network .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath13 site number @xmath14 is infected with a virus .",
    "we ask the following questions : + after @xmath1 seconds how many sites have been infected on the average ? what is the average speed of propagation of this decease in the network ?",
    "these questions have obvious answers for rings with regularly directed or bi - directional bonds , namely the number of infected sites are respectively @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with corresponding speeds of propagation being @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the randomly directed network",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "for example if both neighbors of site @xmath14 are directed into this site , this site can not affect any other site of the network .",
    "such a site being effectively isolated has an _ accessible world _",
    "@xcite of zero size ( figure[fig-3 ] ) . to proceed with exact calculation ,",
    "consider the right hand side of site @xmath14 .",
    "the probability that exactly @xmath19 extra sites to the right have been infected is @xmath20 , and the probability that exactly @xmath21 extra sites have been infected is @xmath22 . therefore the average number of extra sites infected to the right of the original site is @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] going to the large @xmath2 limit where , @xmath24 we find the simple result @xmath25 the same type of reasoning gives the number of sites infected to the left @xmath26 and thus the total number of infected sites will be : @xmath27 where @xmath28 . what are the meaning of the scaled variables ?",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the total number of sparse blocked sites in the way of propagation to the right , with a similar meaning for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the fraction of infected sites up to time @xmath32 . in a bidirectional lattice , all the sites",
    "could be infected after the passage of @xmath33 seconds , or at @xmath34 and if @xmath35 passes @xmath36 , some of the sites become doubly visited .",
    "therefore it is plausible for the sake of comparison to define a quantity in our ring , namely the average size of the _ accessible _ world as @xmath37 , which turns out to be : @xmath38 it is seen that the presence of only a small number of blocked bonds causes a significant drop in the average size of this accessible world . for example a value of @xmath39 leads to @xmath40 .",
    "the long range connections ( shortcuts ) make the world small with the ease of communication they provide , however blockades make the world small in this new sense . + the speed of propagation is found from @xmath41 in the symmetric case where @xmath42 , equation ( [ dd ] ) simplifies to : @xmath43 with @xmath44 note that at the early stages of spreading when @xmath45 , and the effects of blocked bonds has not yet been experienced , the infection propagates with speed equal to @xmath18 as in a regular network .",
    "the effect of blocking comes into play when @xmath32 becomes comparable to @xmath46 . + as a few number of shortcuts may enhance the speed of propagation , a few number of blocked bonds may have the opposing effect .",
    "first the blocks reduce the speed of propagation as is clear from ( [ dddd ] ) and second and more importantly they reduce the number of accessible sites , or the size of accessible world .",
    "it will thus be of interest to see how these two effects compete in a random network where there are both shortcuts and blocks .",
    "we will study this in the final section of this paper . to this end",
    "we first study the effect of directed shortcuts in an otherwise regular ring with no blocks .",
    "in this section we are to consider only the effect of randomly directed shortcuts in the spreading process and obtain exactly the function @xmath47 for this network , figure ( [ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "note that this function has the same meaning as @xmath0 , except that for emphasis on the role of shortcuts in it we have adopted a new name for it .",
    "we fix a regular clockwise ring . between a site and the center",
    "there is a shortcut going into the center with probability @xmath48 and out of the center with probability @xmath49 .",
    "the site remains unconnected to the center with probability @xmath50 .",
    "the average number of connections into and out of the center are respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "+ consider sites @xmath14 and @xmath53 .",
    "we want to find the probability that the shortest path between these two sites be of length @xmath54 , a probability which we denote by @xmath55 . a typical shortest path of length @xmath54 connecting these two nodes is shown in figure ( [ fig-4 ] ) , where the first inward connection to the center occurs at site @xmath56 and the last outward connection from the center occurs at site @xmath57 .",
    "such a path occurs with probability @xmath58 .",
    "summing over all such configurations gives us the probability for the shortest path between sites @xmath14 and @xmath53 to be of length @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath59 , we have : + @xmath60,\\ ] ] and @xmath61 is determined from normalization : @xmath62 note that @xmath63 dose not depend on @xmath53 , a property which is true for standard small world networks @xcite .",
    "+ now consider a naive spreading process starting at site @xmath14 .",
    "the number of sites affected up to time @xmath15 , denoted by @xmath47 , builds up in two ways , via the links on the ring and via the shortcuts .",
    "the first way gives a contribution @xmath64 and the second way gives a contribution @xmath65 @xcite where @xmath66 is the number of sites beyond direct reach at time @xmath1 which has been multiplied by the probability of any of these sites being at a distance shorter than @xmath1 to site @xmath14 via a shortcut .",
    "putting this together we find : + @xmath67\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the scaling limit where @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are kept fixed and @xmath71 , we find : @xmath72 in the symmetric case where @xmath73 this equation simplifies to : @xmath74 with the speed of propagation @xmath75 figure ( [ fig-5 ] ) shows the speed of propagation as a function of time for several values of @xmath76 .",
    "we now come to the problem of composing both the blocks and the shortcuts in a model of small world network .",
    "that is we consider the ring of figure ( [ fig-2 ] ) where randomly directed shortcuts are added to a ring with randomly directed links .",
    "we can not obtain exact expressions for this network from first principle probability considerations .",
    "however we can obtain expressions for @xmath77 in the scaling limit by a heuristic argument and compare our results with those of simulations .",
    "consider equation ( [ 18s ] ) .",
    "this equation shows how the presence of @xmath78 randomly directed shortcuts in a regular clockwise ring affects the spreading effect . on the other hand",
    "we know that the number of sites infected up to time @xmath35 in the absence of shortcuts , has changed to @xmath79 .",
    "due to the rarity of shortcuts compared to the regular bonds , most of the spreading takes place via the local bonds , the role of shortcuts is just to make multiple spreading processes happen in different regions of the network .",
    "this role is the same whatever the underlying lattice is , and therefore for a general network , at least in the scaling regime , we can assume that equation ( [ 18s ] ) can be elevated to @xmath80 , i.e ; @xmath81 for a fully random network where @xmath78 randomly directed shortcuts are distributed on a ring with already random links , we assume that this relation holds true with @xmath82 taken from ( [ dd ] ) .",
    "this suggestion may not provide an exact solution for the network , however we think it provides a fairly good approximation . in fact",
    "exact solution for the case where all the links on the ring are bidirectional is possible and it confirms the above ansatz , that is we obtain an exact expression only by setting @xmath83 in the above formula .",
    "moreover this separation of the effect of short and long range connections may be also useful in more complicated networks .",
    "whether this assumption is plausible or not can be checked by comparison with simulations .",
    "the results of simulations are compared with those of equations ( [ dd ] ) and([18 ] ) in figure ( [ fig-6 ] ) and ( [ fig-7 ] ) .     for a fully random network in the case @xmath84 .",
    "analytic results(lines ) versus simulations(symbols ) which have been averaged over @xmath85 realizations of the network.,width=302 ]     for a fully random network in the case @xmath86 .",
    "analytic results(lines ) versus simulations(symbols ) .,width=302 ]",
    "once the functions @xmath87 or @xmath77 are obtained , the static properties of the network i.e. , the average shortest path between two arbitrary sites and its probability distribution can be calculated directly .",
    "+ since @xmath0 by definition is the number of sites whose shortest distance to site @xmath14 is less than or equal to @xmath1 , we find the number of sites whose shortest distance is exactly @xmath1 to be @xmath88 . since site @xmath14 is an arbitrary site , we find the probability distribution of the shortest distance between two arbitrary sites which are accessible to each other as : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the average size of the accessible world .",
    "( there is of course a slight approximation here in that we are taking averages of the denominator and numerator separately . )",
    "+ for a regular ring with shortcuts , @xmath91 , since all the sites are accessible .",
    "we will discuss the case of random rings in the sequel . in the scaling regime the above formulas transform to : @xmath92 note that @xmath93 is normalized , i.e. @xmath94",
    ". the average shortest path for the network of figure ( [ fig-4 ] ) when @xmath95 , turns out to be : @xmath96 this is in accord with the result of @xcite .",
    "this formula shows that the presence of a small number of shortcuts , causes a significant drop in the average shortest path from @xmath17 to very small values . in this sense",
    "the world gets smaller by long range connections .",
    "+ we now study the static effects of random directed bonds on a ring without shortcuts .",
    "the presence of blocks makes the world small in a different sense , namely for each site the number of accessible sites gets smaller .",
    "in fact the average size of the world accessible to a site is not @xmath2 anymore but it is given by @xmath97 ( see the paragraph leading to equation ( [ ddd ] ) ) .",
    "hence the probability of shortest paths is given by @xmath98 , or in the scaling limit by @xmath99 this probability is normalized , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "we obtain from ( [ static4 ] ) @xmath101 however in order to assess the situation in this network , we should compare the average shortest path with the size of this small world itself , namely we should calculate @xmath102 . inserting equation ( [ dds ] ) into ( [ static5 ] )",
    "we find : @xmath103 figure ( [ fig-8 ] ) shows both the average size of the accessible world @xmath104 and the ratio @xmath105 of the average shortest path to the size of accessible world as a function of the number of blocks @xmath106 .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath107 , when there is no block , the size is @xmath108 and the average of the shortest path is @xmath109 as it should be . with a few number of blocks the size drops dramatically and the average of shortest path within the world increases . note that with increasing @xmath106 the average shortest path increases to its maximum value of @xmath110 . +        for the fully random network , we use equations ( [ eee ] ) and ( [ static4 ] ) to obtain the average of shortest path .",
    "the result is shown in figure ( [ fig-9 ] ) for several values of the parameters .",
    "we have studied the effect of directed short and long range connections in a simple model of small world network . in our models",
    "all the shortcuts pass via a central site in the network .",
    "this makes possible an almost exact calculation of many of the properties of the network .",
    "we have calculated the function @xmath0 , defined as the number of sites affected up to time @xmath1 when a naive spreading process starts in the network .",
    "as opposed to shortcuts , the presence of un - favorable bonds has a negative effect on this quantity",
    ". hence the spreading process may be able to affect only a fraction of the total sites of the network .",
    "we have defined this fraction to be the average size of the accessible world in our model and have calculated it exactly for our model .",
    "we have studied also the interplay of shortcuts , and un - favorable bonds on the small world properties like the size of accessible world , the speed of propagation of a spreading process , and the average shortest path between two arbitrary sites .",
    "our results show that one can separately take into account the effect of randomness in the directions of shortcuts and the short - range connections in the underlying lattice and at the end super - impose the two effects in a suitable way .",
    "we expect that this will hold also in more complicated lattices of small world networks ."
