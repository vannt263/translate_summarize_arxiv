    "future space missions like gaia , ongoing searches for planets , and other large projects will greatly increase the number of known multiple stars and components , making it urgent to develop a coherent and unambiguous designation scheme . recognizing this",
    "need , iau formed a special group that held its meetings in 2000 and 2003 . as a result",
    ", iau adopted the designation system developed for the washington multiple star catalogue ( wmc ) @xcite , an extension of the current designations in the washington double star catalogue ( wds ) @xcite .",
    "old wds designations will not change ( to avoid further confusion ) , new component names will be constructed hierarchically as sequences of letters and numbers , e.g. ab2 .",
    "the designations reflect hierarchical structure of multiple systems , but only to a certain extent .",
    "future discoveries of components at outer or intermediate levels of hierarchy and the constraint of fixed designations will inevitably lead to situations where names do not reflect the true hierarchy , which has then to be coded separately .        in the future , many components of multiple systems will be resolved into sub - systems , so that a will become aa and ab , for example .",
    "nevertheless , current designations of these components ( or rather _ super - components _ , as they contain more than one star ) will not become obsolete , because past and future measurements of these entities as a whole will still refer to the super - component names such as `` a '' in our example . it turns out that the concept of super - components is crucial to the whole problem .",
    "once each super - component has its own designation , unique within each multiple system , we can code hierarchies by simple reference to parent ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the wmc designation system extended to normal components and super - components is thus logical and flexible , permitting to accommodate new discoveries .",
    "its application is not free of ambiguity , however , so that a common center ( or clearing house ) will still be required .",
    "the wmc itself will hopefully play this role .",
    "although multiple stars are quite common , this fact is not reflected in the catalogues . a researcher wishing to study large samples of multiple stars has to compile his own lists or use the lists published by others , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is equally possible to extract multiple stars from binary catalogues .",
    "the current 9-th catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits , sb9 @xcite , contains multiplicity notes and visual - component designations .",
    "many visual multiples are listed in the wds @xcite , but the physical relation between their components has not been studied systematically , many are simple line - of - sight projections ( optical ) .    the multiple star catalogue ( msc ) @xcite is an attempt to create and maintain a list of _ physical _ systems with 3 or more components .",
    "the msc is essentially complete for `` historical '' multiple systems known before 1996 , with the exception of visual multiples ( only a fraction of wds multiples have been checked for physical relation ) .",
    "the completeness of the msc ( 1024 systems as of july 2005 ) is less evident with respect to new discoveries .",
    "an on - line interface to the msc became available recently .",
    "the msc contains estimates of component masses and orbital parameters , essential for statistical studies , e.g. @xcite .",

    "evidently , @xmath3 .",
    "batten @xcite defines the multiplicity ratio @xmath4 and argues that @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",

    "short - period sub - systems and kozai cycles .",
    "* spectroscopic binaries in the field seem to have a period distribution that smoothly rises toward longer periods in the range from 1 to 1000  d , according to several independent studies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of periods of spectroscopic sub - systems in multiple stars shows a maximum at periods below 7  d @xcite .",
    "this `` feature '' is too sharp to be explained by selection effects , and the transition period is suspiciously similar to the cutoff period of tidal circularization .",
    "dissipative kozai cycles are the most likely mechanism that shortens periods of many ( but not all ) sub - systems below 7  d.    * relative orientation of orbits * has been studied by sterzik & tokovinin @xcite . only in 22 cases",
    "the _ visual _ orbits of both outer and inner sub - systems are known .",
    "this extremely small sample has small ratios of outer - to - inner periods @xmath22 because at long @xmath23 the time coverage of existing visual data ( about 200 yr ) is still too short ( in fact , many long - period orbits are uncertain or wrong ) , while orbits with short @xmath24 are difficult to get for the lack of spatial resolution .",
    "the true ascending nodes of visual orbits are , generally , not identified , further complicating data interpretation . the advent of adaptive optics and long - baseline interferometry holds great promise in extending this sample significantly , mostly by resolving the inner ( spectroscopic ) sub - systems in visual binaries with known outer orbits , e.g. @xcite .    despite current observational limitations ,",
    "it is already clear that the inner and outer orbits are neither coplanar nor completely random .",
    "the directions of their orbital angular momenta are weakly correlated .",
    "such correlation could be explained by dynamical decay of small stellar groups @xcite .",
    "however , alternative explanations are possible , too .",
    "it will be extremely important to extend the studies of relative orbit orientation to larger samples and to start probing the orientations in different sub - groups .",
    "* empirical stability criterion .",
    "* multiple systems where both inner and outer orbits are known offer rich possibilities for joint analysis of their orbital parameters , e.g. checking the dynamical stability .",
    "theoretical and numerical formulations of the stability criterion in the three - body problem have been offered by many authors and lead to similar results .",
    "i take the latest work of mardling & aarseth @xcite ( ma02 ) as representative and compare their stability criterion with 120 real systems from the msc ( fig .",
    "some systems are , apparently , unstable .",
    "however , i can ignore both unreliable outer orbits with periods over 300  yr and inner periods shorter than 10d ( likely affected by kozai cycles ) , plotted as crosses in fig .",
    "the remaining systems ( diamonds ) nicely fall in the stability zone .    when outer orbits are nearly circular , the match between the data and the ma02 criterion is impressive : all systems indeed have @xmath25 . however , eccentric outer orbits deviate from the theoretical criterion in a systematic way .",
    "the _ empirical stability criterion _",
    "@xcite can be described by the relation @xmath26 , whereas all theoretical criteria lead to a similar relation with @xmath27 instead of cube .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy remains a mystery .",
    "* period - period diagram .",
    "* what is a typical period ratio @xmath28 at adjacent hierarchical levels ?",
    "fekel @xcite found it to be large , around 2000 . in the msc",
    ", we encounter all possible ratios allowed by the dynamical stability , i.e. greater than 5 .",
    "however , systems at intermediate hierarchical levels often remain undiscovered , leading to wrongly estimated period ratios . by restricting the sample to nearby ( within 50  pc ) late - type stars ,",
    "we reduce these errors and begin to see the true distribution of period ratios ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 diagram reveals some features of multiple - star formation and evolution .",
    "interestingly , period ratios larger than 10000 are found only when @xmath30d , i.e. where inner periods were likely shortened by some dissipative mechanism like kozai cycles with tides .",
    "the only exception to this rule ( the point at the top ) is capella , a pair of giants on a 100-d circular orbit in a quadruple system .",
    "it is very likely that all multiple stars have been formed with the period ratio @xmath31 .",
    "some inner periods were then shortened by tidal or other dissipative processes . in this perspective",
    ", capella had a rather eccentric initial orbit with a period of few tens of years which has been shortened and circularized when its components became giants .",
    "cataloguing of multiple systems , however boring it might seem , offers interesting insights into formation and evolution of stars . new powerful observing techniques ( adaptive optics , interferometry , precise radial velocities ) should now be applied to large stellar samples in order to `` fix '' the multiplicity statistics in the solar neighborhood and beyond .",
