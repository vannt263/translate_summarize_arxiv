[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in eq.([resultmasses ] ) we present masses for the four families of quarks and leptons as obtained after the monte - carlo fit @xmath126 the results of the monte - carlo fit shows that the requirement , that the ratios of the corresponding parameters of @xmath72 for the quarks and the leptons should be as close to the rational numbers as possible , makes that the fourth family lies within the experimentally allowed values as evaluated by the refs.@xcite .",
    "eq.([omegatilde ] ) , however , tells us , that it is the top mass and the masses of the fourth family which mostly ( not entirely ) determine these ratios .",
    "but integer or half integer ratios could still be a sign that some group properties or even nonperturbative effects connected with the charges of quarks and leptons determine the masses of fermions , since if we move the masses from those allowed by the refs.@xcite , the ratios go to one only when all the masses of the fourth family are equal and are high in comparison with the top mass .",
    "the monte - carlo fit leads to the following mixing matrix for the quarks @xmath127 and for the leptons @xmath128 the estimated mixing matrix for the four families of quarks predicts quite a strong couplings between the fourth and the other three families , limiting ( due to the assumptions and approximations we made , which manifest in the symmetric mixing matrices ) some of the matrix elements of the three families as well .",
    "the estimated mixing matrix for the four families of leptons predicts very probably far too strong couplings between the known three and the fourth family ( although they are not in contradiction with the report in@xcite ) .",
    "let us end up this section by repeating that all the predictions must be taken as a very rough estimation , since they follow from the approach unifying spins and charges after many approximations and assumptions , which we made to be able to come in quite a short way to simple and transparent predictions .",
    "in this paper and in the previous one@xcite we study a possibility that the approach of one of us@xcite , unifying spins and charges , might be a new right way for answering those of the open questions of the standard model of the electroweak and colour interaction , which are connected with the appearance of families of fermions , of the yukawa couplings and of the weak scale : why do only the left handed spinors carry the weak charge , while the right handed are weak chargeless ? where do the families of the quarks and the leptons come from ? what does determine the strenghts of the yukawa couplings and the weak scale ?    within the approach unifying spins and charges the answer to the question , why only the left handed spinors carry the weak charge , while the right handed are weak chargeless , does exist : the representation of one weyl spinor of the group so(1,13 ) , analyzed with respect to the properties of the subgroups so(1,7)x su(3)xu(1 ) of this group and further with respect to su(2 ) and the second u(1 ) , manifests the left handed weak charged quarks and leptons and the right handed weak chargeless quarks and leptons .",
    "the approach answers as well the question about a possible origin of the  dressing  of the right handed quarks and leptons in the standard model : the approach proposes the lagrange density for fermions in @xmath22-dimensional space in which the gauge field of the poincar ' e group is the only interaction through spin connections and vielbeins .",
    "it is a part of the spin connection field , which connects the right handed weak chargeless spinors with the left handed weak charged ones , playing the role of the higgs field ( and the yukawa couplings within a family ) of the standard model .",
    "the approach is answering also the question about the origin of the families of quarks and leptons : two kinds of the clifford algebra objects gauging two kinds of the spin connection fields , are asumed .",
    "one kind takes care of the spin and the charges and of connecting right handed weak chargeless fermions with left handed weak charged fermions .",
    "the other kind takes care of the families of fermions and consequently of the yukawa couplings among the families contributing also to the diagonal elements . in the previous paper@xcite we derived from the approach - after making several approximations , assumptions and simplifications - the expressions for the yukawa couplings for four families of quarks and leptons .",
    "approximations , assumptions and simplifications lead to very simple expressions for the mass matrices for the four families of quarks and leptons in terms of the spin connection fields of the two kinds .",
    "the approximate break of the symmetry - from @xmath129 to @xmath130 in the @xmath131 sector - suggests that three angles might in quite a good approximation determine the mixing matrices for the four families of quarks and leptons .",
    "we use this suggestion to simplify further estimations .",
    "we must , however , add that an approximate break of the symmetry from @xmath129 to @xmath132 instead would suggest that the fourth family is very weakly coupled to the first three and would accordingly strongly change our - very preliminary - results .",
    "( while such a break seems to be even acceptable when describing properties of leptons , it would predict for quarks much too strong couplings between the third and the first two families than they measured . )    not knowing the way of breaking symmetries from @xmath4 to the observed ones for any of the two types of the symmetries ( the poincar ' e one and the one connected with the generators , @xmath19 ) , we could only guess it through assumptions which do not contradict the experimental data and by treating the breaking in both sectors ( @xmath40 and @xmath19 ) equivalently as much as possible .",
    "we assume that effects like the breaking of symmetries or nonperturbative effects might be responsible for the difference in the nondiagonal matrix elements of the yukawa couplings , while in the diagonal ones the difference in matrix elements originates also in the difference in the quantum numbers carried by quarks and leptons .",
    "we treat quarks and leptons equivalently and did not take into account a possible existence of the majorana neutrinos : all the masses are the dirac masses .",
    "we make in this paper a rough prediction of the properties of the fourth family for quarks and leptons by connecting the parameter of our approach with the experimental data .",
    "we fix the masses of the fourth family by requiring that the ratios of the corresponding parameters of the approach for quarks and leptons are as close to the rational numbers as possible .",
    "we get numbers like @xmath133 or @xmath134 for these ratios and let for further studies to better understand the influence of the way of breaking symmetries and of the nonperturbative ( or perturbative ) effects on the properties of families at `` physical energies '' .",
    "our rough estimation of the properties of the fourth family agrees with the analyses of refs.@xcite and it predicts the fourth family masses @xmath135 gev , @xmath136 gev , @xmath137 gev , @xmath138 gev .",
    "the mixing matrices are in our rough prediction symmetric since mass matrices are assumed to be symmetric and real .",
    "predictions for the couplings between the fourth and the other three families seem reasonable for quarks , while for leptons the corresponding mixing matrix elements might suggest that either different break of symmetries in the @xmath19 sector from the assumed one , or the majorana neutrinos , or both effects should at least be further studied .",
    "to try to answer within the approach unifying spins and charges the open question of the standard model : why the weak scale appears as it does ?",
    "a more detailed study of the breaks of symmetries in both sectors is needed .",

    "<S> spinors , namely , living in @xmath0dimensional space , manifest in the observed @xmath1-dimensional space ( at  physical energies  ) all the known charges of quarks and leptons ( with the mass protection property of the standard model - only the left handed quarks and leptons carry the weak charge while the right handed ones are weak chargeless - included ) , while a part of the starting lagrange density in @xmath2 transforms the right handed quarks and leptons into the left handed ones , manifesting a mass term in @xmath3 . since a spinor carries two kinds of spins and interacts accordingly with two kinds of the spin connection fields , the approach predicts families and the corresponding yukawa couplings . in the paper@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of families of quarks and leptons within this approach was investigated and the explicit expressions for the corresponding yukawa couplings , following from the approach after some approximations and simplifications , presented . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we continue investigations of this new way of presenting families of quarks and leptons by further analyzing properties of mass matrices , treating quarks and leptons in an equivalent way . we connect free parameters of the approach with the known experimental data and </S>",
    "<S> investigate a possibility that the fourth family of quarks and leptons appears at low enough energies to be observable with the new generation of accelerators . </S>"
