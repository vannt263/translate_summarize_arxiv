    "the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is investigated in large - scale lattice gauge theory simulations @xcite and heavy - ion collision experiments at cern - sps and rhic brookhaven @xcite , where the approximately baryon - free region at finite temperatures is accessible and consensus about the critical temperature for the occurence of a strongly correlated quark - gluon plasma phase ( sqgp ) is developing .",
    "the region of low temperatures and high baryon densities , however , which is interesting for the astrophysics of compact stars , is not accessible to lattice qcd studies yet and heavy - ion collision experiments such as the cbm experiment at fair darmstadt are still in preparation @xcite .",
    "the most stringent of the presently available constraints on the eos of superdense hadronic matter from compact stars and heavy - ion collisions have recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and may form the basis for future systematic investigations of the compatibility of dense quark matter models with those phenomenological constraints . therefore , the question arises for appropriate models describing the nonperturbative properties of strongly interacting matter such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and hadronic bound state formation in the vacuum and at finite temperatures and densities .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model has proven very useful for providing results to this question within a simple , but microscopic formulation , mostly on the mean - field level , see @xcite .",
    "the state of the art phase diagrams of neutral quark matter for compact star applications have recently been obtained in @xcite where also references to other approaches can be found .",
    "one of the shortcomings of the njl model is the absence of confinement , the other is its nonrenormalizability .",
    "it is customary to speak of the njl model in its form with a cut - off regularization , where physical observables can be defined and calculated .",
    "the cutoff in momentum space , however , defines a range of the interaction and makes the njl model nonlocal .",
    "it has been suggested that the cutoff - regularized njl model can be considered as a limiting case of a more general formulation of nonlocal chiral quark models using separable interactions @xcite . in this form",
    "one can even make contact with the dyson - schwinger equation approach to qcd by defining a separable representation of the effective gluon propagator @xcite , or to the instanton liquid model , see @xcite .",
    "we have made extensive use of the parametrization given in @xcite for studies of quark matter phases in compact stars @xcite where the role of the smoothness of the momentum dependence for the quark - hadron phase transition and compact star structure has been explored .",
    "these investigations have been also used in simulations of hybrid star cooling @xcite , which can be selective for the choice of the quation of state ( eos ) of quark matter by comparing to observational data feor surface temperature and age of compact stars . as a result of these studies , color superconducting phases with small gaps of the order of 10 kev - 1 mev",
    "appear to be favorable for the cooling phenomenology .",
    "a prominent candidate , the color - spin - locking ( csl ) phase , has been investigated more in detail within the njl model with satisfactory results @xcite .",
    "however , its generalization to formfactors with a smooth momentum dependence revealed a severe sensitivity resulting in variations of the csl gaps over four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , with the njl parametrization given in @xcite it was not possible to reproduce results with njl parametrizations given in @xcite and used , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore , in the present work a new parametrization of the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is performed with a special emphasis on reproducing njl parametrizations given in @xcite in the limiting case of a sharp cutoff formfactor .",
    "we also take into account the strangeness degree of freedom and consider lorentzian - type formfactor models where the form of the momentum dependence for the quark - quark interaction can be varied parametrically thus being most suitable for a quantitative analysis the phase diagram and high - density eos under the above mentioned constraints from compact star and heavy - ion collision phenomenology .",
    "we consider a nonlocal chiral quark model with separable quark - antiquark interaction in the color singlet scalar / pseudoscalar isovector channel @xcite where the formfactors are given in the instantaneous approximation , in the same way as it was suggested in @xcite .    the lagrangian density of the quark model is given by ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3,\\ ] ] where indices occuring twice are to be summed over and the formfactor @xmath4 for the nonlocal current - current coupling has been introduced .",
    "here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the current quark masses of the light and strange flavors , respectively , @xmath7 are the gell - mann matrices of the @xmath8 flavor group and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are dirac matrices .    the nonlocality of the current - current interaction in the quark - antiquark ( @xmath11 ) channel is implemented in the separable approximation via the same formfactor functions for all colors and flavors . in our calculations",
    "we use the gaussian ( g ) , lorentzian ( l ) , woods - saxon ( ws ) and cutoff ( njl ) formfactors in momentum space defined as ( see ref .",

    "typically , three - flavor njl type models use a t hooft determinant interaction that induces a u@xmath15(1 ) symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar isoscalar meson sector , which can be adjusted such that the @xmath16-@xmath17 mass difference is described . in the present approach",
    "this term is neglected using the motivation given in @xcite , so that the flavor sectors decouple in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the dynamical quark mass functions are then given by @xmath18 , where the chiral gaps fulfill the gap equations @xmath19 corresponding to minima of the thermodynamic potential with respect to variations of the order parameters @xmath20 , the quark dispersion relations are @xmath21 .",
    "the basic set of equations should be chosen to fix the parameters included in the model , which are the current masses , coupling constant and cutoff parameter ( @xmath22 and @xmath1 ) .    in order to do that we use the properties of bound states of quarks in the vacuum given by the pion decay constant @xmath23  mev , the masses of the pion @xmath24 mev and the kaon @xmath25 mev and either the constituent quark mass @xmath26 or the chiral condensate of light quarks , defined as @xmath27 with a phenomenological value from qcd sum rules @xcite of @xmath28 mev @xmath29 mev .",
    "the chiral condensate generally is not properly defined in the case of nonlocal interactions .",
    "the subtraction of the @xmath30 term has been included to make the integral convergent .",
    "the pion  decay  constant can be expressed in the form @xmath31where the pion wave function renormalization factor @xmath32 is @xmath33 the masses of pion and kaon are obtained from a direct generalization of the well - known njl model @xcite by introducing formfactors with the momentum space integration and replacing constituent quark masses by the momentum dependent mass functions @xmath34",

    "since we have no t hooft term , there is no mixing of flavor sectors , and one can consider the light quark sector independent of the strange one . the equation for the kaon mass fixes the strange quark s current mass @xmath6 , whereby a self - consistent solution of the strange quark gap equation is implied .",
    "in the present parametrization scheme the gap equation plays a special role .",
    "although the gap is not an observable quantity , we will use it as an phenomenological input instead of the condensate , which in some cases does not fulfill the phenomenological constraints .",
    "moreover , for each formfactor model there is some minimal value of @xmath50 for which the condensate has a minimum : for the gaussian model it is 7.376 , for the lorentzian model with @xmath51 it is 3.795 , and for @xmath52 it is 2.825 . for the njl model",
    "this minimal value is 2.588 .",
    "the corresponding values of the condensate are given in table [ lorsysm ] .",
    "these values for the finite current masses are shifted to the left as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ patalogy ] and for them the parameter sets are fixed ( see table [ lorsysm ] ) .",
    "when the condensate is chosen there are two possible values of @xmath50 ( the lower and higher branches ) for which one can fix the parameters of the model .",
    "we show that the constraint on the condensate from qcd sum rules @xcite with an upper limit at @xmath53 mev can be fulfilled only for values of @xmath54 exceeding 3 - 5 for both lorentzian and woods- saxon formfactor models . for the particular choice of @xmath55 mev and 260 mev we fixed the parameters for both branches of solutions ( see tables [ ll260 ] -[njl ] ) .    in order to obtain the parameter sets we choose three values for the non - observable value of the constituent quark mass @xmath56 mev , 335 mev , 367.5 mev , 380 mev , and 400 mev .",
    "the values are taken such that the mass @xmath57 is larger than the mass of the nucleon as a bound state of three quarks .",
    "the results of the parametrizations are given in the tables [ l330]-[l400 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ patalogy ] the dependence of the chiral condensate is shown as a function of @xmath58 for different formfactors in the chiral limit band for an appropriate choice of the current mass @xmath59 .",
    "it is shown that the minimal possible value of the condensate varies from one formfactor model to another and only in the njl model the appropriate values of condensate in the range of qcd sum rule values @xmath60 mev can be reached . the figs .",
    "[ ffcomp ] and [ ffpcomp ] show the gap function and the diagonal elements of the separable interaction for different formfactors in order to demonstrate the systematics of the changes related to the degree of the softening given by the parameter @xmath54 in lorentzian functions .",
    "we have presented parametrizations of nonlocal chiral quark models with instantaneous , separable interactions defined by momentum dependent formfactors which interpolate between the soft gaussian type and the hard cut off ( njl ) in tabulated form .",
    "the introduction of a lorentzian and/or woods - saxon - type function with an additional parameter allowed a systematic investigation of the njl model limit , where existing parametrizations could be recovered .",
    "we have shown that the instantaneous nonlocal models have an essential problem for the softest formfactors , where it is impossible to obtain acceptable values for the chiral condensate . however , for the astrophysical applications this problem could be considered as of minor importance relative to the insights which a systematic variation of the interaction model offers for the better understanding of mechanisms governing the quark matter eos on a microscopic level .",
    "the present approach to nonlocal chiral quark models can be applied subsequently for systematic studies of constraints on the eos of superdense matter coming from the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions and compact stars .",
