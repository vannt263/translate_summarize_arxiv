    "amidst the rich phenomenology of @xmath1-mesons lies a severe problem  so old that new solutions are rarely attempted  associated with the strangeness - changing @xmath17=1 , nonleptonic decays of the short- and long - lived states @xmath18 experimentally , there is a large enhancement of the isospin-@xmath19 decays .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly striking in the @xmath20-wave @xmath21 mode , where the measured rates @xcite exhibit the ratios @xmath22 which are in enormous disagreement with the naive expectations @xmath23 from perturbative electroweak calculations .",
    "it is useful to translate the above in terms of isospin amplitudes @xmath24 for the final @xmath21 state .",
    "the @xmath25 state is forbidden by bose symmetry and thus the transition amplitudes can be parametrized as @xcite @xmath26 where the @xmath21-scattering phase shifts @xmath27 arise as a consequence of watson s theorem .",
    "comparison with the data in ( [ eqn : rates ] ) leads to the @xmath0 rule for kaons @xmath28 whose origin remains a mystery despite five decades of theoretical investigation .",
    "the difficulty presumably arises from the nonperturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies @xmath29 , where confinement reigns and chiral symmetry for the light quarks @xmath4 is believed to be spontaneously broken by the formation of a quark condensate @xmath30 below the chiral symmetry - breaking scale @xmath31 gev , great progress has been made in charting the low - energy structure of qcd through the use of chiral @xmath32 perturbation theory @xmath33 .",
    "the method relies on an alternative expansion parameter to the strong coupling @xmath34 , _",
    "viz_.  low - energy scattering amplitudes and matrix elements can be described by an asymptotic series @xmath35 in powers of @xmath36 momentum and quark masses @xmath37 .",
    "the amplitudes of the series are then calculated in a systematic manner by constructing the most general effective lagrangian consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "for example , the strong interactions of @xmath7 mesons are described in the leading order ( lo ) of @xmath33 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath40 is proportional to the @xmath4 quark mass matrix . here",
    "@xmath41 is an @xmath42 field , where the octet of pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons @xmath43 parametrize the coset space @xmath44 with group action @xmath45 the method can likewise be applied to the weak interactions and used to simulate nonleptonic decays . the chiral structure of the weak currents @xmath46 constrains the number of allowed operators .",
    "for instance , in the leading order of @xmath47pt@xmath48 , two octets can be constructed with the required transformation properties , _",
    "viz_.  the derivative operator @xcite @xmath49 and a weak mass operator @xcite @xmath50 as an @xmath42 octet , @xmath51 is necessarily isospin-@xmath19 , however the requirement of a stable vacuum ensures that this operator does not contribute to physical processes . in this regard",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the effective potential is minimized by a chiral rotation such that @xmath52 and @xmath40 is diagonal and positive . by aligning the vacuum in this way ,",
    "all trace of @xmath51 is removed from the effective lagrangian , and thus by including the @xmath53-spin triplet component @xcite of a * 27 * operator @xmath54 the nonleptonic decays are described by the compact expression @xmath55 in general , the low - energy coefficients @xmath56 are not fixed by symmetry arguments alone .",
    "this constitutes the essence of the @xmath0 puzzle : why is @xmath57 unreasonably large ( @xmath58 22 ) when compared with simple quark - model estimates for @xmath59 @xmath1-decay amplitudes ? explaining this ` octet dominance ' has been tackled with a variety of techniques including the many color @xmath60 limit @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and direct evaluation on the lattice @xcite , each with varying degrees of success .",
    "the goal of this talk is to present an alternative line of investigation @xcite and argue that the @xmath0 rule for @xmath1-decays ( eq .  ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) ) is intimately linked to the behavior of @xmath3 in the _ asymptotic _ infrared limit .",
    "as is well known , the running of @xmath3 with scale @xmath61 is governed by the qcd @xmath62-function . at low energies",
    "@xmath63 , heavy quarks @xmath64 decouple from the theory , and thus there are two logical possibilities for the resulting three - flavor theory ( fig .  [",
    "fig : beta ] ) :    -function with three light quarks @xmath4 .",
    "the dashed line shows the case when the strong running coupling @xmath3 undergoes continued growth with decreasing scale @xmath61 ( item ( [ unbound ] ) in text ) , while the solid line shows @xmath3 flowing to an infrared fixed point @xmath2 ( item ( [ ir fixed pt ] ) ) . for completeness",
    ", we also include the case where @xmath3 diverges at a finite value of @xmath61 ( dotted line ) , but we emphasize that this scenario is of _ no physical relevance _ since it produces poles in green s functions in the spacelike momentum region ( i.e.  a tachyon or ",
    "landau ghost \" ) .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ]    1 .",
    "* growth without bound .",
    "* if the integral @xmath65 is divergent , then the solution to the renormalization group equation @xmath66 implies that as @xmath61 decreases , @xmath3 grows in value , becoming infinite in the infrared limit @xmath67 .",
    "analyses based on lattice simulations @xcite suggest that this scenario occurs for @xmath68 quark flavors ( pure yang - mills).[unbound ] 2 .   * infrared fixed point at finite coupling . * in this scenario , @xmath69 diverges because of a simple zero in @xmath70 at an infrared fixed point @xmath71 . from a purely phenomenological point of view , this situation is perhaps the most interesting for it implies that the gluonic term @xmath72 in the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath73 , @xmath74 vanishes at the fixed point @xmath2 and thus @xmath73 becomes traceless in the chiral limit @xmath75 naively , one might consider this scenario a phenomenological disaster : does a traceless @xmath76 not imply invariance under scaling transformations @xmath77 and hence a continuous mass spectrum ? in qcd , the answer is in the negative since the attendant strong gluon fields still drive quark condensation @xmath78 , from which one concludes that the scale  and of course , chiral  symmetry is in fact _",
    "spontaneously broken_. may act as a chiral - scale condensate was considered prior to the advent of qcd in refs .",
    "goldstone s theorem and approximate chiral - scale symmetry then implies that there are nine pseudo - ng bosons in the low - lying spectrum : the usual pseudoscalar octet @xmath7 and a @xmath79 qcd dilaton @xmath8 , whose mass is ( mostly ) set by the explicit breaking term @xmath80 in ( [ scale]).[ir fixed pt ]    it is worth emphasizing that it is unclear from the literature which scenario is actually realized in qcd , and in particular , how sensitive the results are to the number of active quark flavors .",
    "part of the problem resides in the fact that for each calculation , a nonperturbative _ definition _ for @xmath3 must be chosen , and thus comparing results from different approaches is rarely straightforward .",
    "popular choices include the schrdinger functional method on the lattice , @xcite solutions to dyson - schwinger equations @xcite for three - gluon and ghost- or quark - gluon vertices , the method of effective charges @xcite , and ads / cft inspired models @xcite .    despite the lack of consensus",
    ", we take the view that an infrared fixed point in qcd ( item ( [ ir fixed pt ] ) ) should be taken seriously , and the remainder of this talk concerns the phenomenological implications which arise from this scenario .",
    "while it may seem dramatic to introduce a new ng boson into the low - energy spectrum of qcd , there is in fact a very natural candidate for @xmath8 : the @xmath9 resonance , whose mass and width have been determined with remarkable precision through an analytic continuation of the roy equations @xcite , @xmath81 since this pioneering work , many studies ( see e.g. fig .  8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) have extracted @xmath82 pole parameters consistent with ( [ eqn : f0 pole ] ) , to the extent that the particle data group @xcite has recently updated their listing to account for the greatly reduced uncertainties .      in all determinations of the kind given by ref .",
    "@xcite , the real part of the @xmath82 pole is found to be @xmath83 .",
    "this places @xmath82 right in the middle of the ng sector @xmath7 and encourages us to revisit the observation @xcite that @xmath33 works well except for @xmath79 amplitudes with @xmath36 extrapolations in momentum . since @xmath82 is a broad flavor singlet coupled strongly to @xmath7 , it should dominate low - energy scattering .",
    "however , this leads to the following problem : @xmath82 can not contribute to the lo terms @xmath84 in ( [ eqn : asy exp ] ) so the dominant effect must be generated at next to leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "how does this square with the expectation that nlo terms are @xmath85 the lo prediction ?    one alternative ( and the one we shall pursue ) is to note that if @xmath86 is treated a pseudo - ng boson ( dilaton ) , then all the convergence issues in the @xmath79 channel disappear .",
    "to that end , we replace @xmath33 with a model - independent chiral - scale theory @xmath10 based on expansions in @xmath3 about @xmath2 .",
    "our task is to construct an effective field theory of approximate scale and chiral @xmath6 symmetry . for the strong interactions we seek an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath87 = : { \\cal l}^{d=4}_{\\mathrm{inv } }   + { \\cal l}^{d>4}_{\\mathrm{anom } } + { \\cal l}^{d<4}_{\\mathrm{mass}}:\\,,\\ ] ] where each term is distinguished by the scaling dimension @xmath88",
    ": @xmath89 the rules for constructing lagrangians of this type were worked out long ago and we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for explicit details .",
    "the salient features are as follows . for expansions in @xmath3 about @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath90 while the gluonic operator insertion @xmath91 ( obtained by acting @xmath92 on the callan - symanzik equation ) implies @xmath93 to realize scale invariance as a ng symmetry , a dilaton field @xmath8 is introduced with nonlinear scaling property @xmath94 so that @xmath95 is covariant and has @xmath96 : @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the dilaton decay constant , defined by the coupling of @xmath73 to the vacuum @xmath99 lagrangian operators of the required scale dimension are then obtained by multiplying operators such as @xmath100 by appropriate powers of @xmath95 . in the lo of @xmath10 the most general effective lagrangian for strongly interacting @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons",
    "is given by @xmath101 the low - energy constants @xmath102 are not fixed by symmetry arguments , however , the requirement of a stable vacuum in the @xmath8 direction implies that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are @xmath105 and not independent . for expansions about @xmath106",
    ", the absence of tadpoles implies that all terms linear in @xmath8 must cancel : @xmath107      the relationship between @xmath98 and @xmath108 is deduced by an analogue of the goldberger - treiman relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g_signn ] ) : @xmath109    -pole diagram in @xmath47pt@xmath110 for @xmath111 . ]",
    "one - boson exchange combined with large-@xmath60 arguments @xcite leads to the estimate @xmath112 with a large model - dependent uncertainty .",
    "we take the central value and obtain @xmath113 100 mev .      from @xmath114",
    "we obtain the dilaton mass @xmath115 and the effective @xmath116 coupling @xmath117 note the key feature of ( [ eqn : gspipi ] ) : it is mostly derivative so it has a small effect on @xmath21-scattering in the @xmath118 limit where @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( and thus @xmath121 ) remains fixed .",
    "the vertex for an on - shell amplitude for @xmath122 is readily obtained , @xmath123 and generates part of the broad width for @xmath8 @xmath124 note that @xmath125 and thus nlo in the chiral - scale expansion .      in @xmath47pt@xmath110 ,",
    "the anomalous dimension @xmath127 of @xmath51 differs from that of @xmath128 .",
    "consequently , the chiral - scale lagrangian includes a term @xmath129 whose @xmath8 dependence can not be eliminated by a chiral rotation .",
    "instead , after vacuum alignment , the weak interactions are described in the lo of @xmath10 by @xmath130 noting that @xmath131 represents quark - gluon operators with differing dimensions at @xmath132 . as a result , @xmath133 and @xmath8 mix through the interaction @xmath134 , where the effective coupling @xmath135 produces a @xmath136 amplitude @xmath137 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : k_pipi ] ) .     for @xmath126 .",
    "the dominant @xmath8-pole implies that the couplings @xmath138 and @xmath139 are allowed to be of similar magnitudes . ]",
    "the value of this coupling can be fixed by data on @xmath140 and @xmath141 , with the result @xmath142 accurate to about 30% precision .",
    "subject to the uncertainty on @xmath143 , we estimate @xmath144 thereby accounting for the large @xmath145 amplitude @xmath146 in ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are allowed to have similar magnitudes ( with the latter fixed precisely by @xmath147 ) and thus the octet dominance hypothesis is no longer necessary to explain the @xmath16 rule .",
    "another welcome feature of @xmath10 is that is makes a _ nonperturbative _ prediction for the drell - yan ratio @xmath148 at @xmath149 .",
    "this is so because the electromagnetic trace anomaly @xcite @xmath150 implies an effective @xmath151 coupling @xmath152 here @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the electromagnetic field strength and fine - structure constant . through direct calculation , ( [ eqn : l_sig2gam ] ) can be shown to be @xcite @xmath155 dispersive analyses @xcite of @xmath13 indicate that the residue of the @xmath82 pole can be unambiguously extracted from data . within the uncertainty in the value of @xmath98 ,",
    "we use the updated value @xcite @xmath156 to obtain @xmath157",
    "we have seen that an infrared fixed point in the three flavor @xmath62-function of qcd leads to an extended ng sector @xmath158 , where the @xmath9 resonance is identified with @xmath8 as the dilaton of spontaneously broken scale symmetry . despite a seemingly drastic change to the accepted low - energy structure of qcd ,",
    "the resulting chiral - scale perturbation theory @xmath10 is rather conservative : @xmath82 pole terms are promoted to leading order in @xmath10 ( thereby evading @xmath33 s convergence problems in the @xmath79 channel ) , yet the successful leading order predictions of @xmath33 are preserved . while our key result is a simple explanation for the @xmath0 rule in @xmath1-decays , @xmath10 is certainly a general framework and it would be interesting to examine the consequences of the effective theory for other well studied conundrums such as @xmath159-violation , rare kaon decays , and @xmath160 .",
