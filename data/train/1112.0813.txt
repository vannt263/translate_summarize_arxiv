    "the cubically nonlinear @xmath20 lifespan of smooth solutions for the burgers - hilbert equation is longer than the quadratically nonlinear @xmath21 lifespan for the inviscid burgers equation @xmath22 .",
    "the explanation of this enhanced lifespan is that the quadratically nonlinear term of the order @xmath3 in ( [ bheq ] ) is nonresonant for the linearized equation . to see this , note that the solution of the linearized equation @xmath23 $ ]",
    "is given by @xmath24 , or @xmath25,\\ ] ] as may be verified by use of the identity @xmath26 .",
    "this solution oscillates with frequency one between the initial data and its hilbert transform , and the effect of the nonlinear forcing term @xmath27 on the linearized equation averages to zero because it contains no fourier component in time whose frequency is equal to one .",
    "alternatively , one can view the averaging of the nonlinearity as a consequence of the fact that the nonlinear steepening of the profile in one phase of the oscillation is canceled by its expansion in the other phase .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated by numerical results from @xcite , which are reproduced in figure  [ u_sing ] .",
    "the transition from an @xmath21 lifespan for large @xmath3 to an @xmath20 lifespan for small @xmath3 is remarkably rapid : once a singularity fails to form over the first oscillation in time , a smooth solution typically persists over many oscillations .     for the burgers - hilbert equation ( [ bheq ] ) versus the logarithm of @xmath28 for fixed initial data @xmath4 .",
    "numerical solutions are shown by diamonds .",
    "the steeper line is a formal asymptotic prediction from @xcite for @xmath29 , which gives @xmath30 .",
    "the shallower line is the singularity formation time for the inviscid burgers equation , which gives @xmath31 .",
    "( see @xcite for further details.),width=384 ]    in the context of the motion of a vorticity discontinuity , the formation of a singularity in a solution of ( [ bheq ] ) corresponds to the filamentation of the discontinuity @xcite .",
    "the result proved here corresponds to an enhanced lifespan before nonlinear ` breaking ' of the discontinuity leads to the formation of a filament .",
    "there are three main difficulties in the proof of theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "the first is that the presence of a quadratically nonlinear term in ( [ bheq ] ) means that straightforward energy estimates prove the existence of smooth solutions only on time - scales of the order @xmath32 .",
    "following the idea introduced by shatah @xcite in the context of pdes , and used subsequently by other authors , we remove the quadratically nonlinear term of the order @xmath3 by a normal form or near - identity transformation , replacing it by a cubically nonlinear term of the order @xmath33 .",
    "the second difficulty is that a standard normal form transformation of the dependent variable , of the type used by shatah , leads to a loss of spatial derivatives because we are using a lower - order linear term @xmath34 $ ] to eliminate a higher - order nonlinear term @xmath35 .",
    "the third difficulty is that ( [ bheq ] ) is nondispersive and solutions of the linearized equation oscillate but do not decay in time .",
    "thus , we can not use any dispersive decay in time to control the loss of spatial derivatives .",
    "the key idea in this paper that avoids these difficulties is to make a transformation of the independent variable , rather than the dependent variable .",
    "we write @xmath36(t , x;{\\epsilon } ) \\label{defh}\\ ] ] and define @xmath37 then , as we will show , the transformed function @xmath38 satisfies an integro - differential equation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a smooth function , given in lemma  [ lemma : geq ] .",
    "the term of the order @xmath3 has been removed from ( [ g - eq ] ) , and the equation has good energy estimates that imply the enhanced lifespan of smooth solutions .",
    "the interpretation of the transformation ( [ nearid_trans ] ) is not entirely clear .",
    "on taking the hilbert transform of ( [ bheq ] ) we get @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 thus the transformation @xmath43 in ( [ nearid_trans ] ) agrees up to the order @xmath3 with a transformation from characteristic to spatial coordinates for ( [ bheq ] ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath44 , however , differs from @xmath45 even when @xmath46 , and the use of characteristic coordinates does not appear to simplify the analysis . as a partial motivation for ( [ nearid_trans ] ) ,",
    "we show in section  [ sec : normal_form ] that it agrees to leading order in @xmath3 with a normal form transformation of the dependent variable that is given in @xcite .",
    "we were not able , however , to use the latter normal form transformation to prove theorem  [ th : main ] because of the loss of derivatives in the higher - order terms .",
    "we consider ( [ bheq ] ) on the real line for simplicity .",
    "equation ( [ bheq ] ) is nondispersive and solutions of the linearized equation oscillate in time .",
    "thus , our proof does not depend on any dispersive decay of the solutions in time , and a similar result would apply to spatially periodic solutions .",
    "theorem  [ th : main ] is also presumably true in @xmath47 for any @xmath48 ; we consider @xmath49 to avoid complications associated with the use of fractional derivatives .",
    "a proof of singularity formation for ( [ bheq ] ) under certain conditions on @xmath4 and @xmath3 is given in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "it follows from standard energy arguments ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) that ( [ bheq ] ) has a unique local @xmath50-solution in a time - interval @xmath51 depending on the @xmath50-norm of the initial data and @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath52 , the solution remains in @xmath47 if the initial data is in @xmath47 and depends continuously on the initial data in @xmath53 .",
    "thus , in order to prove theorem  [ th : main ] it is sufficient to prove an _ a priori _ @xmath50-bound for smooth solutions @xmath54 where @xmath55 . to derive this bound , we first transform the equation to remove the order @xmath3 term and then carry out @xmath50-estimates on the transformed equation .",
    "the required computations , such as integrations by parts , are justified for these smooth solutions .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the hilbert transform of @xmath57 , as in ( [ defh ] ) .",

    "the map @xmath43 is smoothly invertible if @xmath61 , which holds by sobolev embedding if @xmath62 is sufficiently small .",
    "specifically , we have the gagliardo - nirenberg - moser inequality @xmath63 where we can take , for example , @xmath64 we assume throughout this section that @xmath65 which ensures that @xmath66    by the chain rule , @xmath67 thus , if ( [ cinftysmall ] ) holds , then @xmath68 hence , since @xmath2 is an isometry on @xmath47 , @xmath69 and @xmath50-estimates for @xmath70 imply @xmath50-estimates for @xmath57 .",
