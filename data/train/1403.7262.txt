    "topological effects in periodically driven systems are by now a subject of considerable theoretical and experimental interest @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this interest is that driving fields offer an easy way of tuning a system s topological properties , unlike the case for static systems in which their topological properties are for most intents and purposes fixed during the fabrication process .",
    "this fact was first theoretically demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a system was tuned from being topologically trivial to non - trivial by means of a driving field , forming a floquet topological insulator ( fti ) .",
    "recently , this effect has also been theoretically demonstrated in graphene @xcite .",
    "there are also various interesting effects which are peculiar to driven systems , of which we name only a few for brevity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "firstly , driven systems can host two types of edge modes with zero group velocity .",
    "these are the @xmath1 or @xmath2 quasienergy edge modes @xcite , whereas static systems can only give rise to zero - energy edge modes .",
    "secondly , driven systems allow for the generation of floquet majorana modes @xcite which are described by different invariants @xcite than their static counterparts and may in theory be generated in large number simply by increasing the period of the driving field @xcite .",
    "thirdly , driving fields have been proposed as a means of achieving a semimetal - insulator phase transition in graphene @xcite . to understand these driving - induced effects , general theoretical frameworks for solving driven lattice systems",
    "have been proposed in refs .",
    "fourthly , driving fields have also been found to induce anomalous counter - propagating ( acp ) chiral edge modes in lattice systems @xcite , which are currently not well understood theoretically ( see below for details ) .",
    "most recently , a driving field - induced spin hall effect has been theoretically proposed @xcite .    along a separate vein ,",
    "the subject of weak topological insulators ( wtis ) is also an area of ongoing research activity @xcite .",
    "wtis are mostly spoken of in the context of three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems @xcite .",
    "these phases are ` weak ' for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the edge modes of wtis only exist along certain boundaries ( i.e. , it depends on the shape one cuts out from an infinite lattice to obtain a finite sample and also on which boundary of the sample one looks at ) , in contrast to the situation for strong topological insulators ( sti ) , in which edge modes always exist on the boundary regardless of its shape and direction . secondly , wtis are in general not stable in the same way that stis are , because they are associated with invariants in a lower dimensionality than that of the physical system .",
    "it was first thought that because coupling the two - dimensional ( 2d ) layers of a 3d wti system in pairs renders them topologically trivial@xcite , wtis are no more interesting than topologically trivial insulators .",
    "however , it was pointed out in several papers @xcite that random disorder , which is unlike the coherent pair - wise coupling mentioned above , is insufficient for localizing all the edge states .",
    "also , several papers showed that the lower - dimensional topological effects can manifest as protected conducting channels at dislocations @xcite or ` terrace - structures ' @xcite in 3d lattices .",
    "in other words , wtis display topological effects because the lower - dimensional topological non - triviality survives even in the higher dimension . recently , there has been an interest in wtis in the context of 2d systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced topological numbers which demonstrate the bulk - boundary correspondence of 2d wtis , while ref .",
    "@xcite studied the 1-dimensional ( 1d)-2d transition in topological behavior of a square lattice as it is gradually built up from stacking 1d chains atop one another .",
    "along another line of work , it is also known that chiral symmetry gives rise to interesting topological zero modes and dirac points in graphene.@xcite    the present work studies weak topological effects in chiral symmetric driven systems , making it relevant to all the three themes above- namely ftis , wtis and chiral symmetry .",
    "we study these effects in the context of two topologically non - trivial driven 2d models .",
    "these are lattice versions of the kicked harper model ( khm ) @xcite ( this was regarded as a kicked quantum hall system in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and an on - resonance double - kicked rotor ( ordkr ) model @xcite . we chose to study these two models because their eigenstates are related by a precise 1 - 1 correspondence which ensures that their chern numbers ( when computable ) must be equal @xcite ( see sec .",
    "iii for details ) .",
    "this guaranteed equality of chern numbers suggests that any differences in topological edge state behaviour seen in the two models is not directly related with the chern numbers , making this a good opportunity to study weak topological behaviour . in this work ,",
    "we study these weak topological properties analytically and numerically .",
    "it is our hope that this work motivates further investigations into weak topological effects in driven systems , an area which is still unexplored and might thus contain new physics .",
    "we briefly summarize the contributions of this work as follows .",
    "the number of floquet bands in these models may be tuned by one s choice of experimental parameters .",
    "when an odd number of bands are present , the bands chern numbers @xcite successfully predict the net number of chiral modes within each quasienergy gap according to the usual bulk - boundary correspondence rule @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ 3band - section ] for details ) .",
    "however , there also occur in both models anomalous counter - propagating ( acp ) modes@xcite whose existence can not be predicted from the chern numbers .",
    "these acp modes were first discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the lattice khm under a particular choice of boundary condition ( bc ) .",
    "our work here builds on their finding in two ways .",
    "firstly , we identify the existence of these modes in several other instances- namely under different bcs and also in a totally separate model in the form of the ordkr lattice .",
    "secondly , we show that these modes are in fact a weak topological effect and show results suggesting that they are related to the particular form of chiral symmetry ( cs ) operator describing the system . moving on to consider an even number of bands , we report the existence of topologically protected @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy modes in the ordkr model but not in the khm",
    ". these modes only occur along open bcs along one dimension but not along the other dimension .",
    "we show that they are in fact governed by 1d topological invariants @xcite , demonstrating that they are once again a manifestation of a weak topological effect .",
    "the existence of these 1d invariants is again tied back to the particular form of cs operator .",
    "our numerics also reveal that as certain parameters of the ordkr model are tuned up , a large number of these topological edge modes occurs , together with a proliferation of dirac cones in the quasienergy spectrum .",
    "this finding may be useful for quantum information processing with floquet majorana modes@xcite and the study of dirac cones@xcite .",
    "so far as we know , this paper is the first to consider weak topological effects in driven systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce briefly the khm and the ordkr models , originally discussed in the quantum chaos literature and typically addressed in the angular momentum representation . to study their edge state behaviour",
    ", we introduce 2d lattice versions of these two models , which we refer to as the kicked harper lattice ( khl ) and the double kicked lattice ( dkl ) models , respectively .",
    "these lattice versions are mathematically identical to the original khm and ordkr ( due to the equivalence between the lattice sites representation and the angular momentum representation ) but are physically more meaningful . to lay the groundwork for later sections , we analyse the symmetries of the two models on a general level in sec .  iii . in secs .",
    "iv and v , we specialize to 3-band and 2-band cases respectively in both models and study their weak topological edge state behaviour along different boundaries .",
    "the 3-band and 2-band cases are typical examples of odd - band and even - band behaviour in our driven systems .",
    "we point out the relationships between these topological states and the symmetries as well as bulk topological invariants present in the models .",
    "we conclude in sec .  vi .",
    "for completeness , we give a brief introduction to the background of the khm and the ordkr models which are both well - studied in the context of quantum chaos .",
    "we note in passing that a very recent study @xcite has argued that topological phenomena may emerge as a result of chaos , thus suggesting that the two seemingly disparate topics of chaos and topological insulators may even be related in a fundamental way",
    ".    the khm displays chaos ( given a suitable choice of parameters ) when treated classically , yet its quantum version is simple enough for accurate numerical study .",
    "insights on many topics have been gained from studies of this model .",
    "such topics include metal - insulator transitions @xcite and quantum eigenstate topology @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the khm displays an unusual fractal - like quasienergy spectrum due to its close connection @xcite with the famous hofstadter butterfly spectrum @xcite .",
    "the ordkr model is a particular example of modulated kicked rotors @xcite and is another classically chaotic model which has yielded interesting features quantum mechanically .",
    "it displays intriguing features such as ratchet acceleration @xcite and exponential quantum spreading @xcite .",
    "this model has close connections with the khm . under an appropriate choice of parameters",
    ", the ordkr also displays a hofstadter - like quasienergy spectrum analogous to that of the khm while at the same time displaying qualitatively different dynamics @xcite .",
    "subsequent work @xcite found that the spectra of the two models are identical provided that either an effective planck constant parameter is irrational or a union of spectra over an added phase shift parameter ( as we shall see later , this phase shift parameter may be regarded as the crystal momentum along the second dimension of a 2d model ) is taken in both models .",
    "the vast literature on khm and our earlier studies of the ordkr are based on the angular momentum representation , with both models displaying continuous floquet bands due to a translational invariance in the angular momentum space .",
    "this is not appropriate for the investigation of topological edge states because it is not clear how to introduce a physical boundary in the angular momentum space .",
    "for that reason we consider instead lattice versions of ordkr and khm .",
    "originally both khm and ordkr were 1d dynamical models .",
    "however , to study weak topological effects , we shall investigate 2d generalized versions of these two models .",
    "in particular , we start with a 2d square lattice of @xmath3 sites , with both open and periodic boundary conditions along @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the discrete lattice sites along @xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary state in the hilbert space is then written as @xmath9 .",
    "the first model we consider is a double - kicked lattice ( dkl ) model @xcite , a lattice version of ordkr , described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the above hamiltonian describes a time - periodic protocol consisting of four stages per period . during the first stage ,",
    "the hamiltonian describes a particle undergoing hopping in a diagonal fashion on the lattice . in the second stage ,",
    "the particle is subject to a potential of strength @xmath13 which is quadratic along @xmath4 and independent of @xmath5 .",
    "next , the particle experiences a nearest - neighbour hopping of strength @xmath14 along only the @xmath4-direction . finally , the particle experiences again the same potential that is quadratic along @xmath4 , except with negative strength @xmath15 , meaning that this parabolic potential is inverted relative to the earlier one .",
    "the consideration of a finite lattice ( i.e. , open boundary conditions ) will reveal edge state properties , whereas applying periodic boundary conditions will reveal the bulk spectrum .",
    "for the latter purpose , we may obtain a compact form of the floquet operator for the dkl by introducing the translationally invariant crystal momentum states , defined by @xmath16 along @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . using the above equation",
    ", one may show that the floquet operator which propagates from @xmath20 to @xmath21 takes the form @xmath22 where we have chosen to work in dimensionless units such that @xmath23 . within each @xmath24 subspace",
    ", the above @xmath25 is seen to be of precisely the same form as the floquet operator of a 1d ordkr treated in the angular momentum space @xcite , where @xmath26 plays the role of the angular momentum operator , @xmath27 the role of an angular variable , and @xmath24 the role of a phase shift parameter .",
    "a similar perspective was discussed by others @xcite where the 2d model was referred to as the  ancestor \" of 1d models within each @xmath24 subspace .    throughout",
    ", we denote the quasienergy and the associated eigenstate of a floquet operator @xmath28 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively @xcite , with @xmath31 .",
    "since the quasienergy is only defined modulo @xmath32 , we define the quasienergy brillouin zone ( bz ) as ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath2 . by choosing @xmath13 such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , the floquet operator @xmath25 becomes periodic in the @xmath36 representation with period @xmath37 .",
    "bloch s theorem then yields that we will have a quasienergy spectrum consisting of @xmath37 bands . for low values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the spectrum consists of @xmath37 bands separated by large gaps . for a fixed value of @xmath13 , increasing the values of @xmath38 will cause the quasienergy bands to broaden and occupy more space within the quasienergy bz . as @xmath38 increase beyond certain special values",
    ", the quasienergy bands will touch and re - separate , possibly causing a topological phase transition .",
    "later , we shall study the spectra obtained as @xmath38 increase for different @xmath39 and observe the effects that the topological phase transitions have on the topological invariants and related edge states .",
    "here we consider a lattice version of khm , which we refer to as the kicked harper lattice ( khl ) , described by hamiltonian @xmath40 with @xmath12 , where we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ fourier - trans ] ) in order to obtain the second line that applies to the case under periodic boundary condition ( for the purpose of understanding the bulk spectrum ) .",
    "the above hamiltonian is directly related to a solid - state system subject to a kicking control field and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was called a kicked hall system .",
    "the floquet operator evolving states from time @xmath41 to time @xmath42 is then given by @xmath43 within each single @xmath24 subspace , this is indeed the familiar form of the 1d khm floquet operator , with @xmath24 playing the role of a phase shift parameter as introduced in our early studies @xcite . by choosing @xmath44 , where @xmath35 , we again obtain an @xmath37-band quasienergy spectrum just like we did for the dkl floquet operator .",
    "this completes our construction of the lattice versions of ordkr and khm .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that given a floquet operator @xmath45 , assuming that there is no winding of quasienergy across the bz seen in the spectrum ( i.e. , the quasienergy spectrum remains between @xmath33 and @xmath2 at all points in the bz ) , one may extract an effective static hamiltonian , @xmath46 , via the relation @xmath47 and classify @xmath46 according to the tenfold classification scheme for static systems @xcite , thus effectively classifying @xmath45 . following this approach ,",
    "a floquet operator @xmath45 is said to possesses chiral symmetry ( cs ) @xcite if there exists a unitary and hermitian operator @xmath48 such that @xmath49 with @xmath48 obeying @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath48 as the cs operator .",
    "an ambiguity naturally arises at this point .",
    "namely , there is an arbitrary choice of which one - period time interval to choose for a floquet operator to propagate across .",
    "it turns out that different choices can lead to @xmath46 possessing different symmetries or none at all .",
    "we follow the strategy introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and seek  symmetric time frames \" , which are defined as choices of time frames resulting in floquet operators @xmath45 of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are unitary operators related with each other via the cs operator : @xmath54 it is trivial to prove that once this relation is obeyed , so too is the cs condition in eq .",
    "( [ cs - condtn ] ) .",
    "such symmetric time frames do not exist for arbitrary floquet operators but do in the case of the dkl and khl , as we shall prove shortly .",
    "it is easy to see that if a symmetric time frame exists corresponding to a floquet operator @xmath55 exists , then there must also be a second symmetric time frame corresponding to floquet operator @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we note for general interest that floquet operators possessing cs in symmetric time frames in general do _ not _ obey cs in arbitrary ( non - symmetric ) time frames .",
    "this fact hints at the existence of some generalized form of chiral symmetry which is present regardless of the choice of time frame .",
    "if such a generalization exists , it has yet to be found , but we do not tackle this issue in the present work .      the floquet operator for the dkl model in a symmetric time frame from @xmath57 to @xmath58 ( cf .",

    ", we elaborate upon the 1 - 1 mapping between the two models that we alluded to in the introduction . in ref .",

    "we shall see in the following sections that this rearrangement does not affect the system s strong topological properties ( i.e. , boundary shape - independent edge modes described by 2d invariants ) , but gives rise to differences which turn out to be weak topological properties ( i.e. , boundary shape - dependent edge modes described by 1d invariants ) .",

    "[ khm - lattice-3band](a ) , ( c ) and ( e)@xcite . as pointed out by these authors , under certain parameter choices ( see figs . [ khm - lattice-3band](c ) and ( e ) ) , acp modes appear within certain gaps . to be precise",

    "we note that by ` systems ' , we refer to both static and driven systems whose hamiltonians and effective hamiltonians respectively are found in class a @xcite and by ` bands ' , we refer to both energy and quasienergy bands .",
    "it is known@xcite that in such systems , taking open bcs along one direction and keeping periodic bcs along the other ( perpendicular ) direction ( i.e. , a cylinder geometry ) , for any band @xmath118 , the net chirality of edge modes ( i.e. , the total count of chiral modes signed according to their chirality ) on each boundary in the gap above it subtracted by the same in the gap below it must be equal to the band s chern number calculated under periodic bcs .",

    ". in a dramatic example , these authors showed that a system whose bands all possess zero chern number is still able to host topological chiral edge modes .",
    "to remedy this ambiguity , they formulated a bulk winding number invariant that uniquely determines the net chirality of edge states in each gap . in the absence of acp modes ,",

    "we point out that by increasing @xmath199 and @xmath191 here , we are effectively simulating a static hamiltonian with long - range hopping@xcite . to see this , note the effective hamiltonian is defined via @xmath213 the floquet operator is given by the concatenation of four exponential operators as seen in eq .",
    "( [ lattice - uordkr - ky ] )",
    ". each exponential operator does not commute with the exponential operator on either side of it .",
    "hence , in order to obtain @xmath46 , one must apply the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula to each pair of adjacent exponential operators repeatedly until we finally are left with only one exponential operator .",
    "now , by making use of the bch formula , we see that given three arbitrary operators @xmath214 and @xmath215 related via @xmath216 where @xmath217 are c - numbers , the operator @xmath215 is given by @xmath218 - \\frac{c_{1}c_{2}}{12}[c_{1}\\hat{x}-c_{2}\\hat{y},[\\hat{x},\\hat{y } ] ] + \\cdots \\hspace{1mm}.\\ ] ] due to the infinite series of nested commutators of @xmath219 and @xmath220 , we see that @xmath215 may contain terms of longer - range hopping than those present in both @xmath219 and @xmath220 individually .",
    "the larger the values of @xmath221 and @xmath222 , the more nested commutator terms will play a significant role in @xmath215 . applying this in the context of the problem at hand ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath46 will contain longer - range hopping terms beyond the nearest - neighbour hopping terms seen in eq .",
    "( [ ldr2d ] ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath199 and @xmath191 will then lead to longer - range hopping in @xmath46 . as we saw earlier",
    ", the floquet operator of the dkl model possesses cs regardless of the values of @xmath199 and @xmath191 .",
    "hence , by increasing these values , we are able to simulate an effective chiral symmetric hamiltonian with very long - range hopping .",
    "as mentioned earlier , increasing @xmath199 and @xmath191 is achieved simply by prolonging the ` hopping ' part of the period .    summarizing this section ,",
    "we have found that , despite the existence of a mapping between the dkl and khl models , they possess different topological behaviour in the two - band cases as well .",
    "namely , the dkl possesses weak floquet topological edge states but the khl does not .",
    "these results reinforce the observation from the three - band cases investigated in sec .",
    "iv . that is",
    ", a re - arrangement of eigenstates in the crystal momentum bz can create or destroy weak topological effects .",
    "we have also found that the 2-band dkl is able to host a large number of topological modes while at the same time generating a large number of dirac cones in a manner which is experimentally appealing .",
    "we have studied two chiral symmetric driven 2d quantum systems and demonstrated theoretically that they host weak topological edge states . in the 3-band cases , we found in both models that anomalous counter - propagating ( acp ) chiral edge modes exist only along certain boundaries and persist over a wide parameter range , thus suggesting that these are a weak topological effect .",
    "if this is the case , there ought to exist a weak topological invariant associated with their existence . at the time of writing ,",
    "such an invariant has yet to be discovered .",
    "our results suggest that a crucial ingredient for the topological protection of these acp modes is the existence of a chiral symmetry ( cs ) operator which maps each floquet operator in momentum space at crystal momentum @xmath97 onto its inverse at @xmath135 @xcite , where @xmath97 here denotes a generic crystal momentum variable and the system is studied in a cylinder geometry , meaning that periodic bcs taken along one direction and open bcs along the other .    in the 2-band cases ,",
    "the situation is somewhat reversed .",
    "the existence of a cs operator transforming each momentum space floquet operator at @xmath97 into the inverse of that at @xmath135 does not protect the existence of edge modes .",
    "instead , the existence of a cs operator mapping each floquet operator at @xmath97 onto its inverse at the same @xmath97 is required to topologically protect edge modes .",
    "we have also found that an arbitrarily large number of topological @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy edge modes may be generated by simply increasing the duration of the hopping stages within each time period of the 2-band dkl hamiltonian .",
    "these modes could be useful for future quantum information applications @xcite .",
    "finally , we also showed that this gives rise to a proliferation of dirac cones in the quasienergy spectrum , a finding which may be useful for simulating static chiral - symmetric hamiltonians with many dirac cones .",
    "we have also emphasized that the floquet eigenstates of the two dynamical models studied in this work have an interesting correspondence and hence differ ( up to a unitary transformation ) in their arrangement on the bz .",
    "both our 3-band and 2-band results ( as prototypical representatives of the even - band and odd - band cases ) indicate that weak topological effects depend not just on the nature of the set of eigenstates associated with a physical system , but also on the arrangement of these states on the bz .    for possible experimental realizations of our findings here ,",
    "we note that photonic setups are increasingly establishing themselves as a versatile setup for simulating topological quantum phases @xcite .",
    "another possible avenue to consider would be optical lattice setups @xcite .",
    "we note that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the 3-band khl model may possibly be realized by making use of artificial magnetic field techniques @xcite or by introducing complex tunnelling amplitudes via shaking an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the anomalous counter - propagating modes may be identified using the momentum - resolved photoemission spectroscopy method of ref .",
    "@xcite which extracts a spectral function which in turn yields information on the number of states present for each energy and each momentum .    on the computational side ,",
    "it is straightforward to extend our consideration to cases with more bands .",
    "we have carried out calculations for cases with many floquet bands and these suggest that the observations made in this work regarding the difference between dkl and khl still hold .",
    "that is , if the number of bands is even , then there exist many edge modes with 0 or @xmath2 quasienergy values in the former model ( dkl ) but not in the latter ( khl ) ; and if the number of bands is odd , there exist acp chiral edge modes only in cases where the cs is of type ii mentioned under eqs .",
    "( [ khl - cs - obc - ky]-[dkl - cs - obc - kx ] ) .",
    "the dkl model for multiple band cases also shows both flat @xmath1 quasienergy modes as well as chiral modes , similar to those seen in the static context of ref .",
    "@xcite . throughout this work ,",
    "we have also viewed the system in a strictly stroboscopic manner . to be more precise",
    ", one may instead view the system continuously in time @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our stroboscopic treatment here should however be a fairly accurate representation of the physics , as our floquet operators are both local in nature and do not transmit wavepackets over infinite distances within each period .",
    "our results indicate that our observation here that the particular form of cs operator has a huge impact on the edge states is quite general . in future",
    ", it would be also interesting to study the implications of the particular form of other symmetry operators besides cs operators , such as time - reversal or particle - hole symmetry operators .",
    "we provide some mathematical details regarding the topological protection of the edge modes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy values in the 2-band dkl model under open bcs along @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the 2-band dkl floquet operator under this bc simply as @xmath166 for brevity . on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy subspaces , @xmath165 and @xmath166 commute .",
    "this is easily seen as follows .",
    "firstly , @xmath223 due to the cs condition .",
    "since any @xmath1 or @xmath2 quasienergy eigenstate of @xmath166 is also an eigenstate of @xmath167 with the same eigenvalue , @xmath165 and @xmath166 thus commute within the @xmath171 and @xmath2 subspaces .",
    "the commutation enables us to choose the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy states to be common eigenstates of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "note that because @xmath224 , its only possible eigenvalues are @xmath225 .",
    "this allows us to define two sublattices @xcite denoted @xmath150 and @xmath151 , with projectors @xmath226 and @xmath227 respectively ( i.e. , sublattice a ( b ) consists of all the even ( odd ) sites ) .",
    "each @xmath1 or @xmath2 quasienergy state then resides entirely on one lattice only .",
    "we denote such eigenstates as @xmath228 , where @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 is an index to label different states in the event that we have multiple eigenstates with the same quasienergy and same sublattice index @xmath232 .",
    "now , assume that at some @xmath24 , we happen to have a number of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy states .",
    "suppose we perturb the system in a way which preserves the chiral symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ cs - dkl ] ) .",
    "we may regard this increase as adding a cs - preserving perturbation to the original @xmath233 , defined by @xmath234 .",
    "we denote this perturbation as @xmath235 . by definition of preservation of cs",
    ", it must be true that the anti - commutator @xmath236 vanishes .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the following anti - commutator matrix element , @xmath237 this tells us that , within the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy subspaces respectively , a cs - preserving perturbation @xmath235 can only mix edge states living on different sublattices .",
    "this implies that the difference between the number of @xmath1 modes on the @xmath150 and @xmath151 sublattices must remain unchanged so long as the quasienergy gap remains open @xcite .",
    "since varying @xmath24 by a small amount in @xmath238 may be regarded as a cs - preserving perturbation , we expect to see @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy states persist over a range of @xmath24 values so long as no gap - closing occurs .",
    "this is indeed seen in figs .",
    "[ ordkr - vs - khm-2bands](a ) and [ ordkr - lattice-2band ] .",
    "we remind that the above analysis does not apply to the 2-band khl model because the starting point of the analysis , which is the presence of cs in its floquet operator @xmath169 under open bcs along @xmath4 , does not hold .",
    "this is the reason for the big difference in edge states between the 2-band dkl and khl .",

    "<S> recent years have seen a strong interest in topological effects within periodically driven systems . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we explore topological effects in two closely related 2-dimensional driven systems described by floquet operators possessing chiral symmetry ( cs ) . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical and analytical results suggest the following . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the cs is associated with the existence of the anomalous counter - propagating ( acp ) modes reported recently . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that a particular form of cs protects the acp modes occurring at quasienergies of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that these modes are only present along selected boundaries , suggesting that they are a weak topological effect . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we find that cs can give rise to protected @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasienergy modes , and that the number of these modes may increase without bound as we tune up certain system parameters . like the acp modes </S>",
    "<S> , these @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes also appear only along selected boundaries and thus appear to be a weak topological effect . to our knowledge , this work represents the first detailed study of weak topological effects in periodically driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> our findings add to the still - growing knowledge on driven topological systems . </S>"
