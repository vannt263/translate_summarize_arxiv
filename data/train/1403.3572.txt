    "symmetries , like equivariance and reversibility , play an important role in determining the behavior of a dynamical system .",
    "equivariant symmetries have been studied extensively in connection with bifurcation theory ; see @xcite . the general theory for reversible symmetries in dynamical systems had a more recent development as described in the thorough surveys @xcite .",
    "indeed , symmetries are geometric invariants which play an important role through several applications in physics , from the classical @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite to thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a gap in the literature concerning the area - preserving reversible systems and the question about the validity of classic results in the this setting arises .",
    "the main object of the present paper is twofold : we intend to study dynamical systems which keep invariant a reversing symmetry and a symplectic form at the same time .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the interconnection between these two types of geometrical invariants is much common since there is a large class of hamiltonians which come equipped with a reversing symmetry .",
    "a paradigmatic example relies on the chirikov - taylor standard map @xcite . in the present article , after a scrupulous examination of properly chosen examples , we would like to systematize their features and consider the general family of area - preserving maps which display a reversing symmetry .",
    "the area - preserving maps appear naturally when considering time - one maps of a hamiltonian with @xmath7 degrees of freedom which is the base of celestial and classical mechanics . in what follows",
    ", we characterize the maps that we are going to consider along the paper .",
    "let @xmath2 denote a compact , connected , boundaryless , @xmath8 riemannian two - dimensional manifold , let @xmath9 be a smooth symplectic form on @xmath2 and @xmath10 the measure associated to @xmath9 that we call _ lebesgue measure _ or _",
    "area_. setting by @xmath11 the set of @xmath6 diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 , let @xmath12 stand for the set of @xmath6 diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 such that if @xmath13 , then for every borelian subset @xmath14 of @xmath2 , the following property holds : @xmath15 .",
    "these maps are often called _ area - preserving _",
    "diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath16 is anosov if @xmath2 is a uniformly hyperbolic set for @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ there are @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that , for every @xmath19 , there is a @xmath20-invariant continuous splitting @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "we address the existence of elliptic periodic orbits far from the anosov maps within the space @xmath25 which exhibit some reversing symmetry . roughly speaking , a reversing symmetry is a diffeomorphism @xmath26 such that for all @xmath19 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath29 is called @xmath0-_reversible _ if there exists an isometry @xmath30 , which conjugates @xmath3 to its inverse @xmath31 , _ i.e. _ , such that the following equality holds : @xmath32    the set of diffeomorphisms that are area - preserving and @xmath0-reversible will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the fixed - point subspace of the involution @xmath0 , defined as @xmath34 , is a central object of analysis .",
    "while fixed point subspaces of preserving symmetries are invariant under the dynamics , in general they are not setwise invariant for reversing symmetries . throughout this article , this set is assumed to be a smooth one - dimensional submanifold of @xmath2 .",

    ", the dynamic structure of symplectic maps near an elliptic periodic orbit has been studied intensively in the context of hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "going back in to the seventies , in the generic theory of area - preserving diffeomorphisms , we find the seminal result of newhouse @xcite that says that @xmath6-generic diffeomorphisms in surfaces are anosov or else the elliptical points are dense . the proof is supported in the symplectic structure and on the finding of homoclinic tangencies associated to periodic orbits .",
    "the extension of the newhouse dichotomy for the reversible context is not so straightforward as we may expect due to the technical difficulties that the reversibility entails : there is no guarantee that the construction of the @xmath0-reversible and conservative perturbation , through homoclinic tangencies , may be done in a reversible way .",
    "this is why our proof does not run along the same lines to that of @xcite but rather to those of @xcite .",
    "the present article gives a proof of newhouse s dichotomy in the reversible and area - preserving setting ; we also obtain the abundance of elliptic closed orbits @xmath6-far from the anosov maps and the proof of the stability conjecture for this class .",
    "a consequence of the latter result is that the only symplectic reversible diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold which are structurally stable ( among symplectic reversible diffeomorphisms ) are the anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "anosov diffeomorphisms within the class @xmath33 were studied with detail in  @xcite . in the dissipative context , using the concept of heteroclinic tangencies , the authors of @xcite establish a new type of newhouse domains , in which there is a dense set of diffeomorphisms having simultaneously sinks , sources and elliptic periodic orbits .      in order to extend the dichotomy of @xcite for area - preserving reversible maps , we first state and prove a new version of the @xmath6-closing lemma , one of the classic results in dynamical systems .",
    "this is meant to refer to a bifurcation problem in which there is a recurrent ( or non - wandering ) non - closed orbit .",
    "recall that a point @xmath45 is _ non - wandering _ for @xmath3 if for all neighbourhood @xmath46 of @xmath47 , there exists @xmath37 such that @xmath48 .    by perturbing the original system ,",
    "we obtain a @xmath6-near system that has a periodic orbit passing near the non - wandering point .",

    "we refer the reader to the survey @xcite that consider numerous kinds of closing lemmas . using similar arguments to those of @xcite combined with @xcite , we state and",

    "using some perturbation lemmas that will be developed in section [ perturbation ] , the proof of theorem [ closing ] will be addressed in section [ closinglemma ] . a direct corollary of the reversible @xmath6-closing lemma together and the poincar recurrence theorem is the following :    ( _ general density theorem_)[gdt ] there exists a residual subset @xmath58 such that the closure of the set of hyperbolic or elliptic periodic points of any @xmath59 is the whole manifold @xmath2 .",

    "if @xmath3 is non - anosov , the result says nothing with respect to the existence of elliptic periodic points . in this paper , we are able to prove that if @xmath3 is far from being anosov , thus for any open set @xmath64 and @xmath52 , there exists @xmath65 such that @xmath54 is @xmath55-@xmath6-close to @xmath3 and @xmath54 has an elliptic periodic orbit through @xmath66 .",

    "the proof of theorem [ closing ] is done is section [ closinglemma ] and those of proposition [ newhouse ] , theorems [ newhouse2 ] and [ sc ] are addressed in section [ mains ] .",

    "in this section , we describe precisely the ambient space and properties of the maps under consideration in the article .",
    "we introduce some general features and the property of reversibility for a map on the surface @xmath2 .",
    "we will use the canonical norm of a bounded linear map @xmath14 given by @xmath76 . by darboux s theorem ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.18 ) ) there exists an atlas @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an open subset of @xmath2 , satisfying @xmath79 with @xmath80 . since @xmath2 is compact we can always take an atlas with a finite number of charts , say @xmath81 .",

    "we notice that all the estimates along the present paper are made in using the darboux coordinate charts ( @xcite ) .",

    "the definition of reversibility is algebraic and does not rely on any differentiability property of the diffeomorphism @xmath3 .",
    "note that saying that @xmath3 is @xmath0-reversible means that @xmath0 conjugates @xmath3 and @xmath31 .",
