    "we thus suggest that the gas component is inflowing toward complex  1 .",

    ". such a large - scale shock can be caused by a kinematic factor rather than by star formation .",
    "it is likely that the emission of the shock tracers comes from multiple sites of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "in addition , we estimate the number density of outflows which would be required to reproduce the observed ch@xmath2oh intensity in the nuclear region of ngc  4038 , using the ch@xmath2oh luminosity measured in the blue lobe of l1157 . the same discussion has been conducted using the sio emission by @xcite .",
    "the mean ch@xmath2oh intensity in ngc  4038 is 5.55  mjy  km  s@xmath10 , which corresponds to 1.60  k  km  s@xmath10 . according to @xcite , the ch@xmath2oh luminosity is 0.50  k  km  s@xmath10  pc@xmath31 in the blue lobe of l1157 .",
    "thus the required number density of outflows is estimated to be 3.2 outflows pc@xmath39 . although star - forming regions with a few outflows pc@xmath39 are found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unlikely that such star - forming regions is forming across a few 100  pc@xmath31 .",
    "this is the same conclusion as the previous study towards ic  342 @xcite .    finally , we discuss shock strength using the ch@xmath2oh / sio and hnco / sio line ratios .",
    "the ch@xmath2oh / sio line ratio is used as an indicator of shock strength because the ch@xmath2oh molecules could be destroyed by relatively slow shocks ( @xmath40 @xmath7 1015  km  s@xmath10 ) and the dissociation of the sio molecules would require fast shocks ( @xmath40 @xmath7 5060  km  s@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "the hnco / sio line ratio can be also an indicator of shock strength because the hnco molecules could be sublimated by weak shocks @xcite .",
    "we estimate the lower limits of the ch@xmath2oh / sio and hnco / sio line ratios in the nuclear region of ngc  4038 , using the 3@xmath13 upper limit of the sio flux density ( 5.4  mjy  beam@xmath10 ) .",
    "the lower limits of the ch@xmath2oh / sio and hnco / sio peak intensity ratios are 2.0 and 1.9 , respectively . these are comparable to the line ratios measured in in both the young bipolar outflow l1157 and the circum - nuclear disk of ngc  1068 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that fast shocks may have occurred in the nuclear region of ngc  4038 .",
    "however , if the sio emission is much weaker than the 3@xmath13 upper limit , the line ratios become larger , indicating that a possibility for the presence of fast shocks is reduced .",
    "high - sensitivity sio measurements are required to draw a conclusion about the shock strength in the nuclear region of ngc 4038 .",
    "we have conducted multi - line observations ( @xmath24 = 3  mm ) of ngc  4038 using alma .",
    "five molecules ( cn , hcn , hco@xmath1 , ch@xmath2oh , and hnco ) were detected in the central @xmath81  kpc region , and three ( cn , ch@xmath2oh , and hnco ) of them was detected for the first time in this region .",
    "the flux profiles as a function of the distance from the co  ( 32 ) peak reveal the systematic differences in distributions of the different molecular species and continuum emission . a star forming region identified by the free - free emission ( the 3  mm continuum emission ) and the most active site of dusty star forming region ( the 850  @xmath3 m continuum emission ) are located @xmath6100  pc and @xmath650  pc , respectively , south of the hcn  ( 10 ) and co  ( 32 ) peaks .",
    "the cn  ( 10)/hcn  ( 10 ) line ratios are enhanced ( cn / hcn @xmath4 0.81.2 ) in these star forming regions , suggesting the presence of pdrs . assuming the co  ( 32)/co  ( 10 ) line ratio of 0.6 , the average hcn  ( 10)/co  ( 10 ) luminosity ratio is estimated to be 0.08 @xmath21 0.03 .",
    "this corresponds to the dense gas fraction of 17% @xmath21 8% .",
    "the large molecular gas mass ( 10@xmath36  @xmath9 ) and high dense gas fraction ( @xmath720% ) are found around the co peak , which suggests potential star formation there .",
    "the detection of the shocked gas traced in the ch@xmath2oh and hnco emission is evidence for sub - kpc scale molecular shocks .",
    "the distribution of the hnco is slightly different from the ch@xmath2oh distribution .",
    "the ch@xmath2oh emission is detected in a region associated with high ( @xmath370.8 ) cn / hcn line ratios .",
    "since the cn / hcn line ratio is a tracer of pdr , the different distributions of ch@xmath2oh and hnco could be caused by the stellar uv field . comparing the distributions of the shocked gas and the co",
    "( 32 ) emission , we suggest that the molecular shocks could be caused by collision between inflowing gas and the central massive molecular complex .    this paper has made use of the following alma data : ads / jao.alma#2012.0.01000.s and alma science verification data : ads / jao.alma#2011.0.00003.sv .",
