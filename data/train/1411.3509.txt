    "statistical thermodynamics of simple liquids and their mixtures has been extensively studied , and thermodynamical and structural properties of such systems are well understood  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an accurate equation of state of the lennard - jones fluid has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "the impressive development of the theory was possible thanks to the key contributors including prof .",
    "tomas boublik and prof .",
    "ivo nezbeda .",
    "in contrast , the statistical thermodynamics of the so called soft matter systems is much less developed , and recently these systems draw increasing attention .",
    "complex molecules , nanoparticles , colloid particles or polymers in various solvents interact with effective potentials that may have quite different forms . when the shape of the effective potential resembles the shape of interactions between atoms or simple molecules , then analogs of the gas - liquid and liquid - solid transitions occur  @xcite . if , however , there are competing tendencies in the interactions , then instead of the gas - liquid transition or separation of the components , a self - assembly or a microsegregation may be observed  @xcite .",
    "the competing interactions can have quite different origin and form .",
    "one important example of competing interactions is the so called short - range attraction ( sa ) , and long - range repulsion ( lr ) salr potential  @xcite , consisting of a solvent - induced short - range attraction and long - range repulsion that is either of electrostatic origin , or is caused by polymeric brushes bound to the surface of the particles .",
    "the attraction favours formation of small clusters .",
    "because of the repulsion at large distances , however , large clusters are energetically unfavourable . for increasing concentration of the particles elongated clusters and a network",
    "were observed in both experiment and theory  @xcite .",
    "competing interactions of a quite different nature are present in systems containing amphiphilic molecules such as surfactants , lipids or diblock copolymers  @xcite .",
    "amphiphilic molecules are composed of covalently bound polar and organic parts , and in polar solvents self - assemble into spherical or elongated micelles , or form a network in the sponge phase .",
    "in addition , various lyotropic liquid crystal phases can be stable  @xcite .    despite of very different origin and shape of the interaction potentials ,",
    "very similar patterns occur on the mesoscopic length scale in the systems interacting with the isotropic salr potential , and in the amphiphilic solutions with strongly anisotropic interactions  @xcite . the particles interacting with the salr potential self - assemble into spherical or elongated clusters or form a network , whereas the amphiphiles self - assemble into spherical or elongated micells or form the sponge phase .",
    "the distribution of the clusters or the micelles in space and the transitions between ordered phases composed of these objects are very similar .",
    "the origin of the universal topology of the phase diagrams in the amphiphilic and salr systems was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown by a systematic coarse - graining procedure that in the case of weak order the colloidal and the amphiphilic self - assembly can be described by the same landau - brazovskii functional @xcite .",
    "the landau - brazovskii functional was first applied to the block - copolymers by leibler in 1980  @xcite .",
    "later functionals of the same type were applied to microemulsions @xcite .",
    "the landau - brazovskii -type functional , however , is appropriate only for weak order , where the average density and concentration are smooth , slowly varying functions on the mesoscopic length scale .",
    "moreover , in derivation of the functional various assumptions and approximations were made .",
    "further approximations are necessary in order to obtain solutions for the phase diagram , equation of state and correlation functions .",
    "thus , the question of universality of the pattern formation on the mesoscopic length scale , particularly at low temperatures , is only partially solved .",
    "we face two types of problems when we want to compare thermodynamic and structural properties in different self - assembling systems in the framework of statistical thermodynamics .",
    "first , one has to introduce generic models with irrelevant microscopic details disregarded .",
    "second , one has to make approximations to solve the generic models , or perform simulations .",
    "it is not obvious a priori how the assumptions made in construction of the model and the approximations necessary for obtaining the solutions influence the results . in the case of simulations the simulation box should be commensurate with the characteristic size of the inhomogeneities that is to be determined .",
    "it is thus important to introduce generic models for different types of self - assembly that can be solved exactly .",
    "exact solutions can be easily obtained in one - dimensional models , but there are no phase transitions in one dimension for temperatures @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the ground state ( gs ) can give important information about energetically favorable ordered structures , and pretransitional ordering for @xmath0 can be discussed based on exact results for the equation of state , correlation function and specific heat .",
    "a generic one - dimensional lattice model for the salr potential was introduced and solved exactly in ref.@xcite . in this model",
    "the nearest - neighbors ( nn ) attract each other , and the third neighbors repel each other .",
    "it is thus energetically favorable to form clusters composed of 3 particles separated by at least 3 empty sites .",
    "the gs is governed by the repulsion - to - attraction ratio @xmath1 and by the chemical potential of the particles .",
    "an interesting property of the gs is strong degeneracy at the coexistence of the ordered cluster phase with the gas or liquid phases . due to this degeneracy",
    "the entropy per site does not vanish .",
    "the collection of the microstates present for @xmath2 at the coexistence between the periodic and the gas or the liquid phases can be interpreted as a disordered cluster or bubble phase respectively . for @xmath0 pseudo phase transitions between the gas and the periodically distributed clusters , and between the periodically distributed clusters and the dense liquid phases were obtained .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) has a characteristic shape that is significantly different from the eos in simple fluids .",
    "a one dimensional lattice model for amphiphiles in solvents attracting one of the two parts of the amphiphilic molecule was introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the two models , one for the salr and the other one for the amphiphilic system , are defined on the same level of coarse - graining , therefore by comparing the exact results we can draw conclusions on similarities of self - assembly in these systems , and the origin of these similarities . in the model introduced in ref.@xcite",
    "the gs is strongly degenerate at the phase coexistence between the pure solvent and periodically distributed bilayers , and the entropy per site does not vanish .",
    "thus , the gs of the two models show remarkable similarity , despite quite different interaction potentials .",
    "this suggests similar origin of the formation of disordered phases with mesoscopic inhomogeneities in various systems with competing interactions .    in this work we solve exactly the model introduced in ref.@xcite by the transfer matrix method .",
    "we describe the model and its ground state in sec.2 . the transfer matrix and exact expressions for the grand potential , density and correlation function",
    "are given in sec.3 .",
    "in sec.4 and 5 we present our results for the eos and the correlation function . in sec.6",
    "we calculate the specific heat with fixed chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble , and by using thermodynamic relations we obtain the specific heat with fixed concentration . to check our exact calculations we also perform monte carlo simulations and compute the specific heat with fixed concentration directly in the canonical ensemble .",
    "our additional purpose is to verify the results of the simulations performed in a finite system by comparison with the exact results obtained in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we cross - check the exact and the simulation results for the specific heat , because in simulations of the 2- or 3-dimensional self - assembling systems the peak in the specific heat is interpreted as a signature of a phase transition@xcite .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to compare the simulation and the exact results for this important quantity . in sec.7 our results for the mechanical , structural and thermal properties",
    "are compared with the corresponding results obtained in ref.@xcite for the salr model .",
    "the amphiphilic molecules consist of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail , therefore the interactions between them depend on orientations . in the case of a two - component mixture of a polar solvent and amphiphilic molecules , for example lipids ,",
    "we assume that the solvent molecules attract the polar head , and effectively repel the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphilic molecule .",
    "we neglect orientational degrees of freedom of the solvent molecules . in a one - dimensional model",
    "the continuum of different orientations of amphiphiles is reduced to just two orientations ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we assume that the molecules occupy lattice sites , and the lattice constant @xmath3 is of order of the length of the amphiphilic molecule in this model . if the solvent molecules are much smaller than the amphiphilic molecules , we assume that the site is occupied by a cluster of several solvent molecules .    we assume nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the absolute value of the energy of two clusters of solvent molecules that occupy the nearest - neighbour sites , @xmath4 , is taken as the energy unit .",
    "we assume that the interaction between the cluster of solvent molecules and the amphiphilic molecule in the favorable ( unfavorable ) orientation is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and the interaction between two amphiphilic molecules in the favorable and unfavorable orientation is@xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the orientations of two amphiphilic molecules are favorable when they are oriented either head - to - head or tail - to - tail .",
    "the neighborhood of the polar head and the hydrophobic tail is unfavorable .",
    "the energies of different pairs of occupied sites are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_energies ] .",
    "the model is similar to a lattice model of ternary oil - water - surfactant mixtures introduced in ref.@xcite and to a continuous model of binary mixtures with amphiphiles  @xcite .",
    "different values of the parameters @xmath9 may correspond to different particular mixtures . in this work",
    "we are interested in general aspects of the amphiphilic self - assembly , especially in similarities between ordering on the mesoscopic length scale in the amphiphilic and colloidal systems , and in origin of these similarities .",
    "for this reason we shall not try to fit the model parameters to any particular mixture .",
    "a representative example of a system described by this model is a mixture of lipids and water .",
    "we should stress that water is a complex liquid  @xcite , and micro - heterogeneities are present in aqueous solutions of polar molecules @xcite .",

    "[ cv21 ] it follows that the dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath163 for fixed @xmath91 is nontrivial , and differs qualitatively from @xmath164 in the lattice gas or ising model . in the latter models",

    "in such a case phase - separated solvent and amphiphiles , or random positions and orientations are present for low @xmath95 or for high @xmath95 respectively , whereas between the two maxima of @xmath164 domains of solvent and properly oriented amphiphiles are formed .     as a function of @xmath91 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 and different temperatures . left : per unit volume ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "we have solved exactly the simple lattice model for amphiphilic mixtures introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ground - state shows that the model predicts the key properties of aqueous solutions of amphiphilic molecules such as lipids .",
    "it also helps to understand the relation between the degeneracy of the ground state and the low surface tension .",
    "for @xmath167 we have obtained oscillatory decay of correlations for the range of @xmath41 corresponding to the gs stability of the periodic phase .",
    "the oscillatory decay of correlations indicates alternating layers of the solvent and the properly oriented amphiphilic molecules . for small @xmath95 and for the range of the chemical potential @xmath41 corresponding to the gs stability of the periodic phase",
    "the correlation length is very large , a few orders of magnitude larger than the molecular size .",
    "thus , the correlation function is consistent with a quasi long - range order .",
    "the periodic ordering at low temperatures is reflected in the shape of the @xmath99 line too .",
    "the average density @xmath107 is nearly independent of pressure for a large pressure interval .",
    "these two results are consistent with a formation of solvent - separated bilayers in domains of a size of order of micrometers . for increasing @xmath95 the correlation length decreases , and",
    "the line @xmath99 becomes smoother .",
    "finally , the specific heat assumes a maximum for the concentration of amphiphiles @xmath102 corresponding to the gs stability of the periodic phase .",
    "the maximum becomes very narrow for low @xmath95 .",
    "when the periodic phase is not present on the gs ( see fig.2 ) , the maximum of the specific heat per amphiphilic molecule for @xmath102 is absent .",
    "we have found strong similarity of the @xmath2 phase diagrams for the present model for amphiphilic self - assembly ( fig.2 ) and for the lattice model for colloidal self - assembly ( fig.1 in ref .",
    "the phases with oscillatory density in the salr systems or oscillatory concentration in the amphiphilic mixtures occur when the repulsion in the case of the colloids or attraction between the solvent and properly oriented amphiphilic molecules are sufficiently strong .",
    "when the above interactions are weak , only two phases are present in the ground state , namely the gas and liquid in the salr case , and the pure water and amphiphile phases in the present model .",
    "it is interesting that the ground state has the same kind of degeneracy at the phase coexistence between the periodic phase and the pure solvent for both , the amphiphilic and the colloidal self - assembly  @xcite . in both models",
    "the ground state is strongly degenerate , and the surface tension between the homogeneous and the periodic phase vanishes for @xmath2 , although in the case of the colloidal self - assembly the particles have neither shape nor interaction anisotropy .",
    "arbitrary number of arbitrarily small droplets of the coexisting phases can be present at the phase coexistence .",
    "this degeneracy of the ground state means that the macroscopic separation of the two phases at @xmath168 is not possible , since the formation of an interface does not lead to any increase of the grand potential . at the same time , because of the microscopic size of the droplets , one can interpret the degenerate ground state as a disordered phase .",
    "the region of the @xmath2 phase diagram corresponding to the stability of this phase is of zero measure , however , in contrast to the remaining , ordinary phases .",
    "note that the ultra - low surface tension is a generic property of systems with competing tendencies in the interactions that lead to stability of periodic structures , and is not limited to amphiphilic molecules .",
    "the exact results for the present model and for the model of colloidal self - assembly show that the low surface tension is a more general property of systems with competing interactions , and is not limited to amphiphilic molecules .",
    "this confirms the observation of universality of the periodic ordering on the mesoscopic length scale that was derived under the assumption of weak ordering @xcite .",
    "the effect of the inhomogeneous density or concentration in the above systems on the equation of state has been studied in the framework of the statistical thermodynamics only very recently  @xcite .",
    "we have found strong similarity between the pressure - density isotherm in the salr system  @xcite and the pressure - concentration isotherm in our model of the amphiphilic mixture .",
    "the characteristic feature of these lines is the plateau in the density or concentration as a function of pressure .",
    "similar shapes have also the density - chemical potential and the concentration - chemical potential lines .",
    "the plateau occurs when the density or concentration takes the value corresponding to the periodic distribution of the clusters or the bilayers . for the corresponding range of @xmath41 and @xmath95 the correlation functions in both models exhibit exponentially damped oscillatory decay with a very large correlation length .",
    "the thermal properties are also similar . in both models",
    "the specific heat assumes a maximum for the density or concentration corresponding to the gs periodic phase .",
    "in addition , the specific heat per particle in the salr case or per amphiphilic molecule in this model increase for decreasing number of particles or amphiphilic molecules . this behavior is associated with the equilibrium between the clusters and isolated particles or between the bilayers ( or micelles ) and isolated amphiphiles .",
    "the main difference between the self - assembly in the amphiphilic and colloidal systems concerns the periodic ordering of the pure amphiphiles into the lamellar structure that is absent in the dense phase in the colloidal system .",
