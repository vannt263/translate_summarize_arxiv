    "in recent years , experimental studies of transport properties of high - mobility two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in weak perpendicular magnetic fields have uncovered a variety of remarkable quantum phenomena caused by transitions of electrons between different landau levels .",
    "such transitions can lead to oscillations of dissipative resistance as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , under steady - state microwave illumination of the 2d gas the resistance oscillates with a period determined by the ratio of the radiation frequency to the cyclotron frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro).@xmath1 for a sufficiently high radiation power the miro minima evolve into the intervals of magnetic field where the dissipative resistance vanishes.@xmath2 next , it was found that an increase in the electric current passing though the 2d layer substantially reduces the resistance@xmath3 and leads to oscillations of the resistance as a function of either the magnetic field or the current.@xmath4 such oscillations are controlled by the ratio of a characteristic energy , which is defined as the drop of the hall electric field across the classical cyclotron diameter , to the cyclotron energy .",
    "this phenomenon has been called the hall field - induced resistance oscillations ( hiro ) .",
    "it is also described in terms of zener tunneling between landau levels .",
    "finally , in the systems with two occupied 2d subbands the resistivity oscillates as a function of the ratio of subband separation energy to the cyclotron energy owing to coupling of the subbands via intersubband scattering .",
    "this phenomenon , called the magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso ) , is important in the systems with small subband separation , such as the double quantum wells.@xmath5 all these kinds of oscillations are insensitive to positions of the landau levels with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , unlike the shubnikov - de haas oscillations , they are not damped exponentially with increasing temperature .",
    "the oscillatory phenomena described above require the presence of microwave illumination , strong hall field , or intersubband coupling to enable resonant transitions between different landau levels via elastic scattering of electrons by impurities or other static imperfections of the system .",
    "the elastic scattering provides the main contribution to resistivity at low temperatures . in high - mobility samples",
    ", however , inelastic scattering of electrons by acoustic phonons also contributes to transport , and can exceed the impurity - scattering contribution at the temperatures of several k. therefore , acoustic - phonon - assisted transitions of electrons between landau levels become important .",
    "interestingly enough , these transitions in 2d case possess a resonant property and , for this reason , also lead to oscillations of the resistance .",
    "oscillations of this origin have been discovered recently.@xmath6 an analysis of experimental data has suggested that the resistivity acquires an oscillating contribution whose periodicity is determined by the resonant condition @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi momentum of electrons , @xmath9 is the constant of the order of sound velocity , and @xmath10 is an integer.@xmath6 this phenomenon has been called the phonon - induced resistance oscillations ( piro ) .",
    "similar oscillations have been observed later in the phonon drag thermal power measurements.@xmath11    since the quantity in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is a characteristic phonon energy , the piro can be viewed as magnetophonon oscillations . for the case of electron scattering by optical phonons ,",
    "the magnetophonon oscillations are known for a long time@xmath12 and have been observed both in bulk and 2d@xmath13 systems .",
    "the special feature of piro , in contrast to the oscillations owing to scattering by optical phonons , is the dependence of magnetophonon resonance on the electron momentum . by emitting or absorbing acoustic phonons , the electrons jump between the landau levels , and the maximum probability of such transitions",
    "is realized under electron backscattering condition , when the phonon wave number @xmath14 reaches its maximum value @xmath15 in the 2d plane .",
    "initially,@xmath6 this resonant property of the electron - phonon scattering was explained by involving the interface phonon model .",
    "later , by analyzing phonon - assisted transitions between landau levels , it was found@xmath11 that the bulk phonon model gives similar results .",
    "it is worth noting that the maximum probability of the backscattering processes ( @xmath16 ) is not related to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "it reflects a fundamental property of the kinematics of two - dimensional electron scattering by three - dimensional acoustic modes with frequency @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the in - plane and out - of - plane components of the phonon wave vector .",
    "it can be shown that the scattering probability , as a function of the phonon frequency , has a logarithmic singularity at the point of transition from the region @xmath20 , when pure 2d scattering ( @xmath21 ) is possible , to the region @xmath22 , when emission of three - dimensional phonons ( with finite @xmath19 ) becomes necessary .",
    "the systematic studies of the piro are now under way.@xmath23 however , current understanding of this phenomenon is far from complete .",
    "the characteristic phonon velocity @xmath9 entering eq .",
    "( 1 ) varies in different experiments@xmath24 in the range from 2.9 to 5.9 km / s , and the origin of such variations is not clear .",
    "the problem of the phase of the oscillations has not been discussed .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude of the oscillations on temperature and magnetic field has not been investigated in detail , though general features of the experimental dependence have been successfully related@xmath25 to the behavior of the density of electron states in magnetic field . the main difficulty for interpretation of the experimental magnetoresistance is the complicated nature of acoustic - phonon modes . even in the case when the influence of interfaces on the phonon spectrum is neglected ( bulk phonon approximation ) , one should take into account three different phonon branches characterized by anisotropic ( i.e. , dependent on the direction of phonon momentum ) velocities .    in this paper ,",
    "the theory of piro is developed within the bulk phonon approximation .",
    "both deformation - potential and piezoelectric mechanisms of electron - phonon interaction are included into consideration .",
    "the anisotropy of phonon spectrum is taken into account .",
    "the calculations are carried out for gaas quantum well layers grown in the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction .",
    "apart from the numerical results , approximate analytical expressions for the oscillating part of the phonon - induced resistivity are presented .",
    "the results are compared with available experimental data for two kinds of gaas layers with distinctly different densities and mobilities of 2d electrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains general description of the resistivity of 2d electrons interacting with acoustic phonons in a weak magnetic field .",
    "section iii includes both analytical and numerical results for the resistivity , their comparison with experiment , and discussion .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "experimental investigations of phonon - induced resistance oscillations are carried out at low temperatutes @xmath26 satisfying the condition of degenerate electron gas , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fermi energy .",
    "magnetic fields are weak enough to have many landau levels populated , @xmath29 , so the electron transport possesses some quasiclassical features ( for example , the electron momentum is still a good quantum number ) . in the same time , the high quality of the samples ensures that the landau quantization is not suppressed by scattering at such low magnetic fields .",
    "this means that the ratio of the cyclotron frequency @xmath30 to inverse quantum lifetime @xmath31 is not too small .",
    "next , since in the high - mobility samples the ratio of transport time to quantum lifetime is large , the oscillations are observed in the regime of classically strong magnetic fields , when the cyclotron frequency is much larger than the inverse transport time @xmath32 .",
    "the in - plane transport in this case can be viewed as hopping between cyclotron orbit centers , and the dissipative conductivity @xmath33 is represented in the form @xmath34 \\nu_{\\delta \\delta^{\\prime } } ( x_{\\delta } - x_{\\delta^{\\prime}})^2/2 , % 2\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the index of a quantum state of electron , @xmath36 is the coordinate of the cyclotron orbit center in the direction of motion , @xmath37 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath38 is the normalization area , and @xmath39 is the total scattering rate , which is represented as a sum of impurity and phonon scattering contributions : @xmath40 . assuming interaction of electrons with equilibrium phonons , the latter contribution is written as @xmath41 , % 3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the phonon mode index , wave vector , and frequency , respectively .",

    "the polarization vectors and the corresponding phonon mode frequencies are found from the eigenstate problem @xmath54 { \\rm e}_{\\lambda { \\bf q } j}=0 .",

    "equation ( 5 ) has three solutions describing a high - energy mode ( la ) , which becomes purely longitudinal for high - symmetry directions ( [ 100],[110 ] , and [ 111 ] ) , and two low - energy modes ( ta ) which become purely transverse for these directions . very often , theoretical studies of transport properties of electrons in solids with cubic lattice symmetry are based on the continuum approximation for elastic vibrations , when @xmath56 and the phonon spectrum is given by three isotropic branches including one longitudinal mode and two degenerate transverse modes .",
    "whereas this approach gives a reasonably good description of phonon - limited mobilities and applies for calculation of many kinetic coefficients , is not sufficient for description of phonon - induced resistance oscillations in magnetic field , because the anisotropy of the acoustic phonon branches is not weak in most semiconductors and becomes essential in evaluation of resonant scattering between landau levels .",

    "indeed , under the integral we have a rapidly oscillating function ( the argument of the cosine in eq .",

    "the slow modes ( which become purely transverse for high - symmetry directions ) also have extrema at @xmath127 .",
    "since the anisotropy of these modes is stronger , they also may have additional groups of extrema at @xmath128 , where @xmath129 .",
    "nevertheless , the main contribution of slow ( low - energy ) modes to oscillating magnetoresistance is associated with the extremum @xmath127 for a single mode whose velocity at @xmath127 is independent of the polar angle @xmath60 .",
    "this mode at @xmath127 is purely transverse and polarized perpendicular to the quantum well plane ( direction [ 001 ] ) .    in summary",
    ", the analysis shows that the modes effectively contributing to the oscillating part of resistivity are : i ) the transverse mode polarized along [ 001 ] , whose velocity @xmath130 is independent of @xmath60 and corresponds to a maximum of @xmath125 as a function of @xmath113 ; ii ) the longitudinal mode with velocity @xmath131 polarized along [ 100 ] or along equivalent directions ( [ 010 ] , [ @xmath13200 ] , and [ 0@xmath1320 ] ) corresponding to local minima of @xmath125 ; iii ) the longitudinal mode with velocity @xmath133 polarized along [ 110 ] or along equivalent directions ( [ 1@xmath1320 ] , [ @xmath13210 ] , and [ @xmath1340 ] ) corresponding to saddle points of @xmath125 .",
    "accordingly , the oscillatory harmonics of the scattering rate are written as sums of three components : @xmath135 where @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 the coefficients of order unity standing in the denominators of these expressions are given by @xmath139 @xmath140 and @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the positive quantity characterizing the anisotropy of phonon spectrum . the contribution from transverse phonons",

    "( 17)-(20 ) is not expected to be high for lowest - order piro peaks .",
    "nevertheless , the applicability of these equations is steadily improved as one moves to lower magnetic fields and the argument of the oscillating function becomes larger .",
    "for such low fields , the rate @xmath143 tends to overcome the rates @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "however , in the samples with higher electron density , where the characteristic phonon wave number @xmath15 is larger , the deformation - potential mechanism is more significant than the piezoelectric one",
    ". therefore , both transverse - phonon and longitudinal - phonon contributions are important and should be taken into account .",
    "notice also that for low magnetic fields corresponding to the case of overlapping landau levels one can take only the lowest harmonic @xmath146 in the sum in eq .",

    "17 and references therein ) . in the present formalism , this effect is described by adding the electron - electron scattering rate @xmath193 , where @xmath194 , to the inverse quantum lifetime@xmath195 @xmath31 entering the density of states in eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "the result of the calculations improved in this way is also shown in fig .",
    "4 . a reasonably good agreement with experimental data , as concerns the amplitudes of the oscillations and their temperature dependence , is achieved at @xmath196 .",
    "k , the partial oscillating contributions from high - energy branch ( la ) and low - energy branches ( ta ) are also shown ( shifted for clarity ) .",
    "the additional ( orange ) plots take into account temperature - induced decrease of the quantum lifetime and are in a better agreement with experimental data of ref .",

    "2 gives the characteristic velocity @xmath197 km / s , which is smaller than @xmath198 km / s determined in ref .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the positions of the peaks in the experiment ref .",
    "14 are shifted to higher magnetic fields as the temperature increases .",
    "though the reason of this shift is not clear , it signifies an increase of experimental velocity @xmath9 with temperature .",
    "therefore , one may expect a better agreement of theory and experiment at lower temperatures .",
    "this paper presents a microscopic theory of magnetophonon oscillations , also known as phonon - induced resistance oscillations ( piro ) , in 2d electron systems .",
    "the phonon - induced resistivity @xmath80 is found by considering both deformation - potential and piezoelectric mechanisms of interaction of 2d electrons with bulk acoustic phonon modes . in the experimentally relevant situation of weak magnetic fields ( large filling factors ) , the expression for the resistivity ( or , eqivalently , for the phonon - assisted transport rate @xmath79 )",
    "is determined by the electron - phonon coupling constants , phonon frequencies , and the density of electron states in magnetic field ; see eq .",
    ". the essential feature of the calculations is that the anisotropy of the phonon spectrum is explicitly taken into account .",
    "the theory is applied to quantum wells based on the materials of cubic symmetry and grown in the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction . for this case ,",
    "an analytical expression for the oscillating part of the resistivity has been derived .",
    "this expression is valid in the region of fields corresponding to high - order magnetophonon resonances , when the ratio of characteristic phonon frequency to cyclotron frequency is large .",
    "the calculations are carried out for gaas quantum wells where piro have been observed experimentally .",
    "this includes the cases of 2d electron gas with high density and moderate mobility@xmath191 and with lower density and very high mobility.@xmath25 the calculated magnetoresistance is in agreement with experimental data . as concerns the positions of the magnetoresistance peaks ,",
    "the agreement is very good in the case of high - mobility systems.@xmath25    based on the results obtained , one may conclude that the bulk approximation for description of acoustic phonon modes and of their interaction with 2d electrons works reasonably good in application to magnetotransport in gaas quantum wells .",
    "another important conclusion is that the velocity @xmath9 in the empirical equation ( 1 ) does not , in general , correspond to a certain phonon mode .",
    "the reason for this is the complicated structure of the phonon spectrum .",
    "there are three anisotropic phonon modes ( branches ) with different velocities and two mechanisms , deformation - potential and piezoelectric , of electron - phonon interaction .",
    "relative contributions of these modes and of the interaction mechanisms depend on 2d electron density , temperature , and other parameters such as the width of the quantum well and growth direction .",
    "this explains why the velocity @xmath9 determined by fitting the experimental piro peak positions is expected to vary in different experiments , especially when such a fit is based upon a few low - order peaks which have the highest amplitudes and , therefore , are best visible experimentally .",
    "indeed , the low - order peaks are typically formed as a superposition of contributions from different modes , and even for each single mode there is a mixture of phonons with different velocities owing to the anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy influences not only the frequency but also the phase and the amplitude of the oscillations .    on the other hand , in the region of high - order magnetophonon resonances",
    "the resistance oscillations are described by a fixed set of phonon velocities determined here for the case of [ 001]-grown quantum wells ; see eqs .",
    "( 17)-(20 ) .",
    "the phases of these oscillations also become definite . moreover ,",
    "if the density of 2d electrons is not large , so the piezoelectric - potential interaction is significant , the main contribution to magnetoresistance oscillations in [ 001]-grown wells is characterized by a single velocity @xmath199 corresponding to a ta mode propagating in the quantum well plane and polarized perpendicular to this plane .",
    "this is the case of experiment ref .",
    "17 , where many magnetoresistance oscillations have been observed owing to a very high electron mobility . for the wells whose growth axes are different from [ 001 ] the characteristic phonon velocities have to be different .",
    "these cases are not studied here in detail because piro have not yet been observed in such wells .",
    "nevertheless , based on the consideration presented in sec .",
    "iii , the following general method for determination of characteristic phonon velocities in the wells of arbitrary growth axis is proposed .",
    "take the surfaces of equal frequency @xmath200 defined for each mode in the @xmath201-space by the equation @xmath202 .",
    "find the points ( numbered by the index @xmath203 ) where these surfaces touch the surface of the cylinder of radius @xmath15 and axis along the growth direction ( this cylindrical surface is given by the equation @xmath204 ) .",
    "the set of frequencies @xmath205 ( or , equivalently , velocities @xmath206 ) corresponding to these points will give a set of oscillating harmonics with arguments @xmath207 in the magnetoresistance .",
    "an equivalent procedure is the search for extrema of the function @xmath208 , as described in sec .",
    "iii . to find which frequencies out of @xmath209 give the main contribution and to determine the phases and amplitudes of the oscillations , a detailed analysis is necessary . in the case of [ 001]-grown wells",
    "a single ta mode gives the main contribution [ eq .",
    "( 18 ) ] because the surface of equal frequency for this particular mode touches the cylinder not just in a finite number of points , but along the whole circumference of the cylinder at @xmath127 . to study the influence of different phonon modes on the magnetoresistance oscillations , it is desirable to carry out experiments in high - mobility 2d systems with densities varied in the range @xmath210 @xmath162",
    ". if it is possible to reach high mobilities for the structures with growth axes different from [ 001 ] , measurements of the oscillating magnetoresistance in such systems would be also important for investigation of the phonon anisotropy effects discussed above .",
    "the author hopes that the present theoretical work may stimulate such experiments .",
    "the consideration given in this paper assumes the linear response regime , when both electron and phonon systems are close to equilibrium .",
    "one may expect a more interesting and rich behavior of the phonon - induced resistance oscillations under nonlinear transport regime when the electric current through the sample increases .",
    "studies in this direction are already undertaken.@xmath211 in addition to the work already done , more efforts , both experimental and theoretical , are necessary for better understanding of the mechanisms of phonon - induced oscillations and their interplay with the other microscopic mechanisms responsible for the magnetoresistance of 2d electrons at large filling factors .",
