    "the main goal of string phenomenology is to make contact between string theory and the real world . in particular , this involves searching for a specific string vacuum which reproduces the standard model ( sm ) in complete detail .",
    "this is not an easy task .",
    "the sm has an intricate structure , with three - generations of chiral fermions which transform as bifundamental representations of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the fact that the sm fermions are replicated into three distinct families , the families exhibit a pattern of mass hierarchies and mixings .",
    "although there have been many models which can reproduce the gross features of the sm , there are generally problems either with extra exotic particles or an inability to generate fermion mass hierarchies and mixings .",
    "interestingly , the so - called intersecting @xmath06-brane models where the chiral fermions arise at the intersections between @xmath06 branes ( type iia ) in the internal space  @xcite together with the t - dual type iib description in terms of magnetized d - branes  @xcite have provided an exciting approach toward constructing semi - realistic string vacua ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", intersecting d - brane models may naturally generate the sm fermion mass hierarchies and mixings , as well as an explanation for the replication of chirality .",
    "indeed , such models provide promising setups which may accommodate semi - realistic features of low - energy physics . in short ,",
    "@xmath06-branes ( in type iia string theory ) fill four - dimensional minkowski space - time and wrap 3-cycles in the compact manifold , with a stack of @xmath4 @xmath06-branes having a gauge group @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 in the case of @xmath7 ) in its world volume .",
    "the 3-cycles wrapped by the d - branes will in general intersect multiple times in the internal space , resulting in chiral fermions in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersections between different stacks .",
    "the multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect .",
    "the yukawa couplings in intersecting @xmath06-brane models arise from open string world - sheet instantons that connect three @xmath06-brane intersections @xcite . for a given triplet of intersections , the minimal world - sheet action which contributes to the trilinear yukawa couplings",
    "is weighted by a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the world - sheet area of the triangle bounded by the branes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since there are several possible triangles with different areas , mass hierarchies may inherently arise .",
    "the yukawa couplings depend on both the d - brane positions in the internal space as well as on the geometry of the underlying compact manifold .",
    "effectively , these quantities are parameterized by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of open and closed - string moduli .    in most intersecting d - brane models",
    ", there has typically been a rank one problem in the sm fermion yukawa matrices , preventing the generation of masses and mixings for the first two families of quarks and leptons . for the case of toroidal orientifold compactifications ,",
    "this can be traced to the fact that not all of the sm fermions are localized at intersections on the same torus  @xcite . however , there is one example known of an intersecting @xmath06-brane model in type iia on the @xmath1 orientifold where these problems may be solved  @xcite .",
    "thus , this particular model may be a step forward to obtaining realistic phenomenology from string theory . indeed , as we have recently shown  @xcite , it is possible within the moduli space of this model to obtain the correct sm quark masses and mixings , the tau lepton mass , and to generate naturally small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism . in addition to these features ,",
    "the model exhibits automatic gauge coupling unification , and it is possible to generate realistic low - energy supersymmetric particle spectra , a subset of which may produce the observed dark matter density  @xcite .",
    "although this model exhibits a realistic chiral sector , it can not be considered fully realistic until the moduli stabilization problem has been completely addressed .",
    "for example , although it has been shown that it is possible to obtain correct yukawa mass matrices , it is not possible to say that this is a unique solution until both open and closed string moduli vevs can be fixed dynamically .",
    "similar considerations apply to the case of supersymmetry breaking , although the low - energy effective action may be determined as functions of the moduli .",
    "however , in light of the soon to be operational large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is still an interesting exercise to study the possible phenomenology of this model which could potentially be observed at lhc , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the intersecting d - brane model under study .",
    "we consider type iia string theory compactified on a @xmath1 orientifold  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 is a six - torus factorized as @xmath13 whose complex coordinates are @xmath14 , @xmath15 for the @xmath16 two torus , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 generators for the orbifold group @xmath19 , act on the complex coordinates of @xmath20 as @xmath21 the orientifold projection is applied by gauging the symmetry @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is world - sheet parity , and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 thus , there are four kinds of orientifold 6-planes ( o6-planes ) for the actions @xmath22 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "there are two kinds of complex structures consistent with orientifold projection for a two torus : rectangular and tilted  @xcite .",
    "if we denote the homology classes of the three cycles wrapped by the @xmath06-brane stacks as @xmath29+m_p^i[b_i]$ ] and @xmath30+m_p^i[b_i]$ ] with @xmath31=[a_i]+\\frac{1}{2}[b_i]$ ] for the rectangular and tilted tori respectively , we can label a generic one cycle by @xmath32 in either case , where in terms of the wrapping numbers @xmath33 for a rectangular two torus and @xmath34 for a tilted two torus .",
    "moreover , for a stack of @xmath4 @xmath06-branes that does not lie on one of the o6-planes , we obtain a @xmath6 gauge symmetry with three adjoint chiral superfields due to the orbifold projections , while for a stack of @xmath4 @xmath06-branes which lies on an o6-plane , we obtain a @xmath35 gauge symmetry with three anti - symmetric chiral superfields .",
    "bifundamental chiral superfields arise from the intersections of two different stacks @xmath36 and @xmath37 of @xmath06-branes or from one stack @xmath36 and its @xmath22 image @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "we present the @xmath06-brane configurations and intersection numbers of the model in table  [ mi - numbers ] , and the resulting spectrum in table  [ spectrum ]  @xcite .",
    "we put the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath11 stacks of @xmath06-branes on top of each other on the third two torus , and as a result there are additional vector - like particles from @xmath41 subsectors .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we now have the complete set of final states for the model in hand , so we can compare them to the expected final states for msugra . in the region of the msugra",

    "the characteristic decay chain in this region of msugra is @xmath42 . in the msugra region of the allowed parameter space that can generate the relic density in the ssc scenario ,",
    "the three characteristic decays are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  @xcite . in the region of the @xmath06-brane model parameter space with patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 that can generate the wmap observed relic density , we see similar states to that of msugra , namely low energy ( @xmath4820 gev ) opposite sign tau pairs . on the other hand , the states do begin to differ between the @xmath06-brane model and msugra in the ssc scenario .",
    "we showed that the final states in the ssc region for patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be high energy ( @xmath4920 gev ) opposite sign tau pairs .",
    "high energy tau will be dominant in the region of the msugra parameter space with a large universal gaugino mass @xmath50 , nevertheless , as @xmath50 is decreased , the dominant decay chains shift to the higgs boson and z boson .",
    "therefore , we see similar lhc signals in the ssc region of the @xmath06-brane allowed parameter space with patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the ssc region of the msugra allowed parameter space only at higher values of @xmath50 . for lower values of @xmath50 in msugra in the ssc region , there are obvious distinctions with the @xmath06-brane model .",
    "clearly identifiable differences exist between the lhc states of msugra and the @xmath06-brane model states in the regions of the allowed parameter space with pattern @xmath51 . the decay @xmath52 is favored in the @xmath06-brane model , but is kinematically forbidden in msugra , and moreover , the production of opposite sign tau pairs is suppressed in the wmap and ssc regions of the @xmath06-brane parameter space with pattern @xmath51 , as compared to msugra .",
    "we have found that in the region of the allowed parameter space that generates the wmap constrained dark matter density for patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the final states of an intersecting @xmath06-brane model are essentially the same as the final states for msugra . in msugra ,",
    "only specific regions of the parameter space are cosmologically allowed within the wmap dark matter density upper and lower bounds .",
    "one of these regions is referred to as the stau - neutralino coannihilation region , where early universe neutralinos can annihilate with stau , producing low - energy tau .",
    "it is characterized by a nearly degenerate mass between the lightest neutralino @xmath53 and the tau slepton @xmath54 , this near degeneracy measured by the mass difference @xmath55 m = @xmath56 .",
    "we found regions of the @xmath06-brane model parameter space with stau patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 possess stau - neutralino coannihilation regions , as shown in fig .  [ fig : d6_staucoannihilation ] .",

    "the ultimate goal is to determine the model parameters of the intersecting brane model , although this presents new challenges since the soft - terms are in general non - universal . in the present model",
    "we have seven soft - supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the unification scale which are functions of three goldstino angles which parameterize the f - terms , along with the free parameter tan@xmath61 .",
    "a minimum of four experimental observables are needed to determine the model parameters , where the four observables could be constructed so as to determine four of the eight parameters , say , for example , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and tan@xmath61 .",
    "once @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are determined , then eqs .  ( [ eq : idb : gaugino ] ) ,  ( [ eq : idb : trilinear_u ] ) , and  ( [ eq : idb : scalarmass_u ] ) can be solved simultaneously for the three free parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . after solving these three equations ,",
    "these three free parameters can be used to compute the remaining four soft - supersymmetry breaking mass parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , and henceforth , along with a known tan@xmath61 , the sparticle masses and relic density can be computed .",
    "it has yet to be determined whether four experimental observables could be constructed to compute four of the eight @xmath06-brane model parameters . for msugra",
    ", it was shown in  @xcite that the model parameters can be determined for the wmap constrained region of the relic density , and in  @xcite in the context of ssc , where four experimental observables were derived , one for each of the four soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters in msugra .",
    "the final states in the regions of the parameter space with pattern @xmath51 are different than the final states in regions of the parameter space with patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 , demonstrated by the fact the @xmath06-brane model contains both stau - neutralino and chargino - neutralino coannihilation regions that generate the wmap observed dark matter density , as well as multiple independent regions that generate the diluted relic density of the ssc scenario .",
    "this greatly complicates the task since the construction of experimental observables to determine the model parameters in those regions of the parameter space with pattern @xmath51 will not necessarily determine the model parameters in those regions of the parameter space with patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , with the intersecting @xmath06-brane model parameter space as it is currently constrained by standard model measurements , it is likely more than four experimental observables will be necessary .",
    "the final states in the wmap and ssc regions of the parameter space are quite similar , though the energy of the lepton pairs will be higher in the ssc region than in the wmap region .",
    "this will necessitate different selection cuts on the data distributions , creating a new experimental observable .",
    "therefore , in this context , the maximum number of observables necessary to determine the model parameters in the @xmath06-brane model could well exceed four .",
    "it is essential that an intersecting @xmath06-brane model be distinguished from msugra , though this task is complicated by the possibility that the final states of both models are similar in the stau - neutralino coannihilation regions . for the @xmath06-brane model",
    ", the goal is to build four experimental observables to determine the seven soft - supersymmetry breaking terms and tan@xmath61 by solving for the free parameters and then computing the remaining soft terms .",
    "likewise , it has been shown  @xcite@xcite that only four observables are necessary to determine the model parameters in msugra , although the universal gaugino and scalar masses in msugra will be different from the non - universal masses in an intersecting brane model . however , since none of the experimentally allowed regions of the @xmath06-brane model parameter space that we generated using the equations given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : idb : gaugino ] ) ,  ( [ eq : idb : bino ] ) ,  ( [ eq : idb : trilinear_u ] ) ,  ( [ eq : idb : scalarmass_u ] ) , and  ( [ eq : idb : higgsmass_u ] ) for @xmath77-moduli dominated susy breaking have universal gaugino masses and universal scalar masses , msugra is not presumed to be a subset of the @xmath06-brane model , and hence , the observables in the @xmath06-brane model will most likely possess a different construction than the corresponding observables in msugra .",
    "construction of experimental observables that can determine model parameters is beyond the scope of this work . in order to do this",
    "it is first imperative that the parameter space be further constrained to eventually narrow down the number of different patterns of the mass spectra to only one .",
    "this could limit the number of experimental observables necessary to determine the model parameters to four .",
    "this can be accomplished by application of new data , both from colliders and from cosmological measurements , such as from direct dark - matter detection and constraints on the galactic gamma flux resulting from neutralino annihilations . for a discussion on direct dark matter detection cross - sections and annihilation rates in the present model ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we have explored the low - energy supersymmetry phenomenology of a near - realistic intersecting @xmath06-brane model in type iia string theory .",
    "the @xmath06 model has three generations of sm fermions and exhibits automatic gauge coupling unification .",
    "in addition , it is possible to obtain correct masses and mixings for both up and down - type quarks as well as the tau lepton . to date , this is the only known string model where this is possible .",
    "we calculated the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms and superpartner spectra satisfying all presently known experimental constraints for the @xmath77-moduli dominated susy breaking scenario and showed there are regions within the parameter space which may generate both the wmap observed dark matter density and the diluted relic density in the context of ssc .",
    "five regions in the allowed parameter space were identified that possess a different hierarchy of the four lightest sparticles in the mass spectrum .",
    "it was found that only three of these regions can generate the correct wmap and ssc relic densities .",
    "we constructed the final states for regions of the parameter space that can generate the wmap observed relic density , which consisted of low energy tau and jets in the stau - neutralino coannihilation region , and low energy leptons , high energy neutrinos , and jets in the chargino - neutralino coannihilation region . in the ssc scenario",
    ", we found the final states are high energy leptons , high energy neutrinos , and jets .",
    "we found that the minimum number of required observables to determine the free parameters is four , although this number of observables could exceed the minimum due to the dissimilar final states between the three regions of the allowed parameter space that can generate the correct relic density .",
    "finally , we discussed how further constraining the parameter space with new measurements can set the maximum number of observables .",
    "time will tell whether or not string theory will say anything definitive about what is observed at lhc .",
