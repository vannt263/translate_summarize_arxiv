    "over the past decade , observations have demonstrated that strong ly@xmath0 forest absorbers ( lyfas ) generally show associated metal line absorption ( meyer & york 1987 ; lu 1991 ; cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; womble et al . 1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 , hereafter sc ) .",
    "sc find civ absorption in nearly all lyfas at @xmath2 with neutral column densities @xmath10 and in @xmath11 of systems with @xmath12 .",
    "the observed civ column densities are consistent with the absorbers having a mean metallicity @xmath13 } \\sim -2.5 $ ] and an intrinsic scatter in metallicity of about an order of magnitude ( rauch et al .",
    "1996 ; hellsten et al .",
    "an important question is whether or not a chemically pristine or extremely metal poor population of lyfas exists , and if so , what the characteristic hi column densities of this population are . for @xmath14",
    "the associated civ lines are close to the detection limits of sc , and it can not yet be determined if these absorbers have the same metallicity distribution as those with higher @xmath1 .",
    "some theoretical models of early metal enrichment predict that the mean metallicity declines steadily with decreasing @xmath1 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "considerable progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of lyfas . from the work of several groups ( e.g. cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et al . 1995 ; petitjean et al .",
    "1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) a picture has emerged in which the lyfas are interpreted in terms of `` gunn - peterson '' absorption in an inhomogenous igm pervaded by a background ionizing radiation field , presumed to originate from qsos and perhaps young , star - forming galaxies .",
    "this picture links the ly@xmath0 forest directly to cosmological structure formation .",
    "the analysis of cosmological models of the lyfas consists of producing artificial spectra by evaluating the absorption properties of the baryonic igm along lines of sight through n - body and hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation .",
    "these spectra can then be analyzed in much the same way as observed qso spectra , and the resulting distribution functions in @xmath1 and linewidths are found to agree quantitatively with those observed , lending considerable support to the cosmological lyfa picture ( e.g. miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; dav et al . 1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the metal line data within the framework of these models provides a strong test of this picture .",
    "if a metal enrichment pattern of the baryonic igm is specified , the properties of selected absorption lines are readily calculated from the knowledge of densities , temperatures , and uv radiation field along the lines of sight ( haehnelt et al . 1996 ; rauch et al .",
    "1996 ; hellsten et al .",
    "1997 ) . until now",
    ", the metal lines considered have been limited to ovi(1032,1038 ) , nv(1239,1243 ) , civ(1548,1551 ) , siiv(1394,1403 ) , and cii(1335 ) .",
    "these lines have been chosen because they have already been identified with lyfas in real qso spectra . with the exception of the ovi doublet they all have rest wavelengths @xmath15  , which means that for lyfas at sufficiently high redshifts , they appear redward of the ly@xmath0 forest and hence are relatively easy to detect . instead of making an a priori selection of a few metal lines to include in a cosmological model for lyfas , a more satisfactory approach would be to make the models _ predict _ which metal lines , out of thousands of candidates , should be observable ( in spectra of a given resolution and s / n ) in lyfas of different column densities .",
    "such an approach would allow a comprehensive and swift selection of lines that deserve a more detailed treatment , depending on the specific purpose of the modeling .",
    "it would provide a sharper test of the model and place more stringent constraints on the metallicities and uv radiation spectrum , by making it possible to compare the complete list of metal lines predicted to be observable to the list of lines actually detected in qso spectra , as well as the observed relative strengths of these lines .",
    "this paper presents and applies a technique for implementing this comprehensive , a priori approach to metal line absorption predictions in cosmological models . in section 2",
    "we define a line observability index , which can easily be evaluated for a database of metal lines , within a particular model for lyfas .",
    "this index is a measure of column density and hence allows the lines to be sorted by strength .",
    "it also predicts which lines should be detectable in lyfas for a wide range of column densities and metallicities . in section 3 we apply this technique to two specific cosmological models of the ly@xmath0 forest , based on hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation . in section 4 we discuss the dependence of the lox on model parameters such as the mean baryon density and radiation field and estimate how it changes with redshift , and we argue that the lox has only a very weak dependence on the underlying cosmology .",
    "we discuss the results and summarize the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "detection limits for absorption lines can be conveniently expressed in terms of the equivalent width    @xmath16    where @xmath17 denotes the received energy flux per wavelength interval , normalized to the continuum level . for absorption lines that are weak enough to be optically thin , the rest frame equivalent width",
    "@xmath18 is proportional to the column density @xmath19 of absorbing atoms along the line of sight    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the oscillator strength and rest frame wavelength of the line considered .",
    "the other symbols have their usual meaning .",

    "the model - dependent ionization corrections are contained in the last term , which is a mean value of the ratio of the ionization fractions @xmath30 of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the region where the ly@xmath0 absorption arises .",
    "equation ( [ lox ] ) assumes units of @xmath33 for @xmath1 and  for @xmath25 ; the choice of additive constant then implies @xmath34 for weak lines .",
    "the lox can thus be used to rank metal lines in terms of strength , and it can be directly compared to the detection limit in spectra of a given quality .",
    "computation of the lox as a function of @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath1 requires a model of the densities and temperatures within ly@xmath0 forest absorbers , which together with the ionizing background radiation field @xmath36 determine the ionization term @xmath37 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we have applied the lox technique to two different cosmological simulations .",
    "one is the standard cdm simulation described in dav et al .",
    "a box of length 22.222 comoving mpc containing baryonic and dark matter is evolved from @xmath38 to @xmath39 using treesph ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) , assuming a cdm spectrum of density fluctuations with the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45km / s / mpc and @xmath46 is the slope of the initial perturbation spectrum .",
    "the other simulation , a flat , nonzero-@xmath47 model , also assumes a cdm spectrum of density fluctuations , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath43 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the standard model is inconsistent with the amplitude of cmb anisotropy measured by cobe ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) , but the normalization of the @xmath47 model ( computed using the cmbfast program of seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) is matched to the 4-year cobe data .",
    "for further details regarding the simulation method , see katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1996a ) .",
    "the analysis of the two cosmological models yielded very similar results .",
    "the lox is a local property , depending on the conditions within individual density peaks along the line of sight , which are insensitive to the underlying cosmology .",
    "hence , in the following we will only describe the calculations for one of the models , the @xmath47cdm model , and we will focus on results at @xmath53 . a spatially uniform photoionizing background radiation field is imposed , with the shape computed by haardt & madau ( 1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "they calculate the modification due to absorption and re - emission by the igm of an input radiation field with @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "this radiation field , at @xmath53 , has a larger drop above the @xmath60 absorption edge at 4 rd than the previously published haardt & madau spectrum ( 1996 ) , by roughly a factor of three , and it is therefore in better agreement with the relatively large number of siiv systems observed at that redshift ( see the discussion in hellsten et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to evaluate the ionization correction term in expression ( [ lox ] ) we need to know the typical volume densities and temperatures in the absorbers for different values of @xmath1 . to find the relation between these quantities , we generated artificial ly@xmath0 absorption spectra along 480 lines of sight through the simulation box at @xmath53 , using the method described in hellsten et al .",
    "the lines of sight were selected to include a relatively large number of the high - column density absorbers in order to get good statistics for these rather uncommon systems .",
    "we use artificial spectra along random lines of sight to fix the overall amplitude of the background radiation field , scaling @xmath36 by a constant factor so that the mean ly@xmath0 flux decrement in the simulated spectra matches the value @xmath61 found by press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 ; see further discussion by rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure [ figcolnh ] shows results from an analysis of 1456 hi absorption features detected in these artificial spectra .",
    "lines are identified by a threshold criterion in the following way .",
    "first , we define the velocity interval from a position where the hi optical depth @xmath62 increases above a critical value @xmath63 until it drops below that value again as belonging to an hi absorption feature .",
    "next , we augment this interval on both sides until either @xmath64 or a local maximum in @xmath62 is encountered .",
    "this procedure separates weakly blended `` w - shaped '' absorption features , if @xmath65 at the central local minimum .",
    "the hi column density of the absorber is found by integration of @xmath62 over the velocity interval , i.e.    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is measured in km / s in the rightmost expression .",
    "the crucial question for our purposes is the relation between @xmath1 and the typical volume density of gas in the absorbing region . because of peculiar motions and doppler broadening , the absorbing hi atoms in a given velocity bin originate at slightly different spatial locations .",
    "the code we developed to generate the artificial spectra also determines the _ mean _ total hydrogen volume density @xmath68 in the regions from which the hi atoms originate . in figure [ figcolnh ]",
    "we plot @xmath69 vs. @xmath1 , where @xmath69 is the maximum value of @xmath68 in the velocity interval @xmath70 of that absorption feature . in the spectra ,",
    "the location of this density peak is close to the location of the maximum of @xmath71 , as one would expect .    as can be seen in figure [ figcolnh ]",
    ", there is a well - defined correlation between the hi column density of a lyfa and the typical total volume hydrogen density of the absorbing region .",
    "the thick solid line is the power - law fit    @xmath72    which we will use to evaluate the lox .",
    "relation ( [ nnhfit ] ) depends on the value of @xmath73 , i.e. , the total mean baryonic density .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath73 will shift the curve upward if @xmath74 is held constant ( to satisfy the mean flux decrement constraint ) by adjusting the intensity of the uv radiation field .",
    "the indicated scaling with @xmath73 in ( [ nnhfit ] ) is only approximate , because it neglects effects of the temperature dependence on @xmath73 ( croft et .",
    "al . 1997 ) .",
    "we will assume @xmath75 throughout this paper , except for the discussion in section 4 .",
    "while a similar correlation between @xmath69 and @xmath1 holds at other redshifts , the constant of proportionality is different because of the evolution in the radiation field and the igm structure , in particular the dilution of the cosmic mean density by the expansion of the universe .",
    "the @xmath69-@xmath1 correlation for the scdm model is very similar , with a slope of about 0.73 instead of 0.7 , and the resulting line observability indices are nearly identical for the two relations .    also shown in figure [ figcolnh ] is the mean total hydrogen density at @xmath53 in this model .",
    "it is seen that the model predicts that lyfas with @xmath76 at @xmath53 arise from underdense regions ( similar to the result of zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the relation between density and temperature is slightly more complex .",
    "figure  [ figtnh ] shows a plot of @xmath69 versus mean temperature for the same density peaks as those shown in figure [ figcolnh ] . for low densities a large fraction of the peaks",
    "follow the relation @xmath77 . at densities",
    "@xmath78 , the density - temperature correlation arises mainly from the interplay between photoionization heating and adiabiatic cooling due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "low density regions have lower neutral fractions , hence lower photoionization heating rates , and they expand more rapidly , thus experiencing stronger adiabatic cooling .",
    "some of the peaks lie above this temperature - density relation , at @xmath79 , because of moderate shock heating .",
    "peaks with @xmath80 have large enough densities for radiative cooling to become significant , and the temperature is roughly determined by the equilibrium between radiative cooling and photoionization heating .",
    "( for a more detailed discussion of the density - temperature relation in cosmological simulations , see , e.g. , croft et al . 1997 ; hui & gnedin 1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) . for our lox calculations we will adopt the relation defined by the solid line in figure [ figtnh ] .",
    "this relation is again very similar to that in the scdm model , although the latter shows a slightly larger scatter at lower densities .",
    "because photoionization is the main source of ionization at such low densities , the lox is insensitive to the exact value of the temperature .    for an arbitrary metal line @xmath81 associated with a lyfa with neutral column density @xmath1 and metallicity [ z / h ] , we can now evaluate the ionization correction term in ( [ lox ] ) using the photoionization code cloudy 90 ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the inputs to cloudy are the hydrogen volume density and the temperatures from the relations discussed above , as well as the uv radiation field . for systems with @xmath82 , continuum heii absorption affects the radiation field in the central regions of the absorbers .",
    "we include this effect in an approximate way , by solving self - consistently for the radiative transfer through a plane parallel slab with hi column density @xmath83 , illuminated from both sides .",
    "we then use the volume averaged values of the ionization fractions , which should roughly be equal to those in the central region of an absorber with hi column density @xmath1 . including this heii - shielding effect only changes the predicted lox values slightly .",
    "the results in table 1 are produced by evaluating the lox for the 2249 transitions in the compilation by verner , barthel , and tytler ( 1994 ) and then sorting the lines according to the observability index .",
    "the strongest lines are shown for five different values of the hi column density , @xmath84 , 14 , 15 , 16 , and 17 .",
    "we show , for @xmath85 , only the ten strongest lines with @xmath86 .",
    "these extreme ultraviolet lines are numerous , but in spectra of the faint qsos at @xmath2 they are extremely difficult to detect , even with state of the art instruments such as the space telecope imaging spectrograph , installed on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in february 1997 ( e.g. danks et al . 1996 ) . at somewhat lower redshifts ,",
    "the prospects should be better for observing these lines in stis spectra of a few very bright qsos , such as he 2347 + 4342 ( @xmath87=2.88 , reimers et al .",
    "1997 ) , but the observations have yet to be made . with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) ,",
    "scheduled to be installed on the hst in 2002 ( green et al .",
    "1997 ) , detection of these important lines may finally become possible for a larger number of qsos at high redshift .    a metallicity of @xmath88}=-2.5 $ ] has been assumed in table 1 , and we use the solar metallicity values from grevesse & anders ( 1989 ) .",
    "we evaluate the lox for solar _ relative _ abundances , i.e. [ z / o]=0 .",
    "it can then be scaled to any other relative abundance pattern a posteriori .",
    "for example , if [ o / c]=0.5 , as observed in some low metallicity systems ( e.g. wheeler et al . 1989 ) , we have to add 0.5 to the lox values for o lines , ( i.e. use [ o / h]=-2 ) in order to compare them to the c lines for [ c / h]=-2.5 .    before discussing the results in table 1 ,",
    "let us estimate detection limits in present day , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) hires spectra .",
    "for a line with rest frame wavelength @xmath89 , the rest equivalent width threshold for an @xmath90-sigma detection is    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the number of pixels used for the equivalent width detection limit and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) is the velocity ( wavelength ) spread per pixel ( churchill 1997 ) .",
    "for the spectrum of q1422 + 231 obtained by sc , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . hence lines with @xmath97 should be detectable at the 5-sigma level in that spectrum .",
    "( recall from  2 that @xmath98 for weak lines . )",
    "the s / n per pixel is roughly 110 outside the ly@xmath0 forest and 45 within the forest , which translates into a minimum detectable lox of approximately 0.26 outside the forest and 0.65 within the forest .",
    "the integration time for this spectrum was 8.2 hrs .",
    "if the qso is observed for 3 - 4 nights the s / n ratio could be roughly doubled , so a practical absolute lower limit for observable lines would be lox @xmath99 .    looking at table 1 , the ovi(1032,1038 ) doublet is predicted to be a dominant metal line feature associated with lyfas with @xmath84 , 14 , and 15 . for [ o / h]=-2 , ovi(1032 ) becomes observable for @xmath100 and tops the list for more than two orders of magnitude in @xmath1 . because this ovi doublet has rest wavelengths less than 1216  ,",
    "the absorption features will always be located in the ly@xmath0 forest where they are subject to heavy blending and blanketing by hi lines , making them difficult to identify , especially in high redshift spectra .",
    "a family of strong absorption lines from lower ionization states of oxygen is seen to be present for the higher column density lyfas .",
    "these lines all have @xmath101 , and can not ( for @xmath102 ) be observed in the optical .",
    "they present a challenge for the next generation of ultraviolet spectrographs .    for lines with @xmath9 , the civ(1548,1551 )",
    "doublet is seen to be dominant over the entire range of hi column densities , a remarkable result , given that this range in @xmath1 spans three orders of magnitude in volume density and hence photoionization parameter . only for hi column densities close to that of lyman limit systems ( @xmath103 )",
    "do other metal lines , such as the siiv(1394,1403 ) doublet , attain strengths comparable to that of civ .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the fact that the first metal lines found to be associated with lyfas were civ lines , and that civ systems are the best studied and most numerously observed metal line systems to date .",
    "the lines with @xmath104 reaching the largest lox values are ciii(977 ) and siiii(1206 ) . in the high column density",
    "lyfas these lines are predicted to be so strong that the prospects of detecting them in the ly@xmath0 forest should be reasonable , and they have indeed been observed in a few lyfas in the q1422 spectrum ( sc 96 ) .",
    "these lines deserve a more thorough investigation with artificial absorption spectra . a good way of testing simulation predictions for high column density lyfas would be to compare ciii absorption in real spectra to the ciii features in a model with [ c / h ] determined observationally from the corresponding civ features .    figures 3 and 4 show graphical representations of the @xmath1-lox relations for 12 lines selected from table 1 . in low density regions , the lox is insensitive to the scatter in gas temperature , because photoionization is much more important than collisional ionization and because the recombination coefficients are not very temperature sensitive .",
    "a more complicated issue is what would happen if the _",
    "mean _ temperature of the low density gas were different in the model , for example because of a different assumption about the heat input during the reionization period ( hui & gnedin 1997 ; rauch et al .",
    "the effect on the lox is small in this case also , as we will argue in detail in section 4 .",
    "figure 3 contains lines from three different ionization states of carbon and silicon .",
    "the civ(1548 ) , ciii(997 ) , and cii(1335 ) lines are expected to be observable in absorbers with @xmath105 , 14.9 , and 15.8 , respectively .",
    "these values are obtained assuming a resolution and s / n similar to that of sc s spectrum of q1422 + 231 , and a metallicity of [ o / h]=-2.5 .",
    "it is straightforward to predict these values for spectra of other resolutions and signal - to - noise ratios by means of equation ( [ declimit ] ) , and for other metallicities by shifting the lox - curves upwards by an amount @xmath106(lox ) = [ o / h]+2.5 ( or alternatively sliding the horizontal detection limit lines downwards by the same amount ) .",
    "for example , for civ to be detectable in a lyfa with @xmath107 in the sc spectrum , one can estimate from figure 3 that [ o / h ] would have to be @xmath108 .",
    "the diagonal arrows on figure 3 indicate how the curves will shift if @xmath109 is multiplied by a factor of 2 ( solid arrow ) or if @xmath110 is changed from 0.0125 to 0.02 and @xmath109 is adjusted to maintain the observed @xmath111 ( dashed arrow ) . the direction and magnitude of these arrows can be derived from approximate scaling laws , as will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "the modeling of the ionization correction term in the lox is based on a single - density model , assuming that most of the absorption takes place at or near the maximum of the local density peak associated with a lyfa .",
    "this is certainly true for hi .",
    "as long as the volume density of a species @xmath31 increases with total density ( i.e. the lox increases with @xmath1 ) this assumption holds . in situations where @xmath31 decreases with total density",
    "this approximation becomes worse .",
    "for example , in our artificial spectra we sometimes see that the cii(1335 ) feature associated with a high column density absorber ( @xmath112 ) is centered on the same velocity as hi , whereas the corresponding civ ( or ovi ) absorption is seen as shoulders that are offset relative to the hi feature .",
    "this occurs because the civ density profile does not follow that of the total density .",
    "therefore , our maximum density assumption causes us to underestimate the lox values on the decreasing parts of the curves in figures 3 - 4 .",
    "they are lower limits to the true lox values , and it is necessary to do a full generation and analysis of artificial spectra if one wants to use , say , observed cii / civ ratios to infer ionization properties of the igm",
    ". direct comparison to the lox values in figure 3 would overestimate the photoionization parameter in the central region of the lyfa .",
    "figure 3 also shows the silicon lines siiv(1394 ) , siiii(1206 ) , and siii(1260 ) . here , the siiv and siiii features are observable only for @xmath113 , and the siii feature for @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , the siii line falls redward of the ly@xmath0 forest only for lyfas close to the ly@xmath0 emission peak . clearly , for most lyfas these silicon lines are not as promising for probing ionization conditions as the carbon lines discussed above .",
    "lines from the family of very strong o transitions oiii(833 ) , oiv(788 ) , ov(630 ) , and ovi(1032 ) , as well as nv(1239 ) and svi(1063 ) , are displayed in figure 4 .",
    "ovi is by far the strongest high ionization line with @xmath104 , and it is observable in the entire interval @xmath115 . for systems with @xmath116 , ovi should be detectable in the sc spectrum , provided @xmath88 { \\mathrel{\\copy\\simgreatbox}}-3}$ ] . in our model , the ovi is produced mainly from photoionization , and the lox is not very sensitive to the assumed temperature . with present day spectra , ovi is the best and only candidate for probing the metallicity of the igm in regions close to the mean density .",
    "as we already mentioned , observations of the ovi lines are hampered by the high line density within the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "low column density lines in cosmological simulations are usually broadened by hubble flow and peculiar velocities rather than thermal motions , so the ovi lines may not necessarily be distinguishable by low @xmath117-parameters . in individual cases , however , it should at least be possible to place upper limits to the metallicity of the systems that happen not to have strong hi contamination at the expected positions of the ovi features .",
    "the nv(1239,1243 ) is predicted to be weaker than the ovi doublet and probe a somewhat denser part of the igm . if [ n / c ] is as low as -0.7 as suggested by pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the nv doublet will be observable only in lyfas with relatively high metallicity , roughly @xmath118 { \\mathrel{\\copy\\simgreatbox}}-1.8 $ ] .",
    "this seems consistent with the fact that sc observed nv in only one out of six candidate absorbers in their ly@xmath119 selected sample .    towards lower redshifts , where the ly@xmath0 forest begins to thin out",
    ", it should become increasingly easy to identify ovi absorption lines by their coincidence with corresponding ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath119 absorption , at least in a statistical way .",
    "though somewhat arduous , this type of investigation with ovi is probably the most promising route to testing the trend between metallicity and hi column density predicted by some models of early igm enrichment ( e.g. , gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 present lox results for a single redshift and a single set of model parameters : @xmath47cdm at @xmath53 , with @xmath120 and the haardt - madau ( 1997 ) uv background spectrum scaled in intensity to give an hi photoionization rate @xmath121 such that @xmath61 in the simulated spectra .",
    "however , we can estimate the effects of changing some of these parameters by simple scaling arguments because the dynamics of the gas in the density regime relevant to lyfas is driven by the gravity of the dark matter , making the spatial distribution of the gas insensitive to changes in @xmath122 , @xmath36 , or the igm temperature .",
    "we can therefore compute the effects of such changes on the @xmath123 vs. @xmath69 correlation ( figure  [ figcolnh ] ) , and we can compute the effect on lox values through equation  ( [ lox ] ) if we make the approximation that the ionization fractions @xmath124 depend only on the ionization parameter @xmath125 . because recombination rates vary only slowly with temperature and the range of temperatures in lyfas is much smaller than the range of densities , this is a good , but not a perfect , approximation .",
    "consider first the effect of changing @xmath36 by a constant factor @xmath126 .",
    "this change in isolation would alter the mean flux decrement @xmath111 , which we have thus far adopted as an observational constraint on the model , but current observational uncertainties in @xmath111 allow some range in @xmath36 ( compare , e.g. , zuo & lu 1993 to press et al .  1993 and rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , and comparison of simulated and observed hi column density distributions favors a somewhat higher value of @xmath36 than we have adopted here ( dav et al .  1997 ; gnedin 1997a ) .",
    "we assume that the shape of @xmath36 does not change , so that the photoionization rates @xmath127 for all species change by the same factor .",
    "an absorber that previously had column density @xmath128 now has a column density @xmath129  raising @xmath36 lowers the hydrogen neutral fraction and therefore lowers @xmath123 .",
    "the density @xmath69 in this absorber is the same as before , so the ionization parameters @xmath130 are the same as those in an absorber that previously had column density @xmath131 .",
    "we have used the correlation @xmath132 from figure  [ figcolnh ] to convert a factor @xmath133 change in @xmath69 to a factor @xmath134 change in @xmath123 . assuming that @xmath135 depends only on @xmath130 , we see from equation  ( [ lox ] ) that @xmath136 where the second term accounts for the difference @xmath137 .",
    "for example , the effect of doubling @xmath36 while keeping other parameters fixed is to shift the lox@xmath138 curves diagonally by the vector ( 0.13,0.13 ) , indicated by the solid arrow in figure  3 .",
    "the magnitude of this shift is small , and the direction is nearly parallel to the lox curve itself .",
    "the same shift would apply to figure  4 .    if we keep @xmath36 fixed but change @xmath122 by a factor @xmath126 , then absorber densities @xmath69 change by @xmath126 and column densities by @xmath139 ( because the hydrogen neutral fraction is itself proportional to @xmath69 ) .",
    "an absorber that previously had column density @xmath128 now has @xmath140 .",
    "the ionization parameters are the same as those in an absorber that previously had column density @xmath141 with the same reasoning as before , we find @xmath142    since the observational constraints on @xmath111 are better than those on the ionizing background intensity , a factor @xmath126 change in @xmath122 should really be accompanied by a factor @xmath139 change in @xmath36 , so that @xmath111 and the hi column densities of absorbers remain the same .",
    "the net change is to increase @xmath130 by a factor of @xmath126 at fixed @xmath123 .",
    "an absorber with column density @xmath123 has the same ionization parameters as an absorber that previously had column density @xmath143 .",
    "thus , @xmath144 for example , the dashed arrow in figure  3 shows the effect of increasing @xmath122 from the value @xmath145 used in our simulation to the value @xmath146 favored ( for @xmath147 ) by the low [ d / h ] value of tytler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "plausible variations in the assumed gas reionization history can alter the temperature of the low density igm by factors @xmath148 ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ; hui & gnedin 1997 ) . because the hi recombination coefficients are @xmath149 for @xmath150k , a factor @xmath126 change in gas temperatures requires a factor @xmath151 change in @xmath36 to keep @xmath111 fixed . from the scaling relation  ( [ scal1 ] ) , we see that the impact of such a temperature change would be small .    to estimate the evolution of the lox with redshift",
    ", we can appeal to the argument of hernquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the primary driver of evolution in the ly@xmath0 forest at high redshift is the expansion of the universe , which changes the cosmic mean density in proportion to @xmath152 .",
    "non - linear gravitational evolution changes the overdensity field @xmath153 , but this evolution has a smaller impact on the forest than the overall expansion , at least for low column density absorbers . matching the observed evolution of @xmath111 requires an hi photoionization rate @xmath121 that is roughly constant between @xmath154 and @xmath39 ( hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , so if we ignore changes to the shape of the spectrum we can take @xmath36 to be constant over this interval .",
    "a factor of two _ decrease _ in @xmath152  roughly the change between @xmath154 and @xmath53 or between @xmath53 and @xmath39  has the same effect as a factor of two _ increase _ in @xmath36 at a given redshift , illustrated by the solid arrow in figure  3 .",
    "while this argument is only approximate , it is enough to show that the lox should not vary strongly with redshift over the range @xmath155 , except in the case of ionic species that are affected by the change in the spectral shape of @xmath36 .",
    "structure formation models that have a power spectrum amplitude similar to that of @xmath47cdm on mpc scales at @xmath53 will predict similar spatial and density structure in the diffuse igm .",
    "( models with very different power spectra will of course predict different structure , but such models may soon be ruled out by the ly@xmath0 forest data themselves [ see , e.g. , discussions by rauch et al .  1997 ;",
    "gnedin 1997b ; croft et al .",
    "if the baryon density @xmath73 is held fixed , then the most important effect of changing the cosmological model is to alter the expansion rate @xmath156 .",
    "matching @xmath111 requires @xmath157 ( see , e.g. , equation  [ 2 ] of rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , so halving @xmath156 has the same impact as doubling @xmath36 . in practice",
    "the difference between @xmath156 values in currently popular models at @xmath158 is less than a factor of two , so the expected impact is small .",
    "we conclude that our quantitative predictions for the lox are likely to hold rather generally in the cosmological picture of lyfas , at least for column densities @xmath159 , where the scaling arguments used in this section are most secure .",
    "our comparison of two numerical simulation models , a standard cdm model and a @xmath47cdm model , supports this claim , and it does not show any major changes to the lox predictions even for higher column densities . of course , the lox is always directly affected by the metallicity of the absorbing gas ( equation  [ [ lox ] ] ) , and the insensitivity to cosmology implies that absorption observations can therefore yield robust estimates of the metallicity in different regions of the igm .",
    "ionization corrections are essential in the interpretation of such measurements , but the corrections are not strongly dependent on the assumed cosmological model .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the lox , a measure that allows a comprehensive selection of the metal lines that are useful for testing the detailed predictions of models for lyfas .",
    "we have applied this method to a particular model , a cosmological @xmath47cdm simulation , and we have quantitatively discussed the dependence of the results on the model parameters @xmath109 , @xmath160 , and @xmath87 . we have also performed this analysis for a different cosmological simulation , a standard cdm model , but the results differ negligibly from those of the @xmath47cdm model .",
    "we find that very few detectable metal lines are associated with the low to moderate density regions of the igm that give rise to absorbers with @xmath161 .",
    "most of the baryons in the universe at @xmath53 are believed to reside in this part of the igm ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the ovi(1032,1038 ) doublet is found to be the best probe of the metallicity in these regions .",
    "other strong o lines , such as ov(630 ) , oiv(788 ) , and oiii(833 ) are technically difficult to observe , and have yet to be detected .",
    "the ciii(977 ) and siiii(1206 ) lines are the strongest metal lines in high column density lyfas .",
    "the civ(1548 ) line is the strongest metal line with @xmath162 for all lyfas with @xmath163 . while the specific values of the lox as a function of column density will depend on redshift and on the adopted cosmological model and radiation field ,",
    "we have argued that the qualitative conclusions presented above are insensitive to the choice of cosmological model of high redshift lyfas , and they should hold generally within this scenario .",
    "the relatively uncommon absorbers with @xmath82 should offer the strongest test of cosmological simulations .",
    "these systems should have more than a dozen observable metal lines associated with them ( for @xmath88 } \\sim -2.5 $ ] ) .",
    "the relative strengths of these lines will depend on the assumed radiation field and abundance pattern , so a first check would be whether it is possible to make the line strengths in the model spectra match those of lines associated with high column density lyfas for reasonable values of model parameters . then one should make a detailed examination of the relative locations in velocity space between absorption components of individual species . a detailed comparison to observations will ultimately determine if the resolution of the simulations is adequate in these high - density regions , and to what extent local dynamical effects associated with the production of metals can be neglected .",
    "there are some hints of discrepancies between models and observations for these high column density systems .",
    "for example , the models in some cases predict the velocity components of civ and cii absorption lines to differ , whereas there seems to be some new observational evidence that cii and civ components are found at the same positions ( a. boksenberg , private communication ) .",
    "cosmological simulations depict the typical low column density lyfas as simple structures : low density , smooth , and governed by the straightforward physics of gravity , cosmic expansion , and photoionization .",
    "studies of absorption along parallel lines of sight provide direct observational support for this point of view , especially recent hires observations of gravitationally lensed qsos that set stringent lower limits to the scale of any substructure within low column density absorbers ( rauch 1997 ; see also smette et al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "the simulations do not predict a sudden change in lyfa properties at any particular column density , but they do predict a steady increase of gas density with @xmath1 ( fig .  1 ) . for @xmath164 ,",
    "the typical absorbers are partially collapsed structures , and gas within them has begun to experience radiative cooling . in this regime ,",
    "the finite mass and spatial resolution of the simulations may limit the accuracy of the results , and local astrophysical processes such as star formation and supernova explosions might influence the structure of these systems .",
    "the standard cdm model studied here produces only about 1/3 of the observed number of lyman limit systems ( @xmath165 ) , even though it matches the abundance of much stronger , damped ly@xmath0 absorbers quite well ( katz et al .",
    "1996b ; gardner et al .",
    "1997 ) . while further work is needed to assess the sensitivity of this result to cosmological parameters",
    " especially the baryon density parameter @xmath122  the discrepancy of numbers suggests that a population of absorbers unresolved by the simulations may become important at column densities @xmath166 .",
    "the high column density lyfas in the cosmological simulations represent the transition between the weak igm fluctuations traced by low column density lines and the cold gas concentrations in virialized dark halos traced by damped ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the high - lox lines listed in table  1 can reveal many details of the structure and physical conditions in these absorbers , testing the accuracy of the simulations in this regime , providing clues to the nature of any additional absorber populations , and capturing snapshots of gas as it makes its way from the igm into high redshift galaxies .",
