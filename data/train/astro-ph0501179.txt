    "formation of galactic spheroids remains as a major unsolved problem in astronomy .",
    "this is an important problem , specially if one takes into account that at least half of the stars in the local universe are in spheroids : either bulges or ellipticals ( e.g. , fukugita , hoggan & peebles 1998 ; bell et al .",
    "the key question is how and where these stars formed .",
    "one possibility is that stars in present - day spheroids were formed in a self - regulated quiescent fashion characteristic of galactic discs , and then the disc stars were dynamically heated by mergers and/or secular disc processes . in this case",
    "the spheroid formation is predominantly collisionless .",
    "another possibility is that spheroid star formation ( sf ) was highly dissipative and proceeded in a violent , possibly bursting and dust enshrouded mode during a dissipative disc merging event or during a phase of fast gas ( monolithic ) collapse .",
    "although both possibilities happen certainly in the real universe , it is important to evaluate the feasibility of each one as well as the physical / evolutionary context in which one or another possibility dominates . in the former case the sf rate is traced by uv / optical emission , while in the latter by fir / submillimetre emission .",
    "thus , understanding the mechanisms of spheroid formation and the regimes of formation of their stars is of crucial relevance for interpreting and modeling the contribution of present - day stars in spheroids to the cosmic sf rate history .      in this paper",
    "we will study some aspects of the disc secular evolution . according to the secular scenario",
    ", the formation of a central mass concentration ( a bar or a pseudobulge ) happens in a predominantly dissipationless fashion in the course of development of gravitational instabilities in the central region of a galactic stellar disc .",
    "the evolution of the bar can give rise to a central component that is denser and thicker than the initial thin stellar disc ( kormendy 1979 , 1982 ) .",
    "in earlier simulations the bar in most of cases was dissolving , leaving behind a pseudobulge ( e.g. , combes & sanders 1981 ; pfenniger & norman 1990 ; combes et al . 1990 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; norman , sellwood & hassan 1996 ) .",
    "however , more recent simulations , which have many more particles and have more realistic setup , do not produce typically decaying bars ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; oneill & dubinsky 2003 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 , hereafter vk03 ; shen & sellwood 2003 ; debattista et al .",
    "2004 ) . in those simulations bars",
    "typically slightly grow over billions of years .    in the vk03 simulations of discs",
    "inside live cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes , the redistribution of the angular momentum of the stellar disc is driven by the evolving bar and by interactions with the dark matter halo .",
    "this evolution produces a dense central mass concentration with nearly exponential profile , which resembles surface brightness profiles of late - type galaxy bulges ( see also athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; oneill & dubinsky 2003 ) .",
    "shen & sellwood ( 2003 ) and debattista et al . ( 2004 ) argued that neither a small central mass concentration ( e.g. black hole ) nor the buckling instability are efficient enough to destroy a bar .    whether the bar is destroyed or not , the heating of the central parts of the stellar disc and accumulation of mass at the centre are common features in all models of secular evolution . further exploration , including a wide range of realistic initial conditions and inclusion of processes such as gas infall ( e.g. , bournaud & combes 2002 ) , minor mergers and satellites ( aguerri et al . 2001 ) , hydrodynamics , sf and feedback are certainly necessary .",
    "all the processes are likely to play some role in evolution of galaxies . here",
    "we intentionally do not include these complex processes in order to isolate the effects of the secular evolution : we include only stellar and dark matter components and do not consider any external effects",
    ".    models of secular disc evolution gradually find their place in the theory of galaxy formation .",
    "encouraging results were obtained when a prescription for secular bulge formation was incorporated in cdm semi - analytical models of disc galaxy formation and evolution ( avila - reese & firmani 2000,1999 ; see also van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "these models successfully reproduce the observed correlations of the bulge - to - disc ratio with other global properties for late - type galaxies .",
    "secular disc evolution should be considered as a complementary path of spheroid formation rather than a concurring alternative to the dissipative merging mechanism .    from the observational side ,",
    "an increasing evidence shows that structural , kinematic , and chemical properties of the bulges of late - type galaxies are tightly related with properties of the inner discs ( for reviews and references see wyse , gilmore & franx 1997 ; macarthur , courteau & holtzmann 2003 ; carrollo 2004 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . besides , bars  signature of secular evolution ",
    "are observed in a large fraction of spiral galaxies .",
    "these pieces of evidence strongly favor the secular evolution scenario .      according to the liouville s theorem , in a collisionless system the phase - space density @xmath4",
    "is preserved along trajectories of individual stars .",
    "thus , one expects that a collisionless system `` remembers '' its initial distribution of @xmath4 , and this can be used to test the secular evolution scenario .",
    "in fact what is `` observed '' is not @xmath4 , but a rough estimate of the coarsely grained phase - space density @xmath5 where , @xmath1 is stellar density and @xmath6 are radial , tangential , and vertical rms velocities of stars .",
    "the coarse - grained phase - space density is not preserved .",
    "still , there are significant constraints on the evolution of , which are imposed by the mixing theorem ( tremaine , henon , lynden - bell 1986 ) .",
    "the process that changes   is the mixing . bringing and mixing together two patches of stars with different fine - grained phase - densities result in , which is lower than the maximum phase - space density of the two patches . in other words ,",
    "the mixing results in reducing .",
    "the only way to increase   is to bring in stars with initially large . indeed , when a bar forms , there is a substantial radial infall of mass to the central region . yet , this does not help much because the bar is formed from the central region of the disc where the initial   is low .",
    "additional mixing produced by the bar seems to make the things even worse by lowering down already low .",
    "simple estimates for elliptical and spiral galaxies indicate that the coarse - grained phase space - densities in spirals are lower than in ellipticals ( carlberg 1986 ) , making difficult to produce elliptical galaxies by merging of stellar discs ( hernquist , spergel & heyl 1993 ) .",
    "wyse ( 1998 ) discussed similar arguments but for the galactic disc in the context of the secular bulge formation scenario .",
    "for an exponential disc with constant height @xmath7 and with an isotropic velocity - dispersion tensor one finds that @xmath8 ( @xmath9h@xmath10)/(@xmath11h@xmath10)@xmath12 , where @xmath11 and @xmath13 are the disc central surface brightness and scale - length radius , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is lower toward the centre .",
    "wyse ( 1998 ) then states : `` one should not find a higher phase - space density in stellar progeny , formed by a collisionless process , than in its stellar progenitor '' .",
    "observational inferences for our galaxy show actually that   is higher in the bulge than in the inner disc .",
    "this discrepancy led wyse ( 1998 ) to conclude that the secular scenario has a serious difficulty , unless dissipative physics is included .",
    "the problem is partially mitigated if one considers that the toomre parameter @xmath14 is constant along the initial disc .",
    "for @xmath15const , the rms velocity is @xmath16 , where the epicycle frequency @xmath17 increases as @xmath18 decreases . in this case",
    "@xmath19 has an @xmath20shaped profile with a maximum at the centre ( lake 1989 ) and a valley in the inner regions . how steep or shallow is this valley depends on the inner behavior of @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is actually more complicated than the simple picture outlined above because of the spacial and dynamical properties of the system evolve .",
    "formation of bars is a complex process that affects a large fraction of the disc  not just the central region .",
    "thus , to study the overall evolution of @xmath3 one needs to turn to numerical simulations .",
    "the main question , which we address in this paper is how the macroscopic ( observational ) phase - space density profile , , of stellar discs inside cdm haloes evolves during the formation ( and potential dissolution ) of a bar , and whether the shape of this profile agrees with estimates from observed disc / bar / bulge galaxy systems .",
    "we analyze state - of - the - art high - resolution n - body simulations of galaxy - like discs embedded in live cdm haloes . the secular evolution of the disc in these simulations yields bars that redistribute particles and produce a dynamically hot mass central concentration .    in  2 we present a brief description of the simulations and the procedure to estimate the phase - space density .",
    "the results are given in  3 , and in  4 we discuss some aspects of the simulations . in ",
    "5 a comparison with observational estimates is presented .",
    "our summarizing conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "we study four n - body simulations for evolution of bars in stellar discs embedded in live cdm haloes .",
    "two simulations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are taken from vk03 and the other two , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are from klypin et al .",
    "the models were chosen to cover some range of initial conditions and parameters , with the aim to test the sensitivity of the results to them .",
    "for example , the initial toomre parameter @xmath14 is constant along the disc for models @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the @xmath14 parameter is variable for model @xmath22 ( increases in the central regions ) . instead , this model is initially set to have a radial velocity dispersion as @xmath26h@xmath27 . as the result",
    ", all the models have different initial profiles of the azimutally averaged coarsely grained phase - space density .",
    "parameters of the models and details of simulations are presented in table 1 .",
    ".parameters of models [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we studied the evolution of the observational measure of the coarsely grained phase - space density , , in high - resolution n - body simulations of galaxy - like models embedded in live cdm halos . in our models",
    "the initially thin stellar disc is unstable .",
    "as the system evolves , a bar with almost exponential density profile is produced .",
    "the bar redistributes matter in such a way that the disc ends with a high accumulation of mass in the centre and and extended outer disc with a density profile shallower than the exponential law . during the secular evolution ,",
    "the disc is also dynamically heated and thickened , mainly in the inner parts where a bulge - like structure ( peanut - shaped bar or pseudobulge ) arises .",
    "the secular evolution produces dramatic changes in the radial distribution of the coarsely grained phase - space density ( r ) .",
    "as the disc is heated and expanded vertically , ( r ) decreases at every radius @xmath18 .",
    "the outer region of the bar produces a large phase mixing in the inner disc larger than at the centre . as the result ,",
    "the ( r ) profile develops an increasing with time valley , with a pronounced minimum in the inner disc , where the central , bulge - like mass concentration ends . in this region",
    "the vertical heating and the radial mass exchange in the disc are maximum .",
    "our results on the evolution and shape of the  profile are qualitatively robust against initial conditions and assumptions , numerical resolution , and the way of measuring the volume density and dispersion velocities .",
    "we conclude that the secular evolution of a _ collisionless",
    "_ galactic disc is able to form a thick , dynamically hot , central mass concentration ( eventually a pseudobulge ) , where the phase - space density is much higher than in the inner disc .",
    "using observational data we have estimated   at several radii for the galaxy . in particular we estimated the   bulge - to - inner disc ratio .",
    "the qualitative agreement with our numerical results is remarkable .",
    "therefore , the secular evolution of a collisionless disc yields a radial coarsely grained phase - space density profile in agreement with that it is observationally inferred for the galaxy .",
    "the phase - space density constraints favor the bulge secular formation scenario .",
    "the inclusion of other important physical ingredients , as gas dissipative effects and satellite accretion , will likely enhance the secular evolution of disc models .",
