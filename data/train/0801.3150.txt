    "this radio emission appeared cometary - like , interpreted to be pointing away from the high mass star within a particular scenario , and no relativistic motion , nor halos , nor larger - scale structures were detected at any phase of the orbit .",
    "based on these findings , @xcite concluded that the radio and tev emissions from  are originated by the interaction of the wind of a young pulsar with that of the stellar companion @xcite .    in this article , we present and discuss the results of a multi - wavelength campaign including radio , x - ray , and tev @xmath6-ray observations on , aimed at shedding light on the physical processes going on in the system , as well as yielding useful input for a detailed , time - dependent modeling of this relevant system .",

    "the merlin array included six antennas ( defford , cambridge , knockin , darnhall , jodrell bank ( mkii ) , and tabley ) for most of our observations , yielding synthesized beams of about 50 to 70  mas ( corresponding to projected linear sizes of 100 to 140 au ) .",

    "data reduction of the x - ray observations of  have been performed using the _ chandra _ x - ray center software ciao v3.4 .",
    "the data reduction included the application of standard filters and rejection of events with bad grades and those originating from bad pixels .",
    "the background count rate is consistent with the quiescent background ( markevitch 2001 ) , and no time intervals of enhanced background needed to be removed .",
    "the processed observations have a useful exposure time of 19.1 ks . due to the high count rate of out - of - time events were not negligible and produced a noticeable streak along the columns .",

    "observations in the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath6-ray band ( @xmath18 gev ) were scheduled with the magic telescope on 2628 october and 1619 november 2006 ( see table  [ tbl - log ] ) .",
    "these observations are part of an extensive , standalone observing campaign carried out between september and december 2006 @xcite .",
    "bad weather conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , however , prevented us from obtaining useful data on 26 and 28 october 2006 .",
    "the observations were carried out in the false - source track ( wobble ) mode @xcite , with two directions at @xmath19 distance and opposite sides of the source direction , which allows for a reliable estimation of the background with no need of extra observation time .",

    "in this section we present the results obtained from the different multi - wavelength observations we have performed , and put them into the context of the past measurements in the different bands .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tbl - log ] and figure  [ fig : obs ] .",
    "the total radio flux density obtained with merlin shows a decline between october 26 ( @xmath20 ) and 28 ( @xmath21 ) , from @xmath22 to @xmath23 mjy , and a peak on 18 november ( @xmath24 ) at @xmath25 mjy . at the superorbital phase of the observations ( @xmath11 ) the radio source is in the weak state .",
    "the predicted flux of the radio flux is between 50100 mjy at the orbital phases @xmath26 .",
    "we therefore measure a flux compatible with the predicted one , although at a much earlier phase value .",
    "however , for the weak state , secondary peaks of comparable flux show up at other orbital phase values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : radio ] we show the radio images corresponding to 2526 of october , where all three arrays observed simultaneously . in figure",
    "[ fig : merlin ] we show the merlin images obtained on 27 and 28 october 2006 at 5.0 ghz , and on 16 through 20 november at 6.0 ghz .",
    "our merlin observations show no evidence for large angular scale structures , contrary to what had been previously claimed @xcite , hence excluding the existence of persistent jets at these scales .",
    "the structure of  genuinely follows the beam shape of the merlin array at all epochs .",
    "model fits to the @xmath27 plane of the merlin data show that the projected intrinsic size of the radio emitting region of  is , at any observing epoch , no larger than @xmath16  mas ( @xmath112 au ) , as confirmed by our higher resolution images obtained with the evn and the vlba .",
    "our 5 ghz vlba images on 25 and 26 october show a very bright and unresolved component plus an extended radio emission to the east - southeast ( see figure  [ fig : radio ] ) .",
    "the general aspect of the radio emission recalls the structure found by @xcite . in fact , panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : radio ] shows both our 5 ghz vlba image on 25 october 2006 ( @xmath28 , contours ) overlaid on top of the 8.4 ghz vlba data on 2 february 2006 ( @xmath28 , grey scale ) , kindly provided by v.  dhawan in advance of publication .",
    "the projected distance from the peak of the radio brightness distribution to the edge of the extended region is , as imaged with the vlba at 5.0 ghz on 26 october 2006 , of about @xmath18.2  mas ( 16.4  au ) .",
    "if the maximum time to fill in this region with radio ( synchrotron ) emitting particles is less that the time spanned by our two consecutive vlba observations ( 1 day ) , the implied outflow velocity is at least of 21500  km / s , or @xmath29  c.    the coordinates of the peak of radio brightness distribution of , as obtained from our vlba observations ( using task imfit ) , were @xmath30 , @xmath31 on october 25 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 on october 26 , with and estimated accuracy of 12@xmath34as and 7@xmath34as in ra and dec , respectively .",
    "this shift of the brightness peak corresponds to a day - to - day projected speed of 904@xmath1260 , in excellent agreement with the typical value of @xmath11000  found by @xcite along a complete orbital cycle .",
    "the peak flux density varied significantly between our two vlba observing runs , decreasing from 24.3 mjy / b on october 25 to 15.4 mjy / b on october 26 . the total 5  ghz flux density varied from 39.5@xmath120.2 mjy ( radio luminosity @xmath35 ) to 32.7@xmath120.2 mjy ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the drop seen in the total radio flux density of  between our two consecutive vlba observations is directly related to the change in the peak flux density , which hints towards a physical link with structural variations in the innermost ( @xmath373  mas projected radius , or 6 au at a distance of 2  kpc ) region of the source , which our observations can not resolve .",
    "is clearly detected in our _ chandra _ observation , with a background - subtracted averaged count rate of 1.067@xmath120.008 cnts  s@xmath38 in the energy band 0.510.0 kev .",
    "this count rate would have indeed resulted in considerable pile - up for a standard observational setup .",
    "the x - ray spectrum ( figure  [ xspec ] ) shows a broad peak at @xmath11.6 kev and a hard energy tail that extends up to 9 kev . assuming a foreground interstellar absorption with solar abundances and the absorption cross - sections of @xcite , the x - ray spectrum of  can be reasonably well fitted by either an absorbed power law , or an absorbed bremsstrahlung model ( fig .",
    "[ xspec ] ) .",

    "for the rest of the nights , no detection above 2@xmath95 was found , and we derived the corresponding upper limits to the integral flux ( see table  [ tbl - log ] ) .",
    "on october 27 , the measured average flux above 300 gev corresponds to 15@xmath83 of the crab nebula flux at these energies .",

    "no significant variations of the absolute flux were detected within that night .",
    "previous observations of this source with the magic @xcite and veritas @xcite telescopes have shown a point - like source , with a peak of @xmath98 crab flux intensity at orbital phase @xmath99 , and a spectral index @xmath100 , hence in agreement with the results derived from our observations .",
    "the comparison between vhe @xmath6-ray and radio data during the october campaign ( see figure  [ fig : obs ] ) shows a detection at tev energies for @xmath20 with a flux level of @xmath101 of the crab nebula flux , during a period when the radio emission is constant at 35 mjy . during the november campaign , however , there is no detection at tev energies , while the radio data show a peak flux twice as high as in october .",
    "@xcite reported on radio and tev peaks detected almost simultaneously , while for our campaing we see the tev peak for a flat and low radio flux and a radio peak for no significant tev emission .",
    "therefore , we exclude a general tev - radio correlation .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the emissions are produced by different particle populations .",
    "on the other hand , the detections at x - ray and tev energies , both at particularly high flux values and one day apart , might point to a correlation between x - ray and tev fluxes , and hence to the fact that both radiations are produced by the same population of particles . yet , our data are too scarce to make any solid conclusion at present .",
    "the results obtained by radio imaging at different angular scales show that the size of the radio emitting region of  is constrained below @xmath16  mas ( @xmath112 projected au ) , and the presence of persistent jets above this scale is therefore excluded .",
    "we resolve a radio - emitting region at 5.0 ghz with vlba , extending east - southeast from the brighter , unresolved emitting core .",
    "the outflow velocity implied by our observations is at least of @xmath10.1  c , in agreement to what previously suggested by @xcite , for an over - pressured pulsar wind , although recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite show that the shocked pulsar wind could be relativistic .",
    "the comparison of our vlba image from 25 october with an image at 8.4 ghz obtained at a similar orbital phase but 10 orbital cycles apart shows a high level of similarity between them .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite obtained high - resolution radio images of the source along a complete orbital cycle , and found an extended feature whose orientation with respect to the central core varied by @xmath102 along the orbit .",
    "therefore , the similarity in the morphology and orientation between both images suggests a significant level of periodicity and stability of the physical processes involved in the radio emission .",
    "this result points to the fact that the extended radio emission is produced by the interaction of steady flows ( from a relativistic pulsar wind , jet and/or stellar wind ) rather than by the interaction of such an outflow with wind clumps .",
    "we note that if the radio emission is produced by a milliarcsecond scale jet , the required stability and periodic behavior of such a jet is difficult to reconcile with the non - persistent nature of a large scale ( @xmath1100 mas ) , putative relativistic jet , as deduced from our merlin observations in combination with those obtained by @xcite .    finally , we combine our x - ray data from 25 october , the tev data from 26 october and the average vlba in both nights to produce a quasi - simultaneous multi - wavelength spectrum , including radio , x - ray and vhe @xmath6-ray observations , which we display in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "however , the simultaneous data cover only a small range of the orbital phase of . given the high variability of the physical conditions of the system along the orbit , more simultaneous , multiwavelength data , and particularly involving longer exposure times , orbital phase coverage and redundancy , will shed further light in our understanding of this peculiar object .",

    "<S> , we can exclude the existence of large scale ( @xmath0 mas ) persistent radio - jets . </S>",
    "<S> our 5.0 ghz vlba observations display morphological similarities to previous 8.4 ghz vlba observations carried out at the same orbital phase , suggesting a high level of periodicity and stability of the processes behind the radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it unlikely that variability of the radio emission is due to the interaction of an outflow with variable wind clumps . </S>",
    "<S> if the radio emission is produced by a milliarcsecond scale jet , it should also show a stable , periodic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is then difficult to reconcile the absence of a large scale jet ( @xmath1100 mas ) in our observations with the evidence of a persistent relativistic jet reported previously . </S>",
    "<S> we find a possible hint of temporal correlation between the x - ray and tev emissions and evidence for radio / tev non - correlation , which points to the existence of one population of particles producing the radio emission and a different one producing the x - ray and tev emissions </S>",
    "<S> . finally , we present a quasi - simultaneous energy spectrum including radio , x - ray and tev bands . </S>"
