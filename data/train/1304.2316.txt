    "emerging nuclear energy applications and nuclear theory require nuclear data on neutron - induced reactions at energies higher than thermal",
    ". however , the data on fission fragment mass yields are scarce at neutron energies above 10 mev .",

    "the incident neutron energy spectrum consisted of a high - energy peak produced by the @xmath2li(p , n)@xmath2be reaction and a low - energy tail containing about 50% of all produced neutrons .",

    "a multi - section frisch - gridded ionization chamber has been used to detect fission fragments and to measure their kinetic energies .",
    "the double kinetic energy ( 2e ) method was used to extract fission fragment mass yields . to determine the energy of a non - peak incident neutrons induced fission , we used the time - of - flight ( tof ) difference between them and the peak neutrons . due to a periodic structure of the cyclotron proton beam ,",
    "experimental fission fragment mass yields suffer from the contribution of low - energy neutrons ( up to 10% ) from the previous proton bursts .",

    "to select the intervals of incident neutron energy , we took into consideration the uncertainty @xmath3=3 ns of the incident neutron time - of - flight measurement as well as the incident neutron energy upper and lower limits set by the peak energy of the incident neutron energy spectrum and the cyclotron rf respectively .",
