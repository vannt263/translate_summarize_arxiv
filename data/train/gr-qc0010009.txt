    "the late stage evolution in a compact binary , when the component stars are under the influence of the strong gravitational fields of each other and are moving at relativistic speeds , is dictated by the non - linear dynamics of general relativity and is very difficult to model . in the early stages of adiabatic inspiral ( that is , when the inspiral time scale is much larger than the orbital time scale ) it is possible to treat the problem of motion perturbatively and to expand the general relativistic equations of motion and wave generation formulae in a power - series in @xmath2 @xmath3 being a characteristic velocity .",
    "( we henceforth use units such that @xmath4 . )",
    "however , the phasing of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal derived from these perturbative results becomes increasingly inadequate as the two bodies approach each other .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath5 corresponding to the peak of the detector sensitivity to the inspiral signal from a binary of total mass @xmath6 is numerically equal ( for initial ligo ; for which @xmath7 hz ) to @xmath8 . for a double neutron star system one",
    "already has @xmath9 , while , for an archetypal @xmath10 double black hole system one has @xmath11 , quite close to the velocity corresponding to the last stable orbit ( lso ) : @xmath12 .",
    "the present theoretical understanding has enabled the perturbative computation ( via post - newtonian expansions ) of the binary orbit and gw phase to an order @xmath13 beyond the standard quadrupole formula .",
    "we shall use these @xmath13-accurate results in this work . at present",
    ", we can not count on the ( hopeful ) extension of the post - newtonian ( pn ) perturbative calculations by another two orders , to order @xmath14 , because currently used pn techniques leave undetermined a physically crucial parameter entering at the @xmath15 level @xcite .",
    "moreover , as emphasized some time ago@xcite , the pn series ( which is essentially a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath3 ) is a rather poorly convergent expansion .",
    "more precisely , if one considers the pn expansion of the crucial gw flux ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of @xcite ) ,",
    "one notices that the @xmath16-accurate and @xmath13- accurate approximations start significantly deviating , in opposite directions , from the exact ( test - mass ) result when @xmath17 . as such relatively high values of @xmath3",
    "are typically involved in the calculation of the gw phasing ( @xmath18 as soon as @xmath19 ) , one has to worry that search templates based on a straightforward use of pn - expanded results might be inadequate for the detection and/or measurement of inspiral signals , especially for the more massive systems ( @xmath20 implies @xmath21 ) which are likely to be the first potentially detectable events .    to address this crucial problem ,",
    "we have been advocating @xcite a new philosophy for making the optimal use of existing pn results , namely , to use several _ re - summation techniques _ to improve the convergence of the pn series , before using them to compute the gw phasing . as of now , we have proposed and studied three successive stages in the definition and use of such re - summation techniques .",
    "first , we constructed @xcite _ time - domain _ signals , called p - approximants  starting from the standard pn taylor representation  which possess better convergence properties and capture the expected analytical behaviour ( poles and zeroes ) of the relevant physical quantities quite well .",
    "we have shown that these new signal models , when compared with standard pn signals , are both more _ effectual _ ( larger overlaps ) and more _ faithful _ ( smaller biases in the estimation of parameters ) representations of some fiducial `` exact '' signals . though _ time - domain _ p - approximants are better signal models than the standard `` taylor '' approximants , they are computationally expensive to use in a data analysis exercise that searches for inspiral signals using hundreds of thousands of templates , which have to be correlated , with arbitrary time lags , with the detector output .",
    "this data - analysis computational cost is much reduced ( thanks to the existence of efficient fft algorithms ) when one disposes of explicit analytic expressions for the fourier transform of the templates .",
    "second , we found @xcite explicit _ frequency - domain _ representations of p - approximants ( as well as of standard pn templates ) that are _ computationally inexpensive _ and are yet as _",
    "faithful _ and _ effectual _ as the original time - domain models .",
    "this frequency - domain representation incorporates the `` edge oscillations '' due to the ( assumed ) abrupt shut - off of the time - domain signal occurring soon after the binary crosses the last stable orbit . in @xcite we emphasized that the signal to noise ratio of the first interferometric detectors is large enough for detection only for massive binary black hole systems of total mass @xmath22 . for such systems",
    "the characteristic velocity corresponding to the peak of the detector sensitivity is @xmath23 , which is very close to @xmath24 , the velocity at the last stable orbit .",
    "one , therefore , expects that the first detections are most likely to concern massive of the snr , corresponding to a loss in the number of events by no more than @xmath25 implies that one must accurately control the phasing of the waveform at frequencies significantly higher than @xmath26 , corresponding to velocities significantly higher than @xmath27 . ]",
    "systems ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to push the re - summation techniques introduced in @xcite further so as to be able to describe not only the gw phasing during the last cycles before lso crossing , but also during the transition between inspiral and plunge , and during the plunge itself .",
    "recently , buonanno and damour @xcite combined some of the re - summation techniques of @xcite and @xcite with a novel approach to the general relativistic dynamics of two - body systems@xcite to devise an improved type of re - summation approach to the gw phasing of coalescing binaries , able to describe in more detail the transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "this `` effective one - body '' approach is the first one that goes beyond the `` adiabatic approximation '' , used both in standard ( non - resummed ) pn approximants , and in p - approximants .",
    "the data analysis of inspiral , merger and ring - down was pioneered by flanagan and hughes @xcite .",
    "they treated the problem of inspiral rather accurately but the merger / plunge was treated by assuming that about 10% of the rest mass energy would be emitted during merger .",
    "this quite optimistic estimate was based on a crude model of the coalescence of maximally spinning black holes , and was arbitrarily extended to all cases .",
    "a similar back - of - the - envelope consideration of the ring - down amplitude let them to optimistically assume that about 3% of the rest mass energy would be emitted during ring - down .    in this paper",
    "we discuss only non - spinning binaries and we make no ad hoc assumption about the total energy radiated during the merger phase .",
    "the effective one - body ( eob ) formalism does not treat the inspiral and plunge phases separately .",
    "indeed , in this formalism the plunge is seen as a natural continuation of the inspiral phase contributing ( for equal masses ) about 0.6 orbital cycles ( or 1.2 gw cycles ) , with a total energy associated with the plunge around 0.7% . the energy emitted during the following ( matched ) ring - down phase",
    "is also found to be around 0.7% @xcite .",
    "these energy losses are much smaller than the flanagan - hughes guesstimates of 10% and 3% , respectively .",
    "consequently , it is unlikely that we will be able to detect the plunge phase of the eob waveforms separately , irrespective of the mass of the system .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the flanagan - hughes claim that the snr contribution of the sole merger phase of massive black holes of total mass in the range 30 - 1000 @xmath30 will dominate over the inspiral phase contribution .",
    "note also that ( for a source at 100 mpc ) the ( merger - dominated ) snr of @xcite reaches a maximum of 40 around @xmath31 , while our ( inspiral - dominated ) snr reaches a maximum of 8 around @xmath32 .",
    "[ it seems that most of the difference between fig .",
    "4 of flanagan and hughes and our fig .",
    "[ fig : snr ] below , e.g. a factor 3 ( between their 25 and our 8) between the snr for a 80 @xmath30 source at 100 mpc , comes from the huge difference in energy loss during merger . ]    in this paper we make a prediction that the merger phase will enhance the inspiral phase snr by about 10% for @xmath33 , and by about 300% for @xmath32 , but that it will not be in itself a significant signal . as a result",
    "our best candidate sources are still stellar mass black hole binaries of total mass in the range 30 - 90 @xmath34 we also conclude that the ring - down phase is in itself not a significant contribution for @xmath35 .",
    "there is one word of caution regarding the plunge signal : even though the plunge lasts for only about half an orbital cycle its spectral content spreads over a large frequency range .",
    "consequently , the number of frequency bins over which the signal spreads out is quite large and it is not advisable to use a non - optimal method to try to detect the plunge part in isolation .",
    "in fact , we believe that one of the robust predictions of the eob approach ( at least in the case of slowly spinning holes ) is that the plunge signal is a smooth continuation of the inspiral one , and that one should use templates that are phase - coherent all over the inspiral - plus - plunge phase .",
    "we are aware of the approximate nature of the eob results ( especially beyond the lso ) and do not claim that the eob waveform is the last word on the problem , but our position is the following : ( i ) in absence of comparatively accurate alternative results , it is important to study in detail the predictions coming from the eob waveform , and ( ii ) we shall finally recommend to use a bank of filters which cover a large range of possibilities , with special weight being given to the best - tested `` resummed '' templates .",
    "we also hope that our work will give an additional incentive to numerical relativity groups toward computing waveforms which are at least as accurate ( and physically complete ) as the eob one .",
    "in particular , let us recall that @xcite has proposed a new approach to the numerical computation of binary black hole coalescences : namely , to start the numerical evolution just after lso crossing , i.e. at a stage where one can still trust the _ resummed _ pn estimate of the dynamics of two black holes , but where there is only 0.6 orbit to evolve before coalescence . to this aim ref .",
    "@xcite has provided explicit results for the initial dynamical data ( positions and momenta in adm coordinates ) of this problem .",
    "however , apart from stimulating further thoughts on the problem ( @xcite ) , we are not aware of the existence of numerical simulations implementing the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , nor are we aware of other numerical work leading to explicit ( non adiabatic ) waveforms for coalescing binaries which could be compared to the eob one .    data analysis groups associated with various ground - based interferometers are now finalizing the analysis software that will be used for gw searches in data that is expected to become available in a few years time .",
    "it is essential that these groups be aware of recent theoretical developments and of their respective merits so as to take the best advantage of the current knowledge in writing their software . with this view in mind",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold : first , we wish to compare the performances of the templates defined by the three different types of approaches mentioned above ( traditional `` non - resummed '' pn templates , `` resummed '' pn templates assuming the adiabatic approximation and stopping before the plunge , and further `` resummed '' pn templates going beyond the adiabatic approximation and incorporating the plunge with its transition from the inspiral . )",
    "second , in view of the fact that the original publications @xcite are quite complex and technical , we wish to summarize in a more accessible manner the key elements of the techniques introduced there ( and re - used , with further inputs , in @xcite . )",
    "the present work should serve as an easily accessible resource for data analysis groups .",
    "readers interested in a more detailed understanding of our general approach are referred to @xcite for motivation , formalism , logical reasoning , exhaustive tests and further discussion of the new signal models .",
    "in searching for gw from an inspiralling compact binary we are faced with the following data analysis problem : on the one hand , we have some ( unknown ) exact gravitational waveform @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the parameters of the signal ( e.g. , the masses @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the members of the emitting binary ) . on the other hand , we have theoretical calculations of the motion of @xcite , and gravitational radiation from @xcite binary systems consisting of neutron stars ( ns ) or black holes ( bh ) giving the pn expansions of an energy function @xmath41 which is related to the total relativistic energy @xmath42 via @xmath43 and a gw luminosity ( or `` flux '' ) function @xmath44 . here , the dimensionless argument @xmath45 is an invariantly defined `` velocity '' related to the instantaneous gw frequency @xmath46 ( @xmath47 twice the _ orbital _",

    ", one needs to compute the _",

    "[ it is sometimes convenient , though by no means necessary , to take as @xmath55 the velocity @xmath3 at the last stable orbit ( see below ) . ]",

    "the greater snr achieved by effective one - body waveforms for higher masses , as compared to fig 1 of dis2 , is due to the plunge phase present in these waveforms .",
    "we have checked that the final merger signal , modelled as a quasi - normal - mode , has a numerically insignificant effect in both the snr and the overlaps : the overlap between our fiducial exact waveform and an effective one - body waveform minus quasi - normal modes is greater than 0.98 for double black holes of masses smaller than @xmath288 .",
    "the origin of the enhancement in snr is easily understood .",
    "the plunge waveform begins around @xmath289 and lasts until @xmath290 @xcite .",
    "the mass of a binary whose last stable orbit velocity is equal to the characteristic velocity @xmath291 of ligo s peak sensitivity is @xmath292 .",
    "therefore , effective one - body waveforms from binaries of masses in the range @xmath293 have larger snrs for ligo , than the usual spa models .",
    "it is , therefore , crucial to go beyond the waveforms given in the adiabatic approximation to take advantage of these higher snrs for larger masses .",
    "indeed , the snrs being as high as 8 , for one detector and a source at @xmath294 mpc , a network of four detectors ( two ligos , geo and virgo ) will be able to reliably search for such systems as far as 150 - 200 mpc .",

    "the overlaps are computed with the ( initial ) ligo noise curve given in the appendix .",
    "in addition to maximization over the time lags and the phases as explained earlier , we also maximize over the masses of the approximate waveforms keeping the masses of the exact waveforms fixed .",
    "we note that none of the models have good overlaps with the `` exact '' one for heavier mass binaries .",
    "this is as expected since it is for heavier masses that the characteristic plunge phase makes a significant difference between the approximate and the exact models .",
    "the relative performances of the 2pn and 2.5pn taylor - templates depends on the choice of the scheme used as is evident from columns three and four in the table .",
    "this is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "( the numerical results must not be compared since they quote values for the `` advanced '' ligo . )",
    "some taylor models are `` effectual '' ( large maximized overlaps ) , but at the cost of high biases in the parameters ( i.e , in the terminology of @xcite they are not `` faithful '' ) .",
    "for example in the case of a fiducial exact ( 1.4,10 ) @xmath30 system @xmath303 reaches 0.9452 for mass values ( 0.8,20 ) @xmath30 ! thus",
    "t - approximants in the time - domain are significantly inferior to the other models , both for their erratic convergence properties ( the @xmath13-accurate templates being worse than the @xmath16-accurate ones ) and for their poor parameter estimation performance .    to further explore the performance of the various models we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdot ] their intrinsic frequency evolutions in the ligo band , i.e. we plot @xmath304 versus @xmath46 .",
    "the plot corresponds , in the fiducial exact case , to a binary black hole of ( 10,10 ) @xmath30 . for the approximate models we exhibit the frequency evolution of the system that achieves the maximum overlap .",
    "as expected , the maximum overlap is obtained for template parameters such that the intrinsic frequency evolution of the template waveform is `` tangent '' to the exact one , near the maximum sensitivity of the detector .",
    "this can always be achieved by fitting the mass parameters .",
    "the question is whether such a local `` tangency '' ensures a sufficiently good `` global '' agreement .",
    "for instance , we note that the @xmath305 2.5 pn models fare poorly in _ globally _ mimicking the frequency evolution of the exact waveform .",
    "this is consistent with their returning the worst overlaps of all .",
    "on the other hand , even though the @xmath285 models do not reproduce the exact model over as large a range as the @xmath94-approximants , they achieve nearly as large overlaps as the @xmath94-approximants , because they can be made ( by optimizing the masses ) to agree well with the exact model over most of the sensitive part of the ligo band .",
    "the @xmath94-approximants are able to mimic the `` exact '' evolution the best with little bias in the masses but , being based on the adiabatic approximation , they fail to capture the smooth transition to plunge - approximants return the best overlaps when truncated at the @xmath306defined lso . maximizing over a cutoff frequency smaller than the @xmath306defined @xmath307 ( which turns out to be higher than the effective - one - body - defined one ) does not improve the overlaps . ] .",
    "the filters using the effective one - body approach go beyond the adiabatic approximation and include a smooth transition to plunge and merger .",
    "they , therefore , supersede the adiabatic - limited p - approximants .",
    "this difference between the two re - summed versions of binary signal models is important for masses larger than about 20 @xmath34    note that , following @xcite , we have generated the effective - one - body model using the adimensional time @xmath308 .",
    "[ this trivially extends beyond the 2pn approximation @xcite . ]",
    "it has been recently emphasized @xcite ( in the context of the @xmath58- and @xmath94-approximants , where one can also simplify formulae by working with @xmath308 ) that there are many computational advantages in working with such adimensionalized time models .",
    "indeed , the phase evolution becomes completely independent of the total mass of the system .",
    "this , together with the fact that the evolution can be computed from a system of ode s , makes the computation and storage of templates required in a search for binary black holes and neutron stars in interferometer data computationally inexpensive as compared to the conventional method that uses a 2-dimensional lattice of templates .",
    "we are currently estimating the effects of unknown parameters in the 3pn motion and wave generation @xcite .",
    "the extension of the type of work presented here to go beyond the restricted post - newtonian approach , and also to include the effects due to spin and eccentricity , needs to be systematically investigated .    to conclude : we believe that many of the new technical tools developed in @xcite and briefly summarized above are useful ingredients for constructing effectual and fast - computed inspiral templates . for example",
    ": ( i ) the specific pad - based resummation of the gw flux introduced in @xcite is an important ingredient of the construction in @xcite of an accurate non - adiabatic waveform and , ( ii ) the improved spa technique derived in @xcite could be used to derive analytical approximations to the frequency - domain version of these effective - one - body waveforms . in view of our ignorance of the `` exact '' waveform emitted near and after the lso crossing ,",
    "the best strategy is probably to construct a bank of templates which cover a large range of possibilities with special weight being given to the templates incorporating the best tested re - summation methods ( such as p - approximants , and the effective - one - body - approach@xcite ) . because of the admittedly quantitatively rough , but plausibly qualitatively correct , description of the plunge signal given by the eob approach , we also recommend to include some sort of multi - parameter template which qualitatively looks like fig .",
    "12 of @xcite , but which introduces some flexibility both in the phasing evolution during the plunge , and in the location of the matching to the ring - down ( with the possible inclusion of several quasi - normal modes ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize the importance of modelling the transition to the plunge , and of including the signal emitted during the plunge : this leads to a very significant enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio , from about @xmath309 to @xmath310 , for a source at 100 mpc .",

    "<S> we compare the performances of the templates defined by three different types of approaches : traditional post - newtonian templates ( taylor - approximants ) , `` resummed '' post - newtonian templates assuming the adiabatic approximation and stopping before the plunge ( p - approximants ) , and further `` resummed '' post - newtonian templates going beyond the adiabatic approximation and incorporating the plunge with its transition from the inspiral ( effective - one - body approximants ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal to noise ratio is significantly enhanced ( mainly because of the inclusion of the plunge signal ) by using these new effective - one - body templates relative to the usual post - newtonian ones for a total binary mass @xmath0 , and reaches a maximum around @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> independently of the question of the plunge signal , the comparison of the various templates confirms the usefulness of using resummation methods . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also summarizes the key elements of the construction of various templates and thus can serve as a resource for those involved in writing inspiral search software . </S>"
