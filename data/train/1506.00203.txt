    "two dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) show a great deal of fascinating transport phenomena due to the mixing of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom , providing the possibility of realizing all - electrical and all - thermal spin control in semiconductor structures .",
    "these are the main topics of the rapid developing research fields of spintronics@xcite and spin - caloritronics@xcite . in the electrical spin control ,",
    "the generation of a spin current and a nonequilibrium spin polarization transverse to an applied electric field without external magnetic field are remarkable , known as the spin hall effect@xcite and electric - field induced spin polarization@xcite , respectively .",
    "their thermal counterparts toward all - thermal spin control , i.e. , the spin nernst effect@xcite and temperature - gradient induced spin polarization@xcite , have also attracted more and more interests recently .",
    "the 2d electron system ( 2des ) with rashba soc has been one of the most widely used models to investigate aforementioned effects@xcite . in the 2d rashba model , two bands cross at zero energy , one of them is always positive and the other one possesses a band valley regime below the band crossing point as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this valley regime",
    "the dispersion curve is not monotonic in momentum space .",
    "this regime possesses nontrivial topology of the constant energy surfaces ( or fermi surfaces)@xcite , which leads to some exciting theoretical predictions , e.g. , the enhanced superconducting critical temperature@xcite , the non - dyakonov - perel spin relaxation behavior@xcite and the significantly enhanced room - temperature thermoelectric figure of merit@xcite .",
    "there have been a few theoretical studies @xcite on the transport properties when the fermi energy is in or near the band valley regime . however , in rashba systems formed in conventional narrow - gap semiconductor heterostructures@xcite , the rashba spin splitting energy is so small that the band valley structure can not survive the weak disorder broadening and thermal smearing even at very low temperatures . in these systems",
    "the fermi energy usually lies quite above the band crossing point , therefore the band valley is irrelevant to transport .",
    "recently experimental progress has been made by the discovery of giant bulk and surface rashba soc effects in v - vi - vii polar semiconductors bitex , ( x = cl , br , i)@xcite . in these noncentrosymmetric semiconductors , first - principles calculations and arpes measurements",
    "have clearly demonstrated the existence of 2des confined near the surface with giant rashba energy as large as about @xmath1@xcite . in such 2des ,",
    "the investigation of electrical and thermal spin control is of significance due to the giant soc which is promising for spintronics and spin - caloritronics applications . while , when the electron - impurity scattering dominates , for the case that fermi energies lie below or in the vicinity of the band crossing point , the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) used in previous theoretical works on the nonequilibrium spin polarization@xcite may not work well due to the giant rashba soc",
    "this motivates us to systematically investigate the thermoelectric response of spin polarization in 2des with giant rashba soc , focusing on the consequences of different fermi surface topologies between the two sides of the band crossing point .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the semiclassical boltzmann equation to calculate the spin polarization induced by electric field and temperature gradient .",
    "we focus on the 2d rashba model at low temperatures where the static impurity scattering dominates .",
    "our calculation is based on an exact transport time solution of the boltzmann equation in the born approximation , different from the widely used modified rta and constant rta schemes@xcite .",
    "we show that the electric - field induced spin polarization ( eisp ) as a function of the fermi energy @xmath0 behaves differently between the two sides of the band crossing point @xmath2 .",
    "a linear dependence of eisp on @xmath0 is obtained for @xmath3 , differing from the edelstein result@xcite for @xmath4 . the spin polarization efficiency , defined as the ratio between the eisp and the driven electric - current , increases for lower @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature - gradient induced spin polarization ( tisp ) is calculated , and its dependence on the fermi energy , changing from large positive values to be quite below the band crossing point , is continuous and monotonic .",
    "it is also shown that the temperature - gradient induced spin polarization tends to zero at vanishing temperatures .",
    "we study the 2d rashba model with spin independent disorder@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the disorder potential produced by randomly distributed @xmath7-scatters at @xmath8 and is assumed to be standard white - noise disorder : @xmath9 . here",
