    "the rate of cell division in a bacterial colony can vary over time , with the increase of growth - induced local pressure @xcite .",
    "however , such an effect is minimal during the initial stages of colony growth studied here , and hence neglected in our simulations .",
    "all our simulations , start from a single randomly orientated cell , which is then free to grow in length and duplicate .",

    "[ fig:1 ] shows the typical configurations observed at the early stages of colonization both _ in vitro _ and _ in silico_. the emergence of local nematic order is conspicuous throughout the system , however this does not propagate across the colony , but remains confined into a set of microscopic domains .",
    "these nematic domains , or `` patches '' , are separated from each other by fracture lines reminiscent of grain boundaries in crystals @xcite .",
    "as the colony evolves , the domains grow , merge , buckle , and break apart , in a complex sequence of morphological and topological transformations .",
    "[ fig : mdsnapshots ] shows three examples of proliferating colonies of cells each with different division length @xmath4 , and hence , different aspect ratios . the typical domain area , as we can see , depends on the length of the cell at division .",
    "overall , the micro - domains have no preferential orientation ( insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdsnapshots ] ) , and the colony is globally isotropic and characterized by the circular shape .",
    "the absence of the global orientational order can be ascribed to the inherent instability of the domains , that continuously buckle and fracture under the effect of growth - induced stress .",
    "the typical domain area then represents not only the coherent length scale of orientational order , but also the length scale at which the colony internal stresses compromise .",
    "to quantify the geometry of the bacterial colonies , we have introduced the following domain segmentation criterion : two cells belong to the same domain if they are in contact , and that their relative orientation differs by less than @xmath23 . as this definition depends on the choice of a threshold",
    ", so will the distribution of domain area . nonetheless , the structure of the distribution and the general trends identified in the various observables , are generally robust and independent of the chosen threshold . a central quantity to characterize the geometry of a colony , is the probability density of the domain area , @xmath24 .",

    "the frequency of domains with area @xmath25 decreases with @xmath25 , and for sufficiently large @xmath25 values , @xmath24 approaches the exponential distribution : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a characteristic area scale proportional depending on the division length @xmath28 and proportional to the typical area of the micro - domains .    .",
    "in order to quantify the spatial dependence of the domain areas , we have calculated the average domain area restricted to an annular strip located at distance @xmath29 from the center of the colony , denoted @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdresults]a , inset ) .",
    "the local domain area is uniform in the bulk of the colony , for a given aspect ratio of the cells , before dropping to zero at the boundary , where the colony is more disordered . in turn , the average domain area in the bulk @xmath31 , is strongly affected by the division length @xmath4 .",
    "this is visibly conspicuous in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdsnapshots ] .",
    "increasing @xmath4 causes the cells to be , on average , more slender , resulting in larger and more stable domains , as revealed by the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdresults]b . more interestingly , increasing the growth rate @xmath20 has the opposite effect , and causes a drop in the domain area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdresults]c ) .",
    "the results demonstrate that the emergent geometrical attributes of the micro - domains in a growing bacterial colony are regulated by the competing effects of cell length and the division rate .",
    "these effects can ultimately be ascribed to the mechanical properties of the system , as we will explain in the next subsection .",
    "the domain geometry in a proliferating bacterial colony is determined by the interplay between two competing forces : steric repulsion between neighboring cells and the extensile stresses due to cell growth . while cell - cell steric repulsion favors alignment , the emergent extensile stresses due to the growth within a restricted environment ( i.e. , the space delimited by the neighboring domains ) , tend to deform , and eventually fracture a domain .",
    "both these effects are due to contact forces and are , therefore , enhanced by the local packing fraction , @xmath32 . to clarify this concept ,",
    "we have measured the local packing fraction @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the area of the @xmath12th cell , located at time @xmath35 inside a thin annulus of radius @xmath29 and area @xmath36 , centered at the colony center .",
    "as we have found , the colony has a radial symmetry , hence the local packing fraction depends exclusively on the distance @xmath29 from the center .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]a shows that at any given time the packing fraction decreases monotonically with @xmath29 . as bacteria duplicate and progressively colonize the surrounding space , the local packing fraction increases throughout the system while maintaining a characteristic spatial profile that smoothly interpolates between a time - dependent maximum @xmath37 , at the center of the colony , and the time - independent minimum , @xmath38 , at the edge ( @xmath39 being the colony radius ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 is the critical packing fraction at which the cells first start to compress each other . in close proximity of the edge of the colony ,",
    "@xmath41 and the contact forces tend to reorient the cells without compressing them , leading to an abrupt drop in packing fraction . upon rescaling density by @xmath42 and distance @xmath29 by the colony radius @xmath39",
    ", the density spatial dependence can be described , at any time , by a a simple quadratic law : @xmath43 as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]a . as we will analytically prove in sec .",
    "[ sec : continuum ] , such a density profile originates from balance between growth - induced pressure and drag .",
    "the tendency of the cells to align with each other is driven by the local steric interactions , and can be conceptualized in the framework of frank elasticity @xcite , starting from the free - energy density : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is an orientational stiffness penalizing , in equal amount , splay and bending deformations and @xmath46 is the nematic director corresponding to the average orientation of the bacteria .",
    "any departure from the uniformly aligned configuration causes restoring forces proportional to the field @xmath47 @xcite . as a consequence of growth",
    ", each cell further acts as an extensile force dipole that pushes away its neighbors along the @xmath48 direction .",
    "this collectively gives rise to an internal stress of the form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the pressure , @xmath51 the identity matrix and @xmath52 the deviatoric active stress @xcite .",
    "in the most general case , the three quantities @xmath45 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 , appearing in eqs . and , are functions of the local packing fraction , and the nematic order parameter , in addition to the cell aspect ratio and the growth rate .    eqs . and",
    "identify a fundamental length scale @xmath53 , proportional to the length at which the orientational elastic stress balances the extensile active stress @xcite .",
    "this length scale plays a pivotal role in the mechanics of active fluids , and , depending on how it compares with the system size @xmath54 , it determines the system mechanical behavior .",
    "active nematics liquid crystals , in particular , relax toward the minimum of the frank free energy when @xmath55 , as the restoring forces arising in response to the elastic distortions outweigh the active forces .",
    "as @xmath56 , the nematic ground state becomes unstable to a state characterized by a spontaneous distortion and laminar flow @xcite .",
    "such a steady state becomes unstable to an oscillatory state when @xmath57 @xcite , while for @xmath58 , the dynamics are completely chaotic @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on motile _ b. subtilis _ under confinement @xcite , have confirmed this fascinating scenario and opened the way to understanding the effect of environmental stimuli in active materials .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate that in a growing colony of non - motile cells , the inherent length scale @xmath59 determines the geometrical properties of the micro - domains in such a way that @xmath60 . for this purpose",
    ", we have measured the orientational stiffness @xmath45 and the stresses @xmath61 exerted inside the colony .",
    "the latter can be calculated from the virial expansion @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the effective area occupied by the @xmath12th cell .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]b shows a plot of the various components of the stress tensor versus packing fraction , given by eq . .",
    "the tensor is expressed in the basis of the nematic director and its normal @xmath64 , namely : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the commutator .",
    "as expected the normal stresses @xmath67 and @xmath68 increases with packing fraction and , at any finite packing fraction , are such that @xmath69 , as a consequence of the anisotropic cell growth . the shear - stress @xmath70 , on the other hand , is always negligible because of the absence of lateral friction between the cells .",
    "note that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are negative because of the extensile nature of the growth - induced forces .",
    "the dependence of the normal stresses on packing fraction is piecewise linear : for @xmath71 , the contact forces can be relieved by rotations and repositioning of the cells and @xmath72 ; while for @xmath73 , the cells in the bulk are tightly packed and internal stresses build up as the packing fraction increases . setting @xmath74 in eq . and",
    "taking @xmath75 , one can rearrange the stress tensor in the form : @xmath76 comparing this with eq . , straightforwardly yields @xmath77 and @xmath78 . together with the numerical results summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmake ] , this implies : @xmath79 as long as @xmath73 .",
    "not unexpectedly , the longitudinal growth of the cells gives rise to an extensile ( i.e. @xmath80 ) active stress that decreases monotonically with the distance from the center of the colony .",

    "it follows that @xmath93 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]e , the orientational stiffness @xmath45 increases linearly with packing fraction , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , increasing the the slenderness of the cells , makes the colony orientationally stiffer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]e ) .    combining the measurements of the extensile active stress and the orientational stiffness , we are finally able to formulate a scaling law for the area of the nematic micro - domains comprising our simulated bacterial colonies .",
    "namely : @xmath95 in agreement with our numerical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmake]f ) . in summary ,",
    "bacterial colonies freely growing on a two - dimensional frictional substrate spontaneously organize into a `` mosaic '' of micro - domains consisting of highly aligned cells .",
    "the domains are randomly oriented so that the colony is globally isotropic and circularly symmetric at the global scale , while their areas are exponentially distributed , as indicated in eq . .",
    "such a distribution results from the competition between passive steric forces , that favor local alignment , and the extensile active forces originating from the cell growth .",
    "these forces balance at the length @xmath96 , resulting in a characteristic domain area that scales as @xmath97 .",
    "remarkably , both the orientational stiffness @xmath45 and the extensile active stress @xmath52 scale linearly with the packing fraction @xmath32 . consequently @xmath98 , so that and the average domain area is uniform throughout the colony ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdresults ] inset ) .",
    "such a peculiar cancellation of the density dependence is presumably specific of the type of interactions chosen here and we do not expect it to hold in general .",
    "including the bending elasticity of the cells could , for instance , change the density dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath52 , resulting in a space - dependent active length scale . yet , the mechanism described here and summarized by eq .",
    "is general and does not depend on the details of the model .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that much of the behavior previously described can be quantitatively captured in the realm of continuum mechanics , by means of a suitable extension to the hydrodynamic equations of active nematic liquid crystals .",
    "these have been successfully used in the past decade to describe a variety of active fluids , typically of biological origin , consisting of self or mutually propelled apolar building blocks , such as in vitro suspensions of microtubules and kinesin @xcite , micro - swimmers @xcite and cellular monolayers @xcite .",
    "attempts to describe sessile bacteria , in the language of nematic liquid crystals , have been recently made @xcite . here",

    "<S> bacterial colonies are abundant on living and non - living surfaces and are known to mediate a broad range of processes in ecology , medicine and industry . </S>",
    "<S> although extensively researched , from single cells to demographic scales , a comprehensive biomechanical picture , highlighting the cell - to - colony dynamics , is still lacking . here , using molecular dynamics simulations and continuous modelling , we investigate the geometrical and mechanical properties of a bacterial colony growing on a substrate with free boundary , and demonstrate that such an expanding colony self - organizes into a `` mosaic '' of micro - domains consisting of highly aligned cells . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of micro - domains is mediated by two competing forces : the steric forces between neighboring cells which favour cell alignment , and the extensile stresses due to cell growth that tend to reduce the local orientational order , and thereby distort the system . </S>",
    "<S> this interplay results into an exponential distribution of the domain areas , and sets a characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile active stress . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our examination of the internal stresses reveal that , in addition to biochemical pathways , the spatiotemporal organization in microbial colonies is significantly affected by the mechanical forces exerted and experienced by the growing cells .    </S>",
    "<S> bacteria successfully colonize a plethora of surfaces by producing hydrated extracellular polymeric matrix , generally composed of proteins , exopolysaccharides and extracellular dna @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such surface - associated communities play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many chronic infections : from benign dental caries in the oral cavity @xcite to life - threatening cystic fibrosis and catheter - related endocarditis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to their planktonic counterpart , comprising freely moving cells ( by virtue of swimming , gliding , or swarming motion ) , cells in a sessile colony lack motility . </S>",
    "<S> since most bacteria found in nature exist predominantly as surface - associated colonies @xcite , they are permanently exposed to a range of surface - specific forces @xcite : time - varying internal stress due to growth , contact forces due to interactions with the neighboring cells and substrate they are growing on , or shear stresses due to ambient flows in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of the mechanics of bacterial growth is still at its infancy , specifically in light of the wide range of mechanical cues that single cells overcome to successfully colonize surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> although it has been long known that mechanical forces play a critical role in the development and fitness of eukaryotic cells , and , in addition , can regulate key molecular pathways @xcite , the cornerstone of major discoveries in bacterial communities have relied on biochemical pathways triggered exclusively by chemical stimuli @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is only recently that the role of mechanics in the ecophysiology of prokaryotic cells is coming to the forefront @xcite , highlighting the governing biophysical principles that drive colony formation .    </S>",

    "<S> ( a)-(c ) phase contrast micrographs at different time points capture the growth of a single cell of non - motile strain of _ escherichia coli _ to a two - dimensional colony under free boundary conditions ( the cell doubling time is @xmath032 minutes , and the scale bar corresponds to 2 @xmath1 m ) . depending upon the physiological state , </S>",
    "<S> the aspect ratio of the cells ( length / width ) varied between 3.1 and 4.5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d)-(f ) the corresponding three time points during the growth of a bacterial colony obtained using molecular dynamics simulations ( sec . [ sec : md ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rods are colour coded by their orientation as described in the colour wheel ( panel f , upper right corner ) . ]    here we investigate the spatial organization and the stress distribution of a colony of non - motile , rod shaped bacteria growing on a substrate with free boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> although non - motile bacteria interact mostly through steric forces , pushing each other out of the way as they grow in length , the combination of these passive forces with the the bacteria active growth results into a complex internal dynamics as well the formation of coherent structures ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]a - c ) reminiscent of those observed in active liquid crystals @xcite . using molecular dynamics simulations and continuous modeling , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an expanding colony self - organizes into a `` mosaic '' of nematic micro - domains , whose typical size is set by the competition between growth - induced active forces , that tend to disorder the system , and passive steric forces , that tend to reorganize the bacteria into close packed nematic structures . </S>",
    "<S> this competition results into an exponential distribution of the domain areas , with a characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile active stress . </S>",
    "<S> both active and passive forces scale linearly with the cell density . therefore , despite the colony being denser in the center than at the periphery , such an inherent length scale remains uniform throughout the system .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : md ] , we introduce a hard - rod model for growing bacteria and we describe the geometrical ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : geometry ] ) and mechanical ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : mechanics ] ) properties of the emergent micro - domains . </S>",
    "<S> building on these results , in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : continuum ] we construct a continuum theory for growing bacterial colonies grounded on the hydrodynamics of active nematic liquid crystals . finally , in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and modelling approach in the context of previously reported experiments , and draw conclusions emphasising the role of geometry and mechanics during the early stages of biofilm formation . </S>"
