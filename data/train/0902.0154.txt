    "we consider the following functional @xmath28 the study of which arises from a number of sources , one of the earliest and most important is the article by aviles , giga @xcite .",

    "functional @xmath24 is usually minimised over the space of functions @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 on @xmath34 ( in the sense of trace ) where @xmath6 is the inward pointing unit normal , we will denote this space of functions by @xmath1 .",
    "aviles , giga raised the problem of the study of the limiting behavior of @xmath24 as @xmath35 in connection with the theory of smectic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "in @xcite gioia , ortiz studied @xmath24 as a model for thin film blisters .",
    "jin , kohn @xcite introduced the by now classic method of estimating the energy by ` divergence of vectorfields ' .",
    "a related functional arising from micromagnetics was studied by riviere , serfaty @xcite , in this case the functional acts on vector fields @xmath36 ( in two dimensions ) satisfying @xmath37 in @xmath0 and the functional is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is vectorfield @xmath36 extended trivially by @xmath40 outside @xmath0 . for the aviles",
    "giga functional we minimise over curl free vector fields and the functional forces the norm of the vector field to be @xmath41 with weighting @xmath42 while constraining an @xmath43 multiple of the @xmath44 norm ( squared ) of the gradient , on the other hand the micromagnetics functional is minimised over vectorfields whose norm is taken to be @xmath41 from the outset and the functional forces the vector field to be divergence free with weighting @xmath42 is the @xmath44 norm of the hodge projection onto curl free vector fields ] while again constraining an @xmath43 multiple of the @xmath44 norm ( squared ) of the gradient .",
    "functional @xmath45 is much more rigid and very much stronger results are known for it than for @xmath24 , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .    roughly speaking",
    ", the conjecture is that as @xmath35 the energy of minimisers of @xmath24 will converge to a collection of curves on which the gradient of the minimisers make a jump of order @xmath46 perpendicularly across the curve .",
    "this has already been proved for functional @xmath45 @xcite . a way to think about",
    "this is the following , given a connected lipschitz domain @xmath0 let @xmath47 be the distance from @xmath4 and let @xmath48 be @xmath47 convolved by a convolution kernel of diameter @xmath43 , the regions where @xmath49 will be exactly the @xmath43 neighborhoods of the curves on which @xmath50 has a jump discontinuity . if @xmath0 is a ball @xmath50 will have a discontinuity only at one point , in all other cases there will be non trivial curves of singularities and for the specific function @xmath48 , it is exactly in an @xmath43 neighborhood of these curves that the energy will concentrate .",
    "the conjecture is that what we can observe directly for @xmath48 will hold true for the minimisers of @xmath24 .    the most natural way to study these questions is within the frame work of @xmath51 convergence .",
    "one of the earliest successes of @xmath51 convergence was the characterisation of the @xmath51 limit of the so called modica mortola functional @xmath52 which is minimised over scalar functions @xmath47 satisfying an integral condition of the form @xmath53 .",
    "it was shown by modica , mortola @xcite ( confirming a conjecture of degiorgi ) that the @xmath51 limit of @xmath54 is a constant multiple of the @xmath55 measure of the jump set @xmath56 minimised over the space of functions @xmath57 . given the elementary inequality @xmath58 we have that for any sequence @xmath59 of equibounded @xmath60 energy ( for some subsequence @xmath11 ) has a uniform @xmath61 control of @xmath62 and the measure we obtain as the limit of this @xmath61 sequence of gradients will naturally be supported on the jump set of the limiting function . in some sense the nature of the @xmath51 limit of @xmath54 could be anticipated from ( [ eqd1 ] ) .    functional @xmath24 is the most natural higher order generalisation of @xmath54 , in the case of @xmath24 the conjectured @xmath51 limit is surprising , this is part of the reason that functional @xmath24 has received so much attention .",
    "the first works on identifying the @xmath51 limit are by aviles , giga @xcite and jin , kohn @xcite , later these ideas were developed by ambrosio , delellis , mantegazza @xcite , roughly speaking the limiting function space is conjectured to have a structure similar to the space of functions whose gradient is @xmath63 and the limiting energy is conjectured to have the form @xmath64 .",
    "much progress has been made on this conjecture , particularly equi - coercivity of @xmath24 has been shown independently in @xcite and in the work of desimone , kohn , muller , otto @xcite . a proposed limiting function space @xmath65 and limiting functional @xmath66 as been suggested in @xcite and it was shown that all limits of sequences of functions @xmath12 with @xmath67 are such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the compactness proofs provided by @xcite and",

    "the authors ( building on work of jin kohn @xcite ) found two third order polynomials @xmath73 and @xmath74 such that @xmath75 using some elementary and surprising identities satisfied by @xmath76 a different approach to compactness was found . rather naturally considering ( [ eqd20 ] ) , the function space @xmath65 proposed by @xcite is given by the set of functions @xmath23 for which @xmath77 forms a radon measure for @xmath78 and the limiting energy functional @xmath79",

    "this leads to some regularity ; @xmath88 for all @xmath89 , @xmath90 and using the kinetic equation a different proof of compactness was found .",

    "perthame @xcite were able to characterise zero energy limits ( and the domains that allow them ) for @xmath24 , in fact their result is stronger , they showed that if a divergence free vector field @xmath36 satisfies the kinetic equation @xmath95 , @xmath96 a.e .  in @xmath0 and @xmath97 on @xmath4",

    "note that for the function @xmath45 the minimiser of the limiting energy is known to be rectifiable @xcite , for a sequence with only equibounded energy the measure is not known to be singular .",

    "the many strong results about measure @xmath124 ( and the measure that gives the limiting functional for the micromagnetics function ) have been achieved by characterising various kinds of _ blow up of the measure and understanding well the absolute ( i.e.  non quantitative ) situation in the limit @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in some sense",
    "there are only two possibilities , to take a limit and have an absolute situation and to understand the measure from this , or to stop before the limit and have a non - absolute situation and try and understand something about it with a quantitative theorem .",
    "our primary motivation in proving a quantitative version of jabin - otto - perthame theorem was so as to obtain a result that could be used for the latter approach .",

    "while the proof for convex domains is slightly involved , there are only a couple of ideas that are really central",
    ". we will sketch the proof for the case @xmath125 , ignoring ( without comment ) many technicalities in order to give an impression of the basic skeleton .    the real engine of the proof is the characterisation in @xcite of the set of @xmath70 such that ( [ eqd1.6 ] ) is satisfied . as mentioned in the introduction , as consequence of the characterisation it was shown there",
    "exists a sequence of @xmath93 satisfying ( [ eqd1.6 ] ) that converge pointwise to the function @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath40 otherwise .",
