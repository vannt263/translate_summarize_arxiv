    "neutrino oscillation serves as one of the most cultivating fields in the discipline of elementary particle physics .",
    "research along these lines have been boosted after various new experiments on solar and reactor neutrinos started yielding tantalizing results @xcite . despite of its direct connection to the elementary particle physics neutrino oscillation",
    "has important contributions to cosmology and astrophysics as well .",
    "even though the neutrino oscillation was put to firm experimental grounds only recently , the theoretical prediction comes much earlier from the work of pontecorvo @xcite and then subsequently it was generalized for propagation within varying density medium in @xcite .",
    "the oscillation we have discussed so far corresponds to neutrino flavour oscillation .",
    "there is another oscillation between various helicity states within a single flavour , known as neutrino spin oscillation .",
    "we could also have a mixture of both flavour and spin oscillations , which corresponds to neutrino spin - flavour oscillation .",
    "one of the key research area in neutrino oscillation is the determination of neutrino mass and their mixing angles .",
    "this focuses on the important fact that even though the mass squared difference between various neutrino flavours and their mixing angles are well known , there is ambiguity in the determination of absolute values of neutrino masses .",
    "this leads to the famous paradigm that neutrino masses are either hierarchical or quasi - degenerate in their very nature .",
    "these results lend themselves to various important questions , which have been key research topics in recent years .",
    "these include : non - zero value for the mixing angle @xmath0 , possible aspects of cp violation in neutrino oscillation and importantly the non - vanishing @xmath1 mixing angle . a large number of theoretical models exist to explain the above results .",
    "these theoretical models include , neutrino mass considered to be degenerate by some sea - saw mechanism , assumption of large mixing angle for solar as well as for atmospheric neutrino and use of renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "another important place to look for effects of neutrino oscillation is astrophysics .",
    "the effects being numerous .",
    "since neutrinos are sterile to most of the interactions , after creation they come out unimpeded and contain important information about the source .",
    "this is the main reason for setting detectors like icecube in order to detect ultra - high energy neutrino from galactic centers and active galactic nuclei .",
    "there are also other signatures of neutrino oscillation like in the pulsar kick mechanism devised from spin - flavour oscillation of neutrino .",
    "the behavior of neutrino in high magnetic field existing surrounding a pulsar can lead to resonant oscillation and _ neutrinosphere_. these _ neutrinospheres _ can explain high proper motion of the pulsar with respect to the neighbouring stars @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation was first formulated in flat spacetime which was subsequently generalized to curved spacetime @xcite and the formalism can also be used to test the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "it was well known that for black hole solutions of the oscillation phase along timelike geodesic yields a factor of 2 in comparison to null geodesics .",
    "the reason behind being the fact that even though the neutrino moves along null geodesic i.e. @xmath2 , the neutrino being massive satisfies the relation , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy of factor 2 between oscillation phase along null and timelike geodesic persists for a spherically symmetric metric with @xmath4 @xcite and has been reproduced here for the most general of such situations .    along with neutrino flavour oscillation",
    ", the spin oscillation of neutrino is another important aspect . in gravitational field",
    "the spin of a particle precess and thus there is a non - zero probability of neutrino spin flip .",
    "there are two possible ways in which the spin oscillation can be studied .",
    "the first one corresponds to starting with dirac hamiltonian in gravitational field and then obtaining mixing terms among various chirality and thus establishing spin oscillation @xcite .",
    "the other option is to work with dynamics of spinning particle in gravitational field following @xcite .",
    "the spin oscillation probability for circular motion of neutrino in schwarzschild spacetime has been derived in @xcite and the generalization to rotating black holes in general relativity has been done in @xcite .",
    "however all the above studies of neutrino spin and flavour oscillations have been performed in general relativity ( except in @xcite ) .",
    "then it is important to understand how these ideas reconcile with alternative theories of gravity since there is a general belief that is only a low energy approximation of an underlying fundamental theory @xcite . in this spirit",
    "the action for gets modified by addition of higher derivative and higher order curvature terms . there",
    "exist large number of ways in which these higher order terms can be introduced in the standard action .",
    "however the criteria that field equations should remain second order in the dynamical variable ( otherwise some ghost fields would appear ) uniquely fixes the action to be the lanczos - lovelock action @xcite .",
    "another such model explaining the above mentioned problems is obtained by replacing @xmath5 , the scalar curvature in the action by some arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath6 . this alternative theory for describing gravitational interaction is very interesting in its on spite , for it can provide an explanation to various problems in existing general relativity as well as it confronts equally well with various tests of general relativity @xcite .",
    "in this context we should also mention dilaton couplings in string inspired models , where non - zero electromagnetic fields gets coupled to dilaton @xcite and results in substantial modifications to solution in general relativity .",
    "also we can modify the gravity theory by introducing quadratic curvatures of various forms .",
    "this has been discussed along with possible modifications of the schwarzschild solution in @xcite .",
    "there also exist black hole solutions , which are regular and physical singularity is non- existent .",
    "these solutions involve modified gravity , properly dressed additional fields , such that energy conditions leading to physical singularity are violated @xcite .",
    "the first such regular black hole solution was obtained by bardeen with magnetic charge and its relation to non - linear electrodynamics was shown by ayn - beato and garca @xcite ( henceforth referred to as abg ) .",
    "however the solution was _ non - exact_. the _ exact _ solution to einstein s equation with non linear electrodynamics was obtained by ayn - beato and garca later in @xcite .",
    "we have applied the formalism devised by us for the most general static spherically symmetric spacetime to these three black hole solutions described earlier and have studied the effect of these alternative theories to the neutrino flavour oscillation .    for neutrino spin oscillation",
    "we have considered two more alternative gravity theories both having interesting theoretical properties .",
    "the first one corresponds to vacuum solution in @xmath6 gravity .",
    "as we have already mentioned @xmath6 gravity is a very interesting alternative theory as it can explain all the three cosmological phases ( for an alternative model see @xcite ) , it passes through various local tests for general relativity @xcite , moreover it can explain absence of graviton kaluza klein modes in lhc @xcite . motivated by these successes we consider vacuum solution in @xmath6 gravity which corresponds to the schwarzschild ( anti ) de - sitter solution . secondly , we consider the second order term with additional maxwell field in addition to the lagrangian .",
    "this is known as the einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb ) gravity .",
    "this alternative theory as well posses static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "we have considered the spin oscillation probability in these two alternative theories and imposed bounds on the parameters .",
    "it turns out that these bounds are consistent with previous results .",
    "in brief , in this work we have generalized previous works on neutrino spin and flavour oscillation to most general static spherically symmetric spacetime . to our surprise even in this general context we can make interesting predictions like , _ for a neutrino on a circular orbit in high energy limit the oscillation frequency vanishes_. hence a high energy neutrino will not have any spin flip as long as it is on a circular orbit . we have also derived the oscillation frequency for geodesic motion and have used it to compute the probability of helicity flip . on the other hand",
    "we have also derived oscillation phase and oscillation length for neutrino flavour oscillation which has been used to constrain the alternative theories . in this context",
    "we have an interesting result that oscillation length depends only on the @xmath7 component .",
    "it does not depend on any other metric components except for conserved energy and angular momentum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with a broad introduction to the spin oscillation in presence of gravitational field in and then to spin oscillation frequency in . after that we consider general formulation for neutrino flavour oscillation and the application to alternative theories in .",
    "finally , we provide our analysis for neutrino helicity flip in with concluding remarks in .",
    "the detailed calculations are being provided in the two appendices , appendix [ neu : appa ] , which contain all relevant calculations for both spin and flavour oscillation and in appendix [ neu : appb ] , where we have illustrated the circular orbit related issues for our general static , spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "spin angular momentum of a body gets affected by the curvature of spacetime , for example , a gyroscope orbiting around a massive body will undergo a precession of its spin .",
    "motion of a spinning particle in gravitational field is discussed with great detail in ref .",
    "spin of a spinning particle can be presented by the use of the spin tensor @xmath8 and it s momentum @xmath9 such that we can introduce the spin vector @xmath10 where , we have introduced the completely antisymmetric tensor density @xmath11 , the determinant of the metric @xmath12 and the on - mass shell condition , @xmath13 . for point particles , using principle of general covariance it can be shown that the evolution of spin vector @xmath14 and four - velocity @xmath15 are parallel transported along its world - line . also the fact that spin and velocity four - vectors are orthogonal to each other remains true even in curved spacetime i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "however , the properties of the particle are determined by the spin vector in it s rest frame . in order to use this property",
    "we should write the geodesic equation in a locally inertial frame . this can be done with the help of vierbein vectors @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the minkowski index .",
    "thus we have the following properties of the vierbein vector @xmath19 where we have the following relation : @xmath20 for the inverse vierbein and @xmath21 is the metric tensor in the local minkowski frame .",
    "thus with the use of vierbein vectors the components of spin and four - velocity in a local inertial frame takes the following form , along with the evolution equation @xmath22 where , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is like the electromagnetic field tensor and the object , @xmath25 represents the ricci rotation coefficients . in order to make the spin evolution in the particle s rest frame , we should apply boost within a locally inertial frame . for",
    "that we can introduce two four - vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 constructed from @xmath28 such that , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then both  electric \" field @xmath31 and  magnetic \" field @xmath32 has only spatial components denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these two vectors will govern the spin evolution in the rest frame of the particle , which is a linear equation in the spin vector .",
    "this spin evolution is similar in spirit to the evolution of a charged particle interacting with external electromagnetic field .",
    "now we can consider three - dimensional spin vector in the rest frame of the particle given by @xmath37 .",
    "evolution of this three dimensional vector is determined by the following equation : @xmath38 where the vector @xmath39 is constructed out of two three - vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 as : @xmath40 then the neutrino spin precession is being determined by the vector @xmath41 and is intimately connected to the spin oscillation frequency of the neutrino .",
    "hence the main framework to determine the spin precession vector @xmath42 goes as follows : ( a ) given a spacetime , we need to evaluate the vierbein vectors and the four velocity of the neutrino traveling in this spacetime , ( b ) then we need to calculate the covariant derivative in order to determine the tensor @xmath28 , ( c ) starting from the tensor @xmath28 calculate the ",
    "electric \" and  magnetic \" field and finally ( d ) evaluate the three - vector @xmath39 in the vierbein frame to get the oscillation frequency .",
    "the above calculation has been performed in appendix [ neu : appa : a ] and we will apply these results in the next section to obtain spin oscillation frequency for the most general static spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "the basic equations governing the spin of a particle in a gravitational field has been discussed in . in this section , we will apply those equations to determine the spin evolution and oscillation of neutrino in a spherically symmetric , static spacetime .",
    "this will enable us to determine properties connected to neutrino spin as it propagates around a black hole or a massive object .",
    "this question was addressed in the context of general relativity , however in this work we will try to observe the effect of additional correction terms to the action on the spin oscillation of neutrino and possible shift of oscillation frequency . in this section",
    "we will outline the basic equations necessary for determination of spin oscillation and then shall concentrate on neutrino flavour oscillation in various alternative theories of gravity before again returning to neutrino spin oscillation .    with possible applications in mind the static spherically",
    "symmetric metric ansatz has been chosen in the form : @xmath43 the horizons in the spacetime are determined by the two conditions : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "except for some simple configuration where @xmath46 , the two conditions in general do not match .",
    "if we choose our coordinates such that , one of them , namely @xmath47 , remains constant on the horizon , then the normal , @xmath48 , has norm @xmath49 . thus the condition @xmath45 identifies the horizon as a null surface .",
    "similarly the condition @xmath44 , identifies the respective surface as a surface of infinite redshift and is known as the ergo surface . for spacetime admitting killing vector @xmath50 , for time translation symmetry , the norm of the killing vector @xmath51 implies that @xmath44 determines the killing horizon .",
    "hence both these surfaces have physical significance .",
    "the oscillation frequency can be obtained in the following steps : first , we need to determine the 4-velocity of the neutrino , in terms of the conserved energy and angular momentum and the vierbein vectors .",
    "then the covariant derivatives of the vierbein vectors are related directly to the  electric \" and  magnetic \" fields .",
    "thus by evaluating the covariant derivatives we have obtained the components of  electric \" and  magnetic \" fields . then we can construct the vector @xmath52 and thus the spin precession angular velocity vector @xmath53 .",
    "as we are in a spacetime which is spherically symmetric , we can exploit this symmetry to confine our discussion to the equatorial i.e. @xmath54 plane .",
    "there only a single component of spin precession survives .",
    "this component has distinct expression in different situations .",
    "below we discuss possible situations with respective expressions for the spin precession @xmath55 [ for detailed calculation see appendix [ neu : appa ] ] :    * we start our analysis with a situation , where the neutrino is assumed to be massive and is moving in a circular orbit of radius @xmath56 around the black hole .",
    "any orbit around a massive object in spherically symmetric spacetime has two constants of motion , namely , the energy @xmath57 and the angular momentum @xmath58 .",
    "however for a massive particle it is convenient to work with energy and angular momentum per unit mass , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the discussion below by energy and angular momentum for a massive particle , will always imply energy and angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "+ given the radius @xmath56 of the circular orbit we can determine explicitly the energy per unit mass @xmath61 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath62 in terms of @xmath56 .",
    "the expression for four velocity , energy and angular momentum so obtained is given explicitly in appendix [ neu : appb ] .",
    "then we can determine the spin precession frequency explicitly with the following expression : @xmath63\\ ] ] note that even though we have two functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the spin precession is mostly dominated from the contributions of @xmath64 , while @xmath65 appears for a ride .",
    "note that in the limit of @xmath66 , we obtain : @xmath67 which was derived earlier @xcite for circular orbit in the schwarzschild spacetime and here verified from our general analysis .",
    "thus we have derived the expression for spin precession frequency for a massive neutrino moving in a circular orbit in the spherically symmetric spacetime of . * in the literature quite frequently neutrino is taken to move along null trajectory . thus it is important to ask , what happens to the spin precession as the neutrino is taken to move on photon circular orbits .",
    "this can be obtained directly from by taking appropriate null limit . for circular orbit the null limit",
    "is approached when one approaches the photon circular orbit , i.e. , circular null geodesics located at @xmath68 ( see in appendix [ neu : appb ] ) .",
    "note that since energy and angular momentum are defined as respective quantities per unit mass the null limit works out finely .",
    "it turns out that by taking appropriate limit i.e. , @xmath69 , the spin oscillation frequency identically vanishes , leading to , @xmath70=0\\ ] ] the same result can also be argued from the expression for @xmath55 obtained explicitly for null trajectory .",
    "following appendix [ neu : appb ] , it turns out that @xmath55 scales as @xmath71 , where @xmath61 is the energy of the neutrino on the null trajectory , which for high energy limit , would tend to the above null result .",
    "note that this result is true for arbitrary static and stationary spacetime . for a very wide class of solutions",
    "this result remains true , as we have not used any specific form of the metric keeping the spacetime completely general .",
    "* in general , if we consider an orbit with non - zero energy and angular momentum then we have an expression for spin oscillation frequency in general .",
    "it turns out that for zero angular momentum the oscillation frequency vanishes .",
    "hence for radial motion there is no oscillation in the spin space and thus the spin of the neutrino remains fixed for such trajectories .",
    "hence for a general timelike orbit the oscillation frequency takes the following form , @xmath72\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath61 stands for the energy per unit mass and @xmath62 accounts for the angular momentum per unit mass of the particle moving on the geodesic .",
    "since the mass of neutrino is very small , it is highly relativistic .",
    "thus we are really interested in the high energy limit of the above expression , which can be obtained by assuming @xmath73 and then neglecting higher order terms of the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "this finally leads to the following expression for spin oscillation frequency : @xmath75\\ ] ] from the above expression it is evident that for @xmath76 , @xmath77 vanishes in the high energy limit . from we find that this is precisely the photon circular orbit .",
    "hence our previous result can directly be verified from this line of arguments as well .",
    "we have derived the spin oscillation frequency of a neutrino along various trajectories . among them",
    "we have shown that our general result for spin oscillation frequency in circular orbits matches with previous results in the limit of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "also we have demonstrated that the oscillation frequency vanishes along null circular trajectories .",
    "this was shown earlier in the context of schwarzschild spacetime , while in this case we have shown the applicability of the result from a more general standpoint .",
    "in later sections we shall apply these results to determine helicity flip of neutrino and associated parameter space for its detection .",
    "in this section , we will start by first reviewing some basic results about two flavour neutrino oscillation in flat spacetime .",
    "the eigenstates of the neutrino in flavour basis is denoted by @xmath78 , which is considered as a superposition of eigenstates in mass basis , denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "then the transformation from flavour basis to mass basis is considered to be performed by an unitary transformation @xmath80 and an associated phase @xmath81 , such that , @xmath82 .",
    "here , @xmath83 and @xmath84 represents the energy and momentum of the @xmath85-th mass eigenstate .",
    "then for motion of a neutrino from a point a to another point b the phase in general can be interpreted as , @xmath86 where , @xmath87 signifies the @xmath85-th mass eigenstate with @xmath88 being the corresponding mass .",
    "this is considered as generalization of neutrino phase to curved spacetime if we interpret the four - momentum of the neutrino as , @xmath89 , where , @xmath90 is the spacetime metric and @xmath91 is the proper time along the trajectory of the particle .",
    "then it turns out that in the high energy limit i.e. @xmath92 along with weak field approximation we arrive at the standard oscillation phase for two flavour neutrino oscillation @xcite .",
    "let us start our analysis by first considering neutrino flavour oscillation in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime . then after deriving the expressions for oscillation probability and oscillation length in the general case",
    ", we will apply these results for some specific situations in alternative theories , which in turn will constrain various parameters of these models . for these purposes",
    "we will follow ref .",
    "the detailed expressions are being provided in appendix [ neu : appa ] , we will summarize the important results and shall provide the physical insights behind these results .    for the general metric ansatz presented in we have two conserved quantities the energy and angular momentum .",
    "also the motion is taken to be confined in the equatorial plane .",
    "thus the phase along null geodesic turns out to be : @xmath93\\ ] ] where , the potential @xmath94 turns out to have the expression : @xmath95 and the index k merely specifies that we are considering kth massive neutrino . the standard result for phase can be obtained from the high energy limit , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the null phase : @xmath98 which exactly matches with the respective result for schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "as the neutrino travels with speed very close to that of light it is considered to have traveled along a null line",
    ". however it would be more appropriate to calculate the phase along a timelike trajectory .",
    "these two phases differ necessarily as we have taken neutrino to be massive but moving along null geodesic .",
    "then for timelike geodesic the phase turns out to be : @xmath99 \\approx \\int _",
    "{ a}^{b}\\frac{m_{k}dr}{e_{k_{m}}}=2\\phi _ { k_{m}}^{\\rm{null}}\\ ] ] thus we found that phase along null and timelike trajectory differ by a factor of 2 even for the most general spherically symmetric spacetime discussed here .",
    "this factor exists in the flat @xcite , schwarzschild @xcite , kerr - newmann @xcite and in various alternative gravity theories with solutions having @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the coherence effects , i.e. , assume that neutrinos of different flavours are created at the same spacetime point and are also detected at the same spacetime point , then this phase difference is irrelevant for interference . in this particular situation",
    "as well we have approximated the trajectory of ultra - relativistic neutrinos as null geodesics which starts and ends at the same spacetime point and thus this factor would not show up in interference .",
    "however in principle one could have chosen more complicated trajectories as well ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however as argued in @xcite this factor appears in flat spacetime due to wrong use of the group velocity in phase . in curved spacetime as well its origin is embedded in the following reason  we are taking the neutrino to be massive , i.e. , @xmath100 but at the same time we are approximating it to be moving on a null geodesic since it is ultra relativistic .",
    "due to this _ erroneous _ use of two separate formulations in a single problem we are getting this factor of 2 .",
    "having obtained the oscillation phase it is important to consider some non - trivial effect that these alternative theories have on top of the standard schwarzschild coordinates . the best physical observable for this purpose as pointed out in @xcite",
    "is the oscillation length .",
    "the oscillation length can be obtained as @xcite @xmath101 then the differential form of the oscillation phase can be written in terms of differential of proper length from as @xmath102 the remarkable fact about this equation is that the differential phase does not depend on the @xmath103 component .",
    "thus only the @xmath7 component appears in the oscillation phase and thus affect our solutions .",
    "there is another assumption that has gone into the above equation , which corresponds to taking the eigenstates of mass and energy identical .",
    "this has been scrutinized critically by several authors and in general it is assumed that @xmath104 represents common energy of mass eigenstates .",
    "also there is one critical point that we should stress , as the flat spacetime has both time and space invariance , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 carry equal momenta .",
    "however in curved spacetime @xmath105 is a conserved quantity due to existence of timelike killing vector field , which obviously is not true for @xmath106 .",
    "hence the equal momentum assumption does not work in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "hence the phase shift determining the oscillation turns out to be , @xmath107 .",
    "then we can define the oscillation length @xmath108 for neutrino in curved spacetime as , @xmath109 which for a flat spacetime reduces to , @xmath110 .",
    "hence finally the fractional change in oscillation length in presence of gravity turns out to be @xmath111 while the other object of interest turns out to be the change in oscillation length in alternative theories in comparison to the corresponding solution in general relativity .",
    "this one has the following expression @xmath112 in the above expression @xmath113 is the @xmath7 component in the alternative theory and @xmath114 is the corresponding @xmath7 element in spacetime described by general relativity .",
    "next we will try to compute these changes to put bounds on parameters in the theory , which we will compare with the respective parameters using spin oscillation as well .      in general relativity",
    ", schwarzschild solution represents the vacuum solution outside a spherically symmetric massive object . if the mass of the central object becomes comparable to planck scale then also the same solution describes quite well the structure of the spacetime , except for regions near the massive object ( if it forms a black hole , then near the singularity )",
    "however when we bring coupling with maxwell field then the corresponding classical solution , which is the solution gets modified significantly since every solution with non - zero @xmath115 couples with dilaton .",
    "hence the maxwell coupled solution gets drastically modified due to presence of the dilaton field and thus the low energy four dimensional effective action takes the following form as obtained from string theory @xcite : @xmath116\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath117 , is the maxwell field tensor , belonging to the @xmath118 subgroup of @xmath119 .",
    "all other gauge fields except @xmath120 have been set to zero , then for a purely magnetic maxwell field we have , the only non - zero component to be , @xmath121 , leading to , @xmath122 .",
    "it turns out that only three components of ricci tensor are non - zero , with one of them satisfying the relation , @xmath123 .",
    "then the spherically symmetric solution turns out to be @xcite : @xmath124 where , @xmath125 is the surface element on @xmath126 plane , @xmath127 represents the asymptotic value of dilaton and @xmath128 , the black hole charge .",
    "this metric resembles the schwarzschild solution , however with another horizon being located at @xmath129 .",
    "both the and dilaton solution describes a black hole for small @xmath130 ratio , while in other situations ( with @xmath131 ) both describe naked singularity . also from the string theory viewpoint ,",
    "the strings do not couple to the metric @xmath90 but rather to @xmath132 .",
    "then in string @xmath133 model the effective lagrangian leads to the following action @xcite : @xmath134\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this modified action we obtain the following solution for the metric in spherically symmetric coordinate as @xcite : @xmath135\\left[1-(q^{2}e^{3\\phi _ { 0}}/m\\rho ) \\right ] } + \\rho ^{2}d\\omega ^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this line element is exactly in the form of the metric ansatz we started given in .",
    "the most important parameter in this theory is the dilaton charge , which can be obtained by integrating @xmath136 over a two sphere at spatial infinity as @xcite , @xmath137 having obtained the line element we will now compute the oscillation probability and thus the oscillation length . the most important object that appears in all the expressions",
    "correspond to the potential @xmath138 , which in this particular case turns out to have the expression : @xmath139 hence the phase along null geodesic as well as that along timelike geodesic can be computed in a straightforward manner by just substituting the above expression for potential and corresponding expressions for metric elements in and respectively .",
    "then the two oscillation length , first one corresponding to difference from flat spacetime have the following expression : @xmath140 this expression has very little dependence on the charge @xmath128 since for normal astrophysical systems @xmath141 .",
    "the other comparative oscillation length corresponds to the difference from the general relativistic counterpart i.e. the solution .",
    "this comparative oscillation length turns out to have the following expression : @xmath142 finally , we can also compute the oscillation probability for an electron type neutrino to remain an electron type neutrino for various lengths .",
    "then we can compare it with the solar neutrino result in order to constrain various parameters of this theory .",
    "+        the variation of the two comparative oscillation lengths with radial distance have been presented in fig .",
    "[ neu : fig:01 ] .",
    "also the probability for an electron type neutrino to remain another electron type neutrino for a definite energy window has been presented in fig .",
    "[ neu : fig:02 ] .",
    "the fact that we are considering probability of an electron type neutrino to remain an electron type neutrino is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ neu : fig:02 ] as the maximum probability reaches the value unity .",
    "however we can do more , from the neutrino oscillation probability , in this gravity model we can constrain the parameter @xmath143 , defined through using the data for solar neutrino oscillation .",
    "this can be performed along the following lines , since the geometry and hence the oscillation probabilities are different , the theoretical flux would differ from the schwarzschild value and this difference depends upon the dilaton charge . to be compatible with the experiment",
    "the excess flux must be within the statistical errors present in observed fluxes .",
    "this in turn will provide stringent constraints on the dilaton charge @xmath143 .",

    "they can not be used accurately to place tight constraints on the parameter @xmath225 as we have done in the previous two situations .",
    "this originates from the fact that all the corrections are sub - leading and falls off much faster , leaving very little correction in comparison to the previous two cases .",

    "we have observed that for circular motion in the high energy limit , the oscillation frequency vanishes .",
    "this is a _ very important _ result , it suggests that a neutrino moving in a circular orbit does not undergo any change of its spin and hence helicity ( since neutrino is always a highly relativistic particle ) .",

    "this clearly depicts the fact that if we consider only radial motion , the spin oscillation probability identically vanishes .",
    "thus for _ any _ static , spherically symmetric spacetime neutrinos traveling along radial direction would _ not _ suffer helicity flip .",
    "if it was left handed originally it will remain left handed for radial motion .",
    "note that in all the three cases considered above since @xmath221 and @xmath236 are asymptotically flat and there is an additional @xmath237 factor in the probability .",

    "the einstein - hilbert action is supposed to be a low energy realization of the fundamental theory . to keep out the ghost terms",
    "it is instructive to modify the gravity action by including the second order lovelock term which is known in the literature as the gauss bonnet term .",

    "<S> neutrino spin and flavour oscillation in curved spacetime have been studied for the most general static spherically symmetric configuration . </S>",
    "<S> having exploited the spherical symmetry we have confined ourselves to the equatorial plane in order to determine the spin and flavour oscillation frequency in this general set - up . using the symmetry properties we have derived spin oscillation frequency for neutrino moving along a geodesic or in a circular orbit . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the expression of neutrino spin oscillation frequency we have shown that even in this general context , in high energy limit the spin oscillation frequency for neutrino moving along circular orbit vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified previous results along this line by transforming to schwarzschild coordinates under appropriate limit . </S>",
    "<S> this finally lends itself to the probability of neutrino helicity flip which turns out to be non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> while for neutrino flavour oscillation we have derived general results for oscillation phase , which subsequently have been applied to three different gravity theories . </S>",
    "<S> one , of them appears as low - energy approximation to string theory , where we have an additional field , namely , dilaton field coupled to maxwell field tensor . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a realization of reissner - nordstrm solution in string theory at low - energy . </S>",
    "<S> next one corresponds to generalization of schwarzschild solution by introduction of quadratic curvature terms of all possible form to the einstein - hilbert action . finally , we have also discussed regular black hole solutions . in all these cases the flavour oscillation probabilities can be determined for solar neutrinos and thus can be used to put bounds on the parameters of these gravity theories . while for spin oscillation probability , we have considered two cases , gauss - bonnet term added to the einstein - hilbert action and the f(r ) gravity theory . in both these cases </S>",
    "<S> we could impose bounds on the parameters which are consistent with previous considerations . in a nutshell , in this work we have presented both spin and flavour oscillation frequency of neutrino in most general static spherically symmetric spacetime , encompassing a vast class of solutions , which when applied to three such instances in alternative theories for flavour oscillation and two alternative theories for spin oscillation put bounds on the parameters of these theories . </S>",
    "<S> implications are also discussed . </S>"
