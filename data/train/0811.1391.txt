    "<S> the magnetic scattering profiles along the @xmath2^{\\ast}$]- and the @xmath3^{\\ast}$]-directions are well described by the sum of gaussian and modified - lorentzian terms , even far below @xmath4 , indicating that short - range orders coexist with a long - range order . </S>",

    "<S> long - range interactions in magnetic systems , such as the dipolar interaction and the rkky interaction , cause diverse magnetism because of their competing nature . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , ising spin systems , such as prco@xmath0si@xmath0  @xcite and cesb @xcite , reveal long - period magnetic soliton structures and complicated successive phase transitions in temperature ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) . on the other hand , long - period helically modulated magnetic structures </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic anisotropy varies from the ising - type to the xy - type systematically as magnetic rare - earth r@xmath9-ions being heavier @xcite . in spite of the simple crystallographic structure , the rt@xmath0x@xmath0-system exhibits rich magnetic properties , such as incommensurate magnetic structures and complicated @xmath10 phase diagrams @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the tetragonal ab - plane is the magnetic easy plane and the magnetization along the c - axis is less than 1/10 of the ab - plane magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> according to neutron powder diffraction experiments @xcite , erni@xmath0ge@xmath0  has a long - period sinusoidally modulated magnetic structure with the magnetic wave vector @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 and the magnetic ordered moment forms an angle 64@xmath16 with the c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic structure is inconsistent with strong easy - plane type anisotropy observed in the magnetization measurements . in ref.@xcite , </S>",

    "<S> only the component of magnetic moment @xmath1 perpendicular to @xmath19 , @xmath23 , contributes to the magnetic neutron scattering . in the polarized neutron scattering experiments , the component of @xmath23 perpendicular and parallel to @xmath18 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , </S>",

    "<S> the configurations of the @xmath19 , the @xmath18 and the @xmath23 in the present experimental conditions are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) , and the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 are listed in table [ tab1 ] . in the ( a - i)- and the ( b - i)-conditions , </S>",
    "<S> only the sf scattering channel was observed , because the scatterings at @xmath20 and @xmath32 are purely magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> observed very weak nsf scatterings are due to the incompleteness of the neutron polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities of the sf and the nsf scattering are almost the same in the ( a - ii)-condition , indicating the isotropic magnetic ordered moment in ab - plane . </S>",
    "<S> the nsf scattering in the ( b - ii)-condition was not observed any more than that in the ( a - i)- or the ( b - i)-condition was . because the lattice constant @xmath46 is much longer than @xmath47 , @xmath46 @xmath12 @xmath48   and @xmath47 @xmath12 @xmath49  , the scattering vector in the ( b)-condition is almost parallel to the @xmath2^{\\ast}$]-axis , i.e. @xmath50 @xmath12 @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath12 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an angle between the @xmath2^{\\ast}$]-axis and the scattering vector . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the nsf scattering in the ( b - ii ) condition is contributed by the c - component of the magnetic ordered moment @xmath28 mostly and the lack of the nsf scattering indicates the lack of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 was estimated to be 1/10 of the component in the ab - plane @xmath55 at most , being consistent with the anisotropy observed in the single crystal magnetization measurements . magnetic scattering at the 3rd higher harmonic position , </S>",

    "<S> for a numerical analysis of the scattering profiles along the @xmath2^{\\ast}$]- and the @xmath3^{\\ast}$]-axes , we used the following functional form @xmath65 with the gaussian resolution functions , @xmath69^{\\theta } }   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath70 ( @xmath12 @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 are an inverse correlation length and a component of @xmath73 in the ab - plane , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the diffuse scattering component was not observed at all above and below @xmath11 in nuclear scattering profiles . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the observed magnetic short - range order does not come from neither crystallographic disorder nor chemical distortion driven by the antiferromagnetic transition through magnetoelastic couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the diffuse scattering strongly suggests that the magnetic short - range order consists of one dimensional long - range helices along the c - axis , and the ` phase ' of the helix fluctuates with ferromagnetic correlations in the ab - plane . </S>",
    "<S> it looks similar to the kosterlitz - thouless phase in two dimensional ferromagnetic xy spin systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frustration coming from the competing long - range interactions in the ab - plane could derive such short - range order . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the ising system , i.e. tbru@xmath0si@xmath0  @xcite , reveals quite complicated , but being long - ranged , two dimensional patterns in the ab - plane . in erni@xmath0ge@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the xy - like continuous freedom of the phase of the helix may allow existence of the short - range order with the finite correlation length @xmath83 @xmath21 @xmath84 in the long - range order . </S>"
