    "some of the most dramatic phenomena of astrophysics , such as quasars and powerful radio galaxies , are most likely powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . nevertheless , smbhs appear to spend most of their time in a remarkably quiescent state .",
    "smbhs are embedded in the relatively dense environments of galactic nuclei , and it is natural to suppose that the gravity due to an smbh will draw in matter at high rates , leading to a high system luminosity . however",
    ", this simple prediction often fails as many systems are much dimmer than one would expect .    to illustrate a key problem in constructing theoretical models for accretion onto a black hole ,",
    "let us express the luminosity due to accretion as @xmath1 where we invoke the simplest assumption , that the luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate , @xmath2 , and an efficiency factor , @xmath3 .",
    "the accretion luminosity is very uncertain because @xmath3 is uncertain : @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 in a standard , radiatively efficient thin disk , to @xmath5 for spherically symmetric accretion from a low density medium ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; shapiro 1973 ; mszros 1975 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate is also a source of uncertainty in estimates of the accretion luminosity because @xmath2 depends on the physical conditions and geometry at large distances from the black hole .",
    "nevertheless , it is customary to adopt the analytic formula due to bondi ( 1952 ) to estimate the mass accretion rate . in his classic paper , bondi ( 1952 )",
    "considered spherically symmetric accretion from a non - rotating polytropic gas with uniform density @xmath6 and sound speed @xmath7 at infinity . under these assumptions , a steady state solution to the equations of mass and momentum conservation exists with a mass accretion rate of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless parameter that , for the newtonian potential , depends only on the adiabatic index .",
    "the bondi radius , @xmath10 , is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant and @xmath13 is the mass of the accretor .",
    "the bondi accretion formula predicts that smbhs in typical galaxies should be more luminous than observations indicate when @xmath3 is assumed to be as large as in a standard , radiatively efficient thin disk ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , 2001 ; loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; baganoff et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the context of equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "one possible explanation for this disagreement is that the black hole accretion flow can be radiatively inefficient because binding energy dissipated in the gas is advected through the event horizon before being radiated ( ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    ". however , pure advection - dominated inflow may not be the whole story .",
    "even before recent observations forced us to confront very low smbh luminosities , theorists had begun to realize that rotating , radiatively inefficient hydrodynamical ( hd ) flows are subject to strong convection ( begelman & meier 1982 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) , which can fundamentally change the flow pattern and its radiative properties ( blandford & begelman 1999 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ; narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "the theoretical studies showed that convection alters the steep ( @xmath14 ) density profiles of the advection - dominated flow into a much flatter ( @xmath15 ) profile , which can explain the faintness of many smbhs because it predicts relatively low density close to the black hole ( i.e. , @xmath2 is low in eq .  2 ) .",
    "similar structural changes occur in the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) limit ( stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley , balbus , & stone 2001 ; machida , matsumoto & mineshige 2001 ; igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ) , although here the turbulence is probably driven by magnetorotational instability ( mri ) rather than thermal convection ( balbus & hawley 2002 ; but see abramowicz et al .",
    "2002 and narayan et al .",
    "2002 for alternative views ) .    the turbulent character of both hd and mhd models does not settle the issue of what happens to the energy and angular momentum that must be transported away .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( i ) turbulent transport effectively shuts off the accretion flow , turning it into a closed circulation ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) or ( ii ) turbulent transport drives powerful outflows that can strongly modify the black hole s environment ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "recent mhd simulations bring new insights that may help us to resolve this issue .",
    "for example , hawley & balbus s ( 2002 ) three - dimensional mhd simulations show that , with and without resistive heating , mass and energy in nonradiative accretion flows are carried off by an outflow in keeping with the outline of the second possibility .",
    "another possible solution to the problem of very low smbh luminosity is that mass is captured into the accretion flow at a rate that is far lower that @xmath16 .",
    "thus , a complete formulation of the accretion flow must also consider the outer boundary conditions .",
    "smbhs draw matter from an extended medium and most authors assume that the bondi ( 1952 ) formula provides an adequate approximation for the rate of mass supply . there has been little systematic work done to demonstrate that this assumption is justified and correct .",
    "igumenshchev & narayan ( 2002 ) showed that even non - rotating bondi accretion can be altered , in particular that the mass accretion rate can be reduced below the bondi rate .",
    "the cause of the @xmath2 reduction in igumenshchev & narayan s simulations is the local generation of energy through by magnetic reconnection , which leads to the development of efficient convection .",
    "however , in igumenshchev & narayan s simulations the flow was supersonically injected into the computational grid through the outer boundary , at a specified rate ( determined from the bondi formula ) .",
    "their calculations did not address self - consistently the problem of the mass accretion and supply rate because the latter was fixed at the outer boundary .",
    "as we mention above , the bondi formula has been derived under the assumption that the gas is non - rotating and only under the influence of the central gravity .",
    "thus , for a given gravitational field , the gas internal energy determines the accretion rate . by relaxing this assumption , introducing additional forces or sources of energy",
    ", one may find that the mass supply rate is much lower than the one predicted by the bondi formula .",
    "for example , the rate at which matter is captured by a black hole can be severely limited when the matter is heated by x - rays produced near the black hole ( ostriker et al .",
    "1976 ) or by mass outflow from the central region ( di matteo et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in these two cases , the gas internal energy is increased .",
    "introducing kinetic energy to the gas at infinity may have a similar effect : although the flow outside the bondi accretion radius often can be described as nonrotating , even a tiny amount of angular momentum , @xmath17  when followed inward  could severely limit the rate at which matter is captured by the black hole .",
    "our focus shall be on assessing the gross properties of rotating accretion flows onto black holes .",
    "we consider a classic bondi accretion flow with the only modifications being the introduction of a small , latitude - dependent angular momentum at infinity and a pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "the imposed angular momentum is small enough to have a negligible effect on the density distribution at the outer boundary , which remains spherically symmetric .",
    "therefore , matter near the rotational axis can be accreted .",
    "we thus consider a very simple model of an accretion flow , far simpler than those occurring in nature , as we neglect the gravitational field due to the host galaxy , radiative heating and cooling , viscosity and mhd effects .",
    "for example , we will not consider here the transport of energy and angular momentum outward , as needed to accrete matter with a specific angular momentum higher than @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the radius of a schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented here provide a useful exploratory study of accretion onto black holes .",
    "in particular , our results constitute a `` baseline '' for evaluating the effects of dissipative and transport processes in subsequent work .",
    "they also serve as a `` proof - of - concept '' for the reduction of the mass accretion rate due to a small angular momentum in the accretion flow .      before we embark on a detailed analysis and numerical hd simulations , we first consider the problem of accretion of low-@xmath17 material in a general way . if the matter far from the smbh ( well outside the bondi radius ) has a uniform density and a specific angular momentum , @xmath17 , which exceeds @xmath20  a tiny value compared to the keplerian angular momentum at @xmath10  then no accretion will take place without angular momentum transport . after a transient episode of infall ,",
    "the gas will pile up outside the black hole and settle into a nearly steady state atmosphere bounded by a centrifugal barrier near the rotation axis .",
    "realistically , matter far from the smbh will have a range of angular momenta , and in a steady state with axisymmetry , there will always be low-@xmath17 material close to the axis that can accrete steadily through a funnel along the rotational axis .    for this highly idealized problem",
    ", one would expect that the mass accretion rate should scale with the dependence of the angular momentum on the polar angle , @xmath21 , at the outer radius , @xmath22 : the larger the amount of the material with @xmath23 at @xmath22 , the lower the mass accretion rate . this geometrical argument on the nature of the @xmath2 @xmath24",
    "@xmath17 relation can be quantified as follows .",
    "if the angular momentum depends on @xmath21 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 on the equator ( @xmath27 ) and monotonically decreases to zero at the poles ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , then a naive expectation would be that @xmath30 scales with the solid angle within which @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the width of the angular distribution for which @xmath34 .",
    "the latter can be formally defined as @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 represents the functional inverse of @xmath37 .",
    "this simple geometrical argument is based on the assumption of radial flow and implies that if @xmath38 the material will be accreted approximately at the bondi rate . if relation ( 6 ) were true then the accretion rate should decrease with increasing @xmath39 for a fixed @xmath40 .",
    "additionally , one would expect that @xmath30 should be independent of @xmath10 for fixed @xmath40 and @xmath39 . however , to determine the actual mass accretion rate even in this idealized case we need to perform numerical simulations , as just hd effects of the inviscid fluid make the above geometrical argument invalid both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "the main result of our numerical hd calculations is that the properties of the accretion flow do not depend as much on the outer boundary conditions ( i.e. , the amount as well as distribution of the angular momentum ) as on the geometry of the _ non - accreting matter_. material with @xmath41 can not accrete and forms a thick torus near the equator .",
    "this thick torus and its formation have been a subject of numerous studies ( see below ) .",
    "our simulations show that the dependence of angular momentum on @xmath21 in the torus gets weaker with decreasing radius .",
    "the material with @xmath41 inflows in the polar region , turns around as it reaches a centrifugal barrier , and then starts to outflow along the equator . as a result ,",
    "a thick torus of nearly uniform specific angular momentum forms as gas of the highest angular momentum ( @xmath42 ) near the equator is replaced by gas of lower angular momentum ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the geometry of the polar region , where material is accreted ( the funnel ) and the mass accretion rate through it are constrained by the size and shape of the torus .",
    "we describe the size of the torus by an angle , @xmath43 , between the torus s upper envelope and the pole at a characteristic radius .",
    "our hd models show that the @xmath2 @xmath24 @xmath17 relation has three regimes for a given @xmath44 : ( i ) for low @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath45 for all @xmath21 at large radii ) , the torus does not form and @xmath46 , ( ii ) for intermediate @xmath17 , or more appropriately where there is a narrow range of @xmath21 for which @xmath47 so @xmath48 , @xmath49 with the actual value of the constant depending on the ratio @xmath50 and ( iii ) for high @xmath17 , or in the case for which @xmath51 at nearly all @xmath21 so @xmath52 , @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath39 .    comparing the @xmath2 @xmath24 @xmath17 relation based on our hd models with that described by equation ( 5 )",
    ", we find that the two relations agree exactly in the first regime , disagree qualitatively and quantitatively in the second regime [ the hd models predict @xmath2 lower than eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] , and agree again but only qualitatively in the third region [ the hd models predict @xmath2 higher than eq .",
    "thus the geometrical argument used above does not hold . however",
    ", we can use a modified version to describe the key aspects of the @xmath2 @xmath24 @xmath17 relation .",
    "the modification to the geometrical argument is to replace the solid angle within which @xmath31 at the outer boundary , @xmath53 , with the solid angle within which @xmath31 at _ a characteristic radius comparable with the sonic radius _ , @xmath54 ( i.e. , the solid angle of the accretion funnel ) .",
    "thus , @xmath55 .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath2 to the angular momentum at infinity , in the second regime , can be attributed to the relative insensitivity of the torus , and thus the funnel , to the angular momentum distribution at infinity . in terms of the solid angle within which @xmath45 , this corresponds to @xmath56 for variable @xmath39 ,",
    "provided that @xmath57 ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath2 with increasing @xmath39 , in the third regime , can be attributed to the fact that @xmath54 decreases with increasing @xmath39 , provided that @xmath58 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we find that the mass accretion rate decreases with increasing @xmath39 more slowly than predicted by eq .",
    "( 5 ) in the third regime because the sonic point radius starts to increase as the funnel gets narrower .",
    "similar calculations have been performed before .",
    "for example , the formation of rotationally supported thick tori from inviscid accretion of gas with various initial angular momentum distributions has been reported ( hawley , smarr & wilson 1984a ; 1984b ; clarke , karpik & henriksen 1985 ; hawley 1986 ; molteni , lanzafame & chakrabarti 1994 ; ryu et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .",
    "however , there is one key difference between our work and some past work : our outer radial boundary is located outside the bondi radius and we adopt subsonic , bondi - like outer radial conditions whereas molteni et al .",
    "1994 , ryu et al .",
    "1995 , and chen et al .",
    "1997 ( see also toropin et al . 1999 ; kryukov et al . 2000 ; and igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ) imposed outer boundary conditions inside the bondi radius or even inside the sonic radius .",
    "the latter approach allows one to study cases where @xmath50 is as low as in some real systems ( e.g. , @xmath59 in chen et al .",
    "1997 ) but this approach is not suitable for addressing our main issue : what is the mass supply rate . the approach adopted by hawley et al .",
    "( 1984a , 1984b ) , clarke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and hawley ( 1986 ) is much closer to ours as they also used subsonic outer boundary conditions .",
    "however , these authors did not consider how the accretion rate onto the black hole depends on the angular momentum distribution beyond the bondi radius but rather focused on the formation of the thick torus .",
    "as far as the treatment of the outer radial boundary is concerned , our simulations are also similar for those of ruffert ( 1994 ) , who studied three - dimensional hydrodynamic bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "other studies are also relevant to our work .",
    "several authors considered accretion onto black holes with a focus on the evolution of rotationally supported thick tori including the transport of angular momentum and energy ( e.g. , igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; stone & pringle 2001 ; machida et al .",
    "2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ) .",
    "the main difference between our work and these studies is that the other authors adopt the point of view that virtually all of the material at large radii has too much angular momentum to be accreted without the transport of angular momentum .",
    "they assume that material with zero or very low angular momentum is unimportant dynamically , and that accretion is dominated by angular momentum and energy transport processes .",
    "for example , for their initial conditions stone et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and hawley & balbus ( 2002 ) adopted a bounded torus in hydrostatic equilibrium with constant angular momentum , embedded in zero angular momentum ambient gas which is also in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "thus , these calculations were set up so that , if not for the transport of angular momentum , there would be neither time evolution nor mass accretion .",
    "we recognize that transport processes are essential , but assert that the zero or very low angular momentum material also deserves a rigorous treatment because it can play an important role in determining the total mass supply and accretion rate .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a far simpler case of an accretion flow than those occurring in nature ( see section  4 ) .",
    "for example , we neglect viscosity and mhd effects .",
    "in particular , the mri has been shown to be a very robust and universal mechanism to produce turbulence and the transport of angular momentum in disks at all radii ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our calculations in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we present our results .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss them together with their limitations in section 4 .",
    "to calculate the structure and evolution of an accreting flow , we solve the equations of hydrodynamics @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass density , @xmath64 is the gas pressure , @xmath65 is the velocity , and @xmath66 is the internal energy density .",
    "we adopt an adiabatic equation of state @xmath67 , and consider models with @xmath68 .",
    "our calculations are performed in spherical polar coordinates @xmath69 .",
    "we assume axial symmetry about the rotational axis of the accretion flow ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we present simulations using the pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath70 introduced by paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) @xmath71 this potential approximates general relativistic effects in the inner regions , for a nonrotating black hole . in particular , the paczyski  wiita potential reproduces the last stable circular orbit at @xmath72 as well as the marginally bound orbit at @xmath73 .      for the initial conditions we adopt a bondi accretion flow with zero angular momentum everywhere except for the outermost part of the flow .",
    "in what follows we briefly review the basics of bondi accretion that allow us to specify details of our initial and boundary conditions as well as to interpret our results .",
    "the bernoulli function can be written as @xmath74 where h is the enthalpy and @xmath75 is the specific angular momentum . for a polytropic equation of state @xmath76 ,",
    "the polytropic constant can been expressed as @xmath77 , where @xmath7 is the sound speed at infinity [ i.e. , @xmath78 .",

    "this is in contrast to the purely newtonian case in which @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "we will use the results for bondi accretion with the pw potential [ i.e. , equations ( 17)-(20 ) ] as a reference point for analyzing our results and to set the initial conditions .",

    "we also ran a few models in which the specific angular momentum initially is non - zero only at the outer radial boundary @xmath22 .",
    "we found that , except for the initial transient , models with these initial conditions for @xmath17 give the same results .",
    "however , adopting a non - zero specific angular momentum @xmath17 for @xmath103 reduces the computational time significantly because the initial transient lasts for a much shorter time .",

    "we focus our attention on accretion of matter with low angular momentum , i.e. , where the corresponding centrifugal force is small compared to gravity for all @xmath21 at the bondi radius : @xmath145 in the limit @xmath146 and using our definition of @xmath107 , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath147    table  1 summarizes the properties of the simulations we discuss here . columns ( 2 ) through ( 7 ) give the numerical resolution in the radial direction ; the black hole radius compared to the bondi radius , @xmath101 ; the circularization radius compared to the bondi radius , @xmath107 ; the specific angular momentum on the equator at @xmath148 , @xmath39 , in units of @xmath18 ; the width of the angular distribution for which @xmath34 , @xmath33 ; and the angular momentum dependence on the polar angle at the outer boundary , @xmath44 , respectively . table  1 also presents the final time at which we stopped each simulation ( all times here are in units of the keplerian orbital time at @xmath149 ) , the maximum specific angular momentum at the inner radial boundary , @xmath150 , and the time - averaged mass accretion rate through the inner radial boundary measured near the end of the simulation , in units of the corresponding bondi accretion rate .",
    "finally , column ( 11 ) gives comments about runs different from the standard runs ( e.g. , the outer radial boundary set at @xmath151 instead of @xmath152 )    our simulations show that for @xmath153 the accretion flow consists of a thick , equatorial torus where the material has too much angular momentum to be accreted , and a supersonic polar funnel where the material has @xmath17 low enough to be accreted .",
    "we describe an example of such an accretion flow in some detail first ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "this is followed by a limited parameter survey in which we focus on varying three key aspects of our models : the maximum angular momentum for a given distribution , the angular distribution of angular momentum on the outer boundary , and the black hole radius compared to the bondi radius .      in this section",
    "we describe the properties and behavior of our model in which @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 ( model b04f1a ) . for the above parameters , the specific angular momentum on the equator at the outer boundary is @xmath157 in units of @xmath18 , thus the material that can not be accreted onto the black hole",
    "is located relatively close to the equator , @xmath158 at the outer boundary .",

    "the low-@xmath17 material close to the axis accretes almost steadily through a funnel .",
    "the distribution of specific angular momentum in the torus becomes increasingly homogeneous as material with @xmath160 replaces material with higher @xmath17 .",
    "the flow in the torus is subsonic , variable and is directed outward near the equator and inward close to the poles .",
    "there is no symmetry with respect to the equator .",
    "the time - dependence persists even after @xmath161=9 .",
    "thus , a meridional circulation is established in the torus .",

    "figure  2 presents the enlargement of two panels from figure  1 ( the panels from the the end of our simulations ) .",
    "this figure shows also the radial sonic surface , that is , the location where the radial mach number ( @xmath162 ) equals one .",
    "note that the specific angular momentum in the torus for small radii is nearly constant ( @xmath163 in units of @xmath18 ) .",
    "additionally , for small radii the sonic surface approximately coincides with the @xmath164 surface .",
    "the ` south ' lobe of the sonic surface is more elongated than the ` north ' lobe at the end of the simulations .",

    "figure  3 is a plot of the angular dependence of the mach number , specific angular momentum and mass flux density at @xmath165 .",
    "this figure shows three important features of the accretion flow : ( i ) the accretion flow is highly supersonic in the radial direction , ( ii ) @xmath166 is not @xmath18 but rather somewhat smaller ( @xmath167 ) and ( iii ) the mass flux density is a strong function of the polar angle : it is nearly flat near the poles and peaks near the equator where @xmath168 in units of @xmath18 .    to provide more insight into the character of the accretion flow , figure  4 shows the angular dependence of flow properties on the sonic surface ( the @xmath169 surface ) .",

    "we define @xmath173 as the difference between a given polar angle , @xmath21 , on the sonic surface , and the polar angle at which the gas with a given @xmath17 originated at @xmath148 . because our models conserve specific angular momentum along streamlines , @xmath173 can be formally estimated as @xmath174 for @xmath127 and @xmath175 for @xmath129 .",
    "figure  4 shows that the sonic radius is the highest along the poles , comparable to the bondi sonic radius [ see eq .",
    "( 19 ) ] and decreases by approximately an order of magnitude near the equator ( see also figure  2 ) .",
    "additionally , figure  4 shows that the flow deviates from radial flow on the sonic surface . the deviation from radial flow increases with increasing angle from the poles . for angles from the poles",
    "@xmath176 , the deviation is small and the radial approximation holds .",
    "however , the mass flux density is dominated by matter originating at angles from @xmath177 from the poles , for which the deviation from radial flow can be large ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) .",
    "we note that the total mass accretion rate is dominated by streamlines which deviate only moderately from radial flow on the sonic surface .",
    "this conclusion is based on the observation that @xmath179 for material with @xmath180 .    finally , to provide some insight into the time dependence ,",
    "figure  5 shows the time evolution of the mass accretion rate in units of the corresponding bondi rate .",
    "initially , @xmath2 drops from 1 to 0.23 at t  =  0.25 .",
    "then it starts oscillating around 0.3 with an amplitude of @xmath181 .      to check the trends of the accretion flow with the main model parameters , we have performed a limited parameter survey .",
    "we first describe our results for models with all parameters the same as in model b04f1a except for @xmath39 .",
    "the main result from our runs with various @xmath39 is that the mass accretion rate does not depend on this parameter ( see table  1 ) , within the constraints imposed by assuming low angular momentum at @xmath10 [ eq . ( 27 ) ] .",
    "the basic reason for this result is the fact that the properties of the accretion flow are determined by the geometry of the torus , which has a uniform specific angular momentum slightly larger than the maximum @xmath17 of the accreted gas .",
    "the material with @xmath41 inflows in the polar region , turns around as it reaches a centrifugal barrier , and then starts to outflow along the equator . as a result ,",
    "a thick torus forms with gas of the highest angular momentum ( @xmath42 ) near the equator being replaced by gas of lower angular momentum ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the geometry of the polar region , where material is accreted ( the funnel ) and the mass accretion rate through it are constrained by the shape of the torus .    to illustrate the insensitivity of the inner flow to the angular momentum at large radii",
    ", figure  6 shows the angular momentum contours for our model b01f1a at @xmath182 . for this model we assumed @xmath183 so that in the purely radial case all material should be accreted .",
    "however , the flow converges toward the equator , and gas pressure effects allow only the material with @xmath184 to be accreted . the material with higher @xmath17 turns around and forms a thick torus with properties very similar to those of model b04f1a , which has a much higher @xmath17 at large radii .",
    "comparing the left - hand panel of figure  6 with the top panels of figure  1 shows clearly how different the angular momentum distributions are at large radii in these two runs .",
    "however , comparing the right - hand panel of figure  6 with the left - hand panel of figure  2 shows that the angular momentum distribution at small radii , the shape of the torus ( the @xmath185 contour ) as well as the sonic surface are qualitatively similar for both runs .",
    "we conclude that the relative insensitivity of the torus to the angular momentum distribution at infinity is responsible for the fact that @xmath2 does not depend on @xmath39 and that the geometrical argument we used in section  1 is invalid .",
    "as runs b04f1a and b01f1a illustrate , the width of the @xmath17 distribution for @xmath45 at infinity does not control the mass accretion rate .",
    "even if material with low @xmath17 comes from close to the equator it still has to go ` around ' the inner torus .",
    "we suggest that a more useful way of geometrically determining the mass accretion rate is to compare the angle between the torus upper envelope and the pole , @xmath43 , and the width of the angular distribution for which @xmath186 , @xmath33 .",
    "however , such a method of determining @xmath2 poses the difficulty that @xmath43 depends on radius and we need to know at what radius we have to measure @xmath43 .      motivated by the conclusion from the previous section ,",
    "we have performed a few simulations using an angular distribution for @xmath17 that yields a smaller value of @xmath33 than that given by @xmath113 ( see eq .",
    "23 ) , for a given @xmath39 .",
    "we wish to check whether the insensitivity of @xmath2 to @xmath39 , as described above , holds in cases where @xmath33 is small , in particular when @xmath187 .    inspection of the expression ( 27 ) shows that there are three possible ways of decreasing @xmath33 within the constraints imposed by the assumption of low angular momentum : ( i ) reduce @xmath107 by increasing @xmath10 for given @xmath188 and @xmath40 and increase @xmath39 at the same time , ( ii ) choose a function @xmath44 that increases with increasing @xmath21 very quickly for small @xmath21 and very slowly for larger @xmath21 , or ( iii ) both",
    ". we will be able to explore the first possibility only in a limited way ( see next section ) because , as we mentioned above , models with @xmath10 very high compared to @xmath40 are very demanding computationally .",
    "however , we can explore the second possibility at relatively low computational cost for moderate @xmath10 .",
    "as before , we consider in detail only one example : for our model b08f2a , all parameters are the same as for model b04f1a with the exceptions that @xmath17 scales with @xmath21 at @xmath22 as @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "such a flat distribution of @xmath17 for high @xmath21 reduces the size of the polar region where @xmath45 ( i.e. , the @xmath33 angle ) .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath52 in this case and the mass accretion rate will be lower than in model b04f1a . indeed , we find that @xmath2 in model b08f2a is lower than that for model b04f1a by a factor of @xmath191 .",
    "we observe a similar reduction of @xmath2 for all runs using @xmath114 compared to runs using @xmath113 , regardless of @xmath50 .",
    "our experiments with various @xmath39 and angular distributions of @xmath17 show that @xmath33 appears to be the key parameter that determines the effect of the angular momentum at the outer boundary on the mass accretion rate through the inner boundary . to illustrate the role of @xmath33 , figure  7 plots the mass accretion rate as a function of @xmath192 for all our runs with @xmath193 , without making any distinction between models with different @xmath44 and/or @xmath39 .",
    "figure  7 shows one of the key results of this paper . for large @xmath33",
    " corresponding to a broad funnel at @xmath10  @xmath2 is constant , whereas for small @xmath33  corresponding to a narrow funnel at @xmath10  @xmath2 decreases with decreasing @xmath33 .",
    "figure  7 also compares our numerical results ( the solid line ) with the simple prediction , eq .",
    "( 5 ) ( the dashed line ) .",
    "equation ( 5 ) predicts that @xmath2 decreases monotonically with decreasing @xmath33 for all @xmath21 .",
    "generally , our prediction from section  1 overestimates @xmath2 for large @xmath33 and underestimates @xmath2 for small @xmath33 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath33 shown in our numerical simulations is consistent with the theoretical prediction , but only qualitatively and only in the limit of a narrow funnel .",
    "we note that in the limit of a narrow funnel the sonic radius increases with decreasing @xmath33 .",
    "we can understand the @xmath2 @xmath24 @xmath33 relation in the limit of a narrow funnel by combining this increase in the sonic radius with two other facts : ( i ) the solid angle subtended by the accretion funnel decreases with increasing radius and ( ii ) the solid angle subtended by the accretion funnel is greater than @xmath53 ( @xmath194 at @xmath22 by definition ) .",
    "thus , @xmath54 and consequently @xmath2 decrease with decreasing @xmath33 .",
    "this explains why the decrease of @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath33 shown in our numerical simulations is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the explanation for the quantitative difference is simply related to the second fact listed above , i.e. , @xmath195 at the sonic radius , @xmath196 .",
    "the most difficult parameters of our models to explore are the @xmath50 ratio and the outer radius of the computational domain .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have to consider values of @xmath50 orders magnitude larger than those found in astrophysical objects .",
    "similarly , exploring a wide range of @xmath22 is computationally prohibitive .",
    "therefore we have performed only a few simulations in which we vary these parameters .",
    "we check then whether our results allow us to extrapolate an @xmath197 @xmath24 @xmath50 relation to very low values of @xmath50 .",
    "our results from the runs with various @xmath22 allow us to make a few observations .",
    "first , a proper study of bondi accretion with low angular momentum requires @xmath198 . for @xmath199 or larger , the assumption of low angular momentum ( eq .",
    "27 ) is valid only for a very narrow range of @xmath39 while the assumption of radial flow at the outer boundary is valid only for @xmath22 much larger than the bondi radius .",
    "for example , our models a03f1a and a03f1b show that the location of the outer boundary can change the solution dramatically for @xmath198 and moderate @xmath39 of @xmath200 . for these parameters",
    "the circularization radius is relatively high , @xmath201 , and the assumption that the flow is radial close to the bondi radius is not valid .",
    "our models a03f1a and a03f1b differ only in the location of the outer radial boundary , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "however , this difference produces dramatic change in the accretion flow . for model a03f1b ,",
    "the flow is non - radial even as far as the bondi radius and material with @xmath17 as low as @xmath204 turns around near the equator and never makes it through the inner boundary .",
    "since the point where this material turns is relatively far from the inner boundary , the sonic surface of the flow coming from the polar region is approximately spherical and almost as large as the sonic surface in bondi accretion with @xmath136 .",
    "_ because of these properties of the sonic surface the mass accretion rate is almost as high as the bondi rate _ !",
    "this model once again demonstrates that the mass accretion rate is determined more by the shape of the flow that does not accrete than by the angular distribution of @xmath17 at large radii . on the other hand ,",
    "model a03f1a has @xmath205 and forces the flow to be radial near the bondi radius via our outer boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the flow converges toward the equator at smaller radii and the material that goes through the inner boundary has @xmath17 higher than in the model a03f1b .",
    "additionally , the point where the material with too high @xmath17 turns around near the equator is closer to the black hole than the sonic point in the polar region .",
    "consequently , for model a03f1a the sonic surface has the ` figure-8 ' shape and the mass accretion rate is lower than the bondi rate .    because of the sensitivity of the results to the location of the outer boundary for models with @xmath199 , we do not consider these models in great detail .",
    "however , we note that these models ( with fixed @xmath22 ) show an @xmath2 @xmath206 relation very similar to the one we found for models with @xmath207 .",
    "we base most of our observations and conclusions on models with @xmath207 not only because they are computationally affordable but also because they do not depend on the location of the outer boundary . comparing models b04f1a and",
    "b04f1b we find that moving @xmath22 from @xmath208 to @xmath203 does not change the solution for the accretion flow .",
    "the reason for this is simply that , contrary to models with @xmath199 , the bondi radius is large enough compared to @xmath188 that the @xmath21 component of centrifugal force is relatively small .",
    "consequently , the radial approximation at the bondi radius is valid for models with @xmath207 .",
    "unfortunately , models with the ratio @xmath50 lower than @xmath123 are computationally too expensive to be explored as fully as models with @xmath193 .",
    "for example , it takes about three weeks of cpu time on a modern workstation to run one model with @xmath209 for 3 dynamical time scales at the bondi radius .",
    "therefore , we limited ourselves to two models with @xmath120 , model c04f1a and c08f2a . our primary goal of running these models was to check whether the mass accretion rate would change compared to models with @xmath207 .",
    "model c04f1a is meant to represent a model with a wide accretion funnel ( the second regime in the @xmath2 @xmath206 relation ) while model c08f2a is meant to represent a model with a narrow accretion funnel ( the third regime in the @xmath2 @xmath206 relation ) . for model c04f1a ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is smaller than the corresponding model with @xmath193 ( i.e. , model b04f1a , see table  1 ) but we note that the mass accretion rate was increasing with time at the end of our calculations .",
    "judging from the trend of @xmath2 with time we conclude that the mass accretion rate does not change much when the ratio @xmath50 decreases from @xmath123 to @xmath120 in the wide funnel case .",
    "we reach the same conclusion for the models in the narrow funnel case .",
    "we recognize that our conclusions are based on very limited data but they are consistent , at least for small @xmath50 , with our understanding of how the mass accretion rate is determined .",
    "this paper presents the first phase of our study of slightly rotating accretion flows onto black holes .",
    "we decided to consider a far simpler case of an accretion flow than those occurring in nature .",
    "in particular , we neglected the gravitational field due to the host galaxy , radiative heating and cooling , viscosity and mhd effects .",
    "perhaps the most important simplification we made is neglecting the transport of energy and angular momentum outward as needed to accrete matter with a specific angular momentum higher than @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , our results provide a useful exploratory study of accretion onto black holes as they have revealed unexpected properties and complexity of accretion flows in even this simple case . clearly , a lot more work is needed to give a definitive answer to the question of whether slow rotation of gas at large radii is really enough to reduce the mass accretion rate to the level required by observations . in what follows",
    "we will summarize our results , briefly review the limitations of our work , and discuss how the physical effects neglected here may change the results .",
    "we have performed numerical 2d , axisymmetric , hydrodynamical simulations of slightly rotating , inviscid accretion flows onto a black hole .",
    "we attempt to mimic the boundary conditions of classic bondi accretion flows with the only modifications being the introduction of a small , latitude - dependent angular momentum at the outer boundary and a pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "the distribution of @xmath17 with latitude allows the density distribution at infinity to approach spherical symmetry .",
    "the main result of our calculations is that the properties of the accretion flow do not depend as much on the outer boundary conditions ( i.e. , the amount as well as distribution of the angular momentum ) as on the geometry of the _ non - accreting matter_. additionally , we find that the mass accretion rate @xmath24 angular momentum relation for a given angular distribution of @xmath17 has three regimes : ( i ) for low @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath45 for all @xmath21 at large radii ) , a torus does not form and @xmath46 , ( ii ) for intermediate @xmath17 , or more appropriately where there is a narrow range of @xmath21 for which @xmath47 so that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and ( iii ) for high @xmath17 , or in the case for which @xmath51 at nearly all @xmath21 so that @xmath52 , @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "our limited data suggest that in the second regime , the actual value of the constant is dependent on the ratio @xmath50 for large @xmath50 but becomes independent on the ratio for small @xmath50 ( i.e. , for @xmath210 ) .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of even slow rotational motion of the inviscid flow at large radii can significantly reduce @xmath2 compared to the bondi rate , as the @xmath2 @xmath24 @xmath17 relation in the third regime indicates . for @xmath211 ,",
    "our results show that @xmath2 can be reduced by @xmath212 orders of magnitude compared to the bondi rate . to reduce the mass accretion rate more , the accretion funnel needs to be much narrower than the funnels allowed by our assumption of low angular momentum ( eq .",
    "27 ) for @xmath211 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether simulations for values of @xmath50 as low as those observed in astrophysical systems ( i.e. , @xmath213 ) will confirm our predictions that the accretion funnel can be very narrow and subsequently the mass accretion rate very small .",
    "we note that the discontinuous change from quasi - spherical to a disk - like flow was first found by abramowicz & zurek ( 1981 ) .",
    "abramowicz & zurek studied analytically the adiabatic accretion of a radial flow onto a black hole using the pw potential .",
    "they considered the case of constant specific angular momentum and also found that for small @xmath17 , the flow is quasi - spherical and becomes transonic at @xmath214 while for sufficiently large @xmath17 , the flow has a disk - like pattern and @xmath215 . applying abramowicz & zurek s solution for the sonic point",
    ", we find very good agreement between the location of the sonic point on the equator and their prediction .",
    "in particular , for @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and zero total energy , eq . 3.5 in abramowicz & zurek ( 1981 ) yields that the sonic point equals @xmath218 , which is in a good agreement with our result for @xmath27 where the sonic radius is @xmath219 ( e.g. , see figure  4 ) .",
    "our simulations also agree with abramowicz & zurek s result that the transition between quasi - spherical and disk - like accretion occurs at @xmath220 .",
    "we find that the shape of the polar funnel through which matter is accreted is partially constrained by the torus , which is made of matter that can not accrete .",
    "the torus consists of material with roughly uniform angular momentum and its structure does not depend much on the outer conditions .",
    "the accretion funnel is therefore also not very sensitive to the outer conditions in the limit that it is broad at large radii ( i.e. , large @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is the key reason for the insensitivity of @xmath2 to @xmath17 in the second regime and its weak sensitivity in the third regime : the mass accretion rate depends on the geometry of the sonic surface at radii where the presence of the torus is important , and not only on the geometry at the outer boundary .",
    "thus , the accretion flow in the funnel should depend on the physics that controls the flow in the torus .",
    "in particular , the introduction of energy dissipation , and the transport of energy and angular momentum in the torus , may change the shape of the torus and its effect on the polar regions , where material can accrete without the transport of angular momentum .",
    "one could argue that the total mass accretion rate ( via both the funnel and torus ) onto the black hole should increase when transport of angular momentum and consequently accretion via the torus are allowed .",
    "however , it is not clear by how much @xmath2 will increase , if at all , because the energy and angular momentum from the torus are likely to be deposited in the polar region ( see e.g. , stone , pringle & begelman 1999 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; blandford & begelman 2002a , 2002b ; hawley & balbus 2002 ) . indeed ,",
    "outflow from the torus may interfere with the inflow in the funnel and @xmath2 may well _ decrease_. there is also a possibility that accretion via the funnel will decrease , not because of the dynamical effects due to outflowing material but because a torus in which energy is dissipated should be hotter and thicker than a torus in which energy can not be dissipated . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear how accretion via the torus will change when supersonic accretion in the funnel is present .",
    "our simulations show that the range of @xmath21 that is occupied by the accretion funnel increases with decreasing distance from the black hole .",
    "in particular , accretion through the inner radius occurs for the entire range of @xmath21 .",
    "we expect that the presence of a supersonic accretion flow near the equator at small radii may cause accretion via the torus to be less effective compared to the situation in which the material in the polar region is static .",
    "most simulations of the formation of the torus have assumed that the material near the poles , outside the initially hydrostatic rotating torus , is static or subsonic , and therefore unimportant dynamically .    even within our simple framework of inviscid flow",
    ", we anticipate that our results may change if we relax some of our assumptions about the geometry at the outer boundary .",
    "the assumptions we adopted are as simple as possible because we do not know the magnitude of the angular momentum of material in the environment of smbhs , nor the angular distribution of @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , it is rather unlikely that the @xmath17 distribution is axisymmetric .",
    "therefore , fully 3d calculations are required to explore how @xmath2 responds to non - axisymmetric @xmath17 distributions . in the context of inviscid hd calculations similar to ours",
    ", one would expect that 3d effects may reduce @xmath2 compared to 2d axisymmetric calculations .",
    "for example , it is possible that rotation at large radii occurs not just around one axis but around two or more axes .",
    "it is also possible that rotation occurs around an axis that changes with @xmath124 .",
    "additionally it is plausible that there are `` winds '' flowing past the smbh or that the entropy in the smbh environment is variable .",
    "in such a case , material with too high @xmath17 to be accreted may occupy nearly the entire range of @xmath21 at small radii ( near or inside the sonic radius ) and prevent low-@xmath17 material from accreting . in terms of accretion",
    "funnels , this would correspond to the situation in which the ` funnel ' is very narrow and maybe not lined up with a radial vector .",
    "perhaps the best studied massive black hole with a very low luminosity is the black hole in the galactic center .",
    "many models and ideas for how to explain very low smbh luminosities have been explored in the context of sgr  @xmath221 . in particular ,",
    "melia ( 1992 ; 1994 ) proposed a spherical accretion model in which the accretion flow is assumed to be in free - fall until a keplerian disk is formed within a small circularization radius .",
    "coker & melia ( 2000 ) looked at the problem of spherical accretion but with the magnetic field being in subequipartition .",
    "the latter results in a reduced bremsstrahlung emissivity and can help to explain the low luminosity of sgr  @xmath221 .",
    "a relatively small distance to sgr  @xmath221 allows us to map the vicinity of the black hole at the galactic center .",
