    "<S> to estimate @xmath1 , we relax the requirement of incompressibility and compute the change in free energy under a uniform change in the radius of the droplet . </S>",

    "<S> we then find @xmath56    as we shall see below , @xmath17 does indeed take this form in the limit of large @xmath57 </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eigen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general problem of the change in the spectrum of the laplacian under a boundary perturbation was considered some time ago and appears in a number of contexts , such as acoustics in or around irregular regions , cavity resonators , and the wigner - seitz approximation for electrons in a crystal ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the early work on this problem focused on the solution to first order in the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we require the result to second order ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , which is substantially more difficult to determine . in @xcite </S>",

    "<S> ( [ largel ] ) .    as discussed above , the @xmath67 mode is constrained by incompressibility and the @xmath68 modes correspond to translations ( which implies @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the leading contribution in the small-@xmath57 or long - wavelength limit comes from @xmath70 : @xmath71    we thus find that for @xmath41 , the surface free energy picks up a contribution from the polymer which does not appear to have a simple interpretation in terms of surface elasticity and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the lowest modes , this contribution to the surface energy can be quite important . </S>",
    "<S> for the experiments in @xcite , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . with these values , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the ( @xmath70 ) polymer contribution to the free energy to the bending contribution is @xmath75 ; the contributions from bending energy and the polymer are comparable .    in the calculations above </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected self - avoidance . however , in the limit of very high compressions self - avoidance will certainly be important . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is bounded from below by @xmath76 , the radius for which the polymer volume fraction is equal to one . near this limit </S>",
    "<S> , we expect the interior of the droplet to be similar to a melt . </S>",
    "<S> the screening length @xmath0 @xcite is then microscopic and the polymer free energy is insensitive to the shape of the droplet : @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the polymer to make a significant contribution to the surface free energy , the droplet radius must be in the range @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for droplets within this range , self avoidance will be important for the lowest modes . </S>",
    "<S> a simple scaling estimate of @xmath0 @xcite gives @xmath79 where @xmath80 . for a chain in a good solvent , @xmath81 , and in a theta solvent , @xmath82 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even for a modest compression of the polymer ( @xmath83 ) , the screening length is comparable to @xmath9 ( @xmath84 ) and the lowest modes of the droplet are just at the wavelengths where screening becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> while this results in a suppression of the free energy of the lowest modes , we can not gauge the size of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not know whether this suppression is strong enough to significantly reduce the polymer contribution to the surface energy relative to the bending energy .    </S>",
    "<S> even for the higher modes , for which screening is unimportant ( i.e. @xmath85 ) , there will be corrections due to self - avoidance . </S>",
    "<S> we can again use a scaling argument to estimate the free energy of a polymer in a spherical droplet ( with @xmath48 ) : @xmath86 ignoring numerical factors , the above estimate is smaller than the ideal polymer result , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fsph ] ) , by a factor of @xmath87 . following the arguments leading to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ largel ] ) , we then expect the large-@xmath57 behavior of @xmath65 to be smaller by a factor of @xmath88 for a polymer in a good solvent ; there is no correction for a polymer in a theta solvent .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have determined the contribution to the surface free energy arising from confining an ideal polymer within a droplet . </S>",
    "<S> not surprisingly , this contribution does not have a simple interpretation in terms of two - dimensional elasticity and geometry . using parameters appropriate for polymers confined in microemulsions @xcite , we find that the bending and polymer terms in the surface energy are comparable for the lowest modes . </S>",
    "<S> scaling arguments suggest that chain self - avoidance will tend to decrease the magnitude of the polymer contribution .    _ </S>",
