    "while the composition is known to be a key to understanding the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays its determination by air shower experiments is a challenge ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "estimations of the primary mass based on observables such as the depth of shower maximum @xmath1 , particle arrival times or muon content suffer from significant uncertainties in the description of high - energy hadronic interactions . in this paper",
    "we show that the exponential slope , @xmath0 , of the tail of the @xmath1distribution can be used for the determination of the proton - to - helium ratio , @xmath2 , in the primary beam and that @xmath0 and the inferred @xmath2are only weakly dependent on details of hadronic interactions and experimental systematic uncertainties .",
    "thus , even with the indirect observations performed by air shower experiments it becomes possible to obtain a robust measure of an important detail of the cosmic ray composition .",
    "knowledge of @xmath2can be used to constrain astrophysical models of the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "the exponential slope @xmath0 of the tail of the @xmath3 distribution was extensively studied and used with respect to the determination of the proton - air interaction cross - section in an energy region where the primary composition appears proton - dominated ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the tail of the @xmath1distribution is intimately linked to the interaction cross - section of the first interaction .",
    "one possible choice by such measurements was to define the fit range so that it would contain 20% of the deepest events",
    "the contamination of the primary beam with photons and helium nuclei was the main source of the systematic uncertainties on the proton - air cross - section . in the present work",
    "this sensitivity of @xmath0 to the primary mass composition is the very subject of the study .",
    "we define @xmath0 in a different way , using a pre - defined fit range satisfying the condition to be almost free from the contamination of nuclei heavier than helium .",
    "this makes @xmath0 sensitive predominantly to @xmath2 in the primary beam and provides a possibility for estimating @xmath2 in air shower experiments .",
    "current best constraints on @xmath2at ultra - high energies @xmath4  ev can be deduced using the hadronic interaction models epos - lhc  @xcite and qgsjet - ii.04  @xcite from mass composition fits of full @xmath1distributions measured at the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "since the covariance matrices for the fitted nuclei fractions are not available an estimation of the upper limits on @xmath2from this data with account of systematic and statistical uncertainties can be done by taking the upper value of the proton fraction @xmath5 and dividing it by the lower value of the helium fraction @xmath6 ( for the lower limits on @xmath2one has @xmath7 ) . for the energy range @xmath8 where the fits indicate the presence of a large fraction of protons and in case of epos - lhc a very low fraction of helium , one gets @xmath9 and @xmath10 . even when comparing just these two post - lhc event generators , the central values of @xmath2differ by around a factor 10 . taking into account the uncertainties it is possible to set only a lower limit @xmath11 . for higher energies",
    "@xmath12 the corresponding values @xmath13 and @xmath14 cover a range from helium dominance to helium being almost absent .",
    "these uncertainties may get even larger when other hadronic models will be used , like the new version of sibyll  @xcite producing showers with deeper @xmath1compared qgsjet - ii.04 and epos - lhc .",
    "the @xmath0 method proposed in this paper can considerably improve the ability to determine @xmath2 .",
    "the slope @xmath0 is weakly sensitive to the variations of @xmath1distribution properties ( mean @xmath15 and width @xmath16 ) which are influenced by shower development and fluctuations and drive the fits to the full @xmath1distributions , and thus to ( i ) variations of hadronic interaction parameters other than the cross - section and to ( ii ) the systematic uncertainties on @xmath1and energy , as will be discussed below .",
    "the use of @xmath0 is hence expected to provide better and more robust constraints on @xmath2compared to fitting of the full @xmath1distributions .",
    "due to our definition of the @xmath1fit range , the fraction of events in the fit range becomes a primary mass sensitive parameter itself .",
    "we show that this fraction can be useful for additionally constraining the abundances of nuclei heavier than helium . having introduced more variables in addition to a number of existing ones based on @xmath1 , muon content and related observables ( signal risetime , radius of curvature etc . )",
    ", one would like to compare their performance for mass composition analysis in particular with respect to uncertainties from modeling hadronic interactions .",
    "we propose to use the ratio @xmath17 of the difference between proton and helium for some variable @xmath18 to the uncertainties @xmath19 on this variable due to the limited knowledge of hadronic interaction properties .",
    "we call this ratio an ` analysis indicator ' .",
    "the analysis indicator for the exponential slope @xmath0 turns out to be significantly larger than for other mass - sensitive variables such as @xmath15 or average number of muons .",
    "all simulations are performed with conex  @xcite for the hadronic interaction models epos - lhc and qgsjet - ii.04 . for each primary particle type ( proton , helium , carbon , iron ) and energy ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) around @xmath22",
    "showers are produced . to imitate the detector resolution effect ,",
    "each @xmath1value is smeared by adding a gaussian distributed random variable with @xmath23  @xmath24 , a typical value for current shower experiments using the fluorescence technique  @xcite .",
    "in addition to showers with fixed energies , we simulated @xmath25 epos - lhc proton showers from an energy spectrum with @xmath26 in the energy range @xmath27 to confirm that a typical energy distribution does not affect the determination of the value of @xmath0 due to its weak energy dependence and that the simulations for fixed energies provide the necessary precision .",
    "a main feature of our approach is the definition of the fit range , given a measured @xmath1distribution . in the cross - section analysis , where the fit range is determined by requiring it to contain the deepest @xmath28 of events , for a simplified example of a pure carbon composition one will get @xmath29 corresponding to the carbon - air cross - section . for",
    "mixed compositions @xmath29 takes values from the spectrum of possibilities from proton to heavier nuclei and intermediate values are degenerate , i.e. the same value of @xmath29 corresponds to a number of different mixed compositions .",
    "instead , we define a lower limit of the @xmath1fit range using the requirement that only @xmath30 of the carbon - initiated showers survive . this way , a very small contamination from nuclei heavier than helium can be achieved . in this paper",
    "we use the lower limit value originating from qgsjet - ii.04 which is @xmath31  @xmath24  larger compared to the corresponding value for epos - lhc ( thus the fraction of the surviving carbon showers for epos - lhc is slightly below 0.5% )",
    ". the lower limit of the fit range defined this way is @xmath32  @xmath24 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 change within @xmath33  @xmath24  when the width of the fit range is varied within @xmath34  @xmath24 , further we use a width of @xmath35  @xmath24 . for application to data the width",
    "could possibly be further optimized depending on the characteristics of the specific experiment and the available number of events .",
    "due to our definition , in case of a composition devoid of protons and helium ( such as the example of a pure carbon composition ) there will be too few events in the fit range to get a statistically reliable estimation of @xmath0 ( the usage of the fraction of events in the fit range for composition studies is inspected in sec .",
    "3 ) . for mixed compositions ,",
    "@xmath0 in our method is sensitive mainly to the relative abundances of protons and helium in the primary beam , and would take values between the @xmath0 values for pure proton and pure helium as will be shown below .    in fig .",

    "this difference is much larger than the difference of @xmath39  @xmath24due to the hadronic model uncertainties , indicating an excellent suitability of the @xmath0 method for mass composition analysis with only a minor dependence on details of the hadronic interaction models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phe ] we show the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2for two - component mixtures .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath2is possible in a range @xmath40 where @xmath0 and @xmath2are strongly correlated . outside this range limits @xmath41 or @xmath42 can be set .",
    "next , we investigate the impact of primary nuclei heavier than helium .",
    "we focus here on adding carbon ( @xmath43 ) and note that the effect of even heavier nuclei such as oxygen or iron is smaller than that of carbon . in fig .",

    "specifically , a contamination with carbon of even 50% leads to a shift of @xmath0 of @xmath44  @xmath24only . a determination of @xmath0 with an uncertainty of few @xmath24  ( e.g. for samples of 5000 events in total , the relative statistical uncertainty is @xmath45 , c.f .",

    "for example , the smearing with a gaussian distributed random variable with @xmath23  @xmath24that we apply to the conex @xmath1values , changes @xmath0 within 1.5  @xmath24 . the systematic uncertainty on @xmath1reported by the auger observatory  @xcite is smaller than 10  @xmath24 .",
    "shifts of the simulated @xmath1values by @xmath46  @xmath24produce changes in the values of @xmath0 within @xmath47  @xmath24 .",

    "it is worth noting that special care has to be taken to achieve an unbiased data set and , thus , an unbiased extraction of @xmath0 .",

    "any data points in the area above the proton - only value of @xmath0 or to the right of the proton - helium line would serve as an indication of shortcomings in the particular interaction model .",
    "compared to the fraction of events in the fit range , @xmath0 is a more robust variable with respect to the uncertainties in the interaction models , being sensitive essentially to the cross - section only .",
    "the fraction of events in the fit range is influenced both by the position of the shower maximum and by the width of the @xmath61 distributions .",

    "denoting for some variable @xmath18 the uncertainty due to the hadronic ( h ) interaction models as @xmath19 and the difference between values of @xmath18 for protons and helium as @xmath66 one can define the following quantity :    @xmath67    we propose to name it ` analysis indicator ' : values @xmath68 ( that is , @xmath69 ) indicate that @xmath18 is excellent for mass composition ( label ` @xmath70 ' in @xmath71 ) analysis , while for @xmath72 the variable is good for constraining interaction models ( label ` h ' ) .",

    "let us consider several examples .",
    "the depth of the shower maximum is known as a good shower observable for estimating the mass composition .",

    "an opposite example can be given by variables related to the muon shower content .",
    "for the muon production depth  @xcite the analysis indicator is is obtained using @xmath76 @xmath77/50~[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-2}}}\\xspace}]=0.5.$ ] similarly for the number of muons in very inclined air showers is the ratio of the total number of muons in simulations or data to a number of muons in a typical proton shower at 10  eev produced with qgsjet - ii.03 ] @xmath78  @xcite one gets @xmath79 uncertainties on these variables from the description of hadronic interactions are limiting their usage for composition analysis .",
    "results on @xmath80from @xmath78 and @xmath81 leading to masses heavier than iron  @xcite may be used to restrict interaction models .",
    "for @xmath0 the uncertainties due to interaction models are small @xmath39  @xmath24  and the difference between protons and helium is around @xmath82  @xmath24(fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] ) , thus @xmath83 . allowing for an uncertainty ( statistical and systematic ) of approximately 10% on the proton - air cross - section  @xcite which corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath84 on @xmath0 , the analysis indicator is still large @xmath85/6~[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-2}}}\\xspace}]\\approx3.3 $ ] .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath0 method is suitable for differentiating between primaries even as close as proton and helium .    for the fraction of events in the fit range",
    "the analysis indicator is @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fractions ] ) which is clearly smaller compared to @xmath87 but still indicates a good applicability for composition studies .",
    "we introduced a method to determine @xmath2 in primary cosmic rays at ultra - high - energies from the slope of the exponential fit of the tail of the @xmath1distribution .",
    "the method is robust with regard to a possible contamination of the primary beam with nuclei heavier than helium , to experimental systematic uncertainties on @xmath1and energy , and ",
    "importantly  to uncertainties in hadronic models being sensitive mainly to the interaction cross - section . a solid determination of @xmath2with air shower experiments will be a remarkable achievement .",
    "the fraction of events in the fit range is proposed as an additional mass sensitive variable that can be used to constrain the abundance of nuclei heavier than helium in the primary beam .    as explained in the introduction , for the determination of @xmath2the use of the full @xmath88 distribution to fit the cosmic ray composition",
    "is not superior or equivalent to the @xmath0 method presented here which exploits only the tail of the distribution .",
    "this can be understood because the absolute @xmath1values ( and related @xmath15 ) do not have such a direct relation to the primary @xmath2as has @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the absolute @xmath1values is much stronger affected by experimental systematics e.g. in @xmath1 , by the ( uncertain ) presence of heavier nuclei , and , in particular , by hadronic model uncertainties ( @xmath89 ) . since , however , the absolute @xmath1values are a main driver when fitting the full @xmath1distribution , the primary @xmath2from elemental fractions derived this way suffers from larger uncertainty compared to exploiting the direct correlation between @xmath0 and primary @xmath2 .",
    "while the @xmath0 method provides only partial but not full information on composition such as abundances of all elements or mass groups ( as fitting the full @xmath1distribution does ) , it focuses on that part of the data which allows us to draw robust conclusions about the mass composition , even if the price to pay is to determine only one of its specific aspects , namely in this case @xmath2 .    in the paper on proton - air cross - section measurement by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite the fit of @xmath28 of the deepest events with energies @xmath90 gave @xmath91  @xmath24 . a naive , straightforward comparison of this value with the values found in the current paper ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phe ] ) indicates that protons are indeed existing and are more abundant than helium nuclei at these energies , in agreement with the estimations of  @xcite .",
    "however , such a comparison should be taken with great care .",
    "the fit range in the cross - section analysis ( both the starting depth and the width ) differs from the definition in the current work , optimized for @xmath2determination .",
    "such a difference will result in a different data sample for the @xmath2analysis compared to the data sample used for the cross - section analysis . as",
    "a result the value of @xmath29 might differ as well both due to an earlier start of the fit ( closer to the maximum of the @xmath1distribution ) and due to a possible larger contamination with nuclei heavier than helium .",
    "thus for a quantitative interpretation of data a proper accounting for detector acceptance , event selection criteria and definition of the fit range is needed .    in the method proposed in the current paper ,",
    "an important characteristic we exploit is the quasi - discreteness of light nuclei ( @xmath92 ) in the cosmic ray beam with protons and helium being the dominating light primary particles .",
    "other light nuclei are not expected to significantly impact the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the primary abundance of the other light nuclei is expected to be very small due to their relative instability compared to protons and helium . as confirmed by simulations of cosmic ray propagation with crpropa  @xcite ,",
    "their primary abundance is suppressed by factors @xmath93 compared to the abundance of ( @xmath94 )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , elements heavier than helium are additionally suppressed by our definition of the @xmath1fit range . for instance , suppression factors due to the fit range relative to protons ( to helium ) are about 8 ( 2.5 ) for @xmath95li and 20 ( 6 ) for @xmath96b .",
    "finally , we also introduced a new quantity called ` analysis indicator ' for the characterization of the performance of the mass - sensitive variables for mass composition analysis .",
    "the value of the analysis indicator for @xmath0 is at least twice as large as that for @xmath15 . compared to @xmath15 or to an analysis making use of absolute @xmath1values",
    ", @xmath0 is more robust with regard to experimental systematic uncertainties and to uncertainties in the simulation of hadronic interactions since it depends essentially only on the cross - section .",
    "though the fraction of events in the fit range is more sensitive to hadronic interaction parameters compared to @xmath0 , it still has a value of the analysis indicator comparable to that for @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis indicator can provide a common base for comparing performances of the different mass - sensitive variables for mass composition analysis or for constraining hadronic interactions .",
