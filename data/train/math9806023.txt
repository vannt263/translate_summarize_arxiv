    "these quantum invariants are speculated to generalize to higher dimensions .",
    "such putative invariants have their origins in a theory of quantum gravity @xcite and higher categories @xcite . in relation to the current work",
    ", the following progress has been made .",
    "quantum spin networks were generalized by crane - yetter @xcite to give @xmath0-manifold invariants that were based on ooguri s proposal @xcite .",
    "the invariants can be used to compute the signature as shown in @xcite .",
    "birmingham - rakowski @xcite generalized the dijkgraaf - witten @xcite invariant of 3-manifolds , defined by group 3-cocycles , to triangulated 4-manifolds using pairs of cocycles .",
    "crane and frenkel @xcite constructed hopf categories to define 4-manifold invariants , and they gave examples using canonical bases of quantum groups . in @xcite crane and yetter used cocycles to construct hopf categories .    in this paper",
    "we provide direct relations between the cocycle conditions of @xcite and pachner moves of @xmath0-manifolds , thus constructing a generalization of the dijkgraaf - witten invariants to dimension 4 .",
    "the relations are established diagrammatically , providing connections between hopf categorical structures and triangulations via dual graphs and their movies .",
    "the current paper is self - contained , but the reader might enjoy our introduction to the subject given in @xcite , where many of our ideas and motivations are introduced in a more leisurely fashion .",
    "for the diagrammatic foundation of the invariants in dimension 3 see , @xcite , and . for the algebraic approach",
    "see @xcite .",
    "finally , there is a relation to higher dimensional knot theory as found in @xcite .",
    "let us continue our motivational remarks . in @xmath1 dimensions",
    ", planar diagrams played a key role in the definitions of both knot invariants and manifold invariants .",
    "such diagrams are convenient since they help one grasp the categorical and algebraic structures needed for defining invariants .",
    "one of the difficulties in generalizing to dimension @xmath0 or higher is the lack of such visualizations and diagrammatic machinery .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide basic diagrammatic tools to study @xmath0-manifold triangulations , and to use such formulations to define invariants .",
    "in particular , we formulate the crane - frenkel approach in terms of cocycles as initial data and prove the invariance under pachner moves in a diagrammatic way .",
    "we introduce spin networks for the study of such invariants .",
    "we hope that the present work serves as a basic tool in exploring the possibilities in higher dimensions .",
    "there is a close relationship bewteen certain physical models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory and the formulation of `` quantum '' invariants of knots , links and three - manifolds .",
    "we hope that this relationship continues into dimension four .",
    "in particular , one can hope that a four dimensional toplogical field theory ( such as we study here ) would be related to the calculation of amplitudes in quantum gravity .",
    "the naive reason for this hope is quite simple : an amplitude for quantum gravity must sum over the possible metrics on the four - dimensional spacetime . averaging over metrics",
    "should in priniciple produce basic numbers that are metric - independent . in other words",
    "a valid process of averaging over metrics should produce topological invariants of the underlying four - space .",
    "of course on the physical side it will be neccessary to extricate the topological part from the complexities of the model .",
    "on the pure mathematical side it will be neccessary to see the relevance of the mathematics .",
    "nevertheless this hope for an application to quantum gravity is one of the forces that drives our project .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",

    "they provide the basic machinery necessary to define other invariants defined via hopf categories .",

    "this shows that the hopf algebra structure gives solutions to the equation corresponding to the cone move .    that the partition function in this case does not depend on the choice of triangulation",
    "is proved by showing that the pachner moves follow from the cone move and other singular moves .",
    "figure  [ chfs ] explains why the @xmath42-move follows from singular moves ( this figure is basically the same as a figure in @xcite ) .",
    "let us explain the figure .",
    "the first polyhedron is the right - hand - side of the @xmath42-move .",
    "there are three internal faces and three tetrahedra .",
    "perform the cone move along edge @xmath43 thereby duplicating face @xmath44 .",
    "internally , we have face @xmath44 glued to face @xmath33 along edge @xmath43 and face @xmath45 glued to face @xmath46 along edge @xmath47 .",

    "these faces can be replaced by four faces parallel to four faces on the boundary ; @xmath36 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this is the configuration in the third polyhedron .",
    "then there are two @xmath1-cells bounded by these parallel faces .",
    "collapse these cells and push the internal faces onto the boundary ( this is done by singular moves ) .",
    "the result is the fourth polytope which now is a single polytope without any internal faces .",
    "this is the middle stage in the sense that we have proved that the right - hand - side of the @xmath42-move is in fact equivalent to this polytope .",
    "now introduce a pair of internal faces parallel to the faces @xmath48 and @xmath50 to get the fifth polytope ( the left bottom one ) .",
    "perform associativity again to change it to a pair of faces @xmath51 and @xmath52 to get the sixth polytope .",

    "we give a generalization of this theorem to dimension @xmath0 in lemmas  [ pac33 ] , [ pac24 ] , and [ pac15 ] .",
    "* dijkgraaf - witten invariants . *    * summary : going up dimensions . *",
    "in section  [ pac23 ] we reviewed the pachner moves for triangulations in dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath1 and their relations to associativity of algebras . in this section , we describe pachner moves in dimension @xmath0 .",
    "relations of these moves to the stasheff polytope was discussed in @xcite .    in general , an @xmath57-dimensional pachner move of type @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , is obtained by decomposing the ( spherical ) boundary of an @xmath60-simplex into the union of two @xmath57-balls such that one of the balls is the union of @xmath61 @xmath57-simplices , the other ball is the union of @xmath62 @xmath57-simplices , and the intersection of these balls is an @xmath63-sphere . by labeling the vertices of the @xmath60-simplex",
    "these moves are easily expressed .",
    "for example , the table below indicates the lower dimensional pachner moves :    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the cone move to @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( which is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ tacolem5 ] ) followed by the pillow move to @xmath66 and @xmath67 collapses @xmath68 to @xmath69 as claimed .",
    "thus we get two polytopes @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "next perform a pachner move to @xmath72 which shares @xmath73 . as a result",
    "we get three new tetrahedra @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75-move is illustrated in fig .",

    "hence we now can collapse @xmath84 to the tetrahedra @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 in the same manner as we did to @xmath68 .",
    "the collapsing is indicated in fig .",
    "[ tacolem7 ] .",
    "the result is a single polytope @xmath88 resulted from @xmath76 which has the same boundary tetrahedra as those of the left hand side of the 4-dimensional pachner move .",
    "figure  [ tacolem7 ] indicates the resulting polytope at the bottom of the figure . in fig .",
    "[ tacolem8 ] the 3-dimensional boundary is illustrated .",
    "notice the following : ( 1 ) triangle ( ace ) is no longer present ; ( 2 ) among the nine tetrahedra illustrated , neither triangle @xmath89 nor triangle @xmath90 appears ; ( 3 ) these are all of the tetrahedral faces of the 5 simplex that contain neither @xmath89 nor @xmath90 .",
    "thus we can apply the same method starting with @xmath90 to get to this polytope .",

    "thus the pillow moves will collapse @xmath100 and @xmath99 .",

    "* remark . * in @xcite crane and frenkel proposed constructions of @xmath0-manifold quantum invariants using hopf categories .",
    "hopf categories generalize the definition of hopf algebra to a categorical setting in the same way that modular categories generalize modules .",

    "they showed that this condition corresponds to the cone move .",
    "thus lemmas in this section can be used to prove the well - definedness of invariants they proposed by showing that their definition is invariant under pachner moves .",
