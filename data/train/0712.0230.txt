    "despite the outstanding role that angular variables play in physics , their proper definition in quantum mechanics is beset by difficulties and requires more care than perhaps might be expected  @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , the simple example of a particle moving on a circle of unit radius : the problems essentially arise then from the periodicity , which prevents the existence of a well - behaved angle operator , but not of its complex exponential , we shall denote by @xmath0 .    in quantum optics",
    ", this topic is by no means purely academic : it turns out to be crucial for a proper understanding of , e.g. , the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as put forward by allen and coworkers  @xcite , the laguerre - gauss modes , typical of cylindrical symmetry , carry a well - defined oam per photon .",
    "since it is surprisingly simple to generate , control , filter , and detect oam states of light experimentally , researchers have begun to appreciate their practical potential for classical  @xcite and quantum information applications  @xcite .",
    "intimately linked to the issue of a proper angle description it is the question of the associated uncertainty relations .",
    "surprisingly enough , some subtle aspects of these relations still remains under discussion . from previous work in this topic",
    "@xcite it seems clear that , if one insists in holding to an angle operator , special care must be taken when using the standard variance , since this is a nonperiodic measure of spread that makes the angular uncertainty depend on the @xmath1 window chosen .",
    "moreover , the associated commutation relation depends on the value of the angle distribution at a point , which turns it of somewhat cumbersome handling .    by precise measurements on a light beam",
    ", a detailed test of the uncertainty principle for angle and angular momentum has been recently demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to pass the beam through an angular aperture and measure the resulting angular - momentum distribution  @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "we have presented experimental results  @xcite that strengthen the evidence that @xmath0 furnishes a correct description of angular phenomena .",
    "when a sensible periodic resolution measure ( namely , the circular variance ) is employed , the associated intelligent states should minimize two inequalities ( one for the cosine and other for the sine ) , and both can not be saturated simultaneously . to bypass this drawback ,",
    "we have looked at the more physically meaningful notion of constrained intelligent states ; that is , states that minimize the uncertainty product for a given spread either in angle or in angular momentum .",
    "in fact , they prove to be mathieu wave functions , which have been attracting great interest in relation with nondiffracting optical fields  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we go one step beyond and present an improved experimental setup ( that uses computer - controlled spatial light modulators both at the state preparation and analyzing stages ) to verify in great detail the properties of these constrained intelligent states . as a byproduct",
    ", we also bring out that @xmath2 can be associated with a feasible transformation ( a fork - like hologram ) that shifts the values of the angular momentum .",
    "our formulation paves thus the way for a full quantum processing of vortex beams and provides a bridge between the classical theory of singular optics and the realm of quantum optics .",

    "we consider rotations of angle @xmath3 generated by the angular momentum along the @xmath4 axis , which for the simplicity we shall denote henceforth as @xmath5 .",
    "classically , a point particle is necessarily located at a single value of the periodic coordinate @xmath3 , defined within a chosen window , e.g. , @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding quantum wave function , however , is an object extended around the unit circle @xmath7 and so can be directly affected by the nontrivial topology .",
    "if we treat @xmath3 as a continuous variable , the poisson bracket for the angle and the angular momentum is @xmath8 direct application of the correspondence between poisson brackets and commutators , suggests the commutation relation ( in units @xmath9 ) @xmath10 = i \\ , .\\ ] ] one is tempted to interpret @xmath11 as multiplication by @xmath3 , and then to represent @xmath12 by the differential operator @xmath13 that verifies the fundamental relation ( [ ccr ] ) .",
    "however , the use of this operator may entail many pitfalls for the unwary : single - valuedness restricts the hilbert space to the subspace of @xmath1-periodic functions , which , among other things , rules out the angle coordinate as a _ bona fide",
    "_ observable  @xcite .",
    "a possible solution , proposed by judge and lewis  @xcite , is to modify the angle operator so that it corresponds to multiplication by @xmath3 plus a series of step functions that sharply change the angle by @xmath14 at appropriate points , which coincides with the classical poisson bracket of @xmath5 and a periodic variable .",
    "many of these difficulties can be avoided by simply selecting instead angular coordinates that are both periodic and continuous . however , a single such quantity can not uniquely specify a point on the circle because periodicity implies extrema , which excludes a one - to - one correspondence and hence is incompatible with uniqueness . perhaps the simplest choice  @xcite is to adopt two angular coordinates , such as , e. g. , cosine and sine . in classical mechanics",
    "this is indeed of a good definition , while in quantum mechanics one would have to show that these variables , we shall denote by @xmath15 and @xmath16 to make no further assumptions about the angle itself , form a complete set of commuting operators .",

    "there is a twofold goal in the theory of angular momentum and its conjugate variable : to characterize them either as a transformation or as a measurement .",
    "notice that the pioneering work in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite anticipated the former interpretation .",
    "the role of @xmath0 as a transformation is determined by the action on the basis states  ( [ e ] ) .",
    "what deserves to be explained is the possible measurement associated with @xmath0 .",
    "although the vectors @xmath28 provide an adequate description of angle , one must take into account that realistic measurements are always imprecise .",
    "in particular , the measurement of the spectrum would require infinite energy .",
    "in other words , the mathematical continuum of angles will be observed always with a finite resolution . in consequence , it could be interesting to extend the previous formalism by including fuzzy , unsharp or noisy generalizations of the ideal description provided by @xmath0 . to this end we shall use positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) , that are a set of linear operators @xmath29 furnishing the correct probabilities in any measurement process through the fundamental postulate that  @xcite @xmath30 \\ , , \\ ] ] for any state described by the density operator @xmath31 .",
    "compatibility with the properties of ordinary probability imposes the requirements @xmath32    in addition to these basic statistical conditions , some other requisites must be imposed to ensure a meaningful description of angle as a canonically conjugate variable with respect @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt the same axiomatic approach developed previously by leonhardt _",
    "@xcite for optical phase .",
    "first , we require the shifting property @xmath33 which reflects nothing but the basic feature that an angle shifter is a angle - distribution shifter and imposes the following form for the povm  @xcite @xmath34 we must also take into account that a shift in @xmath12 should not change the phase distribution . but a shift in @xmath12 is generated by @xmath0 since , according to ( [ e ] ) , it shifts the angular momentum distribution by one step .",
    "therefore , we require as well @xmath35 which , loosely speaking , is the physical translation of the fact that angle is complementary to angular momentum .",

    ".      experience with quantum mechanics of simple systems , such as the free particle and harmonic oscillator , suggests that gaussian states can be an important tool for a better understanding of the periodic motion on a circle .",
    "even so , it is remarkable that there is no clear concise definition of the gaussian distribution on a circle and one can only find vague statements scattered through the literature .",
    "we do not want to enter here into a mathematical treatment , but rather we just try to grasp the properties that make the gaussian distribution on the line to play such a key role in physics and that we are particularly keen on retaining when constructing its circular counterpart . we itemize the most relevant ones in our view :    1 .",
    "the sum of many independent random variables tend to be distributed following a gaussian distribution .",
    "all marginal and conditional densities of a gaussian are again gaussians .",
    "the fourier transform of a gaussian is also a gaussian .",
    "4 .   the gaussian distribution maximizes the shannon entropy for a fixed value of the variance .",
    "the first property ( subject to a few general conditions ) is the central - limit theorem and explains the ubiquity of gaussians in physics : the distribution of the phenomenon under study does not have to be gaussian because its average will be .",
    "the second and third ones are responsible for the good properties than one assigns to gaussian states in quantum optics .",
    "finally , the last condition bears on the information - based approach to quantum theory , but strongly depends on the definition of entropy we adopt .    in statistics",
    "there are two distributions that have been somehow suggested for having good properties on a circle , namely @xmath44 \\ , , \\\\    & & \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{pr_wrapped }   p_{\\sigma } ( \\phi ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma }    \\sum_{k = - \\infty}^\\infty \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{1}{2 }       \\frac{(\\phi - \\mu + 2 \\pi k)^2}{\\sigma^2 } \\right ] \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the modified bessel function of first kind . the first one is known as the von mises distribution , while the second is the wrapped gaussian . by a trivial application of the poisson summation formula we can express the latter as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the third jacobi theta function  @xcite . for both distributions @xmath48 represents the main direction , while @xmath49 and @xmath50 are parameters related to the concentration  @xcite .    from the previous checklist , the wrapped gaussian satisfies properties 1 to 3 , while the von mises satisfies property 4 when the variance is replaced by its circular version ( so it represents the minimally prejudiced angle distribution , given the information constraints  @xcite )",
    "therefore , it is tempting to side with the former . additionally , the jacobi @xmath51 function is the solution of the diffusion equation on a circle with the initial state being a delta function , which is another way of defining a gaussian wave function  @xcite .",
    "however , note that if we take such a route , gaussian wave functions do not lead to gaussian probability distributions anymore ( because the square of a @xmath52 is not a @xmath52 function ) , a limitation that does not apply to the von mises .    in this respect , it is convenient to make a small detour into the question of coherent states  @xcite ( recall that for the harmonic oscillator they are precisely gaussian wave packets ) .",
    "possible definitions of coherent states for a particle on a circle have been outlined in the literature  @xcite , but they are of very mathematical nature .",
    "we prefer to adopt the ideas of rembieliski and coworkers  @xcite and construct coherent states @xmath53 as eigenstates of the operator @xmath54 so that @xmath55 where the complex number @xmath56 parametrizes the unit cylinder . note in passing that @xmath57 with @xmath58 = \\sinh(1 ) e^{2 \\hat{l}}$ ] .",
    "the projection of the vector @xmath59 onto the basis @xmath60 gives then @xmath61 while in the angular basis the corresponding expression is @xmath62 where @xmath63 .    in consequence",

    "( ii ) states with wrapped gaussian _ probability _ distribution , eq .  ; and ( iii ) coherent states with wrapped gaussian _ amplitude _ density , eq .  .",
    "nevertheless , leaving aside fundamental reasons , for computational purposes these three families have very similar angular shapes and give almost indistinguishable numerical results .",
    "therefore , sometimes we will use von mises states because of their simplicity and the possibility of obtaining analytical results .",
    "coherent states for the harmonic oscillator are also minimum uncertainty wave packets . given the analogy of @xmath64 in eq .",

    "a lengthy calculation  @xcite shows that the coherent states ( [ eq : cohstaphi ] ) obey ( [ eq : uncqp ] ) as an equality and so they are indeed minimum packets for the variables ( [ eq : qp ] ) .",
    "in fact , they are also minimum for more intricate uncertainties  @xcite . however , the problem is that , at difference of the harmonic oscillator , we do not have any clear operational prescription of how to measure the quadratures ( [ eq : qp ] ) , so they give no real physical insight into the statistical description of angle .",
    "let us then turn back to the general commutation relation ( [ ele ] ) .",
    "first , we observe that dealing with angle mean and variance in the ordinary way has drawbacks .",
    "consider , for example , a sharp angle distribution localized at the origin and the same one shifted by @xmath68 . despite the fact that the physical information they convey is the same , in the later case",
    "the variance is much bigger .",
    "since angle is periodic but variance is not , it has little meaning to consider the angle measurement itself  @xcite .    in circular statistics",
    "one usually calculates the moments of the exponential of the angle  @xcite , that are referred to as circular moments and give rise , e. g. , to a circular variance @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the probability density .",
    "it possesses all the good properties expected : it is periodic , the shifted distributions @xmath72 are characterized by the same resolution , and for sharp angle distributions it coincides with the standard variance since @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , this circular variance coincides with @xmath74 which is the natural extension of variance for unitary operators  @xcite .",

    "however , it is not difficult to prove that both inequalities can not be saturated simultaneously  @xcite .",

    "the uncertainty product of the cosine distribution in panel ( b ) is well defined and lies well above the quantum limit given by the mathieu profile . in agreement with the asymptotic analysis of the previous section",
    ", the uncertainty product for the von mises angular distribution falls very close to the optimal curve : only at intermediate angular spreads @xmath148 we see a significant deviation from the standard quantum limit , while for the truncated gaussian states the deviation is larger and shifts toward higher values of @xmath148 .",
    "the point is whether the currently available measurements have sufficient resolution to discriminate between the optimal and suboptimal states mentioned above .",
    "this question is addressed in the next two sections .",
    "the theory presented thus far can be applied to a variety of physical systems . here , we consider a particularly appealing realization of a planar rotator in terms of optical beams .",
    "light beams can carry angular momentum , which comprises spin and orbital components that are associated with polarization and helical - phase fronts , respectively .",
    "in general , the spin and orbital contributions can not be considered separately , but in the paraxial approximation both contributions can be measured and manipulated independently . we emphasize that this oam manifests at the macroscopic and single - photon levels and therefore paraxial quantum optics is the most convenient context in which to treat the oam of light as a quantum resource .    in consequence , we can leave aside the spin part and consider the simplest scalar monochromatic beam carrying oam : this is precisely a vortex beam ; i.e. , a beam whose phase varies in a corkscrew - like manner along the direction of propagation .",
    "the corresponding spatial amplitude can be written as @xmath149 where we have assumed that the beam propagates dominantly along the @xmath4 axis , so we have cylindrical symmetry . according to the representation in eq .",
    "( [ lz ] ) , ( [ gvort ] ) is an eigenstate of @xmath12 with eigenvalue @xmath21 , which is also known as the topological charge ( or helicity ) of the vortex . to check this interpretation , note",
    "that , the oam density is also dominantly along the @xmath4 axis and is given by @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the azimuthal component of the poynting vector . in a scalar theory ,",
    "the time - averaged poynting vector can be calculated computed as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is a constant ( with units of m s ) .",
    "the density of the oam of the vortex beam ( [ gvort ] ) then depends on its intensity @xmath154 and wavefront helicity and can be expressed in terms of its power @xmath155 as @xmath156 if we divide now by the total energy density of the field we finally get that the oam per photon can be interpreted precisely as the topological charge @xmath21 . in this way ,",
    "light beams prepared in oam eigenstates can be used in quantum optics experiments in the same way as qudits .",
    "a general scheme of our experimental method is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmm ] . a collimated gaussian beam with complex amplitude @xmath157 illuminates an amplitude mask ( with transmission coefficient @xmath158 ) performing an angular limitation of the beam .",
    "immediately behind the mask , the beam transverse profile has a cake - slice shape given by @xmath159 . according to eq .  , the field azimuthal amplitude distribution results in a spread of the spectrum composed of vortex components with different topological charges and amplitudes .",
    "the beam propagates toward a spiral phase mask [ with transmission @xmath160 introducing a helicity @xmath161 . behind the phase mask ,",
    "the transmitted field is fourier analyzed , so its spatial spectrum @xmath162 can be obtained as @xmath163 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath164 denotes the fourier transform , @xmath165 is the impulse response function of free - space propagation between the amplitude and phase masks and @xmath166 is the convolution product .",
    "the detected power can be thus interpreted as the spectral intensity collected at the power meter placed at the back focal plane of the lens used for the optical implementation of the fourier transform .        as we show below ,",
    "provided the aperture radius of the power meter is suitably chosen , the measured power can be used for estimating the oam of the vortex mode with topological charge @xmath167 in the field behind the amplitude mask .",
    "this procedure can be repeated with spiral phase masks of different topological charges yielding the vortex distribution ( i.e. , angular - momentum spectrum ) of the prepared angular - restricted beam .",
    "several experimental realizations of this idea have been proposed and realized  @xcite , differing in technical details and data analysis  @xcite .    to put this in quantitative terms ,",
    "let us first introduce a mode decomposition of the amplitude mask @xmath168 where @xmath169 are fourier coefficients .",
    "we assume that the waist of the gaussian beam ( of width @xmath170 ) is placed exactly at the mask plane .",
    "the transmitted field propagates through free space , so the complex amplitude @xmath171 of the field impinging on the spiral phase mask can be written in the form @xmath172 where we have used cylindrical coordinates @xmath173 and @xmath174 here @xmath175 and @xmath176 denote the @xmath21-th order bessel function of the first kind and a constant amplitude of the gaussian beam , respectively , and @xmath4 is the distance between amplitude and phase masks . the integration in ( [ integral ] ) can be carried out and results in @xmath177 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 .",
    "after transmission through the spiral phase mask , the fourier transform of the field is performed optically and the spatial distribution at the back focal plane of the fourier lens can be represented by the complex amplitude @xmath162 given by @xmath179    \\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}a_{m } \\overline{v}_{m}(\\nu ) \\exp[i(m - n)\\psi ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 here @xmath181 are polar coordinates in the transverse fourier plane @xmath182 , defined as @xmath183 and @xmath184 , @xmath185 being the lens focal length .",
    "the power captured by the circular aperture of the meter placed at the focal plane of the lens is given by @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 denotes the aperture radius .",
    "substituting ( [ casignal ] ) into ( [ defpower ] ) , the detected power can be expressed as @xmath189 where @xmath190 this power appears as composed of two terms : the first term , @xmath191 , represents the power carried by the vortex mode of topological charge @xmath167 . the second term , @xmath192 , is a crosstalk that represents disturbing contributions of the remaining vortex components and it can be reduced by a convenient choice of the aperture radius @xmath188 of the power meter .",
    "this possibility follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ casignal ] ) , since @xmath193 and has its maximum in the middle of the receiving aperture , while @xmath194 for @xmath195 .",
    "the spectral intensity of the vortex whose power is measured creates a sharply peaked bright spot at the fourier plane , meanwhile , the spectral intensities contributing to the crosstalk power have an annular form .",
    "these different spatial shapes enable an optimal choice of the radius of the receiving aperture . in this case , both the power lost of the measured vortex and the influence of the crosstalk are minimized .",
    "to verify our theory , the angle - angular momentum uncertainty products were experimentally measured on various light beams . given the small difference between the optimal mathieu beams and other suboptimal single - peaked angular distributions , such a measurement is also an indicator of the resolution attainable with the present commercially available technology .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows our setup .",
    "the beam generated by the laser ( verdi v2 : 532 nm , 20  mw ) is spatially filtered , expanded and collimated by the lens and impinges on the hologram generated by the amplitude spatial light modulator ( slm ) ( crl opto , @xmath196 pixels ) .",
    "the bitmap of the hologram is computed as an interference pattern of the tested state ( with the desired angular amplitude distribution ) and an inclined reference plane wave . after illuminating the hologram with the collimated beam",
    ", the fourier spectrum of the transmitted beam is localized at the back focal plane of the first fourier lens fl@xmath197 .",
    "it consists of three diffraction orders @xmath198 .",
    "the undesired 0 and @xmath199 orders are removed by a spatial filter .",
    "after inverse fourier transformation , performed by the second fourier lens fl@xmath200 , a collimated beam with the required complex amplitude profile @xmath201 is obtained .",
    "this completes the state preparation .",
    "the analysis begins by reflecting the prepared field @xmath202 at a phase slm ( boulder , @xmath203 pixels ) , whose reflectivity is proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "as it has been discussed in the previous section , after the fourier transformation of the reflected field , the spectral component whose helicity was eliminated by the phase slm gives rise to a bright spot ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) , while the other components have an annular intensity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) .",
    "the vortex components of the spiral spectrum can be subsequently selected by the phase slm and their oam determined by a power measurement performed with an optimal aperture size of the power meter . to suppress crosstalks ,",

    "the corresponding measured raw data are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : crosstalk ] ) . for an ideal detection , the pure vortex mode with the topological charge",
    "@xmath167 should have a @xmath206-like angular momentum spectrum with a sharp peak at @xmath207 .",
    "any real detection scheme suffers from crosstalks between modes , which tends to broaden the measured spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ; this effect becomes more pronounced for larger helicities ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "it can be seen , from comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : data ] and [ fig : crosstalk ] , that the reliability of the measured spectrum decreases from the center ( @xmath209 ) to the edges and that beams of smaller variances have broader angular spectra and _ vice versa_. hence the reliability of experimentally determined uncertainty products is expected to increase with variance .    in the next step ,",
    "the acquired response functions were used to increase the resolution of our detection scheme .",
    "since the measured spectra could be considered to be convolutions of true angular spectra and known response functions , we could apply an inverse transformation to minimize the effect of crosstalks .",
    "then , the angular - momentum variances were estimated by fitting the deconvoluted data to the theoretically - calculated distributions .",
    "the family of distributions used for fitting experimental data was parametrized by an overall normalization factor and a parameter characterizing the angular width of the corresponding state .",
    "for example , the fitting procedure applied to data measured on a mathieu beam yielded the value of parameter @xmath90 , which was then used to determine the variance of angular momentum via eq .  .    .",

    "the inspection of the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] shows that the measurements of the optimal mathieu and von mises beams yield very similar results .",
    "this could be expected , since the difference between the uncertainty products of these two beams ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison]c ) is below the resolution of the present setup .",
    "the cosine and wedge angle distribution in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] can be discriminated from the optimum more easily .",
    "while the suboptimality of the cosine distribution is confirmed only for moderate to large variances @xmath211 , the wedge angular shape shows entirely different behavior : the uncertainty product increases with the variance .",
    "this tendency of the wedge distribution can be readily explained : as the variance gets larger , more and more side maxima of the sinc - like angular momentum spectrum fall into the detected window @xmath212 $ ] , yielding a corresponding grow of the uncertainty product .",
    "in conclusion , we have formulated rigorous uncertainty relations for angle and angular momentum based on circular variance as a proper statistical measure of angular error .",
    "fundamental mathieu states were identified as intelligent states under the constraint of given uncertainty either in angle or in angular momentum . in this sense ,",
    "the mathieu states provide the optimal distribution of information between the two observables with possible applications in information processing .",
    "an optical test of the uncertainty relations was performed by using spatial light modulators both for the beam preparation and analysis .",

    "further improvements both on the detection scheme and on hardware are highly desirable .",
    "our scheme is conceptually simple but suffers from crosstalks and artifacts , especially at large helicities .",
    "new detection schemes based on direct sensing of beam wavefront could perhaps solve this problem .",
