    "the angular auto - correlation function of galaxies , @xmath0 , encodes a wealth of information , about both cosmology and the properties of galaxies .",
    "wide - field surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , allow precise calculations of @xmath0 over a range of scales spanning over three orders of magnitude  thereby probing both the clustering of galaxies dominated by interactions within dark matter halos and also the clustering of galaxies that is determined by the matter density field .",
    "angular clustering measurements made using data from photometric surveys are complicated by the fact that such surveys can only easily provide precise information on the locations of galaxies in two dimensions , while many analyses of interest require knowledge of the three dimensional distribution .",
    "multi - band surveys , such as sdss , allow estimation of photometric redshifts , and thus with careful treatment , one can estimate the radial distribution of galaxies and split the galaxies by redshift , type , and luminosity . as a result",
    ", one can investigate the evolution of galaxies with photometric data .",
    "the techniques to do this are gaining in importance , as many of the next generation of wide - field surveys will rely primarily on photometric redshifts to gain knowledge of their respective radial distributions ( e.g. , des , panstarrs , lsst ) .    using the auto - correlation function of galaxies to study their properties",
    "has been aided in recent years by the development of the ` halo - model ' ( see , e.g. @xcite ) as a way of parameterising galaxy bias .",
    "one can fill dark matter halos with galaxies based on a statistical ` halo - occupation - distribution ' ( hod ) , allowing one to model the clustering of galaxies within halos ( and thus non - linear scales ) while providing a self consistent determination of the bias at linear scales .",
    "thus , as shown by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ross & brunner ( 2009 ; hereafter r09 ) one can use measurements of galaxy auto - correlation functions to constrain the hods of different sets of galaxies and to gain information on the nature in which galaxies occupy dark matter halos .",
    "many recent studies have used clustering measurements to study the evolution of galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite measured the auto - correlation functions of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) and interpreted the results with the halo model to show that their evolution is inconsistent with passive evolution , while @xcite were able to determine , via luminosity weighted power - spectrum measurements , that the non - passive evolution is due primarily to lower luminosity lrgs .",
    "@xcite used auto - correlation function measurements to constrain the hods of sdss spectroscopic galaxies ( @xmath9 ) and deep2 galaxies ( @xmath10 ) , allowing them to investigate the evolution of the hod , stellar mass , and satellite fraction of galaxies over a relatively large range of luminosities .",
    "ross et al . ( 2007 ; hereafter r07 ) studied the clustering of sdss dr5 galaxies split by redshift between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and found significantly larger bias at higher redshift , especially for late - type galaxies .    in this paper , we use galaxies photometrically selected from the sdss seventh data release ( dr7 ) to investigate the evolution of galaxies between redshifts 0.1 and 0.4 .",
    "while this represents a relatively small range in redshift , our study offers a unique combination in that it utilizes over 6000 square degrees of observing area ( after masking ) and the evolution we study is for galaxies drawn entirely from the sdss ( and we thus do not have to worry about selection techniques of different surveys or differing calibration issues ) .",
    "we are thus able to precisely measure the angular auto - correlations of sdss galaxies , use the halo - model to interpret them , and self - consistently compare the results at different redshifts .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows :  [ sec : data ] describes the creation of our galaxy catalog and its five subsamples , its angular masking , and our methods for estimating the redshift distributions of each subsample ;  [ sec : tools ] describes how we measure the angular auto - correlation functions of these galaxies and how we model the results ;  [ sec : res ] presents the results of our auto - correlation function measurements and the best - fit hod for each redshift slice ; in  5 we use cross - correlation measurements to investigate potential systematics , in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] we discuss the physical implications of our results ; finally , we conclude in  [ sec : con ] . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we use data from the northern , contiguous area of the sdss seventh data release ( dr7 ) .",
    "this survey obtains wide - field ccd photometry ( @xcite ) in five passbands ( @xmath17 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dr7 contains a moderate increase over the dr5 imaging area ( @xmath18 500 square degrees ) , but the precision and accuracy of its photometric redshift catalog represents a substantial improvement over previous data releases ( @xcite ) .",
    "we select galaxies from the dr7 photoz catalog with de - reddened @xmath2-band magnitudes ( @xmath19 ) less than 21 .",
    "redshifts in this catalog were estimated using a hybrid template / empirical approach , and the output includes rest - frame absolute magnitudes , k - corrections , and galaxy - type values .",
    "we use this information to construct an approximately volume - limited sample , using the methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "our resulting criteria are that galaxies have photometric redshifts @xmath20 and @xmath2-band absolute magnitudes , @xmath21 ( equivalent to @xmath22 ) .    figure [ fig : mvz ] displays our galaxy selection criteria in dotted redlines , plotted over the shaded black region of @xmath23 parameter space where galaxies with @xmath24 exist in the sdss dr7 photoz catalog .",
    "we make our selection at @xmath3 , rather than the very edge of the shaded region ( @xmath25 ) , in order to account for differences in k - corrections between different galaxy types ( which can be as high as 1 at @xmath26 in the @xmath2-band ) .",
    "we applied imaging masks and cuts on seeing and reddening at @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( as in r07 ) to the survey area , while cutting out data with flags indicating poor photometry / spurious object detection .",
    "this left a total of 3,123,487 galaxies with @xmath1 , occupying 6019 square degrees of observed sky .",
    "parameter - space in which we find galaxies is shaded black .",
    "red dotted lines define the boundaries of our selection criteria ( @xmath3 , @xmath20).,width=317 ]    we split the sample by redshift into five samples with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath12 . while splitting the samples in this manner means that they are not mutually exclusive , it allows for a test of whether the redshift evolution is smooth ( any sharp transition might imply a systematic in the data ) . reducing the width of the redshift slices further would not provide significantly more information , as the error on the photometric redshifts is @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "we take care in estimating the form of each of our redshift distributions , as this is quite important to our analysis .",
    "we treat each individual galaxy s redshift as a gaussian pdf based on its maximum likelihood redshift and associated error , and convolve this pdf with volume and luminosity function ( lf ) constraints .",
    "volume arguments imply that a galaxy is more likely to have a larger redshift than a smaller one , while lf arguments imply that a galaxy is more likely to be faint than bright .",
    "thus , we sample the gaussian pdf to find a redshift we refer to as @xmath35 and determine the sampled absolute magnitude , @xmath36 , by adding to @xmath37 the difference in distance modulus between @xmath38 and @xmath35 . in order to apply the volume and lf constraints , we weight each sampled redshift by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath38 , and @xmath41 is the best - fit schecter form of the lf determined by @xcite for @xmath2-band sdss galaxies .",
    "we sample each galaxy s gaussian pdf 10 times and find @xmath42 for each sampling .",
    "we normalise such that the sum of @xmath42 adds to 1 for each galaxy ( in order to insure that each galaxy contributes to the overall @xmath43 at the same level ) and then add each of the 10 normalised @xmath42 to their appropriate bin ( we use bins of width @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , when completed for galaxies in a given sample , we have an estimate for the total number galaxies at @xmath45 included in the sample .",
    "each @xmath43 is then normalised by dividing each bin by @xmath46 and we interpolate between bins to obtain a continuous , normalised , @xmath43 .",
    "our construction of @xmath43 eliminates unphysical results  such as non - zero probability at redshift 0 .",
    "it is similar to the treatment presented in section 4.2 of @xcite , but we apply the treatment to each galaxy rather than bin in magnitude . in general , the resulting redshift distributions are similar to the distributions one gets from gaussian sampling ( the lf and volume effects tend to cancel each other ) but have lower values at the tails of the distribution .    figure [ fig : nzcom ] displays the normalised ( such that they integrate to 1 ) redshift distributions of our galaxy sample with @xmath12 .",
    "the solid line displays @xmath43 determined using gaussian sampling combined with lf and volume considerations , while the dashed line displays the result obtained using only gaussian sampling . for this sample ,",
    "the median redshift is shifted to a slightly lower value , and the distribution has lower values at the tails ( resulting in a stronger peak ) .",
    "the shift in redshift is due to the fact that our galaxies have magnitudes close to @xmath47 , and the lf thus suggests that a decrease in redshift is more likely than an increase since the decrease will lower the luminosity .    , determined combining gaussian sampling with lf and volume considerations ( solid line ) and using only gaussian sampling ( dashed line).,width=317 ]    figure [ fig : nzdr7 ] displays the normalised redshift distributions for each redshift slice ( incorporating the lf and volume effects , as one can assume we do from here - on ) .",
    "the distributions get wider as the median redshift increases due to the fact that the mean redshift error increases with redshift ( see table [ tab : dr7z4 ] ) .",
    "each individual distribution appears roughly gaussian .",
    "we can estimate the true absolute magnitude distributions in a manner that is similar to our estimation of @xmath43 .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined at the beginning of this section , but bin in @xmath37 instead of redshift .",
    "it is important to consider the true distribution of @xmath37 in each of our samples because one may worry that applying the same cut on absolute magnitude to samples with differing photometric redshift errors could yield significantly different magnitude distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : magdist ] displays the normalised ( such that they integrate to 1 ) @xmath37 distributions for each of our samples ( @xmath29 , black ; @xmath30 , red ; @xmath31 , blue ; @xmath32 , green ; and @xmath12 , magenta ) .",
    "the peak of each of the distributions occurs near @xmath48 and there are only slight differences between the samples .",
    "the higher redshift samples display slightly broader distributions ( due to the fact that they have larger photometric redshift errors ) and the broadening occurs most prominently at the faint end of the distributions .",

    ", we use the redshift distribution to calculate the weighted number density , @xmath53 , of observed galaxies using @xmath54 where @xmath40 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath38 , @xmath55 is the fraction of observed sky , @xmath56 is the speed of light , @xmath57 is the rate of expansion , and @xmath43 is the un - normalised redshift distribution . equation ( [ eq : ngal ] ) determines the number density of galaxies that contributes to a clustering measurement , and is therefore the best estimate of the observed number density of galaxies in a photometric redshift bin .    for our models , we need to know the true number density of galaxies for a given sample , and this is necessarily larger than the observed number density obtained from equation ( [ eq : ngal ] ) .",
    "if we assume our observed galaxies are a random sampling of this complete sample , the incompleteness should not affect our ability to model our measurements as long as we have a good estimate of the true number density .",
    "we therefore assume the true number density of galaxies , @xmath58 , does not evolve with redshift and estimate @xmath58 by taking the total number of galaxies in the @xmath29 sample and dividing it by the co - moving volume given by this redshift range .",
    "this yields @xmath59mpc@xmath60 .",
    "we can thus compare the number density given by equation ( [ eq : ngal ] ) to 0.0049 @xmath61mpc@xmath60 in order to estimate the completeness of each sample .",
    "this will not be a concern for the modelling ( which will always use @xmath59mpc@xmath60 ) , but it will help us determine the quality of each of our data samples .",
    "all of our samples will suffer incompleteness , in terms of the fraction of galaxies that contribute to the clustering signal , due to galaxies whose photometric redshift estimates have scattered them out of a particular redshift bin .",
    "this effect is made clear by considering the redshift distributions of figure [ fig : nzdr7 ] .",
    "each individual distribution clearly displays a significant portion of its curve lying outside bounds of its hard cut on photometric redshift ( for example , the @xmath43 of the @xmath12 slice has significant amplitudes at @xmath11 and @xmath62 ) . naturally , this effect grows larger as the mean redshift error of galaxies increases .",
    "we display the number , the weighted number density ( @xmath53 ) , the median redshift ( @xmath63 ) , the mean redshift error of galaxies ( @xmath64 ) , the median @xmath2-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath37 ) , the completion ( i.e. @xmath53/0.0049 ) , and the weighted fraction of galaxies with type value @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for each redshift slice in table 1 .",

    "this suggests that we are comparing galaxies of the same luminosity in every sample .    the sharp decrease in completion for galaxies with @xmath68",
    "is coupled with a sharp increase in the mean redshift error . for our sample with the highest redshifts ( @xmath12 )",
    ", there is a significant decrease in the completion ( from 0.48 to 0.42 ) , but the increase in mean redshift error is not as significant ( 0.051 to 0.054 ) .",
    "this suggests that the data may be suffering from incompletion in the parent @xmath24 sample , due to , e.g. , low surface brightness objects ( which @xcite suggests may be an issue ) and also the effects of malmquist bias , since our @xmath20 limit is imposed partly due to our @xmath24 limit .",
    "we calculate the weighted late - type fraction by finding @xmath69 via equation ( [ eq : ngal ] ) ( using @xmath70 ) and dividing the result by @xmath53 .",
    "we split the data at @xmath71 , since this split yields similar late - type fractions as the split used by r09 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is important , as it affects both the overall bias and the shape of @xmath0 .",
    "for all of the data with @xmath72 , the @xmath66 are consistent to within 10% ( and there is no overall trend ) .",
    "there is , however , a large decrease in @xmath66 in the highest redshift slice .",
    "this suggests that the large decrease in completeness in this slice may be tied to a deficit of late - type galaxies in our sample",

    "this allows us to determine if the trends we observe are driven by a single galaxy type . in this work",
    ", we refer to galaxies with @xmath65 as late - type and those with @xmath73 as early - type .",

    "we also employ the ` minimal mixing ' modeling constraints described by equations 20 - 23 of r09 in order to calculate the model @xmath0 of early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "these equations place the constraint that early- and late - type galaxies occupy separate halos , as much as the overall statistics allow , onto the calculation of the model @xmath0 .",
    "generally , such a model does not allow galaxies of different type to exist in the same low - mass halos but will allow late - type galaxies to exist as satellites , around early - type central galaxies , in more massive halos .",
    "this is opposed to a ` full - mixing ' model , which places no constraints and thus assumes no environmental dependence other than mass .",
    "the measured @xmath0 for early- ( top ) and late - type ( bottom ) galaxies are displayed in the left - hand panels of figure [ fig : z4el ] , plotted against the best - fit hod model ( solid lines ; same colour scheme as figure [ fig : w2norm ] ) .",
    "the general results are consistent with previous results ( e.g. , @xcite , r09 ) ; the early - type galaxies have larger amplitudes than the late - types , and the shape of @xmath0 at intermediate angular scales ( between about 0.01@xmath83 and 0.1@xmath83 ) is concave for the early - type galaxies and convex for the late - type galaxies .    interestingly ,",
    "the differences between the @xmath32 and @xmath12 measurements are not dramatic when the galaxies are split by type ( unlike for the full sample .",
    "when split by type , the bias values of the best - fit models for the galaxies in the @xmath12 slice are only moderately larger than that of the @xmath32 slice .",
    "this suggests that the differences in the full sample are driven by the fact that @xmath66 decreases dramatically in the @xmath12 sample , causing the small - scale amplitudes to be dramatically larger ( and a high satellite fraction found for the best - fit hod ) and the overall bias to be larger . we may therefore wish to consider only the galaxies with @xmath72 when discussing the overall implications of the evolution we observe .",
    "the goodness of fit is not ideal for any of the samples , as the @xmath84 presented in table [ tab : hodel ] , are significantly greater than 1 in each case .",
    "we note , however , that in each case the minimum @xmath85 are far smaller than what is achievable with a model that allows mixing .",
    "the models have difficulty reproducing the shape of the late - type measurements around where they exhibit an increase in slope ( @xmath86 ) . in each case , the best - fit model increases in slope at a larger angular scale than the measurement does .",
    "this suggests imperfections in model .",
    "we do not attempt to improve the model , but we do note that the assumption that late - type galaxies are distributed in halos like an nfw profile is probably incorrect ( as one would infer from the morphology - density relationship , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shapes of the best - fit hods of the early- ( top ) and late - type ( bottom ) galaxies are displayed in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : z4el ] .",
    "the @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 parameters that define these fits are are presented in tabel [ tab : hodel ] .",
    "the mass cutoff profiles show similar behavior as the best - fit hods of the full samples  the cut - off grows increasingly sharp with redshift for both the early- and late - type best - fit hods .",
    "the shapes of the late - type hods show significant differences at around @xmath87 , where each hod shows a local maximum .",
    "closer inspection reveals that the values of @xmath88 , @xmath81 , and @xmath79 are strongly correlated  a smaller @xmath88 results in a smaller @xmath81 , a larger @xmath79 , and a sharper peak at the local maximum .",
    "we thus do not attribute any special significance to this behaviour .",
    "the evolution we find in the early-/late - type hods appears to be driven primarily by the evolution of the best - fit hods of the full samples .    at larger scales , where the 2-halo term dominates , there is good agreement between the models and the measurements , and we can therefore trust the bias of each best - fit model ( presented in table [ tab : hodel ] ) .",
    "the bias increases by @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the late- and early - type galaxies , respectively .",
    "this increase in bias is significantly greater than the few percent change one would expect of a passively evolving sample ( for @xmath91 at @xmath92 , the passively evolved sample would have @xmath93 at @xmath94 ; for @xmath95 at @xmath92 , the passively evolved bias would be 1.15 at @xmath94 ) .",
    "the fact that both the early- and the late - type galaxies display significant increases in bias over that of a passively evolving sample means that we can not attribute the evolution in bias that we observe in the full sample to galaxies of a certain type .",
    "either the average halo bias of galaxies of both type is decreasing , or the contamination between our samples is large enough ( due to , e.g. , edge - on late - type galaxies reddened by dust lanes ; @xcite ) to cause the bias of both samples to decrease .",
    "the main conclusions we can draw from our measurements of the correlation functions of early- and late - type galaxies are that the minimum mixing model continues to be favoured over one that allows uninhibited mixing and that the inconsistencies we found in the clustering of the @xmath12 galaxies are due primarily to this sample s relatively low late - type fraction .",
    "one issue with the potential to cause systematic errors in the interpretation of our measurements is our estimation of the redshift distribution of each of our galaxy samples .",
    "if our distributions were systematically affected such that we over - predict the width of the distributions , we would incorrectly interpret our clustering measurements as having a higher bias . if , for example , the magnitude of this problem grew with redshift , it would cause us to ( incorrectly ) determine that the bias was growing larger with redshift .",
    "one way to test the accuracies of our redshift distributions is to perform an angular cross - correlation measurement , @xmath96 , between redshift bins .",
    "we therefore measure three @xmath96 : between @xmath29 and @xmath31 ; @xmath30 and @xmath32 ; and @xmath31 and @xmath12 . in each of these cases ,",
    "any cross - correlation signal is due to the fact that , while there is no overlap in the photometric redshift , the errors on the photometric redshifts imply that the true redshift distributions overlap ( as can be seen clearly in figure [ fig : nzdr7 ] ) .",
    "one can define a factor @xmath97 as @xmath98 where we have simply replaced @xmath99 from equation ( [ eq : wnz ] ) with the multiple of the two redshift distributions of the galaxies that are being cross - correlated .    similarly to @xmath100 ,",
    "the @xmath97 factor quantifies how much of the underlying clustering signal we should observe .",
    "we can expect that this underlying clustering signal of these cross - correlations should be similar to the real - space clustering of the galaxies in the intervening bin ( i.e. , for the cross - correlation between the @xmath29 and @xmath31 redshift slices , the real - space galaxy clustering signal should be similar to that of the @xmath30 sample ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect , based on our redshift distributions , to measure a cross - correlation signal with amplitude @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are calculated using the redshift distribution of the intervening redshift slice .",
    "if we do not measure such a signal , it implies that our redshift distributions may be estimated incorrectly .     and @xmath31 redshift slices ( bottom ) ,",

    "the bottom panel displays the cross - correlation of the @xmath29 and @xmath31 redshift slices ( black error - bars ) , compared to the measured auto - correlation of the @xmath30 redshift slice multiplied by @xmath106 ( solid black line ) .",
    "all of the data displayed is divided by the power - law 0.004@xmath104 , for clarity . at large scales , where the 2-halo term dominates , the measurements are consistent .",
    "the error - bars on the cross - correlation are quite large .",
    "this is due to the fact that the overlap between the two redshift slices is small ( @xmath105 is 0.278 ) .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath29 and @xmath31 redshift distributions is mainly at the high - redshift tail of the @xmath29 slice and the low - redshift tail of the @xmath31 slice ( see figure [ fig : nzdr7 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that much of the cross - correlation signal is due to pairs of relatively high luminosity late - type galaxies ( from the @xmath29 slice ) and relatively low luminosity late - type galaxies ( from the @xmath31 slice ) , since late - type galaxies have the highest redshift errors and are thus most likely to occupy the tails of the redshift distribution .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : z4cross ] displays the measured autocorrelation of late - type galaxies with @xmath30 , multiplied by @xmath105 .",
    "its values are more consistent with the measured cross - correlation , suggesting that late - type galaxies do indeed dominate the clustering signal of cross - correlation .",
    "the late - type amplitudes are smaller than that of the cross - correlation , suggesting that while the late - type galaxies dominate measurement , there is still some contribution from early - type galaxies ( as one would expect since they are included in the measurement ) .",
    "we therefore believe this cross - correlation measurement is consistent with the redshift distributions we estimate for the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 slices    the middle panel of figure [ fig : z4cross ] displays the cross - correlation between the @xmath30 and @xmath32 redshift slices ( black error - bars ) compared to the auto - correlation of the @xmath31 redshift slice multiplied by @xmath105 ( solid black line ) . at large scales ,",
    "the two measurements agree extremely well , and we once again measure smaller amplitudes for the cross - correlation at small scales , but to lessor degree than in the bottom panel .",
    "this makes sense given our previous explanation , as the overlap between these redshift slices is greater ( @xmath105 has increased to 0.327 ) and the resulting cross - correlation is not dominated to the same degree by galaxies that are likely to be found in the tails of the redshift distribution .",
    "thus , once more we find the cross - correlation measurement to be consistent with our estimation of the redshift distributions , in this case those for the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 slices .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : z4cross ] displays the cross - correlation between the @xmath31 and @xmath12 redshift slices ( black error - bars ) compared to the auto - correlation of the @xmath32 redshift slice multiplied by @xmath105 ( solid black line ) . in this case",
    ", the measurements do not agree as well at large scales , but do agree better at small scales .",
    "the measured cross - correlation is larger than we would expect at large scales .",
    "this suggests two possibilities ; either the bias of galaxies that contribute to the cross - correlation measurement are significantly higher than those in the @xmath32 redshift slice , or @xmath97 is in truth larger than we calculate because we have incorrectly estimated the redshift distributions .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the redshift distribution of the @xmath12 is wider than we have estimated . this would imply only that the bias for this redshift slice has been under - estimated , and it would only strengthen our findings that the bias of galaxies increases with redshift beyond what one would expect from passive evolution .",
    "our cross - correlation measurements suggest that our estimation of the redshift distributions has not introduced a systematic error that could be responsible for the trend we find with bias .",
    "we are , therefore , confident that the trend we find  that with increasing redshift the linear bias of galaxies with @xmath3 increases significantly beyond that of a passively evolving sample of galaxies  is real .",
    "we find that the bias of galaxies with @xmath3 increases with redshift significantly beyond the increase in bias one expects of a passively evolving system .",
    "this implies that the galaxies themselves must be evolving under the influence of physical interactions , such as mergers , star formation , or cannibalisation of satellites , etc .. we can rule out the passive effect of ageing stellar populations as a cause for our observations .",
    "this effect would cause the galaxies to dim and therefore suggests that galaxies at @xmath34 should be compared to less luminous galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "however , if we were to include less luminous galaxies in our @xmath29 redshift slice , we would measure an even lower bias .",
    "we therefore know that attempting to account for such evolution , as measurements of the luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest is present , would only enhance the trend we observe .",
    "if we had cut at approximately @xmath107 for each sample ( which would have meant a difference of @xmath18 0.3 in @xmath37 over our full redshift range based on the evolutionary factors determined by @xcite ) , the increase in bias with redshift that we observed would have been even stronger .",
    "this implies that our @xmath108 values likely would have been smaller at low redshift than at high .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies from deep2 had a higher @xmath108 than those selected from sdss with similar @xmath109 values , which is thus in agreement with our results .",
    "using a fixed luminosity cut , however , allows us to obtain a fundamental result  galaxies of the same luminosity reside in halos of approximately the same mass , independent of any change in redshift between 0.1 and 0.4 .",
    "our best - fit hod models imply that the hod evolves very little with redshift , but this lack of evolution actually implies significant evolution in the large - scale bias of the galaxies . in order to remove the effect of halo mass growth between redshift slices",
    ", we can match hods by determining the present day bias of passively evolved dark matter halos .",
    "evolution in bias is not deterministic , but is statistical in nature : the mass of each halo will follow an evolutionary track with a strong stochastic element , that is independent from the large - scale clustering . when analysing a sample of halos at different redshifts , it is therefore difficult to try to disentangle the effects of structure growth with the growth of galaxies",
    ". however , we can use the known bias evolution for a passively evolving population , as a weighted prediction for the evolution of the bias of each sample .",
    "we adopt the following procedure : first , we calculate @xmath110 for each halo mass of the given best - fit hod ( which is evaluated at its own respective median redshift ) .",
    "we then take this bias and use equation ( [ eq : b0 ] ) to obtain the passively evolved @xmath111 bias of the halo , which we denote @xmath5 . comparing our best - fit hods as a function of this statistic removes the passive effect of large - scale evolution , leaving the effects of mergers and galaxy formation .",
    "the effect of mergers should be small as relative effects on the bias of galaxies leaving a sample , and those joining , should cancel to a large degree .",
    "thus , for each hod , we obtain @xmath112 as a function of @xmath5 , giving us hod results at different redshifts that we can compare , having accounted for halo growth in the mean .    in figure",
    "[ fig : b0 ] we plot ( with the same colour scheme as figure [ fig : w2norm ] ) the mean occupation of galaxies versus @xmath5 .",
    "the curves at the high - bias end are extremely similar , and there is no trend with redshift .",
    "the major difference between each curve is the value of the bias at which the hod shows significant decline .",
    "this suggests that the difference between our samples is due almost entirely to evolution in the minimum halo bias required for a halo to host a galaxy with @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : b0sfix ] plots the best - fit hods against @xmath5 for @xmath113 .",
    "all five curves lie nearly on top of each other at @xmath114 . going to lower @xmath5 values",
    ", they separate such that the cut - off @xmath5 decreases with redshift , just like as in figure [ fig : b0 ] .",
    "thus , both figures suggest that at low redshift , galaxies with @xmath3 exist in halos in which they did not exist in at higher redshift , i.e. , @xmath115 galaxies are being created ( due to , e.g. , galaxies merging , accreting satellite galaxies in low - mass halos , or undergoing a burst of star formation ) in halos with masses around our nearly constant value of @xmath116 .     with @xmath112 scaled linearly .",
    "the colour scheme is the same as for previous plots ( @xmath29 ( black ) , @xmath30 ( red ) , @xmath117 ( blue ) , @xmath32 ( green ) , @xmath12 ( magenta ) ) .",
    ", width=317 ]    , only for @xmath118.,width=317 ]    at large @xmath5 , both figures [ fig : b0 ] and [ fig : b0sfix ] show all of the best - fit hods to exhibit the extremely similar behaviour , as for both the maximum difference is only @xmath119 and there is no trend with redshift ( the highest and lowest redshift slices are nearly identical , as are the three samples in the middle ) .",
    "our measurements thus require little evolution in the occupation of halos with bias greater than 1.2 , as our nearly constant satellite fractions suggest .",
    "thus , even as they grow in mass , halos with @xmath120 do not see a significant increase in the number of galaxies that occupy them .",
    "our physical interpretation is based on results determined from data with covariance matrices estimated with a jack - knife method and models using one specific set of cosmological parameters .",
    "one may therefore worry that our results may not be robust to changes in the way we estimate covariance matrices or the cosmology we assume in the models .",
    "to learn about the degree to which our results depend on the specific form of the covariance matrices we use , we assume the same percentage error on all measurements and re - determine the best - fit hods for the @xmath29 and @xmath32 samples .",
    "fixing @xmath113 , we find @xmath121 changes to 1.12 for the @xmath29 sample and 1.104 for the @xmath32 sample , while log@xmath122 ) changes to 13.330 and 13.258 , respectively .",
    "the changes in both parameters are minor , as can be seen in figure [ fig : hodbchange ] .",
    "this figure displays the best - fit hods , determined using a fixed percentage error , plotted with dotted lines , and the original data is plotted with solid lines ( black for @xmath29 and green for @xmath32 in both cases ) , against @xmath5 .",
    "there are no significant differences ( the dotted lines are barely identifiable ) ; clearly treating the error in this manner would have no effect on our physical interpretation .",
    "this suggests that our physical interpretation is robust to any reasonable change in the treatment of our error - bars / covariance matrices , given that the results of @xcite suggest jack - knife covariance matrices should perform far better than simply assuming a constant percentage error .",
    "( black ) and @xmath123 , with @xmath88 fixed at 0.3 , and plotted against the @xmath4 passively evolved halo bias , @xmath5 .",
    "the solid lines display the original best - fit ( same data as figure [ fig : b0sfix ] ) , the dotted line displays the best - fits obtained when the error on the @xmath0 is assumed to be the same percentage in all angular bins , and the dashed line displays the result for a flat universe with @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( and using the original covariance matrices).,width=317 ]    we also test our results for a different set of cosmological parameters .",
    "we still assume a flat universe , but change @xmath126 to 0.25 and @xmath127 to 0.04 .",
    "this change does have a significant effect on the hod parameters  @xmath121 changes to 1.115 for the @xmath29 sample and 1.072 for the @xmath32 sample , while log@xmath122 ) changes to 13.240 and 13.172 , respectively .",
    "the resulting hods are plotted in figure [ fig : hodbchange ] against @xmath5 with dashed lines ( black for @xmath29 and green for @xmath32 ) .",
    "while the changes in the hod parameters are significant , they cause only small changes in the hods when plotted against @xmath5 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the new cosmology causes a slight shift to larger @xmath5 values and for @xmath32 the two hods are barely distinguishable .",
    "the lack of change in the best - fit hods when plotted against @xmath5 is due to the fact that the change in the cosmological parameters changes the form of @xmath110  and thus most of the change in the best - fit hod parameters simply reflects the change in @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the changes when the hods are plotted against @xmath5 are minor .",
    "it appears clear that reasonable changes in the cosmology we assume would not cause any significant change in the physical interpretation of our measurements , and our conclusions should therefore be robust .",
    "another way to look at our results is to plot the change in occupation number divided by the change in mass as a function of @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : dndm ] displays this information , in units of @xmath128 , against the _ average _ halo mass for constant @xmath5 values ( vertical lines denote @xmath129 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and 3.0 for reference ) . the four curves display the change between the @xmath12 and @xmath29 best - fit hods ( solid black line ) , the @xmath32 and @xmath29 best - fit hods ( dotted red line ) , the @xmath32 and @xmath29 best - fit hods with @xmath88 fixed at 0.3 ( dashed blue line ) , the @xmath32 and @xmath29 best - fit hods with @xmath88 fixed at 0.3 after changing the assumed ( flat ) cosmology to @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( long - dashed green line ) .",
    "all four curves in figure [ fig : dndm ] display a strong peak at @xmath7 , and this corresponds to an average halo mass of @xmath130 .",
    "halos with @xmath129 gain @xmath131 mass between @xmath132 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , given @xmath133 is @xmath134 , this accreted mass allows the creation of an average of @xmath135 galaxies per halo .",
    "we have thus presented evidence for the following scenario : the bias of @xmath3 galaxies decreases as redshift decreases because these galaxies form preferentially in halos with masses @xmath8 ( independent of redshift ) and the bias of these halos naturally decreases as the universe evolves .    at the high @xmath5 end of figure [ fig : dndm ] , our results are inconclusive . looking at the evolution between @xmath29 and @xmath12 , our results suggest that highly biased halos are actually losing galaxies , which would imply that the number of galaxies that leave the sample , either through mergers or dimming , is greater than the number of galaxies the halos accrete as they accrete mass",
    ". our measurements from the @xmath12 slice may not be reliable , however , so a comparison between @xmath29 and @xmath32 ( red dotted line ) may be more safe .",
    "this comparison suggests that the increase in number slowly decreases , but the same comparison for the best - fit models with @xmath113 suggest a slow increase in the number with bias . in both cases , however , the maximum increase for halos with @xmath136 is @xmath137 .",
    "since all of our best - fit hods have @xmath138 for halo of mass @xmath139 , this gain in occupation number does suggest that there is a net loss of galaxies in high mass halos , as would occur if galaxies merge after entering the halo .",
    ", versus the average halo mass at constant passively evolved @xmath111 bias of the halo .",
    "the solid black line displays result comparing the @xmath29 and @xmath12 best - fit hods , the dotted red line displays the result when comparing the @xmath29 and @xmath32 best - fit hods , the dashed blue line displays the result when comparing the @xmath29 and @xmath32 best - fit hods when @xmath88 is fixed at 0.3 , and the long dashed green line displays the result when comparing the @xmath29 and @xmath32 best - fit hods when @xmath88 is fixed at 0.3 and the cosmological model is changed to a flat universe with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the vertical lines denote selected @xmath5 values.,width=317 ]    figure [ fig : dndm ] suggests a required mass threshold is @xmath140 for @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "this result is in basic agreement with numerical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which show that the fraction of baryonic mass converted into stars peaks at @xmath140 and also the recent results of @xcite , which suggest galaxy formation efficiency peaks at a halo mass slightly lower than @xmath141 .",
    "this implies the following scenario : the ability of a halo to host a galaxy with @xmath3 is tied to its ability to convert its baryonic matter into a sufficient number of stars coalesced into a single galaxy , the efficiency with which a halo can do this is related to its mass , and this implies that the bias of the halos in which galaxies form decreases as the universe evolves .",
    "we therefore find a peak in the @xmath142 versus @xmath5 relationship at the @xmath5 value that corresponds to having the most halos cross the @xmath140 mass threshold .",
    "we have calculated the angular auto - correlation functions of sdss dr7 galaxies with @xmath3 in five overlapping photometric redshift slices with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath12 and we found best - fit hods for each sample by applying the halo model .",
    "the most relevant results are :    @xmath143 the bias increases with redshift and the increase is far greater than one would expect of a passively evolving sample of galaxies .",
    "@xmath143 when we split our sample by galaxy type into early- and late - type samples , we find the increase in bias is similar for both samples .",
    "we also find that the clustering of early- and late - type galaxies is better fit by a minimal mixing model ( as presented in r09 ) than one that allows galaxies to mix freely within halos , though the high @xmath85 values of our best - fit results suggest that the model needs to be further refined .",
    "@xmath143 the best - fit hods of our full sample suggest that the mass cut - off remains nearly constant with redshift ( especially for fixed @xmath88 ) . since halos grow in mass as the universe evolves , one would expect that for a passively evolving sample , the mass cut - off would increase as the redshift gets smaller .",
    "interpreted in terms of the @xmath111 halo bias , @xmath5 , this constant mass cut - off implies smaller cut - off value of @xmath5 at lower redshift , and this allows the lower redshift galaxies to have a lower overall bias .",
    "this implies that galaxies with @xmath3 are forming ( via mergers , delayed star formation , accretion of dwarf galaxies , etc . ) in increasingly less - biased halos as the universe evolves .",
    "@xmath143 comparing the change in occupation number versus the change in mass for halos with constant @xmath5 , we find a strong peak at @xmath7 .",
    "this bias value corresponds to an average halo mass of @xmath87 , suggesting that galaxies with @xmath144 form preferentially in halos of mass @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath143 our results are consistent with previous measurements made testing the evolution of the hod ( e.g. , @xcite ) and numerical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) which predict maximum star formation efficiencies for in halos of mass @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath143 our results are robust against changes in our treatment of the error - bars / covariance and changes in the underlying cosmology . it would be ideal to confirm our results via simulations or semi - analytic galaxy formation models , but we leave such investigations for future study .",
    "future surveys will be able to provide significant follow - up to these results .",
    "des will allow our finding  that @xmath3 galaxies form of constant mass , independent of redshift between @xmath1  to be tested over a much wider range of redshifts and luminosities .",
    "if our results prove robust , we will be able to determine a fundamental relationship between the luminosity of a galaxy and the mass of the halo in which it forms .",
