    "let @xmath3 be a smooth , oriented @xmath0manifold .",
    "then a closed @xmath1form @xmath4 is called _ near - symplectic _ if @xmath5 and there is a metric @xmath6 such that @xmath4 is self - dual harmonic and transverse to the @xmath7section of @xmath8 .",
    "equivalently , without referring to any metric , one could define a closed @xmath1form @xmath4 to be near - symplectic if for any point @xmath9 either @xmath10 , or @xmath11 , and the intrinsic gradient @xmath12 has maximal rank , which is @xmath13 .",
    "the zero - set @xmath14 of such a @xmath1form is a @xmath2dimensional submanifold of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is compact and @xmath15 then hodge theory gives a near - symplectic form @xmath4 on @xmath3 .",
    "clearly , in this case @xmath14 is just a collection of disjoint circles .",
    "furthermore , by deforming @xmath4 , one can show that on any near - symplectic manifold , one can reduce the number of circles to @xmath2 , this was proved in @xcite .",
    "we give a new proof of this result in theorem [ 6.1 ] as an application of the techniques developed in this paper .",
    "of course , the last circle can not be removed unless the underlying manifold is symplectic .",
    "interesting topological information about @xmath3 is captured by the natural decomposition of the normal bundle of these circles , provided by the near - symplectic form .",
    "more precisely , transversality of @xmath4 implies that @xmath16 is an isomorphism , where @xmath17 is the normal bundle to the zero - set of @xmath4 .",
    "this enables us to orient the zero - set @xmath14 .",
    "now consider the quadratic form @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a non - vanishing oriented vector field on @xmath14 .",
    "as @xmath21 , this quadratic form is symmetric and has trace zero .",
    "it follows that , it has three real eigenvalues everywhere , where two are positive and one is negative .",
    "then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the positive and negative eigen - subbundles respectively .",
    "in particular , this allows us to divide the zero - set into two pieces , the even circles where the line bundle @xmath24 is orientable , and the odd circles where @xmath24 is not orientable .",
    "this definition is motivated by the following result of gompf that the number of even circles is equal to @xmath25 modulo @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in particular , observe that if there is only one zero circle which is even , the manifold @xmath3 can not be symplectic .    in this paper , we will be interested in local deformations of near - symplectic forms on a @xmath0manifold .",
    "an important such deformation is provided by the luttinger  simpson model given on @xmath26 where",
    "the birth ( or death ) of a circle can be observed explicitly @xcite : + @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "we will see that this is not the only type of deformation of near - symplectic forms .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to identify such deformations and interpret them in terms of the singular fibrations associated to them .",
    "a _ broken fibration _ on a closed @xmath0manifold @xmath3 is a smooth map to a closed surface with singular set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a finite set of singularities of lefschetz type where around a point in @xmath30 the fibration is locally modeled in oriented charts by the complex map @xmath31 , and b is a @xmath2dimensional submanifold along which the singularity of the fibration is locally modeled by the real map @xmath32 , @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "we remark here that we do not require the broken fibrations to be embeddings when restricted to their critical point set .",
    "in particular , this means that the critical value set may include double points .",
    "there have been two different approaches to constructions of broken fibrations on @xmath0manifolds .",
    "the first approach is by auroux , donaldson and katzarkov @xcite based on approximately holomorphic techniques , generalizing the construction of lefschetz pencils on symplectic manifolds .",
    "the more recent approach is due to gay and kirby @xcite , where the fibration structure is constructed explicitly in two pieces in the form of open books , and then eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures as well as giroux s theorem of stabilization of open books are invoked to glue these two pieces together to form an achiral broken fibration .",
    "achiral here refers to the existence of finitely many lefschetz type singularities with the opposite orientation on the domain , namely the singularity is modeled by the complex map @xmath35 .",
    "there is a correspondence between broken fibrations and near - symplectic manifolds up to blow - up , in analogy with the correspondence between lefschetz fibrations and symplectic manifolds up to blow - up .",
    "more precisely , given a broken fibration on a @xmath0manifold @xmath3 with the property that there is a class @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for every component @xmath38 of every fibre , it is possible to find a near - symplectic form on @xmath3 such that the regular fibres are symplectic and the zero - set of the near - symplectic form is the same as the @xmath2dimensional critical point set of the broken fibration .",
    "this is an adaptation due to auroux , donaldson and katzarkov of gompf s generalization of thurston s argument used in finding a symplectic form on a lefschetz fibration .",
    "conversely , in @xcite , it is proven that on every @xmath0manifold with @xmath39 ( recall that this is equivalent to @xmath3 being near - symplectic ) , there exists a broken fibration if we blow up enough .",
    "one of the questions of interest that remains to be answered is to determine how unique this broken fibration is . in particular",
    ", we would like to find a set of moves on broken fibrations relating two different broken fibrations on a given @xmath0manifold .",
    "one of the main themes of this paper is the discussion of a set of moves which allows one to pass from one broken fibration structure to another .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider a slightly more general type of fibration , where we will allow cuspidal singularities on the critical value set of the fibration .",
    "these type of fibrations occur naturally when one considers deformations of the broken fibrations .",
    "we will also discuss a local modification of a cuspidal singularity ( without changing the diffeomorphism type of the underlying manifold structure ) in order to get a broken fibration .",
    "therefore , one can first deform a broken fibration to obtain a wrinkled fibration , then apply certain moves to this wrinkled fibration , and finally modify the wrinkled fibration in a neighborhood of cuspidal singularities to get a genuine broken fibration . in this way",
    ", one obtains a set of moves on broken fibrations on a given @xmath0manifold .",
    "let @xmath3 be a closed @xmath0manifold , and @xmath40 be a @xmath1dimensional surface .",
    "we say that a map @xmath41 has a _ cusp singularity _ at a point @xmath42 , if around @xmath43 , @xmath44 is locally modeled in oriented charts by the map @xmath45 .",
    "this is what is known as the whitney tuck mapping , the critical point set is a smooth arc , @xmath46 , whereas the critical value set is a cusp , namely it is given by @xmath47 .",
    "this is the generic model for a family of functions @xmath48 , which are morse except for finitely many values of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the signs of the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are chosen so that the functions @xmath52 have only index @xmath2 or @xmath1 critical points .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath53 is a morse function with only index @xmath2 or @xmath1 critical points , then @xmath54 given by @xmath55 is a broken fibration with critical set in correspondence with the critical points of @xmath44 .",
    "notice that the functions @xmath56 are morse except at @xmath34 , where a birth of critical points occur .   +    a wrinkled fibration on a closed @xmath0manifold @xmath3 is a smooth map @xmath44 to a closed surface which is a broken fibration when restricted to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a finite set such that around each point in @xmath58",
    ", @xmath44 has cusp singularities .",
    "we say that a fibration is _ purely wrinkled _ if it has no isolated lefschetz - type singularities .",
    "it might be more appropriate to call these fibrations `` broken fibrations with cusps '' , to avoid confusion with the terminology introduced by eliashberg - mishachev @xcite .",
    "the reason for our choice of terminology is that wrinkled fibrations can typically be obtained from broken lefschetz fibrations by applying wrinkling moves ( see move @xmath0 in section [ section3 ] ) which eliminates a lefschetz type singularity and introduces a wrinkled fibration structure .",
    "conversely , as mentioned above , it is possible to locally modify a wrinkled fibration by smoothing out the cusp singularity at the expense of introducing a lefschetz type singularity and hence get a broken fibration .    1 .",
    "every wrinkled fibration is homotopic to a broken fibration by a homotopy supported near cusp singularities .",
    "2 .   every broken fibration is homotopic to a purely wrinkled fibration by a homotopy supported near lefschetz singularities .",
    "the first part of this paper is concentrated on a set of moves on wrinkled fibrations and corresponding moves on broken fibrations .",
    "all of these moves keep the diffeomorphism type of the total space unchanged .",
    "we remark here that as will be explained below these moves occur as deformations of wrinkled fibrations and not as deformations of broken fibrations . to be more precise , by a _",
    "deformation _ of wrinkled fibrations we mean a one - parameter family of maps which is a wrinkled fibration for all but finitely many values of the parameter .",
    "in fact , as we will see , an infinitesimal deformation of a broken fibration gives a wrinkled fibration whereas the wrinkled fibrations are stable under infinitesimal deformations .",
    "this is indeed the main reason for extending the definition of the broken fibrations to wrinkled fibrations .    in the second part , using techniques from singularity theory , we prove that our list of moves is complete in the sense that any generic infinitesimal deformation of a wrinkled fibration which does not have any lefschetz type singularity is given by one of the moves that we exhibited in section [ section3 ] .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in section [ section3 ] , it is always possible to deform a wrinkled fibration infinitesimally so that the lefschetz type singularities are eliminated .",
    "any one - parameter family deformation of a purely wrinkled fibration is homotopic rel endpoints to one which realizes a sequence of births , merges , flips , their inverses and isotopies staying within the class of purely wrinkled fibrations .",
    "2 .   given two broken fibrations ,",
    "suppose that after perturbing them to purely wrinkled fibrations , the resulting fibrations are deformation equivalent .",
    "then one can get from one broken fibration to the other one by a sequence of birth , merging , flipping and wrinkling moves , their inverses and isotopies staying within the class of broken fibrations .    as in the case of broken fibrations ,",
    "one can define a wrinkled pencil on @xmath3 to be a wrinkled fibration @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a finite set and around a point in @xmath60 , the fibration is locally modeled in oriented charts by the complex map @xmath61 .",
    "note that , after blowing up @xmath3 at the points @xmath60 , one can get a wrinkled fibration .",
    "it is possible to construct a natural near - symplectic form that is `` adapted '' to a given wrinkled pencil .",
    "the key property of this form is that it should restrict to a symplectic form on the smooth fibres of the given wrinkled fibration .",
    "therefore , we can equip every wrinkled pencil with a well - defined deformation class of near - symplectic forms , it is natural thus to study what happens to this class after each move that was described on the previous paragraph .",
    "this will be discussed section [ section5 ] of the paper .    in section [ section6 ] ,",
    "we give a number of applications of our moves on broken fibrations .",
    "notably , by considering the mirror image of the wrinkling move , we prove that we can turn an achiral lefschetz singularity into a wrinkled map and then into a broken fibration , without losing equatoriality of the round handles .",
    "this provides the following simplification of the result of gay and kirby in @xcite :    let @xmath3 be an arbitrary closed @xmath0manifold and let @xmath38 be a closed surface in @xmath3 with @xmath62 .",
    "then there exists a broken lefschetz fibration from @xmath3 to @xmath63 with embedded singular locus , and having @xmath38 as a fibre .",
    "furthermore , one can arrange so that the singular set on the base consists of circles parallel to the equator with the genera of the fibres in increasing order from one pole to the other .",
    "we remark that this disproves the conjecture @xmath64 of gay and kirby in @xcite about the essentialness of including achiral lefschetz singularities for broken fibrations on arbitrary closed @xmath0manifolds .",
    "after the first writing of this paper , an earlier result of a similar nature , but allowing the set of critical values of the fibration to be immersed rather than embedded , has been obtained by baykur in @xcite .",
    "namely , baykur proved an existence theorem for broken fibrations with immersed critical value set by combining the following two ingredients : ( 1 ) a result of saeki @xcite which says that any continuous map from a closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath65 is homotopic to a stable map without definite folds , i.e. in our terminology , a purely wrinkled fibration with immersed critical value set , ( 2 ) the cusp modification described in section @xmath1 of this paper .",
    "another recent development that took place after the writing of this paper is worth mentioning here : akbulut and karakurt @xcite came up with a new proof of the existence theorem stated above by refining the construction of gay and kirby .",
    "the difference between akbulut and karakurt s result and ours is that they directly construct a broken fibration on any @xmath0-manifold , whereas we describe a way to modify achiral lefschetz singularities into broken and lefschetz singularities .",
    "finally , here we would like to discuss our main motivation for studying the particular structure of broken fibrations and their deformations , the wrinkled fibrations .      in @xcite , donaldson and smith",
    "define an invariant of a symplectic manifold @xmath3 by counting holomorphic sections of a relative hilbert scheme that is constructed from a lefschetz fibration on a blow - up of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , by donaldson s celebrated theorem , there exists a lefschetz fibration @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is some blow - up of @xmath3 .",
    "then , for any natural number @xmath68 , donaldson and smith give a construction of a relative hilbert scheme @xmath69 , where the fibre over a regular value @xmath43 of @xmath44 is the symmetric product @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , @xmath71 is a resolution of singularities for the relative symmetric product , which is the fibration obtained by taking the @xmath72 symmetric product of each fibre .",
    "they then define their standard surface count , which is some gromov invariant counting pseudoholomorphic sections of @xmath71 .",
    "usher , in @xcite , proves that this invariant is the gromov invariant of the underlying symplectic @xmath0manifold @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we know that this is in turn equal to the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath3 by the seminal work of taubes @xcite . therefore , one obtains a geometric formulation of the seiberg - witten invariant for a symplectic manifold @xmath3 on a lefschetz fibration structure associated to @xmath3 , which also shows in particular that this invariant is independent of the lefschetz fibration structure .",
    "a similar but technically not so straightforward generalization of this method of getting an invariant from a lefschetz fibration is described in @xcite for the case of broken fibrations , thus giving an invariant for all smooth @xmath0manifolds with @xmath73 .",
    "these are called lagrangian matching invariants . here",
    "we give a quick sketch of the definition of these invariants .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is a near - symplectic manifold with only one zero circle @xmath14 , and @xmath74 is a broken fibration with one circle of singularity along the equator of @xmath63 .",
    "take out a thin annulus neighborhood of the equator and write @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the closed discs that contain the north pole and the south pole respectively .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 , suppose the fibre genus of @xmath79 is @xmath6 and the fibre genus of @xmath80 is @xmath81 . consider the relative hilbert schemes hilb@xmath82 and hilb@xmath83 .",
    "these are symplectic manifolds with boundaries @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "perutz then constructs a sub - fibre bundle @xmath86 of the fibre product @xmath87 which constitutes the lagrangian boundary conditions for the pairs of pseudoholomorphic sections of hilb@xmath82 and hilb@xmath83 in the following sense : one defines @xmath88 to be a gromov invariant for pairs @xmath89 of pseudoholomorphic sections of hilb@xmath82 and hilb@xmath83 such that the boundary values @xmath90 lie in @xmath86 .",
    "now , the big conjecture in this field is of course the conjecture that lagrangian matching invariants equal the seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "this has been verified by perutz , @xcite , in several cases , notably in the case of symplectic manifolds as mentioned above , and when the underlying manifold is of the form @xmath91 , for any @xmath92 which is a @xmath93homology@xmath94 and for connected sums .",
    "an important problem to be explored is that the lagrangian matching invariant is not yet known to be an invariant of the given @xmath0manifold . in other words",
    ", it is an invariant of the near - symplectic manifold together with a given broken fibration structure .",
    "our next task in this field will be to show that the lagrangian matching invariant stays an invariant under the set of moves that we describe in this paper .",
    "we believe that our set of moves will be enough to pass from a given broken fibration structure on a manifold to any other broken fibration structure on the same manifold under suitable hypotheses on the homotopy type of the fibration map .",
    "we have strong evidence for this since , as was mentioned above , the set of moves that we discuss in this paper are sufficient to pass from a given broken fibration to any one - parameter deformation of it .",
    "these two hypotheses would imply that the lagrangian matching invariant is really an invariant of the underlying manifold .",
    "we believe that these steps will play an important role in proving the big conjecture mentioned above .",
    "* acknowledgements :* the author is grateful to his ph.d .",
    "supervisor denis auroux for valuable suggestions and comments .",
    "he is also indebted to tim perutz for encouraging and helpful remarks .",
    "thanks also to karl luttinger for sharing a copy of the unpublished manuscript @xcite and to robion kirby for his interest in this work .",
    "this work was partially supported by an nsf grant ( dms-0600148 ) .",
    "recall from the introduction that a cusp singularity is given locally by the map @xmath95 given by : @xmath96    the critical point set is a smooth arc , @xmath46 , whereas the critical value set is a cusp , namely it is given by @xmath47 .",
    "the idea is to modify a neighborhood of the singular point of the cusp with an allowed model for broken fibrations without changing the topology .",
    "we will do this by surgering out a neighborhood of the cuspidal singularity and gluing back in a neighborhood of an arc together with a lefschetz type singular point as shown in figure @xmath2 .",
    "the issue is to make sure that the fibration structures match outside the neighborhood .        restricting to a neighborhood of the origin",
    ", we get a map @xmath97 and @xmath58 divides the image into two regions , where the fibres above the `` interior region '' are punctured tori , whereas the fibres above the `` exterior region '' are discs , as shown in figure @xmath2 . furthermore , looking above the line @xmath98 , one sees that as the parameter @xmath99 converges to @xmath58 from below , @xmath100 , one of the generating loops of the homology of the torus collapses to a point , and as @xmath99 converges to @xmath58 from above , @xmath101 the other generator collapses to a point .",
    "this is evident from the fact that @xmath102 restricted to the preimage of @xmath98 is a morse function on @xmath103 with @xmath1 critical points of indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 which cancel each other .",
    "now consider the @xmath104valued broken fibration structure described on the right of figure @xmath2 .",
    "let us denote this fibration by @xmath105 .",
    "this fibration is cooked up so that it matches above a neighborhood of the boundary of @xmath104 with the fibre structure of the map @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , by introducing a lefschetz type singularity , we are able to have a broken fibration structure , where the vanishing cycles are described on the right of the figure @xmath2 . in order to perform a local surgery to pass from the map @xmath38 to the described broken fibration @xmath43 , it remains to show that the total space @xmath3 is diffeomorphic to @xmath106 .",
    "this will be accomplished by giving a handle decomposition of @xmath3 , and showing that it is in fact obtained by attaching one @xmath2handle and one @xmath1handle to @xmath106 , in such a way that they can be cancelled .",
    "let us now describe @xmath3 explicitly . denote the standard loops generating homology of a regular fibre by @xmath107 and @xmath108 . as shown in figure @xmath2 , restricting to the line @xmath98 , as @xmath99 approaches to @xmath58 from below , @xmath107 collapses to a point and as @xmath99 approaches to @xmath58 from above , @xmath108 collapses .",
    "( this is to be consistent with the fibre structure of @xmath38 . ) now the monodromy around the lefschetz type singularity must be the dehn twist along @xmath109 , denoted by @xmath110 so that @xmath111 , where we oriented @xmath107 and @xmath108 so that @xmath112 . therefore , restricting to the line @xmath113 , as @xmath49 approaches to the singularity @xmath114 collapses to a point .",
    "( here by @xmath109 we really denote an embedded loop @xmath115 which is equal to @xmath116 $ ] as a homology class . )",
    "we remark here that , just as in lefschetz fibrations , a diagram indicating the fibre structure and vanishing cycles along relevant paths is enough to determine a broken ( or wrinkled ) fibration uniquely on a disc .",
    "we now have an explicit understanding of the various vanishing cycles for x. next we proceed to describe the corresponding handle diagram .",
    "we first restrict to the preimage of the region shown in figure @xmath1 .",
    "this is clearly diffeomorphic to the total space @xmath3 .",
    "now divide this region into @xmath13 parts as shown in figure @xmath1 .",
    "the preimage of region @xmath7 is just @xmath117 .",
    "we claim that the preimage of regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 together is @xmath118 @xmath2handle , and the preimage of all three regions is @xmath119handle @xmath120 @xmath1handle in such a way that the attaching sphere of the @xmath1handle intersects the belt sphere of the @xmath2handle transversely at a single point , so that these two handles can be cancelled .        in this picture",
    ", it is more convenient to fix the reference fibre above a point which lies between regions @xmath2 and @xmath1 as shown in the figure @xmath1 . just for simplicity",
    ", we can choose an identification of this reference fibre with the previous choice using the parallel transport along a simple arc above the lefschetz singularity so that the vanishing cycles in this new reference fibre are given as shown .",
    "finally , observe that we can isotope the base so that the @xmath2dimensional singular set is straightened to a line .",
    "next , we are in a position to see the handle decomposition very explicitly .",
    "in fact , the preimage of the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 can be thought as ( @xmath121 @xmath2handle @xmath122 , where the @xmath123 is the @xmath99 direction .",
    "the belt circle of this @xmath13dimensional @xmath2handle corresponds to the vanishing cycle @xmath107 on a regular fibre above the region @xmath2 , to be precise , fix the regular fibre @xmath38 above a point @xmath43 in region @xmath2 , say @xmath43 lies on the @xmath113 line .",
    "now ( @xmath121 @xmath2handle @xmath124 @xmath2handle where the belt sphere of this latter @xmath0dimensional @xmath2handle intersects @xmath38 at @xmath107 .",
    "now , by construction starting from @xmath38 as one approaches to lefschetz singularity the loop @xmath115 collapses to a point .",
    "it is a standard fact of lefschetz fibrations that gluing the preimage of region @xmath1 corresponds to a @xmath1dimensional handle attachment with attaching circle being the loop @xmath115 on @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "( in fact , if one considers the local model @xmath125 , then @xmath126 is a morse function with one critical point of index @xmath1 at the origin . )",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath127 @xmath2handle @xmath128 @xmath1handle with belt sphere of the @xmath2handle intersects the attaching circle of the @xmath1handle transversely at exactly one point , and this intersection point is precisely the intersection of the loop @xmath107 and the loop @xmath115 on @xmath38 . finally , applying the cancellation theorem of handle attachments , we conclude that @xmath129 as required .",
    "it is of interest to note that one could as well replace a cusp singularity with a broken arc singularity and an achiral lefschetz singularity , where vanishing cycles for the cusp are given by @xmath107 and @xmath108 as before , and the vanishing cycle for the achiral lefschetz singularity is given by @xmath130 ( since one must now have @xmath131 ) .",
    "the difference between a lefschetz singularity and an achiral lefschetz singularity with the same vanishing cycle is in the framing of the corresponding @xmath1handle attachment .",
    "namely , a lefschetz singularity corresponds to @xmath132framing with respect to the fibre framing whereas an achiral lefschetz singularity corresponds to @xmath133framing .",
    "the cancellation theorem of handle attachments does not see the framings , therefore the proof is verbatim .",
    "we remark here that the local modification described in this section is not given as a deformation , in the sense that we have not explained how to give a one - parameter family of wrinkled fibrations which starts from the fibration depicted on the left side of figure @xmath2 and ends at the fibration given on the right side of figure @xmath2 .",
    "we will actually give such a family in the next section , which will in fact give yet another way of proving the validity of the above move .",
    "however , we chose to present the above proof first , as it is considerably simpler and in fact this enabled the author to discover more complicated modifications described in section [ section3 ] , which come equipped with deformations .",
    "afterwards , we were able to recover the above modification as a composition of these deformations .",
    "in this section , we describe a set of moves on wrinkled fibrations .",
    "we first give three such moves which are deformations of wrinkled fibrations and the corresponding deformations which end up being broken fibrations are obtained by applying the modification described in section [ section2 ] , which as was mentioned there , is indeed a deformation . note that this was not proved in the previous section .",
    "this will be accomplished after we describe the last move which enables us to turn a lefschetz singularity into three cusp singularities .",

    "the only singularity is at the origin .",
    "this is a degenerate map , which is not an allowed singularity for a wrinkled fibration . for @xmath137 ,",
    "the critical point set of @xmath138 is the circle @xmath139 , whereas the critical value set @xmath140 is a _ wrinkle _ shown on the left of figure @xmath13 .",
    "this is clearly a wrinkled map .",
    "therefore , we have a deformation of wrinkled maps , the only subtle change being at @xmath113 , where birth of the wrinkle happens .",
    "now , fix @xmath141 .",
    "considering the wrinkle as obtained from gluing two cusps together , we can apply the local modification of section [ section2 ] to obtain a broken fibration on @xmath142 with singular set a circle together with two point singularities as shown on the right of figure @xmath13 .",
    "note that one has to check that the configuration of the vanishing cycles matches the model in section [ section2 ] .",

    "therefore , we obtain a move of broken fibrations , namely whenever one has the configuration described on the left side of figure @xmath0 , one can surger out a @xmath106 and glue in the right side of figure @xmath0 to obtain a new configuration .",
    "we remark here that to apply a merging move , one needs a configuration as in the left side of figure @xmath0 , in particular it is necessary that the vanishing cycles intersect transversely at a unique point . on the other hand , to apply an inverse merging move the following two conditions are necessary .",

    "however , we would like to point out that there is no compatibility condition required for the two sides as long as the fibres in the middle region are connected .",
    "namely , to give an embedding of the fibration depicted on the right side of figure @xmath0 into a fibration that has the same base and whose vanishing cycles satisfy the condition described above , one divides the base into three pieces : a piece on the left that includes the lefschetz singularity and the broken singularity , a middle piece which is a smooth fibration , and a piece on the right which includes the lefschetz singularity and the broken singularity . since the vanishing cycles are as prescribed above , it is easy to construct a fibrewise embedding of the total spaces of the pieces on the left and on the right .",
    "namely , given two simple closed curves intersecting transversely at one point on a fibre @xmath38 , it is always possible to find a diffeomorphism of @xmath38 such that those two curves are standardized , in the sense that they sit in the standard way as part of an embedding of a punctured torus to @xmath38 . finally in order to give an embedding of the total space of the middle piece , one needs to give a fibrewise embedding of the disc fibration @xmath153 such that",

    "if one considers a one - parameter family of deformations of broken fibrations , one can possibly get a flip through a real cusp .",

    "one can calculate that the branch points are given by either @xmath196 , and @xmath197 , or @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "note that , when @xmath200 , we have four branch points ( fibre is double punctured torus ) , and when @xmath201 we have two ( fibre is cylinder ) .",

    "one can then see that depending on @xmath206 we get @xmath0 branch points if we are in the interior region of the critical values or we have @xmath1 solutions if we are in the exterior . corresponding to each of the two variations as above , there are two points in the branch locus which come together whereas the other two stay more or less the same .",
    "more precisely , one can verify that corresponding to each direction , the four branch locus points collapse either along @xmath107 , @xmath108 or @xmath183 as described in figure @xmath207 .",
    "the preimages of these paths by the branched covering map are precisely the vanishing cycles which were also denoted by @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath183 on the doubly punctured torus ( figure @xmath207 ) .",
    "hence one concludes that the three vanishing cycles intersect transversely at a point .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see by explicit calculation as above that as one approaches a cuspidal point for the fibration @xmath138 , in the branched covering picture three of the four branch points come together .",
    "for example , if the vanishing cycles @xmath107 and @xmath108 collapse as one approaches a cusp singularity of @xmath138 , then the end points of the paths @xmath107 and @xmath108 come together in the base of the branched cover picture . reversing our viewpoint , as one crosses a cusp singularity from the low - genus side to the high - genus side the topology of the fibres of @xmath138 is modified by a surgery in a neighborhood of a point in the fibre , which is the preimage of one of the two branch points of the double branched covering map . more precisely , the surgery that we mean is removing a tubular disc neighborhood of a point and gluing back in a punctured torus .",

    "this will allow us to pass to the fourth picture . finally , we perform two flipping moves to get to the final result that we wanted .",
    "let us now describe the missing pieces of the proof in more detail .",
    "first , let s see why one can isotope the second fibration to the third fibration in figure @xmath208 . for this , we will need to identify various vanishing cycles for the second fibration and observe indeed that the vanishing cycles corresponding to the bottom cusp do not interfere with the vanishing cycle corresponding to the arc . for the fibration that we start with , fix a reference fibre at a point @xmath43 halfway between the lefschetz singularity and the singular arc .",
    "recall that the fibre is a punctured torus , and without loss of generality we can assume that the vanishing cycle for the lefschetz singularity is the @xmath107 curve and moving towards the arc singularity the @xmath108 curve vanishes , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are drawn on the left side of in figure @xmath209 .",
    "now , let s apply the wrinkling move to the lefschetz singularity . consider a line segment from @xmath43 to a central point @xmath210 of the triple wrinkle passing through a cusp point ( drawn as a dotted line on the right side of figure @xmath209 ) . as described in the previous section , starting from @xmath43 if we move along this line segment the fibre above @xmath43 undergoes a surgery around a neighborhood of a point on the fibre and the genus increases by @xmath2 .",
    "now since the wrinkling move only affects a tubular neighborhood of the curve @xmath107 , after the modification of the lefschetz singularity by wrinkling move we can choose a reference fibre that is based at the point @xmath210 which looks like the one drawn in the middle of figure @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , the part of the fibre above @xmath43 outside of the tubular neighborhood of @xmath107 is canonically identified to the part of the fibre above @xmath210 outside the doubly punctured torus that appeared after surgery .",
    "more importantly , this latter surgery occurs around a neighborhood of a point which can be isotoped ( if necessary ) to be disjoint from the @xmath108 curve .",
    "hence one can parallel transport the @xmath108 curve from the fibre above @xmath43 to the fibre above @xmath210 , since the place where the surgery occurs is disjoint form the curve @xmath108 .",
    "in particular , the image of @xmath108 in the fibre above @xmath210 is disjoint from the vanishing cycles that correspond to the cusp singularity , which are two simple closed curves on the doubly punctured torus which intersect transversely , we denote them by @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "therefore , by applying a diffeomorphism of the doubly punctured torus if necessary the reference fibre above @xmath210 can be chosen as shown on the right side of figure @xmath209 .",
    "now , it is clear that one can isotope the second fibration to the third fibration in figure @xmath208 , since the vanishing cycle @xmath108 is disjoint from @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "next , to pass from the third fibration to the fourth fibration in figure @xmath208 , we use a merging move . in order to do that , we need to understand the vanishing cycles above the dotted line segment in the third picture in figure @xmath208 . choose a reference fibre above a point in the middle of the dotted line segment .",
    "as before , we can standardize it so that it looks like the right side of figure @xmath209 .",
    "now , as one goes down the curve @xmath108 vanishes and as one goes up the vanishing cycle @xmath213 has the properties that it lies in the doubly punctured torus , intersects @xmath211 and @xmath212 at their intersection point and any path connecting the boundary circles of the doubly punctured torus has to intersect the union of @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 . therefore , comparing figure @xmath209 with figure @xmath181 , @xmath108 has to intersect @xmath213 once .",
    "hence we can perform a merging move .",
    "finally , we apply two flipping moves to the fourth fibration in figure @xmath208 to pass to the fifth fibration . these are also allowed , since the configuration of @xmath211 , @xmath213 , @xmath108 and the configuration of @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath108 match the configuration of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath115 in figure @xmath160 of the flipping move .",
    "this completes the proof of the fact that the fibration on the left of figure @xmath208 is a deformation of the fibration on the right .",
    "in this section , we prove that the set of moves listed in the section [ section3 ] are sufficient to produce any deformation of wrinkled fibrations . more precisely , we prove the following theorem :    [ uniqueness ] let @xmath3 be a compact @xmath0manifold , and let @xmath215 be a deformation of wrinkled fibrations",

    "so we can assume that @xmath180 and @xmath216 have no lefschetz type singularities .",
    "also , since lefschetz type singularities are unstable under small deformations , we can assume that the deformation does not create any new lefschetz singularity .",
    "more precisely , we perturb the deformation by keeping the end points fixed so that we avoid any creation of critical points where @xmath217 vanishes .",
    "this is possible since purely wrinkled fibrations are stable under small perturbation whereas the existence of points where @xmath217 vanishes is not generic .",

    "now move any lefschetz or achiral lefschetz singularities in the southern hemisphere towards the equatorial region ( moving across circles towards the higher genus region as in theorem [ connectedness ] ) . then in the southern hemisphere we are left with only a bunch of parallel circles on the tropic of capricorn ; the corresponding round @xmath2-handles all get attached along disjoint braids ( i.e. the circle attachments can be stacked on top of each other or commuted ) .",
    "this is what we need to be able to apply the move on figure @xmath319 ( i.e. , on all the circles simultaneously , placing them on top of each other and in different parts of the fibers : first two flipping moves , then an isotopy exactly as in the argument in theorem [ connectedness ] .",
    "consequently , we still have circles on the tropic of capricorn , but oriented in the opposite way ( genus increases towards south pole ) , and some lefschetz fibers near the south pole ( created by the flips in figure @xmath319 ) and the previously given lefschetz and anti - lefschetz fibers near the equator .",
    "the latter can now be moved towards the north pole by crossing the circles at tropic of capricorn .",

    "<S> motivated by the programmes initiated by taubes and perutz , we study the geometry of _ near - symplectic _ @xmath0manifolds , i.e. , manifolds equipped with a closed @xmath1form which is symplectic outside a union of embedded @xmath2dimensional submanifolds , and _ broken lefschetz fibrations _ on them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present a set of four moves which allow us to pass from any given broken fibration to any other which is deformation equivalent to it . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we study the change of the near - symplectic geometry under each of these moves . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments rely on the introduction of a more general class of maps , which we call _ wrinkled fibrations _ and which allow us to rely on classical singularity theory . finally , we illustrate these constructions by showing how one can merge components of the zero - set of the near - symplectic form . </S>",
    "<S> we also disprove a conjecture of gay and kirby by showing that any achiral broken lefschetz fibration can be turned into a broken lefschetz fibration by applying a sequence of our moves . </S>"
