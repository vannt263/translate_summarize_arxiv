    "the minimum cutoff is from the c - site .",
    "the peak value of the internal magnetic field comes from the s - site .",
    "contrary to the case for a pure @xmath0-wave superconductor , the sdw order outside the vortex core may have a remarkable contribution to both the internal magnetic distribution and the nmr signal .",
    "it is supposed that @xmath2 nmr experiment can provide direct information on the ldos as the antiferromagnetism spin fluctuation is cancelled  @xcite . from our study",
    ", we find that in the presence of sdw vortex cores , the internal magnetic field on @xmath2 site can not be cancelled exactly and appreciable residue exists .",
    "next , we study the relationship between low energy ldos and nmr signal rate @xmath74 . in a pure @xmath0-wave superconductor(dsc ) , a linear relationship is found between @xmath75 and the ldos @xmath76  @xcite at zero temperature .",

    "our numerical result indicates that the ldos of the low - energy states at the c - site is slightly larger than that of the s - site , although c - site is farther away from the vortex center .",
    "this is different from the work by takigawa _",
    "et al_.  @xcite where the ldos at the s site is found to be larger than that at the c site .",
    "the authors  @xcite there employed the symmetrical gauge and they found that their unit vector of vortex lattice is oriented along @xmath82 from the cu - o bond .",
    "but our result is consistent with the study of knapp _ et al . _",
    "@xcitewho used a different approach and calculated the nmr signal at various sites for a pure dsc .",
    "furthermore , a recent small - angle neutron scattering measurement  @xcite for la@xmath83sr@xmath84cuo@xmath85 indicates that the unit vector of vortex lattice is clearly oriented along the cu - o bonds , consistent with our result in fig .",
    "the nmr experiments  @xcite also show that the nmr signal first decreases as one moves away from the v - site to s - site and then increases at the c - site , consistent with the results in fig .",

    "6 and fig .",
    "it appears that the above analysis could provide a basic understanding of the spatial distribution of the experimentally observed nmr relaxation rates in hts in the framework of pure dsc .",
    "however , it is well known that the theoretical predicted ldos  @xcite , which shows a strong zero energy peak for a pure dsc at the vortex core is in contradictory to the stm measurements  @xcite on hts . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty , the magnetic induced af order has been introduced  @xcite to account for the experiments . in the following",
    "we shall investigate the effect of induced af or sdw order on the nmr theory in hts .",
    "the presence of the induced sdw order in the mixed state may lead to violation of the linear relationship between the ldos at @xmath86=0 and the nmr relaxation rate @xmath87 .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "3 , where we show the spatial images of the ldos ( a ) and the @xmath77 ( b ) according to our numerical calculations for @xmath15=2.4 . there is little resemblance between figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , and the linear relationship does not exists here .",
    "3(a ) indicates that the ldos is smallest at v - site , and largest at s - site , it clearly can not be applied to explain the nmr experiments  @xcite as in the case for a pure dsc .",
    "the spatial distribution images of the ldos at the energy @xmath80 ( a ) and nmr relaxation rate @xmath77 ( b ) in a vortex unit cell for a dsc with induced sdw .",
    "all parameter values are the same as those in fig .",
    "1.,width=325 ]    but the ldos obtained here exhibits no zero energy peak at the vortex core which is consistent with the stm experiments  @xcite .",
    "the averaged ldos of quasiparticles in fig .",
    "3(a)(@xmath15=2.4 ) is greatly suppressed than that in fig .",
    "2(a)(@xmath15=0 ) .",
    "this is because the presence of the induced sdw enhances the insulating nature of the system and thus reduces the number of the quasiparticles .",
    "when @xmath15=2.4 , there are two contributions to the nmr signal @xmath77 , at the low temperature , the dominant one is from the induced sdw order and the minor one is from the low energy quasiparticle states .",
    "the ldos is the smallest at the vortex core center but the sdw order is at its maximum as shown in fig .",
    "1 . from fig .",
    "3(b ) , it is easy to see that the spatially distributed nmr signal @xmath81 which has the largest value at the vortex center because of the induced af order there and decreases along the path ( v@xmath73c@xmath73s ) .",
    "this feature is consistent with what has been observed by the experiments  @xcite and in sharp contrast with takigawa _ et al .",
    "_ s results  @xcite .",
    "they claimed that @xmath1 at v - site is smaller than the neighboring sites and the nmr signal rate at s - site is higher than that of c - site .",
    "the choice of lattice size in their calculations corresponds to a very strong magnetic field at about 51 tesla .",
    "their results seem to be inconsistent with the measurement of @xmath88 on yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the nmr signals also exhibit the temperature t and magnetic field b dependences .",
    "our approach described in section ii is easily extended to study the finite t case , but not the b dependence because weaker b implies larger size calculation which we are not able to do at the present moment .",
    "since the observed nmr signals are coming from the oxygen , copper , or other atoms in hts , here we shall mainly consider the temperature dependence of the nmr signal rate @xmath88 from the @xmath2 sites using eq .",

    "the maximum magnitude of @xmath94 at v - site is about two orders of magnitude larger than that far from the vortex core , and the nmr signal rate at c - site is also larger than that at s - site . because both nmr signals at c and s sites are very weak as compared to that at v site , their distinction is not reflected in fig .",

    "v , the evolution of @xmath1 with temperature exhibits a double peak structure below @xmath3 ; the sharp peak occurs at lower t and the broad peak is at higher t. this is in contrast to a single peak obtained with @xmath15=0 for a pure dsc  @xcite , and it can be clearly seen from the dashed curve below a critical temperature @xmath96 and the solid curve above @xmath4 associated with the v site in fig .",

    "the ldos obtained for a pure dsc  @xcite has a zero energy peak at the core center and this is in contradictory to the stm observations  @xcite .",
    "all these difficulties could somewhat be removed by introducing the field induced sdw pinned at the vortex cores as it has been studied in the present paper . with the induced sdw order ,",
    "the ldos exhibits no zero energy peak at the core center and is consistent with experiments . unlike the case for a pure dsc",
    ", there exists no linear relationship between zero energy ldos and @xmath1 .",
    "we show that sdw order could strongly enhance the nmr signal rate , and as a result , the nmr signal @xmath1 from @xmath2 site has its largest value at the core center v , and smallest value at the saddle point s site ( see figs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the temperature dependent of @xmath1 at v site exhibits a sharp peak at low temperature which is in agreement with the nmr experiments  @xcite . since the strength of the sdw order depends on the magnitude of b , the value of @xmath1",
    "should also be enhanced by increasing b. we also compare @xmath1 from @xmath5 and @xmath2 nuclei at different t and b , their essential features are similar to each other .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath94 outside the vortex core region is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath102 while these two values are closer to each other inside the vortex core .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the difference between our results and those of a similar work  @xcite has been discussed in detail in section iii .",
    "another fundamental difference is that their ldos  @xcite at the vortex center for a pure dsc ( @xmath16 ) shows double peaks near e=0 while only a single peak is obtained in previous  @xciteand present works .",
    "it is our hope that the present calculation may shed more light on the understanding of recent nmr and stm experiments for the mixed state of hts in a unified picture , and stimulate more theoretical activity in this field .",
