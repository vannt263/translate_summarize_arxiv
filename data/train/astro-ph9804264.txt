    "it has been known for some time that the interactions among nucleons in the denser regions can change these opacities significantly , but to date there has been no comprehensive treatment given in the literature and present calculations of the complete supernova process do not include the effects of interactions on the opacities .    the neutrino",

    "this approach is the direct multichannel generalization of the familiar results for light scattering from the thermal density fluctuations in a fluid , where it is the compressibility that determines the long  wavelength opacity , and it was used in references @xcite and @xcite to find significant reductions of neutral  current opacity in certain regions . in burrows & sawyer @xcite , an approach based on ring graphs was used to encompass these results and to extend them to domains in which the equal  time and long  wavelength limits are not clearly applicable .",
    "the use of the equal  time and long  wavelength limits to express correlation functions in terms of static susceptibilities can not be extended to the charged  current interactions when there is a large chemical potential difference between protons and neutrons .",
    "furthermore , there do not exist in the present literature systematic estimates of the effects of interactions on the charged  current opacities for electron neutrinos . in the present work , we give a theoretical framework for addressing these opacities , based on summing ring graphs , together with the results of calculations with input parameters taken from the current phenomenology of nuclear matter .",

    "given this , the full function ( [ 15 ] ) can be verified by checking the analytic properties in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "we look at the results of medium interactions for two sets of conditions typical of the dense interior of a protoneutron star , but at different times ; first for an early time ( @xmath66 seconds ) , when the lepton number is large and second at a later time ( @xmath67 seconds ) , after which the lepton excess has largely radiated away @xcite .",
    "the densities of the various species are such that at zero temperature the inequality @xmath68 holds .",
    "this inequality allows the single nucleon process to proceed at full strength . that is to say , at low temperatures the function im@xmath69 ( [ 13 ] )",
    "is large in the region of @xmath70 defined by the two conditions : 1 ) the neutrino energy , @xmath15 , is near the neutrino fermi surface ; 2 ) the electron energy , @xmath71 , is near the electron fermi surface .",
    "these conditions come from the occupation factors that enter the expression for the total rate .    in this region , we use ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) , and ( [ 10 ] ) to calculate the modification factors in the medium .",
    "we have estimated the contribution of the tensor term ( [ 10 ] ) relative to the two other terms and conclude that it is less than 10% of the total in the cores of protoneutron stars and supernovae . for the vector and axial  vector terms , we compute suppression factors , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , defined as the ratio of the rates calculated with the nuclear interactions to those calculated without .",
    "this is done by substituting ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) into ( [ 5 ] ) , multiplying ( [ 2 ] ) by the neutrino occupation function , and integrating over neutrino energies .",
    "in table 1 , we give results using a post  bounce supernova profile taken from burrows , hayes , & fryxell @xcite . as seen in the table , the gamow ",
    "teller suppression factors are larger than the fermi suppression factors .",
    "furthermore , the degree of many ",
    "body suppression increases with density and decreases with temperature .",
    "importantly , the magnitude of the effect above @xmath74 g @xmath2 is large , ranging from a factor of 2 at @xmath74 g @xmath2 to a factor of @xmath05 near @xmath1 g @xmath2 .",
    "correspondingly , the neutrino  matter absorption cross sections decrease with density .",
    "since it has recently been shown @xcite that the neutral  current scattering rates at high density are also reduced , we conclude that post  bounce supernova cores are significantly more transparent than previously believed .",
    "this enhanced transparency should translate at late times ( @xmath75 ms after bounce ) into higher neutrino luminosities , that thereby may be more efficient at reenergizing or powering a stalled supernova shock @xcite .    integrating equation ( [ 2 ] ) over @xmath76 ,",
    "the distribution of the energy transfer , @xmath9 , to and from the nucleons due to the process @xmath10 in the lepton  rich era can be derived and is depicted in figure 1 for a variety of densities , from @xmath77 g @xmath2 to @xmath78 g @xmath2 . for these curves , the temperature is 5 mev , the electron fraction , y@xmath79 , is 0.26 , the incident electron neutrinos are on their fermi surfaces , and beta equilibrium is assumed .",
    "the highest curve on the right ( that for @xmath80 = @xmath77 g @xmath2 ) ignores many  body effects , though it incorporates the full kinematics , and is included for comparison . as expected , the peak of the energy transfer is generally near @xmath81 ( given in the figure caption ) , since the electron blocking factor in ( [ 2 ] ) puts the electrons on the electron fermi surface and beta equilibrium requires that @xmath82 .",
    "( note that @xmath83 increases with density . )",
    "there is a modest spread in @xmath9 around the peak with approximately a gaussian distribution .",
    "the width of this distribution scales with the temperature .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates what",
    "table 1 also reflects that the total cross sections , the integrals under the unnormalized curves , are decreasing functions of density .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , as the trapped electron lepton number decays , we reach a configuration in which the neutrino absorption process discussed above dies almost completely for low temperatures . at the end of deleptonization ,",
    "we have @xmath84  @xcite . the neutrinos then have thermal energies and we find that the proton fraction has decreased to the point that @xmath85 . in this case",
    "we can not conserve momentum for the three degenerate species , @xmath86 , when the momentum of the neutrino is small and when we stay near the fermi surface for the three other species . at low temperatures ,",
    "the function im@xmath69 of ( [ 13 ] ) is now exponentially small in the region of @xmath70 defined by the leptonic occupancies .",
    "thus , the ring graphs , as defined in the previous section , give a negligible rate for the charged  current processes at low lepton number and temperature .",
    "the other mechanisms that have been used to estimate the rates depend on a spectator nucleon to transfer the necessary momentum , either through a potential or through an assumed correlation @xcite . translated to graphs , these mechanisms involve the estimation of proper graphs for the polarization parts , where a proper graph is defined as a graph that can not be cut into two disjoint parts by severing a single potential line . however , there are  ring corrections \" to such graphs , in which the initial or final current vertices attach to a ring chain that then attaches to the proper polarization graphs .",
    "these ring corrections then have a big suppressive effect on the primary mechanism for momentum transfer , as one can see from the following argument .",
    "we consider a proper polarization graph in which a nucleon  nucleon interaction has intervened to allow momentum conservation near the fermi surfaces .",
    "that is to say , by ( [ 9 ] ) , we have a term for the vector contribution , @xmath27 , to the rate formula ( [ 5 ] ) that has a substantial imaginary part in the kinematically  allowed region .",
    "we call this term , @xmath87 .",

    "similar considerations hold for the axial  vector part . in the lepton ",
    "poor era , we can drop the second term on the rhs of ( [ 5 ] ) , since @xmath9 will be of the order of @xmath61 , rather than of order 100200 mev , as it can be for electron neutrinos in the trapped neutrino era @xcite . then",

    "we take the parameters @xmath97 to be sufficiently small for the integrated suppression factor to be independent of the @xmath98 ^ 2 $ ] that enter through the imaginary parts in the denominator function . in table 2",
    "we give , for the case of matter at nuclear density , the separate suppression factors for the vector and axial  vector rates generated by the uncorrected terms ( [ 17 ] ) , under deleptonized conditions , @xmath99 .",
    "we note that the reductions are substantial , and conclude that the ring corrections should be added to any model that is used for the neutrino opacities during this era .",
    "we have developed a new formalism for incorporating the effects of many  body correlations on the charged  current rates of neutrino  matter interactions .",
    "this formalism reveals that these rates are considerably suppressed in the densest regions of protoneutron stars and supernova cores . assuming that the nucleons are non ",
