    "the information about the space - time structure of the emitting source created in elementary particle and heavy ion collisions from the measured particle momenta can be extracted by the method of two - particle intensity interferometry techniques also called the @xmath2  @xcite which was initially developed to measure the angular size of distant stars  @xcite .",
    "hbt is a useful method to understand the crucial reaction mechanisms of the particle emitting source in relativistic heavy ion collisions , where the quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) is expected to be formed .",
    "experimental search for evidence of qgp is the most fundamental and challenging task in modern nuclear physics .    in this paper , we present the comparative pion intensity interferometry measurements from large collision systems of au+au and cu+cu at @xmath0 = 62.4 and 200 gev with small systems like p+p and d+au at @xmath0 = 200 gev using the solenoidal tracker at rhic(star ) detector at relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic ) . the wealth of new data from star detector with its large acceptance and full azimuth capabilities have provided a new systematic study of the hot and dense medium created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the measured hbt radii are studied as a function of average transverse momentum ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7)@xmath82 ) in 4 bins that correspond to [ 150,250 ] mev / c , [ 250,350 ] mev / c , [ 350,450 ] mev / c and [ 450,600 ] mev / c .",
    "the results are presented and discussed as a function of average @xmath3 ( or @xmath9 = @xmath10 ) in each of those bins .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of hbt radii for all rhic energies in au+au and cu+cu collisions are compared for the first time .",
    "the first measured centrality dependence of hbt radius parameters for cu+cu collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the three hbt radii @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 increase with increasing centrality .",
    "the @xmath12@xmath8@xmath13 ratio @xmath15 1 and exhibits no clear centrality dependence .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the decrease of hbt radii with @xmath11 at all observed centralities is qualitatively consistent with collective flow  @xcite .",
    "the presence of collective flow in the expanding system causes a decrease in `` hbt radii '' with @xmath9  @xcite where the fall - off of `` out '' and `` side '' components is caused by transverse flow  @xcite and for the `` long '' component due to the longitudinal flow  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 parameter increases with @xmath9 as observed in previous star measurements in au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "such increase is due to the decreasing contribution of pions produced from long - lived resonance decays at higher transverse momenta",
    ".    the ratios of transverse and longitudinal hbt radii at top centralities in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev and 62.4 gev is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , from which we infer that the corresponding hbt radii vary similarly with @xmath9 .",
    "the pion freeze - out volume estimates using the hbt radii will provide an understanding of the freeze - out properties .",
    "the freeze - out volume can be estimated using the expressions like :    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the freeze - out volume .",
    "we have discussed in the previous section that the effects of collective expansion of the system lead to the @xmath9 dependence fall - off on hbt radius parameters compared to the measured dimensions of source .",
    "the femtoscopic radii of such an expanding source correspond to the @xmath9(or @xmath3 ) dependent region of homogeneity which is smaller than the entire collision region  @xcite .",
    "henceforth the best volume estimates in eq.([eq : one ] and [ eq : two ] ) are measured for lowest @xmath3 bin which in our case corresponds to [ 150,250]mev / c as described previously .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows the comparative study of freeze - out volume estimates ( using eq.([eq : one ] ) and eq.([eq : two ] ) ) as a function of the number of participants and charge particle multiplicity for au+au collisions , where the earlier measurements at @xmath0 = 200 gev  @xcite are presented with the preliminary star results from 62.4 gev .",
    "measurements of au+au collisions at same centralities and different energies show different freeze - out volume , which means that @xmath1(initial overlap geometry ) is not a suitable scaling variable in this case . on the other hand charge particle multiplicity(final freeze - out geometry )",
    "seems to be a better scaling variable  @xcite .",
    "the study of freeze - out volume estimates are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] for p+p , d+au  @xcite , cu+cu and au+au collisions as a function of charge particle multiplicity . the freeze - out",
    "volume estimates for measured systems show a linear dependence as a function of charge particle multiplicity .",
    "the linear dependence of hbt radii with @xmath20 for all star data - sets is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "such dependences  @xcite are naturally expected within a framework of universal mean - free - path of pions at freeze - out .",

    "studied , the multiplicity and @xmath9(or @xmath3 ) dependence of the radii are strongly consistent with the previously measured colliding systems at rhic . measurements of au+au collisions at same centralities and different energies yield different freeze - out volumes , which infer that @xmath1 is not a suitable scaling variable .",
    "the radii scale with the collision multiplicity ; in a static model , this is consistent with a universal mean - free - path at freeze - out . as in measurements at all other energies  @xcite , the @xmath9(or @xmath3 ) dependence remains independent of @xmath0 , collision system , and multiplicity .",
