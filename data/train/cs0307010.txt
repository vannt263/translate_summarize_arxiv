    "quoting benjamin franklin ( `` nothing is certain but death and taxes '' ) , ginsberg @xcite writes that : `` the view that franklin was expressing is that virtually every conclusion we draw [ in reasoning ] is an uncertain one . ''",
    "he goes on to say : `` this sort of reasoning in the face of uncertainty ... has ... proved to be remarkably difficult to formalise . ''",
    "this article introduces the idea that _ probabilistic reasoning _ ( pr ) may be understood as a process of _ information compression _ ( ic ) by _ multiple alignment _ with _ unification _ and _ search _ ( icmaus ) .",
    "the article is intended as a summary or overview of research which is described in more details elsewhere @xcite . in the space available , it is only possible to present a sketch of the main ideas .",
    "many details are omitted and there is only brief discussion of assumptions and related issues .    in the icmaus framework , _ multiple alignment _ ( ma ) has a meaning which is similar to but distinct from its meaning in bio - informatics while _ unification _ means a simple merging of matching patterns , a meaning which is related to but simpler than the meaning of that term in logic .",
    "the term search in this context means the systematic exploration of the abstract space of possible alignments , normally constrained in some way ( using heuristic techniques or otherwise ) to achieve useful results in realistic timescales .    in this article ,",
    "the way in which the ic associated with any alignment may be calculated is described in outline together with a brief description of sp61 , a software model designed to discover and construct mas which are ` good ' in terms of ic .",
    "more detail may be found in @xcite .    with examples from the sp61 model",
    ", the main body of the article presents an overview of how the icmaus framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of pr including :    * best - match pattern recognition and information retrieval .",
    "* inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy .",
    "* one - step ` deductive ' and ` abductive ' reasoning .",
    "* chains of reasoning : * * reasoning with probabilistic decision networks and decision trees . * * reasoning with ` rules ' . * reasoning with default values . * nonmonotonic reasoning .",
    "* solving geometric analogy problems .",
    "* icmaus as a possible alternative to bayesian networks .",
    "topics which are discussed in @xcite but are omitted from this article include : recognition of patterns with internal structure ( illustrated with an example of medical diagnosis ) ; multiple inheritance ; and the recognition of polythetic categories .",
    "topics which are discussed in @xcite but omitted here include : modelling of ` variables ' with ` values ' and ` types ' ; hypothetical ( `` what if '' ) reasoning ; indirection in information retrieval ; and the representation of knowledge in the icmaus framework .    for the sake of clarity and to save space , the examples presented in section [ patt - recognition ] and the following sections are relatively small . however , the sp61 model is capable of handling more complicated examples as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the scaling properties of the model are good ( see section [ comp - complexity ] ) .",
    "the proposals in these articles have been developed within a programme of research developing the ` sp ' conjecture that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ all kinds of computing and formal reasoning may usefully be understood as information compression by multiple alignment , unification and search , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and developing a ` new generation ' computing system based on this thinking .",
    "background thinking for this research programme is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to pr , the concepts have so far been developed in relation to the following fields : _ best - match information retrieval and pattern recognition _",
    "@xcite ; _ parsing of natural language _ @xcite ; and _ automation of software design and the execution of software functions _ @xcite .    although the icmaus framework has not yet been developed for learning , the entire programme of research is based on earlier research on _ unsupervised inductive learning _ @xcite which is itself based on principles of minimum length encoding ( mle , see @xcite ) .",
    "a preliminary account of the icmaus framework and its range of applications in learning and reasoning was presented in @xcite at a stage before a working model had been developed or the concepts had been quantified .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the icmaus framework provides an interpretation in terms of ic of the post canonical system and universal turing machine models of computing .",
    "there is now a huge literature on pr and related ideas ranging over ` standard ' parametric and non - parametric statistics ; _ ad hoc _ uncertainty measures in early expert systems ; bayesian statistics ; bayesian / belief / causal networks ; markov networks ; self - organising feature maps ; fuzzy set theory and ` soft ' computing ; the dempster - shaffer theory ; abductive reasoning ; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values ; autoepistemic logic , defeasible logic , probabilistic , possibilistic and other kinds of logic designed to accommodate uncertainty ; mle ; algorithmic probability and algorithmic complexity theory ; truth maintenance systems ; decision analysis ; utility theory ; and so on .    a well - known authoritative survey of the field , with an emphasis on bayesian networks , is provided by judea pearl @xcite although this book is now , perhaps , in need of some updating .",
    "a useful review from the same year is @xcite .",
    "a more recent collection of articles , which together provide a broad coverage of the subject , appears in @xcite .",
    "a relatively short but useful review of `` uncertainty handling formalisms '' is provided by @xcite .",
    "regarding the application of different kinds of ` logic ' to nonmonotonic and uncertain reasoning , there is a mine of useful information in the articles in @xcite covering such things as ` default logic ' , ` autoepistemic logic ' , ` circumscription ' , ` defeasible logic ' , ` uncertainty logics ' and ` possibilistic logic ' . in that volume",
    ", the chapter by ginsberg @xcite provides an excellent introduction to the problems of nonmonotonic reasoning .",
    "papers by @xcite are also relevant as are the papers in @xcite .",
    "naturally enough , much of the literature on probabilistic reasoning deals directly with concepts of probability , especially conditional probability .",
    "since , however , there is a close connection between probability and compression ( mediated by coding schemes such as the huffman coding scheme - see , for example , @xcite - or the shannon - fano - elias coding scheme , _",
    "ibid_. ) , concepts of probability imply corresponding concepts of compression .",
    "that said , a primary emphasis on compression rather than probability provides an alternative perspective on the subject which may prove useful .",
    "relevant sources include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the term _ multiple alignment _ is normally associated with the computational analysis of ( symbolic representations of ) sequences of dna bases or sequences of amino acid residues as part of the process of elucidating the structure , functions or evolution of the corresponding molecules .",
    "the aim of the computation is to find one or more alignments of matching symbols in two or more sequences which are , in some sense , ` good ' .",
    "possible meanings for that term are discussed in section [ eval - align ] , below .",
    "an example of an alignment of dna sequences is shown in figure [ dna ] .    ....",

    "heuristic techniques include ` hill climbing ' ( sometimes called ` descent ' ) , ` beam search ' , ` genetic algorithms ' , ` simulated annealing ' , ` dynamic programming ' and others . with these techniques ,",
    "searching is done in stages , with a progressive narrowing of the search in successive stages using some kind of measure of goodness of alignments to guide the search .",
    "these techniques may be described generically as ` metrics - guided search ' .    with these techniques ,",
    "ideal solutions can not normally be guaranteed but acceptably good approximate solutions can normally be found without excessive computational demands .",
    "there is now a fairly large literature about methods for finding good alignments amongst two or more sequences of symbols .",
    "some of the existing methods are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "because of the way in which the concept of ma has been generalised in this research ( see next ) , none of the current methods for finding mas are suitable for incorporation in the proposed sp system . hence the development of a new method , outlined in section [ generalisation ]",
    ".      in this research , the concept of ma has been generalised in the following way :    1 .",
    "one ( or more ) of the sequences of symbols to be aligned has a special status and is designated as ` new ' . the way in which the concept of ` new ' appears to relate to established concepts in computing",
    "is shown in table [ new - old ] .",
    "all other sequences are designated as ` old ' .",
    "the way in which the concept of ` old ' appears to relate to established concepts in computing is also shown in table [ new - old ] .",
    "a ` good ' alignment is one which , through the unification of symbols in new with symbols in old , and through unifications amongst the symbols in old , leads to a relatively large amount of compression of new in terms of the sequences in old .",
    "how this may be done is explained in section [ eval - align ] , below .",
    "an implication of this way of framing the alignment problem is that , by contrast with ` multiple alignment ' as normally understood in bio - informatics , any given sequence in old may appear two or more times in any one alignment and may therefore be aligned with itself ( with the obvious restriction that any one instance of a symbol may * not * be aligned with itself ) .",
    ", it is obviously possible to include two or more _ copies _ of a given sequence in any one alignment . to my knowledge , this is never done in practice because it would simply lead to the trivial alignment of each symbol in one copy with the corresponding symbol or symbols in one or more other copies .",
    "what is proposed for the icmaus framework is different : any _ one _ pattern may appear two or more times in an alignment .",
    "each appearance is just that - it is an _ appearance _ of _ one _ pattern , not a duplicate _ copy _ of a pattern .",
    "since each appearance of a pattern represents the same pattern , it makes no sense to match a symbol from one appearance with the corresponding symbol in another appearance because this is simply matching one instance of the symbol with itself .",
    "any such match is spurious and must be forbidden . ]",
    ".the way in which the concepts of ` new ' and ` old ' in this research appear to relate to established concepts in computing .",

    "in this article , i have outlined the concept of _ information compression by multiple alignment , unification and search _ as it has been developed in this research program and , with examples , have tried to show how the icmaus paradigm may provide a framework within which various kinds of probabilistic reasoning may be understood . substantially more detail about these ideas may be found in @xcite .",
