    "a robust prediction of inflationary scenarios is that the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are expected to obey gaussian statistics .",
    "actually this prediction has been challenged recently by several authors ( falk , rangarajan & srednicki 1993 , munshi , souradeep & starobinsky 1995 ) who calculated the skewness induced by nonlinear couplings in the primary stage of the temperature fluctuation generation .",
    "the skewness induced at this level has been found , however , to be entirely negligible compared to the cosmic variance , and thus not accessible to detections .",
    "therefore , the primary temperature maps are entirely defined , in a statistical sense , by the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations or equivalently by the shape of the two - point correlation function . a number of other statistical indicators are thus set up by this a priori hypothesis .",
    "in particular bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) have investigated expected properties of such temperature maps , as the number density of temperature peaks , their correlation functions ... moreover , the exploration of the cmb physics has been boosted recently after it has been realized that it would be possible to determine all the cosmological parameters with a remarkable precision from an accurate , and accessible , measurement of the temperature power spectrum ( jungman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , the effects of the secondary sources of temperature fluctuations ( sunyaev - zeldovich effects , nonlinear doppler effects , lenses .. ) and foregrounds ( point sources , galactic dust ) on the power spectrum have been investigated in more details ( see cobras / samba report , 1996 , for a general discussion on these problems ) . these calculations have shown that most , if not all , of these effects have a relatively small impact on it . in these calculations , however , the impact of secondary effects on the gaussian nature of the temperature field has not been considered .",
    "particularly interesting are the the higher order correlation functions that are identically zero for gaussian fields , and are thus direct indicators of any , even small , non - gaussian features .    in this paper the calculations will be focused on the effects of weak - lensing on cmb maps .",
    "they , indeed , constitute a particularly attractive mechanism because it comes from a _ coupling _ between the primary temperature fluctuation field and the mass concentration on the line of sight acting as deflectors .",
    "their impact on the power spectrum has been investigated primarily by blanchard & schneider , ( 1987 ) who found the effect to be negligible .",
    "more recent works ( kashlinsky 1988 , cole & efstathiou 1989 , sasaki 1989 , tomita & watanabe 1989 , linder 1990 , cayn , martnez - gonzlez & sanz 1993a , b , fukushige , makino & ebisuzaki 1994 , seljak 1996 ) eventually confirmed this conclusion , although the point was debated for a while . in particular seljak ( 1996 ) made a detailed calculations of these effects for realistic models of cmb anisotropies and using a semi - analytic calculation based on a power spectrum approach that includes nonlinear corrections . in this text",
    "i will follow a rather similar approach to investigate the apparition of non - gaussian features caused by weak lensing effects .",
    "in section 2 , i present the basis of the physical mechanisms describing the cmb map deformations induced by weak lensing effects . in section 3 ,",
    "i give the explicit expression of the first non - vanishing correlation function , the four - point , in different remarkable geometries . in section 4 , quantitative predictions",
    "are given for two different cosmological models .",
    "the dependence of the results on the cosmological parameters , and the practical interests that such a measurement could have , are discussed in the last section .",
    "the effect of a gravitational lens is to induce a displacement of the light path , thus moving the apparent position of a sky patch on the last scattering surface by a given angle .",
    "the temperature of this patch is not affected itself , i.e. lenses do not created new structures , and a perfectly isotropic sky would remain so .",
    "the patch of the sky observed at the position @xmath0 is thus actually coming from the position @xmath1 on the `` primordial sky '' , and the displacement , @xmath2 , is induced by the mass concentration on the line of sight .",
    "more precisely @xmath2 is given by the transverse derivative of the projected potential @xmath3 of the mass fluctuations , & ( ) - ( ) + = & , where @xmath4 is the angular distance , @xmath5 is the distance of the lenses along the line of sight and @xmath6 is the distance of the last scattering surface ( see kaiser 1992 , seljak 1996 , bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1996 for more details on this equation ) .",
    "it is interesting to rewrite this equation in terms of the fourier transform of the _ mass density fluctuation _ field .",
    "the fourier transforms @xmath7 are defined by , ( , ) =  d_+ ( )  ( ) + , [ dk ] where the linear growth factor @xmath8 and the fourier transforms are normalized to the present time .",
    "then the potential reads , & ( , ) = _ 0   + & which implies that the displacement can be written , & = [ dgam ] + &  ( ) , with w()=3_0 .[eff ] the function @xmath9 gives the efficiency function of lenses for sources located on the last scattering surface .",
    "it will be investigated in more details in the last section .",
    "note that in the following i will amply use the small angle approximation .",
    "it implies in particular that a given patch of the sky can be decomposed in flat waves and also that , in moment calculations , the component of @xmath10 along the line of sight can be neglected compared to the norm of @xmath11 .      compared to detections on background galaxies ,",
    "the investigation of lens effects on the last scattering surface is very attractive , because this surface is at a well defined redshift , and has a negligible width .",
    "the analysis of the lens effects requires however more sophisticated tools since the induced shear can not be directly measured .",
    "the primordial temperature patches on the cmb sky are indeed known only statistically and have a large angular correlation length . in which way , then , can the lens effects be revealed ?",
    "actually lensed cmb maps can be seen as collections of temperature patches of different sizes and shapes , which or only a fraction of which are displaced or deformed .",
    "although this is slightly arbitrary , two effects can be distinguished in the way sizes and shapes of patches are affected ,    * the _ shear _ effect that deforms , stretches out temperature patches in the shear direction , * the _ magnification _ effect that globally enlarges or shrinks those patches .",
    "the local deformations of the temperature patches are however a priori difficult to disentangle from the actual primordial intrinsic temperature fluctuations .",
    "what will make then the effects detectable is the fact that _ close _ patches will be deformed in a _ similar _",
    "way ( when they are seen through a unique lens ) , and the excess of these close rare features can not be accounted from a gaussian field .",
    "it is thus possible to quantify their presence by statistical indicators .",
    "the power spectrum is of course not adapted to take into account the apparition of such non - gaussian features . for that matter",
    "the high - order correlation functions , that are all identically zero for pure gaussian fields , are extremely precious .",
    "indeed these higher - order correlation functions contain informations about shapes , and their derivations can be pursued completely with perturbation theory techniques . in the following i focus my analysis on the first non vanishing correlation function , the four - point one",
    "from the first equation it is easy to see that the temperature , @xmath12 , observed in the direction @xmath13 is in fact the unaffected temperature @xmath14 coming from a slightly changed direction , ( ) = ( ) = ( + ) .[dto ] in the following i assume that the displacement is small compared to the angular scale at which the observations are made .",
    "this is a fair assumption since the displacement is at most of @xmath15 ( for cores of clusters ) and that the angular resolution of the future satellite missions does not go below @xmath16 . as a result",
    "it is always possible to expand the relation ( [ dto ] ) with respect to the displacement , ( ) & = ( ) + ( ) _ i+ + & ( ) _ i_j+  [exp ] where the einstein index summation prescription is used .",
    "it is important to have in mind that both quantities @xmath17 and @xmath2 are _ independent _ gaussian fields .",
    "the primordial temperature field is gaussian for inflationary scenario , and independent of the lens potential field because the last scattering surface is far from the intervening lenses ( that will be found to be at redshift @xmath18 ) .",
    "the lens potential field will be assumed to be in the linear regime , although this is not a crucial hypothesis .    in the following the correlation functions or moments",
    "will be calculated in the small angle approximation , for which the plane approximation for the last scattering surface can be made .",
    "thus one can write , ( ) = a_l ( ) , where the @xmath19 coefficients obey gaussian statistical rules . in particular , a_la_l=_dirac(+ )  c_l,[powl ] where the @xmath20 are the `` famous '' @xmath20 describing the angular power spectrum .",
    "on the other hand the random variables @xmath7 obey the statistics , ( ) ( )=_dirac(+)p(k),[powk ] where @xmath21 is normalized to the present day . in order to produce a consistent set of power spectra",
    "it is important to have a consistent normalization for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this can be obtained from the small @xmath22 behavior of @xmath20 corresponding to the small @xmath23 behavior of @xmath21 . in",
    "the following i will assume an harrison - zeldovich initial spectrum , so that , p(k)=a  k  at  small  k. the coefficient @xmath24 can be related to the small @xmath22 behavior of @xmath22 ( see hu 1995 for instance ) , l(l+1)c_l=_0 ^ 2  at  small  l. [ norm ]      the dominant corrective term for the angular two - point correlation function can be calculated from the expansion ( [ exp ] ) , & ( _ 1)(2)= ( _ 1)(2)+[corr2 ] + & ( _ 1)_i(_1 )   ( _ 2)_j(_2 ) + + & ( _ 1 ) ( _ 2)_i(_2)_j(_2)+  the corrective terms have been written up to the quadratic term in the large - scale structure density field .",
    "the previous expression can be written in fourier space , & ( _ 1)(2)= + & + &   p(k )   + & where @xmath25 is the angular distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "this formula has been obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ powl],[powk ] ) defining the two power spectra . to complete the calculations one can use the small - angle approximation , well verified below @xmath29 degree scale , which implies that kk _  and  p(k)p(k _ ) .",
    "then the integral over @xmath30 leads to a dirac function in @xmath31 .",
    "we eventually have , & ( _ 1)(2)=c(_12)+ + &  w^2 ( ) p(k ) + & , with c()=.[cgam ] this result does not coincide apparently with the one of seljak ( 1996 , equation a.6 ) , but simply because the exponential was not expanded in his expression .",
    "that this expansion can be done is amply justified by the fact that the displacements are small compared to the angular resolution scale .",
    "then one recovers exactly the same expression .",
    "note that the autocorrelation function of the displacement field is automatically introduced by the third term in ( [ corr2 ] ) .",
    "it is quite easy to see that the weak - lensing effects do not introduce a three - point correlation function .",
    "it is indeed impossible to build a term of non - zero ensemble average involving three @xmath19 factors .",
    "the first non trivial high order correlation function is thus the four - point correlation function . at this stage",
    "it is important to have in mind that the observable quantity is the _ connected _ part , @xmath32 , of the ensemble average , @xmath33 , that is the part which is obtained when the products of two point correlation functions that can be built have been subtracted out , & + & - + & - + & perm .",
    "( 2  other  terms).the connected part is obviously zero for the primordial field : it is a direct consequence of its gaussian nature . the dominant term , in terms of weak lensing effects ,",
    "is thus given by , & [ expc4 ] + & ( _ 1 )   ( _ 2)_i(_2 )  _ j(_3 ) + & ( _ 3 )   ( _ 4)+perm .",
    "( 11  other  terms).roughly speaking it means that the four - point correlation function , in units of the square of the second , is proportional to the weak lensing angular correlation function .",
    "although at this stage it is difficult to give definitive quantitative predictions , the magnitude of the fourth order correlation function should be about @xmath34 ( the order of the corrective term in [ [ corr2 ] ] ) , which should be easily detectable in full sky coverage cmb maps .",
    "the expression of the four - point correlation function can be given in terms of the power spectra , & ( _ 1)(_2)(_3)(_4)_c= + & + & + + & perm .",
    "( 11  other  terms).this expression can be calculated with an integration over the angles between @xmath35 and @xmath25 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "it yields the bessel functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the results can thus be expressed in terms of the angular derivative of the two - point correlation function , c()=- c_lj_1(l ) , and with quantities associated with the angular correlation of the displacement field , d_p()=   , [ dp ] leading to ( appendix a ) , & ( _ 1)(_2)(_3)(_4)_c= + & + & + + & +  perm .",
    "( 11  other  terms),[corr4]where @xmath40 is the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath41and @xmath42 is the angle between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . two terms are thus involved .",
    "the a priori dominant term is the one in @xmath45 , and it is weighted by the cosine of the angle @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , that is the angle between the directions @xmath25 and @xmath37 on the sky . it gives a clear geometrical dependence for the four point - correlation function .",
    "however , one should have in mind that 11 other terms have to be taken into account in this calculation",
    ". this signal may therefore be masked by other geometric dependences .",
    "quantitative calculations can be done for specific cosmological models ( see next section ) . however , one obvious problem for a practical determination of this correlation function is that it depends on 5 different variables .",
    "it is thus crucial to reduce the number of variables by considering simplified geometries .        the first geometry one may think of is when two points are merged together , that is the expression of @xmath47 ^ 2\\,\\dto(\\gam_3)\\md_c$ ] .",
    "this notation is actually a bit oversimplified since the local temperature fluctuations are actually filtered by the used apparatus .",
    "one should thus have in mind that the two directions denoted @xmath27 are actually close random directions in a beam centered on @xmath27 .",
    "of course , once again , many terms are contributing to this ensemble average but i will first concentrate on the case where the connection between the two @xmath48 is made by the lens coupling term ( subsection a.2.b ) . in such a case",
    "one can see that @xmath49 is given by the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 and is not affected by the smoothing .",
    "this is not the case for the term in @xmath52 which is expected to vanish because it is averaged to zero ( more precise derivations are given in the appendix ) .",
    "this contribution is thus proportional to the cosine of the angle , and to the autocorrelation function of the displacement field .",
    "what about the other terms ? their geometrical representations are given in fig .",
    "the ( 2a ) diagram is the term that has just been considered and is expected to dominate the final expression .",
    "note that all these diagrams have a symmetry factor of 2 compared to what is given in the appendix . at first view",
    "the ( 2b ) diagram vanishes because @xmath40 takes a random value averaging both @xmath53 and @xmath52 to zero .",
    "a more detailed calculation is proposed in the appendix .",
    "it shows that it gives a contribution proportional to the angular correlation function of the local weak lensing convergence ( see blandford et al .",
    "1991 , villumsen 1996 , bernardeau et al .",
    "1996 ) , m_0()=. the two other diagrams are simpler since they can be simply obtained from the general expression ( [ corr4 ] ) .",
    "taking all these terms into account we have , & ( _ 1)^2(_3)_c [ g1k ] + & + & + + & c(_12)c(_23 ) ( ) + & where @xmath54 is shown on fig .",
    "( 2b ) ( @xmath55 corresponds to the diagram obtained when the roles of @xmath26 and @xmath56 are inverted ) and @xmath57 is the smoothing angle of the experiment .",
    "in this expression , the @xmath58 terms have been neglected , @xmath45 has been changed in @xmath59 for diagram ( 2a ) and @xmath60 in @xmath61 in ( 2b ) .",
    "this is due to the filtering effects .",
    "one should indeed take into account the average displacement within the beam size of the experiment in the first case , the rms temperature fluctuations in the second .",
    "more precisely we have , _ 0()=   , [ db0 ] and ( ) = , with , for a top - hat window function for instance , w(x)=.    it is then interesting to define the function , &",
    "_ 4(_12,_23)=[k4g2 ] + & , which is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "it does not depend in particular on the magnitude of the cmb temperature fluctuations and it is directly proportional to the large - scale structure power spectrum , with a known dependence on the shape of the anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "this quantity would thus be a measure the weak lensing effects in cmb maps .",
    "taking into account the fact that the diagram ( 2b ) generally leads to a negligible contribution we have , & _",
    "4(_12,_23)[k4g2e ] + & ( ) + & .a 2d contour plot of the function @xmath62 is proposed in fig . 6 for a peculiar cosmological case .",
    "the main contribution to this expression is the term coming from the diagram ( 2a ) , but the contributions from ( 2c ) and",
    "( 2d ) can not be neglected because the correlation function of the displacement field @xmath45 is only slowly decreasing with the angle ( see next section ) .",
    "it is interesting to have in mind the physical effect described by this result .",
    "it corresponds indeed to a shear effect that is the _ deformation of two nearby temperature patches by a single lens_. it can thus be seen as the excess of close temperature peaks that are elongated in the _ same _ direction .",
    "it is therefore logical that this effect is proportional to the correlation function of the displacement field .",
    "however , it does not always dominated the four point correlation function .",
    "this is the case in particular at the degree scale since the derivative of the temperature correlation function vanishes ( see fig . 4 in the next section ) .",
    "the next subsection is devoted to a simpler geometry where this case is more specifically investigated .",
    "this case is obtained from the previous case when the directions @xmath56 and @xmath63 coincide .",
    "the geometrical representations of the involved terms are presented in fig .",
    "the a priori dominant term corresponds to the diagram ( 3b ) .",
    "however , as noted previously , both the diagrams ( 3b ) and ( 3c ) vanish for specific values of the distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in such a case we are left with the diagram ( 3a ) .",
    "a crude evaluation of this diagram gives zero because the averages over the angles @xmath40 and @xmath42 are expected to vanish .",
    "however this is true only when the smoothing angle is negligible compared to the angular distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "more precise calculations ( subsection a.3 ) show that this term is proportional to the logarithmic derivative of the temperature variance in the beam .",
    "the resulting value of the correlation function is ( taking into account a symmetry factor of 4 ) , & ^2 ^ 2_c [ g2k ] + &   m_0(_12)+ + & .note that the first term is no more proportional to the angular correlation of the displacement field , but to the angular correlation of the convergence ( that is , within a factor 2 , of the magnification in the weak lensing regime ) . here",
    "the physical mechanism has changed .",
    "the correlation function is not due to a local shear , but to single lens amplification of patches on the primordial sky that create an _ excess of close bright peaks_. it is thus clearly a magnification effect .      the last case i consider is when the four directions coincide . in this case",
    "the magnification effect always dominates and the results , obtained in subsection a.4 , are similar to the one discussed in the previous subsection , but with small changes introduced by the filtering effects , ^4_c=34  0b(_0 ) with 0b(_0)=. this result has been properly demonstrated for a top - hat window function , and should be roughly correct for other window functions . note that this expression is also the fourth cumulant of the local filtered temperature probability distribution function",
    "we can as well define the dimensionless quantity , _",
    "4(_0)= 0b(_0)[k4pdf ] which tells us that _ the dimensionless kurtosis of the local filtered cmb temperature probability distribution function is proportional to the variance of the local filtered convergence .",
    "the cosmological models used to illustrate the previous results by quantitative predictions are standard cdm models with @xmath64 , @xmath65mpc with an initial harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "two cases have been chosen , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( model 1 ) and @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( model 2 ) .",
    "the transfer function and temperature power spectrum were both computed with the code of seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .    for convenience",

    "they exhibit a remarkable property , since they both drop to zero at a scale slightly larger than 1 degree .",
    "this property can be of great help to disentangle various contributions .",
    "for instance it implies that specific geometries produce a vanishing four - point correlation function .",
    "this is the case for instance when three of the four directions form an equilateral triangle with @xmath73 of side length .",
    "such a property could be of crucial interest to ascertain the origin of an observed four - point correlation function .",
    "the two other quantities of interest are the functions @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( eqs . [ dp ] , [ db0 ] ) that describe the magnitude of the lens effects .",

    "it exhibits specific features induced by the @xmath78 factor and by the derivative of the temperature angular correlation function .",
    "the fact that the latter vanishes is clearly present with a significant circular feature at 1 degree scale .",
    "it implies that the kurtosis is maximum for angular distances below 1 degree .",
    "note that in this figure , all contributions have been included , but the contributions from ( 2b ) are found to be negligible and not to affect the global features of this plot .",
    "i also present the quantities intervening in the expression of the dimensionless kurtosis of the cmb temperature pdf .",
    "the index of the local temperature fluctuations is given in fig .",
    "7 for the two cosmological models .",
    "the variance of the convergence is presented in fig .",
    "8 , and the resulting value of @xmath79 in fig . 9 .",
    "the resulting coefficient @xmath79 can be as high as @xmath80 .",
    "it depends however a lot on the cosmological models and more particularly on the amount of power at about @xmath81mpc scale .",
    "the reason why @xmath82 , and consequently @xmath79 , is smaller for the @xmath83 case is thus actually due to the change of shape of @xmath21 ( i.e. , a lower value of @xmath84 ) , and not directly to the low value of @xmath85 .",
    "the dependence on the cosmological parameters is investigated in more details in the next subsection .",
    "the dependence on the cosmological parameters enters in various aspects .",
    "it is important in particular for the relation between the @xmath20 and the mass fluctuation power spectrum @xmath21 .",
    "this is not the aim of this paper to explore in great details all these dependences .",
    "there is however a dependence which is specific of the lens effects , that is the shape of the efficiency function @xmath86 ( eq . [ eff ] ) . in fig .",
    "10 , i present the function @xmath86 for different cosmological models .",
    "we can see that both the shape and the amplitude of this function strongly depend on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the main dependence is actually due to the factor @xmath85 appearing in the expression of @xmath86 .",
    "this is however quite misleading since this factor cancels out with the one intervening in the expression of the normalization factor @xmath24 ( eq . [ vala ] ) .",
    "the dependence on the cosmological parameters is thus mainly contained in the shape of the power spectrum , that is in the ratio between the amount of power at relatively small scale to the power at very large scale , although they enter significantly in the efficiency function @xmath86 , even when the overall @xmath85 factor has been dropped .",
    "the way the two cosmological parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 enter in this expression is unfortunately rather cumbersome .",
    "it is however clear that the cmb four - point correlation function contains informations on the cosmological parameters in a quite different combination compared to the one intervening in the temperature power spectrum .",
    "in particular the detection of such an affect may allow to better disentangle what is specific of @xmath20 from what contribute directly to @xmath21 .",
    "in this work , i have calculated the expression of the four - point temperature correlation function as induced by weak - lensing effects . for standard cdm model , the amplitude of this correlation function , in units of the square of the second ,",
    "is found to be of order of @xmath80 .",
    "however , this estimation did not take into account the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum that might significantly amplify this signal at small angular scale .",
    "this is for instance what is predicted for the two - point correlation function of the polarization of background galaxies ( jain & seljak 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of cmb maps , the scale at which this effect might appear can not be deduced straightforwardly from this work .",
    "this effect is indeed the result of a line of sight integration that mix different scales and different redshifts for a given selection function ( e.g. fig .",
    "10 ) which is itself dependent on the redshift of the sources",
    ". moreover all the intervening quantities have non trivial dependences on the cosmological parameters that should be taken into account . a detailed examination of the nonlinear effects",
    "is then left for a forthcoming paper .",
    "i would like to stress , that the amplitude of the lensing effects should be large enough to be detectable , at least marginally , in full sky cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "the possibility of doing such measurements is directly related to the cosmic noise associated with the quantities of interest , fourth moment or four - point correlation function .",
    "so far , no precise estimation of the cosmic noise for the four - point correlation function has been made , but following srednicki ( 1993 ) , who presented the calculation for the three - point correlation function , one expects the cosmic variance of those quantities to be of the order of @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the typical value of @xmath22 contributing to the temperature fluctuations .",
    "one can observe that the value of @xmath89 is of the order of the signal , however , one should have in mind that a direct and too naive calculation of the cosmic noise may be actually misleading since the long wavelength fluctuations ( corresponding to the low @xmath22 part of the power spectrum ) contribute significantly to it , whereas the lensing signal originates mainly from the small angular scales ( below 1 degree ) .",
    "it suggests that the weak lensing signal might be more easily detectable in maps where the long wavelength temperature fluctuations have been removed .",
    "moreover the detailed methods used to extract the signal might also be of different robustness against the cosmic noise .",
    "in particular , it could be fruitful to take advantage of the a priori knowledge of the geometrical dependence of the four - point correlation function ( see for example the @xmath91 factor in the expression [ [ k4g2e ] ] ) . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we explore the different possible strategies for the data analysis , and will present detailed estimations of the precision at which such a detection could be made in the future satellite missions .",
    "it also has to be noted that other secondary effects or foregrounds may also contribute to the four - point correlation function , not to mention the case of more exotic cosmological models based on intrinsically non - gaussian topological defects .",
    "in particular the nonlinear doppler effects could induce a significant four - point correlation function , because it is caused by intrinsically non - gaussian objects .",
    "there are however no reasons for these effects to have the same geometrical dependences , @xmath78 factor and dependence on the shape of the temperature two - point correlation function .",
