    "a coxeter polytope in hyperbolic space is a convex fundamental domain for reflection group , i.e. a polytope whose all dihedral angles are integer parts of @xmath2 . for a compact hyperbolic coxeter polytope @xmath3",
    "we denote by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the dimension , the number of codimension one faces ( _ facets _ in the sequel ) , ans the number of pairs of disjoint facets respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 be the set of polytopes satisfying the following condition :    @xmath8    the set @xmath7 is finite .",
    "all polytopes of this set can be listed by a finite algorithm provided in section  [ algorithm ] .    in general ,",
    "the number of compact hyperbolic coxeter polytopes is infinite . in  @xcite ,",
    "makarov constructed infinite series of polytopes in dimensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in  @xcite",
    ", allcock used the @xmath0-dimensional polytope constructed by bugaenko  @xcite to present an infinite series of @xmath0-polytopes .",
    "another source of examples is given by right - angled compact coxeter polytopes , they exist in hyperbolic spaces of dimension at most @xmath9 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "recently nikulin  @xcite and agol , belolipetsky , storm , whyte  @xcite proved that the number of maximal arithmetic hyperbolic reflection groups is finite .",
    "a similar statement concerning general reflection groups does not hold : examples by makarov provide fundamental domains of infinite number of non - commensurable reflection groups .",
    "however , all known examples of infinite series of polytopes ( in dimension at least @xmath9 ) can be obtained from a finite number of polytopes by a composition of two operations : taking a fundamental domain of a finite index reflection subgroup of the corresponding reflection group , or gluing two coxeter polytopes along congruent facets .",
    "this gives rise to a notion of _ essential _ hyperbolic coxeter polytope which is minimal with respect to operations above ( see section  [ essential ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "a classification problem of compact hyperbolic coxeter polytopes can be easily reduced to a classification of essential polytopes .    in dimensions",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 compact hyperbolic coxeter polytopes are completely classified by poincar  @xcite and andreev  @xcite , so in this paper we restrict our attention to polytopes in the spaces of dimension at least @xmath9 . as we have mentioned above",
    ", the number of known essential compact hyperbolic coxeter polytopes is finite ( all known polytopes can be obtained by gluing several copies of finite number of polytopes ) .",
    "moreover , all polytopes of dimension greater than five that are known to be essential belong to @xmath7 . in section  [ essential ] we discuss properties of essential polytopes and present a list of them .",
    "while proving that a polytope is essential , the main tool is the result of  @xcite which , roughly speaking , states that gluing operations can not decrease the number of facets .",
    "a possible counterpart of the result by nikulin and agol , belolipetsky , storm , whyte in non - arithmetic case whould be a finiteness of the number of essential polytopes , which we conjecture in section  [ essential ] .",
    "all the remaining sections are devoted to the proof of the main theorem . here",
    "the plan of the proof is .",
    "first , we split the set of polytopes @xmath7 in the following way : @xmath13 where @xmath14 consists of polytopes from @xmath7 of dimension @xmath4 with @xmath5 facets .",
    "further , each @xmath14 can be presented as @xmath15 where @xmath16 consists of polytopes from @xmath14 with dihedral angles not less than @xmath17 .    for given @xmath18 and @xmath19 there are finitely many combinatorial types of polytopes and finitely many ways to assign angles between facets , which implies that @xmath16 is finite due to the following fact proved by andreev  @xcite : an acute - angled polytope @xmath3 is completely determined by its dihedral angles .",
    "our aim is to prove that for given @xmath4 and @xmath5 the set @xmath16 is empty for large @xmath19 ( which will imply that @xmath14 is finite ) , we do it in section  [ multiplicity ] .",
    "the key tool here is the trick allowing us to reduce dimension .",
    "it is based on the following result due to borcherds  @xcite : if a face @xmath20 of codimension @xmath11 is an intersection of two facets composing a dihedral angle less than @xmath21 , then @xmath20 itself is a coxeter polytope .",
    "then we show ( section  [ fin ] ) that for given @xmath4 the set @xmath14 is empty for large @xmath5 ( which will imply that @xmath22 is finite ) . in  @xcite , vinberg proved that the dimension of a compact hyperbolic coxeter polytope does not exceed @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we need to consider sets @xmath22 for a finite number of dimensions only , so @xmath7 is finite .    in section  [ cox ]",
    "we recall basic facts about coxeter polytopes and their facets , and reproduce the notation introduced in  @xcite ; in section  [ tools ] we describe the technique of local determinants and prove several technical lemmas . in section  [ algorithm ]",
