    "this completes the induction step .    under the restrictions established in proposition  [ prop1 ] ,",
    "the determining system ( [ ss ] ) becomes an overdetermined system of partial differential equations .",
    "as such , it can be solved routinely , but its solution is troublesome even with the employment of software capable of automated deriving of differential consequences .",
    "the reason is that the class of second order evolution equations is invariant with respect to a large group of contact transformations @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "below we shall apply a series of suitably chosen contact transformations to achieve substantial reduction of the matrix  @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath93 is linear in @xmath112 , i.e. , @xmath113 ; 2 .   the ratio @xmath114 does not depend on @xmath112 .",
    "now , if @xmath115 , then the statement is proved .",
    "otherwise , let @xmath116 be two functionally independent solutions of the linear equation @xmath117 in particular , both @xmath118 and @xmath119 do depend on @xmath120 .",
    "then @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 satisfy the well - known necessary conditions of being a contact transformation : @xmath125 under this transformation , @xmath35 becomes @xmath126 with @xmath127 , @xmath128 , so that @xmath129 where we have used eq .  .",
    "hence @xmath130 which is independent of @xmath112 , hence of @xmath131 , by virtue of statement  ( b ) above .    [ theorem ] every second order scalar evolution equation ( [ eq ] ) possessing an irreducible @xmath3-valued zcr is transformable to an equation of the form @xmath132 through a contact transformation . here",
    "@xmath133 is an arbitrary function of @xmath4 with @xmath134 .",
    "the zcr is then @xmath35 with @xmath135    [ [ proof-3 ] ] proof + + + + +    following proposition  [ propj2 ] , we assume that the matrix @xmath34 depends on @xmath101 at most .",
    "one may check routinely that @xmath136 are among differential consequences of the system  .",
    "the general solution is @xmath137 for a suitable function @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath93 does depend on @xmath120 , then @xmath139 , whence @xmath121 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 is a point transformation .",
    "if @xmath93 does not depend on @xmath120 , then @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath13 , but does depend on @xmath142 ( otherwise @xmath43 ) , and @xmath121 , @xmath140 , @xmath143 is a point transformation . in both cases",
    "@xmath144 , whence @xmath145 in the transformed matrix @xmath146 .    with @xmath147",
    ", one can check routinely that @xmath148 is among differential consequences of system  .",
    "if moreover @xmath149 , then @xmath34 is completely independent of @xmath13 and its derivatives , and then so is @xmath55 , whence the zcr is gauge equivalent to zero .",
    "therefore , we shall continue with @xmath150 .",
    "then we can apply a point transformation @xmath151 , @xmath152 , which sends @xmath95 to @xmath153 ( this choice prevents terms quadratic in @xmath120 from appearing on the right - hand side of eq .  ) .",
    "it is then a matter of routine to compute all possible forms of the right - hand side @xmath154 of eq .   and also the corresponding matrices  @xmath55 .",
    "there seem to be no earlier appearance of the class   in the literature , let alone its ` simplest ' member @xmath155",
    ".    the results would be incomplete if we do not establish irreducibility of the zcr  .",
    "since reducibility implies existence of at least one local conservation law , we shall start with the following result .    within the class  ,",
    "the only equations to possess a conservation law are those with @xmath156 where @xmath157 are arbitrary functions of @xmath52 such that @xmath158 . in all these cases",
    "the equation has a single conservation law @xmath159    [ [ proof-4 ] ] proof + + + + +    a routine computation shows that any characteristics @xmath160 of a conservation law depends on @xmath17 at most and satisfies the equations @xmath161 the rest is easy .",
    "another computation shows that for none of the equations of the class   the corresponding zcr   can be reduced to the lower triangular form with multiples of   on the diagonal .",
    "thus , the zcr s   are indeed irreducible .    finally , a remark on equations determining pseudospherical surfaces ( pss equations ) is due . in anticipation of finding new s - integrable nonlinear systems ,",
    "a number of attempts have been made to classify equations describing pseudospherical surfaces ( pss equations ) , see  @xcite and references therein . even though being a pss equation is equivalent to possessing an @xmath3-valued zcr , the classification of second order scalar evolution pss equations as obtained by reyes  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) has no intersection with ours .",
    "this seeming paradox is easily resolved .",
    "in fact , each of the zcr s found by reyes is reducible to the lower triangular form ( the generalized burgers equation ) or even to a single conservation law ( the other equations ) , which are disregarded in our classification . on the other side , equations",
    "are not integrable , hence do not enter the classification of integrable equations by svinolupov and sokolov  @xcite , which was the starting point of the reyes work .",
