    "the present development of experimental technics in quantum complex systems make the understanding and characterization of the effect of perturbations highly desirable .",
    "the most likely suitable magnitude to characterize the effects of perturbations on quantum systems is the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "the ldos , also called strength function , was introduced by wigner @xcite to understand the statistical properties of the wave functions of complex quantum systems .",

    "wigner studied the ldos in a simple model of banded random matrices @xcite .",
    "subsequently , many authors have used the ldos to characterize the structure of the eigenstates of different random matrix models @xcite .",
    "the ldos has also been studied in several microscopic systems as for example in a ce atom @xcite , in chaotic billiards @xcite or a system of a particle that evolves in a smooth hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ldos has been studied to characterize the effect of perturbations in the operation of quantum computers in the presence of static imperfections @xcite .",
    "it was shown that depending on the characteristics of the system , the ldos has many regimes as a function of the perturbation strength @xmath8 .",
    "however , all the mentioned studies have revealed a region of perturbation strength in which the ldos has a lorentzian shape , that has been usually called breit - wigner distribution .",
    "a step forward has been recently made in the understanding of the ldos for chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "its relation with the fa has been exploited to develop a semiclassical theory of the ldos for locally perturbed billiards or maps , that is , when the perturbation is concentrated in a small region of the phase space accessible for the system .",
    "it was shown that the ldos has a lorentzian shape under very general perturbations of arbitrarily high intensity an a semiclassical expression for its width was derived .",
    "this expression only depends on the perturbation , while the properties of the system are taken into account through a uniform measure in phase space .",

    "our fundamental goal was to discuss the validity of a semiclassical theory of ldos that has been recently developed @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the relation of the ldos with the fidelity amplitude , a measure of irreversibility and sensitivity to perturbations of quantum systems .",
    "furthermore , it uses the dephasing representation of the fidelity amplitude , a semiclassical formulation that avoids the usual problems of semiclassical theories .",
    "the main assumption of the semiclassical theory of ldos is that the trajectories get uncorrelated after one step of the map .",
    "this condition is fullfiled if the dynamics is completely random or when the perturbation is applied in a infinitesimal region of the phase space .",
    "due to the fact that these conditions are not achieved in dynamical system , we tested the validity of such a semiclassical theory of the ldos .",
    "we have analyzed various situations : local and global perturbations and also we have varied the degree of chaoticity .",
    "we show that the ldos is very well described by its semiclassical expression when the map is highly chaotic , either if the perturbation is localized in phase space , or when the perturbation strength is big enough .",
    "we remark that in these cases the semiclassical ldos completely reproduces the quantum version without any fiting parameters .",
    "we have studied the case of mixed dynamics and surprisingly enough our results show that the semiclassical width of the ldos describes the full quantum version even in this case .",
    "we would like to highlite that our results could be of importance in the study of the ldos of billiards .",
    "indeed , the behavior of a billiard system has many resemblances with maps .",
    "for example , the classical dynamics of a billiard can be described by a map on the boundary .",
    "quantum billiards are realistic systems that can be constructed in experimental setups of several nature .",
    "in fact , there are cavities of microwave , acoustic or optical wave .",
    "the semiclassical approximation of the width of the ldos has been successfully applied in billiard that has been perturbed both locally @xcite and globally @xcite . however , in these works the behavior of the whole distribution was not properly discussed .",
    "further insight on the ldos of this systems will be part of future studies .",

    "we would like to thank ignacio garca mata for useful discussions ."
