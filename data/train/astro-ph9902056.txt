    "sn  1998bu in the sab galaxy m96 ( ngc  3368 ) was discovered by mirko villi ( 1998 ) on may  9.9  ut at a magnitude of about 13 , 10  days before maximum blue light , t@xmath2=may  19.7@xmath30.5  ut ( see below ) .",
    "the supernova was identified by ayani _",
    "( 1998 ) and meikle _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) as being of type  ia .",
    "a prediscovery observation on may  3.14  ut was reported by faranda & skiff ( 1998 ) .",
    "this was about 16.5  days before t@xmath2 .",
    "this makes it one of the earliest ever observations of a type  ia supernova ( a. riess , private communication ) .",
    "theoretical models indicate a rise time to t@xmath2 of 1618 days ( hflich _ et al .",
    "faranda s point constrains this to 16.618 days for sn  1998bu .",
    "we therefore estimate an explosion date of may  2.0@xmath31.0  ut . the faranda & skiff measurement was made with an unfiltered ccd , and converts to a v  magnitude of + 16.70@xmath30.10 ( a. riess , private communication ) .",
    "+ an important aspect of the discovery of this supernova is that its parent galaxy , m96 , already had an hst - cepheid - determined distance of 11.6@xmath30.8  mpc ( tanvir _ et al .",
    "more recently , using pn distances feldmeier _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) obtained an even closer distance of 9.6@xmath30.6  mpc .",
    "however , for ease of comparison with other type  ia supernovae with hst - cepheid distances , we shall adopt the value of tanvir _",
    "et al._. sn  1998bu is one of the closest type  ias of modern times , as well as being one of the earliest ever observed .",
    "good coverage was achieved by observers at the iac80 ( tenerife ) and the jkt ( la palma ) .",
    "some data were also provided by the wiyn at kitt peak .",
    "relative magnitude light curves are shown in figure  1 .",
    "they show the supernova magnitude relative to a comparison star ( gsc  0084900931 ) on the same ccd frame .",
    "+    the epochs of maximum light were estimated by comparison with the templates of leibundgut ( 1988 ) and schlegel ( 1995 ) ( figure  2 ) .",
    "maximum light in the b - band was on may  19.7@xmath30.5 days .",
    "henceforth , this epoch will be adopted as the fiducial t@xmath2=0  days .",
    "the v - band fluxes peaked at @xmath4 + 1  d , while the r and i - band fluxes peaked at 3 to 4  d i.e. _ before _ t@xmath2 .",
    "this behaviour has been noted in other type  ias such as sn  1990n and sn1992a ( suntzeff 1993 , leibundgut 1998 , lira _",
    "it follows from the fact that , even at this relatively early phase , the type  ia photosphere can not be regarded as a simple black body . the extent to which the photosphere is not a black body becomes clear when we inspect contemporary spectra ( see below ) .",
    "we also see a pronounced secondary maximum in i at about + 25  d together with an inflection in r. again , this behaviour has been seen in other type  ias ( schlegel 1995 ) . using landolt standards ( landolt 1992 )",
    ", we deduce a preliminary value for @xmath5 of + 11.89@xmath30.04 .",
    "+ sn  1998bu has yielded one of the earliest sets of _ near - ir _ photometry ever obtained .",
    "indeed , this is the first time that ir photometry for a normal type  ia event has been acquired _ before",
    "_ t@xmath2 .",
    "ir photometry obtained at the oan ( mayya _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , tcs , irtf , ukirt and wht telescopes are shown in figure  2 .",
    "interestingly , the pre - t@xmath2 ir light - curve data peak at about 5  d and thus continue the trend of pre - t@xmath2 maxima seen in the r and i - bands .",
    "also shown in figure  2 are the jhk - band template light curves of elias _ et al . _",
    "( we have slightly truncated elias _ et al . _ s original templates so that the earliest epoch of the template corresponds to elias _ et al . _ s earliest observation . )",
    "the position of these templates were fixed in the time axis by the epoch of t@xmath2 and have only been shifted vertically to provide the best match to the data .",
    "while the ir observations after @xmath4 + 10days are rather sparse , we can see that the data are consistent with the elias _ et al .",
    "_ templates .",
    "+ the absolute peak magnitudes and reddening for sn  1998bu are discussed below .",
    "examples of the optical spectra are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the 6.8  d spectrum , taken with the isis spectrograph at the wht ( meikle _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) is the earliest reported .",
    "the 0.8  d spectrum is from the ids at the int .",
    "the + 13  d spectrum was obtained at the wiyn telescope , kitt peak .",
    "it is composed of a blue spectrum taken on may  31.2  ut and a red spectrum taken on june  4.2  ut . the spectra were scaled to match in their overlap region .",
    "inspection of figure  3 immediately reveals the characteristic deep , broad si  ii absorption at 6120   , as well as other absorption lines ( at 5750 , 5440 , 5270 , 4860 , and 4270   . )",
    "typical of a normal type  ia supernova at early times .",
    "the expansion velocity derived from the shift of the si  ii absorption minimun is about 11,300  km / s .",
    "+ in figure  4 we compare sn 1998bu at maximum light with the type  ia sne  1981b and 1994d . apart from the greater degree of reddening in the sn  1998bu spectrum , the three spectra are quite similar .",
    "the spectra of sne  1998bu and 1981b are particularly alike .",
    "+ we were unable to obtain any early - time ir spectra as the ir spectrograph at ukirt ( cgs4 ) was undergoing upgrading during may and early june .",
    "an ir spectrum was obtained on june  24.2  ut ( t=+35.5  d ) , spanning 8,30025,000    ( figure  5 ) . as usual",
    ", we see the dramatic drop in the 10,000 to 12,000    region responsible for the red j  h colour at this time . the strong feature at about 8,700    is due to the calcium triplet .",
    "there is a particularly prominent feature at 10,000   .",
    "comparison with the ir spectrum of the type  ia sn  1995d ( bowers _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) at 92  d ( figure  6 ) suggests that it fades quite rapidly .",
    "p. hflich ( private communication ) has recently identified it as a very strong fe  ii line .",
    "many of the other features in the ir spectrum are probably to doubly ionised cobalt and iron ( bowers _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . +    the lack of any early - time ir spectra for sn  1998bu meant that we do not know if it exhibited the 10,500    absorption feature seen in sne  1991 t and 1994d ( meikle _ et al .",
    "however , we did obtain ir spectra for the type  ia sn  1998aq at 8.5  d and 6.5  d. in these the 10,500    feature was clearly present but was of somewhat smaller depth than in sn  1994d .",
    "as already mentioned , sn  1998bu exhibited an unusually high degree of reddening .",
    "we consider two methods for estimating the extinction _ viz . _",
    "interstellar absorption and supernova colours .",
    "measurements of interstellar nai d absorption by munari _",
    "( 1998 ) indicate an e(b - v)=0.15 ( ew=0.35   ) in the parent galaxy , with a further 0.06 ( ew=0.19   ) arising in our own galaxy .",
    "thus , we have a@xmath6=0.65 , which is unusually high for a type  ia supernova . ( the median a@xmath6 in mazzali _",
    "( 1998 ) for 14 well - observed type  ias is 0.13 )",
    ". however , suntzeff _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) argue that the munari _",
    "_ estimate is actually an _",
    "upper _ limit and so is inconsistent with extinction derived using supernova colours .",
    "+ the other approach is to use the supernova colours themselves and compare them with those expected for an unreddened type  ia supernova of the same sub - type . given the high degree of similarity in the spectral features of sne  1998bu and 1981b , we assumed that the two supernovae are intrinsically identical .",
    "we then used the empirical reddening law of cardelli _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) and gradually reddened the sn  1998bu optical spectrum to provide the best match to the sn  19981b spectrum . from this",
    "we derive a relative reddening of e(b - v)=0.26@xmath30.02 for sn  1998bu . for the total reddening to sn",
    "1981b we adopt e(b - v)=0.138@xmath30.020 ( suntzeff _ et al .",
    "+ after de - reddening , we compared our sn  1998bu observations with the light curve studies of phillips ( 1993 ) and riess _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) and with the spectroscopic sequence study of nugent _ et al . _",
    "we find that for sn  1998bu to match the trends indicated by these studies it is necessary to adopt an h@xmath0 of 5560  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "using the phillips _",
    "( 1999 ) relation relating m@xmath7 with the decline rate parameter @xmath8m@xmath9(b ) , we obtain an h@xmath0 of 61@xmath36  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 , which is consistent with suntzeff _",
    "et al . _ s ( 1999 ) v - band - derived value of 64.7@xmath37.6  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 . however , we emphasize that our result is preliminary .",
    "a more comprehensive description and analysis of this work is in preparation .",
    "we are grateful to the many observers who contributed some of their scheduled telescope time to observing sn  1998bu . in particular",
    ", we thank chris benn , tom geballe , di harmer , pete hammersley , simon kemp , don pollacco , nic walton and bill vacca for their assistance in acquiring these observations .",
    "we also thank david branch , peter hflich , paolo mazzali , phil pinto , adam riess , nick suntzeff and craig wheeler for helpful discussions ."
