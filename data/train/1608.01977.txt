    "we note that in our case the efficiency of the cycle depends strongly on the amplitude of the applied electric field . the quantum otto cycle for different number of spins is shown in fig .",
    "[ cycle_therm_eq ] .",
    "as we see with increasing the length of the spin chain the total polarization of the system becomes larger .",
    "the amplitude of variation of the polarization during the cycle enhances and the system produces more work .",
    "however , the efficiency of the cycle is the same ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : effi ] ) .",
    "our aim has been to construct a finite time quantum thermodynamic cycle with a reasonable output power .",
    "hence , we tried to minimize the execution time of the adiabatic strokes of the cycle . for this purpose",
    "we implement shortcuts to adiabaticity and realized transitionless fast quantum adiabatic dynamics .",
    "a merit of the present quantum heat engine is that the working substance experimentally feasible ( e.g. , single phase multiferroic @xmath0 spin chain ) and tunable by external electromagnetic fields . indeed , due to the non - collinear chiral spin order the cycle can be controlled by an applied external electric field .",
    "for clarity we studied an exactly solvable model and obtained analytical expressions for the counter - diabatic hamiltonian . using the analytical results the mean square fluctuation for the work , the irreversible work and output power of the cycle are evaluated .",
    "we observed that the work mean square fluctuations is increasing with the duration of the adiabatic strokes @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ rms ] ) .",
    "however , the irreversible work shows non - monotonic behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ irwork ] ) and has a maximum for @xmath208(ps ) . at the end of adiabatic stroke",
    "the irreversible work becomes zero confirming thus that the cycle is reversible .",
    "the output power of the cycle also shows a non - monotonic behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ power ] ) with a maximum at @xmath209(ps ) .",
    "this theoretical finding illustrates the existence of an inherent maximal output power . further decreasing the execution time of the cycle we can not go beyond this inherent maximal output power . by implementing a lindblad master equation we studied the thermal relaxation of the system .",
    "we evaluated the transferred to the working substance heat @xmath196 and heat released by system to the cold bath @xmath197 .",
    "we find a cylce efficiency of @xmath210 .",
