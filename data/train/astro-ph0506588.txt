    "the investigation of the energy spectra and elemental composition of primary cosmic rays in the knee region ( @xmath0 tev ) remains to be one of the intriguing problems of the modern high energy cosmic - ray physics .",
    "despite the fact that these investigations have been carried out for more than half a century , the data on the elemental primary energy spectra at energies of @xmath7 tev need improvement . however , a bend of the all - particle energy spectra at around @xmath8 tev ( called the `` knee '' ) at overall spectrum @xmath9 until the knee and @xmath10 beyond the knee , may be considered as an avowed fact .",
    "moreover , assuming that the supernova explosion is the main source of the cosmic rays , different theoretical models of the high energy cosmic - ray origin and propagation through the galaxy , predict the rigidity - dependent steepening primary energy spectra in the knee region @xcite .",
    "+ high statistical accuracies of the last eas experiments @xcite already allowed us to infer that the rigidity - dependent steepening energy spectra of primary nuclei can approximately describe the observed eas size spectra in the knee region in the framework of conventional interaction models . however , the accuracies of the obtained elemental primary energy spectra are still insufficient due to both the uncertainty of interaction model and the accuracy of the solutions of the eas inverse problem . + the gamma facility ( fig .",

    "<S> on the basis of the extensive air shower ( eas ) data observed by the gamma experiment the energy spectra and elemental composition of the primary cosmic rays have been derived in the @xmath0 tev energy range . </S>",
    "<S> reconstruction of the primary energy spectra is carried out in the framework of the sibyll and qgsjet interaction models and the hypothesis of the power - law steepening primary energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained energy spectra of primary @xmath1 nuclei along with the sibyll interaction model agree with the corresponding extrapolations of known balloon and satellite data at the @xmath2 tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectra obtained from the qgsjet model , show predominant proton composition of cosmic rays in the knee region . </S>",
    "<S> the evident rigidity - dependent behavior of the primary energy spectra for both interaction models are displayed at the following rigidities : @xmath3 tv ( sibyll ) and @xmath4 tv ( qgsjet ) . </S>",
    "<S> + using parametric event - by - event method of the primary energy evaluation by measured @xmath5 and age ( @xmath6 ) shower parameters , the all - particle energy spectra were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> + all presented results are derived taking into account the detector response , reconstruction uncertainties of eas parameters and fluctuation of eas development . </S>"
