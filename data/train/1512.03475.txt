    "since the general relativity can good explain on many specifications of universe by observational evidence and various theories .",
    "then , we should concentrate our attention to other unknown issues .",
    "one of the unknown issues is non - singularity in the standard big bang cosmology . to solve this issue we need to introduce a scientific model for the known universe , so that it describes the universe as oscillatory",
    "this means that our universe is as a result of the collapse of a previous universe @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a new idea was proposed named bouncing universe that is able to solve non - singularity of the big bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "also , the bouncing universe was studied in brane cosmology @xcite and in vector field @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the bouncing universe is that when the bounce occurs the universe is entered to big bang era , and the universe transfers from an initial contracting phase to an expanding phase so that at this point the hubble parameter transits from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and we have in bounce point @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "nowadays , many articles have been written due to observational evidence and various theories about expansion of the universe which the expanding is undergoing an accelerating phase . the discovery of this topic was first arisen in type ia supernova @xcite , associated with large scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "we note that the accelerated expansion is due to a mysterious energy so - called dark energy which is more than @xmath4 of the total energy in our universe .",
    "the universe dominates with a perfect fluid by a negative pressure and an equation of state ( eos ) parameter which is less than @xmath5 so - called phantom phase .",
    "there are many candidates to describe dark energy scenario so that we can introduce some of them such as the cosmological constant @xcite , the scalar fields ( including quintessence , phantom , quintom , tachyon and etc ) @xcite , holographic models @xcite , modified models @xcite , interacting models @xcite and braneworld models @xcite .    among these models ,",
    "modified gravity theory has advantages in comparison with other models , because it prevents the complicated computation of numerical solutions , and also it is consistent with recent observations for late accelerating universe and dark energy .",
    "one of the modified gravity models is accomplished by changing the ricci scalar @xmath6 to @xmath0 with an arbitrary function in the gravitational action which this model is named @xmath0 gravity theory @xcite . the @xmath0 gravity is a good alternative instead of the standard gravity model as a source of dark energy . as it just mentioned , the einstein ",
    "hilbert action is written in terms of two terms @xmath0 and matter lagrangian , and will obtain friedmann equations in friedmann  lematre ",
    "walker ( flrw ) metric .    in this paper",
    ", we will avoid the initial singularity in the big bang theory by @xmath0 theory and bouncing model .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the bouncing cosmology with @xmath0 gravity by hu ",
    "sawicki model @xcite , and we will show that there is an accelerated phase shift from an initial contracting phase to an expanding phase . the issue is demonstrates by scale factor @xmath7 , which the scale factor derivative ( @xmath8 ) decrease during the contracting phase and it ( @xmath9 ) increase in the expanding phase and also it ( @xmath10 ) is equal zero in the bounce point .",
    "the corresponding figures will confirm the aforesaid story .",
    "in what follows , we try to describe the @xmath0 gravity as a source of dark energy to reconstruct by redshift parameter .",
    "therefore , we will investigate a parametrization for @xmath0 gravity with this motivation that we can describe the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "finally , we will investigate the stability of the model so that university is considered as a thermodynamic system in an adiabatic perturbation .",
    "therefore , by using of an useful function named sound speed will study the stability of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we review @xmath0 gravity model and obtain the friedmann equations by using the corresponding action in flrw metric . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , we investigate the bouncing behavior by hubble parameter and the scale factor , and we obtain bouncing condition by hu  sawicki model . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , we reconstruct the current model with redshift parameter and then we will use a parametrization for precise description of the dark energy .",
    "thereinafter , effective energy density and effective pressure of universe will be written in terms of redshift , and will plot the cosmological parameters . in sec .",
    "[ v ] , we study stability of the model and investigate it in late time . finally , in sec . [ vi ] , we present a short summary for this job .",
    "let us start by considering coupling influence @xmath0 gravity with matter in @xmath11-dimensional action as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of ricci scalar r , and @xmath14 is a matter lagrangian . by taking the variation of the action with respect to metric @xmath15 , one obtains @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a spatially flat flrw background as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath7 is the scale factor .",
    "the ricci scalar r is found as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hubble parameter and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "+ the two friedmann equations obtain from as    [ e5 ] @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are energy density and pressure of an universe dominated by matter , respectively . by using the continuity equation @xmath24 , and for a perfect fluid with the eos parameter",
    "@xmath25 finds @xmath26 where solution of the differential equation becomes @xmath27    now by comparing the current model with the standard friedmann equations ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , we can rewrite eqs . in terms of the effective energy density and effective pressure as    [ e8 ] @xmath30    where",
    "[ e9 ] @xmath31    the conservation equation can be obtained by using eqs . as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective eos parameter .",
    "we explorer bouncing behavior in next section .",
    "in this section , we will describe the bouncing conditions in @xmath0 gravity model . when a bouncing universe occurs that universe transfers of fluctuations from an initial contracting phase to an expanding phase .",
    "this phase shift give rise to a solution of non - singular in the standard big bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a successful bounce , the hubble parameter passes from @xmath1 to @xmath34 and in bounce point @xmath3 .",
    "also we can express issue of bouncing universe in terms of the scale factor , i.e. , during the contracting phase we have a decrease for the scale factor as @xmath35 , and in the expanding phase we have a increase as @xmath36 , and in the bounce point @xmath37 and around this point @xmath38 .",
    "since the hubble parameter passes from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in terms of time evolution for the bouncing universe , then the derivative of hubble parameter must be bigger than zero in bounce point as @xmath41 from this condition we deduce @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "now we can obtain the bounce condition for the model in bounce point . in that case",
    ", we must have @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so that the bouncing condition in the bounce point by eqs .",
    "be deduced as @xmath46 in the following , we will study our model by a particular @xmath47 model that one was first proposed by hu and sawicki @xcite .",
    "the hu - sawicki model can create the late time accelerated universe , and also corresponded with a good approximation by the @xmath48 model in the large redshift .",
    "we can write the corresponding model by @xcite @xmath49    , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . ]    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are free parameters , and use the natural units as @xmath62 . by inserting into eqs . , and numerical solution of the obtained friedmann equations we can draw the cosmological parameters in terms of cosmic time in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "the motivation of this choice is based on crossing of eos over phantom - divide - line , and finding bouncing condition .",
    "we note that the bouncing behavior can be observed in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , i.e. , on the one hand , we can see that the hubble parameter passes from the bounce point ( @xmath63 ) as @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and on the other hand , we see that the scale factor is minimum or @xmath64 .    the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which these show a accelerated universe .",
    "also we can observe variation of the eos with respect to cosmic time in [ fig3 ] , and one show crossing over phantom - divide - line that the issue corresponds to observational data of late time @xcite .",
    "+ in next section we will reconstruct the aforesaid model using the concept of redshift .",
    "in this section , we are going to investigate the model by redshift parameter .",
    "one can be introduced in terms of the scale factor as @xmath67 in which @xmath68 is the value of the scale factor at the present universe , or other words redshift is zero in the late cosmic time .",
    "therefore , dimensionless parameter @xmath69 is introduced so that @xmath70 is the hubble parameter of current universe . in order to rewrite the aforesaid friedmann equations in terms of redshift , the differential form with respect to cosmic time",
    "becomes @xmath71 then , eqs . and are written in terms of @xmath72 in the following form @xmath73 @xmath74 , \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 , \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "the matter energy density and functions @xmath0 and its derivative with respect to @xmath6 are written by @xmath76    now , in order to reconstruct the model as a origin of dark energy , we must introduce function @xmath77 so that one is fitted with observational data of supernova @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , one of the fitting functions is frequently considered as third - degree polynomial parametrization in terms of redshift , i.e. , @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "it should be noted that the aforesaid parametrization matches with @xmath80cdm model when @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the best fit parameters are as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite . in this literature , we choose free parameter values of the parametrization as @xmath83 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we note that free parameters play a very important role in this job , so selected incentive is based on that effective energy density and effective pressure become positive and negative respectively , and also eos crosses over the phantom divide line .    in what follows , by substituting into eqs . and , we can obtain cosmological parameters in terms of redshift .",
    "therefore , we plot @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in terms of redshift accordance with fig .",
    "the variation of effective eos shows us that the value of eos is equal to about @xmath92 in late time ( @xmath93 ) , and this confirms condition @xmath42 as an accelerated expansion of the universe .",

    "in this section , we will discuss on stability of the @xmath0 gravity .",
    "since universe has been filled the perfect fluid , then we can consider it as a thermodynamic system .",
    "for this purpose , we will use the quantity of sound speed for the perfect fluid system . as we know",
    "the sound speed is introduced by an useful function as @xmath97 , in which @xmath90 and @xmath89 are the effective energy density and effective pressure of universe . since the sound speed @xmath98 is positive in a thermodynamic system",
    ", hence the stability condition occurs when the function @xmath98 becomes bigger than zero .",
    "we note that a thermodynamic system can be described with adiabatic and non - adiabatic perturbations by quantities the effective energy density , effective pressure and entropy .",
    "now we consider the corresponding system as @xmath99 , and making perturbation with respect to the effective pressure we have @xmath100 where the first term is related to a non - adiabatic process and second term is related to adiabatic process in the cosmological problem . since we consider an adiabatic perturbation in cosmology , then variety of entropy becomes zero for the cosmological system , i.e. , @xmath101 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied @xmath0 gravity by an arbitrary function of curvature called hu  sawicki model in flrw metric .",
