    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are similar states consisting of an @xmath2-quark and a @xmath3-antiquark except for the spins as @xmath0 is in the spin - singlet state while @xmath1 is in the triplet",
    ". therefore we can easily attribute any differences to the spin - dependent nature of the interaction in the two states .",
    "however their mass difference is quite large in comparison with the mass differences between other meson pairs such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) or @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . in this ground the large mass difference",
    "might also be due to the small mass of @xmath0 , which is explained as a result of the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "therefore it will be helpful to identify the origin of the small mass of @xmath0 and to trace the big mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are quark - antiquark systems which can be described within non - relativistic framework .",
    "however quarks are light particles and interact strongly ; they should be treated relativistically . furthermore , spin - dependence is purely relativistic in nature and can not be derived non - relativistically .",
    "therefore we need a relativistic description rather than a non - relativistic description , for the quark - antiquark systems .",
    "todorov has suggested the two - body relativistic equations for spinless two - body systems @xcite .",
    "based on the dirac s constraint formalism and a minimal interaction structure the tbde has been tested and confirmed in classical @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite . within this formalism , two coupled 16-component dirac equation with 2 fermion basis",
    "is reduced to the single 4-component 2nd - order differential equation and the radial part of this equation are simply schrdinger - type with various terms calculated from a basic radial potential , which can be phenomenologically adopted .",
    "we have constructed the two - body dirac equations ( tbde ) @xcite for two interacting fermions in a form that is as easy to handle as the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "the brief description of this formalism is summarized in sec .",
    "2 . for the interactions between a quark and an antiquark we adopt some phenomenological potential , which will be described in sec . 3 . final numerical results and discussions will be presented in sec .",
    "van alstine and crater utilized the two body dirac constraint dynamics for two interacting fermions with mass - shell constraint to reduce the relative energy and time degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "they applied the pauli reduction and scale transformation and succeeded in reducing the 16 component dirac equation into a 4 component relativistic schrdinger - type equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the invariant mass and @xmath12 with the relativistic energy @xmath13 and the relativistic reduced mass @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 plays a role of interaction in the schrdinger - type equation ( [ schreq ] ) and includes many relativistic terms : darwin(@xmath16 ) , spin - spin(@xmath17 ) , tensor(@xmath18 ) , spin - orbit(@xmath19 ) , etc . for a scalar potential @xmath20 and a time - like vector potential @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath15 can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath22    if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are central radial potentials , this equation is reduced further into two - coupled radial equations . for @xmath0 which is in a spin - singlet state ,",
    "the differential equation becomes @xmath23 @xmath1 is in a spin - triplet state , which is a superposition of the s- and d - states .",
    "these two states are coupled by the following differential equations @xmath24 @xmath25 here @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are corresponding quantities of @xmath1 for the s - state and d - state , respectively . solving these equations are not easy but at least manageable numerically .",
    "to complete the differential equation , we need a basic potentials between a quark and an antiquark .",
    "commonly used potential for two quarks are the static cornell potential , which is composed of a static coulomb - type potential and a linear potential @xcite .",
    "however this potential does not reflect the asymptotic freedom which is one of the important characteristics of the @xmath29 interaction .",
    "richardson@xcite has suggested the following form for heavy quarkonia , @xmath30 in momentum space .",
    "after fourier transform to coordinate system , it becomes @xmath31 the function @xmath32 needs to approach @xmath33 as @xmath34 and to approach 1 as @xmath35 for the potential satisfying both crucial characteristics in qcd , the asymptotic freedom and the confinement .",
    "we modified this potential using 3 parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 these 3 parameters will be determined to fit the experimental values of meson masses .",
    "the one feature of this method is that there is no cutoff parameter introduced .",
    "everything is treated non - perturbatively and it gives good results for heavy quark meson systems as well as light two quark systems .    partitioning the confinement term in @xmath40 of eq.([modrpot ] ) as an invariant @xmath20 responsible for the scalar potential and the coulomb - like term as an invariant @xmath21 responsible for the full four - vector potential , we can obtain the specific forms for the various terms in eq.([interaction ] ) .",
    "the readers can refer the eqs.(a17)-(a20 ) in the ref.@xcite for their explicit forms .",
    "and @xmath1 . the solid ( black in color ) line is @xmath0 wave function .",
    "the dashed ( red in color ) curve is the s - state wave function of @xmath1 and the dotted ( blue in color ) curve is the d - state wave function of @xmath1.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we fit the invariant masses of 32 mesons and determine 3 parameters in the potential .",
    "their values are @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . here",
    "the quark masses used to give the best fit are @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 gev . then using these values we solve the differential equations , eq.([pieq ] ) for @xmath0 and eqs.([rhoeq1 ] ) and ( [ rhoeq2 ] ) for @xmath1 , and",
    "obtain their wave functions .",
    "they are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the wave functions for both mesons are not singular at short distances and the asymptotic behavior of d - state wave function of @xmath1 is proportional to that of its s - state wave function at small radii .    with the given wave functions we can obtain the eigenvalues , @xmath46 , which in turn give the invariant masses of 0.159 gev for @xmath0 and 0.792 gev for @xmath1 , while their experimental values are 0.140 gev and 0.775 gev , respectively .",
    "we tabulated the contribution of each term in eqs.([pieq])-([rhoeq2 ] ) in table [ tab:0 ] .",
    "the spin - spin contribution ( @xmath47 ) for pion is larger than the other spin - dependent terms by an order of magnitude .",
    "however for @xmath1 the same contribution ( @xmath48 ) is smaller than the other spin - dependent contributions by an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore the spin - dependent term plays crucial role for the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the major contribution for pion mass comes from the darwin ( @xmath49 ) and spin - spin interaction terms .",
    "the magnitudes of these two terms are about same but opposite in sign , and therefore they almost cancel each other , resulting in a small pion mass .",
    "however for the @xmath1 , the darwin term is not dominant at all .",
    "it is about the same as or less than the off - diagonal contributions from tensor ( @xmath50 ) or spin - orbit - tensor ( @xmath51 ) terms .",
    "besides that the spin - spin contribution is much smaller than the darwin or the off - diagonal terms , it contributes in same direction as the darwin term , as distinct from the pion case .",
    "overall the @xmath1 mass is not that small .",
    "we can also notice that the kinetic energy contributions ( @xmath52 ) are almost 1 gev for @xmath0 and 0.5 gev for @xmath1 .",
    "these numbers are much larger than the quark masses of @xmath53 gev and it justifies to treat the quarks relativistically .",
    "finally we can conclude that the cancellation between the darwin and spin - spin interaction terms occurs in @xmath0 mass but not in @xmath1 mass and this is the main source of a big difference in two masses .",
    "also we can say that our theory is consistent with the chiral symmetry breaking which causes the non - zero small mass of pion .",
    ".the contributions of all terms in eqs.([pieq])-([rhoeq2 ] ) .",
    "the column @xmath54 is for @xmath0 with s - state only and the remaining four columns are the diagonal and off - diagonal terms for @xmath1 with both s- and d - state wave functions .",
