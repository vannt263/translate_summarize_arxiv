    "proteins are the central players in the game of life .",
    "they are involved in almost all processes in cells and organisms , comprising replication , metabolism , and movement . to be able to perform their specific functions , proteins have to adopt a certain fold or structure , which is encoded by the protein s sequence .",
    "thus , knowledge of a protein s structure elucidates the mechanisms it is involved .    currently , it is not possible to calculate a protein s functional fold from its sequence nor to simulate the whole folding process in detail .",
    "simplified protein models are used to reduce the computational complexity . a common abstraction are lattice proteins  @xcite . here",
    ", the structure space a protein can adopt is discretized and allows for efficient folding simulations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is difficult to determine minimal energy structures , which represent the functional folds in such models . even in the most simple hydrophobic - polar ( hp )  model  @xcite",
    ", the optimal structure prediction problem stays computationally hard ( np - complete )  @xcite . despite this complexity , a fast calculation of non - symmetrical optimal structures in the hp  model is possible using constraint programming techniques applied in the _ constraint - based protein structure prediction ( cpsp ) _",
    "approach  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced a significantly improved local search scheme for lattice protein folding simulations  @xcite using a full miyazawa - jernigan energy potential  @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the efficient cpsp approach and initialize the folding simulations with optimal structures from the simpler hp  model .",
    "this incorporates the phenomenon of hydrophobic collapse of protein structures , a driving force at the beginning of the folding process  @xcite .",
    "the already compact structures from the cpsp application form the starting point of the folding driven by more complex interactions .",
    "this scheme outperforms folding simulations using a standard initialization with random structures and yields better results within shorter simulation time  @xcite .",
    "to increase efficiency of local search methods , usually many optimization runs from different starting points are done .",
    "since the set of all hp - optimal structures is usually too large as a starting set , we are interested in a smaller subset that still covers the structural diversity of the whole set as good as possible .",
    "we achieve this by enumerating optimal structures that maintain a given minimal distance to each other .    due to the hydrophobicity - focusing energy function ,",
    "proteins in hp  models show on average a huge number of optimal structures .",
    "since polar residues do not contribute to the energy , optimal structures usually show a much higher variation in the placement of polar than hydrophobic residues .    here",
    ", we introduce an equivalence relation to partition the set of ( optimal ) structures into according classes .",
    "two structures are defined to be equivalent , iff they do not differ in the placements of their hydrophobic residues .",
    "we introduce an extension to the cpsp approach that enables an efficient calculation of the number of equivalence classes of optimal structures via enumerating one representative per class .",
    "the approach is presented for backbone - only and side chain incorporating hp  models .",
    "we show that a sequence s number of representatives ( later defined as core - degeneracy ) is several magnitudes smaller than the overall number of all optimal structures ( degeneracy ) .",
    "thus , the set of optimal representatives is well placed to be used within the combined approach of cpsp and local search  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we propose another application of the equivalence classes : since the equivalence relation is highly correlated to the hp  energy function , the number of classes might be a better measure of structural stability than a sequences degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "a lattice protein in the hp  model is specified by its sequence  @xmath0 , where  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 denote hydrophobic and polar monomers , respectively .",
    "the structure positions are confined to nodes of a regular lattice  @xmath3 .",
    "a valid _ backbone - only _ structure  @xmath4 of length  @xmath5 is a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) in the underlying lattice  @xmath6 , i.e. it holds connectivity @xmath7 and self - avoidance @xmath8 , where  @xmath9 denotes the set of distance vectors between neighbored points in  @xmath6 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fcc - struct]a ) .",
    "the energy of a lattice protein structure is given by non - consecutive hh - contacts : @xmath10    a )        b )        an _ optimal structure _ minimizes the energy function .",
    "the number of optimal structures is denoted as _ degeneracy _ of a sequence and is an important measure of structural stability  @xcite .",
    "the _ cpsp - approach _ by backofen and will  @xcite enables the calculation of a sequence s degeneracy without full structure space enumeration  @xcite .",
    "it utilizes the observation that optimal structures show a ( nearly ) optimal packing of h  monomers .",
    "thus , the cpsp - approach can be sketched in two major steps :    1 .",
    "_ h - core construction : _ given the number  @xmath11 of h  monomers from the target sequence  @xmath12 , all optimal packings of @xmath11  monomers are calculated .",
    "these _ optimal h - cores _ show the maximal number of contacts possible . for a fixed sequence  @xmath12 and the corresponding  @xmath11",
    ", we denote the set of optimal h - cores with @xmath13 .",
    "the calculation of  @xmath13 is computationally difficult on its own and was solved by us using constraint programming  @xcite .",
    "structure threading : _ given  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 only structures are enumerated where the h  monomers of  @xmath12 are confined to an optimal h - core  @xmath14 , i.e. they are `` threaded '' through the h - cores . since all  @xmath15 show the maximally possible number of contacts between h  monomers , each resulting structure is optimal according to eq .",
    "[ eq : e_hp ] as well .",
    "the structure threading is done by solving a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) for each  @xmath14 as given below .",
    "since step  1 depends only on the number of h  monomers  @xmath11 and no further property of any sequence , we can precalculate the h - cores for different  @xmath11 and store them in a database .",
    "this significantly speeds up the approach and reduces the computation time to step  2 , i.e. the structure threading .",
    "it might happen , that we find no appropriate structure threading for a sequence  @xmath12 and the according set of optimal h - cores  @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we revert to the set of the best suboptimal h - cores  @xmath16 that show at least one contact less than an optimal h - core  @xmath14 and iterate the procedure .",
    "still it holds : the first successive structure threading is an optimal structure , since no h  monomer packing with more contacts was found before .",
    "further details on the cpsp approach in  @xcite .",
    "the csps solved in step  2 are given by @xmath17 , where we denote the set of variables  @xmath18 , their domains  @xmath19 , and a set of constraints  @xmath20 . for each monomer",
    "@xmath21 a variable  @xmath22 is introduced .",
    "the saw is modeled by a sequence of binary neighboring constraints @xmath23 and a global @xmath24 to enforce the self - avoidingness .",
    "the optimal h - core  @xmath14 is used to define the domains  @xmath19 : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , if we find a solution of such a csp , i.e. an assignment @xmath27 for each variable that satisfies all constraints in  @xmath20 , it will minimize the energy function in eq .",
    "[ eq : e_hp ] , i.e. an optimal structure .",
    "revisiting the csp we can see , that p  monomers are constrained only by the saw constraints . imagine a sequence with a long tail of p  monomers .",
    "each valid placement of the subchain in front of the tail can be combined with a combinatorial number of possible saws of the tail .",
    "this leads to the immense degeneracy in the hp  model .",
    "therefore , we set up an _ equivalence relation  @xmath28 _ on structures ( eq .  [ eq - equiv ] ) that decomposes the set of all ( optimal ) structures into equivalence classes . in the following",
    ", the number of equivalence classes of optimal structures is denoted as _ core - degeneracy_. as given by eq .",
    "[ eq - equiv ] , structures from different equivalence classes differ in at least one h  monomer placement .",
    "@xmath29    the representative enumeration ( that corresponds to core - degeneracy calculation ) can be done via an extension of the cpsp approach presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - prelim ] . instead of calculating all optimal structures ,",
    "we want to calculate only one representative per equivalence class .",
    "this has to be ensured at two stages : ( i ) the solutions of each single csp for a given h - core have to be different according to  eq .",
    "[ eq - equiv ] , and ( ii ) the solutions from two csps for two different h - cores have to be different as well . the second condition ( ii )",
    "holds by definition , because  @xmath28 is only defined on the h  monomer placements that are constrained by different h - cores from  @xmath13 ( differing in at least one position ) . in the following",
    ", we will discuss how to achieve the difference for solutions of a single csp ( i ) .",
    "note that the core - degeneracy , i.e. the number of different placements of h - monomers , or core - configurations , in optimal structures of a sequence , is _ not equal _ to the number of different h - cores , which are the sets of lattice points that are occupied by h - monomers .",
    "the latter number is easily obtained from the standard prediction algorithm , described in sec .",
    "[ sec - prelim ] .",
    "it equals the number of cores , where the sequence is successfully threaded on .",
    "the standard way to solve a csp is a combination of domain filtering ( i.e. constraint propagation ) and depth first search .",
    "this results in a binary tree where each node represents a subproblem of the initial csp ( root ) and edges represent the additional constraints added to derive the two subproblems from its predecessor node ( csp ) .",
    "the constraints  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 added to derive the leave nodes of a certain csp are often of the form @xmath32 by selecting a variable @xmath33 from @xmath18 and a value @xmath34 according to some heuristics .",
    "the constraint solver traverse the binary tree until a solution was found or an inconsistency of a constraint from  @xmath20 was detected .",
    "therefore , a straightforward way to enumerate only one representative for each equivalence class can be sketched as follows : first , we restrict the search of the solving process onto the h  associated variables .",
    "then , we perform a single check for satisfiability , i.e. search for a single assignment of p  monomer variables fulfilling all constraints in  @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we get only one p  monomer placement for a given h  monomer assignment if any exists .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that we restrict the variable order of the search heuristics .",
    "but the performance of the cpsp  approach mainly depends on the search heuristics applied to select a certain variable or value from its domain .",
    "it turned out that a mixed assignment of h  and p  associated variables yields the best runtimes .",
    "these heuristics can not be applied within the sketched procedure where we have to first assign h - associated variables , then p - associated ones .",
    "thus , a lower cpsp performance is expected .",
    "but , we have to do less search which results in much faster runtimes than enumerating all optimal structures .",
    "recently , we have introduced the extension of the cpsp approach  @xcite to _ hp  models including side chains _  @xcite . here",
    ", each amino acid of a protein sequence is represented by two monomers : @xmath35 representing the backbone atoms , and @xmath36 representing the atoms of the side chain . beneath the saw condition on the backbone monomers  @xmath35 ,",
    "we constrain each side chain to be neighbored to its backbone , i.e. @xmath37 . an example structure",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fcc - struct]b ) . the applied energy function  @xmath38 exploits only hh - contacts of side chain monomers  @xmath36 : @xmath39    therefore , the side chain models show an even higher degeneracy than the backbone - only models discussed so far , since all backbone monomers  @xmath35 are unconstrained by the energy function as well .",
    "thus , an equivalence relation  @xmath40 that focuses on the monomers constrained by the energy function is even more striking in hp  models including side chains .",
    "the relation  @xmath40 is given by @xmath41    therefore , we will enforce that structures from one equivalence class show the same h  monomer side chain positioning .",
    "the cpsp approach for hp  models including side chains differs only in the csp formulation from the original approach for backbone - only models  @xcite .",
    "this allows for the application of the same approach discussed in the previous section to enumerate non - equivalent optimal structure representatives .",
    "thus , we restrict search to the h  associated side chain variables first and only check for satisfiability on the remaining variables .",
    "we exemplify the enumeration of representatives for backbone - only and side chain models .",
    "we focus on the comparison of the resulting core - degeneracy of a sequence and its overall number of optimal structures , i.e. degeneracy , because we are interested in a reduced set of optimal structures , e.g. for local search initialization ( see introduction ) .",
    "all following results are given for hp - sequences of length  27 in 3d  cubic lattice .",
    "since the enumeration and check of all @xmath42  sequences ( @xmath43 ) is computationally not feasible , we restrict each study to a large randomly chosen subset of  @xmath44 and @xmath45  sequences , respectively .",
    "the program hprep implements the approach from section  [ sec - approach ] .",
    "it is integrated into the cpsp - tools package  @xcite version 2.4.0 and available online .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - prelim ] , the structure threading step of the cpsp approach screens through a precomputed list of appropriate h - cores in decreasing number of contacts stored in a database .",
    "therefore , it might occur that the available list from the database is exceeded without any solution , i.e. no optimal structure was computed .",
    "still , the energy of the last h - core tried is a close lower bound on the energy this sequence can adopt . in the following , @xmath46  denotes the subset of sequences where the current h - core database is not sufficient and thus the cpsp approach can give only a lower bound for now .",
    "the number of sequences in  @xmath46 is quite small .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the degeneracy distribution among  @xmath46 is the same as for the remaining sequences or on average even higher .    * backbone - only models * +    .",

    "@xmath46 comprises about  4% of the sequences .",
    "the remaining 30%  can adopt even more than @xmath47  structures with minimal energy .",
    "figure  [ deg - shift - bb ] summarizes the results : in _ red _ the degeneracy and in _ green _ the core - degeneracy distribution with cut - off  @xmath47 is presented .",
    "thus , in _ red _ the degeneracy distribution comprises 66%  of the sequences as given above . in contrast , _ all _ sequences show a number of optimal equivalence classes below  @xmath47 ( in _ green _ ) ! the average degeneracy is reduced from  @xmath48 ( with cutoff  @xmath47 ) to a mean core - degeneracy of  @xmath49 .",
    "this reduction within two orders of magnitude results in reasonably small sets of representative structures e.g. to be utilized in local search initializations .",
    "furthermore , the enumeration of representatives is on average six times faster than the enumeration of all optimal structures with a mean runtime of 2  seconds ( opteron  2356 - 2.3  ghz ) .",
    "this increase of small sets of representatives compared to the complete sets of optimal structures shows the advantage of the approach : core - degeneracy does not show the huge combinatorial explosion of degeneracy .",
    "this gets even more striking in hp  models including side chains , as shown in the next section .    * models including side chains * +    .",
    "note : only  408 sequences out of  @xmath45 showed a degeneracy below  @xmath47 as given in the text .",

    "this results from the simple energy function ( eq .  [ eq : e_hp_sc ] ) that does not constrain the backbone or p  monomers . therefore , an immense number of optimal structures is present . from the @xmath45  hp - sequences tested only  408 show a degeneracy below  @xmath47 .",

    "the average number of representatives is about  1550 , which is again at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the average degeneracy .",
