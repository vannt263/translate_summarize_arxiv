    "the purpose of this paper is to develop the semi - quantitative extension of the bcs theory of superconductivity that describes strongly disordered conductors which normal state is a weak anderson insulator  @xcite or a very poor metal .",
    "the paper focuses on the case of `` uniformly disordered '' materials , which do not contain morphological structures such as grains coupled by tunnel junctions .",
    "below in this section we briefly review the existing theoretical models of the superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) , compare them with the results of the experimental studies of the uniformly disordered films and choose the appropriate model for the superconductor - insulator transition in these materials .",
    "the conclusion of this introductory part is that this quantum transition in uniformly disordered films can be described by bcs pairing of electrons which single - particle states are close to the mobility edge of anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "because bcs pairing is most relevant for electrons close to the fermi surface , the transition occurs when fermi - level @xmath7 is located in the region of localized single - electron states but close to the mobility edge . in the vicinity of the transition localization length",
    "is longer than typical distance between carriers while the relevant single electron states have the statistical properties of `` critical wavefunctions '' .",
    "section [ model ] formulates the model in more detail and discusses the issue of _ wavefunction fractality _ , which turns out to be very important for the theory of superconductor - insulator transition developed in this work .    the important difference between our approach and many other works on superconductor  insulator transition is neglect of the effects of coulomb interaction but consistent treatment of moderately strong disorder .",
    "in this respect our work is the extension of the approaches developed originally by ma and lee  @xcite , kapitulnik and kotliar  @xcite , bulaevskii and sadovskii  @xcite , and more recently by ghosal , trivedi and randeria  @xcite that have considered competition of superconducting pairing and anderson localization without explicit account for coulomb interaction .",
    "we give detailed arguments which justify applicability of our approach to disordered films such as amorphous ino@xmath8 and tin on both phenomenological and microscopic levels below in subsection experimental results .",
    "briefly , one should distinguish two possible effects of the coulomb interaction : suppression of paring interaction between individual fermions which occurs at short scales and enhancement of the phase fluctuations of the order parameter at large scales .",
    "the first would lead to a gap suppression in a direct contradiction with data while the second would lead to the phenomenology similar to that of josephson junction arrays which display markedly different behavior .",
    "our theory can be also applied to the cold atoms in optical and magnetic lattices with a controlled disorder . in such systems interaction",
    "is always attractive and effectively short - range .",
    "moreover , it is tunable by magnetic field due to the feshbach resonance  @xcite which would allow to test directly the detailed predictions of the developed theory .",
    "the important consequence of the wave function fractality is the formation of the strongly bound electron pairs which survive deep in the insulating regime .",
    "in this situation the pairing interaction reduces the mobility of individual electons leading to `` superconductivity - induced '' insulator .",
    "we discuss this behavior in section [ insulating state ] .",
    "theory of cooper pairing of electrons populating critical fractal states is developed in section [ cooper instability ] .",
    "here we develop three different approximations for the computation of the superconducting transition temperature and other properties .",
    "section [ superconducting state ] gives the physical properties of the superconductor in this regime .",
    "we show that three different approximations developed in section [ cooper instability ] agree with each other and predict parametrically strong enhancement of @xmath9 with respect to its value given by the `` anderson theorem '' .",
    "another distinguishing feature of the emerging superconducting state is extremely strong spatial inhomogeneity of superconducting order parameter and the presence of a well - defined global @xmath10 .",
    "section [ superconductivity with a pseudogap ] presents the theory of superconductivity coexisting with a strong pseudogap .",
    "here we show that superconductivity survives when @xmath7 is located much deeper in the localized band than it was previously expected . in this regime",
    "the superconductivity develops against the background of the pseudogap and , thus , is characterized by a number of unconventional properties .",
    "we present the specific results for the tunneling density of states and tunneling conductance , andreev point - contact conductance , and spectral weight of high - frequency conductivity in this pseudogap superconductive state .",
    "finally , section [ summary of results ] reviews the main results and discusses a number of open problems .",
    "the appendices present technical details of virial expansion that was used as the one of methods for the determination of @xmath10 .",
    "quantum phase transitions from superconducting to insulating state in disordered conductors and artificial structures were studied intensively since mid-1980s , for review see e.g. reviewgoldman , finkelstein1994,faziozant . a number of theoretical models describing such transitions were proposed and studied but a fully coherent theoretical picture of this phenomena has not been established .",
    "we believe that such transitions might be driven by different mechanisms in different materials and thus belong to different universality classes which should be described by different models . below in this section",
    "we briefly review the alternative mechanisms and the theoretical methods employed for their description ( see also short review  @xcite ) . to avoid confusion",
    ", we note that the first and the second of the mechanisms described below will not be studied in the main part of our paper .",
    "we describe them in some detail mostly because we need these details in order to argue below in this section that they are not relevant for the superconductor - insulator transition in homogeneous amorphous films .",
    "macroscopic conductor that looks homogeneous at a macroscopic scale might be in fact composed of small grains or islands of  a good superconducting metal with transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "these grains are coupled to each other via low - transparency insulating tunnel barriers  reviewgoldman , faziozant , characterized by dimensionless tunnel conductances @xmath12 .",
    "the transition is due to the competition of the charging and josephson energies .",
    "exactly the same physics is realized in the artificial josephson junction arrays ,",
    "the only difference between the inhomogeneous films and artificial array is that the number of neighbors and of plaquette areas in the former are random .",
    "the simplest model describing this physics is given by effective hamiltonian written in terms of phases @xmath13 and charges @xmath14 assigned to grains : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the number of cooper pairs on the @xmath17-th grain , @xmath18 is the matrix of mutual capacitances , and @xmath19 is the josephson coupling energy , correspondingly .",
    "the model is often further simplified by assuming that @xmath20 is a non - zero constant only for nearest - neighboring grains while * *  * * the capacitance matrix is diagonal , @xmath21 .",
    "this model neglects the effects of the quasiparticles which might be ( sometimes ) justified for small grains at low temperatures @xmath22 , due to exponentially small density of normal electrons .",
    "the key parameter of the problem is the energy ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coulomb charging energy due to @xmath25 charge transfer . as was shown in the paper  @xcite the ground - state of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is insulating at @xmath26 and superconducting at @xmath27 , thus a phase transition(s ) takes place at @xmath28 .",
    "an essence of this phase transition is the mott - hubbard localization of cooper pairs , taking place when tunneling matrix element of a pair ( @xmath29 ) is much less than on - site repulsion @xmath30 .",
    "however , the model ( [ h1 ] ) is unlikely to describe correctly the physics of superconductor - insulator transition in josephson arrays or granular materials , especially in its simplified version with diagonal capacitance matrix .",
    "it has two important deficiencies .",
    "first , realistic josephson junction arrays and disordered films are poorly described by the model of diagonal capacitance matrix @xmath31 because normally the charging effects are controlled by capacitances of junctions @xmath32 , not by the ground capacitances of the islands ( see ref .",
    "it is in fact impossible to have a capacitance matrix dominated by the ground capacitance in the arrays which dimensionless normal state conductance is @xmath33\\gtrsim 1 $ ] because in these arrays the capacitance of the junctions can not be small .",
    "the reason for this is that apart from purely geometrical contribution @xmath34 , junction capacitance @xmath35 contains additional induced term @xmath36 , ( this expression is valid at @xmath37 ) .",
    "this induced contribution is due to virtual electron transition across the gap  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the charging energy can not be made arbitrary large ( equivalently capacitance can not be small ) : @xmath38 .",
    "josephson energy of the symmetric junction at low temperatures is @xmath39 , thus the condition @xmath40 can not be realized at large @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , at temperatures above the parity effect threshold @xmath42 , ( see  @xcite ) an additional contribution to the screening of coulomb interaction between cooper pairs comes from single - electron tunneling .",
    "thus , in all cases the effect of capacitance renormalization is that the ratio @xmath43 in granular arrays is controlled by the dimensionless conductance @xmath41 in such a way that coulomb effects are always weak at @xmath44 .",
    "ground capacitance larger than the junction capacitance thus implies that the transition into the insulating state would occur in the arrays characterized by very small @xmath45 .",
    "such behavior was never observed experimentally in josephson arrays ( see section [ experimental results ] ) .",
    "more realistic model involves the capacitance matrix that is dominated by the junctions capacitances with a small contribution from the ground capacitance of each grain . in this case",
    "the arguments of preceding paragraph show that the transition between the insulating and superconducting state should occur at @xmath46.@xcite moreover , deep in the insulating phase the electrostatic interaction between the charges in 2d josephson array becomes logarithmic in distance , similar to the one between the vortices in the superconducting phase .",
    "assumption of the full duality between vortices in the superconducting state and charges in the insulating state allows one to make a number of predictions.mfisher1990a,mfisher1990b for instance , because the current of vortices generates voltage while the current of pairs implies the electrical current one expects that superconducting - insulator transition is characterized by the universal value of @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite    unfortunately , despite a significant experimental effort the universal value of the resistance was never experimentally confirmed for josephson arrays and for most disordered films .",
    "moreover , in non - zero magnetic field the josephson arrays often show a large regime of the temperature - independent resistance .",
    "the reason for this is likely to be due to the important physical effects missed by the model ( [ h1 ] ) , namely the presence of random induced charge on the superconducting islands . as was shown in a number of josephson junction studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) the induced charge on each island exhibits very slow random fluctuations and is therefore inherently random variable .",
    "most likely the time dependence of these fluctuations can be neglected and the induced charge can be regarded as a quenched random variable @xmath48 that should be added to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) :    @xmath49    the properties of the model ( [ h_jj ] ) are not currently well understood ; in particular , it seems likely ( see @xcite ) but was not proven that insulating state has many glassy features responsible for intermediate normal phase .",
    "it is , however , clear that in this model the transition , or a series of transitions occurs at @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath51 in the normal state . near the critical point",
    "the gapless excitations correspond to collective modes build of electron pairs while the electron spectrum remains fully gapped . in analogy with spin glasses ,",
    "one expects that effective frustration introduced by random charges and magnetic field leads to a large density of low energy states .",
    "this might explain the observed temperature independent resistance that varies at least by one order of magnitude around @xmath52 as a function of magnetic field.@xcite    as we show in section [ experimental results ] both the data and theoretical expectations for models ( [ h1],[h_jj ] ) differ markedly from the behavior of the homogeneously disordered films .",
    "a spectacular property of the superconductor - insulator transition in granular materials is that a strong magnetic field applied to the system in the insulating regime results in a dramatic increase of the conductance .",
    "qualitatively , the reason for this behavior in granular systems is that in the absence of the field the single electron excitations are absent due to superconducting gap while pairs are localized due to coulomb energy and random induced charges .",
    "large field suppresses superconducting gap , which allows transport by individual electrons that is characterized by a much larger tunneling amplitude and lower ( by a factor of four ) effective charging energy .",
    "this effect was reported by @xcite where strong magnetic field was applied to al grains immersed into ge insulating matrix and giant negative magneto - resistance was observed .",
    "similar behavior was reported for homogeneous films of ino deep in the insulating regimegantmakher1996 .",
    "this similarity indicates that the main reason for this effect , which is that the pairing of the electrons survives deep in the insulating state , also holds for homogeneous films of ino .",
    "the quantitative theory of negative magnetoresistance in granular superconductors was developed in  @xcite for the case of relatively large inter - grain conductances @xmath53 , in which case the negative magnetoresistance effect is small as @xmath54 .",
    "recent review of theoretical results on normal and superconductive granular systems can be found in beloborodov .",
    "the scenario described above assumes that superconductivity remains intact inside each grain .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity by coulomb repulsion was developed by finkelstein  finkelstein1987,finkelstein1994 , building upon earlier perturbative calculations  @xcite .",
    "finkelstein effect becomes important for very thin strongly but homogeneously disordered films , as well as quasi-1d wires made out of such films  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the coulomb blockade scenario , the system is supposed to be `` uniformly disordered '' , with no superstructures such as grains coupled together by weak junctions .",
    "somewhat similar idea was proposed  @xcite for three - dimensional materials near the localization threshold .",
    "the essence of finkelstein effect is that coulomb repulsion between electrons gets enhanced due to slow diffusion of electrons in highly disordered film , which results in the _ negative _ contribution to the effective cooper attraction amplitude at small energy transfer @xmath55 : @xmath56where @xmath57 is dimensionless film conductance , @xmath58 is the `` bare '' cooper attraction constant defined at the scale of debye frequency @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the mean scattering time and mean free path , and @xmath63 is the film thickness .",
    "the suppression of attraction constant eq.([lambdafin ] ) leads immediately ( we assume here @xmath64 ) to the result obtained early on in the leading order of the perturbation theory  @xcite @xmath65the leading terms in the perturbation theory for @xmath10 can be summed by means of the renormalization group method developed in  @xcite . in the leading order over @xmath66 one gets @xmath67",
    "^{\\sqrt{2\\pi g } } ,   \\label{tc - fin}\\]]according to eq .",
    "( [ tc - fin ] ) , @xmath10 vanishes at the critical conductance @xmath68 , ( which needs to be large enough for the theory to be self - consistent ) . at lower ( but still large compared to unity ) conductances , the material never becomes superconducting ; it stays metallic at least down to very low temperatures @xmath69 where weak localization crosses over into the strong localization  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of superconductivity suppression , described by eq.(tc - fin ) , might be called `` fermionic '' , as opposed to the `` bosonic '' mechanism discussed in previous subsection  @xcite . within this mechanism ,",
    "superconductivity is destroyed at relatively large conductances @xmath70 , thus a _ direct _ superconductor - insulator transition does not seem to be a natural option .",
    "the theory of the superconducting - insulator transition outlined above neglects the mesoscopic fluctuations of the interaction constant , @xmath71 .",
    "this assumption was questioned on phenomenological grounds by kowal and ovadyahu @xcite .",
    "the role of these fluctuations become larger when superconductivity is strongly suppressed because as follows from ( [ lambdafin ] ) , in this regime even small mesoscopic fluctuations of @xmath72 lead to a large spatial fluctuations of the effective coupling constant @xmath73 . in its turn , the fluctuations of the effective coupling lead to the local spatial fluctuations of the transition temperature @xmath74 , which becomes very strong , @xmath75 , for nearly - critical conductance @xmath76 , as shown in ref .",
    "note that mesoscopic fluctuations of @xmath10 remain small in the universal case of short range disorder if coulomb suppression of superconductivity is not taken into account , even in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xmath77 at very low temperatures .",
    "spivakzhou1995,galitskiilarkin2001    these results demonstrate the inherent inhomogeneity of superconducting state near the critical point at which it is destroyed by disorder .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the regime close to the superconductor - insulator transition is described by the effective model of superconducting islands ( appeared due to spatial fluctuations of local attraction constant ) coupled by weak sns junctions . the theoretically consistent description of this physics is still lacking , the difficulty can be traced to the absence of tunnel barriers separating fluctuation - induced superconducting islands from the surrounding media . in the absence of these barriers charging effects become non - local which makes the determination of the effective coulomb energy a nontrivial problem , furthermore the presence of a large normal part implies dissipative ( non - local in time ) dynamics of the superconducting phase . a toy model of this type",
    "was solved in  feigelmanlarkinskvortsov2001 ; this model describes artificial superconductive islands in a good contact with disordered thin film .    in conclusion , in the fermionic mechanism",
    "the coulomb interaction is enhanced by disorder leading to the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "the state formed when the superconductivity is suppressed is likely to be a poor metal characterized by a large resistivity and finite density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the third alternative mechanism for the superconductor - insulator transition is due to the localization of single electrons . in this scenario",
    "the effects of coulomb interaction are neglected , whereas local ( in space ) cooper attraction is treated within standard bcs approximation . here",
    "we focus on the case of bulk disordered materials or sufficiently thick films in which localization remains a three dimensional effect .",
    "abrikosov and gorkov  ag1959 and anderson  @xcite have shown that potential disorder does not affect thermodynamic properties of usual s - wave superconductors .",
    "more precisely , this statement ( based upon the presence of time - reversal symmetry and called `` anderson theorem '' ) means that the parameter @xmath78 does not appear in bcs theory as long as magnetic field and/or supercurrent are absent .",
    "however , localization of single - electron eigenstates at very strong disorder leads to appearance of an additional energy scale @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the single - electron localization length and @xmath81 is the density of states ( per single spin projection ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath82 is just average level spacing inside typical volume where wavefunction is localized .",
    "one expects that at large @xmath82 the superconducting pairing between electrons is suppressed .",
    "competition between superconductivity and anderson localization was studied originally in mid-80 s  @xcite .",
    "their major conclusion was that anderson theorem is valid and superconductivity survives provided that the condition @xmath83is satisfied .",
    "the reasoning leading to eq.([cond1 ] ) is that for cooper instability to develop , characteristic energy spacing between hybridized cooper pairs ( which are supposed to be localized in the same region of size @xmath84 ) should be smaller than typical energy scale @xmath10 corresponding to the cooper instability . on the contrary",
    ", no superconducting long - range pairing seems possible when level spacing @xmath82 strongly exceeds @xmath10 , in spite of the presence of inter - electron attraction ( we assume that cooper attraction survives when the single electron states are localized as long as @xmath82 is much smaller than debye energy @xmath59 ) .",
    "we will show below that the analysis presented in  malee , bulasad , kapitulnikkotliar1986 is not complete in two important respects .",
    "first , the absence of long - range superconductive order does not necessarily mean that cooper pairing is totally negligible ; we will show that in the range @xmath85 cooper correlations leads to formation of the hard - gap insulator instead of usual variable - range one .",
    "this gap is of the same origin as the `` parity gap '' studied by matveev and larkin  @xcite in the context of ultra - small grains of good superconductive metal .",
    "second , the notion of _ eigenfunction fractality _ ( that was not known when the theorymalee , bulasad , kapitulnikkotliar1986 was developed ) has to be taken into account and leads to important physical consequences . in the present paper we are going to fill both these gaps ; it will be shown that fractality of electron eigenfunctions changes qualitative features of superconductive state , and even modifies the condition @xmath86 for the critical region where superconductivity is finally destroyed .",
    "more recently the issue of competition between localization and superconductivity was reconsidered in the important paper by ghosal , trivedi and randeria  @xcite .",
    "they considered two - dimensional lattice model of superconductivity with moderately strong local attraction ( negative - u hubbard model ) and on - site disorder and studied it numerically by two methods :  by solving the self - consistent bogolyubov - de gennes equations , and by solving bcs pairing equations in the basis of exact single - electron eigenstates .",
    "they demonstrated that with increase of local disorder superconducting state is transformed into the insulating one .",
    "the latter possesses sharp gap in the density of states but does not show coherence peaks .",
    "the energy gap was found to be non - monotonic as function of the disorder strength .",
    "it was also shown that superconductivity is very inhomogeneous in the crossover region , with disorder - generated `` islands '' of large pairing amplitude .",
    "we will see below that qualitative features of the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are very robust and survive in a continuum weak - coupling bcs model that we consider in the present paper ( see section [ model ] ) .",
    "the drawback of the treatment developed in ref .",
    "ghosal2001 is that it does not allow the quantitative analysis of the physical properties as function of main parameters of the problem ( coupling strength @xmath87 and proximity of the fermi - energy to the localization edge , @xmath88 ) , due to limitations imposed by purely numerical methods .",
    "a major drawback of most conventional numerical methods is their inability to study the regime characterized by dramatically different energy scales , in particular @xmath89 .",
    "development of the method to study this regime is the goal of the present paper .",
    "the importance of the analytical treatment of the weak coupling regime @xmath89 is demonstrated in particular , by the numerical work @xcite which has studied the 3d disordered hubbard model with strong local attraction ( 4 times larger than bandwidth ) . in this regime",
    "the electrons are strongly bound to each other even in translationally invariant systems .",
    "one expects that the mobility of the formed pairs is less than the mobility of the original electrons ; this enhances the effect of the disorder .",
    "this expectation is conformed by the data@xcite .",
    "we show that in the physically relevant regime of _ weak _ attraction , the situation is opposite : the superconductivity survives deep in the regime of localized states .",
    "phenomenologically one should distinguish at least three types of materials that display superconductivity suppression with the increase of the disorder : granular systems @xcite , nominally homogeneous films that exhibit superconductor - metal - insulator transition and homogeneous films that show direct superconductor - insulator transition.baturinareview2007 we shall discuss only the latter class in this paper , the materials that exhibit it are thick ( more than 20 nm ) ino@xmath8 films , thinner ( abound 4 nm ) tin films and very thin ( few atomic layers ) be films .",
    "recent work reports similar behavior also in disordered epitaxial films of nbn with varying disorder  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is twofold : to discuss the data that allow to exclude coulomb mechanisms ( both fermionic and bosonic ) of the superconductor - insulator transition in these films and to briefly summarize the data on these films that need theoretical explanation .",
    "we begin with the first .    the most direct experimental evidence that allows to exclude the fermionic mechanism of superconductivity suppression discussed in section [ coulomb suppression ] in homogeneously disordered films that exhibit direct superconductor - insulator transition comes from the recent tunneling data . in these experiments",
    "one observed that the suppression of the superconductivity either by disorder or temperature is _ not _ accompanied by the suppression of the gap , which remains intact or even increases reaching @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite instead , as the insulator is approached , one observes the disappearance of the local coherence peaks which , in addition , vary strongly from one point to another ( see also ref .",
    "this behavior ( and especially the temperature dependence of tunnelling conductance ) is in a striking contrast to what is expected for the fermionic mechanism .",
    "less direct evidence is provided by the data @xcite showing that superconductivity exists up to a very strong disorder corresponding to @xmath91 , which is at least a factor of two smaller than the one expected in the fermionic mechanism ( [ tc - fin ] ) .    as explained in section [ coulomb suppression ] the basis of",
    "the fermionic mechanism is the idea that coulomb repulsion is enhanced by disorder which results in the effective suppression of the attractive interaction that leads to superconductivity .",
    "the actual equations are derived in the assumption that bare coulomb repulsion is very strong but is reduced by screening to the universal limit in which the effective coulomb repulsion constant is equal to unity .",
    "the dimensionless parameter characterizing the strength of the coulomb interaction and its screening is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the residual conductivity and @xmath94 is the dielectric constant due to electrons far from the fermi energy ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "coulomb interaction is effectively strong provided that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the thomas - fermi screening length , @xmath98 is the coherence length in a dirty superconductor .",
    "if instead @xmath99 the coefficient in front of the logarithm in ( [ lambdafin],[tc - fin ] ) becomes small so that enhancement of coulomb repulsion become important only at exponentially low energy scales . in a very dirty metal ( such ino@xmath8film ) with a short mean free path @xmath100 and low carrier density @xmath101 ( see ref.@xcite ) the ratio @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the effects of coulomb interaction in these films become unimportant if dielectric constant @xmath103 .",
    "the direct measurements of the dielectric constant deep in the insulator regime give @xmath104  @xcite , one expects that it can be only larger in the vicinity of superconductor - insulator transition , so @xmath105 in these films which makes the fermionic mechanism irrelevant .",
    "the microscopic origin of this large dielectric constant is likely to be due to the low density of the carriers , @xmath106 in these conductors , and the peculiar structure of their density of states in which the fermi level is located in a large dip.@xcite . in this situation",
    "the density of the electrons distant from the fermi level , @xmath107 ) .",
    "this physics is due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction ; the estimates of the associated energy scales given below show that coulomb interaction is sufficiently well screened even in poor conductors so that the corresponding energy is too small compared with all other energy scales ; this rules out this possibility .",
    "these arguments are quite general and apply to other effects that originate from the long range part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we begin with energy scales that are known to be relevant experimentally for this problem .",
    "namely , the superconducting gap on the ordered side and activation energy on the insulating side .",
    "these energies are large : the superconducting gap is around @xmath108 while the activation gap is even larger @xmath109 ( see below ) .",
    "we now estimate the coulomb interaction at the scale of the superconducting coherence length , @xmath110 . because @xmath111 in these materials , this length , even for a very poor conductor , can not be too short : @xmath112 .",
    "large value of the dielectric constant in the parent insulating compounds , @xmath113 , implies that in the absence of the mobile electrons with @xmath114 , the effective charging energy at scales @xmath115 would be @xmath116 .",
    "screening by conduction electrons with energies @xmath117 decreases it further . to estimate this effect we note that at scales less than @xmath118 the properties of the electrons are similar to those at the mobility threshold . at the threshold",
    ", the dielectric constant grows with scale , @xmath80 , according to the scaling law @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "this results in the additional factor @xmath121 in the effective coulomb energy at scales @xmath110 which reduces it to @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the effective coulomb energy is much smaller that all relevant energy scales and can not be the driving force of the transition .",
    "note that this estimate becomes incorrect in the presence of thin insulating barriers between the grains , thus allowing for coulomb driven transition in inhomogeneous materials .",
    "the absence of structural inhomogeneities that might lead to such barriers in films of ino@xmath8 was shown in @xcite ; later studies@xcite also reported the absence of inhomogeneities in tin films .",
    "another argument against coulomb driven transition is provided by a completely different phenomenology of the transition in the films and in josephson arrays : in the former one observes direct transition to the insulating state characterized by a large gap and activation behavior of resistivity , the transition can be driven either by the increase of disorder or by magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , in josephson arrays the transition driven by the field is characterized by a large intermediate regime of temperature independent resistivity.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason to expect the disappearance of coherence peaks in some places and not in others as one approaches the transition ( reported in @xcite ) in the array of superconducting grains .",
    "finally , coulomb mechanism can not explain the large value of the activation energy in the insulating state in the vicinity of the transitions .",
    "one expects that when charging energy becomes large enough to suppress transport by cooper pairs , single electrons should dominate transport which implies activation energy equal to superconducting gap .",
    "instead one often observes large activation energies : @xmath123 in ino@xmath8 films ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) and even larger in be ones@xcite .",
    "we now summarize ( see also the review @xcite ) the phenomenology of the direct superconductor  insulator transition in homogeneous films as exhibited by three different systems : thick amorphous ino@xmath8 films shahar1992,kowal1994,gantmakher1996,shahar2004,shahar2005,steiner2005 , thin tin films  @xcite and extra - thin ( below 1 nm ) berillium films  @xcite ; somewhat similar phenomena were observed recently in the patterned bi film with honeycomb array of holes  @xcite .    1 .   on insulating side of sit ,",
    "low - temperature resistivity curves show simple activated behavior , @xmath124 , which crosses over into mott  @xcite , @xmath125 , or efros - shklovsky  @xcite , @xmath126 variable - range hopping _ at higher _ temperatures .",
    "this behavior is highly unusual : in hopping insulators where the activation is frequently observed at high temperatures it crosses over to some fractional ( variable - range ) behavior upon the temperature decrease .",
    "2 .   at high magnetic fields the films on both sides of the sit",
    "show large negative magnetoresistance gantmakher1996,shahar2004,shahar2005,steiner2005,adams2001,baturina2007,baturina2007a .",

    "in this section we develop approximation schemes to treat the cooper instability and superconducting order formation in the regime when the anderson theorem  @xcite is not valid due to very strong disorder .",
    "namely , in section [ modified mean - field ] we give two versions of the modified mean - field approximations , mfa , for determination of the superconductive transition temperature @xmath10 ; in section ginzburg - landau functional we derive an analog of the ginzburg - landau functional which is necessary to estimate the role of fluctuations beyond the modified mfa , and in section [ virial expansion ] we give an alternative method of @xmath10 determination : the virial expansion .",
    "the nature of approximations involved in the modified mfa and the virial expansion methods are very different , thus reasonable agreement between the results obtained by these methods indicates the validity of both of them .",

    "the critical temperature can be determined using the semi - analytical approach of virial expansion applied to the _ pseudo - spin hamiltonian_. the results of this section allow to suggest the pseudo - spin hamiltonian that provides a unified description of superconductivity in homogeneously disordered ( _ non - granular _ ) systems including the bcs regime and the region close to the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to develop two versions of a modified mean - field approximations that can be used to determine the critical temperature of a fractal superconductor .",
    "we start from the standard abrikosov - gorkov - anderson  @xcite mean - field equation for @xmath10 of a disordered superconductor : @xmath697the kernel @xmath698 is defined by @xmath699where @xmath178 are exact single - electron wavefunctions and @xmath700    within the standard mean - field approximation , one neglects the spatial variations of @xmath701 .",
    "then integrating over @xmath441 in eq.([mf ] ) and using the orthogonality and normalization of different single - particle wavefunctions one can eliminate all @xmath702 out of eq.([mf ] ) .",
    "note that it is only possible if the wave functions are real , @xmath703 , i.e. the time - reversal symmetry is preserved .",
    "this leads immediately to the well - known equation for @xmath5 in terms of dos function @xmath704 : @xmath705 where @xmath706 .",
    "however , the approximation of a constant @xmath132 can not be used under strong disorder conditions near the mobility edge .",
    "physically it is due to strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the local dos function @xmath707 , see @xcite .",
    "below we propose a modification of the mfa scheme which makes it possible to account for the major part of mesoscopic dos fluctuations .    to construct the modified mfa , we note that the appearance of the solution to the eq.([mf ] ) is equivalent to the divergence of the series @xmath708 . by dalambert criterion",
    "the latter is equivalent to the condition @xmath709explicitly , the trace @xmath710 can be written as @xmath711where @xmath199 is defined in eq.([melements1 ] ) .",
    "now we make a crucial approximation : we neglect all the _ off -diagonal matrix elements _ in eq.([melements1 ] ) with more than two different indices .",
    "the _ diagonal _ matrix elements @xmath712 with only two different indices will be retained . by so doing",
    ", we neglect thermal fluctuations of the superconductive order parameter ; we also neglect a part of mesoscopic fluctuations , whereas the most important type of the them ( i.e. fluctuations of the local density of states ) will be taken into account .",
    "thus our approach has a meaning of a modified mean - field approximation .",
    "the neglected off - diagonal terms determine the strength of fluctuations on top of the modified mfa solution .",
    "we derive the corresponding ginzburg - landau functional and estimate the role of such fluctuations in subsection ginzburg - landau functional below .",
    "there are two ways to impose the diagonal constraints  the for matrix elements @xmath199 : ( i ) to set @xmath713 thus imposing @xmath209 constrains in eq.([tr - tr ] ) , or ( ii ) to set @xmath714 or @xmath715 with @xmath716 . in this case one",
    "imposes @xmath717 constrains , so that only 2 summations will remain .",
    "as any summation gives a macroscopically large number of terms , one can neglect all terms corresponding to ( ii ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath718 .",
    "thus , upon neglect of off - diagonal matrix elements one finds eventually @xmath719where @xmath720 are defined in eq.([melements2 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show now that the condition given by eq.([dal ] ) , with @xmath710 defined by eq.([diag - app ] ) , is equivalent to the solvability condition for the equation @xmath721which is the basis of the modified mfa we will be using below .",
    "the set of new order parameters @xmath722 , entering eq.([tilde - fin ] ) , represent the superconducting `` ordering field '' acting onto a pair of electrons occupying the @xmath723-th orbital @xmath724 .",
    "the idea of the approximation is that , instead of using a constant ( in real space ) order parameter @xmath725 , we assume a _ smooth _ dependence of @xmath722 on the single - electron energies @xmath726 . under such an assumption , together with the replacement of @xmath720 matrix elements by their averages ( according to eq.([ij ] ) ) , the eq.(tilde - fin ) can be transformed into the integral equation @xmath727eq.([mmfa ] ) is a natural generalization of the bcs mean field equation which follows from it at @xmath728 .",
    "however , allowing for the energy dependence of @xmath589 may lead to drastic consequences .",
    "indeed , a simple scaling analysis of this equation with `` critical '' @xmath729 given by eq.([ij ] ) leads to the power - law dependence of the critical temperature on the attraction interaction constant @xmath222 : @xmath730where @xmath731 is defined in eqs.([chalk],[gamma ] ) .",
    "we encounter an unexpectedly strong increase of @xmath10 in the small @xmath215 limit with respect to the usual result , @xmath732 for a conventional bcs superconductor ( with the same @xmath733 ) .",
    "the price to pay for this increase is a very strong inhomogeneity in the real space of the local pairing amplitude : @xmath734the corresponding analysis will be presented in subsection [ pairing amplitude ] .    to demonstrate the validity of the solution ( [ deltar ] )",
    ", one needs to plug it into eq.([mf ] ) and to use `` diagonal approximation '' @xmath735 together with eq.([tilde - fin ] ) .    the transformation from eq.([tilde - fin ] ) to eq.([mmfa ] ) is not exact : we replaced the fluctuating matrix elements @xmath720 by their averages according to eq.([ij ] ) .",
    "thus eq.([mmfa ] ) contains an additional ( with respect to eq.([tilde - fin ] ) mean - field - type approximation .",
    "one can eliminate this additional approximation .",
    "for this purpose , let us define the new matrix @xmath736 and vectors @xmath737 : @xmath738then the solvability condition for eq.([tilde - fin ] ) transforms into the condition that the largest eigenvalue @xmath739 of the symmetric matrix @xmath736 becomes equal to unity .",

    "furthermore , increasing only the short range part of the coulomb interaction leads to the fermionic mechanism while increase in the long range part leads to the coulomb blockade with completely different properties .",
    "the transition between all these regimes are currently not understood , neither theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "it seems likely that at least one of these crossovers was observed as the region of poor scaling in @xcite .    the character of the quantum critical point that separates the fractal superconductivity and the insulator at @xmath598 deserves a further study .",
    "as discussed in section [ superconductivity with a pseudogap ] on both sides of this transition electrons are bound in the localized pairs , and the transition itself consists in development of phase correlations , well described in terms of the xy ordering of the anderson pseudo - spins @xmath1537 .",
    "this scenario is different from both `` bosonic '' and the `` fermionic '' mechanisms of superconductor - insulator transition , so we suggest the name `` pseudo - spin '' mechanism .",
    "the cavity approach to the study of such transitions was developed recently in @xcite ; the main qualitative conclusion of this study is self - organized inhomogeneity of the resulting superconductor in which phase correlations are dominated by the rare , almost one - dimensional paths .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results of the virial expansion method shown in fig .",
    "[ tcdistribution ] that point out to a percolation - like transition between the pseudo - gap superconductor and an insulator .",
    "another feature of this solution is a very rapid decrease in the transition temperature beyond certain value of disorder which might be seen experimentally as the apparent existence of the lowest nonzero @xmath1538 found in amorphous ino@xmath8 system  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to experimental findings that lack ( partially or entirely ) theoretical explanation .",
    "as discussed in section [ point contact tunneling ] the quantitative description of point contact tunneling requires the theory of collective modes in the fractal superconducting state . in the absence of such theory the spectacular , nearly rectangular shape of the _ local _ tunneling conductance @xmath1371 at low temperatures@xcite can not be explained quantitatively .    the theory of the hard - gap insulating state presented in section insulating state neglects the transport by cooper pairs and takes into account only single electron transport .",
    "it is therefore limited to the region relatively far from the transition such as studied in ref.shahar1992 .",
    "theory of the incoherent transport by cooper pairs close to the transition was discussed in the recent papers ioffemezard2009,muller2009 , the main conclusion of these studies is that very close to the transition the behavior of cooper pairs is controlled by the many body mobility edge which becomes zero exactly at the transition . away from the transition",
    "the theory predicts activated behavior at the lowest temperatures with the gap that increases fast away with disorder and becomes infinite a short distance away from the transition signalling the absence of incoherent transport by cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "recently the experimental paper  @xcite reported the anomalous size - dependence of the superconductor - insulator transition for extremely wide range of sizes between 1 and 150 microns .",
    "in particular , the workers observed a slow but significant dependence of the activation energy @xmath1539 on the system size @xmath80 ( the distance between the metal contacts ) on the insulating side of the transition . in one case",
    "@xmath1540 decreased from 13.5 k to 9.6 k while @xmath80 was changed from 145 to 12 microns at a fixed width .",
    "although the theory of the the incoherent transport by cooper pairs close to the transition @xcite predicts a strong size dependence at mesoscopic scales due to inhomogeneities , the size dependence at the huge scales observed experimentally are very difficult to explain .",
    "the explanation of this effect seems currently to be beyond the reach of a theory and presents a real challenge .",
    "a different set of challenges is presented by the superconductor - insulator transition induced by magnetic field for strongly disordered ( almost insulating ) superconducting samples .",
    "as one would expect , the critical field , @xmath1541 ( which corresponds to superconductor - insulator transition at @xmath1542 ) is a strong function of disorder , for instance , it varies over two orders of magnitude in the experiments@xcite . surprisingly , there are indications that phenomenology of the transitions driven by disorder and by magnetic field look differently   shahar1992,gantmakher1998,shahar2004,baturina2007a , steiner2008,sacepeshahar09 .",
    "namely , the critical point in disorder is characterized by the activated behavior of the resistance , @xmath1543 , with a large gap @xmath136 even very close to the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "in contrast , activated behavior , @xmath1544 , observed at fields above critical @xmath1541 is characterized by a small @xmath1545 which extrapolates to zero at @xmath1541 .",
    "in other words , the region in ( @xmath1546 ) plane where transport is characterized by activated behavior with a small gap has a peculiar wedge like shape as sketched in figure [ phasediagram ] ) .",
    "generally , one expects that very close to the critical line the transport is dominated by cooper pairs ; this expectation was experimentally confirmed for ultrathin bi films  @xcite . in this case",
    "the experimental phase diagram implies that the regime of cooper pair dominated transport is narrow in disorder but wide in field .",
    "qualitatively this is likely to be due to the fact that the effect of a small magnetic field is limited to the generation of local phase differences which have a large effect of the superconducting state but does not affect the incoherent transport of the pairs .",
    "however , there is currently no consistent theory of this effect . on the experimental side",
    ", it would be important to verify that the transport in this regime is due to cooper pairs for the ino and tin films .",
    "furthermore , strongly disordered superconductors show puzzling behavior in very large magnetic fields : their resistivity become temperature independent and approaches the quantum limit , @xmath128 .",
    "the field scale , @xmath1547 , at which this behavior sets in is not sensitive to the disorder in contrast to the critical field , @xmath1548 the second field scale appears first in the fractal superconductor : it is the field that destroys local cooper pairs and suppresses the hard gap @xmath610 . in this regime ,",
    "the parametric difference between @xmath1547 and @xmath1541 is due to the low fractal dimension @xmath1519 of a single - particle wave - function that suppresses the orbital effect of magnetic field on the pairing of two electrons localized on this eigenstate , similarly to a very thin wire .",
    "in contrast , long - range coherence requires the existence of large loops involving many localized cooper pairs .",
    "the typical size of these loops is larger than the localization length @xmath231 , leading to relatively small magnetic field scale @xmath1549 . in the pseudogap superconductor",
    "the second field scale is associated with the suppression of a large gap , @xmath610 , responsible for cooper pair formation whereas the critical field is associated with the frustration of a weak pseudospin coupling .",
    "thus , one expects even larger difference between the field scales in this regime .",
    "however , the universal value of the conductance in the regime @xmath1550 is not expected theoretically and remains mysterious .",
    "nernst effect can be potentially a very sensitive probe of the nature of the superconducting state.@xcite these experiments were performed recently on ino@xmath8 samples and show  @xcite nernst signal which scales as @xmath1551 , with the `` nernst exponent '' @xmath1552 at low magnetic fields .",
    "application of the conventional theory larkinvarlamovbook of the superconducting fluctuations to the nernst effect in 2d superconductors  @xcite gives nernst signal that scales as @xmath1553 at high temperatures .",
    "this behavior was indeed observed in conventional superconductor nbsi  @xcite . because nernst effect requires a motion of the electrical charge around the plaquette",
    ", the temperature dependence is expected to be different in discrete systems where motion around the minimal plaquette involve a large number of hops and each hop implies an extra power of @xmath1554 in the high temperature expansion  podolsky07 .",
    "for instance , because minimal plaquette on the hexagonal lattice contains six sites , one expects that @xmath1555 in this case .",
    "the striking difference between nbsi and ino@xmath8 behavior observed in  spathis on very low @xmath10 ( very disordered ) samples indicates , in our opinion , the importance of cooper pair hoping between localized sites .",
    "this behavior should get less pronounced further away from the transition , thus we expect that slightly less disordered samples will show more conventional exponent in nernst effect .    a number of papers noted the apparent similarity between phenomenology of disordered films of conventional superconductors discussed in this paper and that of high @xmath5 oxides.@xcite very briefly , the transport and magnetic measurements show the formation of pseudogap at temperatures much higher than superconducting @xmath5 in underdoped materials,@xcite while stm measurements display highly inhomogeneous order parameter ( as measured by coherence peaks ) combined with modestly homogeneous tunneling gap.@xcite furthemore , a number of indirect evidences points out to the superconducting nature of the pseudogap in these materials @xcite , similar to the situation discussed in this paper .",
    "the crucial difference between s - wave and d - wave pairing characterizing high @xmath5 oxides is that , in contrast to s - wave pairing , modest elastic scattering with mean free path of the order of superconducting coherence length suppresses the d - wave superconductivity .",
    "thus , localization of the wave functions is incompatible with generic d - wave superconductivity .",
    "this conclusion might need to be revised for the special case of superconductivity which is due to pairing of electrons in a small area of the full brillouin zone which might be the case of cuprates @xcite . in this case",
    ", the electrons that are responsible for the pairing belong to two well separated patches on the fermi surface with each patch characterized by a small momentum @xmath1556 .",
    "the density of states in these patches is large which makes scattering of these electrons strong .",
    "furthermore , because most impurities are located far from the conducting copper oxide planes , it is likely that the elastic scattering , though strong , does not mix different patches and thus does not inhibit d - wave pairing . in this situation",
    ", single electron states inside each patch may become very similar to the localized states discussed in this work making the developed theory qualitatively correct .",
    "this would explain the main phenomenological features mentioned above : formation of pseudogap far above @xmath5 , highly inhomogeneous order parameter observed in tunneling data , insulating behavior of lasrcuo superconductors in high magnetic fields , etc .",
    "finally , it is not clear why the phenomenology displayed by josephson junction networks@xcite was not observed in any disordered film . in particular , josephson junction networks close to superconductor - insulator transition are characterized by the appearance of a wide region of magnetic fields where resistivity has no temperature dependence but varies by many orders of magnitude as a function of magnetic field .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with the films that show more or less good crossing point of @xmath1557 isotherms .",
    "there is very little doubt that josephson networks are described by model hamiltonian ( [ h_jj ] ) , so one has to conclude that it is not the appropriate model for most films .",
    "one possible source of difference discussed above might be that many films are characterized by a large value of the dielectric constant , while another reason , relevant for the films with small dielectric constant , might be the capacitance matrix is not dominated by nearest neighbors in these films .",
    "nearest neighbor capacitance matrix translates into the coulomb interaction that decreases only logarithmically with distance in the josephson network as opposed to @xmath1558 expected in a film .",
    "the physical result might be the formation of the cooper pair glass in the josephson network but not in the disordered film or vice versa .",
    "if true , one expects that josephson networks with the coulomb interaction screened by the ground plate might display properties more similar to those of the films .",
    "another difference might be due to the fluxes produced by magnetic field are completely random in a disordered films but are ( almost ) identical on the plaquettes of the josephson lattice . in this case one",
    "expects to see film behavior in randomized josephson network .",

    "the even hilbert subspace of the problem of three sites with @xmath1565 or @xmath1231 electron on each site ( equivalent to the spin-@xmath1007 problem with three coupled spins ) consists of 8 basic states classified by the total spin .",

    "the hilbert space we considered so far corresponded to each orbital @xmath1592 occupied either by two electrons or empty .",
    "now let us consider the same hamiltonian , eq.([hamspin ] ) , but extend the hilbert space to include possible single - electron occupancies of all orbitals . to avoid unnecessary complications we omit here the hartree terms setting @xmath1593 in eq.([hamspin ] ) .",

    "each `` odd '' state has extra energy @xmath4 .",
    "it is important that the spin operator acting on the `` odd '' states @xmath1595the energies of the four states are ( we count all energies with respect to @xmath1596 ) : @xmath1597eq.([zero - s ] ) suggests that the `` partial susceptibilities '' @xmath1598 given by eq.([eigen ] ) are zero for all the odd states .",
    "this is because the hamiltonian eq.([hamspin ] ) does not couple the even and odd sectors of the hilbert space .",

    "however , not all the partial susceptibilities @xmath1612 are equal to zero .",
    "the reason is that the source terms @xmath1613 contain only one @xmath1614 operator whereas the number of sites is two",
