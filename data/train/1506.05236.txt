    "nonminimal field theory , which takes into account specific interactions of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , electromagnetic and gauge fields with space - time curvature , extends significantly mathematical and physical tools of theorists working in modern cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "for instance , the nonminimal coupling could explain the universe accelerated expansion , thus suggesting an alternative to introduction of an exotic cosmic substrate , the dark energy ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "nonminimal coupling of gauge , magnetic and electric fields to curvature is shown to be able to support the stability of traversable wormholes , thus suggesting an alternative to exotic ( phantom - type ) sources ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) .",
    "one can say that exact solutions to the nonminimally extended field equations form a very important supplement to the `` gold reserves '' of classical exact solutions obtained in the theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the main inconvenience of this nonminimal field theory seems to be connected with a large number of phenomenologically introduced coupling constants , appeared in the lagrangian of the theory .",
    "for instance , the nonminimal einstein - maxwell theory contains three generic coupling parameters ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) ; there are eight nonminimal coupling constants in the einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) ; the nonminimal einstein - maxwell - axion theory includes nine coupling parameters ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "two important questions arise in this context .",
    "the first one is : how one can reduce the number of nonminimal coupling parameters to a minimum .",
    "the second question is the following : whether there exist a unique nonminimal coupling parameter with the dimensionality of radius , the _ nonminimal radius _ ?",
    "we consider three methods to minimize the number of nonminimal coupling constants .",
    "first , one can use the requirements of regularity of the metric providing the following results : for spherically symmetric models we exclude distant singularities and eliminate the singularity in the center @xcite ; for the plane - wave symmetric models we require the metric determinant to be nonvanishing on infinite interval of retarded time @xcite . the second method is to introduce geometric analogs for the tensor of nonminimal susceptibility .",
    "the third idea is to reduce new nonminimal parameters to the known coupling constants .",
    "these three methods are illustrated below in the framework of three - parameter nonminimal einstein - maxwell model ( see sec .  [ secii ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the nonminimal radius of the spherically symmetric object , @xmath0 , by finding a boundary sphere , inside which the coupling of photons to curvature is the interaction of dominating type among ones forming gravity field .",
    "mathematically , this radius can be found as a position of the corresponding inflexion point of the metric function @xmath1 , i.e. , as the solution of the equation @xmath2 . in order to motivate such approach",
    "we consider , first , the zone of coulombian attraction ( repulsion ) in the exact regular solution for the electric field obtained in refs .   and ( see sec .",
    "[ seciii ] ) ; in this illustrating example the inflexion point separates the coulombian and nonminimal interaction zones .",
    "then we use the same idea searching for the inflexion points of the graphs for regular metric functions obtained in ref .   for black holes with regular electric field ( see sec .",
    "[ seciii ] ) , and in refs .   and for dirac - type monopole ( see sec .  [ seciv ] ) .",
    "in these examples two inflexion points are visualized : the first one can be used for distinguishing the newtonian - type attraction zone from the reissner - nordstrm - type zone of repulsion ; the second inflexion point ( closest to the center ) indicates the domain of dominance of the nonminimal interactions .",
    "section  [ secv ] contains discussions and some prospects .",
    "the three - parameter nonminimal einstein - maxwell model can be described in terms of the action functional @xmath3\\,,\\ ] ] where , in addition to the standard elements : the ricci scalar @xmath4 and maxwell tensor @xmath5 , the interaction cross - term with the tensor of nonminimal susceptibility @xmath6 is introduced .",
    "the tensor @xmath6 is given by the formula @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the ricci and riemann tensors , respectively , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the phenomenologically introduced coupling parameters @xcite . generally , the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are arbitrary and have the dimensionality of length in square .",
    "we think that the perfect nonminimal model has to contain only one fundamental parameter , say , @xmath13 , and all three parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 should be expressed in terms of @xmath13 using some linear relationships . as for the parameter",
    "@xmath13 itself , it can be either expressed in terms of well known fundamental constants , or be nominated as new fundamental coupling constant .",
    "a few versions are known , which realize this idea .",
    "the most known is the version of drummond and hathrell @xcite , based on one - loop corrections to quantum electrodynamics in curved space - time , for which @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the positive parameter @xmath13 is constructed by using the fine structure constant @xmath17 , and the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "there are a few models , in which the linear relations between @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are proposed using some mathematical and/or physical motives , but the essential parameter @xmath13 is uncertain .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "one can find the relations @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which guarantee the equations for the electric field potential @xmath23 , and metric @xmath24 to be of the second order in derivatives .",
    "keeping in mind that for this model ( indicated as the gauss - bonnet model ) the nonminimal susceptibility tensor @xmath6 is proportional to the double dual riemann tensor @xmath25 , we suggested in ref .   to use geometric analogies to link coupling constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 . for instance",
    ", one can use the condition @xmath26 , which means that left - dual nonminimal susceptibility tensor coincides with the right - dual one .",
    "this condition provides only one relation @xmath27 , and the second one is still necessary . as an alternative , we can consider the condition @xmath28 ( the trace of the nonminimal susceptibility tensor vanishes ) , which provides that @xmath29 .",
    "analogously , one can use the condition that @xmath6 is proportional to the difference between the riemann and weyl tensors , providing the relations : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "another idea is to define @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 so that the space - time metric , as the exact solution of the gravity field equations , is regular in the center . for instance , the conditions @xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 guarantee ( see refs .   and ) that the nonminimal monopole of the dirac type is regular everywhere . with the conditions @xmath30 , @xmath35 , @xmath32 ( see ref .  ) and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( see ref .  )",
    "we obtained exact solutions characterized by the electric field regular in the center .",
    "thus , using physical and geometrical analogies , we can reduce the set of three nonminimal coupling parameters , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , to the single coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "next problem with the identification of the nonminimal radius @xmath0 can be explained as follows .",
    "the simplest version is to consider @xmath36 , where the parameter @xmath37 with the dimensionality of length is defined using the nonminimal parameter @xmath13 only , @xmath38 . in this sense",
    "the drummond - hathrell radius @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 .",
    "but the definition @xmath41 is not unique . in ref .",
    "we faced with the exact solution to the nonminimally extended einstein - maxwell equations , which gives the following metric function @xmath42 : @xmath43 this exact solution describes the nonminimal extension of the reissner - nordstrm solution , where @xmath44 is the asymptotic mass of the object , @xmath45 is its total electric charge ( we use the system of units with @xmath46 ) . in order to visualize three typical radii it seems to be reasonable to rewrite this metric function as @xmath47 using the following definitions @xmath48 in this context the geometric mean @xmath49 seems to be appropriate nonminimal radius . of course",
    ", a physically motivated choice of the nonminimal radius can differ from @xmath50 by some numerical coefficient .",
    "in general case , using the model with arbitrary @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the metric @xmath51 we obtained the following asymptotical decompositions for big values of the radial variable ( see ref .  ):",
    "@xmath52 these formulas demonstrate that the deviations of the nonminimal solutions from the minimal reissner - nordstrm metric functions start with the terms of the fourth order in @xmath53 , and the physically motivated value of radius @xmath54 differs by the numerical coefficient @xmath55 only from the parameter @xmath56{2|q| gq^2}$ ] introduced above for the particular model ( @xmath57{2|q| gq^2}$ ] , where @xmath58 ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 can be indicated as nonminimal fine structure parameter ; below we discuss a few variants of identification of this quantity .",

    "the situation changes principally , when we discuss exact solutions obtained in the framework of nonminimal einstein - maxwell theory . in ref .   for the case",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath35 , @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) , we obtain the following exact solution to the nonminimally extended maxwell equations , describing static electric field of the spherically symmetric object @xmath66 \\ , , \\quad x = \\frac{r}{r_{q } } \\,.\\ ] ] this very illustrative exact solution is obtained for the specific model with @xmath67 , i.e. , when the parameter @xmath38 coincides with the electric radius @xmath68 .",
    "this solution has the standard coulombian asymptotic behavior at @xmath69 : @xmath70 in the center the electric field is regular and has a local maximum : @xmath71 the coefficient @xmath72 in the formula for @xmath73 is equal to the golden section @xmath74 , the limit to which the ratios of subsequent fibonacci numbers tend .",
    "since the derivative @xmath75\\ ] ] has only one root at @xmath76 and is negative at @xmath77 , the function @xmath78 has only one extremum , the maximum in the center .",
    "since @xmath79 , there is at least one inflexion point , @xmath80 , in which @xmath81 .",
    "numerical calculations show that this inflexion point is unique and is situated at @xmath82 .",
    "this means that we can indicate the sphere of the radius @xmath83 as the separatrix , which divides the 3-space into the zone of coulombian - type interaction , defined as @xmath84 , and the domain of nonminimal interaction , where @xmath85 .    for arbitrary @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath11",
    "the corresponding solution is much more sophisticated , but for illustration of the idea we can use the following asymptotic decomposition of the electric field : @xmath86 when @xmath32 and @xmath35 , we face with the same nonminimal radius @xmath87{2|q| gq^2}$ ] . when @xmath88 , formally speaking , the nonminimal radius can be defined alternatively as follows : @xmath89{|q_3|gm } = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{|q_3|}{4|q| } } \\cdot \\sqrt[3 ] { r^2_q r_{{\\rm g } } } \\ , .",

    "thus , we can state that in this model the newtonian - type attraction zone is situated at @xmath84 .",
    "the violation of the newtonian attraction law takes place due to the electric contribution , which forms the zone of repulsion with infinite barrier near the center .    [",

    "the metric functions can be now written in the form @xmath98 @xmath99 in order to simplify the formulas , we used in ( [ e9 ] ) the term @xmath78 from ( [ e1 ] ) .",
