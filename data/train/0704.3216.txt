    "the goal of the present article is to perform a generalization of the classical hartogs extension theorem in certain singular complex spaces which enjoy appropriate convexity conditions , using the method of analytic discs for local extensional steps and morse - theoretical tools for the global topological control of monodromy .    in its original form ,",
    "the theorem states that in an arbitrary bounded domain @xmath7 ( @xmath3 ) , every compact set @xmath8 with @xmath5 connected is an illusory singularity for holomorphic functions , namely @xmath9 ( for history , motivations and background , we refer _",
    "e.g. _ to @xcite ) . by",
    "now , the shortest proof , due to ehrenpreis , follows easily from the simple proposition that @xmath10-cohomology with compact support vanishes in bidegre @xmath11 ( _ see _ @xcite ) .",
    "along these lines and after results due to kohn - rossi , the hartogs theorem was generalized to @xmath12-complete complex manifolds by andreotti - hill @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ manifolds exhausted by a @xmath13 function whose levi - form has at least @xmath14 positive eigenvalues at every point .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for an approach via the holomorphic plateau boundary problem .",
    "to endeavor the theory in general singular complex spaces @xmath15 , it is at present advisable to look for methods avoiding global @xmath10 techniques , as well as global integral kernels , because such tools are not yet available .",
    "the geometric hartogs theory was attacked long ago by rothstein , who introduced the notion of @xmath16-convexity . on the other hand , within the modern sheaf - theoretic setting",
    ", the so - called _ andreotti - grauert theory _ allows to perform extension ( of holomorphic functions , of differentials forms , of coherent sheaves , _ etc .",
    "_ ) from shell - like regions of the form @xmath17 into their inside @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a fixed @xmath2-convex exhaustion function for @xmath20 . geometrically speaking ,",
    "one performs holomorphic extension by means of the _ grauert bump method _ through the level sets of @xmath19 in the direction of decreasing values , jumping finitely many times across the critical points of @xmath19 .    however , a satisfying , complete generalization of the hartogs theorem should apply to general excised bounded domains @xmath5 lying in an @xmath2-complete complex space @xmath21 , not only to shells @xmath22 relative to the @xmath2-convex exhaustion function .",
    "but then , after perturbing and smoothing out @xmath23 , one must unavoidably take account of the critical points of @xmath24 and also of the possible multi - sheetedness of the intermediate stepwise extensions .",
    "this causes considerably more delicate topological problems than in the well known grauert bump method , in which monodromy of the holomorphic ( or meromorphic , or sheaf - theoretic ) extensions from @xmath25 to @xmath26 with @xmath27 is almost freely assured , even across critical points of @xmath19 .",
    "considering simply a domain @xmath7 ( @xmath28 ) , with obvious exhaustion @xmath29 , the classical hartogs theorem based on analytic discs and on morse theory was worked out in @xcite , where emphasis was put on rigor in order to provide with firm grounds the subsequent works on the subject .",
    "the essence of the present article is to transfer such an approach to @xmath30-complete general complex spaces , where @xmath10 techniques are still lacking , with some new difficulties due to the singularities .",
    "thus , let @xmath31 be a reduced complex analytic space of pure dimension @xmath3 , equipped with an open cover @xmath32 together with holomorphic isomorphisms @xmath33 onto some closed complex analytic sets @xmath34 contained in balls @xmath35 , some @xmath36 . by definition ( @xcite ) , a @xmath13 function @xmath37",

    "a real - valued continuous function @xmath19 on @xmath20 is an _ exhaustion function _ if sublevel sets @xmath42 are relatively compact in @xmath20 for every @xmath43 .",

    "i.e. _ their levi - forms @xmath47 have at least @xmath48 positive eigenvalues at every point , for all @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath16-complete _ if it possesses a @xmath39 strongly @xmath16-convex exhaustion function .",
    "note that the @xmath52-complete spaces are precisely the stein spaces .",
    "we will mainly work with a _",
    "@xmath2-complete @xmath20 , and we recall that a reduced complex space @xmath53 is _ normal _ if the sheaf of _ weakly holomorphic functions _ , namely functions defined and holomorphic on the regular part @xmath54 which are @xmath55 on @xmath20 , coincides with the complete sheaf @xmath56 of holomorphic functions on @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath57 is of codimension @xmath58 at every point of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) and for every open set @xmath59 , both restriction maps @xmath60 are bijective has a neighborhood basis @xmath61 such that @xmath62 is connected ; also , @xmath63 itself is connected . the second statement is known as levi s extension theorem ( @xcite , p.  185 ) . ] , where @xmath64 denotes the meromorphic sheaf . to generalize hartogs extension , normality of @xmath20 is an unavoidable assumption , because there are examples of stein surfaces @xmath65 having a single singular point @xmath66 which are _ not _ normal ( @xcite , vol .",
    "ii , p.  196 ) , whence @xmath67 fails to be removable for holomorphic functions defined in a neighborhood of @xmath68 .",
    "we can now state our main result .",
    "let @xmath20 be a connected @xmath2-complete normal complex space of pure dimension @xmath28 .",
    "then for every domain @xmath69 and every compact set @xmath70 with @xmath5 connected , holomorphic or meromorphic functions on @xmath71 extend holomorphically or meromorphically and uniquely to @xmath1 : @xmath72    some comments on the hypotheses are in order .",
    "firstly , connectedness of @xmath20 is not a restriction , since otherwise , @xmath1 would be contained in a single component of @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , as @xmath20 is @xmath2-complete , @xmath73 has at least @xmath14 positive eigenvalues at every point @xmath74 , and consequently , each super - level set @xmath75 has a pseudoconcave boundary at every smooth point @xmath76 with @xmath77 and in fact , the levi - form of this boundary has at least one negative eigenvalue at @xmath78 .",
    "thirdly , by a theorem of ohsawa ( @xcite ) , every ( connected ) @xmath79-dimensional _ noncompact _ complex manifold is @xmath79-complete , and in fact , easy examples show that hartogs extension may fail : take the product @xmath80 of two riemann surfaces , with @xmath81 compact and @xmath65 _ noncompact _ , take a point @xmath82 and set @xmath83 ; by  @xcite , there exists a meromorphic function function having a pole of order @xmath52 at @xmath84 , whence @xmath85 does not extend through @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , in the category of strong levi - form assumptions , @xmath2-convexity is sharp .    for the theorem , the main strategy of proof consists of performing holomorphic or meromorphic extension entirely within the regular part of @xmath20 .    with @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath68 as in theorem  2.2 , holomorphic or meromorphic functions on @xmath86 _ { \\rm reg}$ ]",
    "extend holomorphically or meromorphically to @xmath87 .",
    "notice that both @xmath88_{\\rm reg}$ ] and @xmath87 are connected ( footnote  3 ) .",
    "then by  , extension immediately holds to @xmath1 .",
    "this yields theorem 2.2 if one takes the proposition for granted ; sections  3 and  4 below are devoted to prove this proposition .    for meromorphic extension , one could in principle well avoid the assumption of normality . in the case of meromorphic extension",
    ", we get a general result valid for reduced spaces without further local assumptions .",
    "let @xmath20 be a globally irreducible @xmath2-complete reduced complex space of pure dimension @xmath28 .",

    "the proof , also relying upon an application of proposition  2.3 , is postponed to section  5 ; an example in  5.1 shows that requiring only that @xmath5 is connected does not suffices .    for the proposition ,",
    "the main difficulty is that @xmath94 can in general cross @xmath5 .",
    "we will approach @xmath94 from the regular part and fill in progressively @xmath87 by means of the super - level sets of a suitable modification @xmath95 of the exhaustion @xmath19 , such that @xmath95 is still strongly @xmath2-convex but exhausts only @xmath63 in a neighborhood of @xmath96 . to verify that the extension procedure devised in  @xcite",
    "can be performed , preliminaries are required .",
    "to launch the filling procedure , we want to view the connected open set @xmath5 as a neighborhood of some convenient connected hypersurface @xmath97 contained in @xmath98 .",

    "whose closure contains the corresponding unique critical point @xmath332 , similarly as in  @xcite , three cases may occur :    * the domain @xmath333 grows regularly and continuously as @xmath310 decreases in a neighborhood of @xmath134 ; * precisely when @xmath310 becomes negative , the domain @xmath334 is merged with a second domain @xmath335 whose closure also contains @xmath66 for @xmath336 ( the case of three domains or more never occurs ) ; * the domain @xmath333 is contained in a bigger domain @xmath337 for all small @xmath338 , and exactly at @xmath336 , the closure of the domain @xmath339 is subtracted from @xmath340 , yielding a new domain @xmath341 which starts to grow regularly and continuously as @xmath342 for small @xmath343 .",
    "we then check by decreasing induction on @xmath299 that such domains are relatively compact and are either disjoint or one is contained in the other , and we achieve extension by means of @xmath2-concave levi - hartogs figures similarly as in  @xcite . but here , a single fact remains to be established , namely that the domains @xmath344 remain all contained inside the relatively compact region @xmath345 .",
    "this is true at the beginning of the filling process , namely for @xmath299 slightly smaller than @xmath346 , because @xmath347 is then diffeomorphic to a small spherical cap ( hence connected ) and the relatively compact domain enclosed by @xmath347 in @xmath348 is just the piece @xmath349 of @xmath120 , which is diffeomorphic to a thin cut out piece of ball close to @xmath97 and clearly contained in @xmath280 , since @xmath350 by * ( a)*.    to prove that all @xmath269 are contained in @xmath280 , we proceed by contradiction .",
    "let @xmath351 be first @xmath299 ( as @xmath299 decreases ) for which some @xmath281 is not contained in @xmath280 .",
    "in the process described above of constructing the domains @xmath352 , the only discontinuity occurs in * ( iii ) * and it consists of a suppression .",
    "consequently , the domains @xmath281 can not jump discontinuously across @xmath236 , hence at @xmath353 ( which might be either critical or noncritical ) , all @xmath354 are still contained in @xmath214 and the boundary of at least one domain , say @xmath355 , touches the @xmath44 border hypersurface @xmath356 .",
    "touch-mu-rho.pstex_t    on the other hand , by definition and by construction , for each @xmath299 , the boundary of each @xmath357 consists of two parts : @xmath358 , which is contained in @xmath97 , hence remains always in @xmath359 , together with a certain closed region @xmath360 contained in @xmath289 , with @xmath361 open and @xmath362 being the boundary in @xmath289 of @xmath363 .",
    "in fact , similarly as in section  5 of  @xcite , @xmath363 is always contained in @xmath364 and @xmath362 , always contained in @xmath365 is a @xmath13 real submanifold of @xmath63 of codimension @xmath14 provided @xmath299 is noncritical for @xmath300 , while @xmath366 may have as a single singular ( corner ) point @xmath66 for @xmath367 critical .",
    "but since @xmath362 is a subset of @xmath368 , it is always contained in @xmath280 .",
    "consequently , the boundary of @xmath369 can touch @xmath370 only at some point @xmath371 .",
    "so we have @xmath372 and @xmath373 , namely @xmath374 lies in @xmath375 and on the @xmath13 hypersurface @xmath236 .    by *",
    "( f ) * above , @xmath376 can not be a critical point of @xmath95 , whence @xmath377 and @xmath236 are both @xmath13 real hypersurfaces passing through @xmath374 .",

    "* , there is a complex line @xmath380 on which the levi - forms of both @xmath19 and @xmath95 are positive definite . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath381 is contained in @xmath260 , the levi - form of @xmath382 in the direction of @xmath383 should then be @xmath384 the levi - form of @xmath19 in the same direction .",
    "this is a contradiction , and the proof that all @xmath281 remain in @xmath280 is completed .",
    "this finishes our proof of proposition  4.1 .      as in section  2 of  @xcite ,",
    "one checks that extension holds from @xmath385_{\\rm reg}$ ] to @xmath87 provided holomorphic or meromorphic functions defined in the thin tubular neighborhood @xmath272 of @xmath386 do extend uniquely to @xmath387 .",
    "so we work with @xmath97 , @xmath272 and @xmath6 , and since everything is exhausted as @xmath388 , the conclusion of the proof of proposition  2.3 is an immediate consequence of the following .    for",
    "every regular value @xmath389 of @xmath300 , holomorphic or meromorphic functions defined in @xmath272 do extend holomorphically or meromorphically and uniquely to @xmath390    we set @xmath391 .",
    "there is a unique `` @xmath95-farthest point '' @xmath392 with @xmath393 and this point is obviously a critical point of morse index equal to @xmath394 for @xmath300 , by virtue of * ( g)*. consequently , for all @xmath395 close to @xmath396 , there is a single connected component in @xmath273 , namely @xmath273 itself , which is diffeomorphic to a small spherical cap and encloses the domain @xmath397 , diffeomorphic to a thin cut out piece of ball . for such @xmath395 close to @xmath396 ,",
    "the proposition is thus a direct consequence of the previous proposition  4.1 .    for arbitrary noncritical @xmath299 ,",
    "there is a well defined connected component @xmath398 of @xmath399 with @xmath400 , and we denote by @xmath401 the other connected components of @xmath399 .",
    "also , each connected component @xmath402 of @xmath349 is bounded by some of the @xmath403 , inside @xmath271 .",
    "the problem is that the various extensions provided by proposition  4.1 need not stick together , but fortunately , we can go to deeper super - level sets @xmath404 .    for every @xmath405 with @xmath406 which is noncritical for @xmath300",
    ", the @xmath95-farthest point @xmath407 belongs to a unique connected component @xmath408 of @xmath409 and the enclosed domain @xmath410 constructed by proposition  4.1 contains @xmath120 in a neighborhood of @xmath407 .    indeed ,",
    "if this were not true , there would exist the first @xmath411 ( as @xmath412 decreases ) for which @xmath410 switches to the other side of @xmath97 near @xmath407 . according to the topological combinatorial processus * ( i ) * , * ( ii ) * , * ( iii ) * above , this could only occur in case * ( iii ) * with @xmath351 critical , where a component is suppressed from a bigger one @xmath413 bounded by some @xmath414 , the suppressed component necessarily being @xmath354 itself .",
    "then the bigger component @xmath413 would contain the side of @xmath97 which is exterior to @xmath120 near @xmath415 , whence @xmath416 would necessarily be @xmath417 , which contradicts @xmath418 .",
    "deepening.pstex_t    next , since @xmath97 is connected ( according to lemma  3.2 ) , we can pick a @xmath44 jordan arc @xmath419 running in @xmath97 which starts at @xmath407 and visits every other connected component @xmath420 of @xmath399 .",
    "since @xmath419 is compact , there is a noncritical @xmath421 such that @xmath422 .",
    "fix such a @xmath405 and denote by @xmath408 the connected component of @xmath423 to which @xmath407 belongs . then let @xmath410 be as in lemma  4.4 .",
    "the domain @xmath410 contains @xmath349 .",
    "near @xmath407 , this domain already contains a piece of @xmath120 thanks to lemma  4.4 . from the beginning , @xmath97 is oriented , since it bounds the domain @xmath120 .",
    "thus , we can push @xmath419 slightly inside @xmath120 , getting a curve @xmath424 almost parallel to @xmath419 which is entirely contained in @xmath120 , and also contained in @xmath404 if the push is sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , @xmath424 is also entirely contained in @xmath425 , because the extensional domain @xmath426 is , at least near @xmath407 , located on the same side ( with respect to @xmath97 ) as @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath402 be any connected component of @xmath349 . by construction",
    ", @xmath424 visits @xmath402 .",
    "thus , every point of @xmath402 may be joined to some point of @xmath424 by means of some auxiliary @xmath13 curve running in @xmath402 .",
    "all such auxiliary curves do not meet @xmath97 , hence they do not meet @xmath408 , whence they all run in @xmath410 .",
    "consequently , by means of @xmath424 and of the auxiliary curves in each @xmath402 , we may connect , without crossing @xmath97 even once , every point of @xmath349 with the starting point of @xmath424 , contained in @xmath410 near @xmath407 .",
    "thus @xmath349 is effectively contained in @xmath410 .",
    "to conclude , an application of proposition  4.1 yields unique extension to @xmath427 , and by plain restriction , we get unique extension to @xmath428 .",
    "this completes the proofs of propositions  4.3 and  2.3 .",
    "to see that the weaker assumption that @xmath5 is connected does not suffice , we consider @xmath429 , the euclidean @xmath430 with two points identified . if we define the structure sheaf by @xmath431 at all single points and by @xmath432 at the double point @xmath433 , the space @xmath434 is reduced and modelled near @xmath433 on @xmath435 .",
    "this makes it easy to check that the function @xmath436 descends to a 1-convex exhaustion of @xmath20 via the quotient projection @xmath437 .",
    "letting @xmath438 and latexmath:[$k : = \\pi \\big(\\ {        to begin with , we observe that proposition 2.3 carries over without change to the more general setting of theorem 2.4 : indeed , thanks to the connectedness of @xmath443_{\\rm reg}$ ] , we may construct @xmath97 and @xmath120 as in lemma  3.2 ; the construction of an almost psh function @xmath174 with @xmath205 holds without assumption of normality ( @xcite ) , and then propositions  4.1 and  4.3 do go through ( notice that both @xmath91 and @xmath87 are connected ) .",

    ", we can extend through all points of @xmath459 with @xmath460 .",
