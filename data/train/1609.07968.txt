    "ct14 parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite are obtained in a global analysis of a variety of hadronic scattering experimental data .",
    "they are suitable for general - purpose qcd calculations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and in other experiments .",
    "the previous generation of general - purpose pdfs from cteq - tea ( ct ) group , designated as ct10  @xcite , was used in a wide range of analyses in hadron collider phenomenology .",
    "the ct10 pdfs were based on diverse experimental data from fixed - target experiments , hera and the tevatron collider , but without data from the lhc .",
    "the ct14 global analysis represents the upgrade of the ct10 fit and includes data from the lhc run i , as well as updated data from the tevatron and hera experiments .",
    "the ct14 pdf sets are available at lhapdf  @xcite together with recent pdf parametrizations from other groups  @xcite .",
    "the latest version of the pdf4lhc recommendation  @xcite provides users with a consistent procedure on how to combine the ct14 , nnpdf , and mmht pdf sets in phenomenological analyses .",
    "the ct14 pdfs are determined from data on inclusive high - momentum transfer processes , for which perturbative qcd is expected to be reliable .",
    "for example , in the case of deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) , only data with @xmath1 gev and @xmath2 gev@xmath3 are used , where mass squared of the final state hadronic system @xmath4 .",
    "data in this region are expected to be relatively free of non - perturbative effects , such as higher - twist or nuclear corrections . in the global analysis ,",
    "the hera run i inclusive dis measurements have imposed important pdf constraints in the ct10 and ct14 analyses .    in 2015 ,",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations released a novel combination of measurements of inclusive deep - inelastic scattering cross sections at @xmath5 collider hera  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this data ensemble as hera2 throughout this paper , to be distinguished from the previous combination of hera data sets on dis published in 2009 @xcite , which we will call hera1 .",
    "hera2 is the combination of hera run i measurements of about 100 pb@xmath6 of @xmath7 and 15 pb@xmath6 of @xmath8 data , and run ii measurements of 150 pb@xmath6 of @xmath7 and 235 pb@xmath6 of @xmath8 data , resulting in a total integrated luminosity of approximately 500 pb@xmath6 .",
    "the individual h1 and zeus measurements used in the combination were published previously in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the two collaborations employed different experimental techniques and used different detectors and methods for kinematic reconstruction .",
    "therefore the new hera2 _ combined _ measurements exhibit a significantly reduced systematic uncertainty .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of the hera2 measurements on the ct14 global analysis .",
    "we replace the combined hera1 data set used in the published ct14 pdfs  @xcite by the hera2 set and examine the resulting changes in pdf central values and uncertainties . also , we study the dependence of the goodness - of - fit upon kinematic cuts on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as it was suggested  @xcite that the low @xmath11 hera2 data are not well fitted by the ct10 and ct14 pdfs .",
    "related studies of the impact of hera2 data in the context of mmht14 and nnpdf3.0 fits can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to this end",
    ", the cteq - tea pdfs have been refitted at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) by using the global ct14 data ensemble , but with the hera2 measurements in place of hera1 .",
    "the new pdfs obtained after the refitting procedure are named ct14@xmath12 , to distinguish from ct14 .",
    "the hera2 data set has 1120 data points in the fitted region with @xmath13 gev and @xmath2 gev@xmath3 .",
    "there are 162 correlated systematic errors , and 7 procedural uncertainties , in addition to the luminosity uncertainty . when hera2 is included in the global fit , there are in total 3287 data points in the data ensembles , compared to 2947 in the original ct14 fits .",
    "this is because two other changes have been made in the data analysis .",
    "first , we have dropped the nmc muon - proton inclusive dis data on @xmath14  @xcite , because that data can not be fitted well . as concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nmc @xmath15 proton data is influenced by some unknown or underestimated systematic errors .",
    "meanwhile , we continue to include the nmc proton to deuteron ratio data on @xmath16 .",
    "second , we updated the data table for the cms 7 tev @xmath17 inclusive jet experiment  @xcite , which became available after the completion of the ct14 study , without appreciable effects on the pdfs .",
    "as in ct14  @xcite , the theoretical predictions for the majority of processes in the fit are calculated at the nnlo level of accuracy .",
    "in particular , a nnlo treatment  @xcite of heavy - quark mass effects in neutral - current dis is realized in the s - acot-@xmath18 scheme  @xcite and is essential for obtaining correct predictions for lhc electroweak cross sections  @xcite . however , the calculations for charged - current dis and inclusive jet production are included at nlo only ; in both cases , the complete nnlo contributions are not yet available . in the sec .",
    "ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , we presented various arguments suggesting that the expected impact of the missing nnlo effects in jet production on the pdfs is small relatively to current experimental errors .",
    "similarly , the nnlo contribution to charged - current dis , including massive charm scattering contributions @xcite , is modest compared to the experimental uncertainties .    it is useful to review quickly the advances in the ct14 global analysis , compared to ct10 . _ regarding data : _ the new lhc measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "cross sections  @xcite directly probe flavor separation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 partons in an @xmath10-range around @xmath23 that was not directly assessed by earlier experiments .",
    "the updated measurements of electron charge asymmetry from the d   collaboration  @xcite probe the @xmath24 quark pdf at @xmath25 .",
    "these measurements are included in the ct14 and analyses .",
    "_ regarding parametrization : _ in the ct14 analysis , the description of variations in relevant pdf combinations , such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is improved , as compared to ct10 , by increasing the number of free pdf parameters from 25 to 28 .",
    "the functional form for the initial scale pdfs adopted by the ct14 fit is parametrized by bernstein polynomials ( reviewed in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which have the property that a single polynomial is dominant in any given @xmath10 range , hence reducing undesirable correlations among the pdf parameters that sometimes occurred in ct10 .",
    "also , in the asymptotic limits of @xmath28 or @xmath29 , the ct14 functional forms allow the ratios of @xmath30 or @xmath31 to reach any values , so that these ratios will be determined by the global fit ; this is in contrast to the more constrained behavior of those pdf ratios assumed in the ct10 parametrization forms .",
    "the fit adopts the same functional form for the initial scale parametrization as ct14 , except for the strange quark and antiquark pdfs .",
    "more specifically , in the ct14@xmath12 analysis , we have used the ct14 pdf functional form  @xcite at the initial scale @xmath32 , @xmath33 where the @xmath34 functions are linear combinations of bernstein polynomials . in the ct14 fit  @xcite , the strange quark pdf is parametrized according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : par ] ) , with @xmath35 being a constant . there ,",
    "we have tied @xmath36 to the common @xmath36 of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and assumed @xmath39 in the analysis .",
    "thus , we have just two parameters for the strange quark and antiquark pdfs in our standard ct14 analysis : @xmath40 and normalization . with this limitation on @xmath41",
    ", we find that it is necessary to extend the strange quark uncertainty by adding two `` extreme strange '' pdfs to the set of hessian error pdfs . in the ct14@xmath12 pdfs",
    ", we use a different technique to avoid underestimating the strangeness uncertainty provided by the hessian error pdf set : while in the published ct14 pdfs , we set @xmath42 , in fit , we allow @xmath43 to differ from @xmath44 . by freeing the parameter @xmath45 , we find that it is not necessary to construct additional extreme strange quark pdfs .",
    "so , whereas the ct14 error pdfs include two `` extreme strange '' and two `` extreme gluon '' pdfs , the ct14@xmath12 error pdfs include only two `` extreme gluon '' pdfs to model the uncertainty of gluon pdfs in the very small @xmath10 region .",
    "thus the total number of error pdfs is the same for ct14 and ct14@xmath12 , _ viz .",
    "_ 58 error pdfs .",
    "to summarize , we use this parametrization , differing from the standard ct14 parametrization @xcite only by the addition of one free parameter for @xmath41 ; and we refit the ct14 data set , with the hera1 combined data replaced by the hera2 combination , after dropping the nmc muon - proton inclusive dis data on @xmath46  @xcite and correcting the data table for the cms 7 tev @xmath17 inclusive jet experiment  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper summarizes findings of the global analysis , presented in several parts :    * section 2 concerns the goodness - of - fit for this new qcd global analysis with special emphasis on the quality of the fit to the hera2 combined data .",
    "we find a large value of @xmath47 for a subset of the hera2 measurements , from @xmath8 scattering , and we discuss the origin of this increase . * section 3 describes a study of the role of hera2 data points at low @xmath9 .",
    "this is studied by excluding low-@xmath9 data points and refitting the pdfs .",
    "* section 4 concerns the changes of the pdfs themselves .",
    "we find some changes from ct14 to , but they are not significant within the standard cteq estimates of pdf uncertainties .",
    "* section 5 is a summary of our conclusions .    in the end",
    ", we find that the differences between ct14@xmath12 and ct14 pdfs are smaller than the uncertainties of the pdfs , as estimated by the hessian method of error propagation .",
    "for this reason we reckon that the standard ct14 pdfs should continue to be used for making predictions to compare against current and future lhc data .",
    "however , we will make the ct14@xmath12 pdfs available in the lhapdf format for specialized studies , such as those that are sensitive to behavior of strange ( anti)quark pdfs .",
    "as we explained in the introduction , when constructing a pdf ensemble for general - purpose applications , the cteq - tea global analysis selects the experimental data points at large enough @xmath9 and @xmath48 , where contributions beyond the leading - twist qcd are reduced .",
    "with the default lower @xmath9 cut on the selected data points , @xmath49 gev , the hera1 ensemble contains 579 data points , while that of hera2 contains 1120 data points . in table",
    "[ tbl : tbl1 ] we summarize the results for the total @xmath50 values of the hera1 combined data ( column 2 ) and hera2 combined data ( column 3 ) , for both nlo and nnlo approximations of qcd .",
    "the rows ct14(nlo ) and ct14(nnlo ) use the published ct14 pdfs , with no refitting ; they were fit with hera1 data .",
    "the rows nlo10 , nlo55 , nnlo10 and nnlo55 are refits with a slightly more flexible parametrization for the strange quark pdf and the inclusion of the non - hera data sets , as described in section i ;",

    "the slow oscillations in @xmath92 reflect the behavior of bernstein polynomials in eq .",
    "the strange quark central pdf is reduced over the entire @xmath10 range , mainly due to the change of freeing one shape parameter for describing the strange ( anti)quark pdf ; but this reduction is statistically insignificant and completely within the uncertainty of the previous pdf ensemble .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the parton distribution functions , constructed from a global analysis of qcd that uses the hera run i and ii combined data set on @xmath111 deeply inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "this compendium of 20 years of hera data , reconciled as well as possible , including comparative analysis of systematic errors from the two collaborations , h1 and zeus , provides the most comprehensive information about dis available today .",
    "a comparison of the current qcd analysis of this data ( hera2 ) to the ct14 global analysis of the previous generation of hera data ( hera1 ) yields important insights about the structure of the nucleon , at the highest precision achieved .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to examine the quality of agreement of perturbative qcd predictions with the hera2 data and discuss the impact of these data on the pdfs and their uncertainties used for a variety of lhc applications .",
    "we conclude that the and ct14 pdfs , do have some differences . however , the differences are smaller than the pdf uncertainties of the standard ct14 analysis .",

    "@xmath66 is marginally smaller in the nlo analysis than at nnlo , but the difference is clearly negligible . in either case , @xmath51 decreases as hera2 data is included with increasing weight , at about the same rate for nlo and nnlo .",
    "* figures 4 and 5 show that hera2 data slightly modify the @xmath112 , @xmath24 , and @xmath113 pdfs .",
    "the @xmath96 pdf decreases , mainly due to the use of a slightly more flexible parametrization for the strange quark pdf .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath115 pdfs decrease at large @xmath10 , where @xmath112 and @xmath24 pdfs increase , so as to satisfy the momentum sum rule .",
    "the most significant effects of the hera2 data in the analysis are seen in the ratio of @xmath102 which is greater than 1 for very large @xmath10 , although this change is much less than the size of the error band .",
    "also , the strangeness fraction @xmath106 is roughly 20% smaller than the standard ct14",

    "this is mainly caused by the reduction in the strange quark pdf .",
    "because the ct14 and pdfs agree well within the pdf errors , we do not expect noticeable differences in their predictions for experimental observables at the lhc .",
    "we have explicitly checked that using and ct14 pdfs at nnlo give almost the same predictions for the cross section for @xmath116 and @xmath117 production  @xcite , as well as the associated @xmath116 and charm production  @xcite , at the lhc energies .    in future ct analyses",
    "we may employ the hera2 combined data as an important part of the global data set , together with the new lhc data that will be published , such as low- and high - mass drell - yan processes and top quark differential distributions .",
    "for the present , continue to recommend ct14 pdfs for the analysis of lhc run 2 experiments .",
