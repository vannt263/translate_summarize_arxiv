    "due to the asymptotic freedom feature of qcd , it is expected that the qcd matter will undergo a phase transition from hadronic phase to the quark gluon plasma phase at sufficient high energy density .",

    "i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath8 , if @xmath13 symmetry is restored the relevant symmetry is @xmath14 and the transition is likely first order ; if @xmath13 symmetry is broken the relevant symmetry becomes isomorphic to that of the 3-d o(4 ) spin model and the transition becomes second order belonging to that universality class . in the intermediate quark mass region , there is no real phase transition but a ( rapid ) crossover takes place from the hadronic phase to the quark gluon plasma phase .",
    "all the first order phase transition regions are separated from the crossover by lines of second order phase transitions belonging to the 3-d ising @xmath15 universality class .",
    "thus the first order region for @xmath9 case , the second order o(4 ) line for @xmath11 case and the second order @xmath15 line are supposed to meet at a tri - critical point characterized by a certain value @xmath16 of the strange quark mass . for the system with massless",
