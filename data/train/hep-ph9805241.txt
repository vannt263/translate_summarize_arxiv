    "the development of heavy quark theory started in the 1980 s , has essentially been completed . while at the early stages the main emphasis was placed on the symmetry aspects ( the so - called heavy quark symmetry ) , the present ( mature ) stage deals with dynamical aspects .",
    "a formalism based on wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite has been developed and applied to many cases of practical interest , in particular to inclusive decays of heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "the theory of such decays is at a rather advanced stage now ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "calculations we could not even dream of several years ago have become possible .",
    "the decays of heavy flavor hadrons @xmath2 are shaped by nonperturbative dynamics . while qcd at large distances is not yet solved ,",
    "considerable progress has been achieved in this problem .",
    "the width of an inclusive transition @xmath3 is expressed through an ope .",
    "the nonperturbative effects are then parameterized through expectation values of various local operators @xmath4 built from the quark and/or gluon fields .",
    "observable quantities , such as semileptonic and nonleptonic widths of heavy hadrons @xmath2 , are then given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the ope coefficients , and @xmath7 stands for a normalization point separating out soft contributions ( which are lumped into the matrix elements @xmath8 ) from the hard ones ( which belong to the coefficient functions @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are many subtle and interrelated issues , both conceptual and technical , associated with the operator product expansion in qcd :    1 .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) represents an expansion in powers of @xmath1 with @xmath9 being the @xmath10 quark mass and the coefficients @xmath6 scaling like @xmath11 for an operator with dimension @xmath12 . in @xmath13",
    "there are two sources for contributions depending on powers of @xmath1 , namely higher - dimensional _ operators _ and higher - order terms in the expansion of their _",
    "expectation values_. in addition every coefficient @xmath14 is a series in the running coupling @xmath15 , of which only a few terms are known for a given coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "this immediately raises a grave concern : how can we retain terms suppressed by powers of @xmath1 without a complete summation of the parametrically larger powers of @xmath16 in the leading coefficient ? 2 .",
    "although the normalization point @xmath7 conceptually represents a straightforward  book - keeping \" device for separating hard and soft contributions , it is technically difficult to actually carry out such a program since no user - friendly definition of what is soft and hard exists in qcd .",
    "so far , the vast majority of all discussions related to the introduction of @xmath7 are conducted in a hand - waving manner .",
    "it is quite conceivable that there are _ hard _ _ non_perturbative contributions in the coefficient functions : @xmath17 with @xmath18 being some positive number .",
    "the possible size of such contributions is essentially unknown .",
    "a related problem is the convergence ( or divergence ) of the perturbative series for the coefficient functions @xmath6 .",
    "4 .   truncating the series ( [ gamma ] ) at some finite order introduces an error estimated by so - called exponential terms , which in euclidean domain look as expressions of the type @xmath19 $ ] . in order to obtain @xmath13",
    "we analytically continue from the euclidean domain , where the ope is well defined and the coefficients @xmath6 are real , to the minkowski domain where they acquire an imaginary part .",
    "such analytic continuation is implicit in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and is based on the assumption of smoothness . under analytic continuation",
    "the exponential terms convert themselves into _ oscillating _ terms of the type @xmath20 $ ] @xcite ; the expansion ( [ gamma ] ) does not account for them .",
    "it can thus be understood on general grounds that duality violation is described  or at least modeled  by oscillating expressions .",
    "to which degree those are suppressed by powers of @xmath1 depends on details of the strong interactions and the specifics of the process .",
    "all these questions are circumvented in the so - called _ practical version _ of ope @xcite routinely used so far in all instances when there is need in numerical predictions .",
    "this version is admittedly approximate , however .",
    "the questions formulated above are legitimate ; they deserve to attract theorists attention , and continue to cause confusion in the literature .",
    "they have to be addressed also because they are emerging as a major source of the uncertainties in quantitative predictions ; these problems have specifically been suspected to underlie phenomenological difficulties encountered recently , e.g. a relatively short lifetime of beauty baryons and a relatively small semileptonic branching ratio of beauty mesons .",
    "we find it useful and instructive to study all these issues in models that while retaining basic features of qcd  most notably quark confinement  are simpler without being trivial and can be solved dynamically .",
    "qcd defined in one time and one space dimension",
    " hereafter referred to as 1 + 1 qcd  is especially suitable for this purpose : with the coulomb potential necessarily growing linearly in two dimensions , quark confinement is built in .",
    "likewise the theory is superrenormalizable , i.e. very simple in the ultraviolet domain .",
    "there are no logarithmically divergent",
    " tails \" in the feynman graphs . as a result ,",
    "the book - keeping of ope ( separation of the hard and soft parts ) becomes simple , and all subtle aspects in the construction of the ope can be studied in a transparent environment .    in particular , the perturbative contributions in the coefficients @xmath6 become an expansion in @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the gauge coupling in 1 + 1 qcd ) .",
    "they are thus power - suppressed in the same way as the higher - dimensional operators ; the first problem formulated above therefore does not arise here . without the logarithmic uv tails",
    "the second problem becomes tractable .",
    "concerning the third problem it is easy to see that in 1 + 1 qcd nonperturbative corrections can not generate power suppressed terms in the coefficients @xmath6 .",
    "for the leading operator @xmath23 we will find its coefficient function to all orders of perturbation theory ( in the limit of @xmath24 ) , demonstrating the convergence of the perturbative series . at the same time , the divergence of the condensate expansion in high orders will become manifest indirectly , through the occurrence of oscillating terms in @xmath13 , which appear with suppression factor @xmath25 in the case at hand . thus _ all the four _ problems formulated above will be answered !",
    "we will perform our explicit calculations for 1 + 1 qcd in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath26  the famous t  hooft model @xcite . for @xmath24",
    "only planar diagrams contribute in qcd ; 1 + 1 qcd has the additional special feature that one can choose a gauge such that there are no gluon self - interactions",
    ". then only planar ladder diagrams have to be considered , and we have an exactly solvable theory in our hands .",
    "all hadronic matrix elements of interest are therefore calculable .",
    "this enables us to describe every given transition in two complementary ways : we can confront the ope - based expression with a ",
    "phenomenological \" representation for the same process obtained by saturating the rate by exclusive hadronic channels .",
    "we want to take advantage of these unique features of the  t hooft model to illustrate all crucial elements of heavy quark theory and the theory of inclusive heavy flavor decays in particular .",
    "one should keep in mind that heavy quark theory , as we know it now , is merely an adaptation of the general ope - based approach .",
    "some of the questions to be discussed below can therefore be actually formulated in a wider setting .",
    "the t  hooft model has been exploited as a theoretical laboratory for testing various analytic qcd methods in applied problems before .",
    "heavy quark symmetry and heavy flavor decays were analyzed in refs .",
    "the model was used recently for discussing general aspects of ope ( convergence of the ope series , exponential terms violating duality , and so on )  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite heavy flavor inclusive widths were calculated numerically , by adding the exclusive channels one by one .",
    "it was found that the inclusive width @xmath13 approaches its asymptotic ( partonic ) value , and the sum over the exclusive hadronic states converges rapidly . at the same time , small deviations from the asymptotic value observed in the numerical analysis @xcite were claimed to be a signal of @xmath1 corrections in the total width , in contradiction with the ope - based result .    in this work we treat the very same problem , inclusive heavy flavor decays in 1 + 1 qcd , _ analytically_. we first develop a technique perfectly parallel to that in four - dimensional qcd @xcite .",
    "it includes such elements as a complete operator analysis and the construction of the transition operator . unlike four - dimensional qcd ,",
    "the coefficient functions for the leading operator are exactly calculable ( in the limit @xmath27 ) .",
    "moreover , all relevant expectation values of the local operators involved in the problem are calculable too .",
    "we get a complete prediction through order @xmath28 .",
    "then we carry out a  hadronic calculation \" of the same width , by saturating all open decay modes , using the t  hooft equation @xcite . by comparing the phenomenological representation of the total width with the ope - based formula , we are able to identify , term - by - term , the subsequent terms of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "the situation actually turns out to be simpler than one could expect _ a priori _ :    * in the @xmath1 expansion for the inclusive width corrections of the order @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the parton width come only from the leading operator @xmath32 , i.e. , from the expansions of its ope coefficient @xmath33 and its expectation value @xmath34 .",
    "operators of higher dimension contribute to the total width first at order @xmath35 . * the perturbative series in @xmath21 for the ope coefficient of the operator @xmath32 is completely defined by the one - loop renormalization of heavy quark mass . the result can be formulated in terms of the light - cone gauge formalism as the absence of renormalization .",
    "these results are based on a general operator analysis . on the  phenomenological \" side ,",
    "we use a sum rule , which is a consequence of the t  hooft equation , to show that the total width is determined by a quantity coinciding with the matrix element of the @xmath36 term in the ope expansion  ( [ gamma ] ) , through order @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we observe a _",
    "perfect match _ between the expression derived from the ope and from adding up all relevant hadronic channels up to high order power corrections .",
    "after testing the validity of ope , we exploit results obtained _ en route _ in order to discuss the issue of oscillating contributions related to the high - order tails in the ope series that are factorially divergent . due to the simplicity of the model we can estimate them reliably",
    ". a non - monotonous duality - violating component of the width for large @xmath9 is suppressed by high power of @xmath1 which we determined .",
    "implications of our analysis for real qcd are briefly discussed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : after formulating the problem in sec .  [",
    "sec : preliminaries ] we construct the ope and calculate the coefficients in sec .",
    "[ sec : ope ] ; after establishing the match between the ope - based result for the inclusive width and the sum rules for the same width resulting from the t  hooft equation through order @xmath31 in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : violations ] ; in the same section we discussed along similar lines a possible pattern of the violation of the local duality for @xmath37 decays in 1 + 3 dimensions ; in sec .  [ sec : nonvanishing ] we comment on the paper  @xcite and analyze effects due to nonvanishing masses of light quarks ; sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] presents a general discussion and conclusions .",
    "we start by formulating the problem and introducing our notation and conventions .    in two - dimensional qcd",
    "the lagrangian looks superficially the same as in four dimensions @xmath38 @xmath39 denote generators of @xmath40 in the fundamental representation , @xmath41 the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath42 the quark field ( @xmath43 is a flavor index ) with a mass @xmath44 ; @xmath22 the gauge coupling constant .",
    "one has to keep the following peculiarities in mind : @xmath22 carries dimension of mass as does @xmath45 .",
    "the field strength @xmath41 on the other hand has dimension @xmath46 in our normalization , just as in four - dimensional qcd . with the theory being superrenormalizable",
    "no ( infinite ) renormalization is needed ; observables like the total width @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the _ bare _ masses @xmath44 and _ bare _ coupling @xmath22 appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "anticipating the large @xmath26 limit we will use a parameter @xmath47 instead of @xmath22 where @xmath48 this dimensionful quantity @xmath47 , which  in contrast to @xmath44  provides an intrinsic mass unit for the t  hooft model , can be seen as the analog of @xmath49 of four - dimensional qcd .",
    "we need at least two quarks denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath50 with masses @xmath9 and @xmath51 , respectively , to realize heavy flavor transitions @xmath52 . for quark masses",
    "we impose @xmath53 where both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are allowed for .",
    "condition ( [ condm ] ) guarantees that the inclusive methods of ref .",
    "@xcite are applicable since it makes the energy release   that controls the reliability of the expansion in four dimensions as well .",
    "] in the weak decay large relative to the intrinsic scale @xmath47 . we will actually employ the dimensionless ratio @xmath56 as our expansion parameter .",
    "next we need to introduce a flavor - changing weak interaction ; we choose it to be of the current - current form : @xmath57 here @xmath58 is an analog of the fermi coupling constant ; it is dimensionless in two dimensions . the fields @xmath59 can be either the light quark or the lepton fields to describe nonleptonic or semileptonic decays , respectively . in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "the axial current reduces to the vector one .",
    "the most general current - current interaction contains an additional term where the vector currents are contracted via the antisymmetric @xmath60 instead of @xmath61 . for the total width  our main focus here ",
    "such an additional term is of no importance .",
    "the product of scalar densities , on the other hand , is inequivalent to that of vector densities ; we will briefly discuss it , but mainly focus on the @xmath62 interaction ( [ lweak ] ) .",
    "for @xmath24 factorization holds ; i.e. , the transition amplitude can be written as the product of matrix elements of the currents @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for the inclusive widths which are discussed below the property of factorization can be expressed as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined as @xmath68 @xmath69 this factorization follows from the fact that at @xmath70 there is no communication between @xmath71 and @xmath72 currents : any gluon exchange brings in a suppression factor @xmath73 .",
    "the only difference between the semileptonic and nonleptonic widths resides in @xmath66 , in the first case @xmath74 are leptonic fields while in the second case they are the quark fields . at @xmath75",
    "we get one and the same @xmath66 ( up to the overall normalization factor @xmath26 ) as we will show shortly . for this reason at @xmath75",
    "the distinction between the nonleptonic and semileptonic cases is actually immaterial . at @xmath76 quark and",
    "lepton polarization tensors @xmath66 become different .",
    "this difference is proportional to powers of @xmath77 .",

    "if @xmath78 is the quark field all gluon insertions inside the loop automatically vanish due to special properties of the two - dimensional @xmath81 matrices .",
    "and any odd number of @xmath81 matrices reduces to one . ] thus , at @xmath82 the only distinction between @xmath59 being quark rather than lepton fields is an overall factor @xmath26 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ piq ] ) .    a remarkable feature of eq .",
    "( [ piq ] ) is the occurrence of the pole at @xmath83 , which is specific for the vector interaction .",
    "this means that a pair of massless leptons produced by the vector current is equivalent to one massless boson , whose coupling is proportional to its momentum @xmath84 . in the case of the quark fields , it is known @xcite from the early days of the t  hooft model that the vector current @xmath85 produces from the vacuum only one massless meson , the pion .",
    "this is readily seen by inspecting the t  hooft equation @xcite .",
    "for all computational purposes the vector current @xmath86 in eq .",

    "the case of the leptonic fields @xmath59 is indistinguishable ; therefore , the coupling of @xmath88 is the same . *",
    "( ii ) * to keep the analysis to be presented below as clean and transparent as possible we want to be free of annihilation and pauli interference contributions to the total width ( at least through @xmath93 ) . this",
    "is readily achieved by assuming throughout the paper that the spectator light quark @xmath94 in @xmath2 is distinct from @xmath50 .    in the leading approximation",
    "the transition operator is determined by the diagram of fig .",

    "the expansion parameter for the coefficients is the running coupling @xmath108 ; nonperturbative contributions to the coefficients coming from distances @xmath109 could in principle show up in the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some unknown positive index , not necessarily integer . in two - dimensional qcd",

    "they come from @xmath124 which equals @xmath125 up to @xmath28 corrections .",
