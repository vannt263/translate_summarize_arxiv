    "thereafter we recall some basic results on the milnor number and the determinacy in subsections  [ subsec : milnor_number ] and  [ subsec : determinacy ] , and we also recall how these invariants can be computed . as a further prerequisite , we show that the homogeneous parts of lowest degree of two right equivalent functions factorize in the same way over @xmath5 ( section  [ subsec : factorization ] , proposition  [ kjet ] ) .",
    "we also show that in some cases , this factorization can even be carried out over @xmath9 which is important for the algorithmic aspect ( lemma  [ x^3 ] ) .    using the splitting lemma",
