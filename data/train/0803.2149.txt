    "this paper is part of a series aimed at studying the complex interplay between dynamics and stellar evolution in a sample of globular clusters ( gcs ) with different structural properties . to this purpose",
    "we are using the so - called blue stragglers star ( bss ) population as a probe .",
    "bss are the most abundant and common population of stars which significantly deviates from the evolutionary path defined by a simple , old stellar population . in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , bss define a sparsely populated sequence more luminous and bluer than the turn - off point ( to ) of a normal hydrogen - burning main - sequence ( ms ) . hence they appear as stars more massive ( see also shara et al . 1997 ) and younger than the bulk of the cluster population .",
    "they are thought to form from the evolution of binary systems , either via mass - transfer / coalescence phenomena in primordial binaries ( pb - bss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by stellar mergers induced by collisions ( col - bss ; * ? ? ?",
    "since collisional stellar systems like gcs dynamically evolve over a time - scale significantly shorter than their age , bss are expected to have sunk into the cluster core , as have the majority of the most massive objects ( like binaries and other binary by - products ) harbored in the system .    in",
    "many gcs the projected radial distribution of bsss has been found to be bimodal : highly peaked in the center , with a clear - cut dip at intermediate radii , and with an upturn in the external regions .",
    "such a behavior has been confirmed in at least 7 gcs : m3 , 47 tuc , ngc6752 , m5 , and m55 , ngc6388 ( all references in dalessandro et al .",
    "2007 ) and m53 ( beccari et al . 2008 ) . dynamical simulations ( mapelli et al .",
    "2006 ; lanzoni et al . 2007a",
    ", c ) suggest that the observed central peak is mainly due to col - bss formed in the core and/or pb - bss sunk into the center because of dynamical friction , while the external rising branch is made of pb - bss evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts . even in those gcs that do not show any bimodality the bss always appear to be significantly more segregated in the central regions than the reference cluster stars .",
    "the only exception to these general observational features is @xmath0 centauri ( hereafter @xmath0 cen ) : the large population of bss discovered by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter f06 ) in this giant stellar system has the same radial distribution of the normal cluster stars .",
    "this is a clear evidence that @xmath0 cen is not fully relaxed , even in the central regions , and therefore , the dynamical evolution of the cluster has not significantly altered the radial distribution of these stars .",
    "it is likely that the vast majority of bss observed in this cluster are the progeny of primordial binaries evolved in isolation ( see also mapelli et al .",
    "2006 ) .    here",
    "we direct our attention to another massive cluster ( ngc2419 ) which shares a number of properties with @xmath0 cen . this remote object ( @xmath1kpc ; harris et al .",
    "1997 ) is one of the most luminous clusters in the galaxy ( @xmath2 ; see bellazzini 2007 , herefater b07 ) , similar to @xmath0 cen and m54 ( ngc6715 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that both of the latter clusters are the remnants of stripped cores of dwarf spheroidals ( see , e.g. , layden & sarajedini 2000 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ) . with its high luminosity and half - light radius ( @xmath3pc ; b07 ) , ngc2419 lies ( together with @xmath0 cen and m54 ) in the @xmath4 plane well above the locus defined by all the other galactic gcs .",
    "indeed , it is the most significant outlier , thus suggesting that it also might be the stripped core of a former dwarf galaxy ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ; mackey & van den bergh 2005 ) .",
    "further , newberg et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that ngc2419 could be somehow connected with the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal , since it seems to be located in a region with an overdensity of type - a stars which is in the same plane as the tidal tails of sgr .",
    "however , the high - quality cmds of ngc2419 recently published by ripepi et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter r07 ; see also b07 ) do not show any evidence of multiple stellar populations , in contrast to @xmath0 cen ( lee et al .",
    "1999 ; pancino et al .",
    "2000 ; bedin et al .",
    "2004 ; rey et al . 2004 ; sollima et al . 2005 ) and possibly m54 ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; see also monaco et al .",
    "it is however possible that for such a metal - poor cluster ( @xmath5=-1.97 $ ] ; ferraro et al .",
    "1999b ) , the range in metallicities for the sub - population components is so small that different sequences can not be seen in the cmd ( mackey & van den bergh 2005 ; federici et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in order to further investigate the dynamical status and the stellar populations of this remote cluster",
    ", here we present a multi - wavelength study of bss in ngc2419 . by combining hst high - resolution data , with wide - field subaru images",
    ", we sampled the total radial extension of the cluster .",
    "this allowed us to study and compare the projected radial distributions of bss and other cluster stars in different evolutionary stages .",
    "the data and photometric reductions are described in   [ sec : data ] .",
    "a general overview of the cmd is discussed in   [ sec : cmd ] .",
    "the bss population is described in   [ sec : bss ] , and the discussion is presented in   [ sec : discus ] .",
    "to study the crowded cores of high - density systems and simultaneously cover the total cluster extensions , a combination of high resolution observations of the central regions and complementary wide - field images is needed .",
    "high resolution set  _ this is composed of a series of public images obtained with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hubble space telecope ( hst ) : two f435w ( @xmath6 filter ) images with @xmath7sec each , two f555w ( @xmath8 filter ) images with @xmath9sec , and two f814w ( @xmath10 filter ) images with @xmath11sec ( prop go9666 , p.i .",
    "gilliland ) .",
    "these are the highest resolution ( @xmath12 ) observations available to date for ngc2419 .",
    "unfortunately the acs images are off - centered ( see figure[acs ] ) , and they do not completely sample the most central region of the cluster . as in previous works ( see , e.g. , dalessandro et al .",
    "2007 ) , average acs images were obtained in each filter , and they were corrected for geometric distorsion and effective flux ( sirianni et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the data reduction has been performed using the romafot package ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) , specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded regions ( buonanno & iannicola 1989 ) .",
    "wide field set  _ we have used a set of public @xmath13 and @xmath14 images obtained with the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ) of the 8.2 m subaru telescope at the hawaii national astronomical observatoty of japan .",
    "the suprime - cam is a mosaic of ten @xmath15 ccds , which covers a @xmath16 field of view ( fov ) with a pixel scale of @xmath17 .",
    "a combination of long - exposures ( @xmath18sec ) and median exposure ( @xmath19sec ) images has been retrieved from the subaru archive web site ( smoka ) . as shown in figure[subaru ] , the cluster is centered in the chip # 2 and it is totally included in the five adjacent chips ; therefore only these six chips have been considered in the present study .",
    "we have applied standard pre - reduction procedures ( correction for bias , flat - field and overscan ) using iraf tools .",
    "the reduction was performed independently for each image using the psf fitting software dophot ( schechter et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the acs and subaru data have been placed on the absolute astrometric system by using the stars in common between each single chip and the sdss data set used by b07 , that , in turn , was astrometrized on the gsc - ii astrometric reference star catalog .",
    "hundreds of stars have been matched in each chip , thus allowing a very precise determination of the stellar absolute positions .",
    "the resulting rms residuals ( a measure of the internal astrometric accuracy ) were of the order of @xmath20 both in right ascension ( @xmath21 ) and declination ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the photometric calibration of the acs catalog has been performed in the vegamag stystem using the relations and zero - points described in sirianni et al .",
    "then , the subaru catalog has been homogenized to the acs one . in order to transform of the instrumental subaru magnitudes into the acs vegamag system , a subsample of a few hundred stars in common between the subaru and",
    "the acs fovs has been selected , and the following relations have been obtained : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the instrumental @xmath14 and @xmath13 magnitudes in the subaru sample referred to 1 second exposure . in this way a final list of absolute positions and homogeneous ( vegamag ) magnitudes for all the stars in the two catalogs was obtained .    in order to determine the center of gravity ( @xmath27 ) of the cluster ,",
    "we have computed the barycenter of all the stars found in the acs catalog at a distance @xmath28 from the center quoted by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "a circular region of @xmath29 radius is the maximum available area completely covered by the acs observations ( see fig.[acs ] ) .",
    "the absolute positions ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) of the stars have been averaged using an iterative technique described in previous works ( e.g. , montegriffo et al .",
    "1995 ; ferraro et al .",
    "we have excluded stars brighter than @xmath30 since they are saturated in the acs images .",
    "the same procedure has been repeated for three different magnitude cuts ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) in order to check for any possible statistical or spurious fluctuations .",
    "the three measures agree within @xmath34 and their mean value has been adopted as best estimate of @xmath35 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with an uncentainty of @xmath38 in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this new determination is in agreement with that listed by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "given the coordinates of @xmath27 , we have divided the dataset in two main samples : the _ hst sample _ , which includes all the stars found in the acs catalog , and the _ subaru sample _ , that consists of stars not included in the acs fov and lying at @xmath39 from the cluster center .",
    "the latter choice implies that a small region ( a segment of a circle located @xmath40 north from the cluster center ) is covered neither by the hst nor by the subaru sample ( see fig.[subaru ] ) .",
    "this conservative choice is made to avoid incompletness effects of the ground based observations in the most crowded central regions of the cluster . and",
    "@xmath41 from the cluster center is well sampled ( at @xmath42 ) by the acs sample . ]",
    "the cmd of stars in the hst sample is shown in figure[bbi ] .",
    "this is the deepest cmd ever published for ngc2419 , reaching down to @xmath43 .",
    "all the main cluster evolutionary sequences are clearly defined and well populated . the stars in the brightest ( @xmath44 ) portion of the red giant branch ( rgb ) are not shown in the figure , because they are heavily saturated in these exposures . the ms - to of the cluster is located at @xmath45 .",
    "particularly notable is the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology , which looks quite complex , with a long hb blue tail ( bt ) extending well below the cluster ms - to .",
    "the peak of the hb population is located at @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the hb population significantly decreases with decreasing luminosity along the bt . a poorly populated region ( a gap ? )",
    "is visible at @xmath48 , separating the extreme extention of the bt and a clump of stars extending down to @xmath49 .",
    "following the nomenclature adopted in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , these are extreme hb ( ehb ) stars with the faintest ones being blue hook ( bhk ) stars .",
    "definitive assignment to these groups will require uv photometry .    in figure[hb ]",
    "we show a direct comparison between the hb of ngc2419 , and that of @xmath0 cen ( from ferraro et al .",
    "2004 ) , suitably shifted ( by @xmath50 magnitudes ) in order to match the hb level of ngc2419 .",
    "the two hbs show very similar extension and morphology .",
    "the only significant difference is that ehb / bhk stars in ngc2419 are much more spread - out in color @xmath51 than the same population in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the rms scatter between the magnitude measurements in the two single images , is @xmath52 and @xmath53mag in the @xmath54 and @xmath14 bands , respectively .",
    "thus the photometric error in @xmath55 is @xmath56mag at the level of bhk stars .",
    "the observed color spraed is about 4@xmath57 and may thus be real . to demonstrate more clearly the striking similiarity of these hbs , in figure [ hbdistr ] we show the normalized @xmath54 magnitude distribution of hb stars .",
    "the percentage of stars in three portions of the branch is also designated in the figure . beyond general appearance ,",
    "the hbs are quantitatively similar : _ ( i ) _ both the hbs extend for almost 4.5 mag ; _ ( ii ) _ both the distributions show a well defined peak , an extended tail and a ehb / bhk clump ; _ ( iii ) _ the bulk of the hb population ( @xmath58 ) is localized in the brightest 1 magnitude portion of the branch ; _ ( iv ) _ the bt is 1012% of the population ; _ ( v ) _ both the ehb / bhk clumps extend for roughly 1.5 magnitudes and they comprise @xmath59 of the total hb population .    as discussed in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the nature of bhk stars is still unclear : they may be related to the so - called late hot flashers ( * ? ? ? * catelan 2007 ) , or due to high helium abundances ( as suggested by busso et al .",
    "2007 , in the case of ngc6388 ; see also caloi & dantona 2007 ; dantona et al .",
    "2005 ) , or related to the evolution of binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of a population of bhk stars in a low - metallicity cluster as ngc2419 clearly demonstrates that the process producing these extremely hot hb stars can efficiently work in any metallicity environment : ngc6388 ( @xmath5\\sim -0.4 $ ] ) , ngc2808 ( @xmath5\\sim -1.1 $ ] ) , @xmath0 cen ( @xmath5\\sim -1.6)$ ] , m54 ( @xmath5\\sim -1.8)$ ] and ngc2419 ( @xmath5\\sim -2 $ ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that ngc2419 is very massive as are the other bhk clusters .",
    "we have also checked the ehb / bhk radial distributions with respect to the brightest portion of the hb and the rgb .",
    "the significance of the difference has been quantified with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test : the radial distribution of the bhk population is consistent with that of normal cluster stars , in agreement with similar findings in ngc6388 ( rich et al .",
    "1997 , dalessandro et al . 2007 ) and @xmath0 cen ( ferraro et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , the evidence presented in sect.[sec : radbss ] demonstrate that ngc2419 is not relaxed even in the central regions , hence no segregation is expected for these stars even in the case they were binaries .",
    "moreover , as discussed in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , it is important to remember that the lack of segregation of the ehb / bhk population is not a firm proof of the non - binarity of ehb / bhk stars , since they could be low - mass binaries , with a total mass similar ( or even lower ) than `` normal '' cluster stars ( for example , a 0.5@xmath60 he - burning star with a 0.2@xmath60 he white dwarf companion ) .",
    "the @xmath61 ) cmds of the hst and subaru samples defined in section 2.2 are shown in figure[vvi ] .",
    "thanks to the high - resolution acs images of the cluster core and the wide fov of the subaru observations , we have properly sampled the stellar population over the entire cluster extension .",
    "we have then used this data - set to determine the projected density profile of ngc2419 using direct star counts , from @xmath27 out to about @xmath62 .",
    "stars with @xmath63 are saturated in the acs sample and therefore have been excluded from the analysis ; however , since they are small in number , this produces a negligible effect on the global result . in order to avoid incompleteness biases",
    "we have also excluded stars fainter than @xmath64 . using the same procedure described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999a ) the whole sample has been divided in 24 concentric annuli , each centered on @xmath27 and suitably split in a number of subsectors .",
    "the number counts have been calculated in each subsector and the corresponding densities were obtained dividing them by the sampled area ( taking into account the incomplete spatial coverage of the region between @xmath65 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the stellar density of each annulus has then be defined as the average of the subsector densities and its standard deviation is computed from the variance among the subsectors .",
    "the resulting projected surface density profile is plotted in figure[king ] . as apparent ,",
    "the outermost two points show a flattening of the stellar number density , and their average ( corresponding to @xmath66stars / arcmin@xmath67 ) has therefore been used as an estimate of the background contribution .",
    "the derived radial density profile is well fit by an isotropic single - mass king model ( solid line in fig.[king ] ) , with concentration @xmath68 and core radius @xmath69 , yielding a `` formal '' value of the cluster tidal radius of @xmath70 and a half - mass radius of @xmath71 .",
    "these parameters are essentially equal to those obtained by b07 and in good agreement with other previous determinations ( see , e.g. , table 2 in b07 ) .",
    "we have used the available high - quality data set also for deriving an independent estimate of the distance to ngc2419 . to do this , we compared the cmd shown in fig.[bbi ] , to that of m92 ( ngc6341 ) , one of the `` prototype '' galactic gcs , with similar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath72 , ferraro et al .",
    "we have used a combination of wfpc2 and acs data of m92 ( f.r .",
    "ferraro et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) , obtained through filters f555w ( @xmath8 ) and f814w ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we have shifted the cmd of m92 onto that of ngc2419 until a good match between the main evolutionary sequences ( rgb , hb , sub - giant branch and to region ) of the two clusters was reached ( see figure[m92 ] ) .",
    "this has required a color shift @xmath73 and @xmath74 , similar to that obtained by harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from an analogous comparison based on independent data sets .",
    "figure[m92 ] shows that a really nice matching of all the evolutionary sequences of the two clusters can be achieved .",
    "this evidence also suggests that the two clusters have a similar age ( in agreement with harris et al .",
    "1997 , who estimated an age difference of @xmath75gyr for the two objects ) .    by assuming the distance modulus @xmath76 and the reddening @xmath77 for m92 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999b ) , and by using the standard absorption coefficient ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , we have obtained @xmath80 and @xmath81 , corresponding to a true distance modulus @xmath82 , for ngc2419 .",
    "the reddening obtained from this procedure is in good agreement with the value derived by harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who quoted @xmath83 , and it is also agreement with the value @xmath84 adopted by r07 within the errors . taking a conservative estimate of @xmath85mag",
    ", we finally adopt @xmath86 .",
    "this yields a real distance @xmath87kpc . within the uncertanties ,",
    "this estimate is in agreement with both that found by harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ; @xmath88kpc ) and that obtained by r07 using the mean luminosity of the rr lyrae stars ( @xmath89kpc ) . assuming this distance , the physical dimension of the core radius and of the half - mass radius of the cluster can be obtained : given @xmath69 and @xmath90 ( see above ) , we obtain @xmath91pc and @xmath92pc , respectively . by adopting the total integrated magnitude @xmath93 quoted by b07 , the absolute cluster magnitude is @xmath94 .",
    "this value , combined with the size of the the half - mass radius , confirms the anomalous position of ngc2419 in the @xmath95 versus @xmath96 plane ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ) .",
    "to select the bss population we have chosen to use the ( @xmath97 ) cmd , in which the bss sequence is better defined . to avoid spurious effects due to sub - giant branch star blends and galaxy field star contamination , only stars brighter than @xmath98 ( corresponding to @xmath99 1 mag above the to ) and with @xmath100",
    "have been selected ( see figure[bbisel ] ) .",
    "the resulting number of candidate bss in the _ hst sample _ is 183 .",
    "the position of the bulk of these stars in the acs ( @xmath101 ) cmd has then been used to define the bss selection box for the _ subaru sample_. this is shown in figure[vvisel ] , with the faint and red edges corresponding to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the resulting number of candidate bss found in the entire subaru sample is 67 , out of which 49 are found within the `` safe '' distance of @xmath104 from the cluster center .",
    "this distance is sligthly larger than the `` formal '' tidal radius obtained in sect.[sec : kingdist ] and takes into account possible uncertanties in the determination of the latter .",
    "the positions and magnitudes of the all the 232 candidate bss thus selected are listed in table 1 , which is available in full size in electronic form .",
    "reference populations representative of the `` normal '' cluster stars are needed to properly study the bss radial distribution .",
    "we considered both the hb and the rgb . since the hst and the subaru samples have the @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters in common",
    ", we performed a homogeneous selection of these populations in the @xmath105 plane .",
    "the hb selection box ( see fig.[vvisel ] ) has been drawn to limit the contribution of field contamination in the bright - red portion of the sequence ( i.e. , we have required that @xmath106 at @xmath107 ) and in order to exclude the ehb / bhk clump ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the ehb / bhk stars populate a region located @xmath75 magnitude below the ms - to ( see fig.[m92 ] ) , which is very close to the detection limit of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 observations .",
    "thus , they could be severely affected by incompletness bias , and we have therefore preferred not to include them in the hb reference population . however , since their radial distribution is indistinguishable from that of the other hb stars , this exclusion has negligible effect on the following results .",
    "the total number of hb stars thus selected within @xmath109 is 765 , with 528 found in the hst sample and 237 in the subaru one .",
    "the rgb population has been selected along the rgb mean ridge line between @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( see the selection box in fig.[vvisel ] ) .",
    "this choice has been dictated by the fact that the brightest portion of the rgb sequence is saturated in the hst sample , and its faintest portion is contaminated by galactic field stars , especially in the subaru sample .",
    "the total number of these stars within @xmath109 is 3250 , with 2337 found in the hst sample and 913 in the subaru one .      a first qualitative comparison between the cumulative radial distribution of bss and that of the reference populations ( see figure[ks ] ) has been performed using the ks test .",
    "this gives 70% and 50% probabilities that the bss population is extracted from the same population as the hb and rgb stars , respectively .",
    "hence there is preliminary evidence that the radial distribution of bss is indistinguishable from that of the `` normal '' cluster population , in contrast to what found in most of the typical gcs ( see references in dalessandro et al .",
    "2007 ) .    for a more detailed analysis",
    ", we have used the same technique described in previous works ( see , e.g. , f06 ) .",
    "the sampled area within @xmath112 has been divided in 5 concentric annuli centered on @xmath27 . in each of these",
    "we have counted the number of bss , hb and rgb stars .",
    "however , the examination of the external regions ( @xmath113 ) of the subaru sample cmd suggests that the selected ( bss , hb , and rgb ) populations can be affected by contamination from stars in the galactic field . in order to account for this effect we adopted the statistical correction as used in previous papers ( see , e.g. , dalessandro et al .",
    "2007 ) . to do this",
    "we selected a rectangular region of @xmath114 located at @xmath115 , i.e. well beyond the formal tidal radius of the cluster .",
    "the cmd of this region clearly shows that the galaxy field population is dominant relative to the cluster one .",
    "then we counted the number of stars in this region lying in the bss , hb and rgb selection boxes showed in fig.[vvi ] and derived the following values of the field star densities : @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "these quantities allow us to estimate the impact of the field contamination on the selected samples : 6 bss ( @xmath119 ) , 12 hb ( @xmath120 ) and 31 rgb(@xmath121 ) , essentially all in the most external annulus , could be field stars ( see table[tab : counts ] ) . though the effect of the field contamination is small , in the following we use the statistically decontaminated samples in order to determine the population ratios and the radial distribution .    by using the king model , the distance modulus and the reddening estimated in sect.[sec : kingdist ] ,",
    "the luminosity sampled in each annulus ( @xmath122 ) has also been estimated .",
    "then for each annulus we have computed the double normalized ratio defined in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath123 with pop= bss , hb and rgb .",
    "we find that @xmath124 and @xmath125 are essentially constant and close to unity ( see @xmath124 in figure[rpop ] ) .",
    "this is what expected for any post - ms population according to the stellar evolution theory ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) .",
    "surprisingly we also find that the double normalized ratio of bss is constant , and it is fully consistent with the reference populations ( fig.[rpop ] ) .",
    "using the number counts listed in table[tab : counts ] , we have also computed the specific frequencies @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we find that all these ratios are almost costant all over the entire extension of the cluster ( see figure[npop ] ) , confirming again that no signatures of mass segregation are visible for the bss population of ngc2419 .",
    "in most previously surveyed galactic gcs ( m3 ; 47 tuc , ngc6752,m5 , m55 , ngc6388 , m53 ) the bss radial distribution has been found to be bimodal ( higly peaked in the core , decreasing to a minimun at intermediate radii , and rising again in the external regions ) .",
    "the mechanisms leading to bimodal radial distributions have been studied for some clusters using dynamical simulations ( see mapelli et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; lanzoni et al . 2007a ,",
    "c ) : the observed central peak is mainly made up of collisionally formed bss and/or pb - bss sunk into the core because of dynamical friction ; the external rising branch is composed of pb - bss evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts .",
    "in contrast , the bss radial distribution of ngc2419 is essentially the same as that of the other `` normal '' stars in the cluster .",
    "previously , @xmath0 cen was the only gc known to have a flat bss radial distribution .",
    "f06 ( see also meylan & heggie 1997 ) argued that two - body relaxation had not led to the complete relaxation of @xmath0 cen even in the central core .",
    "our result here suggests that the same situation holds for ngc2419 .",
    "we can compare this observational evidence with theoretical time - scales expected on the basis of the cluster structural parameters .",
    "following equation ( 10 ) of djorgovski ( 1993 ) , we computed the cluster central relaxation time ( @xmath129 ) by adopting @xmath130 for the average stellar mass , and @xmath131 for the mass - to - light ratio and @xmath132 for the @xmath13 band solar magnitude",
    ". the integrated magnitude obtained in sect.[sec : kingdist ] then leads to a total cluster mass of @xmath133 , and a total number of stars of @xmath134 . by assuming @xmath135 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , and given the value of the core radius ( @xmath91pc ) derived in sect.[sec : kingdist ] , we obtain @xmath136gyr , which is about half the cluster age ( @xmath13713 gyr ; harris et al .",
    "thus some evidence of mass segregation should be visible at least in the core , at odds with the observed flat distribution of bss .",
    "we can also compute the characteristic relaxation time - scale for stars as massive as bss ( @xmath138 ; see f06 ) at the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath95 ) using equation ( 10 ) of davies et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . since @xmath139pc ( see sect.[sec : kingdist ] ) we obtain @xmath140gyr , thus suggesting that no significant segregation is expected for stars as massive as the bss in the outer parts of the clusters , in agreement with our observational results .",
    "this result is similar to that found for @xmath0 cen by f06 where the relaxation time in the core was found to be @xmath99 half the cluster age . in the case of @xmath0 cen a number of possible explanations were examined ; for instance , the possibility that @xmath0 cen is the relic of a partially disrupted galaxy , which was much more massive in the past .",
    "a similar argument can be advocated for ngc2419 , which has also been suspected to be the relic of a small dwarf galaxy interacting with the milky way ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ; federici et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the above estimates of the relaxation times are rough , and since the predicted value of @xmath129 is only a factor of 2 smaller than the cluster age , more detailed computations are needed before further interpret these results .    from the observational side ,",
    "the bss radial distribution shown in figs.[rpop ] and [ npop ] suggests that in ngc2419 ( as in @xmath0 cen ) stellar collisions have played a minor ( if any ) role in modifying the radial distribution of massive objects and probably also in generating exotic binary systems .",
    "if dynamical evolution plays a central role in ngc2419 , the observed flat bss distribution can be explained only by invoking an _ ad hoc _ formation / destruction rate balancing the bss population in the core and in the outer region of the cluster .",
    "it is more likely that this flat distribution arises because the bss we are observing result from the evolution of primordial binaries whose radial distribution has not been altered by the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "thus , as in the case of @xmath0 cen , the bss population observed in ngc2419 could be a pure population of pb - bss , and it can be used to evaluate the incidence of such a population in stellar systems .",
    "as in previous papers ( see e.g. ferraro et al .",
    "1995 , f06 ) here we compute the pb - bss frequency as the number of bss normalized to the sampled luminosity in units of @xmath141 : @xmath142 ( see the bottom panel of fig.[npop ] ) .",
    "this quantity is useful for estimating the expected number of bss generated by pbs for each fraction of the sampled light in any stellar system , resolved or not . for ngc2419 , we find @xmath143 ( see fig.[npop ] ) . before comparing this quantity to that found in @xmath0 cen by f06",
    ", we must account for the fact that the adopted bss selection criteria are different in the two clusters . in ngc2419 we considered bss brighter than @xmath144",
    "; this threshold corresponds to @xmath145 at the distance of @xmath0 cen , using the value @xmath146 needed to shift the hb of @xmath0 cen onto that of ngc2419 ( see fig.[hbdistr ] ) . by adopting this threshold , 104 bss",
    "are found in the acs fov of @xmath0 cen , and by considering the sampled luminosity , we obtain @xmath147 for this cluster . ) obtained in f06 by considering the entire sample of bss with @xmath148 this comparison suggests that the number of bss per unit sampled light in ngc2419 is twice as large than that in @xmath0 cen .",
    "cen , i.e. @xmath149 ( which corresponds to @xmath150 at the distance of ngc2419 ) .",
    "] under the hypothesis that the vast majority of these bss are generated by the evolution of pbs , the different @xmath151 values could result from a different binary frequency in the two clusters , since pb - bss are expected to strongly depend on the fraction of binaries in the cluster .",
    "indeed the first direct correlation between these two quantities ( the binary fraction and the bss frequency ) has been recently detected in a sample of 13 low - density clusters by sollima et al .",
    "such a connection strongly supports a scenario in which the evolution of pbs is the main formation channel for bss in low - density environments .",
    "the case of ngc2419 further supports the idea that important signatures of the dynamical evolution of the parent cluster are imprinted in the radial distribution of the bss population : indeed the most recent results collected by our group ( see ferraro et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; lanzoni et al . 2007a ,",

    "<S> the bss radial distribution is similar to that of @xmath0 centauri and unlike that of all galactic globular clusters studied to date , which have highly centrally segregated distributions and , in most cases , a pronounced upturn in the external regions . as in the case of @xmath0 centauri </S>",
    "<S> , this evidence indicates that ngc2419 is not yet relaxed even in the central regions . </S>",
    "<S> this observational fact is in agreement with estimated half - mass relaxation time , which is of the order of the cluster age . </S>"
