    "in this talk i discuss two apparently distinct but deeply entwined topics .",
    "first , i ask for what quark masses is cp spontaneously broken .",
    "second , i investigate whether a vanishing up quark mass is a physically meaningful concept .",
    "i should emphasize at the outset that i will be exploring rather unphysical regions of parameter space .",
    "this in some sense is a theorists fantasy , with no direct experimental relevance .",
    "indeed , my real goal is to understand better how chiral symmetry works in the strong interactions .",
    "the main content of this talk is contained in two recent papers @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas have roots in a talk i gave in como at the 1996 edition of this conference @xcite .",
    "i require a few assumptions .",
    "first , the continuum limit of qcd should exist and confine , with the only relevant parameters being the coupling and the quark masses .",
    "then i will assume that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the usual way and that effective chiral lagrangians are qualitatively correct .",
    "finally i assume that the anomaly removes any flavor singlet chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular , this implies that a single massless quark gives no exact goldstone boson .",
    "the underlying concepts are all quite old . in 1971",
    "dashen @xcite showed how cp symmetry could be spontaneously broken in the strong interactions .",
    "divecchia and veneziano @xcite observed the cp violation in chiral lagrangians at negative quark masses .",
    "georgi and mcarthur @xcite showed that non - perturbative effects could give a non - multiplicative shift to the up quark mass .",
    "this motivated kaplan and manohar @xcite in their classic studies of ambiguities in the up quark mass in the context of effective chiral lagrangians .",
    "banks , nir and seiberg @xcite discussed the fact that the concept of a vanishing up quark mass is not so clean .",
    "i base my initial discussion on the effective theory for pseudoscalar mesons in terms of a field taking values in the group @xmath0 @xmath1 i work with the three flavor theory , i.e. i include the up , down , and strange quarks .",
    "the standard generators of the group su(3 ) are given by @xmath2 , and the pseudoscalar octet fields are denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "chiral symmetry is manifested in independent left or right global rotations on this field @xmath4 this symmetry is explicitly broken by the quark masses . the lowest order",
    "effective lagrangian including the masses takes the form @xmath5 with the mass matrix @xmath6 expanding this density to quadratic order in meson fields and then diagonalizing the resulting non - derivative term gives the usual result that the meson masses squared are proportional to the quark masses , including @xmath7 for my purposes , i am particularly interested in the isospin violation arising from the up - down mass difference @xmath8 .",
    "this results in a mixing of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons , giving somewhat complicated formulae for their masses @xmath11 note in particular that it is possible to tune the parameters such that @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "this occurs when @xmath13 this vanishing mass does not require chiral symmetry .",
    "it does , however , occur at a somewhat unphysical location , requiring at least one of the quark masses to be negative .",
    "going to negative quark masses at first seems a bit strange , but in such a regime unusual things do happen .",
    "note that because of the anomaly , the signs of the quark masses can become significant .",
    "flavored chiral rotations can move the signs around , but the overall sign of the determinant of the mass matrix is invariant .",
    "the effective lagrangian is useful for clarifying the expected behavior with negative masses . in the usual case with positive masses ,",
    "the vacuum involves quantum fluctuations about the maximum of @xmath14 .",
    "this occurs at @xmath15 .",
    "however , now consider the case of degenerate negative masses .",
    "the vacuum instead should occur at the minimum of @xmath16 .",
    "the important point is that @xmath17 does not lie in the group @xmath0 .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the minimum is doubly degenerate , occuring at @xmath18 .",
    "[ su3 ] plots the traces of 10,000 random matrices to illustrate this result .",
    "note that cp symmetry takes @xmath19 to @xmath20 ; thus , either of these solutions involves a spontaneous breaking of cp .     matrices .",
    "note that the minimum real part occurs at two distinct cube roots of unity . ]    .",
    "this cp violating phase can be approached continuously by passing through the values of the quark masses in eq .",
    "[ boundary ] where @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "indeed , this equation represents the boundary for the occurance of a pion condensed phase with @xmath22 .",
    "similar boundaries occur at the appropriate branches of @xmath23 the full phase diagram is sketched in fig .",
    "[ cpr1 ] .        in the cp",
    "violating phases the vacuum fluctuates about non - trivial complex matrices of form @xmath24 where the angles satisfy @xmath25 the cp violating phases are separated from the conserving ones by second order transition lines occuring when @xmath26 .",
    "the former have two degenerate vacua related by @xmath27 .",
    "i now take a section through this diagram .",
    "phenomenologically , the down and strange quark masses appear to definitely not vanish .",
    "consider fixing them at some positive values and study the dependence of the theory as a function of the up quark mass alone .",
    "thus follow a horizontal line at fixed @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ cpr1 ] . to enable continuation around the boundary of the cp violating phase , extend the @xmath29 dependence into the complex plane .",
    "this gives the qualitative structure sketched in fig .",
    "[ oneflavor ] .",
    "the expectation is a first order transition along negative @xmath30 axis .",
    "this ends at a second order critical point at non - zero @xmath31 . along the first order line",
    "there is a spontaneous breaking of cp .",
    "the transition has a simple order parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of the gap below @xmath33 and the cp violating phase were noted some time ago by di vecchia and veneziano @xcite .    note",
    "that nothing significant occurs at @xmath33 when @xmath34 .",
    "this raises an interesting question : does @xmath33 have any physical significance ?",
    "i now argue that this is not a well posed question if @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "one consequence of this observation is that a vanishing up quark mass is an unacceptable solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "a crucial message here is that the concept of an `` underlying basic lagrangian '' does not exist .",
    "field theory is full of divergences that must be regulated .",
    "it is only the underlying symmetries of the theory that remain significant .",
    "the case of a single massless quark gives no special symmetry because of the anomaly . unlike the multiple degenerate quark case",
    ", no exact goldstone bosons should appear at @xmath33 .",
    "a continuum field theory is defined as a limit of a cutoff theory .",
    "for qcd the bare parameters are the coupling @xmath36 and quark masses @xmath37 .",
    "these must be renormalized for the continuum limit ; indeed both bare parameters renormalize to zero in a well defined way given by the renormalization group equations . for this discussion",
    "i denote the cutoff as a minimum length @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the inverse of a large momentum scale . to simplify the discussion",
    "i will consider a single quark mass .",
    "then the well known flow equations in the small coupling limit take the form @xmath39 the first few coefficients @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are scheme independent . in these equations",
    "the `` non - perturbative '' parts fall faster than any power of @xmath36 as @xmath42 .",
    "q crucial point , to which i will return , is that these contributions are not proportional to the quark mass .",
    "the solution to these equations is standard @xmath43 rewriting shows how the coupling and mass go to zero in the continuum limit @xmath44 @xmath45 the first part of this equation represents the famous phenomenon of `` asymptotic freedom . ''    at a basic level these equations arise from holding a few physical quantities fixed along the `` renormalization group trajectory , '' as sketched in fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] . for this discussion",
    "it is convenient to use the lightest baryon and the lightest meson masses , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , as physical quantities to hold fixed . with multiple quark flavors one would hold",
    "several meson masses fixed .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent `` integration constants '' of the renormalization group equations .",
    "@xmath48 is conventionally interpreted as the `` qcd scale , '' while @xmath49 defines a the `` renormalized quark mass . ''",
    "their values follow from limits along the renormalization group trajectory @xmath50 @xmath51 the precise numerical values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend on the renormalization scheme .    the physical masses map directly onto the integration constants , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "inverting , gives the physical masses as functions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "simple dimensional analysis implies this relationship must take the form @xmath56 , with @xmath57 some _ a priori _ unknown function .    in the case of multiple",
    "degenerate fermions more is known about the behavior of @xmath58 . in particular , goldstone bosons should appear as the quark mass goes to zero : @xmath59 .",
    "this implies the existence of a square root singularity @xmath60 .",
    "the location of this singularity defines what is meant by zero mass quarks , thus removing any additive ambiguity in defining @xmath49 .    the single massless flavor case , however , is somewhat special",
    ". then the meson mass @xmath61 does not vanish at @xmath62 .",
    "the anomaly precludes chiral symmetry and goldstone bosons .",
    "while the meson mass can be forced to vanish , the earlier discussion shows that this requires a special tuning to a negative quark mass . for the function @xmath63 one expects a smooth and non - vanishing behavior at @xmath64 .",
    "the shift of the singularity in @xmath65 away from zero is due to non - perturbative effects .",
    "indeed , non - perturbative contributions to the mass flow are expected which are not proportional to quark mass . as shown some time ago by thooft @xcite , there are nonperturbative classical effects called `` instantons '' that flip all quark spins simultaneously . tying the heavier quarks together with their mass terms as sketched in fig .",
    "[ thooft ] gives rise to a contribution to the up quark mass flow @xmath66 these effects indicate that @xmath33 is not renormalization group invariant .",
    "if the up quark mass vanishes as some point on the trajectory , it will not for other points .",
    "this non - invariance of the quark mass under the renormalization group raises the specter of scheme dependence .",
    "on changing renormalization schemes one should preserve the lowest order perturbative limit as @xmath42 at fixed scale @xmath38 @xmath67 here `` non - perturbative '' terms should vanish faster than any power of @xmath36 . as mentioned above , the integration constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 in general depend on the chosen scheme .",
    "it is important to recognize that this perturbative matching at fixed @xmath38 is not the continuum limit . indeed , taking @xmath42 at fixed @xmath38 gives perturbation theory on free quarks , while taking @xmath44 at fixed @xmath36 gives the divergences of field theory .",
    "for the confining physics of the real world , one must go between these limits and take @xmath38 and @xmath36 together to zero along the renormalization group trajectory .    to dramatically illustrate the issue , consider a particularly cooked up new scheme @xmath68 here i have crafted the last factor in the mass expression to approach unity .",
    "this non - perturbative redefinition of the bare parameters makes @xmath69 while this may be somewhat artificial , it shows that some scheme always exists where the renormalized quark mass vanishes .",
    "of course doing this for the top quark will insert ridiculously large non - perturbative effects , but it is possible in principle .",
    "because of this ambiguity , @xmath62 is scheme dependent and thus is not a physical concept .",
    "of course with degenerate quarks one can precisely define masslessness by the location of the square root singularity in @xmath57 as defined above .      as in the general case , on the lattice the renormalization flows depend on details of the lattice action .",
    "various gauge actions as well as the fermion formulation need to be considered .",
    "recent discussions have concentrated on overlap / ginsparg - wilson fermion operators @xcite , which bring a remnant of chiral symmetry to the lattice .",
    "however even these operators are not unique .",
    "the overlap operator relies on a projection , but it depends on the particular dirac operator being projected .",
    "when starting with a wilson dirac operator , the input negative mass is adjustable over a finite range .",
    "the one flavor theory dynamically generates a gap which will appear in the spectrum of the final dirac operator .",
    "the overlap projection does not protect the size of this gap .",
    "with the gap present , the ginsparg - wilson condition is not sufficient to guarantee the preservation of @xmath62 between schemes .    with a ginsparg - wilson action the concept of a massless quark is synonymous with zero topological susceptibility .",
    "if a single massless quark is an ill defined concept , this raises the question of whether the topological susceptibility is uniquely defined for @xmath70 .",
    "this question has also been asked in the context of making the witten - veneziano formula @xcite for the @xmath71 mass precise @xcite . from a perturbative point of view infinities",
    "are not a problem @xcite .",
    "however , to give a unique winding number to a gauge configuration requires a degree of smoothness for the gauge fields .",
    "one popular condition that ensures a well defined winding number forbids plaquettes further than a finite distance @xmath72 from the identity @xcite .",
    "however this condition is rather strong and leaves unresolved issues .",
    "in particular this `` admissibility condition '' has recently been shown to be in conflict with reflection positivity @xcite .",
    "effective chiral lagrangians show that the strong interactions will spontaneously violate cp for large regions of parameter space .",
    "this phenomenon requires negative quark masses , a concept made physical by the anomaly .",
    "based on this qualitative picture , i have argued that @xmath33 is not a meaningful concept . as such",
    ", it can not be regarded as a possible solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "these effects are entirely non - perturbative . as a corollary ,",
    "the topological susceptibility is not uniquely defined for @xmath70 .",
    "finally , i note that available simulation algorithms can not explore this fascinating physics because it involves regions where the fermion determinant is not positive , i.e. monte carlo methods have a sign problem .",
