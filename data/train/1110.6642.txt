    "one of the most unexpected new feature of the lhc data has been the very different power - law energy behavior of the charged hadron multiplicities in aa compared to pp collisions @xcite .",
    "there have been several approaches to address the above problem @xcite .",
    "this is closely related to the open problem of entropy production at the early stage of heavy - ion collisions ( mini bangs ) .    in the following ,",
    "we provide a simple explanation of this observation and confront our published predictions @xcite with the recently released data from the lhc @xcite for the rapidity distribution of the charged hadron production .",
    "in the color glass condensate ( cgc)/saturation based approaches ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the hadron production may be divided in two stages : production of gluons and subsequently the decay of gluon - jet ( or mini - jet ) into hadrons .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity of the produced hadrons at pseudo - rapidity @xmath1 can be calculated as a convolution of these two stages ( see ): [ i1 ] & & n^gluon_h ( e_jet ) , + & & _ s q^2_s n^gluon_h(q_s ) , [ i11]where @xmath2 gives the gluon jet production yield at rapidity @xmath3 ( in pp or aa collisions ) computable in the @xmath4 factorization scheme @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath5 is the average multiplicity of hadrons in the gluon jet with a jet energy @xmath6 computable in the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 indicates a convolution , that is , integrals over variables with possible weight factors included @xcite .",
    "the greatest simplicity of the cgc approach is the fact that all complexity of infinite - body problem at very high energy ( or small @xmath9 ) shall be reduced into a one scale problem , with a hard saturation scale @xmath10 as the only dimensional relevant scale at which nonlinear gluons recombination effects start to become important . in this framework , the secondary hadrons are originated from the decay of gluon mini - jets with the transverse momentum equal to the saturation scale @xmath10 @xcite . then up to a possible logarithmic correction , can be readily obtained by a dimensionality argument where @xmath11 is the effective area of interaction .",
    "notice that the @xmath4 factorization has been proven at the leading @xmath12 approximation for scatterings of a dilute system on a dense one ( such as proton - nucleus collisions ) and includes bfkl type gluon emissions ( with gluon fusion effects ) between the projectile and target , and also gluon radiations from the produced gluons @xcite .",
    "however , the other contribution of the gluon decay , before hadronization , stems from the kinematic region outside the bfkl emission regime where both emitted gluons are collinear to the emitter @xcite . in this kinematic region ,",
    "the angle between the gluon ( quark ) and the decay gluon is small and the main contribution of gluon - decay has an opposite angular ordering to the bfkl type gluon emissions .",
    "the later kinematic region has been traditionally studied within a different resummation scheme , the so - called mlla where it contains systematically next - to - leading logarithmic corrections and incorporates single and double - logarithmic effects in the development of parton cascades @xcite .",
    "notice that the gluon decay effect incorporated within these two resummation schemes have different kinematics @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the gluon decay probability can be factorized from the rest of cross - section in @xmath14 reaction @xcite .",
    "this is in a sense , the essence of the factorization given in .",
    "one may extract information about the gluon - decay stage in the mlla region from gluon jet data in @xmath0 collisions . in order to obtain the energy dependence of the function @xmath5",
    ", we use directly experimental data for @xmath15 in @xmath16 annihilation @xcite .",
    "one can see from that @xmath17 is constant at about @xmath18 gev and it grows as a power of @xmath6 at higher energies . from the available @xmath0 collisions data shown in",
    ", we found that the energy - dependence of the mean charged particle multiplicity of gluon - jet can be approximately described by [ eee ] n^gluon_he^_jet ,  = 0.60.7   e_jet0.85 1   .",
    "it is essential to stress again that such behavior also follows from the theoretical estimates in the 3nlo pqcd in the mlla scheme @xcite .",
    "now , using eqs .",
    "( [ i11],[eee ] ) and assuming the typical energy of the gluon jet to be of the order of average saturation scale , we obtain ,      ( p p ) & & q^2_ss^/2 = s^0.11 , [ n21 ] + ( a a ) & & q^2_s ( e_jetq_s)^0.65 s^/2 + 0.65/4=s^0.145,[n22 ] where @xmath19 is the center - of - mass energy squared per nucleon pair and @xmath20 is free parameter to be fixed with other experiments like dis at hera . in the above we assumed that the saturation scale for pp collisions is @xmath21 gev and for aa collisions we have @xmath22 gev .",
    "we take for the parameter @xmath23 , the average value @xmath24 from . in",
    ", the average value of @xmath25 in the the effective saturation scale for pp collisions can be obtained from @xmath4 factorization results given in ref .",
    "then , the power - law behavior given in for aa collisions comes naturally without any extra freedom . the simple eqs .",
    "( [ n21],[n22 ] ) are enough to describe energy - dependence of all existing data on hadron multiplicity from rhic to the lhc , see ( right ) . indeed the full calculation @xcite ( shown by orange line in ) based on the factorization shown in , agrees with the above argument based on the dimensionality .",
    "it is seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eee],[n22 ] ) that the @xmath4 factorization accounts for the most energy - dependence of the hadron multiplicity @xmath26 , while the mlla gluon - decay cascade ( extracted from @xmath0 annihilation data ) brings only about @xmath27 extra effect .",
    "notice that in the above we assumed that the atomic number or @xmath28 ( size of nuclei ) dependence of the saturation scale is factorizable from energy .",
    "this assumption can be simply justified from the observation that the centrality dependence of the multiplicity at the lhc is very similar to rhic up to an overall scale , see .",
    "this means that the energy and centrality or @xmath28 dependence of multiplicity ( and saturation scale ) can be scaled out , in agreement with our assumption .",
    "therefore , data seems to role out any extra energy dependence to be generated due to the geometry and the centrality of collisions . in",
    ", we compare our published prediction @xcite for the rapidity distribution of charged hadrons coming from the full calculation with the recent cms data @xcite .",
    "it is seen in that our predictions is in excellent agreement with data .",
    "our prediction for @xmath29 at midrapidity for @xmath30 pb+pb collisions at @xmath31 tev is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we also show in our prediction for the rapidity distribution of charged hadrons multiplicity for pb+pb collisions at @xmath31 tev @xcite .     at various centralities at rhic .",
    "the data was constructed from three experimental measurements , the average transverse momentum @xmath33 of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite . left : average transverse momenta as a function of @xmath37 at rhic .",
    "the experimental data are from @xcite . ]    in ( right ) , we show @xmath38 at midrapidity ( where @xmath39 is the number of participant for a given centrality ) has the scaling property at different energies .",
    "notice that one can already observe similar scaling property at rhic , namely @xmath29 at fixed energy but different centralities falls into a single curve upto a normalization factor , see ( left ) .",
    "both scaling properties shown in can be easily understood within the cgc picture and follows from simple .",
    "we expect that the centrality - scaling for @xmath29 at a fixed energy will be also valid at the lhc .",
    "we predict that @xmath38 for @xmath31 tev aa collisions at midrapidity to be about @xmath40 times bigger than the corresponding one at @xmath41 tev .",
    "in ( right ) we show the experimental data from the star collaboration @xcite for @xmath42 as a function of centrality where @xmath33 is the average transverse momentum and @xmath36 is the overlap area between the colliding nuclei in the transverse plane . in our approach , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 for @xmath45 gev corresponding to the excess of charged hadron production in the presence of jet - decay effects .",
    "it is seen from that the ratio @xmath46 at rhic au+au collisions decreases for more central collisions and higher energies in accordance with our model and in contrast to the kln type approach @xcite .",
    "we expect that the ratio @xmath46 will be further suppressed at the lhc compared to rhic , see .",
    "moreover , in the kln type approaches @xcite we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 while in our approach we have @xmath49 for the case that the saturation scale is @xmath50 gev . in ( left )",
    "we show the average transverse momenta as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the star collaboration @xcite has found that the experimental data for the charged pion at different centralities can be described by @xmath52 where the constant @xmath53 gev was obtained from a fit and may be interpreted as primordial transverse momentum . in , we also show that a fit driven by our approach prefers a smaller primordial transverse momentum of about pion mass @xmath54 ( or even @xmath55 ) and it reasonably describes the same data .",
    "notice that at small multiplicity for very peripheral collisions at rhic energy entire saturation formulation is questionable .    to conclude : we extracted the energy - dependence of the gluon - jet decay cascade from @xmath0 annihilation data .",
    "we showed that the energy - dependence of about @xmath27 due to the gluon - decay cascade ( when the average transverse momentum of the jet becomes about or bigger than @xmath56 gev ) is exactly what explains the different power - law energy - dependence of hadron multiplicity in aa compared to pp collisions at the lhc .",
    "this effect is more important for aa collisions where the saturation scale is larger and gives rise to an extra contribution about @xmath57 to the multiplicity in aa collisions at the lhc . on the theory side",
    ", this emphasizes on the importance of higher order corrections beyond the leading log approximation in the @xmath4 factorization , and on general , this also gives rise to the outstanding problem that how the fragmentation processes can be accommodated within the cgc / saturation framework .",
