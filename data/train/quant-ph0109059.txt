    "de broglie first proposed a particle - trajectory interpretation of the klein - gordon equation in the period 1926 - 1927@xcite .",
    "he proceeded using the polar form of the scalar field , @xmath0 to decompose the wave equation ( with @xmath1 ) @xmath2 into a continuity equation @xmath3 and a `` hamilton - jacobi '' equation @xmath4 thus casting the theory in the form of a `` classical - particle '' theory with canonical four - momentum @xmath5 and an additional `` quantum potential '' term @xmath6 which de broglie interpreted in terms of a variable rest mass @xmath7 .",
    "particles follow the streamlines determined by equation [ eq : debrogliec ] with three - velocity defined by de broglie as @xmath8 with @xmath9 and where @xmath10 and so on . however , the problem with the use of @xmath11 to define the flow lines , and hence particle trajectories , is that @xmath11 is not always a time - like four vector .",
    "furthermore , as we demonstrate in a specific case below , the time component of the current , @xmath12 is not always positive definite even if one restricts the allowed solutions to superpositions of those with positive frequencies only@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the above is often taken to imply the breakdown of the single - particle interpretation of the klein - gordon equation and to signal the unavoidable effects of negative energies and hence the need for anti - particles in the description .",
    "a general proof of the existence of a non positive - definite time - component of the current has been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we illustrate this point by considering the following simple superposition of two positive frequency eigenstates of the klein - gordon equation @xmath13 and let us assume that @xmath14and @xmath15 are real functions of @xmath16 and that @xmath17and @xmath18 are positive .",
    "the time - component of the current is given by @xmath19 \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar } { m_{0}}\\left [ \\omega _ { 1}\\left| \\phi _",
    "{ 1}\\right| ^{2}+\\omega _ { 2}\\left| \\phi _ { 2}\\right| ^{2}+\\phi _ { 1}\\phi _ { 2}\\left ( \\omega _ { 1}+\\omega _ { 2}\\right ) \\cos \\left ( \\left ( \\omega _ { 1}+\\omega _ { 2}\\right ) t\\right ) % \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this may be backwards pointing in time if @xmath20\\ ] ] and since @xmath21 can be negative the inequality can easily be satisfied .",
    "although electromagnetic potentials are incapable of confining a relativistic particle , scalar potentials can do so .",
    "using such a potential one can create a one - dimensional scalar potential `` box '' of length @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "the eigenstates are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integer and @xmath28 a simple superposition of states serves to illustrate the pathologies of de broglie s formulation .",
    "we consider the state @xmath29 \\label{eq : super}\\ ] ] and for the purposes of the calculation we take @xmath30 and @xmath31    in figure 1 we plot @xmath32 ( dotted line ) , the de broglie three - velocity , given by equation [ debvel ] , ( solid line ) and the time component of the four velocity @xmath33 ( dashed line ) for the state given in equation [ eq : super ] at @xmath34 clearly there are regions in which the three - velocity becomes superluminal ( this is where the three velocity has a magnitude greater than unity in our chosen units ) .",
    "the de broglie three - velocity is discontinuous where @xmath33 changes sign , for the values of the parameters chosen for the plot this occurs at @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( to three decimal places ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the space - time flows for this simple example .",
    "the flows are calculated from the four - velocity with @xmath37 one has closed loops in space - time which are difficult to interpret . as far as we know",
    "de broglie never commented on this pathological situation . to consider this point more carefully one has to consider the meaning of gauss theorem in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "gauss theorem in four - dimensional space - time is @xmath38 where @xmath39 depending on the time - like or space - like character of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "one can interpret this in terms of time - like or space - like conserved flows of @xmath41 through hypersurfaces .",
    "for example , one can consider flow through a world - tube bounded by the hypersurface parallel to the flow and hypersurfaces normal to the flow at each end .",
    "( if the flow crosses a null hypersurface a limiting process must be used . )",
    "consider the application of gauss theorem to the example previously discussed and illustrated in figure 2 where there are closed paths in space - time . in order to discuss the slicing of the flow tube normal to the direction of flow we consider the fermi transport of an orthogonal dyad ( in general a tetrad ) of a time - like and a space - like vector around the closed loop .",
    "this provides a natural way of defining the orientation of the surfaces with respect to the flow as illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "one should note that the orthogonal vectors maintain their orientation with respect to the time and the space axes .",
    "the full details of fermi transport along time - like and space - like curves are given in reference @xcite .",
    "an application of gauss theorem now gives a conserved flow around the closed path in space - time .",
    "there remains the interpretative difficulty associated with backward - pointing time - like flows in regions where this is an invariant characterisation ( e.g. the region of figure 3 bounded by the light - cone and containing the positive portion of the x - axis ) . in all other regions",
    "the space - like flows do not have an invariant characterisation in terms of orientation in time .",
    "it seems , however , that a more careful formulation of the dynamics allows one to remove at least the pathology of the backward - pointing time - like flows , as we now proceed to demonstrate .",
    "in the foregoing we have followed de broglie in formulating the theory in a particular reference frame . however , following the non - covariant treatment ofgitman and tyutin @xcite , and @xcite , the de broglie theory can be cast in covariant form in the following way .    the classical action for a relativistic , spinless particle can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44with @xmath45 a scalar parameter along the path of the particle .",
    "the canonical momenta @xmath46are then given by @xmath47 from which one has the primary constraint @xmath48 decomposing @xmath49 along a unit time - like four - vector @xmath50 @xmath51 and perpendicular to it one has @xmath52 where @xmath53is space - like and @xmath54 .",
    "( in the following the same covariant decomposition notation will be used , the caret accent indicating the space - like part of the vector . )",
    "therefore @xmath55 putting @xmath56 the primary constraint becomes @xmath57 which is a covariant formulation of the constraint . resolving both sides of equation [ eq : canon ] along along @xmath50 and perpendicular to it one has @xmath58 where @xmath59 and both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are scalars .",
    "therefore @xmath62 and since @xmath60 and @xmath63 are of opposite sign , @xmath64 the hamiltonian @xmath65 is given , as usual , by @xmath66 which vanishes along the constraint surface .",
    "following @xcite one can choose a special gauge ( in a covariant way ) as @xmath67 one can now switch to canonical variables @xmath68using a generating function @xmath69 where @xmath70 the new hamiltonian @xmath71 is @xmath72 on the constraint surface .",
    "therefore @xmath73 and since @xmath74@xmath75 as in @xcite , @xmath76is not fixed by the constraints and can be considered as another dynamical variable taking values @xmath77 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the two values of @xmath76 correspond to particle and antiparticle motion .    introducing an external electromagnetic field",
    "@xmath78 one obtains as usual @xmath79 calling @xmath80 and @xmath81 physical time and momenta , respectively one finds @xmath82 where @xmath83 . therefore trajectories with @xmath84 correspond to a particle with charge @xmath85 and those with @xmath86 to a particle with charge @xmath87 one also notes that , since @xmath88 with @xmath89 , the scalar time parameter @xmath90 is positive for both cases ( or negative for both cases ) .    in a given frame with @xmath50 coincident with the time axis @xmath91 .",
    "so following this approach in de broglie s particle theory , remembering the connection of @xmath92 with the canonical momenta one has to take the magnitude of @xmath33 in calculating the three - velocity ; yielding , rather than equation [ debvel ] , in a given frame and in the absence of potentials @xmath93 for the particular case , discussed above , of the square well with the wavefunction @xmath94 defined by [ eq : super ] , this modified form of the velocity is plotted in figure 4 as the solid line , along with @xmath95 as the dotted line , for comparison .",
    "the two forms of the de broglie velocity coincide except where @xmath96is positive .",
    "figure 5 shows the space - time flows calculating using @xmath97 which obviously do not have space - time loops , although the flows still become space - like in certain regions .",
    "elsewhere @xcite,@xcite we have given details of an approach to the definition of particle trajectories for the klein - gordon equation which yields time - like trajectories in all circumstances .",
    "our lorentz invariant description defines the flow of stress - energy - momentum , and hence particle trajectories which follow the flow , through the intrinsic natural four - vector provided by the matter field itself through the eigenvalue equation @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath100 the eigenvalue and @xmath101 the eigenvector . writing a solution @xmath102 of the klein - gordon equation as @xmath103\\ ] ]",
    "the stress - energy - momentum tensor , @xmath104 of the field @xmath102 is given by @xmath105\\delta _",
    "{ \\nu } ^{\\mu } + 2|\\phi |^{2}[(p^{\\mu } p_{\\nu } + s^{\\mu } s_{\\nu } ) ] \\ ] ] once the state @xmath102 is given the stress - energy - momentum tensor can be calculated along with its eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "as we showed in @xcite , one finds a pair of eigenvectors one of which is time - like and the other space - like .",
    "the time - like vector and its eigenvalue determine the flows of energy and the density respectively . applying this approach in this simple",
    ", one - dimensional example yields the one - dimensional three - velocity @xmath106 where @xmath107 more generally ( in more than one dimension ) the velocity is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 for our illustrative example , the three - velocity , given by equation [ eq : vh ] with the state [ eq : super ] is plotted in figure 6 , again for the same parameter values used in the previous plots .",
    "the particle is moving slowly throughout the whole region , with no extremes as exist in the de broglie velocities for this situation .",
    "figure 7 shows the associated trajectories . in the case of the unmodified de broglie velocity the region of this plot contained the space - time vortex , here",
    "we see perfectly regular flow through this region governed by [ eq : vh ]",
    "we have shown that if one wishes to formulate an interpretation of the klein - gordon equation based on individual particle trajectories then this can be done in a consistent manner but only by going beyond the approach originally proposed by de broglie . in de broglie",
    "s approach one has a non positive - definite time - component of the current , closed loops in the space - time flows , space - like particle motions and a rest mass which may become imaginary .",
    "the situation can be improved by formulating the theory in a covariant manner as one consequence of doing this properly is to remove the possibility of backward - pointing time - like flows . however",
    ", this modification of de broglie s theory does not overcome the problems associated with space - like trajectories . a particle - trajectory interpretation which uses the flows defined by the stress - stress - energy - momentum tensor of the klein - gordon field to determine the particle trajectories",
    "does not suffer from the pathologies discussed in de broglie s theory . adopting the latter approach",
    "enables a consistent interpretation of the simple quantum phenomena associated with relativistic particles in terms of well - defined particle trajectories .",
    "at least the obstacles to the construction of a consistent particle interpretation of the klein - gordon equation that we have discussed here can be removed , and a consistent theory developed .",
    "the problems that we have discussed in this paper are often cited as reasons for the rejection of a particle - trajectory interpretation of the klein - gordon equation and the compulsion to adopt a basic field ontology for bosons as suggested by bohm .",
    "we have shown that if one wishes to reject the particle ontology in favour of the field ontology then the justification must be sought elsewhere .",
