    "<S> the processes of merging and splitting dilute - gas bose - einstein condensates are studied in the nonadiabatic , high - density regime . </S>",
    "<S> rich dynamics are found . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the experimental parameters , uniform soliton trains containing more than ten solitons or the formation of a high - density bulge as well as quantum ( or dispersive ) shock waves are observed experimentally within merged becs . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations indicate the formation of many vortex rings . in the case of splitting a bec , the transition from sound - wave formation to dispersive shock - wave formation </S>",
    "<S> is studied by use of increasingly stronger splitting barriers . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments realize prototypical dispersive shock situations .        dilute - gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are a powerful environment for the study of linear and nonlinear dynamics . in this context , the merging and splitting of becs are two particularly important processes that , despite their apparent simplicity , provide access to a variety of different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the interference fringes observed when two becs collide in the low - density regime reveal the fundamental matter wave nature underlying becs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , numerical studies of fast collisions in the high - density regime reveal indications of quantum turbulent behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> slower merging in the high - density regime has experimentally been shown to lead to vortex formation @xcite , providing information about the phase evolution of the merging becs . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies demonstrate that adiabatic merging of becs can lead to soliton formation , too @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a precise understanding of the merging dynamics is also essential from a technological point of view . </S>",
    "<S> for example , splitting and merging processes are fundamental operations in atom interferometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the merging of becs is also an important process in the creation of a `` continuous bec '' @xcite where a condensate was continuously replenished by newly condensed atoms .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we study the physics of merging and splitting becs in the nonadiabatic , high - density regime and use these processes to investigate dispersive hydrodynamics , including dispersive shock waves ( dsws , also referred to as quantum shock waves ) . after merging two becs </S>",
    "<S> , we can observe many solitons ( a soliton train ) . </S>",
    "<S> for low enough atom numbers , the soliton train is uniform , as predicted for a one - dimensional situation @xcite . for higher atom numbers , a high - density bulge emerges , and </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations suggest that this bulge consists of many vortex rings due to a transverse instability of the soliton train . splitting a bec with a repulsive barrier can lead to dsws , and we observe a transition from propagating sound waves to dsws when a sufficiently strong barrier is used . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also find shock dynamics in a different setting , namely when a high - density region in a bec is suddenly released and allowed to spread into a surrounding background of condensed atoms . in this case , the initial high - density peak splits into two peaks that propagate away from each other , and after a sufficient self - steepening of the wavefront , dsws are formed . </S>",
    "<S> these are important prototypical situations that have been discussed in previous theoretical studies @xcite , and our results complement previous experiments that considered either very narrow initial gaps in a bec , produced by a stopped - light technique @xcite , or blast pulses in rotating @xcite and nonrotating @xcite cylindrical geometries . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate intriguing similarities between the hydrodynamics of becs and the propagation of laser light through nonlinear crystals , where related dispersive shock phenomena have also been observed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all our experiments begin with ultracold clouds of @xmath0rb atoms in the @xmath1 = @xmath2 hyperfine state . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are magnetically contained in an elongated ioffe - pritchard type trap with frequencies @xmath3  hz ( the @xmath4-axis is oriented horizontally ) . </S>",
    "<S> repulsive and attractive barriers for the atoms are created with dipole lasers that are far detuned from the rb d - lines at 780  nm and 795  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole laser beams are sent horizontally through the center of the magnetic trap , along the radial ( tightly confining ) @xmath5-direction . in the vertical direction ( @xmath6-axis ) , </S>",
    "<S> the laser waist is much larger than the radial extent of the becs . </S>",
    "<S> dynamics are induced in the bec by rapidly turning a dipole beam on or off . to enlarge the resulting features we employ an antitrapped expansion 2  ms long before imaging @xcite . during this expansion , the aspect ratio of a bec formed without the presence of a dipole barrier changes from 57 for the trapped bec to an aspect ratio of about 3 .    in a first set of experiments , the dynamics of merging two becs in the nonadiabatic , high - density regime are studied . for this , a dipole beam with a wavelength of @xmath7  nm , a power of 3.48  mw and waists of @xmath8 m and @xmath9 m is used , creating a repulsive barrier with a height of 490  nk for the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the total atom number for the experiments shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](a - f ) is about @xmath10 atoms . for a single bec confined in the magnetic trap , </S>",
    "<S> this would imply a chemical potential of @xmath11  nk . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the presence of the dipole beam leads to two clearly separated becs ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is turned on before the atoms are evaporatively cooled to form a bec . after a bec has formed on both sides of the barrier and no surrounding thermal cloud is visible , the dipole beam is rapidly turned off within less than 250  ns . </S>",
    "<S> we let the dynamics evolve in the magnetic trap for a variable evolution period before starting the expansion imaging . directly after turning the dipole barrier off , the condensates smoothly expand toward each other ( fig .  [ singlepokyseq](b ) ) . this behavior can be described by the well - known dam - breaking problem whereby a sharp density gradient develops into a rarefaction wave ( as opposed to a shock wave ) when the background density is zero ( see e.g. @xcite ) . shortly after the becs have collided at the center of the trap , a pronounced bulge of higher atom density forms in the collision plane ( fig .  [ singlepokyseq](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently this density bulge spreads out from the center of the trap ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](c - e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> very pronounced dark notches are observed to form within the high - density bulge as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](d ) . as the bulge spreads out from the collision plane , more and more notches </S>",
    "<S> are formed to fill the extent of the density bulge with an average spacing of roughly 8  @xmath12 m to 11  @xmath12 m . </S>",
    "<S> after about 55  ms , the bulge and the notches have spread over the entire extent of the condensate ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the long lifetime , discrete nature , and large amplitude of the notches suggests that they are nonlinear coherent structures rather than simple sound waves . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that a soliton train initially develops and a bulge region is formed where the solitons decay into a large number of vortex rings , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](h - j ) and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , vortex rings in becs have been observed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are difficult to detect unambiguously in our experimental images that are integrated along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> fine fringes appear adjacent to the bulge region as can be seen , e.g. , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fine fringes , together with the steepness of the wavefronts delimiting the density bulge region , are indicative of dsws . </S>",
    "<S> the merging process finally results in an axial breathing - mode excitation of the bec .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.375 in    the qualitative features of the evolution are fairly independent of most experimental parameters . for example </S>",
    "<S> , use of two becs with an initial total atom number of @xmath13 atoms and a dipole beam with waists of @xmath14 m and @xmath9 m gives qualitatively the same results ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the atom number is strongly reduced , we observe a transition in the merging dynamics , both experimentally and numerically , from the generation of a high - density bulge to the generation of a uniform soliton train with no bulge . a typical image of such a soliton train is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq](g ) for 22000 atoms , a dipole beam power of @xmath15w , an evolution time of 27  ms and an expansion time of 1  ms ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a one - dimensional analysis akin to that in @xcite reveals that the soliton train can be interpreted as the result of the interaction of two degenerate rarefaction waves resulting from the dam - breaking problem . a detailed analysis of this transition is beyond the scope of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.375 in    in a second set of experiments , we investigated the dynamics of splitting a bec with a repulsive barrier that is suddenly turned on in the center of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> for very weak barriers that only slightly modify the bec density , the sudden turn - on leads to the propagation of sound waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong barriers , in contrast , lead to dsws . </S>",
    "<S> we first create becs with @xmath16 atoms in the magnetic trap without the presence of the dipole barrier . then a dipole beam with waists of @xmath17 m and @xmath9 m is rapidly turned on and left on for a variable evolution time , after which the antitrapped expansion procedure is started . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid turn - on of the dipole beam produces two density peaks that spread out to either side , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured propagation speed of these peaks in the central region of the becs is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ soundspeed ] for various powers of the dipole beam @xcite . for the lowest powers , the speed is in full agreement with the calculated longitudinal speed of sound , 3.8  mm / s @xcite . at these low powers , the density peaks are barely visible in the cloud . for stronger dipole beams , </S>",
    "<S> the propagation speed increases above the speed of sound , and for sufficiently strong beams the obtained images change qualitatively due to dispersive shock formation with two associated speeds . </S>",
    "<S> for laser powers above approximately 0.6  mw , fine fringes appear in front of the propagating peaks . </S>",
    "<S> when the dipole beam exceeds a power of roughly 1.2  mw , solitons are formed in the region between the two wavefronts , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](d ) . for an oblate , rather than cigar - shaped geometry , </S>",
    "<S> related ring - shaped structures have been interpreted in the context of dsws in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations @xcite suggest that this behavior is qualitatively described as follows . </S>",
    "<S> two peaks in the density and outward superfluid velocity are generated by the repulsive dipole beam . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks break when the `` entropy '' condition is satisfied @xcite , causing the generation of two dsws on the inner and outer edges of each peak . </S>",
    "<S> due to a transverse instability , these quasi - one - dimensional dsws break up into many vortex rings , leading to interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of dsws has been studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> deriving an analytic expression for the dsw speeds is complicated by the generation of vortex rings and wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , the dependence of pulse propagation speed on the dipole laser power is described reasonably well by a square - root dependence , as shown by the fitted curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ soundspeed ] .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.375 in    our experiments reveal that rapidly switching on a weak dipole barrier merely leads to two density peaks that spread out ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](c ) ) , whereas for strong barriers , soliton formation is observed in the wake behind the wavefronts ( fig .  [ picturematrix](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar transition also exists for the merging of becs : if two becs are initially separated by a strong barrier , soliton dynamics are observed after turning the barrier off , as described in detail above ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ singlepokyseq ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , the initial dipole barrier is so weak that it merely produces a small density suppression in an initial bec , a density bulge that does not contain solitons ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](a ) ) appears after the turn - off . </S>",
    "<S> pulsing a barrier on for a short time combines the effects of turning on and turning off a barrier ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ picturematrix](e ) , ( f ) ) ; see also @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.375 in    yet another , different prototypical dsw situation comes about when a local high - density peak in a bec is suddenly released and is allowed to spread out into a surrounding background of lower density . </S>",
    "<S> we can realize this experimentally by replacing the 660  nm dipole laser with an 830  nm laser , leading to an attractive dipole potential . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](a - d ) such an attractive dipole beam with a waist of @xmath18 m and @xmath19 m and a power of 61  @xmath12w is sent through the center of the magnetic trap in the radial direction . </S>",
    "<S> evaporative cooling in the presence of the combined optical and magnetic potential leads to a bec with a localized high - density peak in its center ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the dipole beam is suddenly switched off after the formation of the bec , the central high - density peak spreads out into the surrounding parts of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the high density peak does not remain a single peak but quickly splits into two peaks ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](b ) ) that subsequently travel outward in opposite directions ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](c ,  d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed such splitting is expected from theory @xcite and has been observed in nonlinear optics @xcite . following @xcite , one can show that in the quasi - one - dimensional regime two counterpropagating dsws interacting with trailing rarefaction waves are generated in such a situation . </S>",
    "<S> for the parameters in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](a - d ) , the measured propagation speed of the two propagating peaks is 4.34  mm / s . when the initial dipole beam power is reduced , the measured speed decreases and approaches the longitudinal speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> when a stronger dipole beam with a power of 183  @xmath12w is used , again two peaks form and spread out ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](e ) ) , but now dsws form , marked by solitons in the inner region and strong ripples in the outer regions of the bec ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple](f ) ) ; see also @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our experiments realize several prototypical situations for dispersive shock wave formation and demonstrate the transition from sound wave propagation to dispersive shock dynamics as increasingly stronger perturbations are applied . </S>",
    "<S> several aspects of this behavior , such as the splitting of an initial single peak into two ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dimple ] ) followed by the formation of dispersive shock waves , are very similar to those observed in nonlinear optics . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the generality of our results and showcases the usefulness of becs in the study of nonlinear wave dynamics .    </S>",
