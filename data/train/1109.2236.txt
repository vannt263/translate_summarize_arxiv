    "hadronic three - meson vertex functions or form factors are basic inputs to phenomenological theories of nuclear processes .",
    "they play an important role in cross section calculation , which may vary in a few orders of magnitude if they are considered .",
    "the form factor depends on the momentum @xmath5 and some parameters . as usual",
    ", the form factor is parametrized by _",
    "ad hoc _ function , which is not unique and can be gaussian , exponential or monopolar . from the parametrization",
    ", we can extract a cutoff parameter @xmath6 which is associated with the sharpness of the form factor .",
    "therefore , knowing its precise functional form and its cutoff parameter are essential .",
    "some years ago , we started a program to compute form factors with the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite . our group has developed a method which leads to less ambiguities in the determination of the coupling constant .",
    "the method consists of computing two form factors of the same three meson process : one form factor is evaluated when the heavy meson is off - shell and the other form factor is obtained when the light meson is off - shell . by extrapolating both form factors to the momentum @xmath7 equal to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the off - shell particle , we obtain the coupling constant of the vertex .",
    "after our pioneer @xmath10 work @xcite , we concluded that when the form factor tends to be harder as a function of @xmath5,the off - shell meson in the vertex is heavy , which means the cut - off parameter is larger . a persistent study of vertices involving charmed mesons ( @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite ) , motivated by the development of effective theories related to charm particles interaction , showed a similar conclusion in all of them .",
    "however , in recent years , due to the precise measurements of @xmath2 decays performed by belle , bes and babar , the physics of @xmath2 meson has gained a new relevance .",
    "the observed @xmath19 by cdf collaboration @xcite and @xmath20 by cdf and d0 collaboration @xcite stimulated our interest in the physics of bottom mesons interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the unobserved @xmath21 state and the axial @xmath22 have been interpreted as hadronic bound states ( hadronic molecules ) , because their masses are close to the thresholds of the corresponding hadronic pairs . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors used a phenomenological lagrangian approach to calculate the strong and radiative decay of these new mesons , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which were considered as bound states of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons respectively , to provide more information about some properties .",
    "in particular , the coupling constant of @xmath25 vertex was an input in this calculation .",
    "considering that the form factors are introduced in the development of effective theories to study bottom interactions , in this paper , we calculated the form factors and coupling constant of the @xmath26 vertex , using the qcdsr method , which is the only method that permits to extract the coupling constant of the three meson processes without any dependence on other empirical coupling constant . therefore , we evaluate two form factors , one when @xmath2 is the off - shell particle and another when @xmath1 is the off - shell and extrapolate these results to obtain the coupling constant @xmath27 . we also want to estimate the uncertainties of the qcdsr method by analyzing different sources of errors .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the qcdsr technique ; in ii.a , the qcd side for this vertex and in ii.b , the phenomenological side . in section iii",
    ", we show the results ; in section iv , we estimate the uncertainties and , finally , conclude .",
    "following our previous works , specifically in ref.@xcite , the three - point function associated with the @xmath0 vertex is givem by @xmath29 for an off - shell @xmath2 meson , and : @xmath30 for an off - shell @xmath31 meson .",
    "the expressions for the vertices ( [ correboff ] ) and ( [ correkoff ] ) contain different numbers of lorentz structures , and each structure can be a different sum rule ( sr ) to be considered .",
    "equations  ( [ correboff ] ) and ( [ correkoff ] ) can be calculated in two different ways : using quark degrees of freedom the theoretical or the qcd side and using hadronic degrees of freedom the phenomenological side . in the qcd side ,",
    "the correlators are evaluated using the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) , which incorporates the effects of the qcd vacuum through an infinite series of condensates of increasing dimension .",
    "the phenomenological side is written in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom , which is the responsible for the introduction of the form factors , decay constants and masses . after performing a double borel transformation ,",
    "both representations are matched invoking the quark - hadron global duality .      in the ope or theoretical side ,",
    "each meson interpolating field appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ correboff ] ) and ( [ correkoff ] ) can be written in terms of the quark field operators . for the @xmath2 off - shell case , eq .",
    "( [ correboff ] ) , we use the following meson currents : & & j^b^*_s_(0)=    & & j^b_5(y)= i |q _ 5 b + & & j^k_(x)=|q _ _ 5 s and when the @xmath1 is off - shell , we have chosen the pseudoscalar current for it , following the same procedure as in previous works as @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite : & & j^k_5(x)= i |q _ 5 s , this choice of current is motivated by the coupling constant that is obtained by extrapolating the @xmath34 to momentum @xmath5 equal to the square mass of the particle , that in this case will be @xmath35 . otherwise , if we use the axial vector current when @xmath1 meson is off - shell , the sum rule obtained is also good and the coupling constant result is very similar to the pseudoscalar case .",
    "the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the up , down , strange and bottom quark fields , respectively .",
    "each one of these currents has the same quantum numbers of the associated mesons .    in order to obtain the qcd side",
    ", we use the cutkosky rule and we obtain an expression where all the possible structures appear . we can obtain a sum rule for each structure that have an invariant amplitude , which can be written in a double dispersion relation over the virtualities @xmath40 and @xmath41 , holding @xmath42 fixed : @xmath43 where @xmath44 equals the double discontinuity of the amplitude @xmath45 , @xmath46 index means @xmath2 off - shell or @xmath1 off - shell , @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are integration limits equal to @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath2 off - shell and @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath1 off - shell .",
    "the invariant amplitudes receive contributions from all terms in the ope .",
