    "<S> we consider the problem of placing @xmath0 nonattacking queens on a symmetric @xmath1 toeplitz matrix . as in the @xmath2-queens problem on a chessboard </S>",
    "<S> , two queens may attack each other if they share a row or a column in the matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however , the usual diagonal restriction is replaced by specifying that queens may attack other queens that occupy squares with the same number value in the matrix . we will show that @xmath0 nonattacking queens can be placed on such a matrix if and only if @xmath3 .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ams subject classification : * 05b99    * keywords * : @xmath2-queens problem    the @xmath2-queens problem , a generalization of the original 8-queens problem , asks whether @xmath0 nonattacking queens can be placed on an @xmath1 chessboard in such a way that no queen can attack another , i.e. , so that no two queens are placed in the same row or column or on the same diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> the problem has been extensively studied since the mid-1800s ; for a brief summary of the history , see @xcite . a familiar extension of the problem ( due to polya ) asks the same question for queens placed on a toroidal chessboard . </S>",
    "<S> vardi also considers the toroidal semiqueens problem , in which a semiqueen may move  ... like a rook or bishop , but only on positive broken diagonals . \" </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see figure [ fig : vardifig ] . ) to clarify the phrase  positive broken diagonals \" without reference to a figure , number the rows and columns of an @xmath1 chessboard from 1 to @xmath0 , starting with the top left square . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4th positive broken diagonal then consists of all squares labeled @xmath5 for @xmath6 .        in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we modify the chessboard again ; now it corresponds to a symmetric toeplitz matrix . </S>",
    "<S> a toeplitz matrix has constant negative diagonals , i.e. , entry @xmath7 equals entry @xmath8 whenever @xmath9 @xcite . in a symmetric toeplitz matrix </S>",
    "<S> , we further require that entry @xmath7 equal entry @xmath8 whenever @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> queens may attack each other if they share a row or a column , or if both are on squares belonging to a set of the form @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we then ask when @xmath0 nonattacking queens can be placed on such an @xmath1 chessboard . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that @xmath0 nonattacking queens can be placed on such a chessboard if and only if @xmath12 .        to solve this problem </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the matrix @xmath13 with entries given by @xmath14 , for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath13 is solvable if and only if we can select @xmath0 entries from @xmath13 with values @xmath16 so that no two entries selected lie in the same row or the same column . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , @xmath13 is solvable if and only if there exists a permutation @xmath17 such that @xmath18 assumes each of the values @xmath19 exactly once . </S>",
    "<S> ( we will use both formulations throughout this paper . ) a solution set for @xmath13 is a set of pairs @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a permutation demonstrating @xmath13 s solvability . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as indicated in figure [ fig : toep ] , solution sets for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    [ thm : solvable ] @xmath13 is solvable if and only if @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a counting argument to show that @xmath13 is not solvable for @xmath26 , then construct a solution set for @xmath13 when @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath28 is a solution for @xmath13 . as @xmath21 is a permutation </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that    @xmath29    as @xmath18 achieves each of the values @xmath30 exactly once , we have    @xmath31    however , it is also the case that @xmath32 simplifying , we obtain @xmath33 using and gives @xmath34 or @xmath35 simplifying the right - hand side and recognizing that the left - hand side is an integer yields @xmath36 suppose first that @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath0 is even , @xmath38 is odd . </S>",
    "<S> but this together with @xmath39 implies @xmath40 , a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> thus no solutions exist for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> now assume that @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> a short calculation shows that @xmath42 , so @xmath43 ( under the assumption that @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> but @xmath45 contradicts @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there are no solutions when @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> it remains to show that @xmath13 is solvable when @xmath46 mod @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof will be done by induction on @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining two matrices that can be obtained from @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath48 is the matrix obtained from @xmath13 by deleting the first column and the last row of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> * @xmath49 is obtained from @xmath13 by deleting the first and last row as well as the first and the @xmath50 column of @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : derive ] illustrates @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we will call @xmath48 solvable if we can select entries with values @xmath51 , one from each row and each column ; likewise @xmath49 will be called solvable if we can select entries with values @xmath52 , one from each row and each column . </S>",
    "<S> note that if @xmath48 is solvable , then so is its transpose , @xmath53 , which is obtained from @xmath13 by removing the first row and the last column . </S>",
    "<S> we will not distinguish between @xmath48 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for @xmath49 and @xmath54 .        </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath55 is solvable , without loss of generality we can assume that the @xmath56 entry was selected as the entry of value @xmath57 , see figure [ fig : derive ] . </S>",
    "<S> by symmetry we may assume that the @xmath58 entry was selected as the entry of value @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that removing the @xmath56 entry from the solution set of @xmath55 gives a solution set for @xmath48 and removing both the @xmath56 and the @xmath58 entries gives a solution for @xmath49 . similarly adding one or both of these entries to the solution of @xmath49 results in solutions for @xmath48 and @xmath55 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , for fixed @xmath0 , either all three of @xmath60 and @xmath49 are solvable or none of them is .    </S>",
    "<S> solutions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are provided in figure [ fig : toep ] . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the result for all @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution set depends on the remainder of @xmath62 , so we write @xmath63 , where @xmath64 may be 0 , 1 , or 2 . cases 2 and 3 are similar to case 1 and thus will be written out in less detail .    </S>",
    "<S> * case 1 : @xmath65*. we build a solution set @xmath66 as follows : select entries @xmath67 which have values @xmath68 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> also select entries @xmath69 which have values @xmath70 and finally select the entry @xmath71 with value @xmath72 . thus far @xmath66 contains all values @xmath73 and no two selections are in the same row or column .    </S>",
    "<S> the entries that are still available to be selected ( i.e. , those lying in a row or column not yet selected ) have indices @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 . as </S>",
    "<S> each entry is equal to the difference between its row and column index , we can subtract @xmath77 from each of the row and column indices and obtain the matrix with row labels @xmath78 through @xmath72 and column labels @xmath79 through @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix we obtain is @xmath81 with the last row and the first column deleted , i.e. , it is @xmath82 . thus if @xmath82 has a solution set @xmath83 , adding this solution set to the entries we already selected completes @xmath66 . by induction we know @xmath82 is solvable as long as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> however it is easy to check that @xmath85 if and only if @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> * case 2 : @xmath87 . * select entries @xmath88 and @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> so far we have selected values with entries @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the entries that are still available to be selected have indices @xmath74 such that @xmath91 and @xmath76 . by subtracting @xmath72 from both the column and row labels </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the matrix that remains is @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> again , it is easy to check that @xmath85 if and only if @xmath93 or 1 @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by the induction hypothesis , we can complete the solution set @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> * case 3 : @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> * begin by selecting entries @xmath96 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 . the values we have selected so far are @xmath99 . the entries that are still available to be selected are those with indices @xmath74 such that @xmath91 or @xmath100 and @xmath101 . by subtracting @xmath77 from all row and column labels we see that these are the entries of the transpose of @xmath102 which by the induction hypothesis is solvable as long as @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> again we see that @xmath104 if and only if @xmath103 , and thus we can complete the solution set @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> a symmetric toeplitz chessboard is an @xmath1 chessboard in which the squares are labeled with numbers so that the labels along each descending diagonal are constant and the labeling is symmetric with respect to the main descending diagonal . a queen placed on the chessboard may attack other queens in the same row or column as well as those placed on a square with the same number value .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : queencor ] it is possible to place @xmath0 queens on an @xmath1 symmetric toeplitz chessboard so that no two queens may attack each other if and only if @xmath3 .    without loss of generality assume the squares of the chessboard are labeled with the entries of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then placing the nonattacking queens on the chessboard is equivalent to finding a solution for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the result follows by theorem [ thm : solvable ] .    </S>",
    "<S> corollary [ thm : queencor ] establishes the existence ( and nonexistence ) of solutions to the @xmath2-queens problem on the particular modification of the chessboard discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , variants of this problem analogous to those on other chessboards remain to be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance :    1 .   what is the minimum number of queens necessary for each square of the board to either contain a queen or to be attacked by at least one queen ? </S>",
    "<S> ( what is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set , i.e. , what is the domination number ? ) 2 .   when @xmath105 , what is the maximum number of queens that can be placed on the board so that no queen can attack another ? </S>",
    "<S> ( what is the maximum cardinality of an independent dominating set ? ) 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> substitute another type of chess piece for queens and ask analogous questions . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> how many ( fundamental ) solutions exist for each question ?    </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ thm : n-1 ] resolves the second question .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : n-1 ] it is possible to place @xmath57 nonattacking queens on an @xmath1 chessboard corresponding to a symmetric toeplitz matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide such a placement of @xmath57 nonattacking queens as follows .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> place a queen on square @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   for each @xmath107 from 1 to @xmath108 , place a queen on square @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   for each @xmath110 from 3 to @xmath111 , place a queen on square @xmath112 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : n-1fig ] indicates this placement . to facilitate detail - checking , </S>",
    "<S> we examine @xmath0 even and @xmath0 odd separately .        </S>",
    "<S> * case 1 : @xmath0 is even*. examine the rows occupied by queens . </S>",
    "<S> step 1 places a queen in row 1 ; step 2 places queens in rows @xmath113 ; step 3 places queens in rows @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 queens occur once in every row with the exception of row 2 only . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we have queens in column 1 ( step 1 ) , in columns @xmath115 ( step 2 ) , and in columns @xmath116 ( step 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> every column except column @xmath117 has exactly one queen . calculating the differences of the row and column indices </S>",
    "<S> shows that there is exactly one queen in each of the diagonals indexed by 0 ( step 1 ) , by @xmath118 ( step 2 ) , and by @xmath119 ( step 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( the diagonal indexed by @xmath57 has no queen . )    * case 2 : @xmath0 is odd*. rows occupied by a queen are row 1 ( step 1 ) , rows @xmath120 ( step 2 ) , and rows @xmath121 ( step 3 ) . only row 2 </S>",
    "<S> has no queen , so the other rows have one queen each . </S>",
    "<S> columns occupied by a queen are column 1 ( step 1 ) , columns @xmath122 ( step 2 ) , and columns @xmath123 ( step 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only column with no queen is column @xmath124 , so again we conclude that all the remaining columns contain exactly one queen . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that , as @xmath0 is odd , @xmath124 may be written as @xmath125 , and @xmath126 when @xmath0 is even , so the expression @xmath125 identifies the column without a queen for all values of @xmath0 . ) </S>",
    "<S> finally , we check the diagonals occupied by queens : diagonal 0 ( step 1 ) , diagonals @xmath127 ( step 2 ) , and diagonals @xmath128 ( step 3 ) . as before , </S>",
    "<S> only the diagonal indexed by @xmath57 has no queen ; the others have exactly one each . </S>"
