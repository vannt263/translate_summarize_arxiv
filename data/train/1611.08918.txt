    "in the last two decades , the complex networks perspective has been widely used to analyze diverse socioeconomic phenomena , such as professional collaborations @xcite , international trade networks @xcite , business networks @xcite and also tourism @xcite .",
    "the case of tourism is noteworthy .",
    "this is a geographical , economic and social phenomenon which consists on the temporary movement of some people ( tourists ) from origin countries to certain destinations , where they spend time enjoying some services ( visiting natural or man - made monuments , restaurants , going shopping and other activities ) .",
    "the big amount of agents involved in this industry ( visitors , lodgings , air carriers , local suppliers , services in destination , etc . ) and the strong interdependence among them make this industry to be considered a complex adaptive system and susceptible to be analyzed using complex network methodology @xcite .    nevertheless , the application of the complex networks approach on tourism research is still limited as compared to other fields .",
    "one of the reasons is the sample size , which is usually small in the real networks analyzed so far .",
    "this is due to the common methodology applied for the data collection , based on interviews of agents involved , which makes that obtaining samples larger than @xmath0 nodes is monetary and time costly @xcite . regarding the issues explored , many of the previous contributions make statistical analyses to characterize the topological structure of a specific tourism network @xcite or modularity analysis to detect communities @xcite .",
    "other papers go further and apply the superedges approach to tourism data @xcite , study the knowledge diffusion in the supply network @xcite , the influence of network topology on social capital of hotels @xcite or the movement pattern of tourists in destinations @xcite .",
    "looking at the specific definition of the tourism network used , some of the contributions above study the supply - side network , where nodes contains stakeholders , such as hoteliers and travel agencies , which are linked through business associations or website links @xcite .",
    "other networks include locations who are linked by travelers @xcite .",
    "unlike to the rest , smallwood et al .",
    "@xcite analyze the tourist network combining the demand ( tourist ) and supply - side ( activities / attractions ) .    to the extent of our knowledge ,",
    "the application of complex networks to analyze the growth dynamic of the supply network in a tourism destination is still unexplored .",
    "however , this is a major issue in tourism research , since it would allow identifying the main forces leading to a destination from the initiating to mature stage and provide key factors about its next future evolution .    in this regard ,",
    "the adaptation of evolving models of bipartite networks to the tourism context is an useful way to represent the phenomenon . evolving models",
    "has been theorized for one - mode networks @xcite and extensions to several cases of bipartite networks have been also proposed @xcite . following the same basis of one - mode evolving networks ,",
    "these models assume that new nodes of both categories appear in every time step .",
    "the major difference among them is the specific combination of random and preferential attachment ( pa ) rules to link new and old nodes .",
    "for example , ramasco et al .",
    "@xcite assume new nodes are attached following an unidirectional combination of these rules ( e.g. , new movies select an amount of old and new actors ) , while tian et al .",
    "@xcite and zhang et al .",
    "@xcite assume bidirectional pa rule for selecting links between nodes from two categories , allowing rewiring which follows pa and/or random attachment rules .",
    "the latter models have been extended by zhang et al .",
    "@xcite including weight in the links . alternatively , noh et al .",
    "@xcite create a growing model to represent the community growth through group membership , assuming that the join of a new member to an old group or creation of new groups is produced according old member s degree and random rules .",
    "finally , nacher et al .",
    "@xcite adapt a bipartite growing network to represent protein - domain network including a copy mechanism and random rule for new nodes . as it was the case for one - mode distributions , the long - term degree distribution in the contributions above varies from shifted power - law to exponential distribution , depending on the specific weight of pa or random attachment rules .",
    "this paper proposes an evolving model of bipartite network to represent the development of the supply network in a tourism destination .",
    "the model explains how the supply components in the destination grow and are connected each other through tourists behavior .",
    "specifically , the model describes a social network where lodgings are linked with services .",
    "a link appears if a representative tourist staying in a certain lodging enjoys a service .",
    "the propensity to enjoy a specific service follows a combination of preferential and random attachment rules . in the long term",
    ", services degree follows a shifted power - law or exponential distribution .",
    "the model estimations are tested with real data coming form a tourist area in gran canaria , spain , collected from recommendations made by visitors in the booking web - site tripadvisor.com .",
    "the results show good agreement between theoretical , numerical and real data for the service degree distribution .",
    "the one - mode projection does not show so good fit results between numerical and theoretical data , due in part to the low order of convergence of the degree distribution to the asymptotic state .",
    "model limitations and future research are commented in the conclusions section .",
    "an evolving network is proposed to explain the supply growth in a certain destination .",
    "we assume two categories of nodes , lodgings ( @xmath1 ) and services ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "lodgings include the accommodation units in the destination , such as hotels , apartments , bed&breakfast , etc . , and services include all the activities ( visiting monuments , restaurants , etc . ) that the tourist can make during the stay .",
    "the model shows how the links between elements of these categories appear along time until achieving an asymptotic network structure .",
    "we start at time @xmath3 with an initial bipartite network , which is represented by a triple @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the initial lodgings and services in the destination , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the network only includes links between elements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the existence of a representative tourist in every lodging .",
    "a link between a lodging @xmath11 and service @xmath12 appears if the representative tourist of lodging @xmath13 visits service @xmath14 during his / her staying in the destination .",
    "translated into real visits , a link would mean that a high enough number of tourists hosted in @xmath13 visits service @xmath14 .",
    "so , the links are unweighted and undirected .",
    "additionally , we assume them permanent along time , which means that , once a service is enjoyed by a high enough amount of tourists staying in a certain lodging , the preference for this service is maintained by successive guests . by simplicity , we also assume that every lodging includes exactly @xmath15 links to services , with @xmath16 .",
    "the bipartite network grows as follows . at any time @xmath17 ,",
    "a new lodging and @xmath18 new services are created in the destination .",
    "we assume that the representative tourist of all new hotels visit @xmath15 different services , selected between the old and new ones , following the rule : a ) a percentage @xmath19 $ ] of them at random ; b ) the rest by linear pa according to service s degree , so the higher the current links to a service , the higher the probability to be visited by tourists in the new lodging .",
    "this tourist s behavior rule is sustained by previous theoretical and empirical studies on within destination movements of tourists @xcite .",
    "we note @xmath20 the degree of service @xmath14 at time @xmath21 .",
    "next , we derive some equations to describe the evolution of @xmath22 .",
    "previously , we note @xmath23 and @xmath24 the number of services and lodgings at time @xmath21 , respectively . since @xmath9",
    ", we have @xmath25 .",
    "the relationship between the average degree of lodgings and services is as follows : @xmath26 , so @xmath27 . naming @xmath28 the event that service @xmath14 is linked by a new lodging at time @xmath29 , the probability of this event is @xmath30= c\\frac{(1-\\phi)s_j(t)}{\\sum_js_j(t ) } + c\\frac{\\phi}{s(t)}. \\label{prob1}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side in ( [ prob1 ] ) is the probability that one of the @xmath15 links coming from the new lodging goes to service @xmath14 via pa , so it depends on its current degree @xmath20 .",
    "the second term is the probability that service @xmath14 be attached by one of these new links at random .",
    "applying the relationship between @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the average degrees @xmath33 and @xmath34 described above , the probability ( [ prob1 ] ) can be simplified into @xmath35 now , assuming @xmath36 and using the continuous time approximation , the evolution of @xmath22 can be described by @xmath37 subject to the initial condition @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the time when service @xmath14 is included in the network .",
    "the solution of ( [ evsjt ] ) is @xmath40 in order to derive the probability distribution of @xmath22 in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath41 ) , we make use that the age of a random selected service @xmath14 at time @xmath21 follows an homogeneous distribution @xmath42 , since the number of services included in the network at every time is the same .",
    "therefore , making some calculations on ( [ sol_evsjt ] ) , the cumulative probability for @xmath20 can be written @xmath43 now , the distribution probability can be approximated by @xmath44 assuming @xmath21 sufficiently large , we have @xmath45 depending on the research field , this is called a shifted power - law @xcite or pareto distribution @xcite . in the extreme cases of parameter @xmath46 , the distribution ( [ dist_s ] ) fluctuates from a power - law @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) to an exponential distribution ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the heavy tails presented in case of adoption of pure pa rule are also produced for extreme values of parameters in other evolving bipartite network models @xcite .",
    "an identical shifted power - law exponent than the ba model ( @xmath51 ) is obtained for @xmath52 .",
    "the first moment is , as expected , @xmath53 and the second moment is @xmath54 if @xmath55 and diverges in other case .",
    "according to this projection , service @xmath14 and @xmath56 are linked if they are both linked to the same lodging in the bipartite network . in other words , a link appears between both services if they are visited by the representative tourist staying in one lodging .",
    "let us define @xmath57 the degree of service @xmath14 in the one - mode projection .",
    "the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath22 is the following : @xmath58 the first term on the right includes all links to other services from a lodging connected to @xmath14 .",
    "it is possible that the connection to other service @xmath56 is duplicated if those services ( @xmath14 and @xmath56 ) are visited by tourists staying in two different lodgings ( @xmath13 and @xmath59 ) . in this case ,",
    "services @xmath60 and lodgings @xmath61 form an x - motif , as it is illustrated in figure 1 . the second term @xmath62 represents the number of x - motifs which include service @xmath14 .",
    "the degree @xmath57 is obtained by subtracting the duplicates to all links from service @xmath14 .     and",
    "services @xmath60.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]    it is expected than the number of x - motifs in the bipartite network tends to be a null - measure set as time evolves .",
    "in fact , this is proven in the next section .",
    "so , we can assume in ( [ as1 ] ) that @xmath63 for large values of @xmath21 and the one - mode degree of service @xmath14 can be approximated by @xmath64 .",
    "starting from the distribution ( [ dist_s ] ) , we can obtain the probability distribution @xmath65 in the same way as in @xcite . applying the change - of - variable formula , we have after some calculations @xmath66 which is again a shifted power - law distribution .",
    "next , we show that the probability of finding an x - motif including service @xmath14 in the network at time @xmath21 , @xmath67 , is null when @xmath41 . additionally , we estimate its order of convergence to zero , which will be below 1 .",
    "this low order of convergence makes that these motifs , neglected in the one - mode degree distribution estimation ( [ dist_k ] ) , influence on the fit of the theoretical model to numerical simulations for short time horizons .",
    "we name @xmath68 the event that service @xmath14 and @xmath56 links to a common lodging at any time before @xmath29 .",
    "below we present the probability that a lodging introduced at time @xmath29 links service @xmath14 and any other one such that both have been previously linked by other lodging , @xmath69 \\simeq \\sum_{j^\\prime \\neq j } p\\left [ l_j^t \\right ] p\\left [ l_{j^\\prime}^t / l_j^t \\right ] p\\left [ l_{jj^\\prime}^t \\right].\\label{prob3a}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we have disregarded the lower order terms of the probability on the left and assume that events @xmath70 and @xmath68 are independent .",

    "this is a first theoretical and empirical analysis of the structure of the lodging - service network in a tourism destination .",
    "the model provides a realistic approximation of the real supply network , but it includes several limitations : ( i ) distance is not currently considered in the attachment rules , although it is a factor that influence on the tourist s decision to visit a specific service ; ( ii ) rewiring of established links is not allowed , what indicates that , once visited , a service is permanently visited by next tourists hosted in a specific lodging : ( iii ) removing of lodgings / services due to aging or closure is not included either .",
    "our future research will face these limitations with new extensions of the model .",
