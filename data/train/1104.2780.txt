    "upcoming ground - based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , geo - hf @xcite and lcgt @xcite are expected to be limited by thermal noise in their most sensitive frequency band around @xmath8hz .",
    "currently , strategies for detectors beyond the 2nd generation , such as the einstein telescope @xcite , are being developed aiming for a ten times better sensitivity . following",
    "levin s approach @xcite mechanical dissipation located at a mirror front surface contributes more than the same dissipation within the substrate .",
    "the dominant contribution to thermal noise in the detection band of advanced detectors arises from multilayer coatings made of tantala and silica , used for highly reflective test mass mirrors at a laser wavelength of @xmath3 nm @xcite .",
    "hence , a reduction of the amount of mechanically lossy coating material is expected to improve the coating brownian thermal noise of a test mass mirror .",
    "one approach being considered is based on resonant waveguide grating structures as a substitute for commonly used multilayer coatings . in particular , broadband waveguide grating structures under normal incidence have been proposed as an alternative concept for test mass mirrors , providing high reflectivity while having significantly less @xcite , or perhaps even no @xcite , additional coating material .",
    "both concepts have been successfully realized and tested in bench - top cavity experiments where the highest reflectivities seen so far are @xmath9 at @xmath3 nm @xcite and @xmath10 at @xmath11 nm @xcite .    here ,",
    "we report on the next step towards the implementation of waveguide grating mirrors in large - scale gravitational wave detectors , namely their usage as a coupling mirror in a fully suspended low - noise prototype environment .",
    "therefore , the glasgow prototype facility @xcite was commissioned to incorporate a custom made waveguide grating mirror in a @xmath0 m linear fabry - perot cavity .",
    "we could demonstrate stable operation of the waveguide cavity with a measured finesse of about @xmath1 .",
    "the waveguide grating design was based on a tantala layer and silica substrate having an additional etch stop layer of al@xmath5o@xmath6 , which allowed us to define the grating depth accurately in the fabrication process .",
    "its reflectivity was determined to be @xmath12 , which is the highest reflectivity of such a device reported at a laser wavelength of @xmath3 nm so far .",
    "a nanostructured waveguide layer can provide resonant excitation of an incoupling light field , which results in anomalies of its reflection coefficient based on leaky waveguide modes as first found by hessel and oliner @xcite and later experimentally confirmed for a first and zeroth diffraction order @xcite .",
    "this property is , for instance , widely investigated for use in narrowband filter applications @xcite",
    ". however , broadband designs under normal incidence as investigated in @xcite are favourable for the purpose of highly reflective surface mirrors in high - precision interferometric experiments , since they are less sensitive to parameter deviations .",
    "the basic principle of a waveguide grating mirror under normal incidence is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : architecture](a ) using a ray picture @xcite .    .",
    "the outcoupling at the grating structure is a constructive interference if all grating parameter are designed properly , hence , providing @xmath13 reflectivity .",
    "( b ) equivalent waveguide grating architecture realized in this work , including an al@xmath5o@xmath6 layer as etch stop in order to define the grating depth in the fabrication process.,width=453 ]    it follows the idea of having a single nanostructured layer with high index of refraction @xmath14 on a substrate having a lower index of refraction of @xmath15 .",
    "incident light of wavelength @xmath16 can then be resonantly enhanced for subwavelength grating structures if the grating parameters , namely the grating period @xmath17 , waveguide layer thickness @xmath18 , grating depth @xmath19 and fill factor @xmath20 ( ratio of ridge width @xmath21 and grating period @xmath17 ) , are designed properly . from the grating equation",
    "one can derive a lower boundary for the grating period that permits the propagation of first diffraction orders in the waveguide layer and an upper boundary that allows guidance of light due to total internal reflection at the interface of high and low index of refraction materials @xcite . the same boundaries simultaneously prohibit higher diffraction orders in air ( @xmath22 ) and the waveguide layer ( @xmath23 ) . as a result",
    ", the grating period @xmath17 is restricted to a range of @xmath24 for tantala ( ta@xmath5o@xmath25 ) with @xmath26 and fused silica ( sio@xmath5 ) with @xmath27 at a wavelength of @xmath28 nm .",
    "this restriction is illustrated in fig .",

    "( b ) if an etch stop layer with index of refraction @xmath31 is implemented , coupling into the waveguide occurs for @xmath32 independent of its thickness @xmath33.,width=453 ]    for the waveguide grating described in this article , we have implemented an additional thin layer of al@xmath5o@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : architecture](b ) ) , which was used as an etch stop ( there is a high contrast of etching rates between al@xmath5o@xmath6 and ta@xmath5o@xmath25 ) to define a particular grating depth in the fabrication process .",
    "its index of refraction of @xmath31 is high enough to allow first order coupling to the waveguide layer if @xmath32 holds for the grating period independent of the etch stop layer thickness @xmath33 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gratingperiod](b ) ) . in particular for a thickness of only a few nanometers there is no significant influence on the coupling efficiency and consequently the waveguide grating s optical properties in comparison with the conventional design ( @xmath34 nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : gratingperiod](b ) ) .",
    "the starting point for the fabrication was a standard @xmath35inch fused silica mask blank coated by a layer system of tantala ( @xmath36 nm ) , al@xmath5o@xmath6 ( @xmath37 nm ) and tantala ( @xmath29 nm ) .",
    "a top chromium ( cr ) layer of @xmath38 nm thickness was attached onto the layer system , serving as the mask during tantala etching .",
    "this mask was realized by spin coating the whole sample with an electron beam sensitive resist and applying electron beam lithography for an area of @xmath39 mm aiming at a grating period of @xmath40 nm , which satisfies @xmath41 , and a fill factor of about @xmath42 . after",
    "resist development the chromium layer was structured by utilizing an inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) dry - etching process .",
    "finally the binary chromium mask was transferred only into the upper tantala layer by means of an anisotropic reactive ion beam etching ( ribe ) process supported by the high etching contrast between tantala and al@xmath5o@xmath6 . a scanning electron microscope ( sem )",
    "cross - sectional image of a fabricated structure from this process is shown in fig .",

    "this image also shows the residual chromium mask , which was removed prior to sample application .    corresponding to the values for the grating parameters given in fig .",
    "[ fig : semdesign](a ) , rcwa was used to predict the reflectivity for te - polarized light and a fill factor of @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : semdesign](b ) ) .",
    "these results indicate that reflectivities higher @xmath45 are feasible , within parameter uncertainties of a few nanometers that are difficult to resolve on the basis of the sem image .",
    "the most crucial parameter here is the tantala layer thickness @xmath18 . a variation of this layer thickness by @xmath46 nm leads to an absolute decrease in reflectivity of @xmath47 , since the area of high reflectivity in fig .",
    "[ fig : semdesign](b ) shifts to larger grating periods with smaller waveguide layer thickness ( not shown here ) .    we would like to note , that the etch stop layer design in principle offers the possibility to reduce the grating depth @xmath19 of an already fabricated grating sample without affecting the other parameters by means of an additional etching step , which has not been done yet for our investigated device . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : semdesign](b ) this could efficiently be used in conjunction with a slightly smaller grating period ( or in case of a tantala layer thickness @xmath48 nm ) , which enables to cross the area of high reflectivity with decreasing grating depth .",

    "fig : jif](b ) ) based on the geo600 suspension design @xcite . while the end mirror was a conventional multilayer mirror with a nominal power reflectivity of @xmath50 the coupling to the cavity was realized with the waveguide grating mirror having an area of @xmath39 mm ( see fig .  [",

    "their separation was @xmath51 m , yielding a free spectral range of @xmath52mhz with @xmath53 being the speed of light .",
    "the radius of curvature of the end mirror ( @xmath54 m ) defines the beam waist diameter on the plane waveguide grating to be @xmath55 mm , which is at least three times smaller than the grating .",
    "therefore , we assume any power losses from beam clipping to be negligible .    for all measurements the vacuum system had been evacuated to @xmath56 mbar in order to suppress acoustic noise and residual gas pressure noise .",
    "the cavity could be stabilized on resonance using the pound - drever - hall scheme @xcite .",
