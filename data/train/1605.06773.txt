    "electronic structure theory aims at providing accurate properties of molecules in their electronic ground and excited states .",
    "however , systematically improvable wave function methods are often computationally expensive and can even become unfeasible .",
    "this dilemma is particularly pressing for systems with strong static electron correlation , i.e. , for those with dense one - electron states around the fermi energy level showing a small gap .",
    "for such cases , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite has evolved as a powerful alternative to exact diagonalization techniques such as complete active space self - consistent field ( cas - scf ) approaches@xcite .",
    "the success of dmrg is due to a polynomial scaling of the computational cost with respect to an increasing number of active orbitals , in contrast to the exponential scaling@xcite of cas - based approaches .",
    "it was shown by stlund and rommer@xcite that the dmrg optimizes matrix product states ( mps )  one - dimensional chains of tensors that are a consequence of the algorithm which imposes a one - dimensional ordering of the molecular orbitals in the construction process of the total basis states .",
    "in contrast to one - dimensional spin chains in solid - state physics , molecular systems governed by the full coulomb interaction in general feature multidimensional entanglement for which the linear mps ansatz is not well suited . this in turn may lead to convergence problems .",
    "still , the dmrg optimization of mpss can be beneficial for strongly correlated molecules if other approaches are unfeasible as we pointed out for transition metal complexes@xcite .",
    "moreover , dynamic correlation effects have to be considered  either a posteriori by perturbation theory@xcite or from the outset by , for example , short",
    " range dft@xcite",
    ".    one can overcome the problem of complex , multidimensional entanglement patterns by generalizing the mps ansatz ( see ref .",
    "for a discussion in the context of electronic structure theory ) . in the field of solid - state physics , the tensor product variational approach ( tpva)@xcite , string bond states ( sbs)@xcite , projected entangled pair states ( peps)@xcite , multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera)@xcite , entangled plaquette states@xcite ( eps ) , and correlator product states ( cps)@xcite attempt to generalize the mps ansatz and describe multidimensional entanglement .",
    "these approaches constitute a new family of states called tensor network states ( tns ) .",
    "complete - graph tensor network states ( cgtns)@xcite were the first tns application in quantum chemistry employing the full electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the complexity of the high - dimensional coefficient tensor was reduced by breaking it down into a complete - graph tensor network , in which all spin orbitals are connected with each other by 2-site correlators .",
    "the number of variational parameters is explicitly defined by the number of spin orbital pairs , which limits the variational freedom of the cgtns ansatz for large active spaces .",
    "another tns approach explored in the field of quantum chemistry are tree tensor network states ( ttnss)@xcite .",
    "while representing an interesting class of quantum states , the optimization of ttns parameters can be cumbersome and non - competitive when compared to efficient traditional quantum chemical methods . in 2013 ,",
    "nakatani and chan proposed a ttns variant for the full electronic hamiltonian@xcite that overcomes this problem .",
    "tensors are connected as defined by a tree graph in ttns , which attempt to map the molecular structure .",
    "due to the absence of loops in their ttns ansatz , nakatani and chan could apply the dmrg optimization algorithm .",
    "the mps ansatz is computationally very efficient , but truly reliable only for encoding a sequential entanglement structure .",
    "the ttns scheme provides a more general description of entanglement which is , in the nakatani  chan formulation , of similar computational efficiency as mps - dmrg , but it still imposes restrictions on the entanglement structure .",
    "cgtns , in principle , does not restrict the entanglement pattern and works as well for multidimensional entanglement as it does for one - dimensional entanglement .",
    "however , the optimization of 2-site correlators is difficult as an efficient global and local optimization strategy is required .",
    "it is desirable to have an ansatz which adjusts the number of variational parameters to the system under study .",
    "therefore , here we propose the concept of a cgtns ansatz that starts from 2-site correlators and gradually include higher - order correlators .",
    "we then explore different optimization strategies to assess its potential for actual applications in molecular physics and chemistry .",

    "since the number of slater determinants that can be generated by distributing @xmath2 electrons among @xmath8 spin orbitals scales exponentially@xcite , the @xmath13 can be found only for systems of limited size of up to about 18 electrons in 18 spatial orbitals .",
    "hence , approximations are desirable for approaching the fci solution in a given orbital space with more orbitals and electrons .",

    "this would introduce two additional electrons and six additional orbitals into active space .",

    "the cas - scf(9,12 ) energy difference of -40.59 kcal / mol , deviates from the experimental value of 3.58 kcal / mol because of the lack of dynamic electron correlation .",

    "note that these schemes enlarge the variational space for the sextet to the same extent as their hybrid analogs .",
    "in this paper , we presented a rigorous analysis of various @xmath128-site correlators schemes for tensor network states at the example of manganocene .",
    "we demonstrated that the 2-site correlator cgtns scheme achieves an efficient parameter reduction for the systems with a configurational space spanned by about 15 000 onvs . in the case of the sextet state of manganocene ,",
    "the number of variational parameters is reduced by 91% without significant loss of accuracy ; the error is about 15.5 mhartree .",
    "introducing higher - order correlators increases the accuracy and delivers results closer to the cas - scf reference results .",
    "this , however , comes with an unreasonable inflation of the parameter space .",
    "we suggested and analyzed two different strategies for the introduction of higher - order correlators .",
    "the first one assumes that the ansatz features only 3-site correlators and optimizes the energy with respect to them alone .",
    "the second strategy incorporates 3-site correlators into a converged 2-site correlator ansatz .",
    "we demonstrated that such a hybrid extension of a 2-site correlator ansatz converges better and faster than the optimization of only 3-site correlators .",
    "the 3-site correlator cgtns parameterizations are accurate for the description of a configurational space of about 100 000 onvs .",
    "one can avoid inflation of the variational space by considering 3-site correlators only for the most entangled spin orbitals .",
    "such a restriction has only a slight affect on accuracy with respect to the original ansatz ; in addition , it also increases energy convergence in the monte carlo optimization .",
    "our results for the doublet state of manganocene showed that a reduction of the variational space by 80% , 85% , 91% , and 99% leads to errors of only -19.766 mhartree , -21.41 mhartree , 23.174 mhartree , and -40.256 mhartree , respectively .",
    "therefore , only an adaptive cgtns ansatz is promising that introduces higher - order correlators selectively on demand . with the energy measures introduced for accuracy control such an ansatz can adapt to the electronic structure under the study .",
    "a reduction of variational space by 85% to 90% leads to a 20 mhartree error for total electronic energies .",
    "however , for most chemical processes , the evaluation of energy _ differences _ is most important .",
    "we found that reliable results can be obtained if the same reduction of variational parameters for the two energies to be compared is achieved .",
    "for the manganocene sextet  doublet energy difference , the error introduced by tensor network parameterizations can be reduced to only 8.5% of the reference value .    while the non - stochastic optimization schemes performed well for the cps ansatz , for cgtns they turned out to be inefficient .",
    "hence , additional work on the improvement of our monte carlo optimization scheme is required .",
