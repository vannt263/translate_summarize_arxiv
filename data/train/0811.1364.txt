    "experiments at lep , slc and tevatron have provided a large number of high - precision data , which , being supplemented by detailed studies of higher - order corrections , allow to probe the standard model at the loop level and subsequently to predict the mass of the higgs boson . in this context , the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle , @xmath3 , plays the most crucial role .",
    "it can be defined through the effective vector and axial - vector couplings , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of the @xmath6 boson to leptons ( @xmath7 ) at the @xmath6-boson pole , @xmath8 the effective weak - mixing angle can be related to the on - shell weinberg angle , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at tree level , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the form factor",
    "@xmath15 incorporates the higher - order loop corrections .",
    "usually , the @xmath16-boson mass , @xmath17 , is not treated as an input parameter but it is calculated from the fermi constant , @xmath18 , which is precisely known from the muon lifetime . the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be cast in the form @xmath19 where the quantity @xmath20 @xcite contains all higher - order corrections .",
    "the presently most accurate calculation of the @xmath16-boson mass includes full two - loop and leading higher - order corrections @xcite . on the other hand , the quantity @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) incorporates all corrections to the form factors of the @xmath22 vertex .",
    "recently , the calculation of the two - loop electroweak corrections has been completed @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath3 due to unknown higher orders has been estimated to be 0.000047 , which is substantially smaller than the error of the current experimental value @xmath23 @xcite , but still larger than the expected precision , @xmath24 , of a future high - luminosity linear collider running at the @xmath6-boson pole @xcite .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath3 is determined from six asymmetry measurements , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . of those ,",
    "the average leptonic and hadronic measurements differ by 3.2 standard deviations , which is one of the largest discrepancies within the standard model .",
    "the main impact stems from two measurements , the left - right asymmetry with a polarised electron beam at sld , @xmath31 , and the forward - backward asymmetry for bottom quarks at lep , @xmath28 . on the experimental side ,",
    "the only possible source of this discrepancy are uncertainties in external input parameters , in particular parameters describing the production and decay of heavy - flavoured hadrons ; see section 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion .",
    "however , the interpretation of the asymmetry measurements in terms of @xmath3 requires also some theoretical input .",
    "the leptonic asymmetries depend on lepton couplings only and can be translated straightforwardly into the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle , with small corrections due to @xmath32- and @xmath33-channel photon exchange . by contrast , the hadronic observables , @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 , depend on the quark couplings , @xmath34 .",
    "these couplings are associated with a flavour - dependent hadronic effective weak - mixing angle , @xmath35 , @xmath36 the forward - backward pole asymmetry of a quark @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is related to the effective couplings , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the effective weak - mixing angle , @xmath35 , by vertex also has a scalar part , besides the vector and axial - vector parts .",
    "we checked explicitly that the contribution of this scalar form factor to @xmath28 is more than a factor 1000 smaller than the current experimental uncertainty and thus truly negligible . ]",
    "@xmath41 with @xmath42 at tree level , @xmath35 and @xmath3 are identical , but the relations between these quantities receive sizable radiative corrections that need to be included in the analysis . note that , due to the small electric charge of the bottom quark , @xmath43 , the parameter @xmath44 is close to 1 , and @xmath28 is only weakly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the discrepancy between @xmath45 and @xmath28 could be explained by radiative corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical prediction for @xmath0 enters in the standard - model fits through several observables , so that a precise prediction of this quantity is important for a robust analysis .    for all fermions except bottom quarks , the known radiative corrections to @xmath46 include at least two - loop fermionic electroweak contributions and some leading higher - order corrections ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "however , for the @xmath47 vertex only one - loop corrections , leading two - loop corrections for large values of the top - quark mass of @xmath48 , and two- and three - loop qcd corrections have been calculated @xcite and included in the zfitter program @xcite ( see also the new program gfitter @xcite ) , which is widely used for global standard - model fits . the remaining two - loop electroweak corrections beyond the @xmath49 contributions are still unknown , although they are expected to be larger than the @xmath48 term , based on experience from @xmath3 . as a result , the present treatment of higher - order electroweak corrections leads to inconsistencies , for example in @xmath28 , since the corrections to @xmath3 and @xmath50 include two - loop and leading three - loop corrections that are absent for @xmath0 and @xmath44 ( see recent discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper , the part of the missing two - loop corrections to @xmath0 with closed fermion loops is presented .",
    "we begin by explaining the techniques employed for the calculation in the next section . in section  [ results ] , numerical results for @xmath0 are given before the summary in section  [ concl ] .",
    "we work in the standard model and adopt the on - shell renormalisation scheme , which relates the renormalised masses and couplings to physical observables .",
    "details on the renormalisation scheme and explicit expressions for the relevant counterterms can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the loop integrations , we employ dimensional regularisation .",
    "the problem of @xmath51 matrices in two - loop vertex diagrams with fermion triangle sub - loops is treated in the same way as in refs .",
    "@xcite , by evaluating the finite non - anticommutative contribution from @xmath51 to the vertex diagrams in four dimensions .",
    "most aspects connected with the calculation of the effective weak - mixing angle for the @xmath52 vertex are the same as for the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle and are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contributions for the two - loop renormalisation terms are identical to the case of @xmath3 , with the exception of the two - loop bottom - quark wave - function counterterm , which involves new self - energy diagrams with internal top - quark propagators ; the first terms of this quantity are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the two - loop @xmath47 vertex corrections , on the other hand ,",
    "a number of new three - point diagrams need to be computed . in general ,",
    "electroweak two - loop corrections can be divided into two groups , which are separately finite and gauge invariant : fermionic corrections ( with at least one closed fermion loop ) and bosonic corrections ( without any closed fermion loops ) . in this article , we focus on the fermionic diagrams as a first step .    for the purpose of this calculation , all light - quark masses are neglected in the two - loop diagrams , including the bottom - quark mass . as a result , for many diagrams ,",
    "known results from the @xmath3 calculation can be used @xcite .",
    "the loop integrals for diagrams with closed massless - fermion loops are given in analytical form , while large - mass expansions were employed for diagrams with top quarks in the loops .",
    "however , the two - loop corrections to @xmath0 include a new group of integrals that were not covered in previous calculations of @xmath3 , stemming from diagrams with internal @xmath16-boson and top - quark propagators ; see fig .",
    "[ diags ] .",
    "the computation of these diagrams will be discussed in detail in the following subsections .",
    "the two - loop diagrams are computed with several independent methods , so that cross checks can be performed .",
    "the first method , based on the observation that all new diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diags ] include internal top - quark propagators , uses asymptotic expansions for large top - quark mass .",
    "this method was already employed successfully for the calculation of @xmath3 @xcite . for references on the subject ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "secondly , we develop a code for the evaluation of feynman diagrams with a semi - numerical method , based on the bernstein - tkachov ( bt ) method of ref .",
    "this method had already been used previously for one - loop problems @xcite . in a recent series of papers @xcite",
    ", it was extended to general two - loop vertices , and some applications to two - loop problems are already known : the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and corrections to the @xmath53 decay width in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we use another semi - numerical method based on dispersion relations @xcite , which was also used previously for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to evaluate all self - energy diagrams , the vertex diagrams in figs .",
    "[ diags](a)(d ) , as well as the scalar integrals with the topology of figs .",
    "[ diags](e)(g ) . however , due to problems with the complex tensor structure , the complete diagrams in figs .",
    "[ diags](e)(g ) can not be checked with this technique .    in the next subsections , we explain the applications of these methods for our purposes and present a comparison between them .",
    "we perform an expansion in a parameter @xmath54 , where @xmath55 for any two - loop problem , there are four regions to consider .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the internal momenta in the loops and @xmath58 stand for any external momentum , while @xmath59 generically denotes all masses that are small compared to @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in our case , @xmath62 .",
    "then the four regions can be identified as follows :    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< \" , ]     following earlier publications on two - loop electroweak corrections , we express our results in terms of fitting formulas .",
    "the form factor @xmath63 , which contains the fermionic two - loop electroweak corrections to @xmath0 according to eq .",
    ", can be approximated as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the one - loop result , and @xmath66   \\delta_z & = \\frac{m_z}{91.1876~\\mathrm{gev } } -1 , & \\delta_w & = \\frac{m_w}{80.404~\\mathrm{gev } } -1 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fitting this formula to the exact result , we obtain @xmath67 this parametrisation reproduces the exact calculation with maximal and average deviations of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , as long as the input parameters stay within their @xmath70 ranges of the experimental errors quoted in table  [ tab : input ] and the higgs - boson mass is in the range 10  gev @xmath71 1  tev . if the top - quark mass and the @xmath16-boson mass vary within 4@xmath72 ranges , the formula is still accurate to @xmath73 .",
    "we also present a simple parametrisation for the currently best prediction for @xmath0 , including all known corrections to @xmath74 and @xmath20 ( for the calculation of @xmath17 from @xmath18 see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath74 , in addition to the one - loop and fermionic two - loop electroweak corrections , we include qcd corrections of @xmath75 @xcite and @xmath76 @xcite to the one - loop contribution , as well as universal corrections for large top - quark mass , of @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "moreover , leading four - loop qcd correction to the @xmath79 parameter , which arise from top- and bottom - quark loops , are taken into account @xcite .",
    "we use the parametrisation @xmath80 with @xmath81 the best - fit numerical values for the coefficients are @xmath82 this parametrisation approximates the full result with maximal and average deviations of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , for 10  gev@xmath85  tev and the other input parameters in their @xmath70 ranges .",
    "in this paper , the calculation of the two - loop electroweak fermionic corrections to the effective weak - mixing angle for the @xmath52 vertex , @xmath0 , was presented .",
    "such an accurate theoretical prediction for @xmath0 is necessary for the interpretation of the bottom - quark asymmetry measurements at the @xmath6-boson pole .",
    "compared to the previously known corrections to @xmath0 , the new electroweak two - loop result turns out to be sizable , of order @xmath86 for a higgs - boson mass near 100  gev .",
    "the calculation was performed by using methods that had been used earlier for the computation of the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle , as well as a newly developed code based on the bt algorithm .",
    "the results of the different methods were checked against each other .",
    "although we did not perform a detailed analysis of the error from unknown high - order corrections , in particular the missing bosonic two - loop corrections and terms of order @xmath87 , we expect those to be of similar order as for the leptonic effective weak - mixing angle .",
    "the main difference between the leptonic and bottom - quark effective weak - mixing angles are the vertex diagrams with internal @xmath16-boson and top - quark propagators .",
    "while leading to numerical differences between @xmath3 and @xmath0 , these diagrams do not introduce special enhancement or suppression factors .",
    "therefore , we expect the theoretical uncertainty to our result for @xmath0 to be about @xmath88 , similar to ref .  @xcite .",
