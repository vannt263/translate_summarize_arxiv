    "thus , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 then the averaging estimate ( [ ai ] ) holds . since @xmath27 and @xmath28 estimates are clearly possible , we see from the interpolation theorem that if @xmath29 then @xmath19",

    "+ on the other hand , if the optimal fourier decay estimate of the surface measure @xmath8 is given by @xmath36 then it is in general hard to prove sharp averaging results and some technical arguments are required to deal with the case ( see @xcite ) . in the finite field case ,",
    "this was also pointed out by the authors in @xcite . + as an analogue of euclidean averaging problems , carbery , stones , and wright @xcite initially introduced and studied the averaging problem in finite fields and the author with shen has recently investigated the averaging problem over homogeneous varieties . in this introduction , we shortly review notation and definitions for averaging problems in the finite field setting and readers are referred to @xcite for further information and motivation on the averaging problem .",

    "we endow the space @xmath37 with a normalized counting measure @xmath39 .",
