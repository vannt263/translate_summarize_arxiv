    "nucleus  nucleus collisions are considered as ultraperipheral collisions ( upcs ) , if the impact parameter @xmath4the distance between the centers of the colliding nuclei in the transverse plane of the reaction  is larger than the sum of the nuclear radii , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the nuclear radius ( for a review of the upc physics see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "hadron interactions are strongly suppressed in such collisions and , thus , experimentally the upc events are characterized by minimal multiplicity .",
    "this results in a relative enhancement of electromagnetic processes induced by the high flux of photons generated by ultrarelativistic nuclei which scales as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the charge of the nucleus .",
    "the photon virtuality is small and while its transverse momentum is @xmath9 , its longitudinal momentum is proportional to the large lorentz factor @xmath10 of the ion producing the photon flux . hence , one can apply the method of equivalent photons to express the cross section of @xmath0 production in nucleus ",

    "the presence of two terms in eq .",
    "( [ csupc ] ) is due to the symmetry of pbpb collisions : each nucleus can radiate a photon as well as serve as a target .",
    "the photon flux @xmath19 can be calculated with reasonable accuracy and , therefore , the upcs can be effectively used to study the energy behavior of the vector meson photoproduction cross section at high energies .",
    "high energy coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei is of a particular interest since the large @xmath20-quark mass , @xmath21 , provides a hard scale @xmath22 justifying the use of the factorization theorem of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "this allowed one to develop several models predicting the cross section of @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclear targets at high energies .",
    "unfortunately , until recently , the progress in experimental studies of this process was more than modest : about two dozens events have been accumulated in recent measurements of @xmath0 photoproduction in auau upcs at rhic at @xmath23 gev  @xcite .    in 2011 , the alice collaboration measured the yield of coherent @xmath0 photoproduction in pbpb upcs in the rapidity range of @xmath24 with the central barrel  @xcite and in the range of @xmath25 covered by the muon spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "this allowed one to obtain the cross section @xmath26 at two values of rapidity : @xmath27    these values of @xmath28 were compared @xcite to a number of predictions and appeared to be in a better agreement with those which calculated coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclear targets in the leading order ( lo ) pqcd taking into account the nuclear gluon shadowing  @xcite .",
    "however , it is reasonable to reduce as much as possible the model dependence in the comparisons of the experimental cross sections with different model calculations .",
    "we believe that the best strategy to achieve this goal is to analyze the alice results in terms of the nuclear suppression factor @xmath29 .",
    "we define @xmath29 through the ratio of the experimentally measured coherent photoproduction cross section at a given @xmath15 to the cross section calculated in the impulse approximation ( ia ) which neglects all nuclear effects except for coherence : @xmath30^{1/2 } \\ , .",

    "since the nucleus remains intact in the considered process , the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 is dictated by the elastic nuclear form factor @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the cross section in the impulse approximation can be written as : @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaia ] ) , @xmath34 is the forward differential cross section of @xmath35 which can be extracted from the experimental data  @xcite ; @xmath36 is defined as the integral over the nuclear form factor @xmath37 squared : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] is determined by the minimal longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath40 characterizing the coherence length which becomes important in the low energy domain . in the case of pb ,",
    "the nuclear form factor @xmath41 can be calculated with a small uncertainty since the nuclear density distribution @xmath42 is well known from the electron  lead and proton  lead elastic scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the suppression factor @xmath29 is practically model independent since the estimate of the cross section in the impulse approximation is based on experimental data .",
    "in this subsection , we determine the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction cross section @xmath43 from the values of @xmath28 measured by alice . in general , the extraction of @xmath43 is not straightforward due to the presence of two terms in eq .",
    "( [ csupc ] ) . however , this problem is not present at @xmath44 since the energies of the photons emitted by both colliding ions are equal in this case .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath45    on the other hand , at forward rapidity @xmath46 , there are low - energy and high - energy contributions .",
    "calculations predict the strong dominance of the low - energy contribution ( more than @xmath47 ) in eq .",
    "( [ csupc ] ) due to a steep falloff of the photon flux for high photon energies .",
    "therefore , in this case we obtain : @xmath48 which is valid with a 5% error that is well below the experimental uncertainties .",
    "next we need to calculate the photon flux @xmath49 produced by pb nuclei with the energy of 1.38 @xmath50tev .",
    "experimentally , coherent @xmath0 events are selected by requiring only two daughter leptons and the otherwise empty detector .",
    "this means that the strong interactions between colliding nuclei should be suppressed and , hence , the impact parameter is required to be larger than the sum of the nuclear radii : @xmath51 .",
    "actually , the sharp cutoff at @xmath52 can be improved by using a more accurate approximation in the calculation of the strong interaction suppression . indeed , using the profile factor @xmath53 where @xmath54 mb is the total nucleon ",

    "the suppression factor @xmath29 that we extracted from the alice data can be compared to theoretical predictions for @xmath29 made in different models and approaches .",

    "a high energy photon converts into a vector meson at a long distance ( time ) before the target .",
    "then , the vector meson interacts coherently with the nucleus by means of multiple interactions with the target nucleons .",

    "the application of the vmd approach is problematic because the standard vmd model does not take into account that the space  time picture of production of heavy onium states involves three stages : the production of `` frozen '' small - size @xmath94 configurations , their interaction with the target , and the conversion of @xmath94 into the final - state onium .",
    "this space  time picture can be modeled using the color dipole framework to calculate the cross section of the interaction of the @xmath95 configuration with the nucleon and the glauber theory ( eikonal model ) to describe the propagation of the dipoles of the fixed transverse size through the nuclear medium .",

    "a good agreement is observed for the central set of the eps09lo nuclear gluon shadowing factor ( blue solid line ) .",

    "it is worth noting here that the main problem in the determination of the nuclear gluon shadowing at @xmath138 in the global qcd fit analyses is the lack of high quality data sensitive to the nuclear gluon pdfs not only at these values of @xmath102 , but also at larger @xmath139 . as a result , in these fits , almost any values of @xmath140 between 0 and 1",
    "are allowed leading to strong differences between different analyses .",

    "in particular , in addition to the dis and dy data , the eps08 analysis included in their fit the brahms data  @xcite on forward high @xmath141 pion production in da collisions at rhic assuming that the nuclear modification of the pion yield in this kinematics is due to the gluon shadowing .",
    "this resulted in a very strong effect of nuclear gluon shadowing .",
    "however , already in the eps09 analysis , this data was excluded from the fit since it was difficult to separate the gluon shadowing from other pqcd mechanisms also leading to the suppression of the yield of forward high @xmath141 pions . instead",
    ", the data on inclusive neutral pion production in da collisions from phenix  @xcite was added to the dis and dy data sets in the eps09 analysis leading to the nuclear shadowing effect which is weaker than that in eps08 , but still stronger than in hkn07 and nds .",

    "however , one has to keep in mind that a strong increase of @xmath136 ( small gluon shadowing ) is disfavored by the comparison with the alice suppression factors .    in summary",
    ", our analysis shows that the bulk of the nuclear suppression found in the alice measurements of @xmath0 photoproduction in upcs of heavy ions at the lhc energies is due to the nuclear gluon shadowing .",
    "moreover , it seems that a reasonable agreement between the measured nuclear suppression factor with the predictions of nuclear gluon shadowing in the leading twist approximation can be considered as evidence of the adequate description of this phenomenon in the leading twist framework .",
    "the analysis of the alice measurements of exclusive @xmath0 production in ultraperipheral pbpb collisions at 2.76 tev demonstrates that this data provides the experimental evidence for a comparatively large nuclear suppression in pb at small @xmath138 .",
