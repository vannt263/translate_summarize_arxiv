    "whether gravitational collapse results in a black hole or a naked singularity is one of the crucial issues in classical general relativity .",
    "a singularity is not a  _ point _ \" in the spacetime and information from such a place is in fact an end of causality in the theory . in order to avoid such a breakdown of physics",
    ", it is often believed that naked singularities can not be formed under physically reasonable conditions in classical general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this is known as the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) @xcite .",
    "broadly there are two versions of the ccc , i.e. , a strong cosmic censorship conjecture ( sccc ) and a weak cosmic censorship conjecture ( wccc ) .",
    "the sccc prohibits the formation of locally naked singularity , i.e. , singularities are not visible to even nearby observers . on the other hand ,",
    "the wccc prohibits the formation of globally naked singularity , allowing a local observer moving around singularity to see it .",
    "though there have been many efforts to prove the ccc , it remains as one of the important unsolved problem in gr .",
    "meanwhile , a considerable number of counterexamples have been found violating both the wccc and sccc .    in 1939",
    "oppenheimer and snyder studied the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous dust cloud and found that the collapse ends in a black hole @xcite .",
    "however , in absence of a general proof of the ccc there have been studies on collapse using various matter models like dust , radiation , scalar fields , and so on . in these exact solutions of einstein equations several counterexamples to the ccc have been found .",
    "for example , naked singularities form in the collapse of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust models @xcite ( see ref . @xcite and the references therein ) . in general",
    "there are two types of singularities in spherical collapse , namely , shell - crossing and shell - focusing singularities .",
    "but , in what follows , we will focus only on the central shell - focusing singularities .",
    "recently , higher - dimensional spacetimes have generated considerable interest in theoretical physics .",
    "these higher - dimensional models are motivated by string / m theory .",
    "the case of collapse of a inhomogeneous dust cloud in the simple extension of gr to higher dimensions was well studied .",
    "it was shown there that the singularity can not be naked when the spacetime dimension is more than six for smooth initial data @xcite ( see also ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "more precisely , one could confirm that the sccc holds in dimensions higher than six in such a naive extension of gr to higher dimensions .",
    "clearly , the spacetime dimensions play an important role in the final fate of the gravitational collapse . however , it is expected that spacetime should be extremely curved near singularities putting in doubt the validity of classical gr in these regions .",
    "indeed the string / m theory predicts the higher curvature corrections to the einstein equation in its low - energy limit . in view of the above facts it is important to study gravitational collapse in such a theory .",
    "though the ccc was originally formulated for general relativity , it is worthwhile to investigate the implications of stringy effects on it . in this paper",
    ", we shall address this issue while focusing on the gravitational collapse of spherical symmetric dust clouds .",
    "but there is no canonical recipe to include higher - order curvature corrections to gr .",
    "although string theory predicts such corrections , we do not have a clear picture yet . in this paper",
    "we shall adopt a special combination of higher curvature corrections so that the field equations do not include the higher derivative terms of the metric than the third order , that is , the lovelock theory @xcite .",
    "there is no strong reason why the ccc should hold in the lovelock theory , since energy conditions are generally violated in this theory . nevertheless , if singularities do form in this theory , it is important to know their features .    in the lovelock theory",
    "the static black hole solutions of a spherically symmetric vacuum were found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref . @xcite the stability of a static vacuum black hole solution was discussed .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a spherical homogeneous dust cloud was analyzed in the dimensionally continued gravity @xcite(the restricted class of the lovelock theory @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown there that the singularity will be covered by event horizon as in the oppenheimer - snyder s case @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the gravitational spherical collapse of inhomogeneous dust cloud in the gauss - bonnet theory of gravity was addressed in ref . @xcite and it was shown that the final fate of collapse depends on the dimensions of spacetime . an exact solution and",
    "complete analysis in the 5-d gauss - bonnet theory was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in five dimensions ,",
    "singularities were found to be naked and massive . from six to nine dimensions , singularities are naked and massless . in dimensions",
    "higher than ten , singularities are always covered .",
    "therefore , including the gauss - bonnet corrections to gr makes the final state of collapse rather nontrivial .",
    "the gravitational collapse of null dust fluid was also studied @xcite .",
    "these works also showed that the lovelock corrections modify the collapse scenario in a nontrivial way .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the gravitational collapse of a spherical inhomogeneous dust cloud in the lovelock gravity , without cosmological constant and in any dimensions .",
    "we show that singularities do form in the final stage of gravitational collapse in general and that they could be naked for some initial dates . comparing with the gauss - bonnet gravity",
    ", we found that the lovelock term changes the nature of singularities . in the gauss - bonnet case , singularities which appear in more than six dimensions",
    "are massless . in the lovelock theory with odd dimensions",
    ", we see that singularities are massive . on the other hand ,",
    "singularities are massless in the even dimensions .",
    "this is an unique feature of the lovelock gravity .",

    "in this section we give an overview of the lovelock theory in @xmath4-dimensional spacetimes .",

    "( [ geoevenc ] ) implies @xmath218 thus , near singularity , we have @xmath219 in the even - dimensional cases , @xmath201 diverges at @xmath85 and its behavior depends on the dimensions .",
    "this feature is different from odd - dimensional cases .",
    "in this paper we considered gravitational collapse of a spherical inhomogeneous dust cloud in the lovelock gravity with any dimension .",
    "we found that the formation of apparent horizon depends on the dimensions , that is , if it is odd or even . in even dimensions , noncentral singularities ( @xmath220 will be safely wrapped by apparent horizons and only  central \" singularities at @xmath85 could be naked . in odd dimensions , on the other hand , even those singularities which form at @xmath131",
    "may not be wrapped by apparent horizons and they could be naked .",
    "we also studied the future - directed outgoing null geodesics from singularities .",
    "then we showed the existence of radial null geodesics from singularities in odd and even dimensions separately .",
    "this is a clear violation of cosmic censorship conjecture ( at least the strong version ) . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", singularities can not be naked in more than six - dimensional spacetime in the naive dimensional extension of the einstein gravity .",
    "therefore the lovelock corrections worsen the situation in the aspect of the ccc .",
    "these results coincide with those of the spherical collapse of inhomogeneous dust in the gauss - bonnet theory , which is special case of the lovelock theory , and the null dust collapse in the lovelock theory .    compared with the gauss - bonnet gravity",
    ", we found that the lovelock term changes the nature of singularities more drastically . in the gauss - bonnet case , only massless naked singularities could form in more than six dimensions . however , we found that massive naked singularities can form in all odd dimensions in the lovelock gravity .",
    "we also examined the strength of the singularities and found that @xmath221 , with the null tangent @xmath222 , diverges at the singularities for all cases considered here .",
    "we also showed that the behavior of divergence depends on the spacetime dimensions in even dimension .",
    "however , it does not depend on the spacetime dimensions in the odd case .",
    "it is a characteristic feature of the lovelock gravity .    in this paper we had several assumptions which should be relaxed in future studies .",
    "first of all , we focused on the marginally bound cases with @xmath95 .",
    "but , our analysis can be easily extended to the nonmarginally bound cases @xmath223 .",
    "we assumed that the matter is a dust cloud . from the standpoint of the ccc ,",
    "we should deal with more generic matter fields .",
    "we also assumed here spherical symmetry . finally , most of our work is just the local analysis of singularity .",
    "the global visibility of singularity is still unclear .",
    "these are some of the remaining issues which will be hopefully addressed in the near future .",
