    "mutually unbiased basis sets are known to provide an optimal basis for quantum tomography @xcite , to play key roles in quantum cryptography @xcite , and to be instrumental in solving the mean king problem in prime power dimensions @xcite .",
    "the generalized pauli operators associated with mub s include the stabilizers of quantum error correcting codes @xcite , and serve as entanglement witnesses @xcite for the mub states . of interest for the foundations of quantum physics , the mub concept sharpens the concept of complementarity @xcite , and raises the question of existence in composite dimensions .",
    "an excellent comprehensive review of mubs has recently appeared @xcite .",
    "we deal here with hilbert spaces of prime power dimensions ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 mubs are known to exist @xcite .",
    "this is both the largest possible number , and also the number required for a complete operator basis ( in representing the density matrix , for example ) .",
    "so , while each mub is a complete orthonormal basis in the hilbert space , the set of @xmath10 mubs is a complete ( nonorthogonal ) basis in the space of all operators , which has dimension @xmath11 . regarding terminology , to avoid reference to a `` complete set of complete sets , '' and prompted by the fact that different mubs ( or the observable sets associated with them ) are maximally complementary @xcite",
    ", i will use the term `` full complement , '' or sometimes just `` complement , '' to denote the set of all @xmath10 mubs .",
    "partial mub sets have been discussed in connection with composite dimensions and referred to as `` constellations '' @xcite .",
    "the natural systems to which mubs apply consist of @xmath1 @xmath4-state objects ( _ qupits _ ) . in such systems , while mub complements exhibit only a single entanglement type for @xmath12 ( and all @xmath4 ) , the number of distinct types proliferates with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the variety is illustrated in a number of recent discussions , mostly on multiple qubit systems but also multiple qutrit systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , a systematic study by romero and collaborators @xcite illustrates a broad range of entanglement patterns that occur naturally in a construction scheme for full mub complements .",
    "such complements are catalogued for up to 4 qubits .",
    "wieniak and collaborators @xcite have developed a construction scheme aimed at experimental implementation and discussed the total entanglement content of full mub complements of bipartite systems .    with the general mub problem in mind ,",
    "our purpose here is to develop a general framework , independent of construction schemes , for exploring mub entanglement patterns for all @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "the project begins by proving three general theorems ( the `` rules '' ) that underlie and lead quickly to an array of more specific results .",
    "many of the latter apply to all @xmath4 , but are @xmath1-specific , as each step in @xmath1 introduces further richness .",
    "all results refer to one of two levels - that of individual mubs and that of full complements . at the individual level",
    ", mub types are characterized by first specifying the _ separation pattern _ - how many , and how big , are the irreducible subsets of qupits defined by the factorization of the wavefunction ? - and next , by describing the _ entanglement pattern _ - what is the nature of the entanglement within each irreducible subset ? at the level of the full complement , we ask about the possible _ mub distributions _ - what combinations of mub types can coexist within full complements . at the first level",
    ", we will show that all conceivable separation patterns are possible , and we will show with examples how to describe the entanglement within the nonseparable factors . at the level of the full complement , we will show how to deduce constraints on the possible mub distributions . for @xmath12 and 3 ,",
    "surprisingly , the general global constraints mentioned in the abstract suffice to determine all mub distributions for all @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath6 case is considerably more complex and requires the derivation of more detailed constraint equations .",
    "let us begin with a review of basic concepts and notation in section ii . in section iii",
    "we prove the three general theorems .",
    "these rules are applied in section iv to obtain the entanglement patterns of individual mubs , and to deduce constraints on their possible distributions within full complements , taking the @xmath12 - 4 cases in turn . in section",
    "v we summarize results and comment on unresolved questions .",
    "in hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath13 , two orthonormal bases ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are mutually unbiased if any state @xmath16 in basis @xmath14 has uniform probably of being found in any state @xmath17 in basis @xmath15 ; that is , if ||^2 = 1/d .",
    "[ mub ] thus , measurements in the two bases provide no redundant information .",
    "since measurements in any basis provide @xmath18 independent probabilities , and since @xmath19 real parameters are needed to determine an unknown quantum state ( its density matrix @xmath20 ) , it follows that @xmath10 mub s are required . in this way the mub projectors form a complete nonorthogonal basis in operator space",
    "this required number of mubs is ( only ) known to exist in power - of - prime dimensions .",
    "there is an intimate connection between mubs and generalized pauli operators ( hereafter called simply `` pauli operators '' ) which underlies several construction schemes ( provides a comprehensive listing @xcite ) .",
    "these operators are conventionally written in the form of a tensor product , _",
    "n , m = x^nz^m x_1^n_1x_2^n_2 ... x_n^n_nz_1^m_1 ... z_n^m_n , [ pauli1 ] whose factors , acting on individual qupits , are powers of the generalized ( @xmath21 ) pauli matrices , z = _",
    "k=0^p-1 ^k 1truecm 1truecm x = _ k=0^p-1 , [ pauli2 ] where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the raising operator of @xmath24 . the powers @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath4-nary numbers , _ eg _ , @xmath27 , whose digits take the values 0,1, ... ,@xmath28 . thus , there are @xmath29 operators @xmath30 ( including the identity @xmath31 ) , which make up a complete and orthonormal basis in operator space ( with the trace operation as inner product ) .",
    "the desired connection with mub s is described in : the @xmath30 partition into @xmath2 internally - commuting subsets , each consisting of @xmath28 traceless operators ( excluding @xmath32 ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenbases then form a complete complement of mub s .",
    "the above are standard definitions and conventions",
    ". it will be useful to adopt a couple of more special conventions for use throughout this paper .",
    "first , the operator set @xmath30 does not form a group , because multiplication generates irreducible phase factors . however , for odd @xmath4 the set @xmath33 does form a group , of order @xmath34 , and for @xmath7 the analogous set @xmath35 forms a group of order @xmath36 .",
    "these are called discrete heisenberg - weyl , or generalized pauli groups @xcite .",
    "we shall not make direct use of them , but we shall take advantage of the freedom to redefine the phases of the @xmath30 in the original set : we choose phases so that the compatible subsets form groups , and we call these _ compatibility groups_. they are all isomorphic to those consisting of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , each of which is generated by the @xmath1 independent elements , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "thus , to construct another compatibility group , we may choose a generator set @xmath41 that consists of any @xmath1 elements in the original compatible subset that do not form a subgroup , and write the resulting group elements as g^n g_1^n_1g_2^n_2 ... g_n^n_n .",
    "[ ggroup ] thus , all of the compatibility groups are representations of the same group - the abelian group of order @xmath42 generated by @xmath1 elements .",
    "a simple example of a compatibility group so generated is y^n = ( x_1z_1)^n_1(x_2z_2)^n_2 ... (x_nz_n)^n_n .",
    "[ ygroup ] note that phase factors are introduced with respect to the original pauli operators because , , @xmath43 .",
    "the generator set @xmath44 , by itself , completely determines the states of the basis ( @xmath44 ) in the hilbert space , through the eigenvalue equations @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a @xmath4-nary representation of the state index @xmath47 .",
    "the eigenvalues of a general group element are then given by g^n = ^n k , [ eigenvalues ] where @xmath48 , and the spectral representation of @xmath49 is therefore just the fourier transform @xcite g^n = _ k ^n k _ k ^n k ( g , k ) , [ specrep ] where @xmath50 is the projector onto state @xmath47 in basis @xmath44 .",
    "this mub projector is then given by the inverse transform , ( g , k ) = p^-n _ n ^-n k g^n .",
    "[ inverse ] the existence of these simple transform relationships between every compatibility group and its corresponding mub projector set is a consequence of defining the former to be a group .",
    "the only remaining arbitrary phases are those of the generators .",
    "in this section we establish the general rules that will form the basis for the rest of the work . for ease of reference and completeness i will state and prove these results as three separate numbered theorems . for transparency , here , in plain english , is what they will say about mub states : ( i ) a given qupit is perfectly pure or totally entangled , ( ii ) the distribution of one - qupit operator factors in the compatibility group correlates with this purity , ... , and ( iii ) in any full mub complement , every qupit appears pure @xmath2 times , and totally entangled @xmath3 times .",
    "these theorems and the results that follow from them rely on the assumption that mub states are eigenstates of pauli operators . while this is restrictive for individual mub pairs , it is not restrictive for known mub complements or known construction schemes @xcite , allowing for unitary equivalence .",
    "an example may help to illustrate .",
    "consider the standard basis in 4d , and another related to it by the unitary transformation @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 0,1,2,3 ) , which is not an eigenbasis of the pauli operators of .",
    "the two bases are mu , but a full complement can not be completed containing both of them",
    ". however , full complements can be found containing either basis without the other : starting with the well - known full complement containing the standard basis , one could apply @xmath53 to each of its bases to obtain another full complement .",
    "the latter are not eigenbases of the original pauli operators , but clearly they _ are _ eigenbases of transformed pauli operators , which may be thought of as corresponding to redefined parts ( and redefined quantization axes ) .",
    "the results of this paper then apply with reference to these redefined parts . regarding the existence of a mub complement outside of this",
    "equivalence - i believe that this question also remains unresolved @xcite .",
    "we will return to these points in the conclusions .    as a brief preliminary , one - qupit states within the @xmath1-qupit system are defined by the reduced density matrices , _",
    "i = , [ rhoi ] where tr@xmath54 denotes the partial trace over states of all but the @xmath55-th qupit .",
    "perfect purity means that @xmath56 is a projector , while total impurity means that @xmath57 .",
    "one can define the purity of the state @xmath58 as p_i = ( ptr _ i^2 - 1)/(p-1 ) , [ purity ] which takes its extremal values , 1 and 0 , in the respective cases .",
    "* theorem i : * if the system is in a pure eigenstate of pauli operators ( a generator set @xmath44 ) , then any individual qupit must exist in a state of either perfect purity , or total impurity , the same for all eigenstates of @xmath44 .    *",
    "proof : * the generators produce a compatibility group , and the @xmath1-qupit density matrix representing a pure eigenstate , @xmath59 , may be expanded as in .",
    "considering now the pauli matrix factors that act on just the @xmath55th qupit , the generator set @xmath44 must fall into one of two categories : only one pauli matrix , say @xmath60 ( and possibly powers of it ) , appears in the generator set , or more than one appear ( including , say , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , that are not powers of one another .",
    "consider the latter case , which is simpler : let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be generators that contain the factors @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "no operator of the form @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is any one - qupit pauli matrix ) commutes with both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and all such operators are thereby excluded from the compatibility group . as a result , the only operator with a nonvanishing partial trace tr@xmath54 is the global identity @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath32 enters the summation ( [ inverse ] ) with the coefficient @xmath67 , and tr@xmath54 produces a factor of @xmath68 , the reduced density matrix for the @xmath55th qupit is _",
    "i = p^-1  _ i , [ t1 ] indicating that the @xmath55th qupit is totally impure .",
    "now turn to the other case : if only @xmath60 ( and possibly powers ) appear in the generator set , then only @xmath60 and its powers can appear in the compatibility group ( again refering only to those factors that act on the @xmath55th qupit .",
    "since the `` one - body '' operators @xmath69 commute with all of these , they must belong to the compatibility group .",
    "these one - body operators are the only ones that survive the partial trace . since each of them enters the summation ( ) with coefficient @xmath70 , and",
    "since @xmath71 produces a factor of @xmath68 in each term , we find in this case that _",
    "i = p^-1 _ n ^- n_ik_i z_i^n_i = . [ t2 ] this shows that @xmath58 is a projector onto the eigenstate of @xmath60 whose eigenvalue is @xmath72 , that is , _",
    "i^2 = _ i 1.2truecm 1.2truecm z_i _ i = ^k_i _ i. [ t3 ] this proof is independent of the choice of the eigenstate @xmath73 ) in the basis @xmath44 , and so clearly the @xmath55th qubit is perfectly pure for all eigenstates in this basis .",
    "here is a related more detailed theorem on the distribution of one - qupit matrices associated with a single qupit .",
    "* theorem ii : * in any compatibility group of @xmath1-qupit pauli operators , the distribution of one - qupit factors acting on the @xmath55th qupit must be one of two types : ( i ) only a single pauli matrix and its powers occur , and each power occurs an equal number ( @xmath74 ) of times , or ( ii ) every pauli matrix occurs , and each occurs an equal number ( @xmath75 ) of times .    *",
    "proof : * consider any set @xmath44 of @xmath1 generators of the compatibility group .",
    "this set must be one of the two types considered in the foregoing proof : suppose first that only one pauli matrix ( say @xmath60 ) , and possibly powers of @xmath60 appear .",
    "let @xmath63 be a generator containing @xmath60 as a factor , and let @xmath64 , @xmath76 , ...",
    ", @xmath77 be the rest .",
    "@xmath63 by itself generates a cyclic subgroup containing all powers of @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath63 and @xmath64 by themselves generate a subgroup of order @xmath78 in which , by virtue of the rearrangement theorem , every power of @xmath60 appears @xmath4 times ( no matter which power of @xmath60 is present in @xmath64 ) .",
    "one may repeat this argument , multiplying the order of the subgroup by @xmath4 at each stage , until the full compatibility group is generated , with each power of @xmath60 being produced @xmath74 times .",
    "in the other case , let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be generators containing the @xmath61 and @xmath62 factors , respectively .",
    "these two generators , by themselves , generate a subgroup of order @xmath78 in which every pauli matrix factor @xmath66 appears once and only once .",
    "( to see this , note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , by themselves , generate the one - qupit pauli group @xcite , but since @xmath63 and @xmath64 commute , the multiplicity of phase factors is absent . )",
    "now , by including a third generator , @xmath76 , one generates a subgroup of order @xmath79 in which , by the rearrangement theorem , each pauli matrix factor appears @xmath4 times . repeating the process through @xmath77 , one generates the full compatibility group with each pauli matrix factor appearing @xmath75 times .",
    "the second result is particularly striking in light of the fact that the nature of the entanglement of the @xmath55th qupit may vary widely , in the sense that its entanglement may be shared with any number of other qupits in the system",
    ". nevertheless , only two kinds of pauli matrix distributions , with the correponding purities , are possible .",
    "we use both of the foregoing theorems to deduce the total entanglement content - as measured by the one - qupit purities - of a full complement of mub s . this total content",
    "is constrained by the requirement that the two types of one - qupit pauli matrix distributions be consisent with the set of all pauli operators , which must appear in the full complement .",
    "* theorem iii : * within any full complement of @xmath0 mub s , every qupit is perfectly pure in @xmath2 basis sets , and totally entangled in the remaining @xmath3 .    *",
    "proof : * consider the @xmath55th qupit . recall that the total number of pauli operators ( excluding @xmath32 ) is @xmath80 , and that these exactly accommodate the @xmath0 compatibility groups containing @xmath81 traceless operators each .",
    "each pauli matrix factor @xmath66 appears in @xmath82 pauli operators , except for @xmath83 which appears in @xmath84 because we are not counting @xmath32 in the individual groups .",
    "this number must equal the sum of @xmath83 factors appearing in all of the compatibility groups . according to the previous theorem , there are @xmath85 such factors in compatibility groups in which the @xmath55th qupit is pure , and @xmath86 such factors in all other compatibility groups .",
    "if @xmath87 is the number of compatibility groups ( or basis sets ) in which it is pure , then , in order to account for all @xmath83 factors , we must have p^2n-2 -1 = _ s^ ( p^n-1 -1 ) + ( p^n+1-_s^)(p^n-2 -1 ) . [ accounting ] solving this equation , we find the number of basis sets in which the @xmath55th qupit is pure , _",
    "s^ = p+1 , [ nusubs ] and consequently , the number of basis sets in which it is totally entangled , _",
    "e^ = p^n - p. [ nusube ]    the following corollary arises when all qupits take their pure states simultaneously : * corollary * : the maximum number of product mubs is @xmath2 , and in any mub complement where this number is realized , all of the remaining mubs ( @xmath3 ) must be totally entangled ( in the sense that every qupit is totally entangled ) @xcite .",
    "this is the standard distribution .",
    "note that the probability of finding the @xmath55th qupit pure in a mub state picked at random from any full complement is equal to the averaged purity ( ) , p_i _",
    "comp^ = _ s^ _ s^+_e^ = p+1 p^n+1 , [ piave ] which vanishes exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the @xmath88 cases in turn . the first two are simpler , and we find that theorems i and iii are sufficient to determine all possible mub distributions , although ii provides useful insights . with @xmath6 , we require theorem ii in deriving more detailed constraints that apply to individual qupits .    * bipartite systems *    clearly , if one qupit is pure , then so must be the other . in light of theorem",
    "i , then , both purities must be unity , or both zero . because these purities coincide",
    ", the corollary of theorem iii applies : there are @xmath2 product bases and @xmath89 totally entangled bases - the standard distribution is inevitable .",
    "we shall refer to all of the entangled bases as generalized bell bases , because they share the common property that their compatibility groups consist solely of two - body operators , , those containing no @xmath90 factors @xcite . to see the consequences of this , write one of the two generators as @xmath91 .",
    "the most general eigenstates of @xmath63 may then be written as @xmath4-term expansions in the product basis of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , = 1 _ k c_k _ u _ v , [ bform ] where the eigenvalues of @xmath94 are @xmath95 and the coefficients @xmath96 are determined by the other generator , call it @xmath97 .",
    "commutativity demands that both @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so @xmath64 induces cyclic permutations ( of order @xmath4 ) in the product states @xmath100 .",
    "therefore the @xmath96 are unimodular , and the @xmath4 eigenvalues ( @xmath101 ) of @xmath64 are nondegenerate , like those of @xmath63 .",
    "this confirms explicitly what we know from theorem i - namely , that measurements of one - qupit properties ( , @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) must produce random distributions over all possible outcomes .",
    "the generalized bell states defined above are contained within a broader class definitions given elsewhere @xcite . the more restrictive definition given here - defining classes of states by the pauli operators of which they form eigenbases - applies nonetheless to all mubs that are compatible with known full complements , and",
    "we shall employ such definitions throughout this work as we proceed to larger n.    we note for future reference that the precise form of the product state expansion ( [ bform ] ) depends on the choice of basis .",
    "a bad choice would require a @xmath78-term expansion , but even a good choice could look slightly different .",
    "for example , if eigenstates of @xmath102 were expanded in the same product basis used in , one would find sums of @xmath103 .    as a final note on bell states",
    ", our working definition may be given in words alone : a generalized bell state is any totally entangled two - qupit eigenstate of pauli operators ( since total entanglement requires that the two pauli operators be of the form @xmath94 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "* tripartite systems *    the standard mub complement has @xmath2 product bases and @xmath105 totally entangled bases .",
    "we shall refer to all of _ these _ totally entangled bases as generalized ghz , or @xmath44-bases , because they have common properties describable as follows :    let us first illustrate with a specific example that generalizes a standard choice of generators for qubits @xcite , g ( g_1 , g_2 , g_3 ) = ( xxy ,  xyx ,  yxx ) , [ ghz1 ] to arbitrary @xmath4 . to identify an optimal product basis for an expansion , replace the latter two generators by @xmath106 and @xmath107 . recalling the usual definition @xmath108 on the @xmath55th qupit ( modulo possible phase factors ) , the result is g = ( xxy ,  izz^-1 ,   ziz^-1 ) .",
    "[ ghz2 ] clearly the most general joint eigenstates of @xmath109 and @xmath110 are @xmath4-term expansions in the standard basis , = 1 _ k c_k , [ ghz3 ] where @xmath101 and @xmath95 are the eigenvalues of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , and the @xmath96 are determined by @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath96 are again unimodular because @xmath63 generates a cyclic group of order @xmath4 , of which the @xmath4 product states form a basis .",
    "this again illustrates the randomness of one - qupit properties in totally entangled states .    to demonstrate the commonality of all totally entangled three - qupit bases",
    ", we note that at least one generator must be a three - body operator ( having no @xmath90 factors ) , which we write in complete generality as @xmath111 .",
    "now , according to theorem ii , the inverse of each factor occurs @xmath4 times in the compatibility group , once with the inverse of @xmath63 itself , and @xmath28 times in other three - body operators in which it is the only inverse ( footnote @xcite ) .",
    "choosing two from the latter category , one containing @xmath112 and the other containing @xmath113 , and multiplying @xmath63 by each in turn , we obtain the generator set g = ( uvw ,  ibc ,  aic ) , [ ghz4 ] where compatibility requires that @xmath114 is common to @xmath64 and @xmath76 as indicated . clearly , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath114 define the product basis for the @xmath4-term expansions , = 1 _ k c_k _ a _ b _ c , [ ghz5 ] and each of @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath114 must differ from corresponding factors that appear in three - body operators of the compatibility group .",
    "in other words , every three - body operator in the compatibility group induces cyclic permutations of the states composing the product basis .",
    "the similarity of generator sets shows that all totally entangled three - qupit bases have @xmath4-term expansions in some special product basis , and that all of their compatibility groups ( of the same @xmath1 and @xmath4 ) have the same numbers of three - body and two - body operators .",
    "again , a purely verbal definition is possible : a generalized ghz state is any totally entangled 3-qupit eigenstate of pauli operators .",
    "a general statement for @xmath117 is possible but less categorical .",
    "the new aspect of mubs that enters with @xmath118 is the appearance of a third ( nonstandard ) mub type , and with it , the possibility of composing a full complement with varying combinations .",
    "the third type is biseparable , and thereby nonsymmetric with respect to qupits - one qupit separates , leaving the other two in a bell state .",
    "we shall refer to these as `` separable - bell '' bases , with the shorthand notation @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 if we wish to identify the pure qupit ) .",
    "such mub bases are known for @xmath7 and 3 ( ) , and to describe them for arbitrary @xmath4 , we consider a generator set s_1b = ( iia ,  uvi ,  sti ) , [ sb1 ] where @xmath94 and @xmath104 are commuting two - body operators acting on qupits 2 and 3 .",
    "the @xmath79 joint eigenstates of this set may be written as = , [ sb2 ] which describes qupit 1 in the @xmath47th eigenstate of @xmath115 , and qupits 2 and 3 in the bell state denoted by the eigenvalues @xmath121 and @xmath4 of @xmath94 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the compatibility group of @xmath122 is a tensor product of that associated with qupit 1 ( @xmath123 ) and that of the bell basis of qupits 2 and 3 .",
    "the tensor product is a common characteristic of all separable mubs , and the eigenstates of a particular mub all have the same character - the separation pattern involves the same entangled subsets of qupits , and the nature of the entanglement within each subset is the same .",
    "the three mub types discussed above , including the three variations of the sb bases , exhaust all of the possibilities for three qupits .",
    "the remaining question now is , what combinations the three types of bases may appear in the full complement ?",
    "one can answer this question simply by conserving the number of pure qupits while conserving the number of basis sets .",
    "we then find that we can remove a single product basis ( @xmath124 ) while adding three @xmath119 and removing two @xmath44 bases : + 2 g 3sb [ stoich1 ] table i shows the possibilities for three particles with any @xmath4 .",
    "the cases of @xmath125 and 3 dramatize the role of totally entangled states with increasing dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "in fact , case ( a ) , dimension @xmath126 , is the only multiparticle mub dimension in which a complement can be found with no totally entangled bases . and",
    "more typically , a majority of mubs are totally entangled : in case ( b ) at least 4/7 of all bases are @xmath44 bases , and even for _ two _ qutrits , 6 of the 10 bases are bell bases . for @xmath118 and general @xmath4 ,",
    "the minimum number of @xmath44 bases is given by @xmath127 , an ever - increasing fraction of the total number of bases as @xmath4 increases .",
    "@xmath128    @xmath129",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath119 bases can be introduced only in steps of three , reflecting the condition that the three variations @xmath130 must balance in the full complement , since the other mub types are symmetric with respect to permutations of qupits .",
    "this condition follows from the conservation of pure states for each qupit separately .",
    "* quadrapartite systems *    the @xmath6 case is more complex in a number of respects . most importantly ,",
    "new mub types enter with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "but even with @xmath7 , the number of distinct mub types exceeds the number of separation patterns .",
    "figure 1 shows the five separation patterns that characterize all @xmath4 , and lists seven mub types , six of which account for all @xmath7 options , and a seventh which represents , but is not exhaustive for @xmath131 .",
    "let us first discuss the mub types for general @xmath4 , and later specialize to particular cases for constraints and stoichiometries .",

    "thus we predict that when @xmath1 is equal to any prime plus 1 , then that prime ( @xmath179 ) is a critical value for the emergence of new entangled states as @xmath4 is increased at fixed n. these states should play critical roles in filling mub complements for @xmath4 equal to or slightly greater than @xmath180 .",
    "we have exploited the connections between mubs and pauli operators to develop a general framework for investigating both the entanglement properties of individual mubs , and the combinations of such mubs that can be found in full complements .",
    "we began by proving general theorems regarding mubs as eigenbases of pauli operators : we showed that the purities of individual qupits in such eigenbases must be either 0 or 1 , that the purity alone dictates the distribution of pauli matrix factors ( including @xmath90 ) in the compatibility groups of these mubs , and that every qupit must adopt these special purities the same number of times within any mub complement : ( @xmath2 ) times pure , and ( @xmath3 ) times totally entangled .",
    "an immediate corollary is that one may have at most @xmath2 product mubs in a full complement , and when one does , all remaining mubs must be totally entangled .",
    "this defines the standard distribution .",
    "armed with these theorems and the general properties of pauli operators , one quickly obtains more specific results : when @xmath12 , only product and generalized bell bases are possible , for any @xmath4 , and the standard mub distribution is inevitable . with @xmath118 ,",
    "the unique totally entangled bases are generalized ghz bases , but a third mub type becomes possible , namely separable - bell bases .",
    "this makes possible @xmath5 distinct mub distributions . with @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "there are six mub types , including two nonseparable bases and a third ( @xmath136 ) that is separable but totally entangled .",
    "there are 48 possible mub distributions , with cluster bases making up the majority of mubs in most of these . with @xmath6 and larger @xmath4 ,",
    "further mub types exist , and at least one such mub type ( @xmath150 ) is essential to forming a standard mub complement with @xmath165 , and to forming _ any _ mub complement with @xmath166 .",
    "several results have emerged in the course of working the above examples , and it seems useful to synthesize these in one place : ( 1 ) a mub can exist in any separation pattern .",
    "( 2 ) all states in a particular mub have common separation and entanglement patterns - the generator set contains all information about the nature of the entanglement , while the eigenvalues specify the states .",
    "( 3 ) compatibility groups of separable bases are tensor products of those of the nonseparable constituent bases .",
    "it follows that ( 4 ) within nonseparable groupings of qupits , those with two qupits must be in generalized bell states , those with three qupits - generalized ghz states .",
    "those with 4 qupits have the same broader array of options available to 4-qupit systems .",
    "perhaps the most important lesson to be drawn from the present examples is that , although it is easy to construct mubs from those found at lower @xmath1 , either as tensor products , or as larger-@xmath1 counterparts such as @xmath181 , the more interesting challenge is to find the new nonseparable mub types , with no counterparts at smaller @xmath1 ( or sometimes @xmath4 ) , that make full complements possible .",
    "it may be a general feature that such mubs tend to dominate mub distributions near the @xmath1 and @xmath4 values where they first emerge , only to be superceeded by other mub types as the system size increases . in this sense , every @xmath1 is critical , but not every @xmath4 .",
    "we predict that when @xmath1 is a prime plus 1 ( , @xmath182 , 8 , ... ) , there will be a critical value , @xmath183 , for the introduction of new entangled states that will play critical roles in mub distributions .    closing thoughts on the existence question : the intimate connection between mubs and entanglement for @xmath184 highlights the way in which all known mub complements take advantage of the symmetry associated with equivalent parts , unique to dimensions @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "theorem i , which makes no reference to dimension , can not hold in ( at least some ) composite dimensions : in the simplest counterexample , 6 dimensions , the qubit can be totally entangled , but the qutrit can not be . yet , the import of theorem i is that for all known mub complements , there exists a factorization into parts ( represented by some set of generalized pauli operators ) , in terms of which theorem i ( and the others ) hold . thus , in addition to the existence question in composite dimensions , there is also an existence question in @xmath42 dimensions - do mub complements exist that violate theorem i ? perhaps entanglement considerations such as the present ones will help in answering these persistent questions .",

    "we first argue that both are the unique nonseparable representatives of their respective @xmath25-body profiles as shown on table iii .",
    "we then show that other profiles can not exist for qubits .",

    "but , by virtue of this fact , the @xmath136 basis has four independent two - body operators , so that these can compose the generator set .",

    "one might wonder whether a different basis could be found with the same profile by using four - body generators in place of the three - body generators .",
    "the answer is no - it is easy show that this would generate only @xmath144 or @xmath136 bases , depending upon whether one of the four - body generators shares factors with one of the two - body generators .",
    "the remaining point is to rule out other four - qubit profiles .",
    "it suffices to consider just the two - body operators , whose maximum number is six .",
    "we will show that the numbers 4 and 0 are impossible for qubits .",
    "the former case is very simple - it is impossible to find four commuting two - body operators that do not generate two more ( and these will immediately identify themselves as belonging to either a @xmath144 or @xmath136 compatibility group ) . as to the latter case ,",

    "commutativity demands that they have exactly one other factor in common , so that their product is a two - body operator .",
    "this forms a contradiction and shows that there is no profile without two - body operators .    to briefly summarize the results of this appendix , the 6 mub types listed on table iii exhaust the possibilities for four qubits .",

    "<S> a few simply - stated rules govern the entanglement patterns that can occur in mutually unbiased basis sets ( mubs ) , and constrain the combinations of such patterns that can coexist ( , the stoichiometry ) in full complements of ( @xmath0 ) mubs . </S>",
    "<S> we consider hilbert spaces of prime power dimension ( as realized by systems of @xmath1 prime - state particles , or _ qupits _ ) , where full complements are known to exist , and we assume only that mubs are eigenbases of generalized pauli operators , without using a particular construction . </S>",
    "<S> the general rules include the following : 1 ) in any mub , a particular qupit appears either in a pure state , or totally entangled , and 2 ) in any full mub complement , each qupit is pure in ( @xmath2 ) bases ( not necessarily the same ones ) , and totally entangled in the remaining ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the maximum number of product bases is @xmath2 , and when this number is realized , all remaining ( @xmath3 ) bases in the complement are characterized by the total entanglement of every qupit . </S>",
    "<S> this `` standard distribution '' is inescapable for two qupits ( of any @xmath4 ) , where only product and generalized bell bases are admissible mub types . </S>",
    "<S> this and the following results generalize previous results for qubits @xcite and qutrits @xcite , drawing particularly upon . with three qupits </S>",
    "<S> there are three mub types , and a number of combinations ( @xmath5 ) are possible in full complements . with @xmath6 , there are 6 mub types for @xmath7 , but new mub types become possible with larger @xmath4 , and these are essential to realizing full complements . with this example , we argue that new mub types , showing new entanglement characteristics , should enter with every step in @xmath1 , and when @xmath1 is a prime plus 1 , also at critical @xmath4 values , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> such mubs should play critical roles in filling complements . </S>"
