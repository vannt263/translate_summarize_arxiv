    "the measurement of heavy - flavour production provides insights on the properties of the high - density qcd medium created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . the comparison of charm production in pp and in pb ",
    "pb collisions allows one to study the mechanism of in - medium partonic energy loss of heavy quarks which are expected to lose less energy with respect to light partons due to the presence of the so called `` dead cone '' effect  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since strange quarks are abundant in the medium  @xcite , the relative yield of @xmath0-mesons with respect to non - strange charm mesons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) is predicted to be largely enhanced if in - medium hadronization is the dominant mechanism for charm hadron formation in the low momentum region  @xcite . a sensitive observable in order to address these open questions is the nuclear modification factor , which is defined for a given particle species @xmath7 as @xmath8= @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the yield measured in heavy - ion collisions , @xmath11 is the average nuclear overlap function calculated using the glauber model and @xmath12 is the production cross section in pp collisions at the same energy . in these proceedings",
    "we present the first measurement of the nuclear modification factor of the @xmath0-meson in pb ",
    "pb collisions at 2.76  tev performed in the central rapidity region of the alice experiment . a detailed description of the pp results used as a reference for this analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "open charm measurements are performed in alice using the tracking detectors and particle identification systems of the central barrel , which covers the pseudo - rapidity region -0.9 @xmath13 0.9 and is embedded in a magnetic field of b = 0.5 t. the central barrel detectors allow to track charged meson down to low transverse momenta ( @xmath14 100 mev / c ) and provides charged hadron and electron identification as well as an accurate measurement of the positions of the primary and secondary ( decay ) vertices  @xcite .",
    "a short description of the detectors utilized in these analyses will be given in this section .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is the main tracking detector which provides track reconstruction and particle identification via the measurement of the specific energy deposit @xmath15 .",
    "the inner tracking system ( its ) is the central barrel detector closest to the beam axis and it is composed of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors .",
    "the two innermost layers ( at radii of 3.9 and 7.6 cm ) are made of pixel detectors ( spd ) , the two intermediate layers ( radii @xmath14 15 and 24 cm ) are equipped with drift detectors , while strip detectors are used for the two outermost layers ( radii @xmath14 39 and 44 cm ) .",
    "the its is crucial to reconstruct secondary vertices originating from open charm decays because it allows for the measurement of the track impact parameter in the transverse plane with a resolution better than 50 @xmath16 m for tracks with @xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 gev/@xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector is used for pion , kaon and proton identification on the basis of their time of flight .",
    "the tof measurement provides kaon / pion separation up to a momentum of about 1.5 gev/@xmath19 .",
    "all the three detectors have full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the data sample used for this analysis has been collected during the 2011 lhc run ( november - december 2011 ) with pb  pb collisions at @xmath20 = 2.76 tev and it consists of 16 million events selected in the centrality range 0  7.5@xmath21 according to centrality - based trigger requirements on the signal from the spd and from the vzero detectors .",
    "the latter is made of two scintillator hodoscopes positioned in the forward and backward regions of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "only events with a vertex found within @xmath22 10 cm from the centre of the detector along the beam line were used for the analysis .",
    "@xmath0 mesons and their antiparticles were reconstructed in the decay chain @xmath23 ( and its charge conjugate ) followed by @xmath24 .",
    "the branching ratio ( br ) of this chain is @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 mesons have a mean proper decay length @xmath26  @xcite which allows to resolve their decay vertex from the interaction ( primary ) vertex .",
    "thus , the analysis strategy for the extraction of the signal out of the large combinatorial background can be based on the reconstruction and selection of secondary vertex topologies with significant separation from the primary vertex .",
    "the @xmath0 meson candidates are built starting from track combinations with proper charges and selected according to topological cuts .",
    "single tracks are previously selected with respect to to their pseudorapidity ( @xmath27 @xmath28 0.8 ) , momentum and to quality cuts .",
    "candidates are then filtered by applying kinematical and topological cuts together with particle identification criteria in order to improve the statistical significance while keeping the selection efficiency as high as possible .",
    "the candidate triplets were selected according to the sum of the distances of the decay tracks to the reconstructed decay vertex , the decay length and the cosine of the pointing angle , that is the angle between the reconstructed @xmath0 meson momentum and the line connecting the primary and the secondary vertex .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 candidates were selected by requiring that one of the two pairs of opposite - charge tracks has an invariant mass compatible with the pdg value for the @xmath29 meson mass  @xcite .",
    "the same topological and pid strategy has been adopted in the pp and pb  pb analyses with tighter topological selection cuts used in nucleus - nucleus collisions to cope with the higher combinatorial background . in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmass ] the invariant mass distributions of @xmath0 candidates in the centrality interval 0  7.5@xmath21 in three @xmath17 bins from 4 to 12 gev/@xmath19 are presented . to evaluate the signal yield , a fit to the distributions with a gaussian function for the signal and an exponential shape for",

    "the measured raw yields were corrected for acceptance and selection efficiency of prompt @xmath0 mesons using monte carlo simulations based on pythia ( perugia-0 tuning )  @xcite and hijing  @xcite . the correction factor that accounts for the feed - down from b meson decays",
    "was evaluated using the monte carlo efficiency for feed - down @xmath0 mesons and the fonll calculations , which describe well bottom production at tevatron  @xcite and at the lhc  @xcite . in the pb ",
    "pb analysis , the contribution estimated with fonll was multiplied by the average number of binary collisions estimated via the glauber model @xmath30 and by the hypothesis on the energy loss of @xmath0 from b ( @xmath31 ) ( more details in  @xcite ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the b feed - down subtraction was estimated as the full spread of the results obtained by varying the fonll parameters and the values of @xmath31 ( the latter only in the pb ",
    "pb case ) . in particular , the hypothesis on the @xmath31 has been varied in the range 1/3 @xmath28 @xmath31/@xmath32 @xmath28 3 .",

    "the total systematics include the uncertainties on signal extraction , track reconstruction efficiency , cut and pid selection and on the b feed - down subtraction .",
