    "a @xmath1-bridge knot is a knot that has a diagram in which there are two distinct arcs , each overpassing a consecutive sequence of crossings , and every crossing in the diagram is in one of these sequences .",
    "the two arcs are called the bridges of the diagram ( compare with @xcite , p. 23 ) .    - numerator or denominator closures of rational tangles ( see figures 1 , 5 ) .",
    "a rational tangle is the result of consecutive twists on neighbouring endpoints of two trivial arcs . for examples",

    "it is obtained from a four - strand braid by plat - closing only the top four ends . )",
    "conway @xcite also defined _ the fraction _ of a rational tangle to be a rational number or @xmath3 he observed that this number for a rational tangle equals a continued fraction expression with all numerators equal to one and all denominators of the same sign , that can be read from a tangle diagram in alternating standard form .",

    "more than one rational tangle can yield the same or isotopic rational knots and the equivalence relation between the rational tangles is mapped into an arithmetic equivalence of their corresponding fractions .",

    "we have located the essential points in the proof of the classification of rational knots in the question : _ which rational tangles will close to form a specific knot or link diagram ? _ by looking at the theorems in this way , we obtain a path to the results that can be understood without extensive background in three - dimensional topology .",
    "in the course of these proofs we see connections between the elementary number theory of fractions and continued fractions , and the topology of knots and links . in order to compose these proofs we use the fact that rational knots are alternating ( which follows from the fact that rational tangles are alternating , and for which we believe we found the simplest possible proof , see @xcite , proposition 2 ) .",
    "we then rely on the _ tait conjecture _ @xcite concerning the classification of alternating knots , which states the following : _ two alternating knots are isotopic if and only if any two corresponding reduced diagrams on @xmath19 are related by a finite sequence of flypes ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "_    a diagram is said to be _ reduced _ if at every crossing the four local regions indicated at the crossing are actually parts of four distinct global regions in the diagram ( see @xcite p. 42 . ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that any knot or link has reduced diagrams that represent its isotopy class .",
    "the conjecture was posed by p.g .",
    "tait , @xcite in 1877 and was proved by w.  menasco and m.  thistlethwaite , @xcite in 1993 .",

    "we prove theorem [ schubert1 ] about the classification of unoriented rational knots by means of a direct combinatorial and arithmetical analysis of rational knot diagrams , using the classification of rational tangles and the tait conjecture . in section 4",
    "we discuss chirality of knots and give a classification of the achiral rational knots and links as numerator closures of even palindromic rational tangles in continued fraction form ( theorem [ mirror ] ) .",
    "in section 5 we discuss the connectivity patterns of the four end arcs of rational tangles and we relate connectivity to the parity of the fraction of a rational tangle ( theorem [ connectivity ] ) . in section 6 we give our interpretation of the statement of theorem [ schubert2 ] and we prove the classification of oriented rational knots , using the methods we developed in the unoriented case and examining the connectivity patterns of oriented rational knots . in section 6 it is pointed out that all oriented rational knots and links are invertible ( reverse the orientation of both components ) . in section 7 we give a classification of the strongly invertible rational links ( reverse the orientation of one component ) as closures of odd palindromic oriented rational tangles in continued fraction form ( theorem [ strongly ] ) .    here is a short history of the theory of rational knots . as explained in @xcite , rational knots and links were first considered by o. simony in 1882 , @xcite , taking twistings and knottings of a band .",
    "simony @xcite was the first one to relate knots to continued fractions .",
    "after about sixty years tietze wrote a series of papers @xcite with reference to simony s work .",
    "reidemeister @xcite in 1929 calculated the knot group of a special class of four - plats ( viergeflechte ) , but four - plats were really studied by goeritz @xcite and by bankwitz and schumann @xcite in 1934 . in @xcite and @xcite proofs are given independently and with different techniques that rational knots have @xmath20-strand - braid representations , in the sense that the first strand of the four - strand braids can be free of crossings , and that they are alternating .",
    "( see figure 20 for an example and figure 26 for an abstract @xmath20-strand - braid representation . )",

    "he then showed that the four - plats are exactly the knots that can be represented by diagrams with two bridges and consequently he classified rational knots by finding canonical forms via representing them as @xmath1-bridge knots , see@xcite .",
    "his proof was based on seifert s observation that the @xmath1-fold branched coverings of @xmath1-bridge knots @xcite give rise to lens spaces and on the classification of lens spaces by reidemeister @xcite using reidemeister torsion and following the lead of @xcite ( and later by brody @xcite using the knot theory of the lens space ) .",

    "the calculations can be done by multiplication of generating matrices for continued fractions just using the parity algebra .",
    "for example , in case a of figure 36 we add two new odd parity terms to @xmath459 in order to obtain @xmath467 thus we multiply the parity matrix for @xmath459 by the product    @xmath468    in order to obtain the parity matrix for @xmath467    in particular , if @xmath459 is in case 3 of figure 35 , then it has fraction parities @xmath380 and @xmath379 and hence parity matrix @xmath469 multiplying this by @xmath470 we obtain @xmath471 thus the new @xmath438 for @xmath457 is even . since the connectivity diagram for @xmath457 in this case , as shown in figure 36 ,",
    "has compatible standard and palindrome cuts , this result for the parity of @xmath438 is one step in the verification of the induction hypothesis .",
    "each of the six cases is handled in this same way .",
    "we omit the remaining details and assert that the values of @xmath438 obtained in each case are correct with respect to the connection structure .",

    "an oriented knot or link is invertible if it is oriented isotopic to the link obtained from it by reversing the orientation of each component . we have seen ( lemma [ invertible ] ) that rational knots and links are invertible .",
    "a link @xmath472 of two components is said to be _ strongly invertible _ if @xmath472 is ambient isotopic to itself with the orientation of only one component reversed . in figure 37",

    "this link is well - known as the whitehead link , a link with linking number zero .",
    "note that since @xmath101 , [ 1 ] , [ 2]]$ ] has fraction equal to @xmath474 this link is non - trivial via the classification of rational knots and links .",

    "it follows that strongly invertible links are all numerators of rational tangles of the form @xmath102 , [ a_2 ] , \\ldots , [ a_k ] , [ \\alpha ] , [ a_k ] , \\ldots , [ a_2 ] , [ a_1]]$ ] for any integers @xmath480    _ proof .",

    "thus to apply theorem [ schubert2 ] we need to perform a bottom twist on @xmath179 since @xmath49 and @xmath165 have the same fraction @xmath485 after applying the twist we need to compare the fractions @xmath124 and @xmath486 since @xmath9 is not congruent to @xmath487 modulo @xmath411 , we need to determine when @xmath488 is congruent to @xmath117 modulo @xmath489 this will happen exactly when @xmath490 for some integer @xmath158 the last equation is the same as saying that @xmath479 with @xmath491 odd , since @xmath9 is odd .",
    "now it follows from the palindrome theorem for continued fractions that @xmath479 with @xmath438 odd and @xmath8 even if and only if the fraction @xmath124 with @xmath299 has a palindromic continued fraction expansion with an odd number of terms ( the proof is the same in form as the corresponding argument given in the proof of theorem @xmath492 ) .",

    "hence it is strongly invertible .",
    "it follows from this that all strongly invertible rational links are ambient isotopic to themselves through a @xmath66 rotation just as in the example of the whitehead link given above .",
