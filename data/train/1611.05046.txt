    "while the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite was a major success for the standard model ( sm ) , open theoretical questions remain .",
    "if the higgs boson is an elementary scalar field , the stability of the electroweak scale against radiative corrections is not understood , since fields of this type receive quadratically divergent corrections to their mass - squared . of the proposed solutions to this well known hierarchy problem , one of the best motivated is supersymmetry ( susy ) , where every sm fermion(boson ) is complemented with a superpartner boson(fermion ) .",
    "elementary scalar masses are protected because a cancellation occurs between the quadratically divergent correction coming from loops with sm particles and their corresponding superpartners enforced by the enlarged symmetry of the model .",
    "nevertheless , susy must be broken in order to be consistent with non - observation of superpartners to date .",
    "this breaking lifts the superpartner masses to a relatively high scale set by the susy breaking sector and messenger mass  @xcite .",
    "as the superpartners become more massive , the expected mass of elementary scalars goes up and fine - tuning is likely required to explain light scalars .",
    "since the higgs boson receives the largest correction to its mass from a loop involving top quarks , the most important susy particle for protecting the higgs boson mass is the superpartner of the top quark  the top squark or stop  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the electroweak scale is dominantly set by stop masses and mixing , in addition to the tree level mass scales in the superpotential and soft susy breaking potential .",
    "thus , the natural expectation is that the lightest third generation squarks should be observable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , since the mass scales that set the electroweak scale in the mssm must not be too far away from the observed electroweak scale in order to avoid large amounts of fine tuning . while a considerable amount of natural mssm parameter space has been excluded by the most recent results from the lhc  @xcite ,",
    "viable regions remain , such as the compressed region @xcite .",
    "these regions are likely difficult to achieve in a top down susy breaking model .    in this paper ,",
    "we accept some fine tuning and focus on a new method to search for pair - produced stops with a mass near 1 tev which decay to top quarks and light neutralinos , a scenario which has not yet been excluded by the lhc run 2 .",
    "we assume the neutralino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) with a mass around 100 gev , which also makes it a possible thermal relic weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidate .",
    "the signal that our new method will be applicable to is @xmath2 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for earlier studies of two hadronic tops ) , where the tops decay hadronically and the missing transverse energy @xmath3 comes from the two neutralinos which leave the detector .",
    "currently , for searches with two hadronic tops , the atlas collaboration has imposed a constraint which requires the stop mass to be above 820 gev with 13.3 @xmath4 of integrated luminosity , assuming 100% decay branching for the channel @xmath5  @xcite and a light neutralino mass below around 200 gev .",
    "similarly , the cms collaboration has obtained a limit of 860 gev with 12.9 fb@xmath1 data  @xcite . as the @xmath3 cut",
    "is increased to optimize for heavier stops , it becomes increasingly likely that the two tops in the decay have a small angular separation and that the signals of their decay products overlap in the detectors .",
    "we develop a new boosted top tagging procedure that recovers merged top jets , which we call `` merged top tagger . ''",
    "our starting point is the well - known heptoptagger algorithm @xcite . rather than simply trying to find a single combination of subjets in a fat jet that looks like a top",
    ", the algorithm searches through various combinatoric possibilities in an attempt to find a total of two top - like groups of subjets .",
    "further sensitivity is gained by using the new information of both tops kinematics to construct and cut on the @xmath0 variable @xcite . based on simulations",
    "we have performed , our strategy shows a 50% improvement in @xmath6 and slight improvement in discovery sensitivity for @xmath7 stops decaying to tops and @xmath8 detector - stable neutralinos .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : motiv ] , we motivate the need for a new analysis strategy to deal with merged hadronic tops .",
    "we present our merged top tagger algorithm in section  [ sec : algo ] .",
    "we then study the increased sensitivity to search for heavy stops in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the simulation detail is presented in appendix  [ app : simulation ] .",
    "for the region of parameter space with @xmath9 , the top quark is boosted and the three partons from the top quark decay are collimated . in similar scenarios with boosted top quarks ,",
    "both collaborations at the lhc have opted to reconstruct events using jet - substructure techniques such as top - tagging . assuming conservation of r - parity , the two neutralinos in the final state will be stable and contribute significantly to the total missing transverse energy , @xmath3 .",
    "because of this fact , imposing a large @xmath3 cut is a very efficient way to increase the signal over background ratio .",
    "however , we find that imposing a large @xmath3 cut isolates the sub - region of phase space of the signal where the neutralinos are approximately aligned to provide large @xmath3 , resulting in the tops ( which recoil off the neutralino momenta ) also being approximately aligned . because the pair - produced stops are not very relativistic , the top and neutralino pairs end up approximately back to back . as a result",
    ", one should anticipate that a significant fraction of signal events will have geometric overlapping between the six partons from two hadronic tops , a scenario we call _ merged top - jets_. the schematic picture of the region of phase space for signal events under discussion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the subject of this paper will be a new search strategy for the merged top - jets case , with the goal of improving the discovery potential of stops at the lhc .    .",
    "to provide large @xmath3 , the neutralino momenta must approximately align .",
    "this also results in alignment of the tops , which recoil off the sum of the neutralino momenta .",
    "when performing jet - substructure analysis with a large value of the jet clustering parameter @xmath10 , the six partons from the two hadronic tops are likely to be included in a single fat jet . ]    to quantitatively understand the fraction of signal events with two merged tops , we first study the signal events at the parton level . throughout this paper , we will assume benchmark masses of @xmath11  tev and @xmath12  gev , and @xmath13 .",
    "the lightest stop mass is chosen to be close to the reach of the lhc run 2 with 100 fb@xmath1 . in our simulation , we have the stop to be mainly right - handed , although our later kinematic analysis is insensitive to this choice ( for the detailed analysis for left - handed and right - handed stops , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : parton_splitting ] , we define a measure to demonstrate the alignment of the two tops as the cut on @xmath3 is increased .",

    "then we define @xmath16 as the maximum separation among all pairs with two partons belonging only to the top or anti - top",
    ". the ratio of these two quantities , @xmath17 , will be small when the smallest distance between one parton from the top and one parton from the anti - top is smaller than the largest distance between partons in the same top or anti - top , which is the aligned or merged scenario . as a result",
    ", we expect the event distribution of this measure to shift to smaller values as the cut on the missing transverse energy is increased , and this expectation is confirmed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : parton_splitting ] .    when two partons from the top and anti - top are geometrically close to each other , the standard jet - substructure analysis to tag boosted top - jets",
    "becomes problematic .",
    "this is because the large fat - jet analysis employed frequently fails to isolate the two tops in separate fat jets . to demonstrate this issue at parton level ,",
    "we apply the cambridge / aachen clustering algorithm  @xcite with @xmath18 to the signal events and count the number of partons belonging to the top or anti - top contained in each fat jet .",
    "in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : parton_splitting ] , one can see that the fully merged 0 + 6 case ( all partons in one fat jet ) and the partially merged 2 + 4 case ( 2 partons in one fat jet , 4 partons in another ) account for 54.7% of the events , with the separated 3 + 3 case accounting for 45.2% of the events .",
    "the 1 + 5 and 1 + 2 + 3 cases are extremely sub - dominant due to the fat jet definition including a transverse momentum cut of @xmath19  gev .",
    "it is now clear that the standard jet - substructure analysis is not optimal for reconstructing our signal events after a large @xmath3 cut , since standard top taggers ( which assume well isolated tops by only searching for one top tag per fat jet ) frequently fail to tag two tops in the fully or partially merged cases which constitute a majority of our signal events after a large @xmath3 cut . to fully recover the signal kinematics and define additional transverse - mass variables like @xmath0 ,",
    "it is important to resolve and tag the two top - jets with high efficiency . in next section of this paper ,",
    "we develop a search strategy based on the heptoptagger  @xcite algorithm and check the improvement of signal over background after the particle - level simulations .",
    "having established our motivation for tagging two merged top - jets , we now develop a jet - substructure based algorithm to reconstruct both boosted hadronic tops for the signal and background .",
    "our algorithm for tagging two merged top - jets is based on the existing top - tagging algorithm of heptoptagger in ref .",
    "@xcite , although it can also be implemented using other top - tagging methods such as n - subjettiness  @xcite . before discussing our algorithm",
    ", we briefly summarize the features of heptoptagger . by default",
    ", heptoptagger takes a single fat jet as an input , on which it will perform a mass drop  @xcite operation to obtain a list of the relevant hard substructure .",
    "it then iterates through all pairings of three hard subjets and filters  @xcite each triplet in order to define the triplet mass .",
    "it then keeps _ only _ the triplet which has a filtered mass closest to the top mass @xmath20 .",
    "this single remaining triplet is then required to pass additional mass constraints which ensures the triplet does not behave like a qcd event and that it satisfies some top and @xmath21 gauge boson mass constraints .    for our signal events , after a large @xmath3 cut , the two top - jets have a significant probability of being merged , and the original heptoptagger algorithm becomes less efficient .",
    "this is because the original heptoptagger algorithm can find at most one top per fat jet , even in the case where the input fat jet contains two tops .",
    "furthermore , even in the one top per fat jet case , the original algorithm will fail when the triplet with the best filtered mass fails the mass criteria , even though there may exist other triplets with filtered masses still not that far away from the top quark mass , but a better chance to pass all mass criteria . to address those issues ,",

    "<S> we study an interesting region of phase space at the lhc for pair - produced stops decaying into hadronic top quarks and light neutralinos . after imposing a sizeable cut on the missing transverse energy , which is the key variable for reducing backgrounds , we have found that the two hadronic tops are likely to merge into a single fat jet . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a jet - substructure - based strategy to tag the two merged top - jets and utilize the @xmath0 variable to further reduce the backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain about a 50% increase to the ratio of the signal over background and a mild increase on the signal discovery significance , based on a signal with a 1.2 tev stop and a 100 gev neutralino , for the 13 tev lhc with 100 fb@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the general event kinematics could also occur and be explored for other new physics signatures with large missing transverse energy . </S>"
