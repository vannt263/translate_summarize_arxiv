    "are weakly scattered by the magnetic impurity , but below @xmath0 the scattering becomes strong . in the simplest kondo systems , only one electron mode ( the @xmath1-wave mode , say ) participates in the screening of a localized spin with @xmath2 . in this case , the low - temperature electronic properties are adequately described by fermi liquid theory  @xcite , and the thermodynamic and transport characteristics are analytical functions of @xmath3 . in more complicated systems ( such as ,",
    "e.g. , paramagnetic metals ) many electron modes may participate in screening of an @xmath2 localized moment  @xcite .",
    "the peculiarities of such a  multichannel ",
    "kondo model were long recognized  @xcite . at the same time",
    "it was understood that even a small deviation from symmetry between channels leads at low temperatures to the kondo screening by just one channel , the one for which the exchange integral with the impurity is the largest  @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of a _ symmetric _ multichannel kondo problem is in its non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature asymptotes of the thermodynamic and transport characteristics display power - law behavior with fractional values of the exponents .",
    "a complete temperature dependence of the thermodynamic characteristics ( such as the local spin susceptibility ) is known now from the exact bethe - ansatz solution of the kondo problem  @xcite .",
    "details of the low - temperature electron scattering problem were also understood in the framework of conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "experimental observation of the non - fermi - liquid behavior in a kondo system , however , is difficult because the channel symmetry is not `` protected ''  in general , there are no conservation laws prescribing such a symmetry .",
    "this has lead to various propositions to observe such a behavior in systems where the role of spin is taken over by another degree of freedom , while the `` real '' spin labels the channels , making the channel symmetry robust .",
    "one such idea deals with an atomic defect which occupies two equivalent lattice sites , thus forming a pseudospin  @xcite .",
    "however , the equivalence of sites is not a protected symmetry ; its violation  @xcite , equivalent to a `` zeeman splitting '' of the pseudospin states , destroys the kondo effect .",
    "another object which under certain conditions can be described by the two - channel kondo model ( 2ck ) model , is a large quantum dot , or a metallic island connected by a single - mode channel to a conducting electrode  @xcite .",
    "if one neglects the finite level spacing in the island , then a pseudospin labeling of the charge states of the island may be introduced , while real spin again plays the part of the channel index . in this setup the degeneracy with respect to the pseudospin orientation is easily achieved by tuning the gate voltage to the vicinity of the coulomb blockade degeneracy point . at temperatures @xmath4 higher than the level spacing @xmath5 in the island ,",
    "the system is then described by the 2ck model  @xcite .",

    ", one can study the transport properties of the resulting device .",
    "the disadvantage of such realization of a 2ck system is that there is no mapping between the conductance across the island  @xcite and the electron scattering cross - section in the generic two - channel kondo model  @xcite .",
    "small quantum dots with large level spacing have proved to be suitable for the observation of the kondo effect  @xcite . in the usual geometry consisting of a dot with two attached electrodes ,",
    "however , only the conventional fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior is observable at low temperatures .",
    "the reason lies in the structure of the matrix of exchange constants that couple the dot s spin to the spins of itinerant electrons  @xcite .",
    "typically , the eigenvalues of this matrix are vastly different  @xcite , and their ratio is not tunable by conventional means .",
    "a device that circumvents this problem was proposed recently in ref .  , and involves several dots .",

    "[ device ] ]    in principle , a setup having just one lead and two dots would allow one to study thermodynamic properties , such as magnetic susceptibility , in the 2ck regime .",

    "therefore , two leads are needed to perform conductance measurements . in this paper , we assume that one of the electrodes is coupled weakly to the small dot and serves as a probe of the 2ck system formed by the two dots and the remaining electrode .",
