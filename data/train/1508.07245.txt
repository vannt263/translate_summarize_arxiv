    "the hifi water spectrum of g349.7 + 0.2 shows another interesting feature , different from other snrs ( e.g. s05 ) or astronomical objects : a narrow ( fwhm=3.7 km / s ) emission line ( the nwl component ) .",

    "are observed , in particular for ysos associated with pdrs ( kristensen et al .",
    "2012 ) , and this gas may have been released from ices by photodesorption . for g349.7 + 0.2 , the existence of ices along the line of sight is expected following the extinction of @xmath29 = 30 mag , high densities and temperatures below the sublimation temperature of @xmath9100 k. this indicates there is a source of non - thermal desorption , particularly due to photodesorption @xcite .",
    "the nwl might trace sublimation or photodesorption of the ices near the uc hii region , although it is presently unclear if the uc hii region is associated with the snr , or if its location is related to the dense cloud which interacts with the snr .",
    "alternately , a strong cosmic ray flux or a secondary fuv field generated by the cosmic ray destruction of h@xmath5 might photodesorb h@xmath5o , but in this case a strongly enhanced cosmic ray flux would be needed , considering that the observed nwl is ten times stronger than that observed in the dense core l1544 ( caselli et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "more likely , however , shocks may have released h@xmath5o into the gas phase .",
    "the narrow component of co showed blue- or red - shifted emission and the central velocity differs at different positions ; the co gas is suggested to have shocked origin ( dubner et al .",
    "the fact that the velocity of nwl is consistent with the co indicates that they are from the same gas .",
    "we suggest that the nwl is likely shocked gas from denser clumps or reformed molecules behind a dissociative shock ( see section 5 for details ) .",
    "further observational evidence would be needed to determine the origin of the nwl .",
    "the bwl component with fwhm of 27 km  s@xmath2   is comparable to those in ic 443 observed by snell et al .",

    "<S> an extremely broad emission line was detected at 557 ghz from the ground state transition 1@xmath0 - 1@xmath1 of ortho - water . </S>",
    "<S> this water line can be separated into three velocity components with widths of 144 , 27 and 4 km  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the 144 km  s@xmath2 component is the broadest water line detected to date in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this extremely broad line width shows importance of probing shock dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> pacs observations revealed 3 additional ortho - water lines , as well as numerous high - j carbon monoxide ( co ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> no para - water lines were detected . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely broad water line is indicative of a high velocity shock , which is supported by the observed co rotational diagram that was reproduced with a j - shock model with a density of 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and a shock velocity of 80 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> two far - infrared fine - structure lines , [ o  i ] at 145 micron and [ c  ii ] line at 157 micron , are also consistent with the high velocity j - shock model </S>",
    "<S> . the extremely broad water line could be simply from short - lived molecules that have not been destroyed in high velocity j - shocks ; however , it may be from more complicated geometry such as high - velocity water bullets or a shell expanding in high velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the co and h@xmath5o densities , column densities , and temperatures by comparison with radex and detailed shock models . </S>"
