    "black holes are the ultimate test of strong gravity , spacetime so warped that not even light can escape . by definition",
    "they have no emission ( apart from hawking radiation ) , yet their immense gravitational potential energy can be tapped by any infalling material .",
    "this can power a luminous accretion flow where the emission has its origin close to the black hole event horizon , as is seen in many objects including active galactic nuclei , galactic black hole binaries , ultra - luminous x - ray sources and gamma ray bursts .",
    "photons emitted in this region are subject to general relativistic effects such as light - bending , gravitational lensing and redshift , as well as special relativistic effects as the emitting material will be moving rapidly ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are well - understood from a theoretical standpoint , so accreting objects provide a natural laboratory to test the properties of strong gravitational fields .",
    "calculations of the relativistic corrections to photon properties have been ongoing for nearly three decades , starting with the classic work of @xcite who calculated the distortions expected on the spectrum of a geometrically thin , optically thick , keplerian accretion disc orbiting a kerr black hole .",
    "interest in these calculations dramatically increased with the realisation that the accretion disc could emit _ line _ as well as continuum radiation .",
    "iron k@xmath3 fluorescence resulting from x - ray irradiation of the accretion disc can give a narrow feature , on which the relativistic distortions are much more easily measured than on the broad accretion disc continuum @xcite .",
    "since then , several groups have developed numerical codes that are capable of determining these effects both for standard discs @xcite and alternative emission geometries @xcite .    while the problem is well - defined",
    ", there are many technical and numerical issues which arise in calculating the effects of strong gravity .",
    "lightbending can result in lensing which strongly amplifies the emission , so a very small area of the accretion flow can make a large contribution on the observed flux . here",
    "we describe how to efficiently calculate the effects of strong lightbending , and illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by using the code to compute the most extreme lightbending possible , the higher order images and spectra of an accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the first order image is from photons from the underside of the disc which are bent back into the observers line of sight , while second order images are produced by photons from the upper side of the disc which complete a full orbit around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "obviously such paths must cross the equatorial plane , so are likely to re - intercept the disc . for an optically thick disc",
    "then this returning radiation adds to the intrinsic disc emission , and can enhance the emissivity at small radii for extreme kerr black holes though it has little effect for schwarzchild @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the first order image of the disc can dominate the flux at high inclinations if the optically thick disc has rather limited radial extent .",
    "even if it does not , some of the higher order image flux can escape to the observer through the inner hole in the disc below the radius of the minimum stable orbit , assuming that the plunging region is optically thin ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction escaping through this inner hole is rather larger for schwarzchild than for kerr , as the size of the gap between the innermost stable orbit and horizon is larger for the non - spinning black hole .",
    "obviously , such paths are exquisitely sensitive to the gravitational potential , being close to the true photon orbit point which is the ( unstable ) crossover between capture by the black hole , and escape to infinity .",
    "this makes them potentially an excellent test of strong gravity , and they could be observable in nearby luminous agn with micro - arcsec imaging x - ray interferometers such as maxim ( @xcite ) .",
    "such instruments could also observe the _",
    "spin _ of a nearby supermassive black hole simply from the size of the _ direct _ image @xcite , assuming that the mass and distance are known .",
    "a disc down to the last stable orbit extends down to 6  @xmath4 in schwarzchild but only 1.23  @xmath4 in extreme kerr . lightbending is stronger in kerr than in schwarzchild , but the apparent size of the hole in the disc still changes by a factor of @xmath5",
    "this contrasts with the case where the accretion flow has emission down below the last stable orbit , where the size of the true black hole shadow is rather similar for both schwarzchild and kerr @xcite .",
    "observations of the galactic black hole binaries support to the idea that there is a disc down to the minimum stable orbit in certain , fairly high luminosity spectral states @xcite .",
    "however , at lower luminosities this is probably replaced by a more complex accretion flow which may have continuous energy release down to the horizon @xcite . while the stellar remnant black holes require nano - arcsecond imaging to resolve , nearby luminous agn also should have a hole in the disc from the minimum stable orbit which is accessible to maxim .",
    "the paper is split into two parts . in section 2",
    "we introduce the relevant theory necessary to perform efficient calculation of photon properties in strong gravity , including a review the properties of the effective potentials governing photon motion . in section 3",
    ", we apply these techniques to examine the contribution of orbiting photons to the standard accretion disc solution through images of the inner region of the accretion flow , generation of fluorescent iron k@xmath3 line profiles and the relative roles played by the different types of photon paths .",
    "readers not interested in technical details should go straight to section 3 .",
    "material in an accretion flow near to a black hole emits radiation , which is received by a ( possibly distant ) observer .",
    "these photons enable the observer to form an image of the flow , which in turn determines the measured spectral properties @xcite . in the geometric optics approximation , the photons follow null geodesics , which in the kerr metric ( written in boyer - lindquist coordinates with @xmath6 ) are described by @xcite : @xmath7 \\\\",
    "p^{t } = \\dot{t } = \\rho^{-2 } \\delta^{-1 } \\left ( \\sigma^{2 } -       2ar \\lambda \\right )     \\end{split } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where as usual @xmath8 is the angular momentum of the source ( normalised to mass so that @xmath9 corresponds to the extremal case ) and dotted quantities denote differentiation with respect to some affine parameter .",
    "we introduce the metric functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the effective potentials ( @xcite ) : @xmath13 ^{2 }         - \\delta \\left [ q - \\left ( \\lambda - a \\right ) ^{2 } \\right ] \\\\         \\theta_{\\lambda , q } \\left ( \\theta \\right ) = q + a^{2 } \\cos^{2 } \\theta -\\lambda^{2 } \\mathrm{cot}^{2 } \\theta       \\end{split } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 are constants of motion which are related to the photons covariant angular and linear momenta ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the kerr metric is both stationary and axisymmetric so the derived set of geodesic equations ( [ eqn:2.1.2 ] ) are independent of both of the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the properties of a given geodesic path ( specified by a @xmath14 pair ) are completely determined by the first two of these equations , which can be merged together and integrated to form a governing equation : @xmath17 consider the radial motion of the geodesic , described by the left - hand side of the above .",
    "we fix the ends of the radial trajectories at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which leads us to the general form for radial motion : @xmath20    \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , we have denoted the radial turning point ( either perihelion or aphelion ) of the path motion by @xmath21 and @xmath22 can take the values @xmath23 dependent on the nature of the path . from the discussion of @xcite , there are no bound null geodesics that terminate above the horizon , implying that at most there can be one radial turning point along the geodesic path",
    ". there are therefore three types of radial motion that we must consider :    1 .   from @xmath18 to @xmath19 with no radial turning point encountered , implying either @xmath24 if @xmath25 or @xmath26 if @xmath27 .",
    "2 .   from @xmath18 inwards to perihelion at @xmath21 , then outwards to @xmath19 , implying that @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   from @xmath18 outwards to aphelion at @xmath21 , then inwards to @xmath19 , implying that @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    for the latitudinal motion we can , in general , have an arbitrary number of turning points occur along the path ( unlike in the radial case ) .",
    "this requires a more complex expression to describe the contribution of the latitudinal motion .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath34 : @xmath35 \\\\      + \\left [ 2 n_{m } - s^{1}_{m } s^{2}_{m } \\left ( 1 + s^{2}_{m } \\right ) \\right ]      \\int^{m_{+}}_{m_{- } } { \\frac{dm}{\\sqrt { m_{\\lambda , q}(m ) } } }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] the effective potential now takes the form @xmath36 . in the above ,",
    "@xmath37 denote the locations of the latitudinal turning points determined by solution of @xmath38 @xcite , whilst @xmath39 denotes the number of such turning points through which the path passes and @xmath40 can take the values @xmath23 . specifically , the case of @xmath41 is described by two possibilities :    1 .   if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 dependent on whether the path is initially directed towards the north or south poles of the hole respectively .",
    "2 .   if @xmath44 , then @xmath41 is in the direction of the closest of @xmath37 to @xmath45    the sign of @xmath46 is determined by the number of turning points , @xmath39 through which the geodesic passes , @xmath47 .",
    "geodesic paths are therefore described by : @xmath48 this can be solved analytically in terms of elliptic functions , which is much more efficient than numerical solutions .",
    "@xcite tabulate these functions to determine the observed coordinate latitude , @xmath49 for photons with momenta @xmath50 emitted from a given radius and latitude which arrive at the observers radial coordinate . alternatively ,",
    "@xcite fix one end of the radial path at infinity with some inclination and the coordinates at which the other end crosses the equatorial plane .",
    "an additional method , due to @xcite fixes the ends of the photon paths at the required coordinates , and a minimisation technique is applied to determine valid @xmath51 pairs for a given number of orbits of the black hole .    our approach combines aspects of those described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we invert the reformulated governing equation to obtain the observed co - ordinate latitude of the geodesic , using the technique described by @xcite : @xmath52      \\int^{m_{+}}_{m_{- } } { \\frac{dm}{\\sqrt { m_{\\lambda , q}(m ) } } }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] we apply the properties of the effective potentials described by @xcite to dramatically reduce the scale of the calculation by analytically restricting the range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 to those which can escape to infinity",
    ". then we search this range for those paths which contribute to a given image order at the required observed inclination .",
    "these geodesics are then projected to form an image of the system on the observers sky , which is then used to determined the measured flux ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "the code therefore allows the fast calculation of geodesics linking any two points in the spacetime that make a specified number orbits of the black hole .      [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for our purposes , three particular cases describing the behaviour of the @xmath55 curve are of interest . to illustrate these",
    ", we consider an extreme kerr ( @xmath56 ) hole , with the observer located at radial infinity and an inclination of @xmath57 .",
    "we locate the emitter in the equatorial plane and begin by considering the case @xmath58 ( figure [ fig:2.2.1 ] , left panel ) . here",
    ", the region of the angular momentum @xmath59 plane for which no potential barrier is formed between the emitter and observer is bounded from below by @xmath60 , as described by equation [ eqn:2.3.4 ] .",
    "the upper limit of this region is provided by @xmath61 and it can be shown that , independent of the locations of the emitter and observer , these curves are concave and convex functions of @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that we can provide limits on the allowed range of @xmath53 via : @xmath62 the apparent angular size of the black hole is defined by the parametric curve @xmath63 .",
    "hence , photons whose angular momentum falls under this curve and are directed initially inwards towards the hole from @xmath64 are inevitably captured . for @xmath65 ,",
    "this critical curve intersects the graph of @xmath66 at some @xmath67 ( the exact intersection being determined numerically ) and so inwardly directed photons with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is determined by inversion of @xmath71 , can be completely excluded from the calculation .",
    "we now move the location of the emitter inwards such that @xmath72 ( figure [ fig:2.2.1 ] , centre panel ) .",
    "we have that the valid region of the angular momentum plane is bounded from below by @xmath60 , as before .",
    "the behaviour of the upper bound to the angular momentum plane is , however , quite different . in this case , since @xmath73 , there exists some @xmath74 , which is associated with a @xmath75 pair , through equations ( [ eqn:2.3.5 ] ) . for @xmath76 , we therefore have that the upper limit of the angular momentum plane is given by the critical curve and hence the lower limit on @xmath53 is determined by @xmath77 . similarly , above @xmath78 , the upper limit on the plane",
    "is given , as in the previous case , by @xmath61 and so the upper limit on @xmath53 is given by @xmath79 .",
    "note that , for @xmath80 there are no photons that are emitted on radially inbound geodesics that reach the observer , whilst for @xmath81 , only those initially ingoing photons with values of @xmath54 above the critical curve can reach the observer .",
    "finally , we note that for the emitter located at @xmath82 ( figure fig:2.2.1 , right - hand panel ) , the graph of @xmath55 is now convex .",
    "however , the relationship between the various curves remains unchanged from that described in the previous case and the angular momentum plane remains bound .",
    "we begin by considering solutions to the governing equation for a simple system where the emitter is located in the equatorial plane of an extreme kerr ( @xmath56 ) hole ( @xmath83 ) and takes the form of an infinitesimal ring located at radius @xmath18 .",
    "for such an infinitesimal ring , the flux is undefined ( since the ring subtends zero solid angle on the observers sky ) and so we concentrate our attention on the behaviour of the solutions on the @xmath84 and @xmath85 planes ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] ) . to minimise the impact of gravitational lensing",
    ", we locate the observer at radial infinity and @xmath57 ( as previously ) .",
    "initially , we locate the ring at @xmath86 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel a ) and catalogue the complete set of geodesics of zeroth ( @xmath87 ) , first ( @xmath88 ) and second ( @xmath89 ) order .",
    "each of these geodesic orders form a closed loop on both the @xmath90 and @xmath91 planes .",
    "we note that the projections on both planes are asymmetric about the line @xmath92 due to the breaking of spherical symmetry by the black hole spin and also ( for the emitter located at @xmath93 ) that the loops for each individual image order are completely detached .",
    "we now move the emitter inwards to @xmath94 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel b ) , which causes the loops associated with the zeroth and first order images to overlap .",
    "the solutions to the geodesic equations are therefore multivalued at these points in @xmath84 space , breaking the statement by @xcite that there are two geodesics linking a point on the accretion disc to an observer for each value of the redshift parameter , @xmath95 , which ( for the keplerian disc considered by cunningham ) , corresponds to two geodesics at each valid point in @xmath53 space .",
    "if we now move the emitter inwards to @xmath96 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel c ) , we now see that the loops associated with the zeroth order geodesic now overlaps with both the first order loop and the second order loop .",
    "we now move the emitter further inwards , so that @xmath97 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel d ) . here",
    ", the zeroth order loop still overlaps the first and second order loops , however , in this case the first and second order loops now touch . moving the emitter inwards still further to @xmath98 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel e )",
    ", the zeroth order loop now detaches itself from the first and second order loops and moves inside these loops on the @xmath91 plane projection .",
    "the apparent angular size of the zeroth order loop , as measured by the distant observer , is now smaller than that of the first and second order loops , which has important consequences for the calculation of the emergent flux , as we shall shortly see .",
    "finally , we move the emitter down to @xmath99 ( figure [ fig:2.3.1 ] , panel f ) , the location of @xmath100 in boyer - lindquist coordinates ( however , this is not the case in terms of proper distance , see @xcite ) .",
    "all of the loops are again detached , however , in comparison to the case where @xmath86 , the ordering of these loops is now reversed on the @xmath91 plane , with the second order now subtending the greatest angular size of the observers sky .",
    "we now replace the central extreme kerr black hole with a schwarzschild ( @xmath101 ) black hole and repeat the preceding calculation . from figure [ fig:2.3.2 ] , we see that the behaviour of the solutions on the two planes is qualitatively similar to that of the extreme kerr case as we move the emitter from @xmath93 down to @xmath102 .",
    "however , in this case we note that the loops are now symmetric about the line @xmath103 due to the absence of rotation in the system and that this results in the quantitative locations of the overlap to change . note that we can understand the existence of these overlaps by considering the meaning of the projection of these loops on the @xmath84 plane .",
    "recall that , for given @xmath84 pair , there exists a set of roots @xmath104 of the effective potentials @xmath105 , @xmath106",
    ". whether or not the geodesic path passes through selected members of these sets of roots depends on the initial direction taken by the geodesic , described by the @xmath107 parameters in equation [ eqn:2.2.4 ] and hence different geodesic paths can be described by a single @xmath108 pair .",
    "consider now the behaviour of these loops as we move the emitter to @xmath109 for the schwarzschild hole ( figure [ fig:2.3.2 ] , panel d ) . here",
    ", we find that the zeroth and first order loops are now detached , but in this case the second order loop does not exist .",
    "moving the emitter in further to @xmath110 ( figure [ fig:2.3.2 ] , panel e ) , we find that not only does the first order loop disappears , but the zeroth order loop is no longer closed ! finally , if we move the emitter to @xmath111 ( figure [ fig:2.3.2 ] , panel f ) , then we find that we are only able to image a small line segment from the ring . to understand this behaviour , we turn to the discussion given by @xcite regarding the cone of avoidance , describing the cone generated the photons that pass through the unstable circular orbits located at @xmath112 .",
    "we let @xmath113 denote the half - angle of the cone ( directed inward at large distances from the hole ) and it can then be shown that : @xmath114 we therefore see that for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , which implies that below @xmath117 , the apparent angular size of the black hole is greater than that of the distant stars .",
    "this shows that the black hole obscures part of the region @xmath118 for a distant observer when the emitter is located below @xmath119 , which implies that the dynamics of the accretion flow in this region are extremely difficult to directly measure .              in the standard picture of accretion onto a massive compact object , the emitting material is located in the equatorial plane in what is assumed to be a geometrically thin structure . as such",
    ", gravitational lensing effects only come into play for high inclination systems ( @xmath120 ) . however , if one wishes to consider emission from a non - equatorial geometry ( the case of a geometrically thick , optically thin accretion flow , for example ) , then gravitational lensing effects can have important consequences even for low inclination observers . as an example , consider again two infinitesimal rings , located at @xmath94 , with polar coordinates @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we again locate the observer at radial infinity and initially take @xmath123 such that @xmath124 ( figure [ fig:2.4.1 ] left panel ) .",
    "the two rings form are mapped continuously onto the @xmath125 plane for each individual image order in a similar fashion to those considered previously .",
    "we now move the latitudinal coordinate of the observer to @xmath57 , such that @xmath126 ( figure [ fig:2.4.1 ] centre panel ) .",
    "the image of the lower ring , @xmath127 is again mapped continuously onto the @xmath125 plane for each individual image order , as would be expected as it s relationship to the latitudinal coordinate of the observer has remained unchanged .",
    "this is not true however of the image of the upper ring , @xmath128 , which is now mapped discontinuously onto the @xmath129 plane , with the even image orders ( zeroth and second ) appearing from the southern hemisphere of the hole and the odd image orders ( first ) appearing from the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is therefore clear that , in order to generate a complete picture of the physical properties of such a system , we must include the contribution of the higher orders to the calculation .",
    "finally , we again move the observer in the latitudinal direction to @xmath130 , such that @xmath131 ( figure [ fig:2.4.1 ] right panel ) . now",
    "the images of both rings are mapped discontinuously onto the @xmath129 plane , which serves to further emphasise the importance of the inclusion of the higher order images in the calculation .",
    "the contribution of higher order images to the observed flux is dependent both on the location of the observer and the angular momentum of the hole itself , together with the assumed geometry and emissivity of the accretion flow . for an optically thick accretion disc then any photons which re - intersect the disc after emission will be either absorbed ( and then re - emitted ) or reflected by the material .",
    "figure [ fig:3.1.1 ] shows the contributions of both the direct ( @xmath87)and higher order ( @xmath132 ) images of a geometrically thin disc extending from @xmath133 to @xmath134 , viewed at @xmath135 for both schwarzschild and maximal kerr black holes .",
    "the principle effect of black hole spin for the accretion disk dynamics is to move the location of the marginally - stable orbit , @xmath133 and hence the location of the inner edge of the accretion disc . in the case of the schwarzschild hole ,",
    "the inner edge of the accretion disc is located at @xmath136 , above the radius of the unstable photon orbits ( @xmath112 ) so higher order image photons which cross the equatorial plane below @xmath136 are not absorbed by the disc and may be able to freely propagate to the observer .",
    "this contrasts with the extreme kerr hole behaviour , where the accretion disc extends down to @xmath137 , completely obscuring the allowed radial range of the unstable photon orbits ( @xmath138 , though mostly @xmath139 for the polar orbits which dominate the low inclination image ) and hence the contribution of the higher order photons is completely obscured by the accretion disc .",
    "figure [ fig:3.1.2 ] shows the same systems viewed at a range of large inclination angles , @xmath140 . as in the previous discussion for the schwarzschild hole ,",
    "the inner edge of the accretion disc is located above the location of the photon orbits and hence the majority of the orbiting photons are able to propagate freely to the observer .",
    "however , photons in the first order image of the far side of the disc now have paths which pass rather closer to the hole than at lower inclination , so the importance of lensing is increased , strongly amplifying this part of the image .",
    "most of these photons cross the equatorial plane at @xmath141 , so can be seen in our simulation , but would be obscured by a more physically realistic disc which is not entirely flat and has outer edge @xmath142 .",
    "these photons instead would illuminate a large region of the underside of the disc as the direct image of the disc , adding to its intrinsic emission .",
    "by contrast , the area on the sky of the second order image remains approximately constant with increasing inclination , reflecting the sensitivity ( i.e. instability ) of the two - loop photon orbits .",
    "( left - hand panel ) and @xmath143 ( right - hand panel ) images of a thin , keplerian accretion disc around an extreme kerr black hole , with the disc extending from @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "the observer is located at radial infinity with an inclination of @xmath144 .",
    "the images are highly asymmetric , indicating the strong coupling of these photons to the bacl hole spin ]    the high inclination extreme kerr images are shown in figure [ fig:3.1.2 ] , bottom row .",
    "the disc itself blocks all the higher orbit images close to the black hole , similar to the @xmath145 case .",
    "part of the first order image where the geodesic crosses the equatorial plane at @xmath146 can be seen , and this fraction increases with increasing inclination of the observer .",
    "indeed , for the highest inclination system considered in this work , the apparent angular size of the first order image is approximately equivalent to that subtended by the direct image .",
    "by contrast to the schwarzschild case , we note that the images of the extreme kerr system are strongly asymmetric about the horizontal axis due to the effect of the black hole spin , with the degree of this asymmetry increasing with the inclination of the observer .",
    "this asymmetry is most pronounced for the ( unobscured ) first and second order images generated from the highest inclination system ( see figure [ fig:3.1.3 ] ) . here",
    ", the effect of the range of radii for orbiting photons can be seen most clearly in the second order image .",
    "the image is offset from zero as the ones on the left are the photons which are emitted from the side of the disc approaching the observer , so go with the spin of the black hole and orbit at @xmath147 , while photons on the right are the retrograde ones at @xmath148 .",
    "the hole in the inner disc is symmetric at @xmath147 , so it ( just ) obscures all the prograde photons and easily obscures the retrograde ones . a small decrease in spin ( e.g. to a=0.998 , the equilibrium spin for thin disc accretion ) increases @xmath133 to @xmath149 , while the photon orbits span @xmath150 , so a small part of the prograde higher order image can be seen .",
    "the fraction of higher order photons which can escape through the hole increases with increasing spin until @xmath151 @xcite , where the photon orbits are all within @xmath133 .                  to understand how the astrophysical properties of the accretion flow couple to the gravitational field of the black hole , we generate relativstically smeared line profiles as described in @xcite . for clarity",
    ", we briefly recap this method here .",
    "we consider an intrisically narrow emission line with rest energy , @xmath152 , for which the flux distribution measured by a distant observer at an energy @xmath153 is given by : @xmath154 here , @xmath155 is the local emissivity of the accretion disc , which we take to have the form @xmath156 , where @xmath157 describes the initial direction of the photon relative to the local z - axis of the emitting materlal . the flux at each redshift in each image order",
    "is then calculated directly from the area subtended on the observers sky , together with the intrinsic disc emissivity ( both radial and angular ) .",
    "this gives the transfer function for monochromatic flux , so the observed emission is the convolution of this with the intrinsic disc spectrum . in the case of intrinsically monochromatic radiation , e.g. the iron k@xmath3 fluorescence line which can be produced by x - ray illumination of cool , optically thick gas , then this transfer function directly gives the expected line profile .",
    "photons produced by this emission process in regions close to the black hole enable us to examine the properties of the multiple orbit photons considered in the preceding section from a spectroscopic perspective .    to generate the line profiles , we apply a radial emissivity of the form @xmath158 ( consistent with gravitational energy release within the disc , @xcite ) and consider three possible angular emissivity laws : ( i ) @xmath159 , corresponding to an optically thick disc ( red lines ) ; ( ii ) @xmath160 , corresponding to an optically thin , limb brightened disc ( blue lines ) @xcite and ( iii ) @xmath161 corresponding to an optically thick , limb darkened disc ( green lines ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:3.2.1 ] shows the line profiles generated for the low inclination schwarzschild disc discussed in the preceding section .",
    "whilst in the case of the extreme kerr black hole ( figure [ fig:3.1.1 ] , bottom row ) , all orbiting photons returned to the inner region of the disc , for the schwarzschild hole ( figure [ fig:3.1.1 ] , top row ) these photons cross the equatorial plane below @xmath133 and can freely propagate to the observer ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "examination of their spectral properties shows that these photons play a limited role in forming the overall spectral shape measured by a distant observer , which is completely dominated by the contribution from the direct image .",
    "figure [ fig:3.2.2 ] shows the line profiles generated for a schwarzschild hole , with the accretion disc now viewed at high inclination ( ignoring the effect of obscuration ) . for the direct image , limb darkening boosts the effects of gravitational lensing , enhancing the flux from the far side of the hole .",
    "this is because these photons are strongly bent , i.e. are emitted from a lower inclination angle than that at which they are observed , so a limb darkening law means that the flux here is higher @xcite .",
    "the doppler shifts are rather small for this material , so this lensing enhances the flux in the middle of the line .",
    "since the line profiles are normalised to unity , this means that the blue wing is less dominant .",
    "the first order spectra are shown in figure [ fig:3.2.2 ] , middle row .",
    "the transfer functions mostly retain the characteristic double peaked and skewed shape , and again the principle effect of the different angular emissivities is to alter the balance between the blue wing and lensed middle of the line .",
    "however , there is some new behaviour for the limb brightened emissivity .",
    "this has the largest change in emissivity with angle , and this combined with the exquisite sensitivity of lensed paths means that this picks out only a small area on the disc , leading to a discrete feature in the spectrum .",
    "these profiles also show enhancement of the extreme red wing of the line , as the photons which orbit generally are emitted from the very innermost radii of the disc .",
    "the discrete features are completely dominant for all emissivities at second order ( figure [ fig:3.2.2 ] , bottom row ) . these are images of the top of the disc where the photons have orbited the black hole , so the paths are even more sensitive to small changes than first order .",
    "thus the profiles are significantly more complex in structure , being dominanted by lensing .",
    "there are blue and red features at the extreme ends of the line profile which are picking out the maximum projected velocity of the innermost radii of the disc .",
    "these have the standard blue peak enhancement .",
    "however , the two strong features redward of this are a pair of lensed features , from the near and far side of the disc .",
    "figure [ fig:3.2.3 ] shows the line profiles generated for the extreme kerr hole at high inclinations , again ignoring the effect of obscuration . for the direct image ( figure [ fig:3.2.3 ] , top row ) , the lines exhibit the characteristic triangular shape previously reported by ( e.g ) @xcite , with the variation in angular emissivity acting to alter the balance between the different regions of the line on a @xmath162 level .",
    "the lines associated with the first order image ( figure [ fig:3.2.3 ] , middle row ) exhibit a marked difference in comparison to those associated with the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in general , they are broader that those associated with the direct image and resemble a skewed gaussian combined with a narrow line ( due to caustic formation ) at @xmath163 . here",
    "the principle effect of changes in the angular emissivity is to alter the height of the blue wing , relative to the rest of the line .",
    "again , the line profiles associated with the second order image ( figure [ fig:3.2.3 ] , bottom row ) are completely dominated by discrete features , as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "to @xmath134 and the observer is located at radial infinity .",
    "we show the contributions from ( a ) the direct image ( red lines ) ,",
    "( b ) the first order image ( blue lines ) and ( c ) the second order image ( green lines ) . in all cases",
    ", we have applied a @xmath164 radial emissivity and have considered angular emissivities of the form ( i ) @xmath165 ( solid lines ) , ( ii ) @xmath160 ( short dashed lines ) and ( iii ) @xmath166 ( long dashed lines ) . in the case of the schwarzschild hole , the contribution from the higher order images is @xmath167 of the total luminosity , even at high inclinations . however , in the case of the extreme kerr black hole , at inclinations of @xmath168 , the first order image can dominate the luminosity of the system , due to the formation of caustics within the image . ]    to understand the relative roles played by each ( unobscured ) image order , we consider the variation of the luminosity of each image as a fraction of the total luminosity of the system as a function of inclination , again for both schwarzschild and extreme kerr black holes ( figure [ fig:3.3.1 ] ) .",
    "these luminosities are generated from the integral in redshift space of the line profiles considered in the preceding section and hence we consider systems with identical properties to those previously discussed . in the case of the schwarzschild hole , we see that , for inclinations @xmath169 , the first order image can be regarded as a @xmath170 correction to the emergent flux from the system . for inclinations",
    "@xmath171 , this image contains @xmath172 of the emergent flux , i.e. even at these high inclinations , the first order image can still be regarded as a correction to the direct image . for the second order image , we see that it plays a @xmath173 role independent of inclination .",
    "third and higher order images will have correspondingly smaller fluxes , so can safely be neglected .",
    "there is a larger fraction of flux in the higher order images for the kerr black hole . at low inclinations ,",
    "the first and second order images contain @xmath174 and @xmath175 of the total flux , respectively .",
    "the variation of the luminosity fraction for the three image orders displays an approximately power law like behaviour for inclinations @xmath176 , where a distinct break occurs , due to the appearance of a caustic in the first order image , whose luminosity is therefore significantly enhanced .",
    "it is at this point that the peak luminosity of the second order image occurs , which here is on the level of @xmath174 , approximately an order of magnitude higher than in the schwarzschild case .",
    "remarkably , for inclinations @xmath177 , the luminosity of the first order image produced by the optically thick discs is _ greater _ than that produced by the direct image .",
    "however , most of the higher image order flux is expected to reintercept the disc plane , and hence be absorbed and reradiated .",
    "this is especially the case for realistic discs around an extreme kerr black hole , where the whole of the equatorial plane is covered by the disc from @xmath147 to large radii .",
    "however , for schwarzchild , the existance of a central hole means that the flux from higher order images can escape .",
    "a realistic disc around a scharwzchild black hole when viewed _ face on _ has @xmath174 of its flux in a higher order image ring ( dropping to @xmath178 for a more extended disk ranging from @xmath179 ) .",
    "essentially , a spatial resolution equivalent to @xmath180 is required to resolve these features , which for typical nearby active galactic nuclei corresponds to an angular resolution of @xmath181 microarcseconds .",
    "this is obviously extremely technically difficult , but is feasible for an x - ray interferometer imaging supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "photons orbiting a black hole encounter the strongest possible gravitational fields compatible with still escaping to the observer .",
    "thus these higher order null geodesics provide the best test of einsteins gravity in the strong field limit .",
    "we have developed a new strong gravity code capable of describing these paths , and calculate them for a geometrically thin , optically thick ( standard ) disc in both schwarzchild and kerr metrics .",
    "these higher order image paths must cross the equatorial plane , so are absorbed where this is filled by the optically thick disc . as has long been known ,",
    "the major amplification effects of gravitational lensing are for the first order paths from the far side of the underneath of the disc viewed at high inclination i.e. photons initially emitted downwards on the far side of the black hole , which are bent by gravity up above the disc plane .",
    "most of these paths will re - intersect the disc unless it has very limited outer radial extent .",
    "while such discs _ may _ exist @xcite , it seems far more likely that these photons would be absorbed by material in the equatorial plane .",
    "however , there is some fraction of the higher order images where the light paths are so strongly bent that they re - intersect the equatorial plane very close to the photon orbit radius . by definition",
    ", this is below the minimum stable orbit for particles , so the standard disc can not exist at this point . instead , for a stress - free inner boundary condition , the disc material plunges rapidly though this region , so there is much less absorbing material in the equatorial plane . this material may be optically thick at high mass accretion rates @xcite , but this depends on whether the flow in the plunging region in smooth or clumpy .",
    "hence higher order photons which cross the plane below @xmath182 need not be reabsorbed by the disc .",
    "we show that these _ observable _ higher order photons can carry 10% of the flux for a _",
    "face on _ disc .",
    "edge on discs _ reduce _ the expected observable flux as only about half of the orbiting photon ring can be seen through the gap below @xmath133 , while the rest re - intercepts the disc at @xmath183 .    the situation is less favourable in the kerr geometry as photons now orbit at a range of radii depending on how their angular momemtum is aligned with the spin of the black hole",
    ". photons going against the spin will orbit at radii which are larger than that of the minimum stable orbit of the disc , so should be absorbed rather than escaping through the inner hole in the disc ( provided @xmath184 ) .",
    "thus for kerr black holes , even though there is a greater fraction of photons in the higher order images , we expect that these are less observable due to the overlap between the photon and particle orbits .",
    "also , even though there is still a gap between the last stable particle orbit and the aligned photon orbits , this gap is much smaller than in schwarzchild , both in terms of radial coordinate and in terms of impact parameter on the sky . for a=0.998 , the equilibrium spin for thin disc accretion , @xmath185 while the @xmath186 , so @xmath187 . since the photons orbit in slightly stronger gravity ,",
    "their paths are more distorted , so the difference in their impact parameter at infinity is slightly less than the difference in radial coordinate .",
    "thus the higher order images round a rapidly spinning black hole are much more difficult to spatially resolve from the direct image of the disc , and carry less flux than schwarzchild as only a fraction re - intersect the plane below @xmath133 .",
    "thus the best chance of observing these higher order photon paths from a standard accretion disc is with a face - on schwarzchild black hole .",
    "x - ray interferometry could potentially directly resolve such scales for supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies , and such missions are being seriously proposed ( maxim : @xcite ) . even if the plunging region is optically thick , direct imaging with resolution @xmath188 will clearly show the black hole spin from the apparent size of the hole in the center of the disc .",
    "the radial coordinate of the innermost stable orbit in an equilibrium spin kerr metric is a factor of @xmath5 smaller than for schwarzchild , which translates to a change in apparent size at infinity of the hole diameter from @xmath189 ( a=0.998 ) to @xmath190 ( a=0 ) .",
    "this is important as recent papers have emphasised that the true size of the shadow of the event horizon ( in effect the impact parameter of the orbiting photons , given fairly accurately by our second order image ) is rather similar in both schwarzchild and kerr @xcite .",
    "this is true , but different to the size of the hole defined by the innermost stable orbit of the disc . for continuous energy release down to the event horizon ,",
    "the hole in the image of the accretion flow is set by the true shadow size , but for accretion flows where the energy is only released from stable particle orbits ( the disc , as opposed to the plunging region ) then the innermost stable orbit sets the size scale .",
    "whether the energy release can be continuous across @xmath133 is currently a matter of active research @xcite .",
    "however , there is clear observational evidence for an innermost stable orbit in the disc dominanted spectra of galactic black hole binaries @xcite , so it seems likely that the accretion flow can take the standard thin disc form assumed here .",
    "the spectral signatures of these photons only become apparent for high - inclination systems , where they carry between @xmath0 ( schwarzschild ) and @xmath1 ( extreme kerr ) of the total luminosity of the system .",
    "however , in a realistic system , the disc extends out to many thousands of gravitational radii from the black hole and so these photons return to the disc before reaching the observer .",
    "far from the central black hole , the effect of the returning radiation is comparable to the gravitational potential energy of the material and so these photons can play an important role in shaping the properties of the disc here . in particular , reprocessing of this returning radiation at large distances from the hole will potentially provide a physical mechanism to flatten ( at large radii ) the @xmath191 temperature profile of a planar accretion disc irradiated by a central source , which could help to resolve the conflict between the predicted and observed optical / uv colours in active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the code used to calculate these results is an extension of that of @xcite .",
    "the new aspect described here is a set of analytic constraints on the possible photon trajectories which vastly reduce the scale of the calculation .",
    "this , combined with the use of the analytic integrals ( elliptic functions ) for the photon paths , has the result that the calculation of a photon trajectory linking two points ( the emitter and observer , @xcite ) can be performed by a simple minimisation , capable of being calulated to almost arbitrary accuracy on a standard desktop pc on time scales of a few minutes .",
    "this technique allows us to include the contribution of orbiting photons in the calculations without loss of resolution .",
    "the code is also flexible enough to be adapted to _ any _ accretion flow , and a future paper will consider the contribution of the higher order images in an optically thin , geometrically thick flow ."
