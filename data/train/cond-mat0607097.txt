    "in 1998 , strehlow et al.@xcite discovered and anomalous low - temperature sensitivity of the dielectric properties of various dielectric glasses to a magnetic field .",
    "this findings continue to attract the attention both of experimentalists and theorists.@xcite as a result of further investigations , it was found that the effect was anomalously pronounced for an insulator in the absence of magnetic impurities .",
    "many low - temperature properties of glasses are successfully described by a standard tunneling model.@xcite in a good approximation the tunneling systems ( ts ) can be treated as a particle moving in a double - well potential ( dwp ) . after observing of the anomalous glassy behavior in a magnetic field ,",
    "several extensions of the standard tunneling model have been suggested.@xcite in our opinion , the model proposed by a.  wrger , a. fleischmann , c. enss@xcite is the most viable .",
    "it assumes that the tunneling particle possesses a nuclear electric quadrupole moment . as a result",
    ", the particle energy acquires an extra splitting @xmath1 in the crystal electric field gradient ( efg ) .",
    "it is important that , in general case , the local axis of efg differ in different wells of dwp ( see .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field then interacts with the nuclear spin magnetic moment and results in the zeeman splitting .",
    "this modifies nuclear spin states in each well thus affecting the tunneling system properties .",

    "quadrupole moment .",
    "thereupon , one can conclude that the quadrupole electrical moment of the ts s is the key feature responsible for the effect .    to our knowledge",
    ", there are several theoretical studies of the nuclear quadrupole effect on glassy dielectric properties.@xcite in papers@xcite we have investigated the low temperature limit @xmath5 @xmath6 we have shown that in this regime the nuclear quadrupole interaction results in the breakdown of coherent tunneling due to the formation of a nuclear spin polaron state of tunneling particle .",

    "the analytical approach below ( see .",
    "( [ no20 ] ) ) reveals that there is an insignificant dependence of the result on this angle , perhaps excluding the cases where @xmath71 for this reason , we assume the angle distribution to be uniform on the interval @xmath72    in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we are restricting our consideration to the single tunneling particle possessing a nuclear spin @xmath17 this assumption simplifies the analysis . in general , higher spins and multiple particles are possibly involved in a single tunneling system.@xcite .",
    "we assert , however , that our consideration captures the important physics .",
    "in particular , our assertion is based on the fact that we have not revealed any qualitative difference between spins @xmath18 and @xmath48 the effect of a multiparticle tls structure seems to be insignificant at high temperature where the effect of interest is a small perturbation and we can treat the nuclear quadrupole interaction for each particle belonging to a tunneling system independently . then , the resulting effect is reduced to a sum of single particle contributions . to take into account the complex tls structure",
    "one should multiply the quadrupole constant @xmath1 by a factor of the number of particles involved in the tunneling system .",
    "in the model considered in this paper the application of the external electric field makes the asymmetry parameter field dependent @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the strength of the field , and @xmath75{cc}% -\\mathbf{i } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\mathbf{i}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\label{no5}%\\ ] ] is the dipole - moment operator of the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ master ] ) , so that the dipole moment of the particle in the left well is @xmath76 while in the right well it is @xmath77    in our recent paper@xcite we have derived a general expression for the dielectric permittivity for the ensemble of quantum system each having a discrete energy spectrum @xmath78@xmath79 here @xmath78 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ master ] ) ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the cartesian coordinate of the vectors @xmath82 and @xmath74 respectively ; @xmath83e.g.,@xmath84 for the case of nuclear spin @xmath85 @xmath86 is the population factor for the state @xmath87    generally , in the low frequency external electrical field @xmath88 @xmath89 the population factor @xmath86 can change .",

    "@xmath93the time @xmath90 is large enough in comparison with the field oscillation period @xmath91.@xcite accordingly , the relaxation rate of tls @xmath94 is so small that the population of energy levels can not follow the rapidly changing field @xmath95 for this reason , the population factor remains approximately field independent.@xcite therefore , the contribution of the second term to permittivity in eq.([eq : chi_1 ] ) ( usually called a relaxational contribution ) vanishes .",
    "so the permittivity is only due to the first term in eq.([eq : chi_1 ] ) called a resonant contribution .",

    "changes can occur only if the quadrupole interaction exists .",
    "below we argue that , in the absence of the magnetic field , the correction @xmath9 to permittivity caused by the nuclear quadrupole interaction is associated with tunneling systems having @xmath109 @xmath110    the net quadrupole effect can be described by the difference of two permittivities @xmath111 one given by eq .",

    "( [ no6.01 ] ) taken at the value @xmath112 @xmath113 in fact , it is impossible to _ `` turn off '' _ the quadrupole interaction to experimentally investigate how the quadrupole interaction influences the permittivity , if any .",
    "a very strong magnetic filed should inhibit the quadrupole effect @xcite this is due to the fact that the strong magnetic field creates identical local eigen states , characterized by a certain nuclear spin projection onto the magnetic field in the wells .",
    "thus , the influence of the quadrupole effect on the permittivity can be verified experimentally by measuring the difference @xmath114 where @xmath3 is the zeeman splitting of nuclear spin energy levels by the external magnetic field .",
    "the permittivity of the tunneling system is completely defined by the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ master ] ) .",

    "the effect is observed at magnetic field about three orders of magnitude smaller.@xcite the reason for this effect is not clear .",
