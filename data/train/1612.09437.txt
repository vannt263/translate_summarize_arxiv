    "the spin - boson model ( sbm ) is a frequently used paradigm to study the influence of the environmental noise on the quantum evolution of a two - level system  @xcite . the noise - induced dissipation and",
    "dephasing is the central issue of a variety of research fields , ranging from the electron / energy transfer in bio - chemical systems @xcite to the endeavour of building a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "sufficiently strong coupling to the bosonic bath also induces a localize - delocalize quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in the two - level system @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial universality class of this qpt receives much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "experimental realization of the sbm have been proposed in various contexts , ranging from the mesoscopic metal ring to cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "the conventional sbm , composed of a quantum spin linearly coupled to the displacement operator of a group of harmonic oscillators , belongs to the quantum impurity problem where the properties of the impurity is determined by the ( infinitely ) many degrees of freedom in the bath , but the influence of the impurity on the bath is negligibly small .",
    "recently , much attention is paid to the quantum two - level system quadratically coupled to a bosonic environment .",
    "such a problem arises in various qubit systems , including the superconducting qubit @xcite , semiconductor quantum dot @xcite , and the bismuth donors in silicon @xcite , where the linear qubit - environment coupling is tuned to zero to suppress the decoherence and the remaining leading order coupling is quadratic .",
    "significant enhancement of the coherence time has been achieved at such an optimal working point .",
    "theoretical studies have been carried out to understand the influence of the quadratic coupling on the dephasing of the qubit  @xcite . in the quantum dot - based qubit systems ,",

    "_ suggested that the quadratic couplings leads to the anomalous diffusion of the particle  @xcite .",
    "as for the linear - coupling sbm , previous studies of the quadratic - coupling sbm focused mainly on the influence of the environment on the quantum two - level systems",
    ". however , in striking contrast to the linear - coupling case , the non - linearity of the spin - boson coupling makes the feedback effect of the impurity to the bath no longer negligible .",
    "especially , the coupling quadratic in the coordinate of the environmental bosons will shift the boson energies and lead to new phenomenon such as the the softening of the environmental bosons . in this paper , we show that a strong quadratic coupling can even induce a qpt in the environment and qualitatively change the bath . at the qpt ,",
    "the environmental bosons become unstable with inverted harmonic potentials . considering higher order anharmonic potentials",
    ", this will lead to a local distortion in the environment as the new state .",
    "we find that the ground state phase diagram includes both the first - order and continuous qpts . as a consequence of the qpt , the quantum dynamics of both the spin and the bath are severely changed , at and away from the qpts .",
    "this makes such qpts an indispensable ingredient to consider in the study of the above - stated systems",

    "the environmental stable - unstable transition exists any more . instead , similar to the situation of linear - coupling sbm under a finite bias @xmath9 , it is expect that the ground state smoothly interpolates between different limiting symmetry - broken states of purely linear- or quadratic - coupling hamiltonians .",
