    "alignment has attracted much attention in recent years , which was introduced by maddah - ali _ et al_. @xcite-@xcite for the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) x channel and subsequently by cadambe and jafar @xcite in the context of the @xmath0-user interference channel ( ic ) .",
    "the basic idea of ia is to align multiple interfering signals at each receiver in order to reduce the effective interference .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that up to @xmath1 total degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) is achievable .",
    "while the huge potential benefits can be achieved via ia , several challenges must be overcome before these benefits translated into practice .",
    "one key issue is the assumption of global channel state information ( gcsi ) at each node which is assumed in most papers .",
    "while a node may acquire csi for its own channels , it is much harder to learn the channels between other pairs of nodes with which this node is not directly associated . to eliminate the gcsi assumption ,",
    "an iterative interference alignment ( iia ) algorithm was proposed in @xcite based on channel reciprocity to align interference in a distributed fashion .",
    "however , the overhead induced by long iterations can overwhelm the gain achieved by ia @xcite .    in this letter , based on the closed - form ia solutions in @xcite ,",
    "a low overhead distributed interference alignment ( loia ) scheme is proposed for the @xmath0-user single - input single - out ( siso ) ic , and extension to multiple antenna scenario is also considered . the overhead of our loia scheme is greatly reduced compared with the iia algorithm .",
    "simulation results show that the iia algorithm is strictly suboptimal compared with our loia algorithm in the overhead - limited scenario .",
    "we have noticed that concurrent work was developed in @xcite based on the close - form solutions in @xcite .",
    "however , their scheme is specially designed for fdd scenario where much overhead and delay are incurred while our scheme is based on the channel reciprocity in tdd scenario .",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite , @xcite that ia is impractical when applied to many users in the ic simultaneously .",
    "so , we are more interested in the 3-user ic .",
    "consider the @xmath0-user time - varying or frequency - selective ic consisting of @xmath0 transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "each node is equipped with one antenna ( multiple antenna scenario is considered later ) .",
    "the received signal at receiver @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 } = \\sum^k_{j=1 } \\textbf{h}^{[kj ] } { x}^{[j ] } + { z}^{[k]},\\ ] ] where @xmath4}$ ] is an @xmath5 vector that represents the transmitted signal of user @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the number of symbol extension of the channel in time or frequency .",

    "the iia algorithm was proposed in @xcite by utilizing the reciprocity of wireless channel .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the relationship between the number of iterations and the interference leakage power per user .",
    "we can see that long iterations are needed before data transmission began .",
    "the overhead induced by the iterations can overwhelm the gain achieved by ia @xcite .",
    "in this section , a low overhead distributed interference alignment ( loia ) scheme is proposed based on the close - form solutions in @xcite .",
    "we describe the loia algorithm for the 3-user siso ic in detail .",
    "extension to the @xmath0-user siso ic can be realized based on appendix iii in @xcite . for a limited space ,",
    "we will not repeat it here .",
    "we show that @xmath17 } , d^{[2 ] } , d^{[3 ] } \\ } = \\ { n+1 , n , n \\}$ ] data streams can be sent simultaneously over a @xmath18 symbol extension in a distributed fashion .",
