    "some of the most difficult problems that must be reconciled with the theory are :    the magnitude of the dipole of the angular distribution of optically selected galaxies ( lahav et al . 1988 ; kaiser & lahav 1989 ) ;    the possible observations of clusters of galaxies with high velocity dispersion at @xmath0 ( evrard 1989 ) ;    the strong clustering of rich clusters of galaxies , @xmath1 , far in excess of cdm predictions ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) ;    the x - ray temperature distribution function of clusters , over - producing the observed clusters abundances ( bartlett & silk 1993 ) ;    the conflict between the normalization of the spectrum of the perturbation which is required by different types of observations ;    the incorrect scale dependence of the galaxy correlation function , @xmath2 , on scales @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5 , having @xmath2 too little power on the large scales compared to the power on smaller scales ( maddox et al . 1990a ; saunders et al .",

    "the mass of a rich cluster is approximately @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , being @xmath8 the hubble constant at current epoch ( in the paper we adopt @xmath9 ) .",
    "this mass comes from a region of diameter @xmath10 and consequently the observations of clusters can provide information on the mass distribution of the universe on these scales .",
    "furthermore , since rich clusters are rare objects , their properties are expected to be sensitive to the underlying mass density field from which they arose . on scales of @xmath10 the density field",
    "is still described by the linear perturbation theory so the measurement at the present epoch can be related to the initial conditions . while the gravitational mass in bound objects is easily computed using analytic approaches such as the ps formalism or n - body simulations , it is not so easily measured",
    "the most robust measurements of the clusters abundance currently rely on the clusters temperature function , that is the number density of clusters above a certain temperature @xmath11 expressed in units of @xmath12 mpc@xmath13",
    ". the reasons of this choice are several .",
    "the integrated temperature does not suffer from projection effects , and complete samples of clusters may be obtained from all sky x - ray surveys .",
    "clusters are close to isothermal , both observationally and in simulations , which makes their temperature determination robust and insensitive to numerical resolution or telescope angular resolution .",
    "the temperature of a cluster depends primarily on the depth of the potential well of the dark matter , and the state of equilibrium of the gas .",
    "this is in contrast to the clusters luminosity , which depends strongly on small scale parameters like clumping and core radius .",
    "+ the clusters abundance is one of the best observables available for determining the density field .",
    "in fact , according to the gravitational instability scenario , galaxies and clusters form where the density contrast , @xmath14 , is large enough so that the surrounding matter can separate from the general expansion and collapse .",
    "consequently the abundance of collapsed objects depends on the amplitude of the density perturbations . in the cdm model",
    "these latter follow a gaussian probability distribution and their amplitude on a scale @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 , the r.m.s .",
    "value of @xmath14 , which is related to the power spectrum , @xmath17 . in hierarchical models of structure formation , like cdm",
    ", @xmath16 decreases with increasing scale , @xmath15 , and consequently the density contrast required to form large objects , like clusters of galaxies , rarely occurs .",
    "the present abundance of clusters is then extremely sensitive to small change in the spectrum , @xmath17 .",
    "moreover the rate of clusters evolution is strictly connected to the density parameter , @xmath18 . then clusters abundance and its evolution",

    "the temperatures are easily and well determined .",
    "they also constructed temperature distributions that has been compared with the cdm predicted x - ray temperature distribution function ( bartlett & silk 1993 ) . using this data it was shown that galaxy clusters are too numerous in the cdm scenario ( bartlett & silk 1993 ) .",
    "+ the other problem of the cdm model that we are addressing is that of the discrepancy between the two - point correlation function of clusters of galaxies and the observed one .",
    "+ measurements of galaxy clustering on large scales ( maddox et al 1990a ; efstathiou et al . 1990b ; saunders et al .",
    "1991 ) revealed rms fluctuations of the order of 50% within spheres of radius 20@xmath22 .",
    "these amplitudes , relative to non - linear clustering on scales 5@xmath22 , are 2 - 3 times larger than that predicted by the cdm model . at first the suggestion of excess power",

    "( 1987 ) , the cluster correlations in _ standard _ cold dark matter ( scdm ) should have an amplitude 2 - 3 times smaller than these estimates .",

    "1992 ) , x - ray clusters samples ( lahav et al . 1989 ) have a large correlation length and observations of bright radio galaxies ( peacock 1991 ; peacock & nicholson 1991 ) are also strongly clustered on large scales .",
    "+ finally , as shown in some studies of galaxy clustering on large scales ( maddox et al . 1990a ; efstathiou et al . 1990b ; saunders et al . 1991 ) , the measured rms fluctuations within spheres of radius @xmath23 have values 2 - 3 times larger than that predicted by the cdm model . in order to solve the quoted discrepancies between cdm model previsions and observations ,",
    "alternative models have been introduced .",
    "several authors ( peebles 1984 ; efstathiou et al . 1990a ; turner 1991 ) have lowered the matter density under the critical value ( @xmath24 ) and have added a cosmological constant in order to retain a flat universe ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "the normalisation of the transfer function begins to fall , even if its shape is retained .",
    "in particular bartlett & silk ( 1993 ) showed that a model with @xmath31 and @xmath32 produces a reasonable temperature distribution of clusters , but a higher normalization with @xmath33 , ( where @xmath34 is the rms value of @xmath35 in a sphere of @xmath36mpc ) , is needed to explain the peculiar velocity field ( efstathiou et al . 1992b ) .",

    "in particular the model with @xmath37 simulated by davis et al ( 1992 ) , gives a good reproduction of the clusters abundance with a normalization within the 1 @xmath38 errors of the cobe .",
    "these last models have some difficulty in reproducing peculiar velocities ( efstathiou et al .",
    "+ alternatively , changing the primeval spectrum , several problems of cdm are solved ( cen et al . 1992 ) .",
    "finally it is possible to assume that the threshold for galaxy formation is not spatially invariant but weakly modulated ( @xmath39 on scales @xmath40 ) by large scale density fluctuations , with the result that the clustering on large - scale is significantly increased ( bower et al .",
    "this model follows the spirit of the well known high - peak model but differs from it because nonlocal physical processes produce different shapes of the mass and galaxy correlation function .",

    "2 , in the ps theory the comoving number density of non - linear objects of mass @xmath43 to @xmath168 is simply obtained by differentiating with respect to mass the integral from @xmath159 to infinity of the probability distribution for fluctuations given by : @xmath169=\\frac 1{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma ( m)}\\exp [ -\\delta ( m)^2/2\\sigma ( m)^2 ] \\label{eq : pip}\\ ] ] in an exactly analogous way , the probability @xmath170 per unit volume per unit masses of finding two collapsed objects of mass @xmath171 and @xmath172 separated by a distance @xmath90 is obtained by integrating both variables of the bivariant gaussian distribution in @xmath173 and @xmath174 , with correlation @xmath175 from @xmath45 to infinity and then taking the partial derivatives with respect to both masses . the correlation function for collapsed objects",
    "is simply obtained from : @xmath176 which for equal masses and on scales bigger than that of the turn - around ( @xmath177 ) is ( kashlinsky 1987 ) : @xmath178\\xi _ \\rho ( r )   \\label{eq : coo}\\ ] ] where @xmath179 is the correlation function of the matter density distribution when the density fluctuations had small amplitude .",
    "( [ eq : coo ] ) shows that the correlation of collapsed objects may be enhanced with respect to the underlying mass fluctuations .",
    "this condition is usually described by the bias parameter @xmath59 which is sometimes defined as @xmath180^{1/2}=\\delta_{c}/\\sigma(m)$ ] .",
    "+ studies of clustering on scales @xmath181 have shown that the correlation function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coo ] ) is different from that obtained from observations .",
    "the most compelling data are angular correlation functions for the apm survey .",
    "these decline much less rapidly on large scales than the cdm prediction ( maddox et al .",
    "this discrepancy can be reduced taking into account the non - radial motions that originate when a cluster reaches the non - linear regime .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the correlation function requires the specification of @xmath45 which is modified by non - radial motions .",
    "+ the result of our calculation is showed in fig .",
    "3 . + the observational data to which we compare the calculated correlation function are those obtained by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) from the analysis of huchra s et al .",
    "( 1990 ) deep redshift survey as discussed in geller & huchra ( 1988 ) and the data points for the apm clusters computed by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992a ) .    the deep - cluster redshift survey of huchra et al .",
    "( 1990 ) consists of the 145 abell clusters with @xmath182 , @xmath183 in the area @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "the apm sample consists of 240 clusters with apm richness @xmath186 and photometrically derived redshifts @xmath187 .",
    "the survey covers a solid angle @xmath188 in the region of sky @xmath189 , @xmath190 of the apm galaxy survey . both in sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) and efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992a ) the correlation function was calculated from the samples using the estimator : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the numbers of cluster pairs and cluster - random pairs having redshift - space separations in the range ( @xmath194,@xmath195 ) .",
    "the random points are generated within the sample volume with a mean density f times that of the clusters and with a redshift distribution derived from a smoothed distribution of the redshifts for the cluster sample .",
    "the correlation function obtained was finally corrected for line - of - sight anisotropies .",
    "this correction is necessary because the clustering of abell clusters is highly anisotropic in redshift space , providing evidence that the abell catalogues , which were built by scanning photographic plates by eye , are affected by incompleteness on the plane of the sky which enhances the clustering amplitude measured in three dimensions ( sutherland & efstathiou 1991 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "in particular efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992a ) presented a clear example of incompleteness in the abell @xmath182 catalogue comparing the machine - based apm survey with the postman , hucra & geller 1992 redshift survey of abell clusters showing that even if the clusters in these surveys have comparable space densities the red - shift space correlation function of the apm sample is isotropic on large scales while the correlation function for the abell clusters is highly anisotropic . in any case , after this correction the correlation function of abell clusters agrees extremely well with that of apm clusters ( efstathiou et al .",
    "we use two samples because : + a ) we wanted to compare our model for the two - point correlation function with observational data and at the same time with the result obtained by borgani ( 1990 ) who studied the effect of particular thresholds ( erfc - threshold and gaussian - threshold ) on the correlation properties of clusters of galaxies and compared his result with that by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) . for this reason we used this last sample ; + 2 ) we used the apm galaxy survey because the uniformity of the apm magnitudes , the low obscuration in the apm survey area and the use , for its construction , of a computer cluster - finding algorithm ( see maddox et al .",
    "1990a , b ) further reduce the possibility of spurious clustering on the plane of the sky . + the comparison between the correlation function and the quoted data , displayed in fig .",
    "3 , shows that there is an evident discrepancy between pure cdm previsions and experimental data .",
    "the cdm model seems to have trouble in re - producing the behaviour of the data .",
    "in fact , the predicted two - point cluster function is too steep and rapidly goes nearly to zero for @xmath196 , while the data show no significant anticorrelation up to @xmath197 ( see borgani 1990 ) .",
    "this is a direct effect due to the non - scale invariance of the cdm spectrum ( primack & blumenthal 1983 ) . the introduction of non - radial motions gives a more accurate description of the experimental data showing that physical effects can not be ignored in the study of the formation of cosmic structures .",
    "the result obtained is in agreement with that obtained by borgani ( 1990 ) who showed how the introduction of smooth thresholds ( similar to that obtained in our model ) leads to two - point correlation functions in a systematically agreement with the data . before",
    "going on we want to remember that the threshold functions are strictly connected to the concept of bias .",
    "in fact , according to the biased theory of galaxy formation , observable objects of mass @xmath198 arise from fluctuations of the density field , filtered on a scale @xmath15 , rising over a _",
    "threshold , @xmath199 , where @xmath38 is the rms value of @xmath14 and @xmath200 is the threshold height .",
    "the number density of objects,@xmath201 , that forms from peaks of density of height @xmath202 can be written following bbks ( 1986 ) in the form : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the threshold function , @xmath200 the threshold height and @xmath205 the differential number density of peaks ( see bbks 1986 eq .",
    "the threshold level @xmath200 is defined so that the probability of a peak becoming an observable object is @xmath206 when @xmath207 . in the sharp threshold case",
    "the selection function , is a heaviside function @xmath208 .",
    "as previously quoted the threshold function is connected to the bias coefficient of a class of objects by ( bbks ) : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is : @xmath211 t(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{t } } ) n_{pk}(\\nu ) d\\nu   \\label{eq : nu}\\ ] ] while , @xmath212 and @xmath213 are given in bbks ( 1986 ) ( respectively eq .",
    "4.6 a ; eq . 6.14 ) .",
    "+ while in a @xmath130 threshold scheme , fluctuations below @xmath159 have zero probability to develop an observable object and fluctuations above @xmath159 have zero probability not to develop an object , the situation is totally different when an erfc - threshold , as that introduced by borgani ( 1990 ) , is used . in this case",
    "objects can also be formed from fluctuations below @xmath159 and there is a non - zero probability for fluctuations above @xmath159 to be sterile . + according with borgani ( 1990 ) ,",
    "the erfc - threshold can be related to non - sphericity effects during the gravitational growing process .",
    "in fact , while in the spherical limit it is possible to find a precise relation between the time , @xmath131 elapsed from the turning around and the correspondent density contrast , @xmath14,(@xmath214 ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , when non - sphericity is introduced it is no longer possible to univocally relate the primeval density contrast and the evolutionary stage of a fluctuation because while in the spherical model an object is characterized by @xmath215 the non - sphericity produces a spread around the typical value @xmath159 .",
    "the erfc - threshold is a way to correct the quoted @xmath216 relation .",
    "the erfc - threshold is also linked to non - radial motions .",
    "in fact as we previously told , the tidal interaction of the irregular mass distribution within and around the protocluster , present in hierarchical models , gives rise to non - radial motions .",
    "we also told that the erfc - threshold is related to non - sphericity effects that in turn are responsible for the origin of the quoted non - radial motions .",
    "+ borgani s ( 1990 ) model , like our , is characterized by a non-@xmath130 threshold . as we showed in a previous paper , del popolo & gambera 1998a ,",
    "one of the effects of non - radial motions is that the threshold function differs from a heaviside function ( sharp threshold ) , ( see fig .",
    "7 of del popolo & gambera 1998a ) . in this last paper",
    "the threshold function is defined as : @xmath217 d\\delta \\label{eq : sel}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath218 =   \\frac 1{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma_{\\overline{\\delta } } } \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{|\\overline{\\delta } - \\langle \\overline{\\delta } ( r ) \\rangle|^2}{2\\sigma _ { \\overline{\\delta } } ^2}\\right ) \\label{eq : gau}\\ ] ] gives the probability that the peak overdensity is different from the average , in a gaussian density field .",
    "as displayed , the integrand is evaluated at a radius @xmath219 which is the typical radius of the object that we are selecting . moreover",
    ", the threshold function @xmath220 depends on the critical overdensity threshold for the collapse , @xmath221 , which is not constant as in a spherical model ( due to the presence , in our analysis , of non - radial motions that delay the collapse of the proto - cluster ) ( see eq . ( [ eq : ma7 ] ) ) . the fundamental difference between our and borgani",
    "s approach is that our threshold function is physically motivated : it is simply obtained from the assumptions of a gaussian density field and taking account of non - radial motions .",
    "borgani s threshold functions ( erfc and gaussian threshold ) are ad - hoc introduced in order to reduce the discrepancy between the observed and the cdm predicted two - point correlation functions of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the connection with the quoted non - sphericity effects , even if logical and in agreement with our results , is only a posteriori tentative to justify the choice made .",
    "in these last years many authors ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; white et al . 1987 ; maddox et al . 1990a",
    "; saunders et al . 1991 ; peacock 1991 ; bartlett & silk 1993 ) have shown the existence of a strong discrepancy between the observed x - ray temperature distribution function of clusters and that predicted by a cdm model and the observed two - point correlation function of clusters and that predicted by the cdm model . to reduce these discrepancies several alternative models",
    "have been introduced but no model has considered the role of the non - radial motions . here",
    "we have shown how non - radial motions may reduce both the two quoted discrepancies . to this aim",
    "we calculated the variation in the treshold parameter , @xmath222 , as a function of the mass @xmath43 , and that of the temperature - mass relation , produced by the presence of non - radial motions in the outskirts of clusters of galaxies .",
    "we compared edge et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) data with the distribution function of x - ray temperature , calculated using ps ( 1974 ) theory and evrard s ( 1990 ) prescriptions for the mass - temperature relation .",
    "we found that the model produces a reasonable clusters temperature distribution ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . we also used @xmath223 to calculate the two - point correlation of clusters of galaxies and we compared it both with that obtained by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) from the analysis of huchra s et al .",
