    "dark energy , the component responsible for the late time acceleration of our universe , is currently well described by a cosmological constant in the @xmath0cdm concordance model .",
    "@xmath0cdm has been very successful in explaining a large range of observations probing a vast range in length scales , but from a theoretical point of view the model suffers from the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "this has led to more general models for dark energy .",
    "scalar field models have been particularly popular over the last decade , and are predicted to exist in many theories of high energy physics , like string theory and supergravity ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , many of the dark energy models that have been constructed so far suffer from problems akin to the ones they are trying to solve or introduce new issues themselves .",
    "at best they can be treated as low energy field theories valid well below the electron mass , corresponding to the very late phase of the universe .",
    "hence these models need to be embedded in a better defined theory whose ultra violet behaviour is under control . so far ,",
    "no such complete scenario has been constructed .",
    "dark energy models also seem to require the existence of a very light scalar field whose coupling to matter leads to a long ranged fifth force whose presence is at odds with current gravitational tests .",
    "screening mechanisms @xcite have been invoked in order to alleviate this problem .",
    "axion - like particles with derivative couplings to matter are also possible candidates @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it could well be that the dark sector of the universe , composed of the still undiscovered cold dark matter ( cdm ) and dark energy ( de ) , could be described by a globally supersymmetric theory @xcite .",
    "in such a case the vanishingly small amount of dark energy which is necessary to generate the acceleration of the universe could result from a small cosmological breaking of supersymmetry due to the non - zero cdm energy density .",
    "such a scenario would naturally lead to a close relationship between the dark energy and the cdm energy densities .",
    "of course , one should also ensure that corrections to the globally supersymmetric scalar potential coming from the soft supersymmetry breaking in the mssm sector do not spoil the cdm - de correspondence and the properties of the scalar potential in the late time universe .",
    "recently @xcite , such a supersymmetric model of dark energy coupled to cold dark matter , the supersymmetron , was proposed by two of us . in the absence of cold dark matter , the supersymmetron converges to a supersymmetric minimum with a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "when cold dark matter is present , the supersymmetron evolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish and can contribute to the dark energy budget of the universe .",
    "the supersymmetron generates a short ranged fifth force between the cdm and the de which evades gravitational tests , but could lead to observable signatures on structure formation as found in similar modified gravity theories @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the cosmological evolution of the supersymmetron at the background level and the evolution of dark matter perturbations in the linear and non - linear regime .",
    "the non - linear regime is studied by using spherical collapse . due to the highly non - linear behaviour of the field during the spherical collapse we are able to extract constraints on the model parameters , which are then used to constrain the background cosmology .",
    "the spherical collapse model has been previously used in models with a simple yukawa - type modification of gravity , in the so - called @xmath1 / chameleon models @xcite , in brane - world cosmologies @xcite and in models which allow for dark energy fluctuations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we find that a cosmological constant ( cc ) must be included in the model and that linear perturbations do not deviate from their @xmath0cdm counterparts . on the other hand ,",
    "non - linear effects are significant on astrophysical scales .",

    "the angular field @xmath13 is stabilised at this minimum with a mass which is always much greater than the gravitino mass @xcite implying that @xmath14 in the rest of this paper we will write @xmath3 instead of @xmath15 for simplicity .",

    "( [ lambdaeq ] ) as @xmath217 from eq .",
    "( [ phimineq ] ) we find @xmath218 by using eq .",
    "( [ scaleseq ] ) we get @xmath219 from which we find @xmath220    the simplest case to analyze is @xmath221 for which the scale @xmath222 vanishes from the theory .",
    "we find @xmath223 i.e. @xmath224 needs to be between the current hubble scale and the dark energy scale .",
    "this scale can be elevated by increasing the redshift @xmath225 , but we typically need a redshift in the very early universe to reach super - tev scales . for @xmath226",
    "we find @xmath227 in the general case @xmath228 we see from eq .",
    "( [ scales ] ) that taking @xmath229 together with @xmath230 can serve to increase the other two scales . for example",
    "@xmath231 and @xmath232 gives @xmath233 which is around the dark energy scale .",
    "there seems to be no unfine - tuned way of bringing these mass - scales up to typical particle physics scales if we want the cosmological symmetry breaking to be close to the present era .",
    "for example to have @xmath234 tev when @xmath122 and @xmath235 then eq .  ( [ scales ] ) shows that we need @xmath236 which translates to @xmath237 .    finally and from a field",
    "theoretic point of view , the scale @xmath222 has a different status from @xmath238 .",
    "the former appears in the khler potential as a suppression of scales for higher dimensional operators and signals the typical scales above which the effective field theory description breaks down . on the contrary , @xmath238 appear in the superpotential and are protected by non - renormalisation theorems .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath222 should be sensitive to high energy physics and represents the effective cut - off of the theory . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath238 may be already present at very high energy even if these scales are very low .",
    "of course , this does not provide an explanation for the discrepancy of scales between @xmath222 and @xmath238 which is not natural .",
    "we have studied the cosmological evolution of the supersymmetron and its possible effects on structure formation . requiring that linear perturbations are in agreement with @xmath0cdm on large scales , we find that the energy density in the supersymmetron is negligible compared to the dark matter density and a pure cosmological constant",
    "must be introduced to play the role of dark energy .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the model was also investigated by using the spherical collapse model .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions to the field equation have been derived and used to predict the fifth - force effects on a collapsing halo .",
    "the effective gravitational constant at the edge of a spherical overdensity has been found to be much larger than the linear prediction due to the highly non - linear properties of the model .",
    "the model parameter must be tuned such that the spherical collapse is under control on large scales .",
    "this implies that linear perturbations reduce to that of @xmath0cdm . on non - linear scales",
    "the model then predicts a faster collapse than that of @xmath0cdm .",
    "in particular we find that the supersymmetron predicts an excess of small mass halos compared to @xmath0cdm .",
    "however for this to be the case , one or more of the mass - scales in the theory must be fine - tuned .",
    "on very small scales , i.e. galaxy - scales , the matter density is large enough to effectively screen the fifth - force via the chameleon mechanism .",
    "this non - linear regime could in principle be probed using n - body simulations . however , due to the enormous mass of the field this poses a severe challenge for existing methods .",
