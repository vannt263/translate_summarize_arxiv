    "recent experiments on frustrated quantum magnets with unusual properties @xcite has revived interest in spin liquid phases . at the same time",
    "the theoretical understanding of spin liquid phases in @xmath5 has also matured over the last few years - for example it is now established that such states are typically accompanied by emergent gauge fields in their deconfined phase .",
    "simple and tractable lattice hamiltonians that realize these phases can also be constructed .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a pressing need to understand the situations in which microscopic spin models might exhibit such phases , and the variety of such phases and their phenomenological properties .",
    "the triangular lattice antiferromagnet has been considered a good place to look for such spin liquid states , its geometry is considered less conducive to magnetic order than for example the square lattice antiferromagnet , and more recently there has been evidence from numerical calculations @xcite especially in the presence of anisotropic interactions and ring exchange , for unconventional physics .",
    "similarly , recent experiments on quantum magnets with a triangular lattice structure - cs@xmath6cucl@xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8-(et)@xmath6cu(cn)@xmath9@xcite and @xmath10he films adsorbed on graphite@xcite show unusual properties that may be interpreted in terms of spin liquid phases or proximity to such a state . while the spin gapped @xmath0 spin liquid states considered in this paper are probably not appropriate to directly describe these experimental systems , except perhaps at the very lowest temperatures , they motivate a closer study of possible spin liquid states on the triangular lattice .",
    "the highly frustrated kagom lattice has long been considered a good system for realizing exotic ground states . while there are fewer experimentally well studied examples of quantum spins on the kagom lattice , conventional semiclassical analysis fails to produce a unique ground state when applied to this frustrated lattice .",
    "hence , spin disordered states like spin liquids may be realized .    in describing spin liquid states of quantum magnets , two distinct approaches",
    "have been found to be useful .",
    "the first involves writing the quantum spin ( e.g. spin-1/2 ) as a fermion bilinear ( fermionic spinons ) , and imposing a constraint on the total number of fermions on each site .",
    "this fermionic approach is analytically pursued by writing down a mean field ansatz where the constraint is imposed only on average to begin with .",
    "this mean field theory may also be viewed as a source of variational wave - functions , which after projection yields spin wave functions .",
    "an important step in understanding the variety of spin liquid states possible in this representation was taken by wen and collaborators@xcite who introduced the projective symmetry group ( psg ) classification of spin liquids that respect the microscopic symmetries of the system .",
    "this provides a guide to identifying the correct gauge group describing the spin liquid ( if it survives projection ) and also allows for a further classification of different spin liquid phases with the same gauge group .",
    "these different spin liquid phases differ in subtle ways from one another , for example in terms of the location of the wavevector of their lowest energy spin-1 excitation .",
    "the advantage of such classification is that it allows for an exploration of possible spin liquid states independent of specific hamiltonians that might realize them as ground states . in this way",
    "the symmetric spin liquid states within the fermionic spin representation on the square and triangular lattices were classified @xcite .",
    "a different way to describe spin liquids is via the schwinger boson approach , where the spin operator is written as a boson bilinear ( bosonic spinons ) and was analyzed using a large - n approach @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it is able to readily access both spin liquid states as well as conventional magnetically ordered states , which arise from the condensation of the schwinger bosons .",
    "for instance , in the case of the triangular lattice@xcite , sachdev found a spin liquid state which on decreasing the strength of quantum fluctuations to the size expected for s=1/2 , gave way to the 120 degree magnetically ordered state , expected of classical spins on this lattice .",
    "however the possibility of other schwinger boson spin liquid states on the triangular lattice have not been systematically explored .",
    "similarly , on the kagom lattice , sachdev @xcite found two solutions , which on spinon condensation gives rise to @xmath3 or the @xmath2 magnetically ordered states .",
    "mapping out the possible spin liquid states on these lattices is of interest for two reasons .",
    "first , when attempting to identify a candidate spin liquid state to match with experimental data or numerical simulations , one needs to specify precisely what the nature of the state is , and the quantum numbers of its excitations .",
    "therefore while the simplest spin liquid may fail to match these details , other spin liquid states may give different predictions .",
    "second , there may exist solutions stabilized with different interactions which remain spin liquids even for physical values of the spin",
    ". this would be particularly appealing as it would also provide direction to the search for spin liquid states .",
    "even when the system is in the ordered phase , if it is proximate to a critical point where spin liquid physics holds , it has been argued @xcite that finite energy and finite temperature signatures of this will be unusual and best described in terms of the spin liquid variables .",
    "therefore , a systematic investigation of the possible solutions of the schwinger bosons states is required on the lines of the psg analysis of the fermionic spin liquid states .",
    "this will also shed light on the connection between two approaches , for example , which states can be described in one but not the other approach .",
    "in this paper we will adapt the technique of projective symmetry groups , developed by wen and collaborators@xcite in the context of fermionic mean field theories to study schwinger boson mean field theories .",
    "we will focus on the triangular and kagom lattices , in particular on spin liquid states with the ising gauge group ( @xmath0 gauge theories ) which preserve the microscopic spin symmetries .",
    "surprisingly , the number is not large ( less than or equal to 8 for both lattices ) , which includes , in addition to the solution found by sachdev , a set of fundamentally different mean field wave functions , which give rise to @xmath0 spin liquids .",
    "in particular , if we make the further reasonable assumption of restricting to states with non - trivial nearest - neighbor bond amplitudes , there is only one other state on the triangular lattice , which we call the @xmath1-flux state .",
    "similarly , on the kagom lattice , @xmath0 spin liquid states with nonvanishing nearest neighbor bond amplitudes , include , in addition to the two states found by sachdev , two additional states , which we refer to as the [ @xmath1 hex,@xmath1 rhom ] and [ @xmath11 hex,@xmath1 rhom ] ( which specifies the flux in the length - six hexagonal loop , and the length - eight rhombus ) .",
    "one of the problems in searching for spin liquid states has been the tendency of various spin hamiltonians to yield magnetically order states , which is reflected in the small values of @xmath12 , the critical quantum parameter at which spin ordering occurs in the sachdev states : @xmath13 on the triangular , and @xmath14 for the kagom states in large - n@xcite .",
    "( note , @xmath15 in the case of spin @xmath16 but it is convenient to extend it to take on all real values ) .",
    "a feature of the new states that is their relative stability against magnetic order which is seen in the larger critical quantum parameter at which spin ordering occurs : @xmath17 for the pi - flux triangular state , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the two new kagom states respectively , in nearest neighbor models .",
    "while the distinct mean field solutions of the psg analysis are typically local minima of the mean field energy , an important question is whether they can be stabilized as global minima with appropriate interactions .",
    "this is discussed in detail for the case of the triangular lattice in this paper .",
    "while the zero - flux state is stabilized with just nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic spin couplings , introducing next neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings or ring exchange ( of the sign arising from the hubbard model ) both tend to favor the @xmath1-flux state .",
    "we obtain the conditions on the microscopic spin interactions which favor this state and argue that this may be a fruitful parameter regime for numerical searches for spin liquids .",
    "in general we find that ring exchange on even length loops ( with the sign as derived from the hubbard model ) , favors states with @xmath1 flux on length-@xmath20 loops , while it favors states with zero flux in length-(@xmath21 ) loops ( @xmath22 is positive integer ) .",
    "this is in contrast to fermionic case where ring exchange _ disfavors _ flux@xcite for fermions in all loops .",
    "addition or ring exchange on length-@xmath23 and length-@xmath24 loops can stabilize the [ @xmath11 hex,@xmath1 rhom ] state on the kagom , which is good spin liquid candidate since it has @xmath25 .    on spinon condensation",
    ", the triangular lattice @xmath1-flux state naturally leads to magnetically ordered states with wavevectors at the midpoints of the brillouin zone edges ( in contrast to the zero - flux state which leads to the 120 degree state with wavevector at the zone corners ) .",
    "this allows us to understand semi - classical ( large spin ) calculations in the presence of moderate - neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings or antiferromagnetic , ( with sign as obtained from the hubbard model ) ring exchange on the triangular lattice , where ordered states with the same wavevector are found .",
    "it is tempting to connect the possible ordered states on the triangular lattice as emerging from spin condensation out of the few schwinger boson spin liquid states allowed by the psg .",
    "new quantum transitions are expected on spinon condensation out of the spin liquid states obtained here , and will be the subject of future study .",
    "_ layout of the paper : _ in section  [ sec : sbmft ] we briefly review the schwinger boson mean field theory .",
    "section  [ sec : psg ] analyzes possible spin liquid states on the triangular lattice .",
    "it first reviews the projective symmetry group classification of spin liquid states and the strong constraints that arise from relations between symmetry group elements .",
    "this is then applied to schwinger boson states on the triangular lattice .",
    "a new state is found , the @xmath1-flux state , which is further analyzed - in particular spin configurations resulting from spinon condensation are described , and hamiltonians stabilizing this mean field solution are obtained .",
    "the general effect of ring exchange interactions on schwinger boson mean field states is discussed . in section [ sec : kagomepsg ] possible spin liquid states on the kagom lattice are studied , and the properties of one of them , which is unusually stable against spin ordering , is described in more detail .",
    "the psg analysis and other details are relegated to the appendices , which also contains analysis for other lattices of interest such as the anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "there are a variety of ways of formulating the schwinger boson mean field theory , for example , as a large - n approach @xcite , or as an approximate variational approach .    here",
    "we will formulate a variational approach that will provide us with a unified way to study the effect of different interactions .",
    "we write the spin hamiltonian :    h = j_1_ij _ i_j + j_2_ij _ i_j+[equ : spin_h ]    in terms of schwinger bosons :    _ i_j = 14 b_i _ , b_ib_j _ , b_j [ equ : spin_boson ]    with the constraint that at every site :    _ b_ib_i = [ equ : hardconstraint ]    where for a spin system with spin @xmath16 , @xmath15 . in the analysis",
    "below , it will be convenient to consider @xmath8 to be a continuous parameter , taking on any non - negative value .",
    "we now consider a variational approach to finding the ground states and excitations of ( [ equ : spin_h ] ) .",
    "motivated by the operator identity _",
    "i_j=:_ij_ij:-_ij_ijwhere @xmath26 is normal ordering , and operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 we consider a mean field  hamiltonian which is quadratic in terms of the schwinger bosons , @xmath30 where complex numbers @xmath31 are the parameters of the mean field ansatz .    in the large - n @xmath32 theory ,",
    "the mean field hamiltonian contains only the large - n generalization of the @xmath33 term .",
    "however , since both @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms are consistent with global @xmath35 symmetry ( global spin rotation symmetry ) they are both included in the current theory .",
    "the introduction of both terms can be found in gazza @xcite and many other papers @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is used to generate a variational wavefunction in terms of the variational parameters @xmath36 . in order to obtain a _",
    "wavefunction , we need to project @xmath37 into the constrained hilbert space where the total number of bosons at each site is exactly @xmath38 . strictly speaking one",
    "must evaluate variational energies after this projection step , using the spin hamiltonian ( [ equ : spin_h ] ) .",
    "this generalization of gutzwiller projection to schwinger boson has been studied by chen and collaborators@xcite . however , since this hard projection is not possible to implement analytically ( it is even difficult to do numerically ) we rely on a approximate strategy that forgoes implementing the constraint locally , but only on the average - i.e. we tune @xmath39 to ensure that : _ b_ib_i= [ equ : avgconstraint ] we then evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( [ equ : spin_boson ] ) , written out in terms of schwinger bosons ( [ equ : spin_boson ] ) using the variational wavefunction .",
    "the resulting variational energy is then minimized with respect to the variational parameters @xmath40 .",
    "this yields the self - consistent equations , _",
    "ij = a_ij,_ij = b_ij    when these self - consistent equations are satisfied , the variational(mean field ) energy is simply obtained by utilizing the following identity , _",
    "i_j = 32 ( b_ij^2 - a_ij^2 ) [ equ : sdots ] the effect of projection on energetics will be a topic of future study .",
    "we would like to classify schwinger boson mean field states available to us on the triangular lattice in terms of the distinct spin liquid phases they can give rise to .",
    "this exercise allows us to readily obtain potentially interesting states relevant to quantum spin systems on the triangular lattice .",
    "interactions that stabilize these states are discussed subsequently .",
    "this classification follows the classification of fermionic mean field states in @xcite .",
    "here however the underlying local transformation is @xmath41 ( not @xmath35 as in the case of fermions ) . for mean",
    "field theories that survive projection ( or equivalently , survive fluctuations ) to give rise to a spin liquid state , this procedure classifies the distinct quantum phases of the system .",
    "we will require that the mean field theory reflects the underlying microscopic symmetries of the spin model .",
    "this leads to symmetric spin liquid states .",
    "the symmetry transformations include the space group ( lattice translations and point group symmetries ) of the triangular lattice , spin rotation symmetry and time reversal symmetry .",
    "the novel ingredient here is that the mean field state may preserve these symmetries in some indirect way .",
    "in addition to the symmetries of the original spin model , one also finds an extra global symmetry in all the mean field ansatz which is a subset of the local @xmath41 transformations mentioned previously .",
    "this is called the invariant gauge group ( igg ) in the terminology of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in mean field states that have exactly the same symmetry as the underlying spin model , not less or more , this is to be identified with the gauge group of the emergent gauge theory . in the examples below we will find an extra @xmath0 symmetry in the mean field ansatz ,",
    "hence the spin liquids that are obtained with this procedure are @xmath0 spin liquids , but with different internal structures depending on how the microscopic symmetries of the lattice model are realized .",
    "thus , in contrast to conventional states which are distinguished by patterns of broken symmetry , spin liquid phases that are completely symmetric and even share the same gauge group can be further distinguished in terms of how the symmetries are realized .    in schwinger boson representation of spins , there is a local @xmath41 transformation of bosons : b_e^()b _ [ equ : localu1 ] which leaves all physical observables unchanged . under this transformation ,",
    "our mean field ansatz ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) also transform :    @xmath44    two mean field ansatz that are related by such a transformation , give rise to the same spin wave function after projection . however , we will be interested in a class of transformations that leave the mean field ansatz _ invariant_. naively , one might expect that since we are interested in states that maintain all the microscopic symmetries , the mean field ansatz should be invariant under their operation ( _ e.g. _ lattice translations ) . while this is a sufficient condition for invariance ,",
    "it is not a necessary one , due to the presence of the local @xmath41 transformations described above .",
    "a symmetry operation might return the ansatz to a @xmath41 transformed form which would suffice , since the same spin wavefunction will be obtained on projection .",
    "hence symmetry transformations that leave the ansatz invariant in general will contain the naive transformation combined with a local @xmath41 transformation .",
    "the set of all transformations that leave a mean ansatz invariant is called the _ projective symmetry group ( psg ) _ @xcite . in principle",
    ", we would like to associate each and every element of this group with a physical symmetry .",
    "this is because if the mean field ansatz is to be a faithful representation of the microscopic physics , it should have exactly as much symmetry as the original model .",
    "however , we always find that there are some elements of the psg that are pure local transformation of the kind ( [ equ : localu1 ] ) .",
    "the set of such elements also forms a group ( a subgroup of the psg ) and is called the invariant gauge group ( igg ) .",
    "these can not be the result of a physical symmetry .",
    "it is therefore natural to associate these elements with the emergent gauge group that describes the spin liquid phase obtained ( if the mean field state survives projection ) . therefore the first step is to identify the igg of a mean field ansatz .",
    "the invariant gauge group for schwinger boson mean field theories : _ a general schwinger boson mean field hamiltonian with explicit global @xmath35 symmetry ( global spin rotation symmetry ) must be of the form of equation ( [ equ : mfhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are both nonzero the igg must be a @xmath0 group .",
    "the only two elements of igg are identity operation @xmath45 and the igg generator @xmath46 .",
    "this can be seen by considering only one bond .",
    "note , that if @xmath43 are nonzero while all @xmath42 vanish , the igg will be a @xmath41 group : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a site - independent constant .",
    "however it is unlikely for this ansatz to describe an antiferromagnet according to ( [ equ : sdots ] ) .",
    "finally we should consider the case with only non - vanishing @xmath42 . on a frustrated lattice the igg will still be the above @xmath0 group .",
    "however , if the lattice is bipartite , the igg will be a @xmath41 group : @xmath49 , where we apply opposite signs on the two sublattices .",
    "this is the case of simple square lattice .",
    "we will only consider psgs with @xmath0 igg in the following discussion .",
    "hence we are implicitly restricting ourselves to @xmath0 spin liquid states , which are the natural spin liquid states on frustrated lattices within the schwinger boson formalism .",
    "we consider mean field hamiltonian that preserves all of the physical symmetries in the psg sense ( symmetric spin liquid states ) .",
    "they are spin rotation symmetry , lattice space group symmetries and time reversal symmetry . the spin rotation symmetry is already implemented by considering mean field ansatz of the form ( [ equ : mfhamiltonian ] ) , which is explicitly invariant under global @xmath35 spin rotations .",
    "we will consider time reversal symmetry at the end of our derivation .",
    "the operations that we will now pay special attention to are the space group symmetries ( translations and point group operations for the triangular lattice ) . as discussed before , these can be implemented via combining the naive transformation with a local ( gauge ) @xmath41 transformation .",
    "one can ask the question - is it possible to have mean field ansatz with any choice of the gauge transformations ?",
    "it turns out that there are algebraic relations among the symmetry group elements that strongly constrain the possible choices of gauge transformations .",
    "thus , to obtain all possible psgs we should first check the algebraic structure of psgs without reference to a specific mean field ansatz .",
    "the possible psgs allowed by the algebra of the space group are defined as the _ algebraic psgs _ related to the space group .    for the isotropic triangular lattice ,",
    "the space group is generated by two translations @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one reflection @xmath52 in a bond and the 60 degree rotation @xmath53 about a lattice site .",
    "we use the following oblique coordinate system . in this system a site index @xmath54 has two integer components @xmath55 .",
    "oblique coordinates system of triangular lattice . ]",
    "then the four generators are given by the following formulae    @xmath56    for symmetric spin liquid states there must be four gauge group transformations @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , such that the mean field ansatz is invariant under @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we can represent the four gauge operations by their phase , : b_e^()b _ where the @xmath65 are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the psg is generated by combining the generators of the igg : @xmath66 , and the above four compound operators @xmath67 .",
    "the structure of the space group imposes algebraic constraints on the @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , the combination of translations shown in fig .  [ fig : algebraicrelation ] should be equivalent to the identity , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "therefore we require that the implementation of these symmetries in the psg : @xmath70 must be the equivalent of an identity operation , which means it is an element of the igg , either @xmath45 or @xmath66 .",
    "this string can be rewritten as @xmath71 . using the fact that for a space group operation @xmath72 , the gauge transformation @xmath73 acting on site @xmath54 will just give a phase @xmath74 $ ] ( where @xmath75 is the image of @xmath76 under the space group operation @xmath72 ) , we end up with the equation    & -[()]+[()]+[^-1()]-()[equ : psgt1t2equation ] + = & p_1    where @xmath77 is independent of the site index @xmath54 , and arises from the fact that the identity operation can be any one of the two elements of the igg .",
    "an example of a relation between space group elements @xmath69 , that leads to an algebraic constraint on the psg . ]",
    "this kind of algebraic constraints strictly restrict the possible structures of psg .",
    "it turns out ( proof is in appendix  [ asec : algpsg ] ) that there is only a finite set of such constraints , which if satisfied guarantees that all relations between space group elements are satisfied .",
    "these relations , beginning with the one described above , are :    @xmath78 ^ 5 \\\\ \\mirror^{-1 } & = & \\mirror\\\\   \\rotsix\\mirror & = & \\mirror [ \\rotsix ] ^{5 } \\label{eqn : mirrorrotsix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these relations place severe constraints on the allowed psgs .",
    "the most general solution that satisfies them is :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 are either 0 or 1 .",
    "thus there are at most _ eight _ distinct schwinger boson symmetric spin liquid states on isotropic triangular lattice .",
    "if we put more conditions on the mean field ansatz ( _ e.g. _ that the nearest - neighbor @xmath42 are nonzero ) , then the number of possible symmetric spin liquid states is reduced from eight .    a detailed derivation of the above formulae is given in appendix  [ asec : algpsg ] .",
    "also we include the solution of algebraic psgs on the anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "if we assume that nearest - neighbor amplitudes @xmath42 are nonzero , ( which is natural given that nearest neighbor interactions in physical models tend to be dominant and usually antiferromagnetic ) , there are more constraints on the possible psg structures .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "since @xmath52 maps bond @xmath81 to itself , we must have @xmath82 .",
    "this imposes the constraint @xmath83 . also , bonds @xmath84 and @xmath85 are related by a 180 degree rotation , @xmath86 , and by antisymmetry and translation @xmath50 we have @xmath87 .",
    "this leads to another constraint    & ( -1,0)+(0,1)+(1,1)+3(0,0 ) + = & 2    which fixes @xmath88 .",
    "thus we have only _ two _ non - equivalent psgs , corresponding to @xmath89 , which we call the zero - flux state or @xmath90 which we call the @xmath1-flux state .",

    "<S> a symmetry based analysis ( projective symmetry group ) is used to study spin liquid phases on the triangular and kagom lattices in the schwinger boson framework . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum of eight distinct @xmath0 spin liquid states are found for each lattice , which preserve all symmetries . out of these </S>",
    "<S> only a few have nonvanishing nearest neighbor amplitudes which are studied in greater detail . on the triangular lattice , </S>",
    "<S> only two such states are present - the first ( zero - flux state ) is the well known state introduced by sachdev , which on condensation of spinons leads to the 120 degree ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> the other solution which we call the @xmath1-flux state has not previously been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> spinon condensation leads to an ordering wavevector at the brillouin zone edge centers , in contrast to the 120 degree state . </S>",
    "<S> while the zero - flux state is more stable with just nearest - neighbor exchange , we find that the introduction of either next - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange or four spin ring - exchange ( of the sign obtained from a hubbard model ) tends to favor the @xmath1-flux state . on the kagom ' e lattice four solutions are obtained - two have been previously discussed by sachdev , which on spinon condensation give rise to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin ordered states . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we find two states with significantly larger values of the quantum parameter at which magnetic ordering occurs . </S>",
    "<S> for one of them this even exceeds unity , @xmath4 in a nearest neighbor model , indicating that if stabilized , could remain spin disordered for physical values of the spin . </S>",
    "<S> this state is also stabilized by ring exchange interactions with signs as derived from the hubbard model . </S>"
