    "nearly two decades ago , a series of papers  @xcite began to investigate the possibility of creating an inflationary universe  in a laboratory \"  that is , inside a surrounding region of much lower vacuum energy .",
    "the spacetime of such a  bubble universe \" was modeled as a spherically symmetric de sitter region ( the false vacuum ) joined to a surrounding schwarzschild geometry ( the true vacuum ) by an infinitesimally thin domain wall .",
    "these studies found that the inflating ( false vacuum ) region could not avoid collapse unless either the null energy condition or cosmic censorship were violated in the full spacetime  @xcite , but that the creation of an enduring inflating region might be possible via quantum tunneling  @xcite . in this picture , henceforth denoted the farhi - guth - guven ( fgg ) mechanism , a classically constructable expanding bubble , which would classically re - collapse ( both from the inside and outside perspective  @xcite ) , instead tunnels to a new solution in which the inflating interior expands forever , while an outside observer sees a black hole  .",
    "the probability of this occurring can be calculated using the techniques of semi - classical quantum gravity , and is extraordinarily small .",
    "though nearly - miraculous , this process has garnered new interest recently , primarily because of evidence that our universe may have a fundamental positive cosmological constant .",
    "if so , it will asymptotically approach everlasting equilibrium as de sitter spacetime .",
    "given eternity , even the most unlikely process  such as the creation of inflating bubble universes  will eventually occur . taking this one step further",
    ", our observable universe could in fact be such a bubble universe , which arose from equilibrium de sitter space and is currently returning to it .",
    "this would realize the old idea of boltzmann that the universe is fundamentally in equilibrium , but that extremely rare downward fluctuations in entropy periodically occur and allow the transitory existence of non - equilibrium regions that see entropy steadily increasing .",
    "the classic problem with this idea was pointed out in its new context by dyson , susskind , & kleban  @xcite : if our observable universe resulted from a downward entropy fluctuation that evolved with increasing entropy to the present time , then it is vastly more likely for this to have occurred by a fluctuation to our observable universe ten minutes ago ( replete with incoming photons and memories in our brains to convince us that it is older ) than by a fluctuation all the way to the much lower entropy corresponding to inflation  .",
    "albrecht and sorbo  @xcite , however , argue that inflation might avoid this problem by turning a tiny region of low entropy _ density _ into a very large one .",
    "their calculation shows that the fgg mechanism requires a much smaller entropy fluctuation than directly creating the large post - reheating region that will result from it , thus resolving the paradox .",
    "there may , however , be reasons to doubt that the creation of small regions of false vacuum and subsequent tunneling are plausible events .",
    "first , there is no regular instanton describing either the nucleation of small regions of false vacuum or the gravitational tunneling event ; there _ is _ such an instanton describing tunneling to false - vacuum , but over a huge region , larger than the true - vacuum horizon ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "second , banks  @xcite has pointed out that it is hard to understand the tunneling process holographically  it appears that the inflating region inside the bubble has many more states than the black hole it is  contained in \" ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "third , dutta & vachaspati  @xcite have recently ( and previously in  @xcite ) argued that general causality considerations preclude the formation of a small false - vacuum region inside a large true - vacuum one .",
    "both in terms of the initial conditions for inflation , and also the more general issue of what processes can lead to transitions between vacuum states ( as is important in understanding the string theory `` landscape '' ) , it is crucial to understand bubble universes , whether they can form , and with what probabilities . to this question",
    "the present paper makes the following contributions : first , we organize and interpret all of the thin - walled , spherically symmetric one bubble spacetimes .",
    "we then show that expanding false vacuum bubbles are unstable to non - spherical perturbations ; _",
    "if _ these bubbles start at a sufficiently small initial radius , then they inevitably become nonlinearly aspherical before tunneling might occur in the fgg mechanism .",
    "it is unclear in this case whether tunneling to an inflationary universe inside the bubble can occur at all , or with what probability .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the allowed solutions to the junction conditions are enumerated , putting the previous work into context .",
    "we provide a concise reference for all of the possible spacetimes with one false - vacuum bubble and arbitrary positive cosmological constant , then discuss the existing , and some new , interpretations of these solutions . in sec .  [ perts ]",
    "we derive the first order perturbation equations , and demonstrate the existence of an instability in bound solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] we integrate the equations to investigate the parameter space for which non - linear perturbations are unavoidable , and we conclude in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the dynamics of inflating regions has been discussed by a number of authors  @xcite using the junction condition formalism .",
    "these works study a spherically symmetric region of false vacuum ( high energy density ) in a surrounding region of true vacuum ( lower energy density ) .",
    "the wall separating the regions is assumed to be very thin compared to the radius of the region of false vacuum .",
    "one can obtain the dynamics of the wall by requiring metric continuity across the wall and then solving einstein s equations .",
    "under spherical symmetry , the dynamics of the problem then reduce to those of the bubble wall s radius .",
    "this radius is a gauge invariant quantity because it simply quantifies the curvature of the bubble wall worldsheet , and any observer can measure it by comparing the normal to the wall at two nearby points .",
    "let @xmath0 be the cosmological constant in the true vacuum region . then if @xmath1 , the region is schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime with metric @xmath2 @xmath3 in the static foliation .",
    "fixing @xmath0 , there are then three qualitatively different casual structures characterized by the value of @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) , due to the nature of the three roots of @xmath5    for @xmath6 , there are three distinct real roots of form : @xmath7 where @xmath8    and @xmath9 .",

    "[ confdiags2 ] proceeds similarly .",
    "based on the inward pressure gradient , the iv - i - ii / iii solution is what one might expect the junction conditions to yield : a sphere of false vacuum which expands and then contracts .",

    "[ confdiags2 ] .",
    "for instance , the evolution of the iv - iii - ii / iii ( solution 2 ) solution is qualitatively similar to the iv - i - ii / iii solution , but is so massive that its evolution is always hidden behind the black hole event horizon .",
    "the iv - i - ii/iii - ii ( solutions 3 and 4 ) solution is a bubble which has enough kinetic energy to escape collapse by expanding through the cosmological horizon ; observers inside ( or who travel inside from region i ) the false vacuum region will find themselves in an inflationary universe at late times . in the time - reverse of this solution , a bubble implodes from infinity into the black hole horizon , and the interior undergoes collapse .",

    "[ a2_9b3 ] ) .",
    "this causes the bubble wall to accelerate in the direction of the _ false _ vacuum from the interior perspective .",
    "the reason for the disparity is that solution 4 exists only when the interior and exterior cosmological constants are similar in magnitude , and so the wall tension can have greater influence on the dynamics .",
    "the remaining solutions , shown in fig",
    ".  [ confdiags2 ] , have interiors which approach an inflationary universe at late times , but lie on the opposite side of the wormhole in the exterior sds spacetime . to an observer in region iii of the sds diagram , the iv-iii - ii/iv - i - ii ( solutions 5 ) and iv-iii - ii/iv - iii - ii solutions ( solutions 6 and 7 ) would appear as a `` sky '' of false vacuum that encroaches from infinity , reaches a minimum radius and then expands back out .",
    "it has been pointed out by bousso @xcite that at late times ( in an asymptotically flat spacetime ) the wall trajectory according to the observer in region iii of the s(ds ) diagram approaches that of a true vacuum bubble  @xcite .",
    "amusingly , the sds observer will think he is in a true vacuum bubble surrounded by a large region of false vacuum , while the ds observer will think she is in a false vacuum bubble surrounded by a large region of true vacuum .",
    "this symmetry between true and false vacuum bubbles is made manifest in the analysis of the coleman - de luccia  @xcite instanton , which describes the production of both true and false vacuum bubbles @xcite .",
    "these are zero energy solutions , and so we should look for an @xmath124 unbound solution ; this corresponds ( via eq .",
    "[ qtom ] ) to @xmath125 , and we see from fig .",
    "[ apspotential ] , [ gfpotential ] , [ a1b2 ] , and [ a2_9b3 ] that the iv-iii - ii/iv - i - ii solution ( solution 5 ) or the iv-iii - ii/iv - iii - ii solution ( solution 6 ) , depending on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath126 , can be identified as the analytically continued false vacuum instanton . the radius of the bubble wall at the turning point is found by considering the limit as the potential ( eq .

    "these solutions only exist in the case where the interior and exterior cosmological constants are comparable , and so would not correspond to the nucleation of inflation from a universe like ours , but they might be of interest in understanding transitions between nearly degenerate vacua .    examining these classical solutions to first order , we have shown that an instability to aspherical perturbations exists in those solutions which possess a turning point .",
    "this includes the bound ( solutions 1 and 2 ) and unbound solutions ( solutions 5 - 9 ) . in the latter case",

    "the bound solutions are amenable to quantitative investigation , and we have focused on the growth of perturbations in the expanding phase that precedes tunneling in the fgg mechanism . for bound expanding bubbles formed by the fluctuations of a scalar field in de sitter space , there is no instanton to enforce spherical symmetry , so we would expect initial aspherical perturbations to be relatively large . since there is no detailed model for the fluctuating scalar field to see _ how _ large , we have instead calculated an estimate of the minimal deviations from spherical symmetry in light of quantum fluctuations , and present this as an extremely rare , best case scenario for spherical symmetry .",
    "these minimal fluctuations were then evolved to the turning point of the bound solutions , which is the point in the fgg mechanism where there is a chance for tunneling to an inflationary universe to occur .",
    "of the three representative energy scales for inflation ( false vacuum energy densities ) we have studied , the evolved minimal perturbations on a plank scale bubble remain small over most of the allowed parameter space , while the perturbations on gut and weak scale bubbles can grow nonlinear if they start at a sufficiently small ( @xmath277 ) fraction of the turnaround radius .",
    "thus even in the best - case scenario some bubbles become nonlinear , but on the other hand there will always in principle be some that do not .",
    "the instability introduces complications into the use of the fgg mechanism as a means of baby universe production .",
    "the existing calculations of the tunneling rate rely heavily on the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "it is unclear how to perform a similar calculation for a ( possible non - linearly ) perturbed bubble , as the number of degrees of freedom has drastically increased and the assumption of a minisuperspace of spherically symmetric metrics is no longer good .",
    "further , the bubble interior will become filled with scalar gradient and kinetic energy and gravity waves , possibly upsetting the interior sufficiently to prevent inflation .",
    "one might argue that in an eternal universe there is plenty of time to wait around for a fluctuation which is sufficiently spherical .",
    "however , to fully understand the importance of the fgg mechanism , one must both have a model of the scalar field fluctuations , which would predict the distribution of bubble shapes and masses , and also a model for tunneling in the presence of asphericities .",
    "in addition , one must understand the competition among the various processes which result in the formation of inflating false vacuum regions , and thus show that the fgg mechanism is not a relative rarity .",
    "these problems represent significant calculations in a theory of quantum gravity which we do not yet possess , but progress in these areas would undoubtedly improve our understanding of the initial conditions for inflation .",
