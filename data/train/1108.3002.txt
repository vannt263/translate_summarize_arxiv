    "are precision gas sensors  @xcite , transistors with a cutoff frequency of 100ghz  @xcite , flexible touch - screens  @xcite , integrated circuits  @xcite , and many others  @xcite .",
    "one of the promising applications of graphene is its use as an effective spin - filtering material  @xcite . in such graphene - based spin - filter one or",
    "several layers of graphene are sandwiched between two layers of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) material [ current perpendicular to plane ( cpp ) geometry ] . as ferromagnetic electrodes the close packed surfaces ni(111 )  @xcite , co(0001 )  @xcite , or fe(111)/ni(111 )  @xcite interface have to be used .",
    "here , the spin - filtering effect originates from the fact that the projection of the fermi surface of fm on to the close - packed ( 111 ) plane overlaps with the fermi surface of graphene ( single points at the @xmath6 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone of graphene ) only for electrons of one kind of spin , for spin - down electrons  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was predicted for the spin - filtering device where graphene sheet connects two ferromagnetic electrodes made from ni  @xcite .    in the fm / graphene / fm sandwich - like structures",
    "graphene strongly interacts with the ferromagnetic layers  @xcite preventing effective spin - filtering in such a way that two spin - channels start to participate in the transport across the graphene layer .",
    "the effect of strong interaction between graphene and fm was confirmed by means of angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) and near - edge x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( nexafs ) and manifests itself in the strong hybridization of the graphene@xmath7 and ni@xmath8 states in the vicinity of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to overcome this problem : ( i ) use of the several graphene layers , where the upper layers are decoupled from the bottom graphene layer , which is in contact with fm , and the dirac cone is restored allowing effective spin - filtering  @xcite , ( ii ) application as the upper electrode the half - metallic ferromagnetic material ( such material has electrons of only one kind of spin at @xmath1  @xcite ) , which is electronically decoupled from the graphene layer  @xcite , and/or ( iii ) intercalation of noble metals in the space between graphene and a ferromagnetic electrode  @xcite that leads to the weakening of the interaction of the graphene layer and substrate with the corresponding restoring of the dirac cone . whereas the first two cases were not studied in detail or only sporadic studies of the electronic structure of the system can be found in the literature , the effect of intercalation of noble metals on the electronic structure of the graphene layer on metallic substrates was studied in more detail  @xcite .",
    "these studies performed by means of arpes and supported by theoretical calculations  @xcite demonstrate that a clear hybridization between the graphene@xmath7 and @xmath9 states of noble metals exists at the graphene / noble - metal interface  @xcite .",
    "such hybridization interaction can lead ( due to the strong spin - orbit interaction  @xcite ) to an effective spin - scattering at the interface between noble metal and graphene .",
    "one of the possibilities to avoid such undesirable effect is the substitution of the @xmath9-electron noble metals by a simple @xmath0 metal , which can lead to the restoring of the dirac cone in the vicinity of @xmath1 in contrast to the graphene / fm case , where it is destroyed by the strong interaction between graphene and the fm substrate .",
    "the effect of spin - scattering is thus avoided at the interface between graphene and a @xmath0 metal .    here",
    ", we investigate the geometry and electronic properties of the graphene / al/ ni(111 ) intercalation - like system by means of low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and a combination of spectroscopic methods [ nexafs , core - level photoelectron spectroscopy ( cl - pes ) , arpes ] and state - of - the - art band structure calculations .",
    "it was found that aluminum , which has electronic configuration @xmath10 , effectively decouples graphene from the substrate that dirac cone is fully restored in the vicinity of @xmath1 contrary to the graphene / ni(111 ) system .",
    "in contrast to the noble - metal graphene - based intercalation - like systems , in the present case there is no strong hybridization between graphene@xmath7 and @xmath9 states that will lead to decreasing of the effect of spin - dependent scattering at the interface .",
