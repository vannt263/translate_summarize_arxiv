    "a distinctive element of inflation is its proposal that the structures of the universe had their birth through a purely quantum mechanism .",
    "this mechanism relies on two essential components , the natural variations , or fluctuations , which occur for any quantum field and an extremely rapid expansion during an early stage of the universe .",
    "it is this expansion that stretches the tiny quantum fluctuations until they are of a vast size , forming the pattern of primordial perturbations frozen into the otherwise smooth background of space - time .    because inflation relies upon such a simple and elegant set of ingredients , its basic predictions are shared across many of its particular implementations @xcite .",
    "the typical model for inflation uses a quantum scalar field , called the inflaton , both to drive the expansion through its classical potential and to provide a source for the quantum fluctuations when combined with the scalar component of the gravitational fluctuations . for this potential energy to be able to dominate the dynamics",
    ", the kinetic energy of the inflaton should be small , which in turn implies some rather stringent constraints on the shape of the potential .",
    "the potential must be remarkably flat during the period when inflation occurs which requires that the mass and the couplings of the quantum part should be small . as a consequence ,",
    "the primordial set of perturbations produced by inflation describes a nearly featureless pattern of gaussian noise .",
    "even more distinctively , inflation also predicts that this pattern should extend beyond the causal horizon that would have been expected of a universe that had not undergone an inflationary phase .",
    "the radiation and matter environments which come eventually to dominate the evolution of the universe after inflation ends react to these primordial perturbations with a characteristic pattern @xcite .",
    "in fact , exactly this pattern has been observed recently both in the cosmic microwave background @xcite as well as the structure of the universe on scales sufficiently large to be still unaffected by nonlinearities of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "moreover , the anticorrelation of the fluctuations in the polarization and in the temperature of the microwave background radiation at large scales , which  without inflation  would have been out of causal contact until only recently , is also consistent with the expectations of inflation @xcite .    despite this consistency between its predictions and",
    "what is observed , inflation nevertheless contains several unappealing properties @xcite .",
    "the most significant of these follows directly from those two basic elements of inflation : its quantum component and its space - time expansion . consider a fluctuation of a particular size at the end of inflation , which we choose to be one that will later produce some feature in the microwave background . as we follow its evolution backwards in time ,",
    "its size shrinks until it is within the inflationary hubble horizon .",
    "if we continue still further back , provided inflation lasted sufficiently long , this fluctuation would eventually be smaller than the planck length , where we no longer have a perturbative description of the quantum theory .",
    "this observation  that we might have to know all the subtleties at the planck scale if we are to predict the patterns of structure seen in the universe  constitutes the _ trans - planckian problem _ of inflation @xcite .",
    "the trans - planckian problem actually has two sides , one more practical and the other aesthetic . at the practical level ,",
    "all of the features of the observed universe can be explained without extending any of scales of the primordial perturbations so far back that they were smaller than the planck scale .",
    "if we are content to start our theory when these perturbations are larger than the planck scale but still within the hubble horizon , then all of their subsequent evolution can be described perturbatively . in proceeding thus ,",
    "we must make some choice about the inflaton s state when we begin the evolution .",
    "so there is nothing that invalidates our using inflation to generate the primordial perturbations ; it simply becomes must more doubtful to regard it as a `` final '' theory , that is , one which automatically chooses everything  the correct state as well  for us .",
    "this choice corresponds to the second , aesthetic , side of the trans - planckian problem . to explain why a particular state is appropriate requires inevitably looking further back during inflation , or appealing to some additional mechanism , and to do so requires that we make some assumption about either what states are natural , even speaking of their features on arbitrarily small scales , or what is the appropriate description of quantum gravity  assuming that it can provide a perturbative , controlled framework .",
    "there is , however , another approach to this problem which is much more in keeping with the principles of effective field theory @xcite . from its perspective , inflation is no longer seen as a final theory , one that can be extended to arbitrarily early times ; instead , we gain a controlled method for describing the generic imprint of new physics beyond the energy scales of inflation .",
    "an effective field theory divides phenomena according to whether they are of lower or higher energy compared with an energy or mass scale @xmath0 , associated with some physics that does not appear directly at the lower energies . as a field theory ,",
    "the observed degrees of freedom and their symmetries determine the renormalizable operators included , but the nonrenormalizable operators , which are the artifacts of that hidden physics , are left completely general , as long as they do not violate any low energy symmetries .",
    "what makes this approach predictive is that all of these higher order operators are accompanied by inverse powers of the scale @xmath0 so that in a measurement made at an energy @xmath1 , for example , the effect of a particular operator associated with the new physics is suppressed by a power of @xmath2 . for a fixed experimental accuracy",
    ", only a small number of these operators will be measurable .",
    "thus any practical measurement requires only a finite set of unknown parameters , at least until we are able to probe the new physics directly , @xmath3 .",
    "effective field theory strictly applies to the evolution of the state , and by itself does not capture how new physics may be imprinted in a particular initial state .",
    "to do so , we introduce an effective description of the state @xcite .",
    "this effective description applies a similar principle , dividing the structures in a state according to whether they vary significantly or not over a length scale @xmath4 . here",
    ", the mass scale @xmath0 can be any value above the hubble scale during inflation , @xmath5 , which plays the same role as the measurement scale @xmath6 above .",
    "furthermore , while @xmath0 can certainly correspond to the planck mass , @xmath7 , it can also more generally be any scale beyond @xmath5 , such as the binding energy of a composite inflaton or the excitation energy of some hidden field , for example . in an analogy with an effective field theory ,",
    "the behavior of the state at lengths much longer than @xmath4 is chosen phenomenologically , in this case to match the symmetries of the coarse features of the primordial perturbations extracted from the microwave background . at short distances",
    ", the structure of the state is parameterized by a set of moments scaling as increasing powers of @xmath4 .",
    "we shall refer to this last set of structures at the `` trans - planckian '' part of the state , even when @xmath8 .",
    "an effective theory relies on the smallness of the ratio of the dynamically accessible scale  here that provided by inflation @xmath5and the scale of new phenomena , @xmath0 , to provide a perturbative framework . for this perturbation theory to be sensible ,",
    "we need to show how to treat processes which are sensitive to the short - distance structures . for the purely scalar part of the theory",
    ", such processes correspond to loop corrections , which sum over all intermediate momenta and are thus also sum over the arbitrarily short - distance features of the state . in @xcite , we showed that such processes introduce new divergences which are confined to the initial time at which the state is defined ; consequently , they are cancelled by including the appropriate operators localized on this same space - like surface . through this boundary renormalization ,",
    "the loop corrections are rendered completely finite and small .",
    "on the gravitational side , the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for the quantum part of the scalar field similarly sums together the contributions over all distance scales . in this case",
    ", the short - distance structure of the effective state of the scalar field again produces divergences at the initial - time boundary , but these divergences are now wholly proportional to terms that depend on the classical component of gravity .",
    "such divergences therefore require that we also apply our boundary renormalization prescription to gravity .",
    "this program was begun in @xcite where we treated gravity classically .",
    "however , since the boundary divergences arise from quantum effects , it is more appropriate to treat both gravity and the scalar field on an equal footing , which is done here . in this article",
    ", we describe the origin and the renormalization of the new boundary divergences in the energy and momentum associated with the effective initial state when we include a small quantum fluctuation in the space - time metric about a classically expanding background .",
    "the next section reviews the behavior of gravity in the small fluctuation limit and derives the relevant parts of the action that are required for the renormalization of the energy - momentum tensor in this limit .",
    "sections  [ propagate ] and [ evolve ] summarize the effective state idea , describing first how the information in the effective state modifies the propagator and then how the time - evolution of matrix elements is defined .",
    "section  [ graviton ] provides an overview of the general method for renormalizing the boundary divergences in the energy - momentum tensor which is then exemplified in the following section through three simple specific cases .",
    "this article is part of a series @xcite that establishes the renormalizability and consistency of the effective description of an initial state .",
    "several of the applications of this formalism are outlined in the concluding section .",
    "we begin with the action for gravity and the scalar field , @xmath9 here we have explicitly referred to the full space - time manifold , @xmath10 , since later we shall also include a component for the action at the initial boundary .",
    "some of the terms in the boundary action are fixed by the bulk action , but others depend on the state of the system .",

    "we shall study here a conformally flat space - time , so among the three available invariant terms with four derivatives , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we only require a linear combination of these invariants that is orthogonal to both the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath15 which being a total derivative does not affect the dynamics of gravity , and the squared weyl term , @xmath16 which vanishes for conformally flat metrics .",
    "the simplest such orthogonal combination is provided by the @xmath12 term alone .",
    "a completely general set of fluctuations about the conformally flat background will generate the squared weyl term , but since we shall confine the calculation to how the quantum parts of the scalar field affect the classical part of the geometry , the @xmath12 term is by itself sufficient for this purpose .",

    "the advantage of this approach , compared with treating gravity only classically , is that it is more straightforward to understand the renormalization of the gravitational equation , particularly that component of the renormalization that is associated with the boundary divergences produced by the initial state , since these matrix elements contain an additional time integral associated with evolving the state from its initial form defined at @xmath32 to an arbitrary later time @xmath33 . in these tadpole conditions ,",

    "the effective theory of an initial state provides a formalism for describing the signatures of new physics in a state that can not be captured by an ordinary effective field theory .",
    "when we apply this effective theory to inflation , this new physics can potentially refer to the dynamics at the planck scale , where the correct theory of quantum gravity has yet to be established .",
    "we have therefore allowed very general structures in the initial state , including those that do not obey the usual hadamard condition at short distances .",
    "so before we can apply this formalism , we should first show that it is perturbatively stable in both its field theoretical and gravitational components  that is , that the new short distance structures we have allowed in the state do not lead to any divergences that we can not cancel though a suitable renormalization prescription . moreover , even after renormalizing the divergent parts of energy - momentum tensor , it is important to show that the remaining trans - planckian contribution to the gravitational equations of motion , called the back - reaction , should be sufficiently small that it does not overwhelm the original vacuum energy that sustained the inflationary expansion @xcite .    in two earlier articles",
    "@xcite we addressed the field theory side of the boundary renormalization . in an interacting scalar theory , the loop corrections sum over the short - distance structures of the state ;",
    "the new divergences associated with these structures are confined to the initial - time boundary and are removed by adding counterterms at that surface .",
    "similarly , the energy - momentum in a free scalar field is also sensitive to this initial state information and it also produces divergences at the initial - time boundary that are proportional to powers of the scale factor and its derivatives .",
    "here we have shown how these divergences are cancelled by adding gravitational counterterms at the boundary .",
    "an interesting property of these counterterms is that they are relevant or irrelevant according to whether the corresponding moment of the initial state affects the state at long or at short distances .",

    "@xcite , the trans - planckian signature tends to be rather distinctive , with a correlated amplitude and period in the correction to the primordial power spectrum .",
    "this correlation does not naturally result , for example , from features in the inflaton potential , so it should be possible to distinguish the signatures for these two sources for small corrections to the power spectrum  the inflaton potential and the effective state .",
    "the advantage of any effective theory is that it depends only very generally on the assumed symmetries of a system and is rather independent of the details of a particular model .",

    "( [ fkdef ] ) and extracting the coefficient of the leading trans - planckian term .",
