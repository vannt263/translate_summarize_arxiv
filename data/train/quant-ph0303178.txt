    "a relevant question is what happens when different processes act simultaneously on a system .",
    "surprisingly , knowledge of the individual quantum channels alone is insufficient to specify the action of the simultaneous operation of both maps  @xcite .",
    "an experimental determination of the interference of the two maps reveals additional information about the maps which is not taken into account in their individual descriptions and is a measure of their coherent properties . from this",
    ", we may define an operational definition of coherent fidelity between cp maps .",

    "single particle interference ( fig .",
    "[ fig : machzender ] ) displays the key elements of quantum mechanics : the superposition of indistinguishable paths , and the complementarity of certain observables .",
    "interference is a consequence of the possibility of the particle taking both paths , and any process which tends to label the path of the particle will reduce the magnitude of the interference  @xcite .",
    "in general , the perfect interference pattern will be modified by the presence of quantum processes occurring in the upper and lower arms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ] ) . for unitary processes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : machnet ] ) , the evolution of a particle with initial internal state @xmath0 is , @xmath1 .",

    "the higher their fidelity  hence the lower their distinguishability  the greater the interference effect .",
    "conversely , if the states exiting the upper and lower arms were perfectly distinguishable ( orthogonal ) , there would be no interference .",

    "we will assume these are trace preserving and have the same input and output ( finite dimensional ) spaces .",
    "we can model this case by extending the state space of the entire system by appending two ancillas f and e ( assuming that @xmath18 and @xmath15 are independent processes ) , which are coupled to the top and bottom paths by overall unitaries , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which implement the cp maps , @xmath18 and @xmath15 respectively  @xcite ( figs .",

    "we may instead uniquely specify @xmath24 via the jamiokowski isomorphism  @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the maximally entangled state and there exists a one - one correspondence between the set of cp maps and the set of bipartite density operators having one subsystem with maximally mixed reduced density operator .",
    "we can trivially extend both the overall unitaries to act on the whole space of the particle , and ancillas e and f , @xmath27 the action of the interferometer on an initially pure state of the particle is now given by @xmath28        thus the probability of the particle exiting from the horizontal output port is given by @xmath29 in general , if the particle has internal state @xmath30 , the probability is @xmath31\\right\\}\\right).\\ ] ] the relevant quantity in the above can be expressed as @xmath32 = { \\mbox{tr}\\left } [ \\upsilon_0^\\dagger \\nu_0 \\varrho\\right],\\ ] ] where the kraus operators for @xmath18 and @xmath15 are given by @xmath33 again , if the input is the maximally mixed state , the interference pattern depends on @xmath34 $ ] only .",
    "this reduces to the previously considered case if the operations in the upper and lower paths are unitary on the internal state of the particle .",
    "it is interesting to note that the visibility is dependent on a particular decomposition of the two cp maps , in particular the overlap of the first kraus operators of @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "we may interpret this in the framework of quantum jumps  @xcite .",
    "the visibility is a consequence of the indistinguishability of the two possible paths of the particle through the interferometer , anything that serves to tag the passage of the particle serves to reduce the interference pattern .",
    "this may not just be an internal change in the state of the particle ( created by differing unitary operations @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) but also any changes in the environment which may mark the particle s passage .",
    "thus , the first kraus operators of both @xmath18 and @xmath15 denote the action of the operation when there is no quantum jump of the environment `` watching '' the particle .",
    "the residual overlap concerns the `` unitary '' action of the cp map under this condition of no jump .",
    "note that even though a cp map may seem to be unitary when only acting on the internal degrees of freedom , i.e. @xmath37 the first kraus operator may be the zero operator , @xmath38 , and hence give zero visibility  , e.g. @xmath39 in this case , the map serves as an indicator of path , entangling the fact of the passage of the particle with the environment without altering the internal state . in the interferometer ,",
    "this results in the destruction of all interference . in general",
    ", a cp map will necessarily entangle the passage of the particle with environmental degrees of freedom ( a non - product @xmath16 ) , hence reducing the interference beyond the effect of altering the internal state of the particle .",
    "we may thus define a coherent fidelity between two sets of kraus operators implementing different cp maps as , @xmath40\\right|,\\ ] ] and their relative phase , @xmath41\\right ) .\\ ] ] we may note that another fidelity measure on the set of cp maps has been defined via the uhlmann fidelity  @xcite between the density operators defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jamiolkowski ] )  @xcite , @xmath42.\\ ] ]",
    "for a set of kraus operators @xmath43 defining a cp map @xmath24 , we may define a measure of its self - coherence by inserting two independent instances of @xmath24 into both arms of an interferometer .",
    "if the cp map is unitary , then the interference pattern will have unit visibility .",
    "however , if there are more than one kraus operator , @xmath44<1,\\ ] ] we can take this to measure the distance of @xmath24 to the set of unitaries .",
    "it is interesting to ask , for a given @xmath24 , and for all possible compatible sets of kraus operators , what is the maximum visibility or self - coherence ?",
    "in other words , for all sets of kraus operators @xmath43 implementing @xmath24 , what is the largest value of @xmath45 $ ] ?",
    "the canonical method of constructing a set of kraus operators of a cp map is given by choi  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath43 created are linearly independent and thus represent the minimum number of operators required to represent @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath46 also implement @xmath24 , they are related by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an isometry in general , or unitary when the number of elements in each set are equal .",
    "it can easily be shown that the largest possible visibility is obtained when @xmath43 are orthogonal , @xmath49 = \\delta_{ij}{\\mbox{tr}\\left } [ \\lambda_j^\\dagger\\lambda_j\\right ] , \\label{eq : orthog}\\ ] ] and the largest element is @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath24 is placed in both arms , this upper limit is a measure of the intrinsic ( de)coherence of the process",
    ". the visibility of an actual realisation of @xmath24 may be smaller than this maximum due to processes as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : notunitary ] ) but this does not represent intrinsic decoherence of the map itself .",
    "we can also find the closest unitary operator to a given set of kraus operators @xmath43 which induce the cp map @xmath24 by considering an interferometer with @xmath24 occurring one arm , and a unitary @xmath35 operation in the other arm which we may alter as we like .",
    "we can maximise the interference pattern by changing @xmath35 , and hence obtain the closest unitary to @xmath43 .",
    "the visibility is given by @xmath51\\right| = \\frac{1}{d}\\left|{\\mbox{tr}\\left } [ \\sqrt{\\lambda_0 \\lambda_0^\\dagger}u_{\\lambda_0 } u\\right]\\right|,\\ ] ] where we have used the polar decomposition of @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the visibility is thus maximised when @xmath53 . if the eigenvalues of @xmath54 are @xmath55 , then the visibility when @xmath24 is in both arms is simply @xmath56 , whereas if we compare @xmath24 with its closest unitary , it is @xmath57 , and it is easy to see that @xmath58 .",
    "we can also consider what is the maximum coherent fidelity between two cp maps @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be orthogonal kraus sets for @xmath18 and @xmath15 respectively ( eq .  ( [ eq : orthog ] ) ) , and @xmath61)$ ]",
    "be the matrix of their inner products .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are also compatible kraus operators for @xmath18 and @xmath15 ( eq .  ( [ eq : isom ] ) ) , then @xmath64\\right| = \\left| \\sum_{ij } { \\mbox{tr}\\left } [ g_{0i}^{*}\\upsilon_i^\\dagger h_{0j}\\nu_j\\right ] \\right| = \\left| \\sum_{i } g_{0i}^ { * } \\sum_{j } a_{ij } h_{0j } \\right|\\ ] ] is maximised when @xmath65 where we have used the operator norm of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the first column vectors of the isometries @xmath69 and @xmath70 relating @xmath59 and @xmath60 to @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "this reduces to the previous case where both cp maps are the same and thus @xmath73 is real diagonal .",
    "interferometry can be applied to the case of non - unitary processes to extract information about the underlying physical processes which implement them . in particular",
    ", we can derive a measure of the coherence of a quantum operation , its maximum for any cp map , and the closest unitary under this measure .",
    "it is to seen whether consideration of dynamical cp maps can impose further internal structure on quantum operations .",
