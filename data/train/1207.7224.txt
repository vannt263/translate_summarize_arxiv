    "quantumness  is very fragile and its surviving over long distances and times is subtly interconnected to the amount of noise coupling into the quantum system through its unavoidable interaction with the classical environment . among the different quantum signatures , entanglement",
    ", a concept firstly introduced by schrdinger @xcite in response to the famous einstein , podolsky and rosen paper in 1935 @xcite , probably represents the most fascinating one .",
    "the conceptual consequences of entanglement are somehow subtle and deeply affect many aspects of modern physics as the interaction between reality and observer @xcite , the actual limit for defining metrology standards @xcite , the limit to communication security @xcite .",
    "the optical realization of such an intriguing quantum feature has gained , in the last decades , a central role for realising complex quantum communication protocols @xcite . among the different approaches the use of bright beams , _",
    "i.e. _ optical modes carrying many photons , appears as the most robust carrier of entangled information @xcite no matter if the latter will be coded into single  photon  like states ( discrete quantum coding ) or over the quadratures of the carrier beams ( continuous valued quantum coding ) @xcite .    by interacting with the external world , a pure quantum state decoheres into a mixture @xcite and its quantumness , if not completely death @xcite , need to be restored or re  enhanced by suitable protocols shor95 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "decoherence limits both the attainable protocol fidelity and the type of accessible protocols .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss and experimentally analyse the effects of the transmission over a lossy channel on the quantumness of bi  partite gaussian continuous variable ( cv ) optical entangled states . while these effects on cv entangled states obtained by above threshold opos have been already investigated @xcite , we focus our analysis on the states generated by a type - ii sub  threshold opo @xcite .",
    "the birth of an entangled state happens whenever a genuine quantum correlation , _",
    "i.e. _ without classical analogue , is set between two distinguishable quantum systems .",
    "this implies that the system wavefunction can not factorize into the product of wavefunctions of the single sub ",
    "systems . while this definition is almost unique entanglement marks itself into different properties of the quantum state of the whole system and can be seen under different perspectives @xcite .",
    "for this reason , since the first experimental demonstration of entanglement aspect81 several criteria and quantities have been introduced for analyzing _ entanglementness _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the definition of an entangled state is conceptually connected to pure states @xcite .",
    "the properties of these states are described by wave functions and _ gedanken _ experiments can be though for testing different theoretical aspects but we all know that the states we can prepare and manipulate in the laboratory are not pure but mixed . so that , experimental entanglement tests , especially in cv regime , are described in terms of density matrices rather than wavefunctions .",
    "far from the ideal concept of pure states and systems that do not interact with the environment and/or observers , any quantum state undergoes to decoherence phenomena . in optics",
    "the most common process leading to decoherence is the phase insensitive loss of photons through diffusion and absorption mechanisms .",
    "this process is described by a lindblad equation @xcite for the evolution of the field operators that translates into a master equation for the state density matrix .",
    "eventually , if the state is gaussian , _ i.e. _ its wigner function is gaussian , it admits a full description in term of its covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "the investigated cv entangled state represents one of the possible quantum resources in cv teleportation protocols @xcite .",
    "the experimental data we present extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite discussing the behaviour of the cv  entangled system to the strong decoherence regime ( up 99% of loss ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss in details the relationship between the three different entanglement criteria used in the cv  field linking them to the teleportation fidelity and quantum discord , two possible quantum signatures for evaluating the possibility of using this class of states in quantum communication protocols @xcite .",
    "the discussion on the experimental results is preceded by a detailed theoretical foreword aimed at giving a physical insight the different criteria and quantities actually used for classifying cv  entanglement . with this paper",
    "we prove that the state we are able to generate never disentangles .",
    "this rather counter  intuitive result has also been shown theoretically for the case of qubits states , showing a purity at the generation stage above a threshold value @xcite .",
    "moreover , the state we analyse can be used as the quantum resource for an effective quantum teleportation , of a coherent state , for any value of the transmission loss although the teleportation fidelity slowly reduce to its quantum limit .",
    "optical entangled states can be obtained in non ",
    "linear processes such as parametric amplifiers that , depending on their operating regime , can prepare either single photon @xcite or continuous variable gaussian entangled states @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the non  linear medium is allocated in a optical cavity and the opos , below the oscillation threshold and in a semiclassical approach , are described by bilinear hamiltonians so realising the paradigm for gaussian state generation @xcite .",
    "in particular below threshold a single continuous wave opo , generating squeezing in a fully degenerate operation @xcite , can give raise to a pair of bright cv entangled beams in the non  degenerate case @xcite .",
    "both the cases lead to states that represent robust resources for implementing different quantum communication tasks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we experimental discuss the behaviour , under strong loss , of a bright bi ",
    "partite cv gaussian entangled state outing a sub  threshold type ",
    "in particular , we analyse , for this state , the behaviour of different quantumness and entanglement markers in order to discuss the limit at which this state can be transmitted before loosing its quantum ability of being employed in quantum communication protocols .",
