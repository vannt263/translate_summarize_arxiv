    "quantum computation  @xcite is usually described by unitary operations because the time evolution of a closed system is described by unitary transformations .",
    "however , real systems interact with the environment , which entails decoherence and errors in quantum computation . to cope with the problem of decoherence , quantum error - correcting schemes",
    "@xcite have been proposed in which redundant qubits are introduced to ensure fault tolerance .",
    "unfortunately , this qubit overhead is too demanding , since the number of available qubits will be severely restricted in the foreseeable future . to circumvent this problem , a probabilistic quantum error - correcting scheme without redundancy",
    "has recently been proposed  @xcite using a reversing measurement scheme  @xcite .",
    "this scheme involves quantum measurement and is therefore described by nonunitary operations .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of a general quantum information processing based on nonunitary operations , i.e. , quantum circuits that involve not only unitary but also nonunitary gates , the latter of which are implemented by quantum measurements . in a sense , our nonunitary quantum circuit is a generalization of the conventional unitary quantum circuit , because the latter also invokes quantum measurement at the end of computation .",
    "however , in our scheme measurements are exploited not only at the end but in the course of computation .",
    "of course , even in the usual quantum computer , projective measurements are routinely used during computation .",
    "for example , knill , laflamme , and milburn  @xcite have shown that projective measurements can eliminate the need for nonlinear couplings in an optical quantum computer .",
    "gilchrist et al .",
    "@xcite have also shown that an atomic measurement in an optical quantum computer corresponds to a nonunitary operator that is optically nonlinear and is approximately unitary in a hilbert subspace for a single mode .",
    "moreover , raussendorf and briegel  @xcite , and nielsen  @xcite have recently proposed two different schemes of quantum computation that consist entirely of projective measurements .",
    "such measurements are intended to simulate unitary gates , and thus unitary operators connect the output states with the input states .",
    "in contrast , nonunitary operators are the connectors in our nonunitary quantum circuit , based on a general framework of quantum measurement . in other words ,",
    "_ our gates are nonunitary at the logical level as well as at a physical level .",
    "_ this point emerges more clearly by comparing our circuit with an optical quantum computer  @xcite that utilizes coherent states @xmath3 as the qubit states @xmath4 .",
    "these qubit states are only approximately orthogonal for large @xmath5 , since @xmath6 . due to this non - orthogonality",
    ", a unitary logical gate is physically implemented by a nonunitary gate in a wider hilbert space using projective measurements . for example , the hadamard gate @xmath7 , which acts as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , should be nonunitary at the physical level if the coherent - state qubit is used because @xmath10 , while the hadamard gate itself is unitary at the logical level .",
    "a natural question then arises as to whether or not a universal set of nonunitary gates exists for the nonunitary quantum circuit , since it is well known that a set of unitary gates is universal for the unitary quantum circuit  @xcite .",
    "we will show that a set of nonunitary gates is universal for the nonunitary quantum circuit , without the necessity of introducing ancilla qubits . as a consequence of invoking quantum measurement ,",
    "the nonunitary gate operation is necessarily probabilistic ; however , _ we can be sure whether or not the gate operation is successful . _ we will discuss a reversing measurement scheme to increase the probability of successful nonunitary gate operation to the maximum allowable value .",
    "however , the total probability of successful operation of a nonunitary quantum circuit decreases exponentially with the number of nonunitary gates .",
    "this is a tradeoff for the reduction of qubit overhead , because unsuccessful measurements destroy the quantum state and halt the computation .",
    "we will show that if we could apply nonunitary gates with unit probability by some quantum dynamics , we could solve * np*-complete problems in polynomial time .",
    "this parallels the result shown by abrams and lloyd  @xcite , in which a hypothetical nonlinear quantum theory implies a polynomial - time solution for * np*-complete problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : nonuni ] formulates nonunitary gates and sec .",
    "[ sec : univ ] discusses a universal set of nonunitary gates for the nonunitary quantum circuit .",

    "section  [ sec : example ] considers two examples of nonunitary gates : a quantum nand gate and abrams - lloyd s nonlinear gate .",
    "section  [ sec : conclude ] summarizes our results .",
    "we first define the nonunitary gate as a generalization of the unitary gate .",
    "a unitary gate is described as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a unitary operator satisfying @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the identity operator . in the computational basis for @xmath15 qubits , the unitary operator @xmath12 is represented by a complex - valued @xmath16 matrix that satisfies the unitary condition  @xcite .",
    "we define a nonunitary gate operation as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a nonunitary operator to be specified later . in the computational basis for @xmath15 qubits ,",
    "@xmath18 is represented by a complex - valued @xmath16 matrix , without being subject to the unitary condition . since a linear operation in a finite hilbert space",
    "is always bounded and the normalization of @xmath18 does not affect the state after the gate operation , we normalize @xmath18 so that the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath19 is unity : @xmath20    to implement this nonunitary gate , we utilize a general framework of quantum measurement , in which a general measurement is described by a set of measurement operators @xmath21  @xcite . if the system is initially in a state @xmath22 , the probability for outcome @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , and the corresponding postmeasurement state is given by @xmath25 since the total probability @xmath26 is @xmath27 , the measurement operators must satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "this means that all the eigenvalues of @xmath29 must be less than or equal to @xmath27 .",
    "that is , for any @xmath22 , @xmath30    using this general measurement , we implement the nonunitary gate @xmath18 as follows : we perform a measurement @xmath31 with two outcomes , @xmath32 and @xmath27 , such that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a normalization constant .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ normal ] ) and ( [ measure ] ) that @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the successful measurement corresponds to outcome @xmath32 and the unsuccessful measurement corresponds to outcome @xmath27 . with the probability given by @xmath36",
    "the measurement is successful and then the state of the system becomes @xmath37 comparing this equation with definition ( [ nonunit ] ) , we find that this measurement implements a nonunitary gate @xmath18 with the probability of success @xmath38 given in eq .",
    "( [ succprob ] ) . this probability is less than or equal to @xmath39 from eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) .",
    "_ while the measurement may be unsuccessful , we can be sure whether or not the gate operation is successful by checking the measurement outcome . _ in terms of the quantum operations formalism  @xcite , the nonunitary gate @xmath18 is described by a quantum operation : @xmath40 since this quantum operation does not include a summation over the measurement outcomes , a pure state remains pure during the gate operation  @xcite .    while the constant @xmath34 does not affect the postmeasurement state , it does affect the probability of success .",
    "the maximal probability of success is attained by the measurement with @xmath41 . when this optimal measurement is not available",
    ", we can still improve the probability of success so that it is arbitrarily close to the maximum allowable value by applying a reversing measurement scheme to a non - optimal measurement @xmath42 , as will be shown later .",
    "there are , however , two problems with the nonunitary gate .",
    "first , if @xmath43 is zero , then there exists a state @xmath44 such that @xmath45 . for this state",
    ", the measurement never succeeds because @xmath46 .",
    "we can circumvent this problem by excluding the wrong states from the input state , or by choosing @xmath18 such that @xmath43 is nonzero . if @xmath47 , the gate @xmath18 is said to be logically reversible  @xcite in the sense that the input state can be calculated from the output state .",
    "in other words , a logically reversible gate preserves all pieces of information about the input state during the gate operation .",
    "an example of the logically _ irreversible _ gate is the projective measurement , by the action of which the information about the states orthogonal to the projector is completely lost .",
    "the second problem is that the total probability of success of a quantum circuit involving nonunitary gates decays exponentially with the number of nonunitary gates , since an unsuccessful measurement in an intermediate gate forces us to restart from the first gate .",
    "nevertheless , a nonunitary quantum circuit has the advantage of reducing the number of qubits in some situations .",
    "we shall discuss these two issues below , using a quantum nand gate .",
    "we consider a universal set of gates for the nonunitary quantum circuit both with and without ancilla qubits .",
    "an arbitrary quantum measurement can be simulated by the projective measurement and unitary operation with the use of ancilla qubits .",
    "therefore , if ancilla qubits are available , the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate , all one - qubit unitary gates , and the one - qubit projective measurement constitute a universal set for the nonunitary quantum circuit .",
    "we begin by proving this theorem .",
    "consider a @xmath16 nonunitary matrix @xmath18 representing a nonunitary quantum circuit for @xmath15 qubits .",
    "we then make the singular value decomposition of @xmath18 , @xmath48 where @xmath12 and @xmath49 are unitary matrices and @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal components @xmath51 satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath12 and @xmath49 can be further decomposed into cnot gates and one - qubit unitary gates , since this set of gates is universal for the unitary quantum circuit  @xcite .",
    "we thus concentrate on the diagonal matrix @xmath50 . using the not gate",
    "@xmath53 , this matrix can be factorized into @xmath54 matrices that have the form of @xmath55 .",
    "each of these matrices corresponds to a controlled-@xmath56 gate with @xmath57 control qubits ( denoted by @xmath58 $ ] ) , where @xmath56 is a one - qubit nonunitary gate given by @xmath59 the case of @xmath60 is illustrated in fig .",

    "this @xmath58 $ ] gate can be implemented by one @xmath56 gate and two @xmath62 $ ] gates ( i.e. , two cnot gates with @xmath15 control qubits ) with the help of an ancilla qubit prepared in state @xmath63 .",

    "we next consider the case where no ancilla qubits are available . in this case , we can not find a set of gates with which to exactly construct an arbitrary nonunitary circuit .",
    "we therefore apply a definition of universality in a broad sense in which two gates are regarded as identical if they differ only by a normalization factor .",
    "note that the normalization of a nonunitary gate does not affect the state after the gate operation , though it affects the probability of success . with this proviso",
    ", we here prove that if ancilla qubits are not available , the cnot gate , all one - qubit unitary gates , and the @xmath56 gates ( @xmath70 ) constitute a universal set for the nonunitary circuit .",
    "the proof goes as follows .",
    "as shown in the preceding section , an arbitrary nonunitary matrix can be decomposed into the @xmath58 $ ] gates and unitary matrices .",
    "when @xmath71 , each @xmath58 $ ] gate can be further decomposed into controlled-@xmath72 gates , controlled-@xmath73 gates , and cnot gates without ancilla qubits as in the unitary case  @xcite , where @xmath74 .",

    "similarly , the controlled-@xmath73 gate can be implemented by two @xmath77 gates , one @xmath76 gate , and two cnot gates .",
    "therefore , we are left with the @xmath76 and @xmath77 gates ( @xmath79 ) , apart from the cnot gate and the wire @xmath80 . however , the @xmath77 gate is not a gate in the strict sense , because it does not satisfy the normalization condition ( [ normal ] ) due to @xmath81 .",
    "we must renormalize it using the identification up to a normalization factor .",
    "namely , via the equation @xmath82 we express the @xmath77 gate by one @xmath76 gate and two not gates .    on the other hand , when @xmath83 , the @xmath58 $ ] gate becomes the @xmath84 gate , which is paired with the @xmath85 gate through the relation @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the unsuccessful operation of the @xmath85 gate is identical to the successful operation of the @xmath87 $ ] gate , and vice versa .",
    "we thus construct the @xmath85 gate instead of the @xmath87 $ ] gate .",
    "note that the @xmath85 gate corresponds to the @xmath15-qubit projective measurement @xmath88 .",
    "since the one - qubit projective measurement @xmath89 corresponds to the @xmath90 gate , the operation of the @xmath85 gate can be implemented by the action of the @xmath90 gate on each qubit .",
    "consequently , we can construct any nonunitary quantum circuit from the cnot gate , all one - qubit unitary gates , and the @xmath56 gates with @xmath70 .",
    "we finally show that any @xmath56 gate can be _ approximated _ to arbitrary accuracy by only two fixed nonunitary gates together with the not gate . for a real number @xmath91 and an irrational number @xmath92",
