    "in the pursuit of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) it is very common to encounter one or more abelian gauge symmetry than the sm @xmath0 hypercharge .",
    "two familiar examples are the grand unified theories ( guts ) based on @xmath3 that breaks to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the sm gauge group and @xmath6 which ultimately breaks to @xmath7 . because of their guts parentage the extra @xmath1 bosons from the breaking of the @xmath0 symmetries have tree level couplings to the sm particles ; in particular the fermions .",
    "this makes them highly visible and their phenomenology has been well studied  @xcite .",
    "more recently extra dimensional models with extra @xmath0 gauge symmetries in the brane world scenario are increasingly popular .",
    "a feature of this newer construction is that the extra @xmath0 factors can be hidden from the visible sector .",
    "hidden sectors are motivated also by studies in supersymmetry breaking mechanisms .",
    "independent of the theoretical motivation , extra @xmath1 bosons from hidden sector typically do not have direct couplings to the sm particles .",
    "their phenomenology can be very different from visible extra @xmath1 s .",
    "they are also harder to produce . as the start up of the lhc draws near ,",
    "the search for extra @xmath1 bosons is a high priority item due to their relatively clean signatures from drell - yan processes .",
    "clearly it is important to include hard to find extra @xmath1 bosons in this search .",
    "although these bosons have no direct couplings to sm particles , they can manifest themselves through mixings with the sm @xmath1 boson , and so are not completely invisible . since the mixing is crucial for phenomenology we construct the simplest model of this kind to capture the physics of such an extra @xmath1 boson .",
    "it has the gauge symmetry @xmath8 where the subscript denotes `` shadow '' ; the name will become clear later .",
    "the sm fermions are singlet under @xmath9 .",
    "this @xmath9 is broken by a shadow higgs sector which is just the abelian higgs model with a complex scalar @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 field is a sinlget under @xmath5 but interacts with the sm higgs bosons via renormalizable interactions .",
    "the complete lagrangian is given by & = & _ sm - x^x _ - b^x _ + & + & | ( _ -g_s x _ ) _ s|^2 - v(_s , ) , where @xmath11 is the field strength tensor of the sm hypercharge @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the sm higgs field , and @xmath14 is the gauge coupling of the shadow @xmath9 .",
    "for simplicity we have normalized the shadow charge of @xmath10 to unity .",
    "the kinematic mixing of the two @xmath0 s is parameterized by @xmath15 , which a priori need not be a small number . for a visible extra @xmath1 this mixing term is expected to be only induced at the loop level  @xcite , and thus @xmath16 is generally assumed in its phenomenological studies  @xcite .",
    "however , this need not be the case here .",
    "indeed , a calculation in string theory of the mixing - generating vacuum polarization diagram shows that in general , one can expect kinetic mixing effects on the order of @xmath17 at the weak scale ( barring accidental cancellations in the tree level spectrum )  @xcite .",
    "given the theoretical significance outlined above , we shall leave @xmath15 as a free parameter to be constrained by experiments in particular the electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) .",
    "now it is well known that the kinetic terms including the mixing can be recast into canonical form through a @xmath18 transformation .",
    "explicitly , this is given by (    c x + b    ) = (    cc c _ & 0 + - s _ & 1    ) (    c x + b    ) , where [ eq : kinmix ] s_= , c_= .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 will mix resulting in a shift in the sm @xmath1 mass .",
    "the physical bosons are now linear combinations of the two .",
    "the photon will remain massless , and the @xmath21 bosons will be unchanged from the sm .",
    "this is expected since the shadow sector only interacts with @xmath12 through the shadow higgs interactions .",

    "[ sec : phem ] we study the impact @xmath22 has on electroweak precision measurements . from these , as well as anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and recent results from mller scattering , we derive constraints on the parameters of our model , in particular on @xmath2 .",

    "this higgs potential is also used in phantom higgs models  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath25 symmetry is broken down to @xmath26 .",
    "this pattern of breaking is peculiar in that the mass of the @xmath21 boson remains as in the sm , i.e. @xmath27 . in the neutral sector",
    "we have a massless photon and two massive neutral bosons which are not yet in the mass eigenbasis . the usual sm definition : @xmath28 , electric charge @xmath29 , and @xmath30 remain intact .    for the neutral gauge bosons the transformation between the weak and mass basis",
    "is given by the following rotation : (    c b + a_3 + x    ) =(    ccc c_w & -s_w & 0 + s_w & c_w & 0 + 0&0&1    ) (    ccc 1&0&0 + 0 & c _ & -s _ + 0 & s _ & c _    ) (    c + z + z_s    ) , where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) denotes @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and similarly for the rotation angle @xmath35 .",

    "+ . } , for the case where @xmath39 the @xmath1-@xmath22 mixing is proportional to @xmath2 , which is related to the amplitude of the kinetic mixing term @xmath40 .",
    "the most stringent constraints on any extra @xmath1 model come from ewpts , and so we consider next the gauge fermion couplings .",
    "these can be readily read off from the lagrangian . for the photon ( @xmath41 )",
    ", the sm result is retained as it should : a^|ff : i ^e q_f . for @xmath1 , @xmath22 , the coupling are slightly different from the sm , but still flavor universal : [ eq : zff ] z^|ff : i ^ , + [ eq : zprimeff ] z_s^|ff : i ^ , where @xmath42 is the coupling of the sm @xmath1 to fermions .",
    "we see that the neutral current couplings are not only rotated as indicated by the @xmath43 factor , but also contain an extra piece proportional to the fermion hypercharge due to @xmath0-@xmath9 mixing .",
    "hence we need to reexamine the electroweak precision data using the full couplings as well as taking into account the effects due to virtual @xmath22 exchanges .        for the pure gauge sector , it s straightforward to work out the feynman rules .",

    "is not important .",
    "one sees that about half of the ew observables get the wrong sign corrections .",
    "therefore at most we can only make gain and loss balanced .",
    "therefore , we demand that the allowed parameter space does not make the fitting worse and this is shown as the lower band in fig .  [",
