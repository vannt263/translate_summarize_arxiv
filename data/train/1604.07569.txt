    "spin caloritronics is a rising field of research seeking to combine spin , charge , and temperature driven currents to develop new and improved ways of data processing and storage . especially , the usage of temperature driven spin - polarized currents has attracted a lot of attention in the past years , since it may offer a way to deal with rising heat dissipation in nano devices @xcite .    lately , significant progress has been made in controlling temperature differences in magnetic nanostructures over a small distance @xcite , enabling the discovery of , for example , the _ tunnel magneto - seebeck _",
    "( tms ) effect @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs in _ magnetic tunnel junctions _ ( mtjs ) when a temperature difference is generated across the barrier .",
    "the tms effect describes the change of the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) of the mtj between the state of parallel ( @xmath8 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath9 ) relative magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "the effect ratio @xcite can be expressed by @xmath10    recently , the reciprocal effect , the magneto - peltier effect , has also been reported for mtjs @xcite . today , different heating methods are established to generate a temperature difference inside the mtj : indirect joule @xcite , indirect peltier @xcite , and laser induced heating @xcite .",
    "an additional method proposes to use the direct intrinsic joule heating by the tunneling current . with this method ,",
    "the temperature difference is created without additional external heating and , thus , the effect is called the _ intrinsic _ tms effect @xcite .    in most cases",
    "cofeb / mgo / cofeb mtjs are used to study the tms effect , because they are well known , easily prepared and show large _ tunnel magnetoresistance _ ( tmr )",

    "a barrier material theoretically retains the aforementioned properties of mgo ( for example the @xmath11 symmetry filter effect @xcite ) whereas the lattice mismatch with typical electrode materials decreases from about ( 3 - 5)% for mgo to about 1% for mao @xcite .",
    "in addition , mgal@xmath2o@xmath12 double - barrier mtjs show a long - range phase coherence using the resonant states of fe quantum wells with up to 12 nm thickness @xcite . here",
    ", the structural flexibility of mgal@xmath2o@xmath12 ensures a vanishing mismatch between barrier and electrode , effectively enhancing quantum phenomena .",
    "additionally , an improved bias voltage dependence was found with a barrier consisting of mao @xcite",
    ". a maximum tmr ratio of over 160% , a very low _ resistance area product _ ( @xmath13 ) of less than 5@xmath14m@xmath15 , as well as magnetization switching by spin - transfer torque was achieved by depositing and oxidizing mg / mg - al layers @xcite .    in this work",

    "after deposition , ex - situ post annealing in a vacuum furnace is carried out at 350@xmath17c for one hour with a subsequent cooling process in a magnetic field of 0.7 t .",
    "elliptical junctions of 24@xmath18m@xmath15 are prepared by electron beam lithography and subsequent ion beam etching .",
    "ta@xmath2o@xmath19 ( 120 nm ) is sputtered next to the mtjs to serve as insulator . in addition",
    ", au bond pads are placed on top and next to the mtjs to allow electrical contacting via au bonds and optical access .",

    "altogether , the tms ( tmr ) ratios are relatively constant with a variation of @xmath240.25% ( @xmath241% ) between different junctions . for this , we measured the tms ( tmr ) effect at more than five ( ten ) junctions .",

    "a barrier of 1.8 nm mao results in an averaged ( over all laser powers ) tms ratio of @xmath27 . in accordance with previous experiments @xcite , a linear increase of the seebeck voltages with increasing laser power is observed .",
    "simulations are performed with comsol multiphysics to estimate the temperature differences across the barriers and to calculate the seebeck coefficients .",
    "a crucial point within these simulations is the thermal conductivity of thin films as reported in refs . and .",
    "for the mtj with mgo barrier , a value of @xmath2811mk was found for a laser power of 150mw@xcite resulting in seebeck coefficients of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the values used for the simulation of mtj with mao barrier are given in tab .",
    "[ comsol ] and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] . since the thermal conductivity decreases for thin films in comparison to its bulk value and a similar behavior for thin mgo films is observed in ref . , we assume a thermal conductivity of @xmath31 for mao , which is one tenth of the bulk value",
    ". please note that according to ref .",
    "the thermal conductivity is very sensitive to the imbalance of phonon and electron temperature at nano - magnetic interfaces , which is why we use a large error range for the thermal conductivity of mao . with the aforementioned assumption and an applied laser power of 150mw ,",
    "the temperature difference across the tunneling barrier varies between 100mk and 1400mk .",
    "the seebeck coefficients of the mtj are given by @xmath32 .",

    "furthermore , the intrinsic tms ratios do not coincide with the results of the laser induced tms ratios .",
    "please note , that changing the aforementioned assumptions only results in different values for the intrinsic seebeck coefficients .",
    "however , the sign of the intrinsic tms ratio is dominated by the slope of the symmetric contribution . accordingly , in our case , s@xmath54 will always be larger than s@xmath55 for the mtj with mao barrier , thus , resulting in a negative tms ratio .",
    "in addition , the seebeck coefficients obtained from the intrinsic method of the mtj with mgo barrier show a different sign that is not observed with the laser induced tms .",

    "however , the brinkman model offers an alternative way to explain the occurring antisymmetric and symmetric contributions in case of the mao mtj .",
    "we focus on the parallel case where a good agreement between data and model is obtained [ cf .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ] .",
    "now , the symmetry evaluation is performed with simulated i / v curves based on the brinkman model with different values for the barrier asymmetry @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation ] shows the results of the symmetry evaluation of the original data , its corresponding brinkman fit , a reversed barrier asymmetry and a vanishing barrier asymmetry .",
    "obviously , the barrier asymmetry plays a vital role for the symmetric contribution of the v / i curve .",
    "please note that a symmetric barrier shows no symmetric contribution , making the identification of an intrinsic tms impossible .",
    "in contrast , the asymmetric contributions are the same for different values of the barrier asymmetry .",
    "thus , the symmetric contribution of the v / i curve in the parallel case is very well described by the brinkman model even without any assumptions of temperature differences .",
    "we have investigated the tms effect of co@xmath0fe@xmath0b@xmath1/mao and co@xmath4fe@xmath5b@xmath1/mgo mtjs with laser induced heating . in case of a barrier consisting of mao , the tms ratio of about @xmath59 as well as the seebeck coefficients are consistent with findings of other groups who used similar materials .",
    "the results of the mgo based mtjs show large tmr ratios of up to @xmath60 and tms ratios of around @xmath61 .",
    "this tms ratio is directly related to the different cofeb composition .",
    "in addition , we have studied the symmetry of i / v characteristics within the framework of the intrinsic tms proposed by zhang , teixeira et al .",
    "both , antisymmetric and symmetric contributions , revealed deviations from the expected linear behavior suggested by the model of the intrinsic tms .",
    "our findings show that it is not possible to consistently compare the results of laser induced and intrinsic tms .",
    "nevertheless , the brinkman model offers an alternative way to explain the occurring features if no @xmath11 symmetry filter effect is present , giving a consistent explanation for the observed symmetric contribution .",
    "in particular , we found that the symmetric i / v contribution in the parallel case is solely influenced by the barrier asymmetry .",
    "thus , we conclude that the symmetry analysis is not suitable to unambiguously identify an intrinsic tms .",
