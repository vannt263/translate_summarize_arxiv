    "great progress in answering these questions has been achieved in the past few years with the systematic study of early - type galaxies acting as strong gravitational lenses . for these systems",
    ", strong lensing provides an absolutely calibrated measurement of mass at a fiducial radius ( the einstein radius ) , which is typically comparable in size to the effective radius . by combining this mass tracer with traditional diagnostics such as stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , and stellar mass maps from multicolor imaging and/or spectroscopy",

    "this `` bulge - halo conspiracy '' , similar to the disk - halo conspiracy found for spiral galaxies @xcite , has implications both for lensing studies but also for galaxy formation studies .",
    "since the total mass density profile is preserved by dry - mergers @xcite , and dark matter - only profiles are not isothermal @xcite , the isothermal nature has to be established through dissipational processes ( , * ? ?",

    "evolution of @xmath133 with redshift .",
    "the ratio of @xmath133 tends to increase with redshift . ]    before interpreting this result , and its implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies , it is important to address a potential source of systematic error .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : reinreff_zd ] , the ratio of @xmath133 increases with redshift , mainly because the physical size of @xmath103 increases with redshift ( as discussed in section  [ sect : prevsamples ] ) , but also because of the increasing source redshift . since the slope of the total mass density",
    "is determined by measuring the total mass at two different radii , one of which is the einstein radius , sl2s lenses sample @xmath11 at larger radii than slacs lenses .",
    "therefore , a trend in @xmath133 with redshift could mimic the inferred evolution of @xmath11 . however , for this effect to mimic the evolution of @xmath11 , the density profile would have to become shallower and then steeper with increasing radius , which is unlikely given the total mass density profile of local early - type galaxies .",
    "we also note that @xmath11 and @xmath17 vary differently with cosmic time , which is unexpected if the evolution being mimicked by a trend in @xmath133 with redshift .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ section : gammald ] and  [ section : fdm ] , figures  [ fig : gammaexplore ] and  [ fig : fdmexplore ] show that both @xmath11 and @xmath17 show a negligible trend with @xmath133 , suggesting that the evolution of @xmath11 is not an artifact due to a dependence on @xmath133 .    for these reasons",
    "we conclude that true evolution of the average mass density profile is the most likely interpretation of our findings , although additional measurements of @xmath11 at different radii are needed to conclusively rule out alternate interpretations .",
    "it is important to stress that both the mean value and evolution of @xmath11 are completely consistent with previous results , @xmath177@xmath178@xmath55@xmath179 and @xmath12@xmath2@xmath180 @xcite .",
    "it is only by virtue of our larger sample that we have been able to reduce the error bars and find marginal evidence for evolution .",
    "if this evidence for evolution is confirmed by larger samples , it would indicate that growth of massive galaxies since @xmath14 has not occurred through dry ( dissipationless ) mergers alone , since they preserve @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in dissipative merging events , @xmath11 increases as a result of baryons cooling and sinking towards the center .",
    "therefore , dissipative processes would be required to contribute , at least partially , to the evolution of early - type galaxies since @xmath14 . although they can not be the dominant process , because of tight limits on recent star formation in massive early - type galaxies since @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our result seems to suggest that they can not be completely neglected either .",
    "this is consistent with evidence for a `` frosting '' of recent stars found in detailed studies of the stellar populations of massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another notable feature of the sl2s @xmath11 distribution is its large intrinsic scatter .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the slacs sample is just 0.16@xmath950.02 @xcite , compared to @xmath5 for sl2s . from the lsd lenses , @xcite also found that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath11 was larger at @xmath181 .",
    "this may indicate an overall trend toward more complete dynamical relaxation over gyr timescales , and perhaps a reduced contribution of external convergence , due to line of sight structure in nearby systems , where the einstein radii are smaller .",
    "again , a larger sample size is required to confirm this interpretation . finally , we find that the dark matter fraction within half of the effective radius has decreased slightly with cosmic time .",
    "this is again consistent with some contribution from dissipational processes in early - type galaxy formation and evolution , where baryons move to the central region as they cool .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind residual uncertainties in estimating the stellar mass , which may be redshift dependent , since the average age of the stellar populations is a function of cosmic time . cosmic evolution of the imf would be another source of ambiguity in interpreting these results @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", we have developed a new method to estimate source redshifts , in the absence of spectroscopic measurements .",
    "the method is completely general , does not require accurate multiband photometry of the sources , and allows us to infer @xmath11 and @xmath17 with errors that are just 2 - 3 times as large as if we had spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "although spectroscopic redshifts are in general preferable , this may be a good strategy for exploiting future surveys of thousands of strong lenses , where wholesale spectroscopy of the complete sample may not be practical .",
    "new spectroscopic measurements with deflector redshifts and velocity dispersions were presented for 11 lenses .",
    "these spectroscopic measurements were combined with lens models and photometry , described in , to infer the total density slope and dark matter fraction of each of the 11 sl2s galaxies in the final sample .      1 .",
    "the sl2s sample has a median deflector redshift , @xmath109@xmath2@xmath182 , source redshift , @xmath52@xmath2@xmath183 and velocity dispersion , @xmath115@xmath2@xmath184  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the sl2s , slacs and lsd lenses are the same types of galaxies , however , the physical size of @xmath103 is generally larger for higher redshift deflectors .",
    "we developed a new method to estimate the source redshift probability distribution function for lenses with no spectroscopic @xmath52 .",
    "this lack of accurate source redshift produces uncertainties on @xmath11 and @xmath17 that are only a factor 2 - 3 greater .",
    "uncertainties would eventually further decrease with better multiband source photometry , and this would allow large samples of high redshift lenses to be analyzed in the next generation of cosmological surveys , where spectroscopy of all the systems may not be affordable .",
    "the average total density slope measured from the sl2s sample alone is : @xmath158@xmath2@xmath3 , with a scatter of @xmath5 .",
    "5 .   combining the sl2s @xmath11 measurements with previous analyses from slacs and lsd",
    ", we find , @xmath158@xmath2@xmath162 , @xmath12@xmath2@xmath13 , and  @xmath131@xmath2@xmath163 .",
    "this suggests ( at approximately the 2-@xmath15 level ) that the mean total density profile of massive galaxies has become slightly steeper over cosmic time .",
    "stellar masses were estimated using cfht photometry , and enabled us to disentangle the total and stellar masses . 7 .   from this we inferred the dark matter fraction within half the effective radius : @xmath167@xmath2@xmath168 , with a scatter @xmath171@xmath2@xmath172 for the sl2s sample , using a @xcite imf .",
    "the combined dark matter fractions from all three samples suggest that the dark matter fraction within @xmath6 has decreased slightly since @xmath14 .",
    "we find the mean dark matter fraction within @xmath6 , gradient of evolution over cosmic time and scatter to be : @xmath167@xmath2@xmath173 , @xmath169@xmath2@xmath174 , and @xmath171@xmath2@xmath175 , respectively .",
