    "this paper deals with basic concepts of algebraic topology , such as covering maps , fundamental group , homology of coverings , @xmath1 and asphericity , and it is mainly based on the following simple idea . instead of working with simplicial coverings of polyhedra",
    ", one can regard regular cw - complexes as posets ( the posets of their cells ) , or equivalently , as @xmath2-spaces , and work with coverings of posets .",
    "the advantage of using poset coverings is that they can be handled combinatorially in a different and more tractable way than their simplicial analogues .",
    "this allows us to develop new methods and tools , which are based on the interaction between the topology and the combinatorics of posets , to study and compute classical invariants of cw - complexes , such as the low - dimensional homotopy groups .",
    "we prove for instance a generalization of van kampen s theorem , which describes the fundamental group of a regular cw - complex @xmath3 in terms of the fundamental group of each part in a  discrete decomposition \" of @xmath3 ( neither of these parts is necessarily an open or closed subspace of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we also present a generalization of hurewicz theorem for non - necessarily simply - connected complexes , and obtain new results on asphericity of @xmath4-complexes and group presentations  la reidemeister .",
    "the classical edge - path group @xmath5 of a simplicial complex @xmath3 describes combinatorially the fundamental group of @xmath3 in terms of paths in its @xmath6-skeleton .",
    "this concept can be translated into the context of posets resulting in a description of @xmath7 by edge - paths in the hasse diagram of the poset @xmath8 @xcite . in this article",
    "we use such a description just as a starting point .",
    "we introduce the notion of a coloring of a poset , which is a labeling @xmath9 of the edges in the hasse diagram of @xmath8 by elements in a given group @xmath0 , and use @xmath0-colorings to study covering maps . as a consequence",
    "we obtain a concrete presentation of the fundamental group of @xmath8 , more suitable than the description given by edge - paths .",
    "our classification of coverings in terms of @xmath0-colorings provides a new insight into the theory of coverings of polyhedra and it is the key point in this theory . there is a well - known and close relationship between the homotopy theory of polyhedra and partially ordered sets .",
    "to each simplicial complex @xmath3 one can associate the face poset @xmath10 and for each poset @xmath8 one can construct the order complex @xmath11 .",
    "the combinatorics of posets can be used to study topological properties of complexes by means of these two functors .",
    "examples of this interaction are quillen s work on the poset of @xmath12-subgroups of a finite group @xcite and chari s approach to forman s discrete morse theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the same direction ,",
    "the interplay between the combinatorics of posets and the topology of polyhedra has been used in @xcite to investigate simple homotopy types of complexes and in @xcite to give an alternative proof and applications of quillen s theorem a for posets .",
    "any poset can be seen as a topological space , more precisely as an alexandroff space ( or @xmath2-space for short ) , without necessity of using the functors @xmath13 and @xmath14 : the open sets of @xmath8 are its order ideals .",
    "mccord proved that the topology of such spaces is closely related to the topology of their associated complexes @xmath11 .",
    "concretely , there is weak equivalence @xmath15 and in particular these two spaces have the same homology and homotopy groups @xcite . in the appendix",
    "we prove that the functors @xmath13 and @xmath14 induce a one - to - one correspondence between equivalence classes of coverings of posets and equivalence classes of coverings of simplicial complexes .",
    "a poset can also be regarded as a category with at most one morphism between any two objects ( the order complex @xmath11 is just the classifying space of the category @xmath8 ) .",
    "this provides an alternative way to understand the connection between topological and combinatorial properties .",
    "we study coverings of posets viewed as a - spaces and as categories , and show that the topological notion of covering coincides with the categorical one .",
    "the notion of covering of a category that we use extends the classical notion of a groupoid covering ( see @xcite ) and it is the analogue to the definition of a covering of a @xmath16-category @xcite .",
    "these results are presented in the appendix as well .    in section [ colorings ]",
    "we characterize regular coverings of posets in terms of colorings .",
    "the class of _ admissible _ and _ connected _",
    "@xmath0-colorings plays an important role in this theory .",
    "these colorings classify the normal subgroups of the fundamental group of the poset whose quotients are isomorphic to @xmath0 . concretely , we prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath8 be a connected locally finite poset , @xmath17 and @xmath0 a group .",
    "there exists a correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of admissible connected @xmath0-colorings of @xmath8 and the set of normal subgroups @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "in particular there is a direct connection between @xmath0-colorings of @xmath8 and equivalence classes of regular coverings of @xmath8 with deck transformation group isomorphic to @xmath0 . in theorem [ main2 ]",
    "we give the explicit construction of the corresponding covering .    in section [ presentacion ]",
    "we use the characterization of coverings in terms of colorings to find an alternative description of the fundamental group of posets ( and of simplicial complexes ) .",
    "we exhibit various examples and applications of this new characterization .",
    "for instance , we deduce the generalization of van kampen s theorem mentioned above ( theorem [ nuestrovk ] ) .",
    "we also characterize , in terms of colorings , the posets with abelian fundamental group .",
    "in section [ maps ] we use colorings to study maps between the fundamental groups . in section [ seccionpidos ]",
    "we use our characterization of regular coverings in terms of colorings and the description of the fundamental group obtained in section [ presentacion ] , together with a result of @xcite , to compute the homology of coverings using colorings . as a consequence",
    "we obtain a novel description of the second homotopy group @xmath20 of any _ cellular poset @xmath8 .",
    "the class of cellular posets includes for example all posets whose associated simplicial complexes @xmath11 are closed homological manifolds and it also includes the face posets of regular cw - complexes .",
    "in particular we obtain an alternative description of @xmath21 of any complex .",
    "we concentrate then on posets of height @xmath4 ( corresponding to two - dimensional cw - complexes ) . for these posets",
    "the description of @xmath1 is easier to handle and we exhibit explicit formulae for its computation .",
    "we show various examples to illustrate our methods .",
    "to put our results in perspective , one should recall that it is an open problem , originally posted by whitehead , whether any subcomplex of an aspherical @xmath4-dimensional cw - complex is itself aspherical ( a connected @xmath4-complex @xmath3 is aspherical if @xmath22 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on whitehead s asphericity question . applying these methods",
    ", we obtain a formula for the second homotopy group of a wedge and a generalization of the classical hurewicz theorem for dimension two .",
    "concretely we prove the following _    let @xmath8 be a connected cellular poset of height @xmath4 and let @xmath23 be the graph consisting of the edges between the points of height @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( and the vertices of these edges ) . if the inclusion of each component of @xmath23 in @xmath8 induces the trivial map on fundamental groups , then @xmath20 is a free @xmath24$]-module with the same rank as the free @xmath25-module @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath8 is simply - connected , this is the hurewicz theorem for dimension @xmath4 .",
    "since the class of cellular posets includes the face posets of regular cw - complexes , this result can be restated in terms of complexes ( see corollary [ cororegular ] ) and has a generalization to any dimension :    let @xmath3 be a connected regular cw - complex . if every closed edge - path of the barycentric subdivision @xmath27 containing only vertices which are barycenters of @xmath6 , @xmath4 or @xmath28-dimensional simplices , is equivalent to the trivial edge - path , then @xmath29\\otimes h_2(k)$ ] .",
    "we also derive a result which provides sufficient conditions for a two - dimensional cw - complex to be aspherical .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath4-dimensional regular cw - complex and let @xmath27 be its barycentric subdivision . consider the full ( one - dimensional ) subcomplex @xmath30 spanned by the barycenters of the @xmath4-cells of @xmath3 and the barycenters of the @xmath6-cells which are faces of exactly two @xmath4-cells .",
    "suppose that for every connected component @xmath31 of @xmath32 , @xmath33 contains an element of infinite order , where @xmath34 is the map induced by the inclusion .",
    "then @xmath3 is aspherical .",
    "this result generalizes the well - known fact that all compact surfaces different from @xmath35 and @xmath36 are aspherical . as a corollary",
    "we obtain a result which provides sufficient conditions for asphericity of group presentations , resembling in some sense the homological description of @xmath1 in terms of reidemeister chains .    in the last section of the paper we consider a combinatorial problem related with boards on surfaces .",
    "in this section we recall the basic notions on @xmath2-spaces , their relationship with posets and simplicial complexes , and the description of their fundamental group in terms of edge - paths . for more details",
