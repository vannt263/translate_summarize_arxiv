    "a convex polyhedron @xmath0 is the intersection of half - spaces of the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 .",

    "when @xmath0 is the orthant @xmath7 in @xmath2 , the probability is called the orthant probability and can be regarded as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by the inclusion  exclusion identity given in @xcite and @xcite , the probability content of the convex polyhedron can be written as a linear combination of the orthant probabilities .",
    "for this reason , the literature includes many discussions of methods for evaluating the orthant probabilities .",

    "the motivation of our study is to evaluate the probability content of a convex polyhedron by a completely different and novel approach that uses the holonomic gradient method ( hgm ) proposed in @xcite .",

    ", we provided a holonomic system and a pfaffian equation that is associated with the orthant probability .",
    "our pfaffian equation corresponds with the reduction formula in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",

    "we also show that the holonomic rank of the system is equal to the number of nonempty faces of the polyhedron @xmath0 .",
