    "atoms have been successfully converted into molecules whose condensation has also been achieved @xcite . more recently , feshbach resonances between different atomic species @xcite have been observed , leading to the potential production of heteronuclear molecules .    in this context the question arises how the quantum statistics of the composing atoms influence the molecule formation process .",

    "in this paper we analyze molecule formation in quantum gas mixtures of atoms of all possible combinations of statistics .",
    "we find that at the level of molecule _ numbers _ the molecule formation dynamics looks very similar in all three cases and that differences due to the different quantum statistics only show up in higher order correlation functions .",
    "we are therefore led to calculate the full counting statistics of the molecular fields which is a computationally hard problem , but contains complete information about the molecule number and all its moments .",

    "@xcite , noise correlation experiments in the spatial domain have been used to measure the second - order coherence function of pair - correlated atoms from molecular dissociation @xcite and from an optical lattice in the mott insulator regime @xcite .",
    "we focus on molecule production in a two - step process consisting of both a magnetic feshbach resonance and photoassociation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use a two - photon raman process to transfer the closed - channel molecules  to which the free atoms are coupled through the hyperfine interaction  to a much more stable deeply - bound state , where they are not so prone to three - body losses .",
    "this method is similar to the recent experiment by partridge _",
    "@xcite , in which optical spectroscopy was used to probe the two - body state of paired @xmath0li atoms near a feshbach resonance .",
    "one difference , however , is that we are considering here the raman transfer inside an optical cavity that allows to select the final vibrational state of the molecules .",
    "we investigate the cases where the molecules are produced from atomic condensates , from a mixture of bosons and fermions , as well as from fermions . in all cases the atomic sample",
    "is assumed to be at temperature @xmath1 , and in the case of fermions we consider both the case of a normal fermi gas and of a superfluid system .",
    "we derive master equations that describe the molecule formation process in the presence of cavity losses . for small particle numbers",
    ", these equations can be solved numerically in the single mode approximation for bosons and the degenerate approximation for fermions .",
    "thus , we find the full counting statistics of the molecules @xcite .    we compare these numerical results to a perturbative analysis of the correlation functions and to mean - field calculations valid for short times .",
    "they show good agreement with the full numerical solutions of the master equations in the limit of large particle numbers .",
    "we find that the qualitative features of the molecule production _ rates _ are similar in all cases .",
    "as has been previously demonstrated e.g.  for the case of four - wave mixing @xcite , this is because the formation of superradiant collective states in fermions with fermi energies @xmath2 at times short compared to the dephasing time @xmath3 leads to similar effects as the bose enhancement for bosons .",
    "significant differences are , however , evident in the full counting _ statistics _ presented here . atomic condensates and bose - fermi mixtures",
    "lead to coherent molecule statistics in the intermediate state , whereas normal fermi gases lead to molecule statistics similar to those of a thermal field .",
    "the coherence properties of molecules formed from two superfluid fermi gases is intermediate between the two .",
    "the second - order coherence of the deeply - bound molecules is particularly interesting , as this field is twice as noisy as that of the intermediate state .",
    "the additional noise finds its origin in the vacuum fluctuations of the cavity field , a situation somewhat analogous to that of an optical beam splitter , where vacuum noise is injected through the empty input port .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses the case of molecule formation from condensed bosonic atoms and shows in particular that the optical cavity acts as an input port for quantum noise that increases the quantum fluctuations of the molecular field .",
    "section iii addresses the case of feshbach - assisted photoassociation from a bose - fermi mixture that consists of a bec and a degenerate fermi gas and shows that under appropriate circumstances that system can be mapped to the previous situation of two heteronuclear becs . in section",

    "we consider first the feshbach - assisted photoassociation of condensates of bosonic atoms of species @xmath4 and @xmath5 into molecules .",
    "the atoms are prepared in a two component bose - einstein condensate . a sudden change of the magnetic field strength projects the scattering state of two free atoms onto the tunable molecular state .",

    "dominated feshbach resonances a strong coupling between open and closed channel leads to molecular states which are predominately in the open channel and thus have a substantial overlap with the wavefunctions of free atomic pairs .",
    "this explains the large coherent atom - molecule oscillations such as in the ramsey - type experiments @xcite . in narrow resonances outside the universal regime",
    "the molecular state is mostly in the closed channel which reduces its size compared to the very weakly - bound molecules in broad resonances but has some open channel admixture which ensures that the molecular state is not orthogonal to the free atom scattering states . for a detailed discussion of molecular production in feshbach resonances we refer to @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that the molecular state can be approximately described by a quantum field satisfying bosonic commutation relations .",
    "this procedure is valid since the density @xmath6 and the molecular size i.e.  range of the molecular wavefunction @xmath7 satisfy @xmath8 .",
    "the free atom pairs with total spin configuration @xmath9 are coupled to closed - channel molecules with spin state @xmath10 .",

    "usually , these corrections are very small with the dominant physics well captured by the single mode approximation we use in this paper . for fermions",
    "repulsive interactions lead to very minor quantitative changes that are hard to distinguish from excitations due to finite temperature .",
    "attractive interactions between fermionic species on the other hand give rise to the bcs phase transition and we have included them in the framework of the bcs mean field theory . atom - molecule interactions and interactions between atoms of the two different atomic species may lead to phase seperation @xcite . for",
    "closed - channel dominated resonances however the background scattering is usually neglectable if the system is tuned close to the resonance @xcite .",
    "inelastic collisions give rise to losses which can easily be incorporated in our formalism through a phenomenological damping term , e.g.  in eq .",
    "( [ bose_mean ] ) .",
    "calculations of the full counting statistics , however , become much harder numerically , as eq .",
    "( [ number_conservation ] ) ceases to hold .",
    "it is worth noting that losses have no effect on our conclusions which are concerned with the short time properties of the molecule formation process .",
    "thus , we are justified in omitting them .",
    "the second - order coherence properties of the final ground state molecules are further influenced by their coupling to a lossy optical cavity that acts as an input port for quantum noise , in a fashion reminiscent of the role of the empty input port in an optical beam splitter .",
    "this process , which is dominated by vacuum fluctuations , results in an additional factor of two enhancement in the second order coherence @xmath137 , both for bosonic and fermionic gases .",
    "future work will extend our model to take into account non - condensed modes of the bosonic fields .",
    "this will allow us to study finite temperature effects as well as dynamical depletion of the condensate in the course of the molecule formation .",
    "furthermore , we will use a more detailed description of the two - body physics .",
    "in doing so we hope to be able to study the effects of a time - varying detuning , which is necessary to adequately describe sweep experiments .",
