    "<S> a sample of 7253 @xmath0 decay candidates with 1.0% background contamination has been collected by the na48/2 experiment at the cern sps , which allowed a precise measurement of the decay properties . the branching ratio in the full kinematic range was measured to be @xmath1 , where the uncertainty includes also the model dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the form factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , was parameterized according to several models , and , in particular , the slope @xmath4 of the linear form factor @xmath5 was determined to be @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a possible cp violating asymmetry of @xmath7 and @xmath8 decay widths was investigated , and a conservative upper limit of @xmath9 at 90% cl was established .    </S>",
