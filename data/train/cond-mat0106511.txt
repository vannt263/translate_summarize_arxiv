    "in recent decades , there has been considerable interest in the study of strongly correlated electron systems in reduced dimensions exhibiting non - fermi - liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "this has been motivated by the surprising properties of high-@xmath2 superconductors @xcite , heavy - fermion alloys and compounds @xcite , and the concept of luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "similar non - standard behaviour that lies outside the realm of fermi liquid theory was also observed in the magnetic properties of systems displaying the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "the kondo problem was solved exactly by means of the bethe ansatz and the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite . following this approach ,",
    "many one - dimensional integrable quantum systems with impurities @xcite have been constructed as inhomogeneous solutions of the yang - baxter equations ( ybe ) @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing situation corresponds to perfect backscattering impurities which can be realized conveniently by integrable open boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "a systematic approach to handle quantum systems with backscattering boundaries is provided by sklyanin s work on the reflection equations ( re ) @xcite . in analogy with the ybe in the bulk ,",
    "the re guarantee the factorization of the scattering matrices at the boundaries .",
    "thus , starting from a solution of the ybe , which yields a solvable model with periodic bc , one constructs suitable integrable boundary conditions such that the re are fulfilled @xcite . due to integrability ,",
    "the bulk impurities obtained by inhomogeneous solutions of the ybe are pure forward scatterers .",
    "thus their combination with the backscattering boundaries may be expected to model physically relevant impurity systems . in the context of boundary integrable quantum field theories",
    "@xcite , a model with impurities can be mapped onto a model with certain boundary conditions . because impurity effects play a decisive role for the transport in quantum wires , general boundary conditions for strongly correlated electron systems open many opportunities to investigate the transport properties in luttinger liquids or quantum wires .",
    "a proper boundary field may have a feasible realization by applying boundary external voltages and external magnetic fields in experiments on quantum wires @xcite .",
    "moreover , we may expect that the local state induced by the boundary fields inherits signatures of the bulk luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "the physical quantities such as magnetization , the compressibility , susceptibility , and specific heat , etc .",

    "models corresponding to non - exceptional lie superalgebras as , for instance , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , have provided interesting non - perturbative information @xcite for generalizations of well - known models such as , e.g. , the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "a further generalization was achieved by considering the solution of the ybe related to the quantum superalgebra @xmath0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this model has two fermionic and two bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian @xcite corresponds to a lattice regularization of the integrable double sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "the continuum version of this model with boundary fields is known to describe tunneling effects in quantum wires @xcite .",
    "these wires are believed to represent a realization of luttinger liquids .",
    "we remark that the coordinate bethe ansatz for an open @xmath0 $ ] chain has recently been studied @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform the algebraic bethe ansatz for a supersymmetric open chain associated with the quantum superalgebra @xmath0 $ ] . due to the supersymmetric structure of the model , we use the graded version of the qism @xcite .",
    "starting from the @xmath0 $ ] solution of the graded ybe , we construct a supersymmetric correlated electron system with boundary fields by solving the graded re .",
    "we find that the model contains a hidden anisotropic xxz open chain characterizing the spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this plays a crucial role in our solution , which proceeds in two steps , treating charge and spin degrees of freedom separately by a nested graded bethe ansatz .",
    "this structure also suggests a natural way to incorporate impurities coupling to charge and spin degrees of freedom while preserving the integrability of the model . from the bethe - ansatz equations , we obtain the ground state energy at half - filling in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we also discuss integrable impurities coupled to the boundaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we present the @xmath0 $ ] solution of the ybe and solve the corresponding re .",
    "furthermore , we give an explicit expression of the hamiltonian in terms of fermionic operators .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation and the solution of the bethe - ansatz equations by means of the graded qism . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit is obtained for the model with boundary fields and impurities .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we begin by considering a two dimensional classical lattice model , where , to each bond of the lattice , two bosonic and two fermionic degrees of freedom are associated .",
    "it is a vertex model , hence interaction takes place at each vertex , and the energies of the various local configurations determine the statistical weight of the configuration .",

    "for other bc such as twisted and open bc , the graded ybe will still account for the bulk part of the model , but the boundary terms have to be chosen appropriately in order to preserve the integrability of the model . in particular , solutions of the re yield integrable vertex models with open ( reflecting ) boundaries or the equivalent integrable quantum spin chains with boundary fields . in the context of two - body scattering ,",
