    "heavy quark production in high energy collisions is important for a number of reasons .",
    "one of them is that it offers a good testing ground for perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations , which in spite of the continuous progress over the last thirty years , still contain some ambiguities , mostly related to scale dependence of the observable quantities . in the context of pqcd",
    "there are different calculation schemes .",
    "the most well known is the collinear factorization approach , which has been developed up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more recently the fixed order plus next - to - leading - log ( fonll ) @xcite was developed .",
    "it resumes large perturbative terms proportional to powers of @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the heavy quark transverse momentum and mass , respectively . in these calculations all particles involved",
    "are assumed to be on mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and the cross section is averaged over two transverse polarizations of the incident gluons .",
    "the virtualities @xmath4 of the initial partons are taken into account only through their structure functions .",
    "the formalism which incorporates the incident parton transverse momenta is referred to as the @xmath5-factorization approach @xcite . in this approach",
    "the feynman diagrams are calculated taking into account the virtualities and all possible polarizations of the incident partons . in the @xmath5-factorization approach",
    "the unintegrated gluon distributions are used instead of the usual structure functions .    in proton nucleus collisions",
    "the linear a - dependence of the heavy flavor production cross sections is usually assumed , so the obtained results are discussed in terms of the cross section scaled to pp collision . in perturbative",
    "qcd with the factorization approximation , heavy ion collisions differ from p - p collisions only by the change of the usual nucleon structure functions or unintegrated gluon distributions by the same functions for bound nucleons . at rhic energies",
    "the difference between bound and unbound parton structure functions is known from emc and nmc experimental data and their dglap evolution analysis . from these studies",
    "we have learned that nuclear effects in charm production at rhic cause a deviation of @xmath6 % from the linear ( a - dependent ) predictions .",
    "the experimental data of the phenix @xcite collaboration obtained at rhic both from pp and nuclear collisions are in reasonable agreement with the nlo qcd and with the @xmath5 factorization approach predictions . the existing star @xcite collaboration data are in contradiction with the phenix data and with standard qcd calculations .",
    "however a reanalysis of these data is in progress .",
    "calculations performed with other approaches , also based on pqcd , are welcome and may be very useful to cross - check and complement previous analyses . in this paper",
    "we calculate heavy quark production cross sections using a formalism derived from the high energy regime of qcd ( for recent reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this regime",
    ", perturbative qcd predicts that the small-@xmath7 gluons in a hadron wavefunction should form a color glass condensate ( cgc ) , which is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction ( parton saturation ) , with the transition being specified by a typical scale , which is energy dependent and is called saturation scale @xmath8 . in order to estimate the saturation effects we study heavy quark production using the color dipole approach , which gives a simple and unified picture of this process in photon - hadron and hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in contrast to the heavy quark production in the previous accelerators ( sps , tevatron and rhic ) , where the saturation scale @xmath8 is smaller than the typical hard scale , @xmath9 , at the lhc energies , we probe for the first time the kinematical regime where @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , at these energies one may expect a sizeable modification of the heavy quark total cross sections and rapidity distributions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section ( section [ cross ] )",
    "we present a brief review of the heavy quark production in the color dipole formalism , introducing the main formulae . in section [ dinamica ]",
    "we discuss the qcd dynamics and the models used in the calculations . in section [ resultados ] we present our predictions for the total cross sections and rapidity distributions for heavy quark production in @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "heavy quark hadroproduction at high energies has been usually described considering the collinear factorization , where all partons involved are assumed to be on mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and their transverse momenta are neglected in the qcd matrix elements .",
    "the cross sections of the qcd subprocess are usually calculated in leading order ( lo ) , as well as in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "in particular , the cross sections involving incoming hadrons are given , at all orders , by the convolution of intrinsically non - perturbative ( but universal ) quantities - the parton densities - with perturbatively calculable hard matrix elements , which are process dependent .",
    "the conventional gluon distribution @xmath13 , which drives the behavior of the observables at high energies , corresponds to the density of gluons in the proton having a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath7 at the factorization scale @xmath14 .",
    "this distribution satisfies the dglap evolution in @xmath15 and does not contain information about the transverse momentuum @xmath5 of the gluon . on the other hand , in the large energy ( small-@xmath7 ) limit ,",
    "the characteristic scale @xmath14 of the hard subprocess of parton scattering is much less than @xmath16 , but greater than the @xmath17 parameter . in this limit ,",
    "the effects of the finite transverse momenta of the incoming partons become important , and the factorization must be generalized , implying that the cross sections are now @xmath5-factorized into an off - shell partonic cross section and a @xmath5-unintegrated parton density function @xmath18 , characterizing the @xmath5-factorization approach . the function @xmath19 is obtained as a solution of the evolution equation associated to the dynamics that governs qcd at high energies .",
    "several authors have considered the @xmath5-factorization approach in order to analyse some observables and they have obtained a better description of these quantities than the one obtained with the collinear approach . however , the current situation is still not satisfactory , due to the large uncertainty associated to the lack of a complete knowledge of the unintegrated gluon distribution . in particular , at high energies the non - linear qcd effects associated to the gluon saturation are expected to contribute significantly and this leads to the breakdown of the twist expansion and of the factorization schemes .",
    "gluon saturation effects can be naturally described in the color dipole formalism . at high energies color dipoles with a defined transverse separation",
    "are eigenstates of the interaction .",
    "the main quantity in this formalism is the dipole - target cross section , which is universal and determined by qcd dynamics at high energies . in particular",
    ", it provides an unified description of inclusive and diffractive observables in @xmath20 processes as well as for in drell - yan , prompt photon and heavy quark production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "furthermore , an important advantage of this formalism is that it is very simple to include nuclear effects ( see below ) .    in the color dipole formalism",
    "the total cross section for the process @xmath21 , where @xmath22 or @xmath23 , is given by @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the projectile gluon distribution , the cross section @xmath26 describes the heavy quark production in the gluon - target interaction , @xmath27 is the rapidity of the pair and @xmath28 is the factorization scale , which we assume to be given by @xmath29 .",
    "the proton gluon distribution will be taken from the set of parton densities grv98 @xcite , but similar predictions are obtained using e.g. the cteq6l parameterization .",
    "( [ sigtot ] ) can be easily interpreted in the target rest frame , where heavy quark production looks like pair creation in the target color field . for a short time , a gluon g from the projectile hadron can develop a fluctuation which contains a heavy quark pair ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the interaction with the color field of the target may then release these heavy quarks .",
    "this mechanism corresponds to the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism of heavy quark production in the leading order ( lo ) parton model .",
    "the dipole formulation is therefore applicable only at low @xmath7 , where the gluon density of the target is much larger than all quark densities .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for the charm and bottom production at the cern - lhc .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scattering cross section of a color neutral quark - antiquark - gluon system on the hadron target @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath35 - \\frac{1}{8}\\sigma _ { q\\bar{q}}(\\rho)\\,\\ , .   \\label{sec2}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath36 is the scattering cross section of a color neutral quark - antiquark pair with separation radius @xmath37 on the target and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the fractional momentum of quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the light - cone ( lc ) wavefunction of the transition @xmath40 can be calculated perturbatively , with the squared wavefunction given by : @xmath41 m^2_q k_1 ^ 2(m_q\\rho)\\rbrace \\label{psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the strong coupling constant , which is computed at a renormalization scale @xmath43 , which we assume to be equal to quark mass , and it is given by : @xmath44 another observable of interest is the rapidity distribution , which in the dipole formalism is expressed as : @xmath45 before discussing the qcd dynamics at high energies in the next section , some comments are in order .",
    "first , in the dipole formalism we work in a mixed representation , where the longitudinal direction is treated in momentum space , while the transverse directions are described in the coordinate space representation .",
    "second , in ref .",
    "@xcite the equivalence between this approach and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism of the conventional collinear factorization at leading order and twist has been demonstrated .",
    "in particular , the dipole predictions are similar to those obtained using the next - to - leading order parton model calculation .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ sigtot ] ) resums higher - twist corrections beyond the traditional factorization schemes .",
    "the main ingredient of the dipole formalism is the dipole - target cross section @xmath36 which is determined by the qcd dynamics . at leading logarithmic approximation it is directly related to the target gluon distribution @xmath46 as follows @xcite : @xmath47 which satisfies the property known as color transparency , i.e. @xmath48 vanishes @xmath49 at small separations .",
    "if we assume that @xmath46 is a solution of the dglap evolution equations , the use of this expression as input in our calculations implies that we are disregarding non - linear qcd effects , associated to the high gluon density present at small-@xmath7 ( large energies ) . in what follows",
    "we assume that the resulting predictions correspond to the linear qcd dynamics and denote them by ct in the plots . when the target is a proton we assume that the gluon distribution is given by the grv98 parametrization @xcite .",
    "if the target is a nucleus we will assume that @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the gluon distribution in the proton and @xmath52 given by the eps09 @xcite or ds @xcite parametrizations for the nuclear effects .",
    "in both cases we are disregarding multiple scatterings of the dipole with the nuclei and are assuming that the dipole interacts incoherently with the target .",
    "expression ( [ gluongrv ] ) was recently used in @xcite to give the linear physics predicitons for heavy quark production in @xmath53 collisions .",
    "the results from hera , rhic and more recently from the lhc suggest that @xmath20 and hadron - hadron interactions at high energies probe qcd in the non - linear regime of high parton densities , where the growth of parton distributions should saturate , possibly forming a color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "this formalism implies that the dipole - target cross section @xmath54 is given in terms of the dipole - target forward scattering amplitude @xmath55 , which encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",
    "it reads : @xmath56 it is useful to assume that the impact parameter dependence of @xmath57 can be factorized as @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being a free parameter related to the non - perturbative qcd physics .",
    "the balitsky - jimwlk hierarchy @xcite describes the energy evolution of the dipole - target scattering amplitude @xmath61 . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the first equation of this hierarchy decouples and boils down to the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .    in the last years the next - to - leading order corrections to the bk equation",
    "were calculated @xcite through the ressumation of @xmath62 contributions to all orders , where @xmath63 is the number of flavors .",
    "such calculation allows one to estimate the soft gluon emission and running coupling corrections to the evolution kernel .",
    "the authors have found out that the dominant contributions come from the running coupling corrections , which allow us to determine the scale of the running coupling in the kernel .",
    "the solution of the improved bk equation was studied in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental data , with the geometric scaling regime being reached only at ultra - high energies . in @xcite a global analysis of the small @xmath7 data for the proton structure function using the improved bk equation was performed ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast to the bk equation at leading logarithmic @xmath64 approximation , which fails to describe the hera data , the inclusion of running coupling effects in the evolution renders the bk equation compatible with them ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in what follows we consider the bk predictions for @xmath61 obtained using the gbw @xcite initial condition .",
    "the dipole - target cross section can also be calculated considering phenomenological parametrizations for @xmath61 based on saturation physics , which provide an economical description of a wide range of data with a few parameters .",
    "several models for the forward dipole cross section have been used in the literature in order to fit the hera and rhic data . in general , the dipole scattering amplitude is modelled in the coordinate space in terms of a simple glauber - like formula as follows @xmath65 \\,\\ , , \\label{ngeral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the anomalous dimension of the target gluon distribution .",
    "the main difference among the distinct phenomenological models comes from the predicted behaviour for the anomalous dimension , which determines the transition from the non - linear to the extended geometric scaling regimes , as well as from the extended geometric scaling to the dglap regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the current models in the literature consider the general form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the anomalous dimension at the saturation scale and @xmath69 mimics the onset of the geometric scaling region and dglap regime . in",
    "what follows we compare the rcbk @xcite predictions with those of the gbw model @xcite , which assumes @xmath70 .    in order to estimate heavy quark production in @xmath12 collisions",
    "we will use the fact that color dipoles are eigenstates of the interaction and therefore the @xmath71-nucleus interaction can be expressed in terms of the eikonalization of the cross section on a nucleon target : @xmath72 \\,\\ , , \\label{enenuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "( [ sec2 ] ) and @xmath74 is the nuclear profile function , which is obtained from a 3-parameter fermi distribution for the nuclear density normalized to @xmath23 .",
    "the above equation , based on the glauber - gribov formalism , sums up all the multiple elastic rescattering diagrams of the @xmath71 system and is justified for large coherence length , where the transverse separation @xmath37 of partons in the multiparton fock state of the projectile becomes a conserved quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ the size of the dipole becomes eigenvalue of the scattering matrix . in the next section",
    "we will estimate eq .",
    "( [ enenuc ] ) using as input the rcbk and gbw models for the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "moreover , we will compare these predictions with those obtained using the ct model generalized to the nuclear case .",
    "another issue that we will address is the asymmetry in heavy quark production in @xmath75 collisions when we use the color dipole formalism .",
    "our treatment of the interaction is not symmetric under the projectile - target exchange .",
    "in particular , @xmath75 and @xmath76 processes allow us to study different physical effects .",
    "while @xmath75 collisions allow to study non - linear effects in the dipole - nucleus interaction , the study of @xmath76 collisions probes the nuclear effects in the projectile gluon distribution .",
    "the rapidity distribution in the latter case is given by : @xmath77 as it can be seen , this process can be used to constrain the magnitude the shadowing and antishadowing effects , which is still an open question ( for a similar discussion in the drell - yan process see ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the description of heavy quark production is one the most important testing grounds for perturbative qcd .",
    "currently , there are several approaches which satisfactorily describe the available experimental data .",
    "however , it is still an open question whether standard pqcd works well at higher energies and in nuclear collisions . in this regime , the traditional factorization schemes based on a twist expansion ,",
    "are expected to breakdown due to the presence of saturation effects associated to the high parton density and all twists should be resummed . in this paper",
    "we have computed heavy quark production in @xmath11 and @xmath75 collisions considering the color dipole formalism , which allows to include saturation effects ( which are expected to be present at high energies and large nuclei ) . in particular , we analyse the energy dependence of the total cross section and the behaviour of the rapidity distribution at fixed energy considering two distinct approaches to treat the dipole - target interaction . one based on the non - linear qcd dynamics and another associated to the linear qcd dynamics .",
    "our results shown that the influence of the saturation or shadowing effects is different for charm and bottom production and therefore the simultaneous analyses of the associated observables can be useful to discriminate the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we analyse @xmath76 collisions as a probe of shadowing effects in nuclear gluon densities and demonstrate that the study of rapidity distributions should allow to constrain their magnitude .",
