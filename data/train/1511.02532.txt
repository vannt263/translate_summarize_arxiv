    "recently , topological properties of time - reversal - invariant band insulators in two and three dimensions have been extensively studied@xcite . a class of insulators preserving the time reversal symmetry is called topological insulators characterized by non - trivial topological invariants@xcite.the topological insulators",
    "have been intensively studied because of the existence and potential applications of robust surface metallic states .    both in two and three dimensions , the topological phases are typically realized in the systems with strong spin - orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "all the known topological insulators contain heavy or rare metal elements , such as bismuth or iridium , which poses constraints on the search for topological materials .",
    "irrespective of constitutents , ubiquitous mutual coulomb repulsions among electrons have been proposed to generate effective spin - orbit couplings  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that an extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin - orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the hartree - fock mean - field level leading to a topologically non - trivial phase@xcite . since the honeycomb - lattice system , which is dirac semimetals in the non - interacting limit , becomes a topologically nontrivial insulator driven by the coulomb interaction , this phase",
    "is often called a topological mott insulator ( tmi ) .",
    "this phenomenon is quite unusual not only because an emergent spin - orbit interaction appears from the electronic mutual coulomb interaction , but also it shows an unconventional quantum criticality that depends on the electron band dispersion near the fermi point@xcite .",
    "however , this proposed topological phase by utilizing the ubiquitous coulomb repulsions has not been achieved in real materials even though the tmi is proposed not only in various solids  @xcite but also in cold atoms loaded in optical lattices  @xcite . even in simple theoretical models such as extended hubbard models ,",
    "it is not clear whether the tmis become stable against competitions with other orders and quantum fluctuations .",
    "reliable examination of stable topological mott orders in the extended hubbard model is hampered by competing symmetry breakings such as cdws .",
    "couplings driving the topological mott transitions are also relevant to formations of a cdw , which has not been satisfactorily discussed in the previous studies . since the emergence of the tmi in the honeycomb lattice requires the coulomb repulsion between the next nearest neighbor sites , the long - period cdw instability must be considered on equal footing , which is not captured in the small - unit - cell mean - field ansatz employed in the previous studies .",
    "examining charge fluctuations with finite momentum over entire brillouin zones is an alternative way to clarify the competitions among tmis and cdws , as studied by employing functional renormalization group methods  @xcite .",
    "however , first order thermal or quantum phase transitions not characterized by diverging order - parameter fluctuations are hardly captured by such theoretical methods .",
    "the most plausible symmetry breking competing with tmis indeed occurs as a first order quantum phase transition as discussed later .",
    "the quantum many - body fluctuations beyond the mean - field approximation severely affects the stability of the tmi .",
    "the stability of the tmi and estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice has mainly been considered by mean - field calculations which can not treat the correlation effect satisfactorily .",
    "however , there exists a reliable limit where the tmi becomes stable : for infinitesimally small relevant coulomb repulsions , the quadratic band crossing with vanishing fermi velocities cause the leading instability toward the tmi , as extensively examined by using perturbative renormalization group methods@xcite .",
    "however , examining the instabilities toward the tmi in dirac semimetals requires elaborate theoretical treatments .    in this study , for clarification of the competitions among tmis and other symmetry breakings",
    ", we first examine the long - period cdw at the level of mean - field approximation that turns out to be much more stable compared to that of short period . indeed , this cdw severly competes the tmi on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the tmi on the honeycomb lattice studied in the literatures is consequently taken over by the cdw .    we , however , found a prescription to stabilize the tmis on the honeycomb lattice : by reducing the fermi velocity of the dirac cones , the tmi tends to be stabilized .",
    "we examine the realization of the tmis in the extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice by controlling the fermi velocity and employing a variational monte carlo method@xcite with many variational parameters@xcite , multi - variable variational monte carlo ( mvmc)@xcite , together with the mean - field approximation .",
    "finally , we found that , by suppressing the fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice , the tmi emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when we take many - body and quantum fluctuations into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model and method ] , we introduce an extended hubbard model and explain the order parameter of tmi .",
    "we also introduce the mvmc method . in section [ sec : stability ] , we first show how the long - range cdw becomes stable over the tmi phase in standard honeycomb lattice models .",
    "then we pursue the stabilization of tmi by modulating fermi velocity at the dirac cone at the mean - field level .",
    "finally we study by the mvmc method the effect of on - site coulomb interaction which was expected to unchange the stability of the tmi phase at the level of mean - field approximation .",

    "though this form of the wave function restricts itself to the hilbert subspace with the zero total @xmath38-component of @xmath14=@xmath15 , @xmath39 , it can describe topological phases on the honeycomb lattice as long as we use complex variables for @xmath36 . here ,",

    "we optimize the parameters by typically 2000 stochastic reconfiguration steps .      in the present implementation of the variational monte carlo method with complex variables ,",

    "when @xmath25 is small , @xmath28 empirically follows the size dependence @xmath90 with a constant @xmath91 as we see in fig.5(b ) .",

    "we note that the error bars arising from the statistical errors of the monte carlo sampling are much smaller .",
    "relatively large errorbars for small @xmath27 at @xmath94 is possiblly because of the existence of the critical point at a finite value of @xmath27 , which is about @xmath95 .",

    "although we expect that the mvmc results show larger critical values @xmath99 for the transition at @xmath100 , the estimated results indicate @xmath101 slightly smaller than the mean - field results shown in fig.[fig : mfphase ] .",
    "the reason that @xmath101 becomes smaller at @xmath100 in the mvmc results is probably an artifact arising from a peculiar size dependence near the essential singularity at @xmath102 , as we see even in the mean - field calculation shown in fig .",

    "first of all , as already studied above , the suppression of the fermi velocity of the dirac electrons is crucial for the stabilization of the tmis .",

    "if we neglect longer - ranged coulomb repulsions , we expect the nel or cdw orders by employing these crpa estimates of @xmath119 , and @xmath25 in graphene and tblg .",
    "therefore , the free - standing graphene and tblg do not offer a suitable platform for the tmis .",
    "however , by choosing dielectric substrates , the strength of the coulomb repulsions , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , is suppressed due to enhancement of dielectric constant as @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is defined by dielectric constants of each materials as @xmath125 .",

    "we found that the cdw of the 6 sublattice unit cell is much more stable than the previously estimated cdw with smaller unit cells for the simplest case where the electronic transfer is limited to the nearest neighbor pair .",
    "for the stabilization of the tmi we need to suppress the fermi velocity at the dirac point than the standard dirac dispersion for the case with only the nearest neighbor transfer . in the case of the honeycomb lattice , this is realized by introducing the third neighbor hopping @xmath20 and we have given quantitative criteria for the emergence of the tmi .",

    "actually , the quadratic band crossing is realized when the rotation angle is @xmath67 ( known as the ab stacking bilayer graphene@xcite ) , which is mimicked by @xmath136 . since smaller values of fermi velocity stabilizes the tmi at smaller values of @xmath27 ,",
    "its effective control may offer a breakthrough in the realization of two dimensional tmis .",
    "we need further analyses for experimental methods of controlling the stability of the tmis and _ ab initio _ quantitative estimates of the stability for bilayer graphenes , which are intriguing future subjects of our study .",

    "<S> realization and design of topological insulators emerging from electron correlations , called topological mott insulators ( tmis ) , is pursued by using mean - field approximations as well as multi - variable variational monte carlo ( mvmc ) methods for dirac electrons on honeycomb lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the topological insulator phases predicted in the previous studies by the mean - field approximation for an extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice turn out to disappear , when we consider the possibility of a long - period charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order taking over the tmi phase . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we further show that the tmi phase is still stabilized when we are able to tune the fermi velocity of the dirac point of the electron band . beyond the limitation of the mean - field calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the newly developed mvmc to make accurate predictions after including the many - body and quantum fluctuations . by taking the extrapolation to the thermodynamic and weak external field limit </S>",
    "<S> , we present realistic criteria for the emergence of the topological insulator caused by the electron correlations . by suppressing the fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the topological insulator emerges in an extended region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking surviving competitions with other orders . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss experimental ways to realize it in a bilayer graphenesystem . </S>"
