    "the measurement of the neutrino mass is a fundamental , unsolved problem in elementary particle physics .",
    "indeed , the neutrino is the only particle in the standard model whose basic symmetry property under charge conjugation is still unknown : if a neutrino were a majorana particle then it would be equal to its own antiparticle and described by the majorana equation , which is manifestly different from the dirac equation . here , we present a proposal , based on a specific beamline design , for the measurement of the mass of the muon neutrino flavor eigenstate , henceforth referred to as the muon neutrino mass .",
    "our proposal relies on a short baseline of 110 km , which simplifies the distance and time measurements as compared to long base - line experiments . in this paper",
    ", we aim to present a sketch of the beamline design that would be required to improve current limits on the neutrino mass , as well as a concise discussion of the theoretical questions and concepts which could be elucidated using the apparatus . indeed , our proposal first and foremost is based on an improved measurement of the neutrino time of flight ( tof ) , involving the use of a laser pulse as a reference signal , but its final aim is to convert the tof measurement into a measurement of the neutrino mass .    in the original standard model ,",
    "all neutrinos were assumed to be massless particles ( weyl fermions ) , transforming according to the fundamental @xmath0 and @xmath1 representations of the lorentz group .",
    "neutrino oscillations were first observed in the deviations of the ratio of solar muon and electron neutrino fluxes from theoretical predictions .",
    "laboratory - based studies confirmed the solar data  @xcite and fundamentally altered the physical picture : neutrinos can not be massless .",
    "moreover , their mass eigenstates can not be equal to their flavor eigenstates .",
    "in general , one assumes that in nuclear reactions neutrinos are originally produced in flavor eigenstates that are superpositions of mass eigenstates .",
    "the mixing is described by the pontecorvo ",
    " nakagawa ",
    "sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath2 ( for a comprehensive overview , see ref .",
    "neutrino oscillations then occur between the different mass eigenstate components of the original flavor eigenstate .",
    "the measurement of neutrino oscillations has led to rather accurate measurements of the differences of squared masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the absolute values of the neutrino masses however , in the generalized standard model remain entirely unknown .",
    "their determination requires additional information .",
    "such independent information can be provided by measuring the `` average specific flavor neutrino mass ''",
    "@xmath3 , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the mass of the mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "determination of the neutrino mass based on the dispersion relation , such as inferring the mass from tof measurement , gives information on @xmath3 . in the following",
    ", the term `` muon neutrino mass '' denotes the mass of the flavor eigenstate @xmath6 .",
    "the origin of neutrino masses is still somewhat mysterious . in the case of the cabibbo ",

    "one transforms neutrino mass eigenstates into flavor eigenstates ( of the weak interaction ) , and one might ask if the former might in fact participate in hitherto unknown interactions ( in addition to gravity ) . in other words",
    ", it would be somewhat strange if the mass eigenstates have no further physical interpretation .",
    "neutrinos are very special fermions .",
    "they are lighter by orders of magnitude as compared to other `` light '' fermions and therefore approach the light cone already at very small kinetic energies .",
    "neutrinos have never been observed at rest , and in view of the smallness of their low - energy cross sections , it may never be possible to observe them at rest even if they have nonzero dirac and/or majorana masses .",
    "furthermore , the numerical value of their masses and moreover , even the sign of their mass squares are not known . in light of these experimental results and observations , it is necessary to recall that the best current limit on the muon neutrino mass @xmath6 stems from the investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which puts @xmath7 at a @xmath8 confidence level .",
    "cosmological observations provide more stringent limits of the order of 1ev for the sum of the masses of the three neutrino species @xmath9 ( see ref .",

    "@xcite , one obtains @xmath10 if one uses the value @xmath11 for the negative pion mass , which is close to the preferred value in the particle data listings @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , our proposed measurement of mass is to be based on measuring the time of flight of muon neutrinos along a short baseline .",
    "the european light infrastructure ( eli ) intends to operate high - intensity beamlines used for proton acceleration , with the intent of answering questions in laser and particle physics , as well as astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "laser acceleration of protons with the purpose of generating pions that decay into muons and muon neutrinos , for injection into a neutrino beamline after passing through a graphite target , is explicitly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , and fundamental particle physics experiments with laser - driven particle injection is a definite option for the eli beamlines which are currently under construction  @xcite .",
    "pions are well known to be produced copiously when a proton beam is incident on a target composed of basically any element",
    ". a graphite target would then be a source of a beam of muon neutrinos .",
    "their energy distribution can be assessed by deflecting the charged particles out of the line immediately after the production target has been hit with the laser pulse , thereby eliminating positional uncertainty regarding the emission of the muon neutrino . after a flight along a short baseline ( of the order of a few kilometers ) , an obvious approach would be to detect muon neutrinos in a liquid scintillator detector .    at high energies , in view of lorentz invariance , all particles in the standard model approach the light - cone dispersion relation between energy @xmath12 and spatial momentum @xmath13 of the particle , @xmath14 .",
    "the mass of a particle therefore is primarily visible in its low - energy properties .",
    "thus in order to assess the particle s mass , one needs detectors with low energy thresholds .",
    "organic liquid scintillators are employed in the borexino neutrino detector which is currently in operation at the laboratorio nazionale del gran sasso ( lngs ) .",
    "it has a low energy threshold of only @xmath15 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and is thus able to detect the @xmath16be solar neutrinos which have an energy of about 0.862mev .    a neutrino time - of - flight measurement could yield a value of the neutrino mass @xmath17 , in view of the relation @xmath18 , provided the detector records the energy of the oncoming neutrino and its time of flight with sufficient precision .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we first provide a mini - review of the status of theoretical aspects of neutrino physics relevant to our studies .",
    "models based on generalized dirac equations include lorentz - violation as a hypothesis .",
    "also neutrino - matter interactions and other alternative models are discussed .",
    "the experimental proposal is described in sec .",
    "[ sec31 ] , while an estimate of the achievable experimental accuracy is given in sec .",
    "[ sec32 ] .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ appa ] , we briefly discuss the status of exotic neutrino models with regard to fundamental symmetries and the causality principle . natural units with @xmath19 are used throughout the article unless stated otherwise .",
    "in the particle physics data summary of the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , it is stated that `` on the basis of the existing neutrino data it is impossible to determine whether the massive neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions '' .",
    "majorana fermions would allow for neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite .",
    "they are equal to their own antiparticles  @xcite and have very special transformation properties under the discrete symmetries .",
    "for instance , they have an internal parity equal to the imaginary unit .",
    "this is because in general , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the parity and @xmath22 is the fermion number ( @xmath23 for majorana fermions ) .",
    "the concept of lepton number becomes void if we assume a majorana nature of the neutrinos .",
    "the global symmetry of the standard model lagrangian under a global phase change @xmath24 for all fermion fields ( which otherwise leads to lepton number conservation ) is lost if we assume that the neutrinos are majorana fermions .",
    "indeed , they are described by the majorana equation which , in four - component notation , is equivalent to the dirac equation , supplemented by the charge - conjugation invariance condition . the majorana equation , on the level of first quantization , does not allow for plane - wave solutions proportional to @xmath25 ,",
    "although rather well - known dirac - majorana confusion theorems  @xcite ensure that one can not reliably distinguish the nature of the neutrino(s ) based on scattering experiments alone .",
    "right - handed neutrinos and left - handed antineutrinos have never been observed in nature .",
    "the seesaw ( type i , ii and  iii ) mechanisms  @xcite explain the lack of observations by the ( very ) large mass of the `` wrong '' helicity states , which would be of the order of the grand unification energy scale .",
    "because of their elusive nature , neutrinos have given rise to exotic speculation regarding the relativistic wave equation governing their quantum dynamics .",
    "indeed , chodos , hauser and kostelecky first proposed  @xcite that the neutrino might be a tachyon , fulfilling a lorentz - invariant dispersion relation while remaining superluminal along its entire trajectory .",
    "partially inspired by the smallness of the additive terms needed to give rise to an apparent infinitesimal superluminality of the neutrino , kostelecky and collaborators went on to study lorentz - violating phases in standard model extensions ( smes ) ( see refs .",
    "lorentz - violating phases would single out a specific direction in space as a `` preferred '' symmetry - breaking seed and lead to anisotropies in the dispersion relation of particles , thus ( potentially ) leading to infinitesimal superluminality in preferred directions .",
    "lorentz symmetry is not gauged ( unless one gauges gravity ) .    while lorentz symmetry is commonly accepted as a basic principle underlying particle physics , nevertheless in the past numerous works raised the the possibility of violation of lorentz invariance @xcite . according to the classic work of coleman and glashow  @xcite one can introduce lorentz invariance violating ( lv ) terms into the lagrangian , parameterized by lv parameters .",
    "lv terms in the lagrangian can arise due to gravitational , dark energy or dark matter interactions  @xcite .    in the work of colladay and kostelecky  @xcite",
    ", the authors consider a modified lagrangian for the dirac particle as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dirac spinor wave function , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are four - vectors .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 is the dirac adjoint spinor .",
    "the dirac equation derived from the lagrangian   reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bispinor dirac wave function .",
    "modified dirac equations of the functional form   do not suppress the `` wrong '' helicity state of the neutrino field but allow for both left - handed as well as right - handed neutrinos ; the additional projections onto the left - handed sector of the fermion fields are described in sec .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "equation   breaks lorentz invariance , but in a very subtle way .",
    "namely , under a lorentz transformation the dirac field transforms as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the bispinor representation of the lorentz group .",
    "we recall the well - known relation @xmath35 this implies that under the combined action of the spinor and vector lorentz transformations , the dirac matrices are shape - invariant .",
    "therefore , upon a change of the lorentz frame , the dirac equation changes to @xmath36 for zero @xmath29 , the dispersion relation fulfilled by the solutions of eq",
    ".   reads as @xmath37 whereas the dispersion relation for eq .",
    "reads as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 denotes the spatial part of the four - vector @xmath40 .",
    "if the @xmath28 and @xmath29 were ordinary lorentz vectors , then lorentz invariance would be fulfilled .",
    "however , it is stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in keeping with their interpretation as effective couplings arising from a scenario with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( of lorentz symmetry ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are invariant under cpt transformations . in the text before eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is also stressed that ( because the currents @xmath42 and @xmath43 change sign under cpt ) , the lorentz - breaking terms are not cpt invariant .",
    "any experiment which investigates lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector constrains the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    a conceivable relevance of eq .   for neutrino physics",
    "can be tested experimentally , and it even allows for a connection to be drawn to the original work ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) in which an exotic variant of the dirac equation was proposed for neutrino physics .",
    "namely , if we study eq .   in a lorentz frame with @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "then the generalized dirac hamiltonian reads as @xmath46 ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 matrices are used in the dirac representation ) . for @xmath49 and negative @xmath50 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath51 , it reads as @xmath52 if an experiment is restricted to a specific energy range and can not scan the dispersion relation , then it is instructive to point out that the tachyonic dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath53 approximates the dispersion relation of the lorentz - violating dirac equation with constant @xmath50 in a specific energy interval ( @xmath54 ) , latexmath:[\\[e = \\sqrt { \\vec p^{\\,2 } - m^2 } \\approx     \\qquad    in this case , one would intuitively assume that spatial anisotropies modeled by other nonvanishing @xmath28 and @xmath29 parameters and measurements over wider energy ranges would allow us to constrain the parameter space and the functional form of the lorentz violation further .",
    "also , one should note that constant shifts on the neutrino energy ( such as the one produced by @xmath56 ) can not be determined by a time - of - flight measurement because the group velocity remains unchanged . in order to produce an observable effect , an additional modification of the dispersion relation due to a weak decay is necessary , as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other recently explored models describe a conceivable environmental effect on neutrino propagation @xcite .",
    "one can write down lagrangians where a background - dependent fifth - force field couples to neutrinos differently as compared to other particles .",
    "the fifth - force interaction might be enhanced in spatial regions with a high matter density .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , one may speculate that the interaction between the new field and the neutrino sector could modify the effective metric seen by the neutrinos which could result in modifications of the `` local '' dispersion relation without violating the lorentz symmetry at a fundamental level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors introduce a new massive spin-2 field in order to formulate their model .",
    "by contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite , oda and taira formulate a model in terms of a spin-1 gauge field sourced in a condensed - matter environment .",
    "it is claimed in recent papers  @xcite that neutrinos from the supernova sn1987a data support the existence of 4.0ev and 21.4ev neutrino mass ( not flavor ! ) eigenstates , and it is shown that such large masses could be made consistent with existing constraints including neutrino oscillation data and upper limits on the neutrino flavor state masses , provided that there also exist a pair of sterile neutrino mass states whose masses are nearly degenerate with the active ones , plus a third active - sterile doublet that is tachyonic ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the most direct confirmation might involve a neutrino oscillation experiment sensitive to @xmath58 .",
    "for example , at a neutrino energy of 1gev one easily finds an oscillation wavelength of about 34 cm , which could be readily observed in a short - baseline experiment , realized with a spatially compact experimental apparatus to be described in the following .    at the end of the current section",
    ", we reemphasize that of course , all of the exotic theoretical model discussed above remain highly controversial ( see also appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "our proposal for the beamline setup is sketched in fig .",
    "protons can either be fed into the beam line from a storage ring , via a kicker magnet ( as shown in the figure ) , or they can be injected into the beam line by laser acceleration  @xcite ( `` injector pulse '' ) .",
    "indeed , the idea of injecting protons into a neutrino experiment by laser acceleration was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . with current technology , it is possible to reach laser intensities of @xmath59 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is more than sufficient to immediately accelerate a `` plasma mirror '' consisting of protons and electrons into the relativistic regime . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , during the laser interaction the radiation momentum is mainly transferred to the protons through the charge separation field ( in the plasma ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the protons therefore is much greater than that of the electrons .",
    "outline of the proposed experiment .",
    "the explanation is in the text . ]",
    "our proposal aims at comparing directly the speeds of neutrinos and photons , in a relatively short baseline , as given in fig .",
    "one may envisage to send photons either together with the neutrinos in the same vacuum pipe , or in a tiny vacuum pipe in the middle of the neutrino `` tunnel '' .",
    "the reference laser pulse is triggered by the proton injector device , with a constant time delay .",
    "the short baseline could also facilitate a neutrino speed measurement performed in vacuum and in baryonic matter simultaneously , in order to test a conceivable matter dependence .    in the ( graphite )",
    "neutrino production target , the protons generate a highly collimated beam of positively charged pions that can decay into positively charged muons ( @xmath60 ) and muon neutrinos ( @xmath61 ) . muons and pions are deflected from the beam line almost immediately behind the pion target , in order to restrict the spatial region along the beam line available for muon neutrino creation . for typical muons and pions produced in p ",
    "n collisions , the relativistic factor is of order unity , and a typical value is @xmath62 .",
    "the masses of muon and pion are @xmath63 and @xmath64mev , and the magnetic field required to deflect these charged particles out of the beam on a distance of @xmath65 cm is given by the cyclotron formula @xmath66 which is of the same order - of - magnitude as currently used for high - performance magnets such as those used at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the finite lifetime of the @xmath67 decay into @xmath68 otherwise leads to an ambiguity in the time of flight of the decay products , which we would like to eliminate as far as possible , by restricting the spatial region in which the pions may decay .",
    "still , in order to eliminate a conceivable admixture from the high - energy tail of laser - accelerated protons ( and high - energy pions / muons ) , the insertion of a muon stopper into the beamline appears useful .",
    "this approach necessitates a high - intensity proton source , which can be realized with a strong laser .",
    "let us assume that , with a pion target of dimension 5 cm along the beam line , muons and pions are allowed to travel another 10 cm before being deflected .",
    "this takes roughly @xmath69s at the speed of light , resulting in a comparable uncertainty of order @xmath70s as to the point where the neutrino creation occurred",
    ".    converted into a time - of - flight measurement , the ensuing uncertainty in the assignment of the time of flight of the neutrino ( as opposed to that of the pion ) leads to an experimental `` line shape '' amenable to a simulation with monte carlo techniques ( geant4 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , given the concrete experimental parameters and details of the apparatus .",
    "an estimate of the experimental beam shape at the detector based on geant4 is included below .",
    "line shapes can typically be analyzed to one part in 100 , so that optimistically , a projected resolution on the order of @xmath71s for the time - of - flight measurement seems within reach .",
    "the lifetime of a pion is on the order of @xmath72s . at a typical relativistic lorentz factor of @xmath73 ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath74mev  pions , we can thus expect that in the spatial region before deflection about half a percent of the created pions will in fact decay into a muon - neutrino , the ratio @xmath75 of the decaying pions ( in the restricted spatial region ) to the overall number of pions being given by @xmath76 with the copious production of pions taken into account , this should not inhibit the possibility of obtaining good statistics in the measurement .",
    "the neutrinos then continue their flight along the beam axis for a distance of the order of 10 km .",
    "we found this length scale as a good compromise in order to make the observation of a sizeable deviation from the speed of light possible with typical currently available detector time resolution , while keeping the construction costs under control and allowing for a reference light pulse to be sent from the graphite target to the detector , eliminating any uncertainties regarding the actual length of the beamline ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in order to make the apparatus operational for higher - energy ( above 50mev ) neutrinos , one has to surround the primary detector with a `` veto '' detector which reveals when a cosmic ray passes into the apparatus , allowing the corresponding activity in the primary detector to be ignored ( `` vetoed '' ) . for low - energy experiments ,",
    "one typically has to locate the detector deep underground so that the earth above could reduce the cosmic ray rate to tolerable levels , indicated by horizontal bars around the detector in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    with a time tagging of the order of a few picoseconds available in typical modern detectors , it should then be possible to derive meaningful information on the neutrino dispersion relation . however , a critical question concerns the basic properties of the neutrino detector suitable for such an experiment .",
    "both charged - current interaction as well as neutral - current interactions are relevant to the detection of muon neutrinos , as given by the following feynman diagrams ( a ) and ( b )        respectively .",
    "above muon threshold , weak charged - current ( cc ) interactions @xmath77 ( where a nucleus in the material undergoes a transition @xmath78 ) , or @xmath79 ( with the electrons in the detector material ) , produce muons which can be detected , e.g. , via their cherenkov light in water ( as in the super - kamiokande detector ) .",
    "for muon neutrinos , the threshold is about 105 mev . for lower muon",
    "neutrino energy , charged - current interactions are not available in order to trigger detection .",
    "neutral - current interactions ( like elastic scattering ) take over at lower energies .    indeed , for low - energy neutrinos , liquid scintillator detectors are much better , because the interaction of a neutrino ( of any flavor ) via neutral - current interactions with the electrons in the scintillator medium ( scattering process @xmath80 ) does not have any threshold at all .",
    "indeed , the miniboone detector @xcite uses pure mineral oil as a detection medium , which is a natural scintillator . in order to illustrate this statement , we recall that the miniboone detector is filled with about 800  tons of mineral oil , and its 1280 photomultipliers provide coverage for about 10% of the tank region .",
    "no reliable information seems to be available on the precise value of the miniboone detector threshold , but data taken for ref .",
    "@xcite ( available on the webpage of the experiment , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) go down to @xmath81 , suggesting that the detector threshold must be around this value or below .",
    "the borexino detector uses 300 tons of organic liquid scintillator pseudocumene ( pc ) containing 1.5 g ppo in each liter of pc , immersed in 1000  tons of pure pc as buffer .",
    "the buffer is surrounded by 2200 photomultipliers .",
    "an external shielding is provided by 2400 tons of pure water .",
    "its threshold  @xcite is at roughly @xmath82 , well below the @xmath83 of the @xmath16be neutrino flux and thus responsive to a very important part of the solar neutrino spectrum ( see table 6.2 of ref .",
    "liquid scintillator detectors typically have a good time and energy resolution , but do not preserve directional information . while they are not as fast as cerenkov detectors , they currently hold the record for the lowest energy threshold among neutrino detectors .",

    "( b ) estimates time distribution of the neutrino tof delay as compared to the tof of light belonging to a 10 km distance .",
    "see the text for further explanation . ]    in order to give some guidance on the detector design , the result of a geant4  monte - carlo simulation with 100 billion protons with energy of @xmath85 and positively charged pions in the energy range of @xmath86gev are presented in fig .",

    "@xcite ) for the measurement of the muon neutrino mass has some potential for future experiments .    still , because of the smallness of the neutrino mass , and without considerable further improvement in neutrino detectors beyond the current state of the art in liquid scintillators , in a first approximation",

    "the role of the dirac adjoint in the tachyonic sector is assumed by the pseudoscalar adjoint  @xmath139 , and the generalized dirac propagator is calculated as the time - ordered product @xmath140 .",
    "one postulates ( anti-)commutator relations for the fundamental field operators which assign negative norm to the `` wrong '' helicity states of the tachyonic field , excluding them from the physical spectrum via a gupta  bleuler condition  @xcite .",
    "in particular , vacuum instability issues , which plague spin - zero tachyonic field theory , do not affect the spin-@xmath141 version , because the ( pseudoscalar ) mass term enters the lagrangian linearly , not quadratically .",
    "let us take back a step and assume that neutrinos are dirac particles and travel slower than light . the elusive helicity reversal of a neutrino overtaken on a highway without speed limits ( in a `` thought experiment '' )",
    "has given rise to a number of pertinent investigations and discussions  @xcite .",
    "the intriguing helicity reversal has been discussed as `` question # 76 '' in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the neutrino is a subluminal dirac particle , then right - handed neutrino interactions are suppressed in the ( ordinary ) dirac theory by a factor @xmath142 where @xmath12 is the energy scale , and one might thus argue that overtaking a dirac neutrino sterilizes it .",
    "however , the `` overtaken and now right - handed neutrinos '' are not completely sterile ; their transition currents are suppressed but not zero ( helicity is not equal to chirality if the mass is nonvanishing ) .",
    "the `` overtaken neutrinos '' are , in particular , less sterile than the `` other '' right - handed neutrinos which otherwise arise from the seesaw mechanism : interactions of the latter ones are suppressed by an additional factor @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the grand unification scale . by contrast , the `` overtaken and now right - handed '' subluminal dirac neutrinos have the same mass as the left - handed ones by virtue of lorentz symmetry conservation during the overtaking maneuvre .",
    "we also recall that an essential ingredient in the construction of the original standard model was that neutrinos are massless ( and transform as a weyl spinor , which allows them to be either left- or right - handed ) .",
    "[ [ why - a - tachyonic - neutrino - has - to - be - light - causality - and - information ] ] why a tachyonic neutrino has to be light : causality and information ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the mysterious neutrino burst under the mont blanc  @xcite , which was recorded roughly 4 hours before the rest of the other neutrinos from the supernova sn1987a still eludes ( some ) scientists . the classical dispersion relation , or , energy - velocity relation , of a superluminal particle reads as follows ( we revert to si units ) , @xmath145 here",
    ", we would like to discuss the question why the exotic tachyonic described by eq .",
    ", if they exist , have to be very light particles , and we also address a certain caveat in the causality violations which could potentially be achieved using the light , superluminal particles : namely , sending a strong conceivably superluminal neutrino burst into a specific direction of space , it is certainly possible to send a message `` that something happened somewhere else '' at superluminal speeds , into distant regions of the universe . however , as we show below , it is very difficult to reliably `` stamp '' any information onto the superluminal neutrinos . colloquially speaking , the dilemma is this : high - energy tachyonic neutrinos approach the light cone and travel only infinitesimally faster than light itself ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "their interaction cross sections may be sufficiently large to allow for good detection efficiency but this is achieved at the cost of sacrificing the speed advantage .",
    "low - energy tachyonic neutrinos may a substantially faster than light [ see eq .  ] but their interaction cross sections are small and the information sent via them may be lost",
    ". even barring arguments which might question the practicablity of heavy tachyonic neutrinos for signaling in principle , it is possible to show that the smallness of the cross sections sets important boundaries for the possibility to transmit information , as follows .    indeed , turning the argument around and postulating that superluminal particles should not have the capacity to transport any `` imprinted '' information into the past , we are naturally led to the assumption that any conceivable superluminal particles have to be very light , and weakly interacting .",
    "we now supplement these considerations with a numerical estimate .",
    "we consider a hypothetical neutrino flavor eigenstate of mass @xmath147 , and assume that the interaction cross section fulfills @xcite @xmath148 with @xmath149fb and @xmath150gev , which is satisfied by known cross sections for charged - current and neutral current tree - level interactions , as tabulated in ref .",
    "the order - of - magnitude relation given in eq .   remains valid for neutrino scattering off electrons , for all three neutrino flavors , even if additional charged - current interactions exist for electron neutrinos , due to exchange graphs with virtual @xmath151 bosons ( for muon and tau neutrinos , only the @xmath152 boson contributes at tree level ) .",
    "( the scale @xmath153 is a characteristic scale for the neutrino energy and has no connection to the neutrino mass @xmath154 . )",
    "a particle typically can not be localized to better than an area equal to the square of its ( reduced ) compton wavelength , @xmath155 the detection probability @xmath21 for a perfectly focused particle therefore does not exceed @xmath156 if we are to send information reliably , then the detection probability should be of order unity . solving the equation @xmath157 for @xmath105",
    ", we obtain @xmath158 where we assume a neutrino mass of 1mev@xmath159 .",
    "when traveling at a speed @xmath160 for a path length @xmath161 , the neutrino acquires a path length difference of @xmath162 , which compares to its compton wavelength as follows , @xmath163 we here use the fact that a path length difference is physically significant if it exceeds the compton wavelength of the traveling particle .",
    "so , in conclusion , the distance that the detectable neutrino ( @xmath157 ) has to travel at the small deviation @xmath105 from the speed of light given by eq .  , before the accumulated path difference exceeds its compton wavelength , is larger than the commonly assumed size of the universe , @xmath164 .",
    "this conclusion becomes much stringent for realistic mass values as the distance @xmath161 in eq .",
    "is proportional to the seventh inverse power of the neutrino mass .",
    "if we want to prevent information being sent into the past , then the neutrino mass muss be below @xmath165 , which is satisfied by realistic tachyonic neutrinos .",
    "finally , we remark that the permissibility of small violations of the `` cosmic speed limit '' ( the speed of light ) and on small length and distance scales has been discussed in the literature previously ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it holds provided quantum effects are properly taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we refer to the experiments in the group of nimtz  @xcite , which also use a compact apparatus and rely on the quantum mechanical tunneling effect , which lies outside the regime of classical mechanics .",
