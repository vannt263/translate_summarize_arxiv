    "in current cosmological theory the mass density of the universe is dominated by dark matter .",
    "the most successful model of structure formation is that based upon the concept of cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in the cdm hypothesis",
    "dark - matter particles interact only via the gravitational force . since the initial distribution of density perturbations in these models has greatest power on small scales , the first objects to collapse and form dark - matter halos are of low mass .",
    "larger objects form through the merging of these smaller sub - units . consequently",
    ", the entire process of structure formation is thought to proceed in a `` bottom - up '' , hierarchical manner .",
    "clearly then , the rate of dark - matter halo mergers is an absolutely crucial ingredient in models of galaxy and large - scale - structure formation , from sub - galactic scales to galactic and galaxy - cluster scales .",
    "the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism @xcite has long provided a simple , intuitive , and surprisingly accurate formula for the distribution of halo masses at a given redshift over a large range of mass scales and for a vast variety of initial power spectra .",
    "an elegant paper by and similar work by and extended the work of press and schechter to determine the rate at which halos of a given mass merge with halos of some other mass .",
    "in addition to providing valuable physical insight , these merger rates have extraordinary practical value , having been applied to galaxy - formation models , e.g. , if galaxy morphologies are determined by the merger history @xcite ; agn activity @xcite ; models for lyman - break galaxies @xcite ; abundances of binary supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) @xcite ; rates for smbh coalescence @xcite and the resulting lisa event rate @xcite ; the first stars @xcite ; galactic - halo substructure @xcite ; halo angular momenta @xcite and concentrations @xcite ; galaxy clustering @xcite ; particle acceleration in clusters @xcite ; and formation - redshift distributions for galaxies and clusters and thus their distributions in size , temperature , luminosity , mass , and velocity @xcite .    however , as first noted by lacey & cole ( 1993 ; see their section  3.1 ) and as we demonstrated in benson , kamionkowski & hassani ( 2005 ; hereafter paper  i ] ) these merger rates are fundamentally flawed .",
    "the extended - press - schechter ( eps ) formulae for merger rates are mathematically self - inconsistent , providing _ two _ different results for the same merger rate , as was also pointed out by , which are increasingly discrepant for larger mass ratios .",
    "this ambiguity will be particularly important for , e.g. , understanding galactic substructure and for smbh - merger rates @xcite .",
    "even the smaller numerical inconsistency for mergers of nearly equal mass may be exponentially enhanced during repeated application of the formula while constructing merger trees to high redshift .",
    "moreover , the ambiguity calls into question the entire formalism , even when the two possibilities seem to give similar answers quantitatively .",
    "recently , have described an alternative derivation of merger rates from eps theory and an implementation which appears to be self - consistent .",
    "our goal here , however , is not to find a merger rate kernel which reproduces the results of eps since that theory does not reproduce results found in n - body simulations .",
    "instead , we aim to find a merger kernel which agrees well with n - body results and correctly evolves mass functions designed to fit the halo mass function measured from n - body simulations .    in paper",
    "i , we discussed the mathematical requirements of a self - consistent theory of halo mergers .",
    "as recognized already @xcite , the merger process is described by the smoluchowski coagulation equation .",
    "indeed , several authors have employed the smoluchowski equation in precisely this way @xcite .",
    "this equation simply says that the rate at which the abundance of halos of a given mass changes is determined by the difference between the rate for creation of such halos by mergers of lower - mass halos and the rate for destruction of such halos by mergers with other halos .",
    "the correct expression for the merger rate must be one that yields the correct rate of evolution of the halo abundance when inserted into the coagulation equation .",
    "the problem is thus to find a merger rate , or `` kernel , '' that is consistent with the evolution of the halo abundance , either the press - schechter abundance or one of its more recent n - body  inspired variants @xcite .",
    "the apparent simplicity of the mathematical problem is in fact quite deceptive .",
    "the smoluchowski coagulation equation is in fact an infinite set of coupled nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the equation appears in a variety of areas of science ",
    ", aerosol physics , phase separation in liquid mixtures , polymerization , star - formation theory @xcite , planetesimals @xcite , chemical engineering , biology , and population genetics ",
    "so there is a vast but untidy literature on the subject ( although see for an illuminating review ) .",
    "it has been studied a little by pure and applied mathematicians @xcite .",
    "still , solutions to the coagulation equation are poorly understood .",
    "furthermore , there is virtually no literature on the problem we face : i.e. , how to find a merger kernel that , when inserted into the coagulation equation , yields the desired halo mass distribution and its evolution as a solution .    in paper",
    "i we solved smoluchowski s equation numerically subject to two additional physically - motivated constraints ( or regularization conditions ) .",
    "first , the merger kernel should be positive for all masses and , second , the merger kernel should be a smooth function of its arguments .",
    "the second regularization condition was imposed by minimizing the second derivatives of the kernel with respect to the two arguments .",
    "this allowed us to find unique solutions to smoluchowski s equation for several power - law power spectra .",
    "these solutions were in reasonable agreement with the limited n - body data available for comparison .",
    "we have attempted to extend the work carried out in paper  i to the physically interesting case of a cdm power spectrum , using a much improved calculation able to span a wider dynamic range of halo masses .",
    "while we have been able to obtain solutions to smoluchowski s equation for such power spectra we find that they _ do not _ correspond to the merger rates that occur in n - body simulations of structure formation , which we consider to provide the `` correct '' solution for our purposes .",
    "specifically , while our solutions are correct solutions of the smoluchowski equation , they do not reproduce the progenitor mass functions of halos as measured from n - body simulations .",
    "( in fact , they typically perform worse than the standard extended press - schechter theory . )",
    "this is , perhaps , not surprising as our results are controlled by the regularization conditions applied .",
    "we required solutions to be smooth , which seems reasonable , but our minimization is forced to pick the _",
    "smoothest _ solution in order to find a unique answer .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the universe uses a smooth merger rate , but not the smoothest .",
    "trials with alternative regularization conditions have failed to find any more successful approach .    until such time as improved physical understanding of the physics governing the merger kernel is uncovered we have adopted a different approach to finding a suitable merger kernel .",
    "recently , several authors have used the millennium simulation to provide constraints on either the merger rate @xcite or the progenitor mass functions of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "in particular , parkinson , cole & helly ( 2008 ; hereafter pch08 ) utilized progenitor mass functions to constrain the parameters of a function used to modify the standard extended press - schechter merger rate function and thereby constructed a merger tree binary split algorithm which accurately matched those progenitor mass functions .",
    "this approach is successful , but is limited by the accuracy and extent of the n - body data . in this paper , we demonstrate how we can use smoluchowski s equation to provide an additional constraint on such algorithms .",
    "this approach is powerful for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the pch08 merger tree algorithm is a binary split algorithm and so should obey smoluchowski s equation ; 2 .   constraining the three free parameters of the pch08 algorithm",
    "is much easier than attempting to numerically invert smoluchowski s equation subject to complicated regularization conditions ; 3 .",
    "smoluchowski s equation applies over all halo masses , while even the millennium simulation has a limited dynamical range of masses that it can probe .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it assumes a particular functional form for the merger kernel ( with free parameters that are to be fit ) .",
    "there is no guarantee that this functional form will permit a solution to smoluchowski s equation for any values of its free parameters and , in fact , we will show that it does not .",
    "nevertheless , we can find the best - fit to the smoluchowski equation .",
    "further free parameters could be introduced as constraints , of course , which should result in improved agreement with smoluchowski s equation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : methods ] we describe the smoluchowski equation as used in this work and , in particular , how it is applied to the construction of merger trees . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of fitting the parameters of the pch08 model to n - body progenitor mass functions and to the smoluchowski equation and examine how these influence the evolution of the dark - matter halo mass function . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we examine the implications of these results .",
    "in this section we will describe the techniques used in this work and the specific implementations used to construct progenitor mass functions and evolving dark - matter halo mass functions .",
    "smoluchowski s equation describes the changing distribution of `` masses '' of objects growing through coagulation . given a distribution , @xmath0 , of object masses @xmath1 at time @xmath2 , the smoluchowski equation gives the rate of change of this distribution : @xmath3 where @xmath4 encodes the merger rate between objects of mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 at time @xmath2 .",
    "it is , therefore , symmetric in its arguments , i.e. @xmath7 . the first term in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : smolm ] ) represents creation events , while the second represents destruction events .",
    "only three forms for @xmath4 are known to permit analytic solutions of smoluchowski s equation : @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is a constant ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in this work ,",
    "the objects we consider are dark matter halos , and the mass is the total mass of those halos .",
    "the second analytic solution is of particular interest as it corresponds to the solution for dark matter halos in a universe with a @xmath12 power spectrum when @xmath13 .",
    "the other two analytic solutions are not cosmologically interesting .",
    "it is convenient to work with scaled variables for mass and time .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the natural time variable is @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 is the extrapolated linear theory overdensity required for halo collapse in the spherical top - hat collapse model ( as appears in the press - schechter expression for the halo mass function ) .",
    "we also choose to express masses in units of the characterstic mass scale @xmath16 ( defined such that @xmath17)=\\delta_{\\rm c}(t)\\equiv \\exp(-\\tau)$ ] where @xmath18 is the fractional mass variance of the linear density field extrapolated to @xmath19 ( we use @xmath20 to indicate redshift so as to distinguish from the mass variable @xmath21 ) .",
    "with these choices , the smoluchowski equation becomes : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the distribution of halo masses , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the merger rate function in these new variables . for the specific case of power - law power - spectra ( which are , of course , scale - free ) there is no explicit time - dependence with this choice of units and we can write @xmath27 thus , a single solution , valid at all times can be found for power - law power - spectra . for cdm power - spectra , which are not scale free , the merger kernel can in principle depend explicitly on time ( although the choice of scaled variables will minimize this dependence ) . in principle , therefore , we could use smoluchowski s equation at each point in time ( @xmath28 ) to provide constraints on the merger rate function .",
    "we retain the variable choices @xmath21 and @xmath28 as we expect the solutions @xmath26 to be only slowly changing with @xmath28 in these variables , since the cdm power - spectrum is close to power - law over a wide range of masses . in practice",
    ", we will use only the @xmath29 ( i.e. present day ) smoluchowski equation , although our methods could be easily applied to other redshifts if required .",
    "it is well known that the press - schechter mass function is not a good description of the mass functions found in n - body simulations of cdm structure formation @xcite .",
    "our methods are applicable to any mass function @xmath24 and so we can replace the press - schechter mass function with a fitting formula such as that from : @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times   ( 1 + 1/x^{\\prime 2q_{\\rm smt } } ) , \\label{eqn : zsmtabundance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is chosen such that the mass density in halos equals the mean density of the universe .",
    "smoluchowski s equation involves the time derivative of this function , which is given by @xmath36 .",
    "\\label{eq : ysmt}\\ ] ]    as shown in paper  i , the standard extended press - schechter theory predicts a merger kernel @xmath37 , \\label{eq : qeps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have adopted the notation @xmath38 , etc .",
    "this is , of course , asymmetric in the two mass arguments . in scaled variables ,",
    "this becomes @xmath39 , \\label{eq : qepssc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as shown in paper  i , the mean cosmic density , @xmath40 , is removed through an appropriate choice of units .",
    "when computing the mass variance , @xmath41 , we use the same power spectrum as used to generate the initial conditions for the millennium simulation since we will fit to conditional mass functions measured from that simulation .",
    "this power spectrum is integrated under a spherical top - hat real - space window function to obtain @xmath41 .",
    "a primary goal of this study is to provide accurate merger rates for use in the construction of dark matter halo merger trees .",
    "`` accurate '' here is defined to mean that the merger trees so constructed should produce the correct distribution of progenitor halo masses at earlier times and , consequently , produce the correct evolution of the halo mass function .",
    "ideally , this evolution should remain precise even when trees are constructed over large fractions of cosmic history .",
    "the need for such accurate trees is highlighted by the work of ( see their fig .",
    "9 ) , who were forced to restart their calculations of reionization at periodic intervals in redshift due to accumulating inaccuracies in their merger trees .",
    "constructing merger trees also provides a means of comparing our results for the merger rate with measurements from n - body simulations . in this section , therefore , we will describe how we construct merger trees .",
    "we adopt the algorithm described by and pch08 to construct merger trees .",
    "this algorithm considers binary splits of the merger tree with a correction for accretion of mass in halos below the mass resolution of the tree and uses adaptive timesteps to ensure that the probability of non - binary mergers remains small . as note",
    ", their algorithm performs well due to the subtle choice of drawing a progenitor mass from the lower half of the eps progenitor mass distribution function ( i.e. for a parent halo of mass @xmath42 they use only the @xmath43 region of the progenitor mass function when computing the probability of a binary split ) .",
    "it is interesting to realize that this choice effectively symmetrizes the smoluchowski merger kernel as @xmath44 other algorithms have been proposed for constructing merger trees @xcite  we select the because it allows only binary mergers and is therefore consistent with a treatment via the smoluchowski equation .",
    "we refer the reader to and pch08 ( their appendix  a ) for a full description of the merger tree construction algorithm , but address the aspects of the implementation unique to the present work below .",
    "compute two quantities , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which give the fraction of mass gained through accretion and the probability of a binary split respectively for a halo of mass @xmath21 at time @xmath28 and during some time period @xmath47 . in terms of quantities used in this work ,",
    "the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by : @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the mass resolution of the merger tree .",
    "we have expressed this rate in terms of the merger kernel in smoluchowski s equation . pch08 give expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 in terms of the eps expression for the mean number of progenitors of mass @xmath5 expected in a small timestep .",
    "the two ways of expressing these functions are equivalent  we use the version depending on the merger kernel to make clear the connection to smoluchowski s equation as used in this work .",
    "we adaptively choose timesteps @xmath47 to ensure that @xmath55 and @xmath56 , to keep the possibility of multiple fragmentation small and to ensure that the halo mass can change by only a small amount due to accretion in any given timestep .    using the press - schechter mass function for @xmath57 and the eps merger rate @xmath58 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : qepssc ] ) recovers the expressions given by for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : p ] ) are more general however , allowing any mass function @xmath57 and merger rate function @xmath26 to be used .",
    "in particular , pch08 , propose that @xmath59 be modified by multiplying by a function @xmath60^{\\gamma_1 } [ \\delta_{\\rm c}(\\tau)/\\sigma_{\\rm f}]^{\\gamma_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are free parameters . in terms of the smoluchowski equation we can similarly multiply the eps merger kernel by the same function @xmath64 .",
    "we will call this modified merger kernel @xmath65 and label such kernels as @xmath66 .",
    "however , we must also account for the fact that the pch08 algorithm implicitly utilize the press - schechter mass function , while we actually want to reproduce the evolution of the mass function and must therefore use that when solving smoluchowski s equation .",
    "appendix  [ app : ps2st ] describes how to correctly implement the smoluchowski kernel in this case .      utilizing the above algorithm we can , given a halo of mass @xmath67 at the present day ,",
    "construct a merger tree back to some earlier time . by constructing a large number of such trees and averaging over their progenitors",
    "we can construct an estimate of the progenitor mass function at that earlier time .",
    "specifically , we wish to construct progenitor mass function to compare to those determined by from the millennium simulation . estimated progenitor mass functions of @xmath19 halos by locating all @xmath19 halos with a mass within a factor @xmath68 of some mass @xmath69 and then finding all progenitors of those halos at redshifts @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . to compare to these n - body datacole / merger_trees / ms_data/. ]",
    "we first produce a sample of halo masses @xmath1 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 drawn from the mass function .",
    "we then construct a merger tree for each such halo back to @xmath76 and cumulate the progenitor halo masses to estimate a mean conditional mass function .",
    "we construct enough trees that our comparison is limited by noise in the n - body results and not by the limited number of trees constructed .",
    "we then determine a @xmath77 statistic using @xmath78 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the conditional mass function of halos of mass @xmath5 which are progenitors of a halo of mass @xmath69 at @xmath19 , and superscripts refer to the millennium simulation ( ms ) and monte - carlo ( mc ) merger trees constructed using our algorithm .",
    "the values of @xmath80 used are determined from the number of progenitor halos in the millennium simulation assuming poisson statistics .",
    "this process is repeated for different values of the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .      in order to study the evolution of the halo mass function , @xmath81",
    ", we begin by drawing a sample of dark matter halo masses at random from that mass function at some initial time @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "we use a quasi - random method ( specifically a sobol sequence ; section  7.7 ) to produce a non - uniform sample of masses while minimizing fluctuations in the mass function due to random sampling .",
    "we impose a minimum and maximum number of halos to simulate from each decade of halo mass to ensure good sampling of the entire mass range of interest , and span a large enough range of initial masses to ensure that our results are unaffected by the necessarily limited range of masses probed .",
    "we then apply the method to evolve these halos backwards in time until a time @xmath83 is reached .",
    "summing the progenitor halo masses of all of the @xmath82 halos allows us to construct the halo mass function at @xmath83 .",
    "this is then compared to the expected mass function @xmath84 .",
    "given a merger kernel , @xmath65 , we can , for any combination of parameters @xmath66 , evaluate the creation and destruction integrals in smoluchowski s equation and thereby determine @xmath85 for that merger kernel .",
    "in general , a merger kernel will not provide a precise solution to smoluchowski s equation .",
    "we can measure the ability of any given merger kernel to solve smoluchowski s equation by evaluating the mean absolute difference between the resulting @xmath85 and that found by direct differentiation of the mass function with respect to time ( which is , of course , the required solution to give the correct evolution of the mass function ) .",
    "therefore , we compute @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the rate of change of the mass function , and we average the absolute error over @xmath88 different masses , @xmath89 , equally spaced in @xmath90 between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we have chosen to weight by @xmath93 so that we are comparing the rate of change of the mass function per halo .",
    "the choice of how to judge any merger kernel s degree of success in solving smoluchowski s equation is somewhat subjective  the above choice ensures that we require the solution to be most accurate where the timescale for change in the mass function is most rapid ( i.e. for the most massive halos ) .",
    "we find best - fit parameters of @xmath94 and @xmath95 for fits to the millennium simulation conditional mass functions and smoluchowski s equation respectively .",
    "our best - fit parameters for matching conditional mass functions differ slightly from those obtained by pch08 due to our choice to weight our goodness - of - fit measure by the inverse poisson errors on the n - body conditional mass functions .",
    "as expected , both constraints favour @xmath96 ( which reduces the overall merger rate ) and @xmath97 ( which boosts the ratio of low mass to high mass progenitors)pch08 discuss the reasons for these expectations .",
    "figure  [ fig : constraints ] shows constraints in the @xmath98 plane ( i.e. on slices of fixed @xmath63 in the 3-d parameter space ) , for both fitting to conditional mass functions ( blue contours ) and smoluchowski s equation ( red contours ) . in the left and right - hand panels",
    "we show results corresponding to the best - fitting values of @xmath63 for conditional mass functions and smoluchowski s equation respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have described how smoluchowski s equation , which governs any mass - conserving binary coagulation process , may be used to provide constraints on halo merger rates .",
    "these constraints are complementary to those obtained by fitting to conditional mass functions from n - body simulations since they span a wide dynamical range of halo masses . using these methods , and the modified extended press - schechter algorithm described by pch08",
    ", we have identified merger kernels which best - fit conditional mass functions from the millennium simulation and which best solve smoluchowski s equation .",
    "while the functional form of the pch08 merger rate does not permit an exact solution of smoluchowski s equation , we are able to find solutions which greatly improve the accuracy of merger trees . using these best - fit solutions we are able to evolve the dark matter halo mass function from @xmath19 to @xmath99 with remarkably high accuracy , particularly for the most massive objects .",
    "ideally , we would identify a functional form for the merger kernel which permits a precise solution to smoluchowski s equation , while simultaneously producing progenitor masses functions consistent with the available n - body data .",
    "in fact , a perfect solution should agree with n - body data when compared using any statistic ( e.g. distributions of most massive or second most massive progenitors ) .",
    "in reality , we do not know of such a function and , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , only a handful of analytic solutions to smoluchowski s equation are known . in that case , the search for the `` best '' kernel requires making some decision about what are the most important statistics to fit and accepting that some degree of compromise in matching them is unavoidable .",
    "we believe that the most important statistics to match are the evolution of the overall mass function ( which is extremely well constrained from n - body simulations ) and progenitor mass functions . when considering the process of structure and galaxy formation it is these statistics which control , to first order , the number of galaxies able to form at a given point in cosmic history and how those galaxies were formed .",
    "practically , these modified merger rates should prove extremely useful in constructing high - accuracy merger trees for use in studies of structure formation , reionization and galaxy formation .",
    "if even greater accuracy is required , a different functional form for the merger kernel must be adopted ",
    "adding higher - order terms would be straightforward . ] and the techniques described in this work applied to constrain its parameters . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] only a handful of analytic solutions to smoluchowski s equation are known , none of which provide useful solutions for dark matter halo merger rates in cold dark matter universes .",
    "nevertheless , a sufficiently general parametrization of the merger kernel should permit arbitrarily accurate solutions to smoluchowski s equation .",
    "if used in a binary split merger tree algorithm such a kernel should allow for an arbitrarily accurate evolution of the halo mass function ( limited only by the accuracy of the merger tree construction algorithm ) .",
    "this work does not provide any further physical insight into dark matter halo merger rates  at least not directly .",
    "one might hope that physical insight into the `` micro - physics '' ( to make an analogy with other areas in which smoluchowski s equation is applied , e.g. polymer growth ) of dark matter halo merging might point towards a functional form for the kernel . until such insight is gained , the methods described herein provide a practical method for rapid construction of high - accuracy merger trees .",

    "smoluchowski s equation is normally employed to take an existing distribution of masses and evolve it forwards in time subject to a specified merger kernel . both creation and destruction of halos",

    "<S> we place additional constraints on the three parameters of the dark matter halo merger rate function recently proposed by parkinson , cole & helly by utilizing smoluchowski s coagulation equation , which must be obeyed by any binary merging process which conserves mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the constraints from smoluchowski s equation are degenerate , limiting to a thin plane in the three dimensional parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint is consistent with those obtained from fitting to n - body measures of progenitor mass functions , and provides a better match to the evolution of the overall dark matter halo mass function , particularly for the most massive halos . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the proposed merger rate function does not permit an exact solution of smoluchowski s equation and , therefore , the choice of parameters must reflect a compromise between fitting various parts of the mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the techniques described herein are applicable to more general merger rate functions , which may permit a more accurate solution of smoluchowski s equation . </S>",
    "<S> the current merger rate solutions are most probably sufficiently accurate for the vast majority of applications .    </S>",
