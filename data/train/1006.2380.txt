    "interference between wireless links has been taken into account as a critical problem in communication systems .",
    "especially , there exist three categories of the conventional interference management in multi - user wireless networks : decoding and cancellation , avoidance ( i.e. , orthogonalization ) , and averaging ( or spreading ) . to consider both intra - cell and inter - cell interferences of wireless cellular networks , a simple infinite cellular multiple - access channel ( mac ) model , referred to as the wyner s model ,",
    "was characterized and then its achievable throughput performance was analyzed in  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "joint processing strategy among multi - cells was developed in a wyner - like cellular model in order to efficiently manage the inter - cell interferences  @xcite . such cooperation among cells",
    "can be taken into account as another important interference management scheme . even if the work in  @xcite leads to remarkable insight into complex and analytically intractable practical cellular environments , the model under consideration",
    "is hardly realistic .",
    "recently , as an alternative approach to show shannon - theoretic limits , interference alignment  ( ia ) was proposed by fundamentally solving the interference problem when there are two communication pairs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the ia scheme can achieve the optimal degrees - of - freedom  ( dofs ) , which are equal to @xmath9 , in the @xmath0-user interference channel with time - varying channel coefficients .",
    "the basic idea of the scheme is to confine all the undesired interference from other communication links into a pre - defined subspace , whose dimension approaches that of the desired signal space . hence , it is possible for all users to achieve one half of the dofs that we could achieve in the absence of interference",
    "since then , interference management schemes based on ia have been further developed and analyzed in various wireless network environments : multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference network  @xcite , x network  @xcite , and cellular network  @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional ia schemes  @xcite require global channel state information ( csi ) including the csi of other communication links .",
    "furthermore , a huge number of dimensions based on time / frequency expansion are needed to achieve the optimal dofs  @xcite .",
    "these constraints need to be relaxed in order to apply ia to more practical systems . in  @xcite",
    ", a distributed ia scheme was constructed for the mimo interference channel with time - invariant coefficients .",
    "it requires only local csi at each node that can be acquired from all received channel links via pilot signaling , and thus is more feasible to implement than the original one  @xcite .",
    "however , a great number of iterations should be performed until designed transmit / receive beamforming ( bf ) vectors converge prior to data transmission .",
    "now we would like to consider practical wireless uplink networks with @xmath0-cells , each of which has @xmath4 users .",
    "ia for @xmath0-cell uplink networks was first proposed in  @xcite , where the interference from other cells is aligned into a multi - dimensional subspace instead of one dimension .",
    "this scheme also has practical challenges including a dimension expansion to achieve the optimal dofs .    in the literature , there are some results on the usefulness of fading in single - cell downlink broadcast channels , where one can obtain a multi - user diversity ( mud ) gain as the number of mobile users is sufficiently large : opportunistic scheduling  @xcite , opportunistic bf  @xcite , and random bf  @xcite .",
    "more efficient opportunistic interference management strategy  @xcite , which requires less feedback overhead than that in  @xcite , has been developed in broadcast channels , where similarly as in our study , the minimum number of users needed for achieving target dofs has been analyzed .",
    "scenarios exploiting the mud gain have also been studied in cooperative networks by applying an opportunistic two - hop relaying protocol  @xcite and an opportunistic routing  @xcite , and in cognitive radio networks with opportunistic scheduling  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent results  @xcite have shown how to utilize the opportunistic gain when we have a large number of channel realizations .",
    "more specifically , to amplify signals and cancel interference , the idea of opportunistically pairing complementary channel instances has been studied in interference networks  @xcite and multi - hop relay networks  @xcite . in cognitive radio environments",
    "@xcite , opportunistic spectrum sharing was introduced by allowing the secondary users to share the radio spectrum originally allocated to the primary users via transmit adaptation in space , time , or frequency .    in this paper , we introduce an _ opportunistic interference mitigation ( oim ) _ protocol for wireless multi - cell uplink networks .",
    "the scheme adopts the notion of mud gain for performing interference management .",
    "the opportunistic user scheduling strategy is presented in @xmath0-cell uplink environments with time - invariant channel coefficients and base stations ( bss ) having @xmath1 receive antennas . in the proposed oim scheme , each bs opportunistically selects a set of users who generate the minimum interference to the other bss , while in the conventional opportunistic algorithms  @xcite , users with the maximum signal strength at the desired bs are selected for data transmission .",
    "specifically , two oim protocols are proposed according to the number @xmath2 of simultaneously transmitting users per cell : opportunistic interference nulling  ( oin ) and opportunistic interference alignment  ( oia ) protocols . for the oia scheme ,",
    "each bs broadcasts its pre - defined interference direction , e.g. , a set of orthonormal random vectors , to all the users in other cells , whereas for the oin scheme , no broadcast is needed at each bs .",
    "each user computes the amount of its generating interference , affecting the other bss , and feeds back it to its home cell bs .    their performance",
    "is then analyzed in terms of achievable dofs ( also known as capacity pre - log factor or multiplexing gain ) .",
    "it is shown that @xmath3 dofs are achievable under the oin protocol with @xmath1 selected users per cell , while the oia scheme with @xmath2 selected users , whose number is smaller than @xmath1 , achieves @xmath7 dofs . as our main result , we analyze the scaling condition between the number @xmath4 of per - cell users the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) under which our achievability result holds in @xmath0-cell networks , each of which has @xmath4 users .",
    "more specifically , we show that the aforementioned dofs are achieved asymptotically , provided that @xmath4 scales faster than @xmath5 and @xmath8 for the oin and oia protocols , respectively . from the result",
    ", it is seen that there exists a fundamental trade - off between the achievable dofs and the minimum required number @xmath4 of users per cell , based on the two proposed schemes .",
    "in addition , we derive an upper bound on the dofs in @xmath0-cell uplink networks .",
    "it is shown that the upper bound always approaches @xmath3 regardless of @xmath4 and thus the oin scheme achieves the optimal dofs asymptotically with the help of the opportunism .",
    "some important aspects are discussed as follows . to validate the oia scheme ,",
    "computer simulations are performed  the amount of interference leakage is evaluated as in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the conventional opportunistic mechanism exploiting the mud gain in the literature  @xcite inspires us to introduce a two - step scheduling strategy with a slight modification .",
    "we show that a logarithmic gain can further be obtained , similarly as in  @xcite , while the full dofs are maintained .",
    "extension to multi - carrier systems of our achievability result is also taken into account .",
    "finally , the proposed scheme is also compared with the existing methods which can also asymptotically achieve the optimal dofs in cellular uplink networks .    as in  @xcite",
    ", the oim protocol basically operates with local csi and no time / frequency expansion , thereby resulting in easier implementation .",
    "no iteration is also needed prior to data transmission .",
    "the scheme thus operates as a decentralized manner which does not involve joint processing among all communication links .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : system_model ] , we introduce the system and channel models . in section",
    "[ sect : proposed ] , the oim technique is proposed for cellular networks and its achievability in terms of dofs is also analyzed .",

    "numerical evaluation , the two - step scheduling method , extension to multi - carrier scenarios , and comparison with the existing methods are shown in section  [ sect : numerical_ex ] . finally , we summarize the paper with some concluding remark in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .    throughout this paper ,",

    "consider the interfering mac ( imac ) model in  @xcite , which is one of multi - cell uplink scenarios , to describe practical cellular networks . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , there are multiple cells , each of which has multiple mobile users .",
    "the example for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] . under the model ,",
    "each bs is interested only in traffic demands of users in the corresponding cell .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath0 cells and there are @xmath4 users in a cell .",
    "we assume that each user is equipped with a single transmit antenna and each cell is covered by one bs with @xmath1 receive antennas .",
    "the channel in a single - cell can then be regarded as the single - input multiple - output  ( simo ) mac . if @xmath4 is much greater than @xmath1 , then it is possible to exploit the channel randomness and thus to obtain the opportunistic gain in multi - user environments .",
    "the term @xmath24 denotes the channel vector between user @xmath25 in the @xmath26-th cell and bs @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the channel is assumed to be rayleigh , whose elements have zero - mean and unit variance , and to be independent across different @xmath27 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we assume a block - fading model , i.e. , the channel vectors are constant during one block ( e.g. , frame ) and changes to a new independent value for every block . the receive signal vector @xmath30 at bs @xmath27 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transmit symbol of user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell and @xmath2 represents the number of users transmitting data simultaneously in each cell for @xmath33 .",
    "the received signal @xmath34 at bs @xmath27 is corrupted by the independently identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) and circularly symmetric complex additive white gaussian noise  ( awgn ) vector @xmath35 whose elements have zero - mean and variance @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that each user has an average transmit power constraint @xmath37 \\leq p$ ] .",
    "then , the received snr at each bs is expressed as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath36 , which depends on the decoding process at the receiver side . in this work ,",
    "we take into account a simple zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver based on the channel vectors between the bs and its selected home cell users , which will be discussed in detail in section  [ sect : oim ] .",
    "we propose the following two oim protocols : oin and oia protocols .",
    "then , their performance is analyzed in terms of achievable dofs .",
    "we mainly focus on the case for @xmath39 , since otherwise we can simply achieve the maximum dofs by applying the conventional zf receiver ( at bs @xmath40 ) based on the following channel transfer matrix @xmath41      we first introduce an oin protocol with which @xmath1 selected users in a cell transmit their data simultaneously , i.e. , the case where @xmath42 .",
    "it is possible for user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell to obtain all the cross - channel vectors @xmath43 by utilizing a pilot signaling sent from other cell bss , where @xmath28 , @xmath40 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we now examine how much the cross - channels of selected users are in deep fade by computing the following value @xmath45 : @xmath46 which is called _ leakage of interference ( lif ) _ , for @xmath44 . for user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell , the user scheduling metric @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 for @xmath44 . after computing the metric representing the total sum of @xmath49 lif values in ( [ eq.leakage_of_ia_sum ] ) , each user feeds back the value to its home cell bs @xmath27 .",
    "thereafter , bs @xmath27 selects a set @xmath50 of @xmath1 users who feed back the values up to the @xmath1-th smallest one in ( [ eq.leakage_of_ia_sum ] ) , where @xmath51 denotes the index of users in cell @xmath27 whose value is the @xmath25-th smallest one .",
    "the selected @xmath1 users in each cell start to transmit their data packets .    at the receiver side , each bs performs a simple zf filtering based on intra - cell channel vectors to detect the signal from its home cell users , which is sufficient to capture the full dofs in our model . the resulting signal ( symbol ) , postprocessed by zf matrix @xmath52 at bs @xmath27 ,",
    "is then given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the zf column vector .",
    "the fact that the oin scheme needs a great number of per - cell users motivates the introduction of an oia protocol in which @xmath2 transmitting users are selected in each cell for @xmath57 .",
    "the oia scheme is now described as follows .",
    "first , bs @xmath27 in the @xmath27-th cell generates a set of orthonormal random vectors @xmath58 for all @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 corresponds to its pre - defined interference direction , and then broadcasts the random vectors to all the users in other cells .",
    "that is , the interference subspace is broadcasted .",
    "if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 for @xmath64 . otherwise , it follows that @xmath65 .",
    "for example , if @xmath66 is set to 1 , i.e. , single interference dimension is used , then @xmath67 users in a cell are selected to transmit their data packets simultaneously .",
    "this can be easily extended to the case where a multi - dimensional subspace is allowed for ia ( e.g. , @xmath68 ) .    with this scheme",
    ", it is important to see how closely the channels of selected users are aligned with the _ span _ of broadcasted interference vectors . to be specific ,",
    "let @xmath69 denote an orthonormal basis for the null space @xmath70 ( i.e. , kernel ) of the interference subspace .",
    "user @xmath28 in the @xmath27-th cell then computes the orthogonal projection onto @xmath71 of its channel vector @xmath43 , which is given by @xmath72 and",
    "the value @xmath73 which can be interpreted as the lif in the oia scheme , for @xmath44 . for example , if the lif of a user is given by @xmath74 for a certain another bs @xmath44 , then it indicates that the user s channel vectors are perfectly aligned to the interference direction of bs @xmath26 and the user s signal does not interfere with signal detection at the bs . for user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell , the user scheduling metric @xmath75 is finally given by ( [ eq.leakage_of_ia_sum ] ) , as in the oin protocol .",
    "the remaining scheduling steps are the same as those of oin except that a set @xmath76 of @xmath2 users is selected at bs @xmath27 instead of @xmath1 users .",
    "a zf filtering at bs @xmath27 is performed based on both random vectors @xmath77 and the intra - cell channel vectors @xmath78 .",
    "then , the resulting signal , postprocessed by zf matrix @xmath79 , is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath55 ( @xmath82 ) is the zf column vector .",
    "in this subsection , we show that the oim scheme with @xmath2 simultaneously transmitting users per cell achieves the total number @xmath7 of dofs asymptotically .",
    "the achievability is conditioned by the scaling behavior between the number @xmath4 of per - cell users and the received snr .",
    "the total number @xmath83 of dofs is defined as  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the dofs and the rate , respectively , for the transmission of user @xmath28 in the @xmath27-th cell ( @xmath60 ) . ) . ]",

    ", the inequality holds due to the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "now our focus is to characterize the lif @xmath91 in order to quantify the achievable total dofs @xmath83 .",
    "since the @xmath1-dimensional simo channel vector @xmath92 is isotropically distributed , the user scheduling metric @xmath93 , representing the total sum of @xmath49 lif values , follows the chi - square distribution with @xmath94 degrees of freedom for any @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath97 of the metric @xmath93 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the gamma function and @xmath100 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",

    "the number @xmath83 of dofs is lower - bounded by @xmath119 which holds since @xmath7 dofs are achieved for a fraction @xmath120 of the time , from the fact that @xmath121 with probability @xmath120 , where @xmath122    we now examine the scaling condition such that @xmath120 converges to one whp . for a constant @xmath118 , we have @xmath123 where the last equality holds from the fact that if @xmath124 , then @xmath125 and @xmath126 are given by a function of different random vectors , and thus are independent of each other . then , ( [ eq : lowerbound ] ) can further be lower - bounded by using @xmath127 where the inequality holds due to lemma [ lem : gammafunc ] .",
    "if @xmath128 , then the value @xmath129 converges to zero for all @xmath130 , because in ( [ eq.twoterms ] ) , the second term decays exponentially with increasing snr while the first term increases rather polynomially .",
    "the lower bound in ( [ eq : lowerbound ] ) thus converges to one .    as a consequence",
    ", our result indicates that the term @xmath131 scales as @xmath132 whp if @xmath107 .",
    "this further implies that for the decoded symbol @xmath133 , the value in ( [ eq : inr ] ) is smaller than or equal to @xmath134 with probability @xmath120 , approaching one , as the received snr tends to infinity , where @xmath40 and @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath136 if @xmath137 , which completes the proof of this theorem .    from the above theorem ,",
    "let us show the following interesting discussion according to the two proposed protocols .",
    "it is seen that the asymptotically achievable dofs are given by @xmath3 and @xmath7 ( @xmath57 ) when the oin and oia protocols are used in @xmath0-cell uplink networks , respectively .",
    "in fact , the oin scheme achieves the optimal dofs , which will be proved in section  [ sect : upperbound_dof ] by showing an upper bound on the dofs , while it works under the condition that the required number @xmath4 of users per cell scales faster than @xmath138 . on the other hand , the oia scheme operates with at least @xmath139 users per cell , which are surely smaller than those of the oin scheme , at the expense of some dof loss .",
    "this thus gives us a trade - off between the achievable number of dofs and the required number @xmath4 of users in a cell .",
    "note that for the case where @xmath4 is not sufficiently large to utilize the oin scheme , the oia scheme can instead be applied in the networks .",
    "it is now examined how our scheme is fundamentally different from the existing dof - optimal schemes  @xcite .    as addressed",
    "before , the minimum number @xmath4 of per - cell users needs to be guaranteed in order that the proposed oim protocols work properly even in the time - invariant channel condition without any dimension expansion . on the other hand , in  @xcite , a huge number of dimensions are required to asymptotically achieve the optimal dofs .",
    "in this section , to verify the optimality of the proposed oin scheme , we derive an upper bound on the dofs in cellular networks , especially for the imac model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath140 users ( i.e. , @xmath4 streams ) per cell transmit their packets simultaneously to the corresponding bs , where @xmath141 .",
    "is different from @xmath2 in section  [ sect : system_model ] since @xmath140 can be greater than @xmath1 in general . ]",
    "this is a generalized version of the transmission since it is not characterized how many users in a cell need to transmit their packets simultaneously to obtain the optimal dofs .",
    "an upper bound on the total dofs for the imac model is given in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : upper ] for the imac model shown in section  [ sect : system_model ] , the total number @xmath83 of dofs is upper - bounded by @xmath142 where @xmath85 denotes the dofs for the transmission of user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell for @xmath60 and @xmath143 .    the proof of this theorem is presented in appendix  [ pf : upper ] . note that this upper bound is generally derived regardless of whether the number @xmath4 of users per cell tends to infinity or not .",
    "thus , our converse result always holds for arbitrary @xmath4 , whereas the scaling condition @xmath144 is included in the achievability proof .",
    "now let us turn to examining how the upper bound is close to the achievable dofs shown in section  [ sect : proposed ] .    from theorems  [ thm : dof_lower ] and",
    "[ thm : upper ] , when the oin scheme is used ( i.e. , the case of @xmath42 ) , it is shown that the upper bound on the dofs matches the achievable dofs as long as @xmath4 scales faster than @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the proposed oin scheme is optimal in terms on dofs .",
    "in addition , a simple upper bound can also be derived in the following argument .    from a genie - aided removal of all the inter - cell interferences ,",
    "we obtain @xmath0 parallel simo mac systems .",
    "the number of total dofs is thus upper - bounded by @xmath3 due to the fact that the number of dofs for the simo mac is given by @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the upper bound in ( [ eq : upper ] ) approaches @xmath3 as the number @xmath4 of users per cell tends to infinity .",

    "this performance measure enables us to measure the quality of the proposed oia scheme , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "we now evaluate the interference leakage for various system parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : leakage_k_2 ] , the case with @xmath146 , @xmath21 , and @xmath39 is considered , where @xmath2 denotes the number of simultaneously transmitting users per cell . it is shown that when the parameter @xmath2 varies from 7 to 5 , the interference leakage decreases due to less interferers , which is rather obvious .",
    "the result , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : leakage_k_2 ] , indicates that the interference leakage tends to decrease linearly with @xmath4 , while the slopes of the curves are almost identical to each other as @xmath4 increases .",
    "it is further seen how many users per cell are required to guarantee that the interference leakage is less than an arbitrarily small @xmath118 for given parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",

    "users are opportunistically selected in the sense of confining the generating interference power to other cell bss within a constant independent of snr , while the other opportunistic algorithms aim to obtain the mud gain by selecting users with the maximum channel gain .",

    "for the oin and oia protocols under the multi - carrier model , the user scheduling strategy and its achievability result almost follow the same steps as those shown in section  [ sect : proposed ] .",
    "hence , we mainly focus on the scenario where a beamforming can also be performed at the transmitter side along with the user scheduling .    for example , when the oia scheme is utilized , it is possible for each user to reduce the amount of interference caused to the bss in other cells by generating a beamforming matrix and then adjusting its vector directions , while no beamforming is available in section  [ sect : proposed ] since a single transmit antenna is used at each user .",
    "the optimal diagonal weight matrix @xmath163 can be designed at each user in the sense of minimizing the total sum of @xmath49 lif values defined in ( [ eq.leakage_of_ia ] ) , i.e. , the metric @xmath47 : @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the null space of the interference subspace in the @xmath166-th cell .",
    "note that each user does not need to feed back its optimal weight matrix in ( [ eq : opt_weight_matrix ] ) to its home cell bs .",
    "let @xmath167 denote the optimal solution of ( [ eq : opt_weight_matrix ] ) .",
    "the @xmath25-th user in the @xmath27-th cell then feeds back the following scheduling metric @xmath168 that can be computed again by applying the optimal weight matrix : @xmath169 where @xmath170 thereafter , bs @xmath27 selects a set of @xmath2 users who feed back the values up to the @xmath2-th smallest one in ( [ eq : novel_lia ] ) among all users in a cell , where @xmath171 .",
    "this per - user optimization procedure may yield less amount of the lif at each bs than that of the conventional approach without beamforming .",
    "in other words , by applying the beamforming design as well as the user scheduling , the minimum required number @xmath4 of users per cell such that a given lif value is guaranteed may scale slower than @xmath8 shown in theorem  [ thm : dof_lower ] , thus leading to more feasible network realization .",
    "in this subsection , the proposed scheme is compared with the two existing strategies  @xcite that also achieve the optimal dofs in @xmath0-cell uplink networks .",
    "we now focus on the case for @xmath172 , i.e. , @xmath0-cell imac model with a single antenna at each bs , as in  @xcite . under the model ,",
    "all of the oin and two existing ia methods achieve @xmath0 dofs asymptotically as the number @xmath4 of users in a cell tends to infinity , while their channel models and ( analytical ) approaches are quite different from each other .    since the two schemes  @xcite are analyzed in a _",
    "manner , it is possible to achieve a non - zero number of dofs , less than @xmath0 , even for finite @xmath4 ( independent of snr ) .",
    "in contrast , the achievability result of the oin scheme is shown based on a _ probabilistic _",
    "approach , where infinitely many number of users per cell , which scales faster than @xmath173 , is needed to guarantee full dofs without any dimension expansion .",
    "now let us turn to discussing channel modelings .",
    "the subspace - based ia scheme  @xcite was introduced in @xmath0-cell uplink networks allowing dimension expansion over the frequency domain , where it requires @xmath174-level decomposability of channels at each link since designing transmit vectors shown in  @xcite takes advantage of decomposed channel matrices .",
    "accordingly , single - path random delay channels are preferable due to the fact that they are @xmath174-level decomposable and thus are convenient to align interfering signals in practice .",
    "if we assume multipath frequency selective channels , then the whole channel band should be splitted into multiple sub - bands , each of which needs to be within coherence bandwidth and to occupy many subcarriers for dimension expansion , thereby yielding practical challenges .",
    "on the other hand , our scheme works well with rich scattering environments , because it exploits channel randomness for either nulling or aligning interfering signals .",
    "however , a highly correlated channel among users ( e.g. , relatively poor scattering environment ) may result in performance degradation for the proposed scheme , since it is difficult to select users such that the sum of lif values is small enough . in  @xcite ,",
    "another ia scheme , named as real ia , has been introduced in cellular uplink networks with time - invariant _ real _ channel coefficients  the ia operation is conducted in signal scale but not in signal vector space .",
    "specifically , the strategy exploits the fact that a real line consists of infinite rational dimensions . instead , under the _ complex _ channel environment",
    ", a multi - dimensional euclidean space is taken into account to align interference in signal vector space , as shown in the conventional ia methods  @xcite .",
    "two types of oim protocols were proposed in wireless @xmath0-cell uplink networks , where they do not require the global csi , infinite dimension extension , and parameter adjustment through iteration .",
    "the achievable dofs were then analyzed  the oim protocol asymptotically achieves @xmath7 dofs as long as @xmath4 scales faster than @xmath8 , where @xmath33 .",
    "it has been seen that there exists a trade - off between the achievable dofs and the parameter @xmath4 based on the two oim schemes . from the result of the upper bound on the dofs",
    ", it was shown that the oim protocol with @xmath42 achieves the optimal dofs with the help of the mud gain .",
    "in addition , the two - step scheduling method that can further obtain a power gain has been shown , and extension to the multi - carrier systems has been discussed .",
    "the cdf @xmath97 of the metric @xmath47 satisfies the inequality @xmath175 for @xmath176 and @xmath177 since @xmath178 similarly , @xmath179 is upper - bounded by @xmath180 for @xmath176 and @xmath181 from the fact that @xmath182 applying the above bounds to ( [ eq : f_l ] ) , we finally obtain ( [ eq : lemma1 ] ) , which completes the proof .",
    "although the proof technique is essentially similar to that of  @xcite , the whole steps are shown here for completeness .",
    "let @xmath183 and @xmath184 denote the message and its transmission rate of user @xmath25 in the @xmath27-th cell , respectively . consider a certain two - cell imac model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : upper_fig ] , where we eliminate messages @xmath185 for all @xmath186 as well as @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "we then obtain the following two equations : @xmath189 and @xmath190 which yield @xmath191 after multiplying some channel matrices at both sides of ( [ eq : y2_upp ] ) , where @xmath192 suppose that @xmath193 and @xmath194 , where @xmath195 @xmath196 and @xmath197 here , @xmath198 is given by @xmath199    then by using fano s inequality  @xcite , we have @xmath200 for an arbitrarily small @xmath201 , where the second and third inequalities come from reducing noise variance . the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : rate ] ) represents the sum capacity of a mac with an @xmath1 antenna receiver and @xmath140 single - antenna transmitters , and thus if @xmath202 , then the number of dofs for the mac is given by @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "hence , simply assuming @xmath203 , we obtain the following upper bounds : @xmath204 and @xmath205 similarly , for any @xmath206 , we obtain @xmath207 and @xmath208 adding up all the possible combinations over @xmath26 shown in ( [ eq : case1_upp ] ) and ( [ eq : case2_upp ] ) , we finally have @xmath209 at a given cell @xmath27 .",
    "since there are @xmath0 cells in the imac model , the total number of dofs is upper - bounded by ( [ eq : upper ] ) , which completes the proof .",
