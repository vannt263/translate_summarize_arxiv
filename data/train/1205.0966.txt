    "type i supernovae are bright stellar explosions characterized by a lack of hydrogen in the observed spectrum .",
    "the type ia sub - classification depends on the observation of a specific silicon line  @xcite .",
    "these events are thought to be the result of a thermonuclear explosion consuming roughly one and a half solar masses of degenerate stellar material composed principally of c and o. the peak brightness of a type ia supernova is set not by the explosion energy , but by the synthesis in the explosion of radioactive @xmath0 , which decays via the chain @xmath0 to @xmath1 to @xmath2 releasing the observed energy .",
    "the vast majority of type ia supernovae obey a correlation in which the peak brightness is positively correlated with the timescale over which the lightcurve decays from its maximum .",
    "this `` brighter is broader ''",
    "relation is known as the phillips relation  @xcite and it allows the peak brightnesses to be calibrated so that these events may be treated as  standard candles \" for determining distances .",
    "the correlation is understood physically as stemming from having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of @xmath0 synthesized in the explosion  @xcite .",
    "this relation has been exploited to make type ia supernovae the premier distance indicators for cosmological studies .    while it is accepted that type ia supernovae result from a thermonuclear runaway as described above",
    ", the progenitor systems of these events remain the subject of debate . motivated largely by interest in cosmology , observational campaigns are gathering information about these events at an unprecedented rate .",
    "in particular , observations are finding a surprising range in the variation of the intrinsic brightness of these events , including very bright events that suggest more material burned than could originate from a single white dwarf  @xcite .",
    "contemporary research explores the efficacy of several progenitor systems for producing events with a range of brightnesses .",
    "the phillips relation explains the first - order variations in peak brightness , but current research also aims to understand higher - order effects on the variation of the light curves and the physics behind the phillips relation .",
    "the progenitor system we assume is that of a single white dwarf composed principally of carbon and oxygen that has gained mass from a companion star  @xcite .",
    "the process of the white dwarf gaining mass from the companion is known as accretion . as the white dwarf gains mass ,",
    "it is compressed and the temperature increases , which ignites thermonuclear reactions .",
    "initially the reactions proceed relatively slowly , which drives convection in the core  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature rises , the thermonuclear reactions proceed faster and faster , and eventually a subsonic flame is born that will eventually disrupt the star .",
    "models that incorporate a transition from the subsonic deflagration to a supersonic detonation , allowing some expansion of the star prior to the detonation , best match some spectral features and the abundance stratification observed in the ejecta  @xcite .",
    "our models assume this deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) paradigm .",
    "many contemporary observations address correlations between the event and properties of the host galaxy such as its composition , age , and mass .",
    "of particular interest are correlations between the brightness of an event and the isotopic composition and age , measured by the intensity of star formation , of the host galaxy .",
    "the proportion of material that has previously been processed in stars ( i.e.  elements other than hydrogen and helium , which are collectively referred to as `` metals '' ) is a measurable property of the galaxy .",
    "the relative abundance of these elements is referred to as the galaxy s `` metallicity . ''",
    "the presence of these elements in a progenitor white dwarf influences the outcome of the explosion by changing the path of nuclear burning , which influences the amount of @xmath3ni synthesized in an event  @xcite . because the decay of @xmath3ni powers the light curve , metallicity can therefore directly influence the brightness of an event .",
    "metallicity can also influence the outcome of an explosion in other ways , including changes in the structure of the white dwarf that result from metallicities influence on stellar evolution , sedimentation within the white dwarf , the nuclear flame speed , and additional sources of opacity  @xcite .",
    "observational results to date are consistent with a shallow dependence of brightness on metallicity , with dimmer events in metal - rich galaxies , but are unable demonstrate a conclusive trend  @xcite . determining the metallicity dependence is challenging because the effect appears to be small , it is difficult to measure , and there are systematic effects associated with the mass - metallicity relationship within galaxies  @xcite .",
    "this effect is also difficult to decouple from the apparently stronger effect of the age of the parent stellar population on the mean brightness of type ia supernovae  @xcite .",
    "howell , et al .",
    "@xcite note that the scatter in brightness of this observed relation is unlikely to be explained by the effect of metallicity .",
    "the composition of a galaxy changes as stars form , consume hydrogen , and produce metals .",
    "newly - formed galaxies are rich in hydrogen gas and undergo a period of intense star formation .",
    "observations target correlations between the brightness of an event and the age of a galaxy measured by the delay time ( the elapsed time from the period of intense star formation ) .",
    "some results indicate that the dependence of the ia rate on delay time is best fit by a bimodal distribution with a prompt component less than 1  gyr after star formation and a tardy component several gyr later  @xcite .",
    "other studies only indicate a correlation between the delay time and the brightness of type ia supernovae , with dimmer events occurring at longer delay times  @xcite .",
    "our investigation into type ia supernovae proceeds by isolating facets of the problem and subjecting these to study via statistically well - controlled ensembles of multidimensional simulations .",
    "we are trying to understand the physical mechanism of the explosion and isolating one effect at a time allows us to understand these processes .",
    "the parts of the problem we consider are properties of the progenitor white dwarf ( such as structure and composition ) that follow from properties the host galaxy ( such as age and metallicity ) . the goal is to identify and quantify systematic trends in the brightness of events that follow from properties of the host galaxy .",
    "there are many possible systematic effects ( outlined in @xcite ) , and for each study we attempted to isolate all but one effect .",
    "eventually , we hope to consider the interdependence of all of these effects in the construction of the full theoretical picture .",
    "another feature of the type ia supernova problem is that the explosion depends sensitively on the initial conditions , which are largely unknown .",
    "we construct parametrized , hydrostatic massive white dwarf progenitor models with a variety of thermal and compositional structures thought to follow from the properties of the host galaxy and the accretion history  @xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed with a customized version of the flash  simulation code  @xcite that includes a model flame and energetics scheme .",
    "we perform suites of simulations in which we vary properties of the progenitor white dwarf .",
    "the suites of simulations are controlled by a theoretical framework we developed that allows for statically well - controlled studies to determine any systematic effects due to properties of the progenitor that may follow from properties of the host galaxy .",
    "simulations with flash  provide the bulk energetics of the explosion and an estimate of the yield of an event .",
    "we calculate detailed nucleosynthetic yields from the simulations by post - processing the thermodynamic histories of lagrangian tracer particles embedded in the flow with a detailed nuclear network  @xcite .    in the subsections below",
    ", we highlight the flame model , sub - grid - scale turbulence and turbulence - flame interaction models , and the statistical framework we employ .",
    "complete details of the methodology can be found in previously published results  @xcite .",
    "the tremendous range in length between the white dwarf radius ( @xmath4 ) and the laminar nuclear flame width ( @xmath5^{1/2 } < 1{{\\ensuremath{\\;}}}{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{c}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{m}}}}}$ ] for typical values of the thermal conductivity @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , temperature @xmath8 , and mass - specific heating rate @xmath9 ) , prohibits direct numerical simulation of type ia supernovae .",
    "the problem is so severe that even an adaptive mesh simulation can not resolve the actual diffusive flame front . for these reasons ,",
    "simulations must rely on some sort of `` model '' flame .",
    "the structure of a one - dimensional laminar burning front is reasonably well understood  @xcite , but the interaction of turbulence with this very thin flame front introduces small - scale structure in a way that is not well understood , even for flames in the laboratory . capturing the net effect of this unresolved flame structure is necessary for a realistic model .",
    "thermonuclear flames in flash  are tracked with an advection - diffusion - reaction scheme  @xcite that propagates an artificially broadened model flame .",
    "this model is based on the evolution of a reaction progress variable @xmath10 , where @xmath11 indicates unburned fuel and @xmath12 indicates burned ash , satisfying the advection - diffusion - reaction equation @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a single chosen function , used everywhere , and @xmath6 and @xmath15 are parameters that are tuned locally so that the reaction front propagates at the physical speed of the real flame in that region  @xcite and is just wide enough to be resolved in our simulation .",
    "we use a modified version of the kpp reaction rate discussed by  @xcite , in which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , which is acoustically quiet and gives a unique flame speed  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the model flame , a realistic supernova model must accurately describe the energy release at the front and in the burned material , which is in a dynamic equilibrium .",
    "we performed a detailed study of the nuclear processes occurring in a flame in the interior of a white dwarf and developed an efficient and accurate scheme for numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "tracking many nuclear species is computationally prohibitive , so simulations reproduce the energy release with an abstracted model with a tabulated state of the burned material produced from earlier directed simulations .",
    "this method accurately captures the thermal history of the material as it burns and evolves , which enables embedded particles to obtain accurate lagrangian density and temperature histories .",
    "detailed abundances can then be recovered by post - processing these time histories with a nuclear network including hundreds of nuclides .",
    "the nuclear processing can be well approximated as a three - stage process : initially carbon is consumed , followed by oxygen , which creates a mixture of si group and light elements that is in quasi - statistical equilibrium  @xcite ( also known as nuclear statistical quasi - equilibrium  @xcite ) ; finally the si group nuclei are converted to fe group , reaching full nse . in both of these equilibrium states , the capture and creation of light elements ( via photodisintegration )",
    "is balanced , so that energy release can continue by changing the relative abundance of light ( low nuclear binding energy ) and heavy ( high nuclear binding energy ) nuclides , an action that releases energy as burned material rises and expands .",
    "neutronization in the flame and dynamic ash , mainly via electron captures , is explicitly accounted for with tabulated rates from nse calculations with 443 nuclides that include modern weak reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "complete details of the nse calculations may be found in  @xcite and the details of the implementation in our simulations may be found in @xcite .",
    "the model flame with its advection - diffusion - reaction scheme requires an input flame speed .",
    "for the one - dimensional laminar case , flame speeds are readily available from direct numerical simulations  @xcite in the multidimensional case , turbulence on unresolved scales boosts the flame speed .",
    "realistic simulations must therefore include a method for determining the effect of this turbulence - flame interaction ( tfi ) .",
    "initially we employed a method proposed by khokhlov  @xcite , that assumes perturbations to the flame front are dominated by the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the method sets the flame front speed to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the laminar flame speed , @xmath20 is the atwood number , @xmath21 is the local gravity , @xmath22 is the grid resolution , and @xmath23 is a calibrated constant .",
    "this prescription effectively keeps the flame speed above some lower limit that depends on the resolution of the simulation .",
    "another approach that accounts for both unresolved rayleigh - taylor instability and background turbulence , originally proposed by niemeyer and hillebrandt  @xcite and developed in detail by schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite , relies on a dynamic measure of the local turbulent energy on sub - grid scales to enhance the local flame front propagation .",
    "the model sets the flame speed to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a velocity that characterizes the sub - grid turbulence energy content and @xmath26 is a constant taken to be 4/3  @xcite .",
    "we have recently implemented a tfi model based on colin et al .",
    "@xcite and charlette et al .",
    "@xcite that reasonably predicts the behavior of turbulent flames in terrestrial experiments  @xcite .",
    "the method utilizes a local , instantaneous measure of the turbulence , in contrast to the dynamic turbulence model employed by schmidt et al .",
    "in addition , the relation between the turbulent flame speed and the turbulent intensity is more carefully considered .",
    "particular care has been taken to ensure that the turbulent flame speed predicted by the tfi model shows good convergence properties with resolution for the case of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : tfi ] shows the ratio of the turbulent flame speed to the laminar flame speed for a flame propagating in a channel with decaying turbulence having an initial eddy turnover timescale @xmath27 .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent flame speed to the laminar flame speed is plotted as a function of simulation time scaled by @xmath27 .",
    "the solid lines show results from the tfi model following  @xcite , while the dotted lines show results without the inclusion of a tfi model .",
    "three tests were performed with cubic cells that cover the channel cross section with 64x64 cells ( red ) , 128x128 cells ( blue ) , and 256x256 cells ( green ) to demonstrate the necessity of a tfi model to obtain convergence with resolution .",

    "shown is the ratio of the turbulent flame speed to the laminar flame speed as a function of the simulation time scaled by the turbulence eddy turnover time at @xmath28 , @xmath27 , in a channel with decaying turbulence .",

    ", we utilize two- and three - dimensional simulations in the ddt paradigm within the framework to evaluate the average dependence of the brightness of an event on parameters such as composition of the progenitor .",
    "the theoretical sample is based on probabilistic initial ignition conditions for the deflagration .",
    "such sample - averaged dependencies are particularly important to the type ia supernova problem because we seek to understand how models may explain features of the observed sample , particularly samples generated by large dark energy surveys utilizing type ia supernovae as distance indicators .    the theoretical sample is constructed to represent statistical properties of the observed sample of type ia supernovae such as the mean inferred @xmath29 yield and its variance . within the ddt paradigm , the variance in @xmath29 yields can be explained by the development of fluid instabilities during the deflagration phase of the explosion .",
    "choice of the initial configuration of the flame influences the growth of fluid instabilities , which result in varying amounts of @xmath29 synthesized during the explosion .",
    "while there are many sources of uncertainty , particularly in the progenitor white dwarf s composition and structure , variations of the initial configuration of the flame can be used to introduce fluid instabilities that produce the variance of @xmath29 yields seen in observations .",
    "the physical initial conditions at ignition are not well known and most likely involve scales our simulations can not resolve .",

    "we write the perturbation as @xmath38 with a suitable random - number generator , a sample population of progenitor wds is constructed by defining the initial flame surface for a particular progenitor .",
    "our theoretical framework takes advantage of the fact that the outcome of an explosion is very sensitive to the initial conditions to produce the sample population .",

    "we attribute this result to higher rates of weak interactions ( electron captures ) that produce a higher proportion of neutronized material when the burning occurred at higher density .",
