    "let @xmath5 stand for the formal system obtained from the formal system for intuitionist logic lj by removing the rule weakening : right .",
    "we are thinking in the context of sequent calculus .    over @xmath5",
    "it is equivalent to have @xmath6 as initial sequents for all formulas @xmath1 and @xmath2 and to have the rule weakening : right .",
    "if we add weakening : right to @xmath5 we can prove ex - falso quodlibet in the following straightforward way :    perhaps a bit less obvious is the fact that with this form of ex - falso quodlibet @xmath5 proves _ weakening - right _ :    blue    the following hold on the basis of minimal logic :    1 .",

    "the following is a derivation in minimal logic which shows how to get @xmath7 from @xmath8 : + and the next one shows that double negation elimination proves ex falso 2 .   to see that with ex falso and tertium non datur we can obtain",
    "double negation elimination we use the following derivation :      the way we choose to include _ tertium non datur _  in @xmath5 to get @xmath9 is by adding to @xmath5 the following inference rule :    it is easy to see that with this rule we can derive @xmath7 for any formula @xmath1 :    it is also easy to see that this rule is perfectly compatible with lk because @xmath10 is always derivable in that system :    so we are somewhat justified in claiming this to be an addition of _ tertium non datur _  to @xmath5 to get @xmath9 .",
    "we will do what girard does in his book proofs and types @xcite to prove cut elimination for @xmath5 and @xmath9 :      changes to    changes to    changes to    changes to    changes to    changes to    the degree @xmath11 of a _ formula _ is defined as :    * @xmath12 for @xmath1 atomic * @xmath13 * @xmath14    the _ degree _ of a _ cut rule _ is defined to be the degree of the formula which it cuts .",

    "let @xmath26 be a formula of degree @xmath27 , and @xmath28 be minimal logic proofs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 of degrees @xmath31 .",
    "then there is a minimal logic proof of degree @xmath31 of @xmath32 .    by induction on @xmath33 .",

    "if neither @xmath17 nor @xmath34 are axioms then either both @xmath17 and @xmath34 introduce @xmath26 in their last inference rule , or one of them does nt .    if @xmath17 does nt , and in particular this includes the rule    then , we use the induction hypothesis with the premiss(es ) of the last inference rule of @xmath17 and @xmath30 , and then use the last inference rule of @xmath17 . for example :    now if both @xmath17 and @xmath34 introduce @xmath26 in their last inferences then we should look at the reductions above . for example :    if we had    then by induction hypothesis we would have a proof of degree @xmath31 of @xmath41 . then , by the substitution lemma , we would get ( merely by substituting ) @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath47 works because @xmath2 is a subformula of @xmath44 and it does not appear in the scope of a negation ( @xmath44 has no negation symbols at all ) .        then by induction hypothesis",

    "this means that the formula @xmath44 is already in @xmath52 .",
    "the other cases seem easy to verify since we ca nt use any negation rules if we have the atomic formula @xmath2 on the right hand side of the sequent , and the other inference rules wo nt add a negation to any of the formulas in their premisses .              1 .",
