    "ground - based long - slit spectroscopy of the extended narrow line region ( enlr  a few kpc scale ) of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151  has shown that the kinematics , ionization structure and morphology of the emission - line gas are consistent with photoionization of gas in the galactic disk by an anisotropic radiation field produced by the active nucleus ( penston et al .",
    "the situation on the scale of the narrow line region ( sub - kpc ) is however , much less clear as there is a large misalignement between the enlr at pa @xmath0  50  ( prez et al .",
    "1989 ; robinson et al . 1994 ) and the nlr which is co - spatial with the radio jet at pa @xmath0  77  ( pedlar et al .",
    "if both the nlr and enlr structures are to be explained in terms of an `` ionization cone '' then this misalignment implies either a very broad ( opening angle @xmath0  120 ) cone of ionizing radiation , intercepting the disk at grazing incidence ( pedlar et al .",
    "1992 , vila - vilar 1993 , robinson et al . 1994 ) or a geometry which is distinct from the `` standard '' unified model which has the cone axis fixed to that of the radio ejecta ( evans et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the complex structure of clouds and filaments in the inner 5  of the nlr revealed by _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images suggests that interaction with the radio jet may have an important influence on the observed morphology . in this letter , we present the first results of new hst long - slit spectroscopy of the central 8  of ngc4151  at a spatial resolution of 0.029 which enables us to separate for the first time the emission from the individual nlr clouds , and demonstrates that the interaction with the radio ejecta strongly affects the local kinematic and ionization conditions of the emission gas .",
    "our results imply that it is this interaction , rather than anisotropic illumination , which determines the basic structure of the nlr .    for a distance to ngc4151  of 13.3 mpc",
    ", 0.1 corresponds to a linear scale of 6.4 pc in the plane of the sky .",
    "the spectroscopic data consist of four spectra obtained with the faint object camera ( foc ) f/48 long - slit facility on board the hst .",
    "the slit width is 0.063 , and its useful length about 10 .",
    "we have also used foc f/96 images with filters centered at the [ ] @xmath25007  emission - line and nearby continuum .",
    "table [ log_tab ] summarizes the relevant information on the above data set .",
    "the f/96 images were reduced using the standard pipeline procedure , as described in the foc handbook ( nota et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the slit at pa=47 , and cover the interval 3650  5470  .",
    "the data reduction followed the same procedure as described in macchetto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; wavelength resolution is 5.1   @xmath0  300 kms@xmath1  at [ ] @xmath25007 , and the spatial psf is of the order of 0.08 ; flux calibration was obtained using the iue standard lds749b . by comparing the brightness profile of the [ ] @xmath25007  emission line on the spectra with that on the f/96 image",
    ", we were able to pinpoint the location of the slit to within 0.06 ( 2 pixels at the f/48 resolution ) .",
    "figure [ plate1_fig ] ( plate [ plate1_fig ] ) shows the slit positions superimposed on the [ ] @xmath25007  image .",
    "the spectra are located on the nucleus , and 0.23 , 0.40 and 0.46 nw of it , and will be hereafter referred to as pos1 , pos2 , pos3 and pos4 , respectively .",
    "the nuclear spectrum was heavily saturated in the central 15 pixels , due to the strong continuum emission .",
    "the presence of a complex radial velocity structure is evident in all the brightest narrow emission lines , such as [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] . to study the detailed kinematics of the gas the [ ] @xmath24959,5007 emission lines , which provide the best resolution and s / n ratio , were extracted in spatial windows varying from two to 20 pixels along the slit , and both lines fitted simultaneously using two to six gaussian components , constraining the physical parameters of the corresponding components of each line to their theoretical values ( 3:1 intensity ratio , 48   separation , and same fwhm ) .",
    "figure [ plate2_fig ] ( plate [ plate2_fig ] ) shows the combined vla@xmath4merlin 5 ghz radio map from pedlar et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , overlaid on the [ ] @xmath25007  image of ngc4151 .",
    "the registration was made assuming that the optical nucleus corresponds to component c4 , as advocated by mundell et al .",
    "there is an apparent anti - correlation between the optical and the radio emission , with the brightest emission - line filaments surrounding the radio knots as would be expected if the radio - jet is clearing a channel in the surrounding medium and enhancing the line emission along its edges by compression of the ambient gas .",
    "figure [ rotcurv_fig ] shows the results of the [ ] @xmath24959,5007 fitting for three of the four slit positions ( the pos3 and pos4 data are very similar to each other and do not give independent information ) .",
    "the rotation curves were constructed assuming that the narrowest , closest to the systemic velocity , and usually the brightest component ( filled squares ) represent the `` main '' nlr gas emission .",
    "the curves are plotted as a function to the distance to the center of the slit , defined as a line passing through the nucleus , perpendicular to the slit direction . the solid line on each panel represents the integrated [ ] @xmath25007  spatial profile .",
    "the general behavior of the main component is consistent with normal galactic rotation as defined by the enlr gas emission ( robinson et al .",
    "1994 ) , with strong but localized perturbations superimposed , represented by one , or sometimes two , narrow ( fwhm @xmath5 800 kms@xmath1 ) secondary components either blue- or redshifted relative to the core of the line ( shown as open circles and squares in figure [ rotcurv_fig ] ) . in the inner 2  of the nuclear spectrum",
    ", the behaviour of the emission gas shows a strong deviation from the outermost rotation curve .",
    "it is important to note that the most kinematically disturbed features are found to be associated with the emission clouds located along the edges of the strongest radio emission components : the red / blue - shifted knots at @xmath0  1  sw of the center of the slit in the pos2 spectrum are located at one side of the c2 radio component , and are well fitted by two gaussian components centered at @xmath41300 and @xmath6800 kms@xmath1  from the core velocity , and fwhm @xmath0  330 and 490 kms@xmath1 , respectively ; the high velocity ( @xmath7v @xmath0  @xmath61700 kms@xmath1 ) cloud * ( b ) * in pos3 lies also alongside this same radio component ; the second - brightest radio component c3 is in front of the bright emission complex located 0.20.5  nw of the nucleus , where we observe a clear double - peaked profile in all emission lines , well represented by two narrow ( fwhm @xmath0  430kms@xmath1 ) components , one of which is blueshifted by @xmath0  660 kms@xmath1  from the core velocity .",
    "all these features are characterized by a very small projected size : the two high - velocity clouds in pos2 discussed above are 0.17 to 0.23 ( less than 15 pc ) across , while the double - peaked feature in pos3 ( see figure [ sampspec_fig]c ) is resolved along a 0.3 ( 20 pc ) bin , giving further support to the idea that the nlr morphology is strongly shaped in walls and voids by the expanding , fast - moving radio components .",
    "if the localized kinematics perturbations described above are a consequence of fast shocks created by interactions with ejected radio material the physical conditions in the clouds may also be influenced by the shocks .",
    "not only can the shocks compression lead to local density enhancements ( taylor , dyson & axon 1992 ) but these may also be accompanied by secondary photoionizing radiation ( sutherland , bicknell & dopita 1993 ; morse , raymond & wilson 1996 ) .    we clearly see that the emission - line ratios vary substantially on scales of a few tenths of an arcsec , indicating that the density and ionization state of the emission gas are strongly influenced by the local conditions .",
    "we also detect several examples of off - nuclear blue - continuum emission , consistently associated with the brightest emission - line knots .",
    "figure [ sampspec_fig ] presents a sample of the spectra observed , corresponding to the regions * ( a ) * to * ( c ) * in figure [ rotcurv_fig ] .",
    "the observed line intensities , relative to h@xmath3  = 1.0 , are given in table [ flux_tab ] .",
    "as a reference we included the `` average '' nlr line intensities , obtained by adding up the spatially integrated emission of the four slit positions , and the ground - based data for the enlr ( @xmath8 ) from penston et al .",
    "errors are of the order of 0.05 or smaller for the line ratios , and 0.002 or smaller for the [ ] @xmath24363/[]@xmath25007@xmath44959 ratio .",
    "spectrum [ sampspec_fig](a ) corresponds to the brightest [ ] @xmath25007  knot in pos2 , one of the clouds associated with the radio component c3 , located at a projected distance of 0.18 sw ( 12 pc ) of the nucleus .",
    "spectrum [ sampspec_fig](b ) corresponds to the region with the high velocity cloud located 1  sw ( 64 pc ) of the center of pos3 .",
    "this component can be clearly seen in the [ ] profile .",
    "the fwhm of the `` main '' [ ] @xmath25007  emission in this spectrum is unresolved ( 310 kms@xmath1 ) , while spectra from neighboring regions ( 6 pixels , 0.17 @xmath0  11 pc either side ) show a @xmath25007 line twice as broad .",
    "the h@xmath9/h@xmath3  ratios in these two positions are consistent with little or no reddening .",
    "all line ratios for spectrum [ sampspec_fig](b ) are for the core component only , and do not include the high velocity cloud contribution .    both of these spectra present similar ratios [ ] @xmath23869/h@xmath3 , while [ ] /[]@xmath23727  in * ( a ) * is about twice that in * ( b)*. the high value of the @xmath23869/@xmath23727 ratio is a local characteristic of region * ( a ) * that is not observed in nearby clouds , and there is no clear evidence of kinematic perturbations in this spectrum .",
    "the fact that @xmath24686  in * ( a ) * is not significantly stronger than in * ( b ) * points against the hypothesis of a matter - bounded cloud , which will enhance the [ ] emission relative to low - ionization lines ( binette , wilson & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the interaction with the radio - jet would compress the gas , and thus lower the ionizaton parameter , favoring the emission of low - ionization lines such as [ ] in region * ( b)*. notice , however , that the @xmath23869/@xmath23727 ratio for this region is similar to the ratio averaged over all the observed area , where one would expect the effects of local density enhancements to have been washed out .    for these two spectra",
    "we also measured ratios @xmath10 } \\equiv $ ] [ ] @xmath24363/[]@xmath25007@xmath44959 @xmath0  0.012 and 0.016 , respectively . using the 3-level atom of mccall ( 1984 ) , for a reasonable electron density range of @xmath11 to @xmath12 @xmath13  these values correspond to [ ] temperatures @xmath14}$ ] in the range 12,000 to 16,000 k , slightly above the limit of @xmath15 11,000 k predicted by most photoionization models , but still compatible with the value found for the purportedly photoionized , kinematically undisturbed enlr .",
    "in fact , the overall similarity of the nlr line ratios to those of the enlr suggests that variations in electron denstities created by different degrees in shock compression in individual clouds are probably the main cause of the observed variations of ionization from knot to knot .",
    "however , this is not the whole story as shown in spectrum [ sampspec_fig](c ) which , in addition to double - peaked profiles , shows clear evidence of a localized blue continuum . such localized regions of off - nuclear blue continuum emission are seen in several positions in our spectra , and are always associated to , but not exactly coincident with , an emission - line knot . as we mentioned above ,",
    "this is a characteristic spectral signature of the free - free emission of the hot gas created by the fast shocks and therefore provides concrete evidence for the existence of a local ionizing continuum which might be playing a significant role in the ionization structure of the individual clouds .",
    "the high spatial resolution long - slit spectroscopy of the nuclear region of ngc4151  presented in this paper clearly show that the popular picture of anisotropic illumination by the nuclear source is overly simplistic to explain the complex morphology and kinematics observed in the nlr .",
    "comparison of the radio and optical data shows that the line emission is enhanced along the edges of the radio knots , as would be expected to result from the interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium , similar to what is observed for ngc1068 ( gallimore et al . 1996 ; capetti , macchetto & lattanzi 1997 ; capetti , axon & macchetto 1997 ) .",
    "the general behaviour of the [ ] @xmath25007  velocity field is consistent with disk rotation , with local deviations caused by turbulence ( probably associated with the sweeping / expanding motion of the radio cocoon ) .",
    "we detect several distinct and very localized high velocity ( @xmath61700 to @xmath41300 kms@xmath1 ) , narrow ( fwhm @xmath5 600 kms@xmath1 ) emission components , both blue and redshifted , confined in projected dimensions of up to 0.3 .",
    "we find no evidence for systematic red / blue - shifted deviations as expected by the presence of a generalized outflow , as advocated by schulz ( 1990 ) .",
    "detailed modeling of the inner @xmath16  kinematics will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the data shows that the emission - line ratios can vary substantially within a few tenths of arcsec , indicating that the physical conditions of the emission gas are also strongly influenced by the local conditions .",
    "furthermore , we detect off - nuclear blue continuum emission , consistently associated with the brightest emission - line knots .",
    "the clear morphological association between the radio and the optical emission , and the highly disturbed kinematical components in the nlr of ngc4151  revealed by our data imply that interaction with the radio plasma rather than illumination shapes the nlr . within the context of the present data , the relative balance between the two possible explanations of the ionization structure variations we have discussed , density fluctuations and/or local ionization , can not be resolved as we do not have density measurements of the individual clouds .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident that shocks associated with the jet - cloud interactions play an important role in determining the physical conditions of the _ individual _ emission clouds ( taylor , dyson & axon 1992 ; sutherland at al .",
    "1993 ) .    in order to unambiguously determine",
    "if local ionization effects play a significant role in modifying the ionization structure of individual clouds high quality measurements of the electron density in the clouds need to be obtained from future hst spectroscopy .",
