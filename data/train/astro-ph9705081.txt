    "it is generally believed that active galaxies and quasars are powered by the presence of massive black holes ( bhs ) in their nuclei , and that such bhs are present in many , possibly all , quiescent galaxies as well ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 , lynden - bell 1996 and rees 1996 for reviews of this paradigm and its history ) .",
    "evidence for this can be derived from studies of the dynamics of stars and gas in the nuclei of individual galaxies .",
    "the high spatial resolution data that can now be obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) allows the existing evidence to be strengthened considerably .",
    "the present paper is part of a new hst study of the quiescent galaxy m32 , in which the presence of a bh has long been suspected based on the steep central rotation velocity gradient and nuclear peak in the velocity dispersion seen in ground - based data ( e.g. , tonry 1987 ; van der marel 1994a ; bender , kormendy & dehnen 1996 ) .",
    "the main results of our project were summarized , and discussed in the context of other recent work , in van der marel ( 1997a ) . the acquisition and reduction of the stellar kinematical hst data were described in van der marel , de zeeuw & rix ( 1997b ; hereafter paper  i ) . here",
    "we present new dynamical models that we have used to interpret the combined hst and ground - based data .",
    "two types of self - consistent dynamical models have been constructed previously to interpret the ground - based data for m32 .",
    "dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) and richstone , bower & dressler ( 1990 ) used a method based on schwarzschild s ( 1979 ) technique , in which individual orbits are calculated and superposed , to provide a self - consistent model that fits a given set of data .",
    "these ` maximum entropy ' ( richstone & tremaine 1988 ) models could fit the ( then available ) data only by invoking the presence of a central dark mass of @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "the models are general in the sense that they make no assumptions about the dynamical structure of the galaxy . however , a drawback was that only spherical geometry was considered . even though the models can be made to rotate , it remains unclear what systematic errors are introduced when they are applied to a flattened ( e3 ) galaxy like m32 .",
    "an alternative approach has been to construct axisymmetric models with phase - space distribution functions ( dfs ) that depend only on the two classical integrals of motion , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the binding energy and @xmath17 is the angular momentum component along the symmetry axis , both per unit mass .",
    "these models properly take flattening and rotation into account . to fit the m32 data",
    ", they require the presence of a central dark mass between @xmath18 ( van der marel 1994b ; qian 1995 ; dehnen 1995 ) and @xmath19 ( bender , kormendy & dehnen 1996 ) .",
    "the disadvantage of these models is that they have a special dynamical structure .",
    "the velocity dispersions in the meridional plane are isotropic , @xmath20 , which might not be the case in m32 .",
    "however , the models do fit the observed line - of - sight velocity profile ( vp ) shapes without invoking freely adjustable parameters , which provides some reason to believe that the m32 df may not be too different from the form @xmath0 .    the previous work on m32 has shown that models with a bh can fit the ground - based data , but the modeling has not been general enough to demonstrate that a bh is required .",
    "below that their data can be fit by an axisymmetric model without a bh .",
    "] in fact , the spatial resolution of the ground - based data might have been insufficient for this to be the case ( see appendix  a for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "it has certainly not been sufficient to rule out a cluster of dark objects ( as opposed to a central bh ) on the basis of theoretical arguments ; goodman & lee ( 1989 ) showed that this requires a resolution of @xmath21 .",
    "our new hst data of the nuclear region of m32 were obtained with the hst faint object spectrograph ( fos ) through square apertures of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , yielding the highest spatial resolution stellar kinematical data for m32 obtained to date . the results ( see , e.g. , figure  [ f : hstbhpred ] below ) show a steeper rotation curve and higher central velocity dispersion than the best ground - based m32 data .",
    "the primary goals of our project are to determine whether these new hst data rigorously rule out models without any dark mass , and to what extent they constrain the mass and size of the dark object in m32 .    to obtain constraints on the presence of a dark object that are least dependent on a priori assumptions about the df , we need to compare the hst data not only to the predictions of axisymmetric @xmath0 models , but also to the predictions of models with a fully general dynamical structure .",
    "orbit superposition techniques provide the most straightforward approach to construct such models .",
    "however , orbit superposition is more difficult to implement for the axisymmetric case than for the spherical case : the orbits are not planar and typically possess an additional integral of motion , so that the orbit library must sample three rather than two integrals of motion .",
    "furthermore , a larger parameter space must be explored because of the unknown inclination angle .",
    "this implies that larger amounts of cpu time and computer memory are required .",
    "however , other than that , there are no reasons why such models would be infeasible .",
    "motivated by the increased speed and memory capacity of computers , we therefore developed a technique to construct fully general axisymmetric orbit superposition models , that fit any given number of observed photometric and kinematic constraints .",
    "independent software implementations were written by h .-",
    "w.r , n.c . and r.v.d.m .",
    "our technique may be viewed as the axisymmetric generalization of the spherical modeling used by richstone and collaborators , with the important additional feature that we calculate vp shapes and include an arbitrary number of gauss - hermite moments in the fit .",
    "we take into account the error on each observational constraint to obtain an objective @xmath24 measure for the quality - of - fit .",
    "our basic algorithm is described in rix ( 1997 ; hereafter r97 ) and summarized in de zeeuw ( 1997 ) . r97",
    "provide an application to the spherical geometry ; cretton ( 1997 ; hereafter c97 ) present the extension to the axisymmetric case . here",
    "we summarize the main steps of the axisymmetric algorithm briefly , and focus on the application to m32 .",
    "the resulting models are the most general yet constructed for m32 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : massmodel ]",
    "we discuss our parametrizations for the stellar mass density and for the potential of the dark object . in section",
    "[ s : dfpred ] we describe the construction of models with @xmath0 dfs , and in section  [ s : datacomp ] we compare the predictions of these models , both with and without bhs , to the kinematical data . in section  [ s : technique ] we outline the orbit - superposition technique for constructing models with a fully general dynamical structure , and in section  [ s : results ] we compare the predictions of these models to the data .",
    "we construct models with an extended dark object in section  [ s : extfit ] .",
    "we summarize and discuss our main conclusions in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "readers interested primarily in the results of our models may wish to skip sections  [ s : massmodel ] , [ s : dfpred ] and  [ s : technique ] .",
    "we adopt a parametrized form for the axisymmetric mass density of m32 : @xmath25^{\\beta }                                          \\ > [ 1+(m / c)^2]^{\\gamma } , \\qquad     m^2 \\equiv r^2 + ( z / q)^2 . \\label{massdens}\\ ] ] the mass density @xmath26 is related to the luminosity density @xmath27 according to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the average mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population ( hereafter given in solar v - band units ) . both @xmath29 and the intrinsic axial ratio @xmath30",
    "are assumed to be constant ( as a function of radius ) .",
    "the projected axial ratio @xmath31 is determined by the inclination @xmath32 according to @xmath33 .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath32 can be freely specified ; all other parameters are determined by fitting to the available m32 surface photometry .",
    "the highest spatial resolution surface photometry available for m32 is that presented by lauer ( 1992 ) , based on pre - costar hst / wfpc images .",
    "their measurements extend to @xmath34 from the nucleus . at larger radii ground - based data are available from kent ( 1987 ) and peletier ( 1993 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : surfbr ] shows the major axis surface brightness measurements from these sources .",
    "the solid curve shows the surface brightness profile predicted by our model , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and an assumed distance of @xmath43 .",
    "the factor @xmath44^{\\gamma}$ ] in equation  ( [ massdens ] ) ensures that the model has finite mass , and that it provides an adequate fit to the observed surface brightness profile out to @xmath45 .",
    "apart from this factor , the model is identical to that used by van der marel ( 1994b ) and qian ( 1995 ) ( dashed curve in figure  [ f : surfbr ] ) .",
    "our model for the mass density is somewhat less general than that used by dehnen ( 1995 ) , who deprojected the surface photometry in an unparametrized manner .",
    "his approach avoids possible biases resulting from the choice of an _ ad hoc _ parametrization ( merritt & tremblay 1994 ; gebhardt 1996 ) .",
    "it also allows the axial ratio of m32 to vary with radius .",
    "the observed axial ratio is very close to constant at @xmath46 in the central @xmath47 , but increases slowly to @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "even though our model does not reproduce this modest variation , overall it provides an excellent fit , and is fully adequate for a study of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "the uncertainties in the interpretation of the kinematic data for the center of m32 are due almost entirely to our ignorance of the dynamical structure of m32 .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by errors in the brightness profile or by the non - uniqueness of the deprojection are relatively minor ( van den bosch 1997 ) .",
    "the effect of possible triaxiality is more difficult to assess , but we will argue in section  [ ss : triaxiality ] that triaxiality is unlikely to modify any of the major conclusions of our paper .",
    "the gravitational potential is assumed to be @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the potential generated by the luminous matter with mass density  ( [ massdens ] ) , and @xmath52 allows for the possibility of a massive dark object in the nucleus .",
    "we assume the latter to be @xmath53 which is the potential generated by a cluster with a plummer model mass density ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for @xmath54",
    "one obtains the case of a dark nuclear point mass , i.e. , a nuclear bh .",
    "we do not include the potential of a possible dark halo around m32 .",
    "there are no ( strong ) observational constraints on the possible presence and characteristics of such a dark halo , and even if present , it will not affect the stellar kinematics near the nucleus of m32 .",
    "the regular orbits in general axisymmetric potentials are characterized by three integrals of motion , the binding energy @xmath55 , the component of the angular momentum around the symmetry axis @xmath56 , and a non - classical , or effective , third integral @xmath57 ( ollongren 1962 ; richstone 1982 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in any given axisymmetric potential",
    "there is an infinity of dfs @xmath58 that generate a given axisymmetric mass density @xmath59 .",
    "such models are difficult to construct , primarily because the third integral can not generally be expressed explicitly in terms of the phase - space coordinates .",
    "however , for any mass density @xmath59 there is exactly one df that is even in @xmath17 , and does not depend on @xmath57 .",
    "this unique even ` two - integral ' df , @xmath60 , provides a useful low - order approximation to any axisymmetric model , and has the convenient property that many physical quantities , including the df itself , can be calculated semi - analytically .",
    "we study models of this type for m32 because they have successfully reproduced ground - based m32 data , and because they provide a useful guide for the interpretation of more general three - integral models , which are discussed in sections  [ s : technique ] and  [ s : results ] .    to calculate the @xmath60 dfs for our models we have used a combination of the techniques described in qian ( 1995 ) and dehnen ( 1995 ) , even though either technique by itself could have been used to get the same result ( in fact , yet another technique to address this problem is described in c97 ) .",
    "initially , four radial regimes are considered : @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 as defined in equation  ( [ massdens ] ) . in these regimes",
    "the mass density is approximately : @xmath67 ; @xmath68^{\\beta}$ ] ; @xmath69^{\\gamma}$ ] ; and @xmath70 , respectively . for each of these mass densities",
    "@xmath60 can be calculated with the technique and software of qian ( 1995 ) .",
    "the dfs for the four regimes are then smoothly patched together in energy , to yield an approximation to the full df .",
    "this approximation is then used as the starting point for lucy - richardson iteration as described in dehnen ( 1995 ) .",
    "this yields the df @xmath71 , reproducing the model mass density to @xmath72 per cent rms .",
    "the total df is the sum of the part @xmath73 that is even in @xmath17 , and the part @xmath74 that is odd in @xmath17 . in principle , @xmath75 is determined completely by the mean streaming velocities @xmath76 , but these are not determined well enough by the data to make an inversion practicable . instead , therefore",
    ", @xmath75 can be freely specified so as to best fit the data , with the only constraint that the total df should be positive definite .",
    "none of the main conclusions of our paper depend sensitively on the particular parametrization used for @xmath74 , so we restrict ourselves here to a simple choice ( section  [ ss : bhfit ] ) .",
    "once the complete df is known , the projected line - of - sight vps can be calculated for any particular observational setup as in qian ( 1995 ) . from the vps , predictions can be calculated for the observable kinematical quantities .",
    "figure  [ f : hstbhpred ] shows the hst / fos data presented in paper  i , obtained with the apertures ` 0.1-pair ' ( @xmath22 square ) and ` 0.25-pair ' ( @xmath23 square ) .",
    "the figure also shows the highest available spatial resolution ground - based data , obtained by van der marel ( 1994a ) with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) , and by bender , kormendy & dehnen ( 1996 ) with the canada - france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the spatial resolution for these ground - based observations is roughly @xmath77 and @xmath78 fwhm , respectively .",
    "the predictions of @xmath0 models for the wht and cfht data have already been discussed in detail by previous authors , and we therefore focus here on a comparison of @xmath0 models to the new hst data .",
    "the curves in figure  [ f : hstbhpred ] are the predictions of edge - on @xmath0 models with dark nuclear _ point masses _",
    "( i.e. , bhs ) .",
    "these models have an intrinsic axial ratio @xmath79 .",
    "the dark mass only influences the kinematical predictions in the central few arcsec , and the mass - to - light ratio @xmath29 was therefore chosen to fit the normalization of the kinematical data at larger radii .",
    "a good fit to the wht data between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is obtained with @xmath82 .",
    "predictions were calculated for each individual observation , taking into account the aperture position , aperture size and psf for the hst data as given in paper  i. connecting curves in the figure were drawn to guide the eye .",
    "it proved sufficient to study only models with a very simple odd part @xmath74 , namely those that produce a total df in which at every @xmath83 a fraction @xmath84 of the stars has @xmath85 , and a fraction @xmath86 has @xmath87 . for each @xmath8 , the fraction @xmath88 of stars with @xmath85 in the model",
    "was chosen to optimize the @xmath24 of the fit to the rotation curve . the displayed models _ with _ a bh fit the rotation curve well , more or less independent of @xmath8 ; models with higher @xmath8 require smaller  @xmath84 .",

    "the observed trend of increasing velocity dispersion towards the nucleus is successfully reproduced by models with a nuclear point mass of @xmath89 .",
    "the model without a bh predicts a roughly constant velocity dispersion with radius , and is strongly ruled out .",
    "in fact , this model also fails to fit the observed rotation velocity gradient in the central arcsec . the displayed model for the no - bh case is maximally rotating ( @xmath90 ) , and it is thus not possible to improve this by choosing a more general form for the odd part of the df .    for a quantitative analysis of the best - fitting @xmath8 , we define a @xmath24 statistic that measures the quality of the model fit to the observed hst velocity dispersions : @xmath91^{1/2 } .",

    "the best fit to the hst dispersions is obtained for @xmath93 .",
    "the quoted error is a formal @xmath4 error based on the assumption of gaussian statistics ( probably an underestimate , as there is some hint for systematic errors in the data in addition to random errors ) .",
    "an alternative way of estimating @xmath8 is to model the average of the four data points within @xmath94 from the center : @xmath95 , where the @xmath4 error is based on the scatter between the data points .",
    "figure  [ f : sigcen ] shows the observed @xmath96 as a hatched region ; a solid curve shows the predicted value as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the predictions fall in the observed range for @xmath97 .",
    "the inclination of m32 can not be derived from the observed photometry and is therefore a free parameter in the modeling . however , the predictions of @xmath0 models are rather insensitive to the assumed inclination ( van der marel 1994b ) .",
    "this was verified by also calculating the predictions of inclined models with @xmath2 , which have an intrinsic axial ratio @xmath98 .",
    "a mass - to - light ratio @xmath99 was adopted , so that at large radii one obtains the same rms projected velocity on the intermediate axis ( between the major and minor axes ) as for an edge - on model . on the major axis",
    "the @xmath2 model then predicts a slightly higher rms velocity than the edge - on model , resulting in a @xmath100 per cent smaller best - fitting @xmath8 .",
    "apart from this , the conclusions from the inclined models were found to be identical to those for the edge - on models ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : chisqsurf ] below).=-2      the @xmath0 models that fit the hst data can only be correct if they also fit the ground - based wht and cfht data .",
    "one may define similar @xmath24 quantities as for the hst data , to determine the best - fitting @xmath8 for either of these data sets .",
    "figures  [ f : chisqbh ] and  [ f : sigcen ] show the relative rms residual @xmath92 of the fit to all the dispersion measurements , and the average dispersion @xmath101 of the dispersion measurements centered with @xmath94 from the nucleus . for the wht data ,",
    "@xmath92 is minimized for @xmath102 , whereas for the cfht data it is minimized for @xmath103 .",
    "the central velocity dispersion measured with the wht is best fit with @xmath104 , whereas for the cfht data it is best fit with @xmath105 .",
    "these results are roughly consistent with those of previous authors .",
    "van der marel ( 1994b ) , qian ( 1995 ) and dehnen ( 1995 ) found @xmath106 for the best fitting edge - on @xmath0 model to the ground - based wht data , while bender , kormendy & dehnen obtained a best fit to their higher spatial resolution cfht data with @xmath107 .",
    "the latter value is somewhat higher than the one we find here , because it was chosen only to provide a good fit to the cfht rotation curve ; it does not fit the cfht velocity dispersions very well .",
    "these results indicate that , under the assumption of an @xmath0 df , the different observations can not all be fit simultaneously with the same @xmath8 , even after accounting for the different observational setups .",
    "the lowest spatial resolution wht data require a significantly lower @xmath8 than the highest spatial resolution hst data .",
    "this implies that m32 has a df that is not of the form @xmath15 .",
    "to construct more general three - integral models for m32 , we extended schwarzschild s orbit superposition algorithm . its basic structure is to calculate an orbit library that samples integral space in some complete and uniform way , to store the time - averaged intrinsic and projected properties of the orbits , and to search for the weighted superposition of orbits that best fits the observed kinematics , while reproducing the mass density @xmath59 for self - consistency .",

    "the models can not be expected to reproduce this .",
    "second , the cfht rotation velocities at radii @xmath157 exceed the wht measurements by an amount which can not be attributed to differences in spatial resolution , but must be due to some unknown systematic error in either of the two data sets .",

    "the models tend to underpredict the cfht rotation curve .",
    "these systematic problems with the data preclude the use of @xmath24 as a meaningful statistic to assess which models provide an acceptable fit : if the observations themselves are not mutually consistent , then clearly no model can be statistically consistent with all of them .",
    "although the use of any statistical test is suspect in the presence of systematic errors , one may still assign confidence regions on the model parameters by using the _ relative likelihood _",
    "statistic @xmath158 .",
    "this statistic merely measures which parameter combinations provide an equally good ( or bad ) fit as the one(s ) that yield the minimum @xmath24 .",
    "if we assume that the observational errors are normally distributed ( which , as mentioned , is likely to be an oversimplification ) , then @xmath159 follows a @xmath24 probability distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of model parameters ( press 1992 ) .    the best - fitting edge - on model in figure  [ f : bestfits ] has @xmath160 while the best - fitting @xmath2 model has @xmath161 , both for @xmath162 degrees of freedom",

    "we have not attempted to derive confidence bands on the dynamical structure of m32 .",

    "we have therefore restricted ourselves to @xmath0 models with extended dark objects .",

    "hence , only the velocity dispersions are shown in the figure .",
    "the predicted dispersions are typically constant or decreasing towards the center within the scale radius @xmath201 .",
    "the hst data show a much higher velocity dispersion in the center than further out .",

    "figure  [ f : chisqsurf ] shows a contour plot of the quantity @xmath203 ( eq .  [ [ chisigdef ] ] ) , measuring the quality of the model fit to the hst dispersion measurements , both for the edge - on case and for @xmath2 .",

    "hence , the upper limit on the scale radius corresponds to @xmath208 .",
    "combined with a total mass in the cluster of @xmath206 , this implies a central mass density of at least @xmath209 .",
    "the half - mass radius of a plummer model is @xmath210 .",
    "hence , there must be @xmath211 inside @xmath212 .",
    "the total v - band luminosity inside this radius than ours . ] is @xmath213 , implying a luminous mass of @xmath214 .",
    "hence , the ratio of the total mass to luminosity inside this radius must be @xmath215 .",
    "the observed kinematics constrain only the amount of mass in the system , not whether this mass is luminous or dark .",
    "one can therefore fit the data equally well with models in which the average mass - to - light ratio @xmath29 of the stellar population increases towards the nucleus , and in which there is no dark mass .",
    "we have not explicitly constructed such models , but it is clear from the preceding discussion that in such models @xmath29 must rise from @xmath216 in the main body of the galaxy to @xmath217 at @xmath218 .",
    "such a drastic variation in mass - to - light ratio would imply a strong change in the stellar population , accompanied by broad - band color gradients .",
    "the size of these gradients depends on the actual stellar population mix , which is unknown .",
    "however , one may use the properties of main sequence stars as a guideline . for these",
    ", a change in @xmath29 from @xmath219 to @xmath220 implies color changes @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 ( using the tables of stellar properties in allen 1973 ) .",
    "such variations between @xmath94 and @xmath224 should have been obvious in photometric observations .",
    "however , neither subarcsec resolution ground - based imaging ( lugger 1992 ) nor pre - refurbishment hst imaging ( crane 1993 ) have revealed any significant color gradients in the central arcsec of m32 .",
    "post - refurbishment hst observations ( lauer et al . , private communication ) also do not show strong color gradients .",
    "thus , the nuclear mass concentration in m32 can not be due merely to a change in the mix of ordinary stars in the nuclear region.=-2    the absence of observed color gradients does not exclude the possibility of nuclear concentrations of brown dwarfs , white dwarfs , neutron stars , or stellar - mass bhs in m32 .",
    "however , at high densities , such clusters of dark objects are not stable over a hubble time .",
    "this was discussed by goodman & lee ( 1989 ) , and their arguments were updated and extended in van der marel ( 1997a ) .",
    "the latter paper shows that the new hst limit on the density of dark material in m32 rules out all but the most implausible clusters , leaving a single massive bh as the most likely interpretation of the data .",
    "the kinematical predictions of our models depend on the assumed plummer form of the extended dark object",
    ". if it is a cluster of collapsed objects , this distributed dark mass may itself be cusped ( e.g. , gerhard 1994 ) . however , the limit on @xmath201 results from the fact that the dispersion of stars with mass density  ( [ massdens ] ) in a plummer potential does not have a ( strong ) central peak .",
    "this property is common to many alternative types of models , such as those of king ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) , hernquist ( 1990 ) and jaffe ( 1983 ) .",
    "these all produce constant or decreasing dispersions inside their scale radius , as does the plummer model . hence",
    ", the upper bound on @xmath201 derived here is likely to be generic to most plausible density profiles for the extended dark object .",
    "in addition , king , jaffe and hernquist models are more centrally condensed than plummer models , and would therefore require dark clusters of even higher central densities to fit the data .",
    "the main bottlenecks in proving the presence of nuclear bhs in quiescent galaxies from stellar kinematical data have long been : ( i ) the restricted spatial resolution of ground - based data ; and ( ii ) lack of sufficiently general dynamical models to rule out constant mass - to - light ratio models beyond doubt .",
    "the hst now provides spectra of superior spatial resolution . to fully exploit the potential of these new data it is imperative to improve the modeling techniques that have been used in the past decade",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated than for gas disks in ( active ) galaxies , where the assumption of simple circular orbits is often adequate .",
    "interpretation of stellar kinematical data for flattened elliptical galaxies ideally requires axisymmetric ( or even better , triaxial ) dynamical models with completely general three - integral distribution functions .",
    "such models have not previously been constructed for any stellar kinematical bh candidate galaxy .",
    "we therefore developed a technique for the construction of such axisymmetric models , and used it to interpret our hst data for m32 .    to guide the construction and interpretation of the three - integral models we first compared the new hst data to the predictions of @xmath0 models , which have been used extensively to interpret ground - based m32 data .",
    "such models have the advantage that the df can be calculated semi - analytically , but have the disadvantage of having a special dynamical structure , with @xmath225 everywhere .",
    "there is no a priori reason why any galaxy should have this property .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath0 models fit the observed vp shapes inferred from ground - based data to within @xmath226% ( in terms of deviations from a gaussian ) , suggested that the m32 df might in fact be close to the form @xmath0 .",
    "we find here that @xmath0 models for m32 can also fit the new hst data , and that this requires the presence of a nuclear dark mass , as was the case for the ground - based data .",
    "however , the best fitting dark mass of @xmath227@xmath228 is larger than the @xmath229@xmath230 that best fits the @xmath231 spatial resolution data from the cfht , and is even more different from the @xmath232@xmath233 that best - fits the @xmath234 spatial resolution data from the wht .",
    "thus , under the assumption of an @xmath0 df , the different data sets can not be fit with the same @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the m32 df is not of the form @xmath0 , although it might be close to it .    to obtain a model - independent estimate of the best - fitting @xmath8 , and to firmly rule out models without any dark mass ,",
    "it is necessary to study more general three - integral models .",
    "we have made such models for m32 , both with and without central bhs , and for various possible values of the average mass - to - light ratio @xmath29 of the stellar population .",
    "the models were constructed to fit all available kinematical hst , cfht and wht data , and the acceptability of each model was assessed through the @xmath24 of its fit to the data .",
    "the models demonstrate explicitly for the first time that there is no axisymmetric constant mass - to - light ratio model that can fit the kinematical data without invoking the presence of a nuclear dark mass , independent of the dynamical structure of m32 .",
    "a nuclear dark point mass of @xmath235 is required ( with @xmath4 and @xmath5 error bars of @xmath6 and @xmath236 , respectively , which includes the possible effect of small numerical errors in the models ) .",
    "this mass is similar to that quoted by most previous papers , but the confidence on the detection of a nuclear dark mass in m32 is now much higher .",
    "constant mass - to - light ratio models still come very close to fitting the ground - based data , and only the new hst data make the case for a nuclear dark mass clear - cut .",
    "the inclination of m32 can not be inferred from the available surface photometry , and is therefore a free parameter in the modeling .",
    "ideally one would like to construct dynamical models for all possible inclinations ( which would be very computer - intensive ) and determine the inclination that best fits the kinematical data .",
    "here we have taken the more modest approach of constructing models for only two representative inclinations : @xmath1 ( edge - on ) and @xmath2 .",
    "the intrinsic axial ratios for these inclinations are @xmath79 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the three - integral @xmath2 models provide a better fit than the edge - on models , which suggests that m32 is not seen edge - on .",
    "however , the allowed range for @xmath8 does not depend sensitively on the assumed inclination : models with no central dark mass are firmly ruled out for both inclinations .",
    "so even though a more detailed study of the full inclination range for m32 would improve our knowledge of the true inclination and intrinsic axial ratio of m32 , it would probably not change significantly the constraints on the central dark mass .",
    "the best - fitting three - integral models are similar to @xmath0 models in that they have an excess of azimuthal motion .",
    "this is why they have been so successful in fitting ground - based data , including available vp shape parameters , and it confirms that they provide a useful low - order approximation to the dynamical structure of m32 .",
    "however , @xmath0 models do have @xmath237 .",
    "this does not reproduce the inequality between @xmath238 and @xmath239 , nor the modest tilt of the velocity ellipsoid indicated by the small @xmath195 term , seen in the best - fitting three - integral models .",
    "this is why @xmath0 models can not successfully explain _ all _ observed features of the kinematical data .    to constrain the size of the dark object in m32",
    "we have constructed @xmath0 models with an extended dark nuclear object .",
    "these show that the hst data put an upper limit of @xmath240 on the half - mass radius of the nuclear dark object , implying a central density exceeding @xmath11 .",
    "this limit on the density of dark material in m32 essentially rules out nuclear clusters of planets , brown dwarfs , white dwarfs , neutron stars , or smaller mass bhs ( van der marel 1997a ) .",
    "the absence of color gradients in the central arcsec of m32 implies that the nuclear mass concentration can also not be attributed to a stellar population gradient .",
    "a single massive nuclear bh therefore provides the most plausible interpretation of the data .",
    "axisymmetric dynamical models with a nuclear bh provide an excellent fit to all available kinematical data for m32 .",
    "however , to be physically meaningful , the models must also be dynamically stable . in van der marel , sigurdsson & hernquist ( 1997c ) we presented n - body simulations of the @xmath0 models for m32 .",
    "the models were found to be completely stable , both for @xmath1 and for @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that dynamical stability is not a problem for the models , and that the inclination of m32 can not be meaningfully constrained through stability arguments .",
    "we have not evolved n - body models for the best - fitting three - integral models , but we expect these models to be stable as well , given their similarity to @xmath0 models .",
    "the two - body relaxation time in m32 can be estimated as in , e.g. , binney & tremaine ( 1987 ; eq .  [ 8 - 71 ] ) .",
    "using the relevant quantities for our best - fitting dynamical model , we find for solar mass stars in the central cusp ( @xmath241 ) that @xmath242 .",
    "the time scale for ` resonant relaxation ' ( rauch & tremaine 1996 ) is of the same order .",
    "the central cusp must therefore be evolving secularly over a hubble time .",
    "however , the diffusion of stars in phase space is slow enough that one may assume the evolution to be through a sequence of quasi - equilibrium models .",
    "this justifies our approach of modeling m32 as a collisionless equilibrium system .",
    "studies of the secular evolution of the m32 cusp will be interesting , but will not change the need for a nuclear dark object .",
    "in fact , the process of dynamical relaxation supports the presence of a dark object : without a dark object the relaxation would proceed at a much more rapid rate that is difficult to reconcile with observations ( lauer 1992 ) .",
    "one remaining uncertainty in our dynamical modeling is the possibility of triaxiality .",
    "after the step from spherical models to axisymmetric models , triaxial models are the obvious next step .",
    "however , there are several reasons to believe that for m32 this additional step will be less important .",
    "first , m32 is known not to be spherical , but there is no reason why it can not be axisymmetric .",
    "there is no significant isophote twisting in m32 , and no minor axis rotation .",
    "this does not mean that m32 can not be triaxial ( we might be observing it from one of the principal planes ) , but it also does not mean that m32 needs to be triaxial .",
    "second , spherical constant mass - to - light ratio models ( without a nuclear dark mass ) for ground - based m32 data failed to fit by only a few @xmath243 , and it was quite conceivable that axisymmetry could fix this ( which it did , cf .  figure  [ f : drfit ] below ) .",
    "however , axisymmetric constant mass - to - light ratio models for the new hst data fail to fit the nuclear velocity dispersion by @xmath244 km / s , and this can not likely be fixed through triaxiality .",
    "third , theoretical arguments suggest that strongly triaxial models with density cusps as steep as in m32 may not be stable , owing to the fact that regular box - orbits are replaced by boxlets and irregular orbits that may not be able to sustain a triaxial shape ( binney & gerhard 1985 ; merritt & fridman 1996 ; merritt & valluri 1996 ; see also the review by de zeeuw 1996 ) .",
    "rapidly - rotating low - luminosity elliptical galaxies like m32 always have steep power - law cusps ( faber 1997 ) , and may therefore be axisymmetric as a class ( de zeeuw & carollo 1996 ) .",
    "this is consistent with statistical studies of their intrinsic shapes ( e.g. , merritt & tremblay 1996 ) .",
    "so , apart from the fact that triaxiality is unlikely to remove the need for a central dark object in m32 , it may even be so that m32 can not be significantly triaxial .",
    "the growth of a black hole into a stellar system is adiabatic if it occurs over a time scale that is ` long ' ( see sigurdsson , quinlan , & hernquist 1995 for a quantitative discussion ) compared to the typical orbital period of the stars . for the case of m32",
    ", the black hole formation can be considered adiabatic if it took at least @xmath12 .",
    "young ( 1980 ) studied the adiabatic growth of bhs in spherical isothermal models with central density @xmath245 and core radius @xmath246 .",
    "the bh growth leaves the mass density at large radii unchanged , but induces a central cusp @xmath247 for @xmath248 .",
    "the form of the density profile at intermediate radii is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath249 $ ] , which measures the ratio of the bh mass to the initial core mass .",
    "lauer ( 1992 ) showed that the shape of the m32 brightness profile measured with hst can be well fit with @xmath250 .",
    "the radial and density normalization implied by the data are then @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "photometric _ model therefore implies that @xmath253 . although this result depends somewhat on the assumed isothermality of the initial distribution ( quinlan , hernquist & sigurdsson 1995 ) , it is quite remarkable that our best - fitting _ dynamical _ models have exactly @xmath254 , for both inclinations that we studied .",
    "the m32 data are therefore fully consistent with the presence of a bh that grew adiabatically into a pre - existing core .",
    "this is similar to the situation for m87 ( cf .",

    "for the value of @xmath255 implied by the photometry , their models predict a profile of @xmath256 that is approximately flat with radius ( with amplitude fixed by the axial ratio of the system ) . however , this result depends very sensitively on the assumed rotation law of the initial model .",
    "the radial variations in @xmath257 seen in our best - fitting models ( figure  [ f : vsig ] ) are probably equally consistent with the adiabatic growth hypothesis .",
    "a star of mass @xmath258 and radius @xmath259 on a circular orbit of radius @xmath260 will be tidally disrupted if @xmath261 ( e.g. , binney & petit 1988 ) .",
    "thus , disruption of a solar type star by the bh in m32 will occur inside @xmath262 arcsec",
    ". a disruption event will be highly luminous , but is not predicted to occur more often than once every @xmath263 ( rees 1988 ) .",

    "do not constrain variations in the df over such a small range in @xmath121 , and our dynamical models therefore can not address the existence and properties of the so - called ` loss cone ' ( frank & rees 1976 ; lightman & shapiro 1977 ) . for the @xmath121-grid",
    "that we have employed , all solar type stars on orbits with @xmath270 have @xmath271 .",
    "even giants with @xmath272 have @xmath273 .",
    "this justifies our neglect of tidal disruption in the orbit calculations .",
    "an interesting question is why bhs in quiescent galaxies are nt more luminous ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . for m32 ,",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is @xmath274 ( eskridge , white & davis 1996 ) , the far infrared luminosity is @xmath275 ( knapp 1989 ) , and for the @xmath276 radio emission @xmath277 ( roberts 1991 ) .",
    "part or all of the observed x - ray emission may be due to low - mass x - ray binaries , so the total luminosity due to accretion onto the bh in m32 is @xmath278 . by contrast",
    ", the eddington luminosity of the bh is @xmath279 . for a canonical mass - loss rate of @xmath280 ( faber & gallagher 1976 ) ,",
    "the stars that are bound to the bh in m32 shed @xmath281 of gas as a result of normal stellar evolution .",
    "if a fraction @xmath282 of this gas is steadily accreted with efficiency @xmath201 , it produces a luminosity @xmath283 .",
    "thus either the accretion fraction @xmath282 or the accretion efficiency @xmath201 must be very small in m32 .",
    "thin disk accretion with @xmath284 requires @xmath285 , which is possible ( the accretion fraction is difficult to predict theoretically , because it depends on the hydrodynamics of the stellar winds that shed the gas ) , but may be implausibly low .",
    "instead , it appears more likely that @xmath201 is small , since there is a family of ` advection dominated ' accretion solutions that naturally predict such low efficiencies .",
    "models of this type successfully explain the ` micro - activity ' of the bh ( sgr a@xmath286 ) in our own galaxy ( narayan , yi & mahadevan 1995 ) . in a typical accretion model of this type ( narayan & yi 1995 , their fig .",

    "future observations of m32 will include spectra with the new long - slit hst spectrograph stis .",
    "these will provide significantly better sky coverage than our fos data , but the spatial resolution will be similar .",
    "the high - resolution hst data can be complemented with that from fully two - dimensional ground - based spectrographs , such as oasis on the cfht and sauron on the wht .",
    "these combined data will yield improved constraints on the bh mass , on the orbital structure and inclination of m32 , and on possible deviations from axisymmetry .",

    "in this appendix we discuss the topology of the @xmath152 contours for the edge - on orbit - superposition models .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ f : subdatachi ] show the @xmath24 contours when only ( subsets of ) the ground - based wht data are included in the fit .",
    "these panels can be compared to figure  [ f : subdatachi]d , which shows the contours for the case in which all wht , cfht and hst data are included .",
    "figure  [ f : subdatachi]a shows the @xmath24 contours when only the major axis @xmath289 and @xmath290 wht measurements are fit .",
    "binney & mamon ( 1982 ) showed that a large range of gravitational potentials can fit any given observed velocity dispersion profile .",
    "the valley seen in the @xmath24 contours is a consequence of this : it outlines a one - parameter family of models that can fit the data with different velocity dispersion anisotropy . for",
    "a non - rotating spherical system , only models that require negative second velocity moments are ruled out . for a rotating system like m32 , the observed rotation rate sets additional limits on the allowed radial anisotropy .",
    "for the case of the major axis @xmath289 and @xmath290 wht measurements , a no - bh model is just marginally acceptable at @xmath169 per cent confidence , cf .  figure  [ f : subdatachi]a . for the lower - spatial resolution",
    "major axis @xmath289 and @xmath290 measurements of dressler & richstone ( 1988 ) such a model is entirely acceptable .",
    "figure  [ f : drfit ] compares the predictions of the best - fit axisymmetric orbit - superposition model without a bh to their data .",
    "richstone , bower & dressler ( 1990 ) concluded that these data could not be fit by any _ spherical _",
    "model without a bh .",
    "this is because spherical models allow less rotation , and therefore failed to fit the observed rotation velocities .",
    "this underscores the importance of making axisymmetric models for flattened galaxies like m32 .",
    "vp shape measurements provide independent constraints on the velocity dispersion anisotropy .",
    "figure  [ f : subdatachi]b shows the @xmath24 contours for edge - on orbit - superposition models when not only the wht major axis @xmath289 and @xmath290 measurements are fit , but also the major axis vp shape measurements . with the inclusion of the vp shapes , models without a bh",
    "are ruled out .",
    "figure  [ f : subdatachi]c shows the @xmath24 contours when also the wht measurements along other position angles are included , which contracts the allowed @xmath8 range to @xmath291@xmath292 at the formal @xmath169 per cent confidence level .",
    "the wht data by themselves therefore rule out axisymmetric models without a bh .",
    "however , the models without a bh still come very close to fitting the data , and , e.g. , fail to fit the central velocity dispersion by only 12@xmath243 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : datafitsatoh ] ) .",
    "so one can not make a particularly strong claim for a bh on the basis of the wht data alone , because it is conceivable that the fit could be improved with , e.g. , only a minor amount of triaxiality .",
    "the same holds for the cfht data , but the new hst data do make the case for a bh in m32 clear - cut .",
    "the contours for the case in which all the available wht , cfht and hst kinematical data are included in the fit ( figure  [ f : subdatachi]d ) show one global @xmath24 minimum , and a second local minimum .",
    "the presence of a global minimum does not necessarily imply that the combined data constrain a single best - fit potential .",
    "it might be that there is a small range of potentials that all fit equally well , but that such a range of constant @xmath24 would not be evident due to the finite numerical accuracy of our technique . in figure",
    "[ f : subdatachi]e we show explicitly how the topology of the @xmath24 contours might have been influenced by the possibility of small numerical errors in our models . it was obtained from figure  [ f : subdatachi]d by recalculating the @xmath24 contours after adding a random error @xmath293 $ ] km / s and @xmath294 $ ] ( cf .  section  [ s : technique ] ) to the prediction for each data point , for each @xmath150 combination .",
    "the results show that numerical errors can indeed influence the @xmath24 contours near the @xmath24 minimum .",
    "thus , the second minimum in figure  [ f : subdatachi]d might be the result of numerical inaccuracies in our technique .",
    "however , the numerical errors are small enough that they only have a negligible effect on the overall @xmath24 topology .",
    "in particular , models without a dark mass remain firmly ruled out .",
    "to assess the possible effect of numerical errors on the confidence bands for @xmath8 , we constructed 100 figures like figure  [ f : subdatachi]e using different random realizations .",
    "for each we determined the position of the @xmath24 minimum , and the minimum and maximum @xmath8 for which there is an @xmath29 such that the model with @xmath199 falls within the @xmath169 per cent confidence region .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ f : subdatachi]f .",
    "all allowed @xmath8 values fall in the range @xmath295@xmath296 .",
    "thus , @xmath297 at @xmath169 per cent confidence .",
    "similar experiments show that @xmath298 at @xmath164 per cent confidence .",
    "experiments for @xmath2 produced similar results , and mass ranges that were either the same or slightly smaller .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 errors on the estimated @xmath299 , are @xmath300 and @xmath236 , respectively ."
