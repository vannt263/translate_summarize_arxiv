    "a significant challenge in astronomy today is understanding the relationships between very distant galaxies and nearby galaxies .",
    "recent observations have identified many luminous , high - redshift systems , yet they are faint and very difficult to study in detail . are there good local counterparts for these galaxies ?",
    "if so , we may try and use the local counterparts to better understand their distant relatives .",
    "new observations , carried out primarily with the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba : holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope , have revealed the presence of a significant population of far - ir ( fir ) luminous galaxies , most likely at redshifts @xmath5 (  sub - mm galaxies , \" e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1998 , barger et al .",
    "these galaxies are apparently responsible for much of the fir and sub - mm extragalactic background radiation , whose energy density is comparable to that of the integrated optical light of faint galaxies seen in , e.g. , the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) ( e.g. , hauser et al .",
    "1998 ; barger , cowie & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "the sub - mm galaxies detected to date are much more luminous than almost any galaxy in the local universe .",
    "it is possible that a significant fraction of the star formation in the early universe occurred in fir - luminous galaxies , of which the current sample of sub - mm galaxies are the most luminous . at present , it is not clear if the sub - mm galaxies are at all related to galaxies at similar redshifts discovered by the lyman break technique , even though the brightest , reddest lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) may have comparable bolometric luminosities , after reddening is taken into account @xcite .",
    "most ( but not all ) sub - mm galaxies are too faint and/or red to be found with lbg selection criteria .    for the sub - mm galaxies with known redshifts , the bluest sub - mm observations ( at , e.g. , 450 ) still fall on the rayleigh - jeans side of the rest - frame fir peak wavelengths .",
    "nonetheless , the limited information on these sub - mm galaxies shows that they appear to have overall rest - frame fir / radio spectral energy distributions quite similar to those of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies discovered in the local universe ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this has led to increased interest in the nearby infrared galaxies as possible counterparts .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies , computed using the prescription in that paper . ]",
    "( uligs , with @xmath7 ) were found to be a significant class of objects upon analysis of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of uligs , the most powerful infrared - luminous galaxies , are similar to those of optically - selected quasars .",
    "we now understand uligs to be a stage in the merger of two gas - rich spiral galaxies . during the merger ,",
    "the molecular gas is driven inward towards the nuclei , where the gas serves to fuel a tremendous burst of star formation and , perhaps , agn activity as well .",
    "dust absorbs and re - radiates the light from young stars and/or the agn . complicating our understanding of uligs is the fact that most of the energetic activity takes place in the inner few hundred pc , where small angular sizes and almost entirely opaque ism prevent us from directly witnessing events occurring in the nuclei themselves .    the primary goal of our study is to explore the possible connection between sub - mm galaxies and uligs .",
    "there is substantial circumstantial evidence linking uligs and sub - mm galaxies , but a direct connection has not been established . in part , this is because of observational considerations . the fir / radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the best - studied sub - mm galaxies ( ero j164502 + 4626.4 : dey et al . 1999 ; smm j023990136 : ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; smm j14011 + 0252 : ivison et al .",
    "2000 ; and smm j023990134 : barger et al .",
    "1999a ) are sampled redward of the rest - frame fir peak , which should occur at 60100  if their dust temperatures are similar to those of the uligs .",
    "optical and near - ir observations sample blueward of @xmath30.6  in the rest - frame for @xmath8 . as a result , we know little or nothing of the properties of sub - mm galaxies from the red optical through @xmath3200  in the rest - frame . and",
    "unfortunately , local uligs are poorly studied shortward of @xmath34000  .",
    "what morphological comparisons we can make using , e.g. , optical images , are quite limited . as a result",
    ", the strongest links between uligs and sub - mm galaxies are made largely on the basis of three facts .",
    "first , uligs and sub - mm galaxies are the most highly luminous systems in the far - ir in the local universe and at @xmath9 respectively , although most sub - mm galaxies detected so far are inferred to be still a factor of few more luminous than uligs such as arp 220 ( barger , cowie &  richards 2000 ) .",
    "second , uligs and sub - mm galaxies also have similar far - ir / sub - mm / radio seds .",
    "finally , large amounts of molecular gas ( e.g. , co ) have been detected in both classes of objects .",
    "local counterparts , even when not exact matches , can offer important insights on high-_z _ systems .",
    "for example , starbursts observed with iue ( e.g. , meurer et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) have seds and uv spectral properties like lbgs , though the local galaxies are smaller and less luminous ; this has been used to infer that the basic physics ( e.g. , winds , reddening ) of these objects are similar .",
    "we hope that observations of uligs in the rest - frame uv , telling us about their morphologies , luminosities , and colors , might both allow a test of their fitness as counterparts of sub - mm galaxies , and also allow us to better interpret the rest - frame uv observations of sub - mm galaxies .",
    "a secondary goal is to test whether uligs follow what is known as the  irx-@xmath10 \" correlation between the redness of the uv continuum ( parameterized by the uv spectral slope @xmath10 between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) and the ir - excess ( the irx , defined as the ratio of the fir / uv fluxes in the fuv channel , where @xmath14 is the observed flux density in erg/@xmath15/s/@xmath16 . ] ) , that has been established for a sample of local starbursts observed in the uv @xcite .",
    "the correlation is well fit by a foreground dust shell model , wherein dust surrounding the uv - bright region both reddens and absorbs the uv light , reprocessing it to fir wavelengths .",
    "the correlation appears to hold for @xmath17 , but has not been tested at higher luminosities .",
    "if uligs also follow this correlation , then we would have more confidence that rest - frame uv observations of even the most dusty high-@xmath18 star - forming galaxies can be used to estimate their total bolometric luminosities ( dominated by the difficult to access far - infrared ) ensuring that these galaxies are included in the census of star formation in the early universe .",
    "we know that @xmath10 and the irx correlate with total luminosity for the meurer et al .",
    "sample @xcite .",
    "if these trends hold at higher @xmath19 and higher @xmath18 , then sub - mm galaxies may be too red to be selected as lbgs , and may perhaps better be associated with extremely red objects ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2000 , apj , 542 , 27 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present new rest - frame uv observations of seven galaxies with @xmath20 .",
    "three uligs ( vii zw 31 , iras 12112 + 0305 , and iras 224911808 ) were detected in the uv using the faint object camera on the pre - costar hubble space telescope ( hst ) by trentham , kormendy , & sanders ( 1999 , hereafter tks ) . though their photometric precision was limited by the spherical aberration and high backgrounds , the detections were good evidence that our program was in fact feasible .",
    "more recently , ground - based images in the @xmath21 band ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) were obtained for many uligs ( including three of our galaxies , iras 08572 + 3915 , mrk 273 , and iras 15250 + 3609 , plus two galaxies , iras 12112 + 0305 and iras 224911808 , from tks ) by @xcite .",
    "this paper concentrates on the large - scale photometric and morphological properties for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we will first describe the observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "then , we comment on the uv photometric properties of the galaxies ( e.g. , irx-@xmath10 ) .",
    "we give detailed descriptions of each system , then discuss their detectability at high-@xmath18 .",
    "finally , we consider our systems in relation to lyman - break galaxies , extremely red objects , and sub - mm galaxies . here",
    ", we assume a hubble constant of @xmath24 km / s / mpc , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "computing angular size and luminosity distances in a cosmology with nonzero @xmath27 is described by @xcite .",
    "we constructed a flux- and luminosity - limited sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs : @xmath28 ) and uligs from the iras bright galaxy sample , then selected from that list seven relatively nearby galaxies that had already been imaged at other wavelengths by hst .",
    "our sample spans a factor of 4 in ir luminosity , including 2 ligs at the highest luminosities of the starbursts studied in the papers by meurer et al . , @xmath29 , and 5 uligs , going up to @xmath30 ( listed in order of increasing right ascension in table 1 ) .",
    "we obtained our far- and near - uv images using the mama detectors of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on hst . in the near - uv channel ( stis nuv - mama+f25qtz filter , @xmath31 , @xmath32  fwhm ) , we obtained two exposures totalling 1500 seconds , with the telescope offset by 024 in ra and dec between exposures .",
    "the far - uv observations ( stis fuv - mama+f25srf2 filter , @xmath33 , @xmath34 fwhm ) , were divided into 2 - 3 similarly offset pairs of images , for far - uv exposure times of 28293891 seconds .",
    "details of the exposures are given in table 2 .",
    "we analyzed the stsci pipeline - processed stis data as follows .",
    "first , we split the paired far - uv images into single ones , giving typically six far - uv images and two near - uv images per galaxy . for each individual image , we determined and subtracted the mean values of the sky found from large regions well away from detectable galaxy emission .",
    "the far - uv background was found to vary significantly in some cases , due to light near the limb of the earth . because the extended emission from our sources is typically 12 dn per pixel , a few images with high backgrounds ( @xmath35 dn per pixel )",
    "were rejected , because the s / n ratios of the combined images would have been limited by the poisson noise of the high - sky images .",
    "the images were aligned and co - added using the drizzle package in iraf ( v2.10 ) , with which we also corrected the geometric distortion ( using the cubic distortion coefficients from the stis instrument handbook , version 3 , june , 1999 ) and rotated the images to the standard north - up , east - left orientation .",
    "we also magnified the far - uv images to the same platescale as the near - uv images ( 0024465/pixel ) during the drizzle process .",
    "for the stis images , determining accurate sky values was important because much of the total uv flux comes from large regions with surface brightnesses near the residual sky levels .",
    "the uncertainty in our photometry is therefore quite sensitive to accurate subtraction of the residual sky levels .",
    "we measured the sky counts in the darkest regions of the images , in a few contiguous groups of 20@xmath3620 pixel boxes , about 3040 boxes in total for each final uv image .",
    "we determined the residual sky levels for each of the final images from the averages of the means of the sky counts in the boxes , and the uncertainties in the residual sky levels were set to the @xmath37 scatter in the means of the sky counts of the boxes .",
    "one galaxy , arp 220 , was especially problematic , because its large angular size resulted in faint emission essentially filling the entire stis field of view . for arp 220",
    ", the darkest regions of the uv images turned out to be located within the dark dust lanes apparent in optical images.0.1 dn / pixel .",
    "the fuv sky means , in large sections of the raw uv images , varied from 0.004 dn / pixel to 0.68 dn / pixel from image to image .",
    "the variation was due to scattered light from near earth s limb in the images .",
    "so , the highest the true fuv ( sky+galaxy ) value could have been was 0.004 dn / pixel , in an exposure of 690 seconds .",
    "any extended emission from the galaxy can have at most that much flux .",
    "after combining the fuv images with those sky values subtracted , the final value of the fuv ",
    "residual \" sky was @xmath38 from zero .",
    "our error estimates should adequately incorporate the possibility of errors in the sky determination .",
    "in short , the extremely low counts in dark areas of the raw arp 220 uv images lead us to believe that we are not losing significant amounts of uniform , extended light across the images . ] in all other galaxies , comparison with wfpc2 ( or nicmos ) images show that the stis field of view was large enough that we should have regions of blank sky in our stis images , and those regions with lowest counts were used to determine the sky levels .",
    "measuring total fluxes is difficult because the objects have irregular shapes , and in several cases their surface brightnesses barely ever reach above the sky level over much of the face of the galaxy .",
    "we developed a `` buffered isophote '' technique for measuring total fluxes .",
    "first , we used the adaptive smoothing algorithm of scoville et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to make a smoothed fuv image of each galaxy .",
    "this was used to make a  good pixel \" mask of all pixels in the smoothed image that are @xmath39 above the background , where @xmath40 is the scatter about the mean background as described above .",
    "it is important to use the smoothed image for this so that the fluxes are not biased upwards by positive noise deviations .",
    "since the light distribution undoubtedly extends beyond the @xmath41 isophote , we then buffered this mask by appending all pixels within 1@xmath42 of the previously marked pixels as also being  good . \"",
    "the choice of 1@xmath42 as the buffer size is somewhat arbitrary , but by blinking the mask and the smoothed images it was clear that there is little or no real structure beyond the mask . the total flux is then found by adding the flux in the  good \" pixels of _ the original images _ ( before smoothing ) .",
    "both the fuv and nuv fluxes were extracted with the fuv mask .",
    "using the nuv image to create the mask often resulted in slightly larger fluxes , but the differences were within the photometric errors .",
    "we also performed simple circular aperture photometry in apertures of 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 kpc physical radius in our assumed cosmology ( table 3 ) .",
    "we note that the larger apertures can include flux from companion or field galaxies in some cases .",
    "errors were determined from photon statistics and the uncertainties in the sky levels ( the latter dominates in all cases ) . in all but one case ( iras 192547245 ) , at least 85% of the  total \" flux",
    "is contained within the 5 kpc radius aperture ( or the sum of the two apertures for iras 08572 + 3915 and vv 114 ) .",
    "we note that photometry of iras 192547245 in large apertures is intrinsically uncertain at the level of 0.260.46 magnitudes because of the very low flux levels , and some of the  missed \" flux likely comes from a few star clusters outside the 5 kpc apertures .",
    "wfpc2 images of the five of our galaxies with @xmath7 had been taken , and we retrieved those from the hst archive .",
    "we co - added the pipeline - calibrated images , using crrej and cosmicrays to correct for cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "we then used drizzle to perform the geometric corrections , adjust the pixel scale to that of the stis images , and rotate the images to the standard north - up orientation .",
    "nicmos images of all but one of our galaxies ( iras 192547245 ) were taken and made available in reduced form by @xcite .",
    "we used magnify and rotate to set the pixel scale and orientation to those of the stis images . in all cases ,",
    "there were enough common details between the uv and optical , and near - ir and optical , that we could confidently co - register the multi - wavelength data relative to the wfpc2 images using imshift .",
    "( for the two galaxies without wfpc2 images , vv 114 and ic 883 , we aligned the uv and ir images relative to the f110w and f160w images . )",
    "we estimate registration uncertainties of @xmath43 1 stis pixel .",
    "as noted in section 1 , @xcite ( hereafter m99 ) describe an empirical relationship between the color of the uv continuum ( parameterized by @xmath10 ) and the fir / uv flux ratio for a sample of starbursts observed with iue  the irx-@xmath10 correlation .",
    "the fir emission results from dust heated by the uv photons it absorbs .",
    "hence , for galaxies obeying this correlation , one can use @xmath10 to predict the fir / uv flux ratio , and hence recover the dust - absorbed uv emission .",
    "this can be especially useful at high redshift , where access to the rest - frame fir is currently very difficult .",
    "one problem with this method is the heterogeneous nature of the calibrating iue galaxy sample .",
    "it is not yet clear how well this calibration works for fir - selected ( e.g. iras ) galaxies",
    ". we can now begin to address this issue for the most luminous iras galaxies .",
    "we have calculated the global values of @xmath10 and the irx for our uligs ( see appendix ) after first correcting for galactic extinction using the values in table 1 . and for the galaxies studied by tks using the fluxes in that paper .",
    "the values for our uligs are given in table 3 .",
    "we plot @xmath10 and the irx in different apertures in figs .",
    "[ global_betairx ] and [ nuclear_betairx ] .",
    "the key result is that most of our ligs and uligs do not obey the irx-@xmath10 correlation , irrespective of aperture size .",
    "the sense of this is that in most cases , our galaxies have much higher ir - excesses for their uv colors than m99 s galaxies . in the absence of the fir data , using the m99 correlation would lead us to greatly underestimate the fir fluxes of most of our galaxies .",
    "one might have hoped that if the bluer light from star - forming regions far from the nuclei were ignored , the light from the nuclei themselves might follow the irx-@xmath10 correlation , but this is not the case . the discrepancy between our galaxies and the m99 sample gets much worse as we decrease the aperture sizes and split the fir fluxes between members of interacting pairs ( fig .",
    "[ nuclear_betairx ] ) . by far the worse failure is arp 220 , where using the 2 kpc diameter aperture would have us underestimating the fir flux by a factor of @xmath44 . while the uv colors are indeed redder in the smaller apertures , the uv fluxes themselves drop off as well . on the other hand , vv 114",
    ", the second least luminous system in our sample , comes the closest to obeying the irx-@xmath10 correlation , falling within the scatter of iue starbursts .",
    "vv 114 is composed of uv - bright and uv - faint components , and it is the former that is similar to m99 s starbursts .",
    "( it is possible that the nucleus of iras 19254 - 7245 s is consistent with irx-@xmath10 , since we only have a lower limit for @xmath10 . )",
    "one possible interpretation of the above two results is that the ir - luminous regions of the galaxies are so obscured that we have detected no uv light from them at all . in this case",
    ", the uv light we do see comes from relatively lightly - reddened star - forming regions and stars outside the most obscured regions , giving blue colors .",
    "we would then expect the irx to be essentially uncorrelated with color , as is observed .",
    "inspection of table 3 shows that only on order of a few percent of the total nuv flux arises from the inner 0.5 kpc radius ( from 0.07% for vv 114 e to 7.3% for iras 15250 + 3609 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the central , intrinsically luminous regions being hidden from view .",
    "this is the expectation of radiative transfer models where stars and dust are mixed , such as the `` dusty '' model with smc type dust of @xcite ; see their fig .  12 .",
    "however , for a given geometry , the witt & gordon models can not explain both the range of the irx-@xmath10 correlation seen in m99 s starbursts ( which seems to require foreground dust ) and the position of the ligs and uligs ( which does not ) .",
    "either the relative distribution of dust and stars is different between the iue starbursts and our sample , or a more complicated dust geometry than that explored by witt &  gordon is required .",
    "this picture has important implications if uligs are in fact the analogues of the sub - mm galaxies .",
    "we should not expect optical spectroscopy of the sub - mm sources , probing the rest - frame vacuum uv , to be sensitive to the dominant luminosity source in the inner few hundred pc of the galaxies . in some cases",
    ", an agn may be seen through a hole in the obscuring gas and dust ; but the absence of an agn spectrum is not sufficient to rule out the possibility of a buried agn .",
    "sub - mm line and continuum observations of uligs have shown that they contain tremendous concentrations of gas and dust in their nuclei @xcite .",
    "commonly , @xmath45 of gas are located in the inner kpc of uligs .",
    "the highest spatial resolution observations show the existence of what @xcite called  extreme starburst regions , \" wherein @xmath46 of h@xmath47 gas is concentrated in regions typically 100 pc in size .",
    "the resulting beam - averaged surface densities of dust ( assuming reasonable gas / dust ratios and spherical symmetry ) are so high as to give extinctions of up to @xmath48 magnitudes @xmath49 in the inner few hundred pc .",
    "this simple model , which requires @xmath50 magnitudes , can not apply to all parts of the nuclear regions in the uligs , since bright near - ir emission is in fact seen from the nuclear regions of all uligs ( e.g. , scoville et al . 2000 ) .",
    "further , we see uv emission concentrated towards the inner few hundred pc in some of the galaxies , even though the compact nuclear sources are usually not well detected in our images . an alternate picture , as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "might be a compact , totally obscured ( in the uv , near - ir , and even mid - ir ) core ( the extreme starburst regions ) with still dense , yet not entirely opaque ( in the near - ir ) mixed gas / dust clouds on the exterior ( the surrounding  molecular disk \" ) .",
    "on the outside would be additional mixed gas / dust clouds and uv sources , possibly corresponding to  field \" star formation .",
    "this would allow us to see some relatively blue extended emission and star clusters outside the most obscured regions . if this is true , some of the uv light visible at the apparent ir nuclei would come from foreground stars seen in projection .",
    "@xcite suggested that lbgs and uligs / sub - mm galaxies are the extreme objects along an increasingly reddened sequence of starbursts .",
    "their paper marks the most detailed attempt yet to unify these apparently disparate objects .",
    "adelberger & steidel examined the seds of a sample of uligs in the mid - ir , fir , sub - mm , and radio .",
    "after computing an  average sed , \" they showed that one could predict the bolometric luminosity of a ulig from observations at any one of those wavelengths , with typical uncertainties of @xmath30.2 - 0.3 dex . among uligs",
    "; the sub - mm observations are in the rayleigh - jeans regime ; and the radio - fir correlation has a small dispersion . ]",
    "they then went further , showing that the admittedly few radio and mid - ir observations of @xmath51 galaxies are consistent with the irx-@xmath10 relation found for the m99 sample of local starbursts .",
    "the existence of ir - luminous galaxies at @xmath51 has been inferred from _ infrared space observatory _",
    "observations , particularly of the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "about 16 galaxies with @xmath51 were detected in the 15  images . at these redshifts ,",
    "the iso observations are sensitive to the broad , rest - frame polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features seen in local starbursts .",
    "adelberger & steidel showed that the fir luminosity of local uligs can be estimated to an accuracy of about 0.22 dex from the strength of these mid - ir features .",
    "if that relationship holds at @xmath51 , then the iso - detected galaxies would have fir luminosities like local uligs , but would have lower values of the irx , approximately following m99 s irx-@xmath10 relation .",
    "this is some suggestion that while uligs exist at @xmath51 , they might be different ( more transparent ) than local uligs .",
    "the irx-@xmath10 relation might hold at @xmath52 as well .",
    "rest - frame uv observations of two high-@xmath18 galaxies , ero j164502 + 4626.4 and smm j14011 + 0252 , are consistent , within errors , with those galaxies obeying the irx-@xmath10 relationship . finally",
    ", measurements of the ensemble fluxes ( at 850 and radio wavelengths ) of samples of @xmath4 lbgs show that these galaxies are at least not grossly inconsistent with irx-@xmath10 .",
    "the overall conclusion of adelberger & steidel is that observations at @xmath53 are all consistent with the existence of an irx-@xmath10-like relationship holding all the way to high redshifts .",
    "in addition , computing the total @xmath54 , adelberger & steidel show that galaxies with higher @xmath55 are more obscured ( that is , have a higher value of the irx ) than less bolometrically luminous galaxies .",
    "however , it also appears that the slope or zero - point of this relationship evolves with redshift , in that for a given star formation rate , galaxies are more transparent at @xmath56 than at @xmath57 .    to further complicate matters , there are some lbgs with fairly high luminosities ( @xmath58 ) that appear to have very little dust ( as determined by the absence of appreciable dust reddening ) .",
    "these objects will have relatively low fir luminosities if they obey the irx-@xmath10 correlation .",
    "the lbgs expected to have the highest bolometric luminosities have similar apparent uv magnitudes , but are much redder .",
    "they have predicted @xmath59 ( m99 ) , while the brightest sub - mm galaxies are estimated to be ten times more luminous .",
    "adelberger & steidel attempted to logically connect these lower - luminosity objects that are detectable in deep optical surveys , to the higher - luminosity dusty objects ( sub - mm galaxies are the most extreme examples ) that were present in the early universe , yet are not easily detected ( if at all ) with the same techniques .",
    "as noted earlier , the irx-@xmath10 relation at @xmath57 was determined by m99 from observations of a heterogeneous sample of fairly uv - bright starbursts .",
    "that sample was not preselected to contain galaxies with high @xmath60 , so it was not clear that ligs and uligs obeyed the irx-@xmath10 relationship .",
    "the hst observations of three uligs by tks were the first indication that uligs in fact deviated from irx-@xmath10 .",
    "our new observations confirm that clearly , for the uligs in our sample , irx-@xmath10 does not hold .",
    "the irx-@xmath10 relation appears to break down at @xmath61 .",
    "though @xcite showed that two sub - mm galaxies were consistent with irx-@xmath10 , this would not , in general , be the case if our uligs are good analogues to sub - mm galaxies .    one point , however , is that not all our galaxies fail irx-@xmath10 completely : the lig vv 114 in particular is not too far off .",
    "there are two galaxies in the m99 sample with @xmath62 .",
    "one , ngc 3256 , obeys irx-@xmath10 , while the other , ngc 1614 , is overbright in the fir . it would be interesting to observe more galaxies with @xmath63 to see if there is some particular value of @xmath60 where galaxies begin to move far off the irx-@xmath10 relationship .",
    "our sample is too limited to tell , as it contains only two galaxies in that luminosity range .",
    "we have referred to the breakdown of irx-@xmath10 primarily as a luminosity effect , but it may be that dust content and spatial distribution are more important . dust content and fir luminosity",
    "are correlated , so compared to low - luminosity starbursts , uligs have greater amounts of gas and dust available to both fuel and obscure the compact starbursts ( or agn ) that provide the high luminosities .",
    "additionally , in uligs , this gas and dust is centrally concentrated , usually in the inner kpc or less , resulting in immense optical depths .",
    "many of our galaxies evidence strong , nuclear activity not necessarily connected to star formation .",
    "detailed descriptions of each galaxy are given below , but of the galaxies in our sample , mrk 273 and the southern ( ir - dominant ) component of iras 192547245 have seyfert 2-type optical spectra ; the near- and mid - ir properties of vv 114 give evidence that an agn might be present in the eastern half of the system ; and iras 08572 + 3915 nw , ic 883 , iras 15250 + 3609 , and arp 220 have liner spectra .",
    "the connection between liner spectra and agn activity is still poorly understood ; a liner spectrum might be due to shock - excited gas associated with a starburst - induced  superwind , \" and have no relationship to ( black hole - inspired ) agn activity at all @xcite .",
    "the best evidence for  dominant \" agn ( i.e. , producing @xmath64 of the fir flux ) is probably in iras 08572 + 3915 nw and iras 19254 - 7245 s. on the other hand , the presence of strong starburst activity ( perhaps with a modest agn contribution ) seems well established in the other five galaxies in our sample .",
    "this is detailed below in  4.4 .",
    "how would the presence of an agn affect the irx-@xmath10 correlation ?",
    "the starburst fraction of the fir emission would decrease as the agn fraction increased . if we detect only the starburst in the uv , and if only the starburst fraction of the fir emission were counted , this would push the galaxy downward on the irx-@xmath10 plots , closer to the relationship found for the uv - selected starburst sample . as noted above",
    ", agn are likely to make a substantial contribution to the fir in only two cases .",
    "vv 114 falls on the irx-@xmath10 relationship , the other four likely to be starburst - dominated all fall far above .",
    "thus , a minor agn contribution to the fir is not capable of explaining the weak uv detections .",
    "vv 114 ( ic1623 , arp 236 ) was discovered to be a bright fir source in the original iras bright galaxy survey . at about 87 mpc distance",
    ", it is one of the more nearby galaxies with such a high fir luminosity .",
    "optical and near - ir imaging @xcite show a strong contrast between the two members of the merging pair that comprise vv114 .",
    "the western component ( vv 114 w ) is dominated by a blue , high surface brightness complex of regions with a relatively weak near - ir nucleus . the eastern component",
    "( vv 114 e ) is much redder and brighter in the near - ir , and contains two prominent , extended sources : a and b of doyon et al .",
    "only the brighter of these , source a , is apparent at 3.8 .",
    "the hst nicmos images of @xcite show that source a contains a bright , pointlike source that had been unresolved in the ground - based images .",
    "optical and near - ir spectra indicate that star formation dominates the energetics of vv 114 w , while both star formation and an agn may power vv114e . at 2.2 ,",
    "the latter shows a very red continuum with starburst features ( hei and br@xmath65 nebular emission lines and stellar co absorption bands ) superimposed @xcite .",
    "the near - ir spectrum of region a , can be modelled by a combination of about 50% highly reddened starlight ( @xmath66 mag , for @xmath67 mag ) , and about 50% hot dust ( @xmath68 ) which is consistent with the broad - band near - ir colors .",
    "the high hot dust fraction of the concentrated red emission in source a is very unusual in what otherwise seems to be a starburst @xcite .",
    "the 512 colors ( from the infrared space observatory , iso ) are also consistent with strong hot dust emission , leading @xcite to suggest that vv 114 e may get up to one - half of its mid - ir luminosity from an agn . maps of vv 114 e at 8.44 ghz @xcite show the multiple morphology seen at 2.2 , and the radio counterpart of source a contains several small sources . at lower resolution , radio maps @xcite show that 21 cm continuum radiation is widespread throughout the system with concentrations corresponding to both vv114w and e. sub - mm line and continuum maps @xcite show great amounts of molecular gas and dust are present in vv 114 , with morphology grossly similar to the 21 cm maps .",
    "much of the material detected in the sub - mm maps is located between vv 114 e and vv 114 w.    the two components of vv114 are probably nearly equal in total luminosity , although their overall seds are very different . using the 21 cm flux as a tracer of fir , @xcite suggest that the fir flux is split 60% from e , 40% from w. however , with this split , @xmath69 for the w component , which means that the fuv flux also contributes significantly to the bolometric luminosity . from starburst99 models @xcite we estimate a bolometric correction of @xmath70 for the stis fuv fluxes of star forming populations , . ]",
    "hence the detected fuv emission adds another @xmath71% to the bolometric flux of the w component .",
    "therefore in terms of bolometric luminosity , the split is about 45%  in the e and 55%  in the w components .",
    "the contrast betwen the two components is most extreme in our uv images ( figs .",

    "several hundred clusters are seen in vv 114 w , many visible all the way from the far - uv through near - ir .",
    "however , very little uv emission is detected from vv 114 e. no bright uv sources are seen in the near - ir bright regions of vv 114 e. no detectable uv sources are seen projected within @xmath72 pc of b , while two faint , fairly blue uv sources are seen projected about 100 pc from source a. the fairly blue colors of the clusters in vv 114 w , and the similarity of the uv and near - ir images of vv 114 w , suggest that dust absorption is not nearly as strong there as in vv 114 e.      iras 08572 + 3915 consists of an obviously interacting , yet still well - separated pair of galaxies .",

    "however , the two peaks do not appear to overlap precisely ; their position angles and separations are different in the radio and at 2.2 .",

    "in fact , this new spectrum is well matched by a combination of young , intermediate age , and old stellar populations , though potentially up to @xmath320% of the optical light could come from a power - law ( agn ? ) continuum . while the near - ir spectrum is that of a starburst @xcite , high - excitation lines signalling an agn are seen in the mid - ir @xcite .",

    "uligs are the only objects in the local universe ( @xmath118 ) with thermal fir emission even approaching that of the sub - mm galaxies .",
    "this makes uligs the most likely local counterparts of sub - mm galaxies  but is there a direct match ?",
    "in other words , are uligs the local ( low-@xmath19 , low-@xmath18 ) tail of the same class of objects we see as sub - mm galaxies at @xmath52 ? or are local uligs and sub - mm galaxies different kinds of objects , which both happen to have high fir luminosities ?",
    "first , we return to the fact that the current sample of sub - mm galaxies are intrinsically a few times more luminous than any local ulig .",
    "even the most luminous of our uligs , arp 220 , would have an observed 850  flux @xmath119 mjy at @xmath120 , and so it would not be present in the current lists of 3@xmath40 or 4@xmath40 scuba sources .",
    "the uncomfortable conclusion is that our uligs , if placed at @xmath52 , would be difficult or impossible to detect in either optical or sub - mm deep fields .",
    "one argument that local uligs are not like those at high redshift can be drawn from the work of @xcite discussed earlier .",
    "at @xmath52 , ir - luminous galaxies appear to be more transparent in the uv than local uligs .",
    "the reasons for this are not obvious .",
    "one possibility , shown directly in the sub - mm galaxy smm j14011 + 0252 galaxy ( and hinted at in others ) by @xcite , is that the ir - emitting regions in sub - mm galaxies are much more extended than in local uligs .",
    "this would naturally lead to a greater chance for  holes \" in the obscuration from which uv light could escape .",
    "one way to see if uligs and sub - mm galaxies are the same kinds of object is to ask the question : do the rest - frame uv / optical properties of our uligs match those of the sub - mm galaxies ?",
    "@xcite divide the observed sub - mm counterparts into three classes .",
    "class ii galaxies are bright , with obvious optical counterparts .",
    "class i galaxies are bright at @xmath77 , but faint in optical : they are bright eros .",
    "class 0 galaxies have no obvious counterparts down to @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite examine nine sub - mm sources , and suggest that 40%70% of the sub - mm population are in very faint or red galaxies ; two of these ( @xmath123% ) are eros ( class i ) .",
    "our uligs and ligs exhibit a wide range of rest - frame uv / optical properties , reminiscent of the sub - mm galaxies .",
    "we found that some of our uligs might appear as eros at either @xmath109 or @xmath110 .",
    "but the sub - mm eros are bright at @xmath77 , and at those redshifts , our uligs would be faint .",
    "only one of the five uligs in our sample ( iras 08572 + 3915 ) would have @xmath124 at @xmath109 ; by @xmath110 , all would have @xmath125 even scaling up the uv fluxes from our uligs by factors of a few ( to match the fir luminosity differences ) would not be sufficient to render them easily observable . in summary , our uligs ( at @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) would all be fainter and redder than the class ii sources ; mostly fainter than the class i sources ; and so might only be true counterparts of the class 0 sources .    where are the local class ii and class i counterparts ?",
    "we speculate on three possibilities .",
    "first , the number of uligs increases strongly with redshift , so perhaps class i / ii galaxies are simply vanishingly rare at low redshift .",
    "second , perhaps differences in properties such as metallicity result in the sub - mm galaxies being more transparent in the rest - frame uv / optical than the uligs .",
    "third , while local uligs occur almost exclusively in recent or ongoing mergers , perhaps sub - mm galaxies are made in a different way , with corresponding differences in properties .",
    "the extended nature of smm j14011 + 0252 hints at this tantalizing possibility . in the local universe ,",
    "generating @xmath126 in a galaxy appears to virtually always require a collision and subsequent collapse of the ism to a dense state in the inner kpc .",
    "perhaps galaxies were somehow able to generate these energies without such collapse at high redshifts .",
    "if this is true , then local uligs would likely not be good counterparts of sub - mm galaxies .",
    "any real study of the differences awaits much more data on sub - mm galaxies .      in two of our systems ,",
    "vv 114 and iras 08572 + 3915 , we have merging galaxies where one member of each pair is bright in the uv , but the other is much brighter in the near - ir and mid - ir , and ( possibly , for vv 114 ) the fir as well .",
    "if these two systems were sub - mm sources at high redshifts , then optical observations , sensitive to the rest - frame uv , might not even detect the less uv - luminous  and more ir - luminous  member of each pair .",
    "the member of the pair responsible for most of the fir luminosity would become apparent only in mid - ir observations , which are difficult to perform from the ground . on the other hand , optimistically speaking , we might say that we have _ two _ chances to detect early - stage merging systems .",
    "@xcite and @xcite describe the sub - mm selected galaxy smm j14011 + 0252 ( @xmath127 ) , which may be a high redshift example of this .",
    "that system contains two principal components , the morphologically complex j1 , and the relatively compact j2 .",
    "j2 is slightly brighter than j1 at rest - frame uv wavelength of 1000@xmath16  ( observed _ u_-band ) , whereas j1 is brighter than j2 longward of the lyman break ( observed _ b_-band , @xmath128 ) and in the rest - frame red optical ( observed _ k_-band , @xmath129 ) .",
    "from the above , we know that j1 would be stronger than j2 at the rest - frame wavelengths of both our fuv and nuv observations .",
    "very recently , @xcite showed that smm j14011 + 0252 is significantly extended in both interferometric co and radio maps ( @xmath130 kpc in the source plane ) .",
    "further , the co / radio peaks are apparently coincident , but not located at either j1 or j2 . instead ,",
    "the co / radio peak seems to be associated with a newly - discovered , diffuse ero component ( j1n ) , about an arc - second north of j1 .",
    "this is reminiscent again of vv 114 , where the co and sub - mm emission both peak away from the prominent uv / optical / near - ir sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that smm j14011 + 0252 is globally consistent with the irx-@xmath10 correlation , though the rest - frame uv flux is the sum from j1 and j2 .",
    "( likewise , vv 114 is _ globally _ consistent within the scatter of irx-@xmath10 . ) our observations  via analogy to vv 114 and iras 08572 + 3915also suggest that j2 need not dominate the fir emission from the entire source . that the radio peak is apparently associated with a newly - discovered , extended ero region further suggests this .",
    "our study shows that while rest - frame uv images may be useful to detect merging galaxies , they do a rather poor job of pinpointing the dominant energy sources , which may be inconspicuous at rest - frame uv wavelengths .",
    "we have presented new uv images of a sample of seven ligs and uligs taken with the hst .",
    "our principal results are as follows .    1 .",
    "all seven of our uligs were detected in the uv .",
    "they show star clusters and extended emission , with the brightest uv light projected within the central kpc of the most ir - luminous members of the systems in 5/7 cases .",
    "however , the uv peaks are displaced by at least few hundred pc from the peaks in _ i_-band and near - ir images , and so presumably the far - ir peaks as well . at most a few percent of the total uv light",
    "comes from the inner 500 pc , where the majority of the far - ir energy is generated .",
    "most nuclei are reddened .",
    "however , even after correction for dust reddening using the irx-@xmath10 correlation , the observed light even in large apertures is insufficient , by factors of 375 , to account for the far - ir emission . when the uv light in 2 kpc diameter apertures is compared with the fir emission , the deficits typically range from 2 - 4 orders of magnitude",
    "; hence , the reddening is insufficient to account for the large infrared - excesses .",
    "we conclude that the compact nuclear starbursts or agn that dominate the bolometric energies of these galaxies are highly obscured in the uv .",
    "all of the galaxies in this study have been previously noted as showing signs of some agn activity , usually via seyfert 2 or liner spectra .",
    "however , agn are not clearly the source of the high infrared excesses in most cases . in only two cases , iras 08572 + 3915 nw and iras 192547245 s ,",
    "is it likely that agn could dominate the bolometric energy output of the system ; the majority appear to be dominated by star formation . in only one of the two possible agn , iras 192547245 s ,",
    "we may detect direct uv emission from the agn . even in this case , there is no emission in the fuv , and the nuv source is extended , suggesting that a circumnuclear disk , jet , or even star formation may be what is seen in the nuv .",
    "5 .   artifically redshifting",
    "the uv fluxes shows that six of our galaxies would be detectable in hdf - type exposures out to redshifts of at least @xmath93 , yet cosmological surface brightness dimming would render all but two undetectable by @xmath94 .",
    "the galaxies would also have sub - mm fluxes below current detection limits , if placed in that redshift range .",
    "current optical and sub - mm surveys would therefore probably not detect most of our uligs , some of the most luminous objects in the local universe , if they were placed at redshifts much greater than 1.5 .",
    "we have compared our galaxies with 100 _ u_-band dropouts at @xmath56 from the hdf .",
    "if placed at @xmath4 , most of our galaxies would be 23 magnitudes too faint for robust selection as _ u_-band dropouts in catalogs with hdf - like depths .",
    "only one of our galaxies , the uv - bright member of vv 114 , would have made it into the hdf sample .",
    "this suggests that uligs will not be found in samples of bright lyman - break galaxies , though some could perhaps be lurking amongst the fainter and redder lbgs .",
    "7 .   from estimating the @xmath111 and _",
    "k_-band fluxes at @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the ir - dominant nuclei of our five uligs , we find that 2/5 of them would have colors very close to those of extremely red objects .",
    "while some uligs may appear as eros at high-@xmath18 , in general , their faint but significant uv emission makes them somewhat too blue to be classified as eros .",
    "8 .   while our sample is small , the predicted faintnesses and red colors of our uligs , if placed at high redshift , are reminiscent of the extremely faint / red counterparts of many sub - mm galaxies .",
    "however , many sub - mm galaxies have counterparts brighter and/or bluer than our uligs would be at @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "one sub - mm galaxy has been shown to have an extended radio source ; if this is generally true , then that would call into question the use of uligs as low - redshift counterparts .",

    "<S> in an effort to better understand the uv properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) , and compare them to the rest - frame uv properties of high redshift sub - mm and lyman - break galaxies , we have obtained far- and near - uv imaging observations ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , respectively ) of two luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs  vv 114 and ic 883 ) and five uligs ( iras 08572 + 3915 , mrk 273 , iras 15250 + 3609 , arp 220 , and iras 192547245 ) using the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> all the galaxies were detected in both channels . </S>",
    "<S> uv light , both diffuse and from star clusters , can be traced to within the inner kpc of the dominant near - ir nuclei . however , in general , the brightest uv sources are clearly displaced from the @xmath2-band and near - ir peaks by at least hundreds of pc . </S>",
    "<S> further , only 0.07%-7.3% of the total near - uv light is projected within the inner 500 pc radius , even though this is the same region wherein most of the bolometric energy is generated . </S>",
    "<S> all nuclei are highly obscured by dust . even after correction for dust reddening </S>",
    "<S> , the global uv emission fails to account for the total bolometric luminosities of these systems by factors of 375 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is much worse if only the central regions , where the bolometric luminosities are generated , are included . in two cases ( vv 114 and iras 08572 + 3915 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the merging companion galaxies are more prominent in the uv than the more ir - luminous member . while all our galaxies show possible signatures of agn activity , only iras 192547245 yields even a possible detection of an agn in our uv images . </S>",
    "<S> simple calculations show that all but one of our galaxies would be expected to drop below the detection thresholds of , e.g. , the hubble deep fields at redshifts between 1.5 and 3 , and we find that @xmath32 of our 5 uligs would be selected as extremely red objects in this redshift range </S>",
    "<S> . a typical ulig in our sample would be too faint to be detected at high - redshift in the deepest current optical or sub - mm deep surveys . </S>",
    "<S> only vv 114 has uv luminosity and color similar to lyman - break galaxies at @xmath4 ; the other galaxies would be too faint and/or red to be selected by current surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the low uv brightnesses of our uligs mean that they would not appear as optically - bright ( or bright ero ) sub - mm galaxy counterparts , though they might be similar to the fainter sub - mm galaxy counterparts . </S>"
