    "in 2015 , lhcb collaboration reported that two candidates of the new exotic baryons , @xmath9(4380 ) and @xmath9(4450 ) , had been observed in the @xmath10 decay .",
    "the mass of the higher peak , @xmath9(4450 ) , is 4449.8@xmath111.7@xmath112.5 mev with the width of 39@xmath115@xmath1119 mev , while the lower and broader peak , @xmath9(4380 ) , has the mass 4380@xmath118@xmath1129 mev and the width 205@xmath1118@xmath1186 mev .",
    "the most favorable set of the spin parity for the lower and the higher peaks is @xmath12 , but @xmath13 or @xmath14 are also acceptable @xcite . also ,",
    "because the @xmath15 contribution is necessary to describe the decay data @xcite , it is almost certain the peaks have the @xmath16 pair and are considered as the isospin-@xmath17 @xmath3 pentaquarks",
    ".    beside of the predicting work @xcite , the lhcb observation of @xmath9(4380 ) and @xmath9(4450 ) has evoked many theoretical studies : the hadronic molecule with the meson exchange interaction , the chiral unitary approach with the hidden local gauge symmetry , qcd sum rule , the chiral quark model , the diquark / triquark model and the kinematical effects @xcite . at present",
    ", the theoretical and experimental knowledge is not enough and one can not draw a definite picture of these peaks .    here , we concentrate our attention on the short range part of the hidden - charm pentaquark structure , which is governed by the quark and gluon dynamics . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the quark cluster model @xcite , which successfully explained the short range part of the baryon - baryon interaction and the structure of the light flavored pentaquark @xmath18 @xcite . recent lattice qcd results @xcite are similar to the quark cluster model ones for the baryon - baryon interaction .",

    "the energy of the resonance or the cusp does not move much when the @xmath27 and  channels are introduced .",

    "the @xmath32 states consist of seven baryon - meson channels : @xmath33 , @xmath27 , , , , , and , whereas there are five @xmath34 states .",
    "so , there is two forbidden states when the system is totally symmetric in the orbital space .",
    "also in this case , all the diagonal elements of the normalization are close to 1 ; no baryon meson state is affected strongly by the quark pauli - blocking .",

    "the factor to find the color - octet @xmath7 becomes small comparing to the three - channel calculation ;  becomes the largest at the resonance . as we will show later , the coupling to the @xmath27 channel to the  and  channels is stronger in this @xmath31 case . the existence of the attraction in the  or , however , is important to create a resonance .",

    "they are considered to be an appearance of the hidden color - octet @xmath7 baryon .",
    "these resonances and cusp in @xmath37 exist in the energy range of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 42784483 mev .",
    "we argue that these resonances and cusp may combine to form the broad peak of @xmath38 . or ,",
    "if @xmath40 is found to be negative parity , the cusp at 4458 mev may correspond to that peak .",
    "the bound state in @xmath41 , whose energy is higher than both of the observed pentaquark peaks , does not couple to the @xmath4-wave @xmath27 channel ; the higher partial wave mode is necessary to see this bound state from the @xmath27 channel .",
    "there are arguments that peaks which correspond to the pentaquarks should appear at @xmath42 @xcite or @xmath43 @xcite reactions if the coupling between @xmath27 and the pentaquarks is large .",

    "the elasticity of the @xmath31 goes down to 0.65 at the resonance of 4316.5 mev . in both of the channels ,",
    "the mixing between @xmath27 and the other channels is rather small except for the resonance energies , because the quark overlap is small and because the rearrangement of the charm quark is necessary .",
    "the average inelasticity of @xmath27 , @xmath45 , over the energy range of the broad @xmath38 width is about 0.10.2 .",

    "it corresponds to the scattering length @xmath48 fm by using @xmath49 .",
    "this scattering length has been calculated by many theories .",
    "qcdsr gives @xmath50 fm @xcite .",
    "the effects of the qcd van der waals was estimated by @xcite , @xmath51 fm .",
    "two quenched lattice qcd calculations were reported : the spin averaged scattering length was obtained as @xmath52 fm or @xmath53 fm @xcite , or about @xmath54 fm ( read from figure)@xcite . in the present calculation , the @xmath55 scattering length is @xmath56 fm for @xmath24=3 and @xmath57 fm for @xmath24=1 .",
    "the spin averaged value is @xmath58 fm . since the quark interaction does not produce a direct interaction between @xmath29 and the @xmath16 mesons , this attraction here solely comes from the channel coupling between the @xmath27 and the @xmath59 and @xmath59@xmath59 channels .",
    "our results suggest that roughly half of the observed attraction between the @xmath29 and  comes from the channel coupling .    in this work",
    ", we employ the quark interaction arising from the gluons .",
    "it is because we would like to investigate the features of the color - octet @xmath7 baryons , which newly appears in the hidden - charm pentaquarks .",
    "as for the  or  baryon meson channel , however , it is necessary to include the pion - exchange force in the long range region . as is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the meson - exchange models may give many bound states and resonances though the results seem to depend strongly on the cutoff value .",
    "it is very interesting to see whether the currently obtained resonances move by introducing the meson - exchange in our model .",
    "moreover , in order to discuss the @xmath40 , which has an opposite parity to the @xmath38 , simultaneously , the @xmath60-wave baryon - meson relative motion and the positive parity mesons should be introduced .",
    "we take both of them as future problems .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the hidden - charm pentaquarks with the strangeness . as for the @xmath61 isospin-3 systems , the three light quarks are either color - octet spin-1 or color - singlet spin-3 .",
    "because cmi of these light quark configurations contributes repulsively , and because the pauli - blocking gives strong repulsion here , all the five - quark systems seem to dissolve by the baryon - meson couplings , which we will also discuss elsewhere .",
    "the isospin-1 , or the flavor - octet hidden - charm baryons are a special place to look into for the color - octet @xmath7 baryons . when we introduce the @xmath62 pairs instead of @xmath16 to the five - quark systems , the situation will become more manifest .",
    "the system is closer to the heavy quark limit , and the thresholds of the @xmath63 are closer to each other .",
    "we discuss the system with the @xmath62 pairs as well as those with the @xmath64 pairs elsewhere .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 @xmath3 systems are investigated by the quark cluster model .",
    "there is no strong repulsion due to the quark pauli blocking in the relevant baryon meson systems .",
    "it is shown that the color - octet isospin-1 spin-3 @xmath7 configuration gains attraction from the color magnetic interaction .",
    "the @xmath3 states with this configuration cause structures around the @xmath8 thresholds .",
    "we have found one bound state in @xmath2 , one resonance and a cusp in @xmath1 , and one resonance in @xmath31 in the negative parity channels .",
    "we argue that one of these structures may give @xmath40 if its parity is found to be negative , or these resonances and cusp may combine to form the broad peak of @xmath38 .",
