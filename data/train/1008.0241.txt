    "asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a non - equilibrium process in which particles hop to the neighboring site in a specific direction following certain conditions @xcite . in the simplest model",
    ", particles obey the mutual exclusion condition due to which a site can not be occupied by more than one particle and a hop to the neighboring site is possible provided this target site is empty .",
    "the particles after being injected at one end of the lattice at a rate @xmath0 hop across the lattice and reach the other end where they are withdrawn at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "there exist other models where particles can have attractive or repulsive interaction in addition to the exclusion interaction @xcite .    all these systems exhibit interesting boundary - induced phase transitions for which the tuning parameters are the boundary rates , @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xcite . in different phases",
    ", the average particle density has distinct constant values across the bulk of the lattice .",
    "these particle density profiles in different phases may also differ due to different location and nature of the boundary - layers .",
    "more features , such as coexistence of high and low - density regimes are seen in systems where particle number is not conserved in the bulk due to attachment and detachment of particles to and from the lattice @xcite . in this coexistence phase (",
    "also known as a shock phase ) , the particle density profile has a jump discontinuity ( shock ) in the interior of the lattice from a low to a high density value .",
    "the slope and the number of such shocks in a density profile are related to the nature of the inter - particle interactions which determine the fundamental current density relation @xcite .",
    "although this relation predicts the kind of shocks that can be seen @xcite in the density profile , a systematic characterization of the phase - transition and the phase diagram in the @xmath3 plane requires a detailed analysis of the relevant equations describing the dynamics in the steady - state @xcite .",
    "drawing analogies from the equilibrium phase transitions , first order , critical @xcite and tricritical @xcite kind of phase transitions have been observed so far in various asep models .    while characterizing the phase transitions",
    ", it is useful to study the variation of the height or the width of the boundary - layers as @xmath0 and @xmath2 are changed . in a way , these boundary - layers play important roles in deciding the `` order parameter '' like quantities in these non - equilibrium phase transitions . owing to their importance in describing phase transitions , the boundary - layers for several interacting and non - interacting models",
    "have been studied using the techniques of boundary - layer analysis @xcite .",
    "it is found that the system usually enters into a shock phase from a non - shock phase due to the deconfinement of the boundary - layer from the boundary .",
    "this deconfinement can be described by a nontrivial scaling exponent associated with the width of the boundary - layer @xcite . for the pure exclusion case , except for a critical point ,",
    "the transition from a non - shock to a shock phase is first order in nature since a shock of finite height is formed on the phase boundary .",
    "the height of the shock on the phase boundary reduces as one approaches the critical point along the phase boundary . at the critical point ,",
    "the shock height is zero on the phase boundary and it increases continuously as one proceeds away from the phase - boundary further into the shock phase . in order to visualize these features , it is beneficial to obtain the full solution for the density profile along with its boundary - layer .",
    "boundary layer analysis is useful for this purpose since it allows us to generate a uniform approximation for solving the steady - state particle density equation across the entire lattice .",
    "this steady - state equation can be obtained from the large time- and length - scale limit ( hydrodynamic limit ) of the statistically averaged master equation that describes the particle dynamics in the discrete form . for the simple exclusion case , it is possible to obtain an analytical solution of the steady - state hydrodynamic equation for the entire density profile .",
    "this , however , may not possible for more complex aseps .",
    "a fixed - point analysis of the hydrodynamic equation turns @xcite out to be general and useful , since it does not involve an explicit solution of the steady - state hydrodynamic equation . in particle conserving models , a boundary - layer saturates to the constant bulk density profile",
    "asymptotically . as a consequence of this",
    ", it is expected that the fixed - points of the boundary - layer equation match with the bulk density values .",
    "in other words , a boundary - layer , which is a solution of the boundary - layer equation , is a part of the flow trajectory of the equation flowing to the appropriate fixed - point on the phase plane .",
    "thus , in order to find out the values of the bulk - densities in different phases , it is sufficient to determine the physically acceptable fixed - points of the boundary - layer equation . as a result",
    ", the number of possible bulk phases is given by the number of these fixed - points .",
    "applying this method to a specific particle conserving two - species asep @xcite , it is found that this system has three distinct bulk phases corresponding to three fixed - points of the boundary - layer equations .",
    "in addition , it is possible to predict the nature of phase transitions , locations of the boundary - layers _ etc .",
    "_ for this system .",
    "all these predictions match well with the results from numerical simulations @xcite .    in a particle non - conserving case ,",
    "the density is not constant in the bulk , and therefore , the fixed - points of the boundary - layer do not provide the full profile since the details of the bulk dynamics is not considered in this approach .",
    "however , it is still useful to obtain the fixed - points of the boundary - layer equations along with their stability properties in order to predict the possible shapes of the density profiles under different boundary conditions . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a particle number non - conserving model where particles interact repulsively .",
    "our aim is to extend the fixed - point analysis to a system with non - constant bulk density .",
    "we show how this analysis helps us predict possible shapes of the density profiles under different boundary conditions and also understand the properties of different kinds of shocks present in the density profile .",
    "this particular model is chosen because of certain nontrivial shapes of the density profiles with different kinds of shocks .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the model .",
    "this section also contains brief discussions on the hydrodynamic approach , boundary - layer analysis and some of the known results . in section iii , we present the phase - plane analysis of the boundary - layer equations for the present model .",
    "there are separate subsections on the boundary - layer equation , its fixed - points , stability analysis of the fixed - points and possible shapes of shocks .",
    "section iv presents the predictions of the possible shapes of the density profile under different boundary conditions . in section",
    "v , we mention a few general rules for predicting the shapes of the density profiles and some special features related to the shocks of this model .",

    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process that we consider here consists of a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath4 sites with lattice spacing , @xmath5 .",
    "particles are injected at @xmath6 with rate @xmath0 and withdrawn at @xmath7 at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "particles , obeying mutual exclusion , hop to the right with rates that depend on the occupancy of the neighboring site as @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) represents an occupied ( unoccupied ) site . for @xmath12 , there is an effective repulsion between the particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , the number of particles is not conserved due to particle detachment , @xmath13 , at a rate @xmath14 and attachment , @xmath15 , at a rate @xmath16 at any site on the lattice .",
    "particle attachment and detachment are equilibrium like processes that do not give rise to any particle current .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach is based on the lattice continuity equation which equates the time evolution of the particle occupancy at a given site with the difference of currents across its two neighboring bonds . in the continuum description ,",
    "the continuous time and space variables are @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the latter replacing , for example , the @xmath19th site as @xmath20 . upon doing a taylor expansion of the statistically averaged continuum version of the lattice continuity equation in small @xmath5",
    ", one has the following hydrodynamic equation @xmath21 for the averaged particle density @xmath22 .",
    "this equation has already been supplemented with the particle non - conserving parts @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the current , @xmath26 , consists of a bulk current @xmath27 and a diffusive current proportional to @xmath28 as @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a small parameter proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the diffusive current part arises naturally as one retains terms up to @xmath31 in the taylor expansion . in order to determine the particle density , @xmath32 , in the steady - state ( @xmath33 )",
    ", one has to solve the differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the lattice - ends to be attached to the particle - reservoirs which maintain constant densities @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the diffusive current part is crucial here since due to its presence , the hydrodynamic equation becomes a second order differential equation and as a result we can obtain a smooth solution satisfying both the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath36 is the usual asep with only the exclusion interaction . in this case , the current density relation , @xmath37 is an exact one",
    ". the symmetric shape of the current about its maximum at @xmath38 is a consequence of its invariance under particle - hole exchange @xmath39 .",
    "it is well understood that the phase diagram has low - density ( @xmath40 at the bulk ) , high - density ( @xmath41 at the bulk ) and maximum current ( @xmath38 at the bulk ) phases @xcite .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is retained in @xmath12 models although the current changes non - trivially . at @xmath42 ,",
    "i.e. for the extreme repulsion case , hops such as @xmath43 are forbidden .",
    "the current , therefore , vanishes exactly at the half - filling ( @xmath38 ) with the maximum current appearing symmetrically for densities on the two sides of @xmath38 .",
    "the exact form of the current as a function of @xmath44 for arbitrary @xmath45 can be found using a transfer matrix approach @xcite and it evolves from a single to a symmetric double peak structure as @xmath45 grows beyond @xmath46",
    ". a simple , analytically tractable form of the current with double peaks can be obtained by doing a double expansion of the exact current about @xmath47 and @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "the double peak shape appears for @xmath53 . in the entire analysis below , we consider @xmath54 to be a small negative parameter and @xmath55 .    for the boundary - layer analysis ,",
    "it is important to consider the bulk part and the narrow boundary - layer or the shock regions of the density profile separately .",
    "these boundary - layers or shocks are formed over a narrow region of width @xmath56 and they merge to the bulk density in the appropriate asymptotic limit . in order to study the boundary - layer and its asymptotic approach to the bulk , one can rescale the position variable in ( [ fulleqn ] ) as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the location of the center of the boundary - layer . hence , for a boundary - layer satisfying the boundary condition at @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 . for small @xmath30 ,",
    "the boundary - layer approaches the bulk density in the @xmath61 limit and satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath62 . in terms of @xmath63 ,",
    "the steady - state hydrodynamic equation is @xmath64 since @xmath30 is a small parameter , the effect of the particle non - conserving term , @xmath65 , on the boundary - layer is negligible . as a result",
    "the total current , @xmath66 is constant across the boundary - layer .",
    "a shock , therefore , can be represented by a horizontal line connecting two densities in the @xmath67 plane as shown in figure ( [ fig : jvsrho ] ) .     is plotted as a function of @xmath44 .",

    "b represent an upward and a downward shock respectively.,width=3 ]    for an upward shock ( @xmath68 ) , this line lies below the @xmath27 curve and the reverse is true for a downward shock ( @xmath69 ) . as a result , while for @xmath70 , only upward shocks are possible , for @xmath53 , there can be density profiles with a downward shock and double shocks .",
    "double shocks can be represented by two horizontal lines on the @xmath67 plane below the two peaks in @xmath27 .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath30 , the final boundary - layer equation is @xmath71 in the boundary - layer language , the solution of this equation is known as the inner solution . to obtain the bulk part of the density profile , one can ignore the diffusive current part in @xmath72 for small @xmath30 .",
    "the steady - state equation that gives the bulk part of the density profile is @xmath73 the solution of this equation for the bulk part of the profile is known as the outer solution .",
    "these inner and outer solutions contain several integration constants which are fixed by the boundary conditions and other matching conditions of the boundary - layer and the bulk under various limits .",
    "since the slope of the outer solution is obtained from @xmath74 for a given @xmath44 , the slope depends crucially on the signs of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "for all the analysis below , we consider @xmath77 to be large and @xmath0 and @xmath2 to be much smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "double peak structure of the current - density relation leads to two maximum current and one minimum current phases in the phase diagram of the particle conserving repulsion model @xcite . in the maximum and minimum current phases , the bulk density values are those at which the current attains its maximum and minimum values respectively . with these new phases ,",
    "the phase diagram for this model becomes more complex than its non - interacting counterpart .",
    "combining the techniques of boundary - layer analysis and the results from numerical solutions , the phase diagram has been obtained for the particle non - conserving repulsion model @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram has a lot of interesting features including a tricritical point at @xmath78 . in the @xmath79 phase diagram",
    ", this is a special point where two critical lines meet .",
    "it has been found that three different phase diagrams are possible for @xmath70 , @xmath78 and @xmath53 . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the current - density plot is symmetric around @xmath38 with a maximum at @xmath38 .",
    "the nature of the phase diagram is qualitatively similar to the mutually exclusive case with one single critical point . for @xmath53 , with a double peak structure of the current - density plot ,",
    "the phase diagram is more complex with more than one critical point and three different shock phases with the density profile having a single upward shock , double upward shocks and one upward and one downward shock @xcite .",
    "the low - density peak can give rise to a low - density upward shock ( @xmath80 in the shock part ) in the density profile . a single shock of this kind",
    "can be represented by a horizontal line in the @xmath67 plane below the low - density peak .",
    "the critical point corresponds to a situation where the horizontal line reaches the peak position implying a shock of zero height .",
    "the second distinct critical point that involves both the peaks of the current - density plot is not symmetrically related to this .",
    "the density profile , here , has two upward shocks , in which one is a low - density shock and one is a high - density shock with @xmath41 .",
    "the low - density shock , in this case , has the maximum height with its high - density end saturating to @xmath38 .",
    "the high - density shock which is due to the high - density peak of the current - density plot can be of varying height .",
    "the critical point corresponds to the special point where this high - density shock has zero height .",
    "in addition to these regions , there are regions in the phase diagram , where density profiles with a downward shock or a single , symmetric upward shock are found .    in view of the symmetry of the @xmath67 diagram ,",
    "it is natural to expect the two critical points to be related through this symmetry .",
    "previous work , however , shows that the shapes of the density profiles are not related through this symmetry near these two special points . unlike the low - density shock ,",
    "the high - density shock in the density profile is always accompanied by a low - density shock of maximum height .",
    "the following analysis clearly reveals the reasons behind such asymmetries .",
    "in the following subsections , we determine the fixed - points of the boundary - layer equation and their stability properties .",
    "these fixed - points are the special points to which the boundary - layer solution saturates in the appropriate limit .",
    "the knowledge about the fixed - points and their stabilities can , therefore , be used to our advantage to find out , for example , the bulk densities to which a shock or a boundary - layer saturates at its two edges .      substituting the expression for @xmath27 as given in ( [ jr ] ) and integrating the boundary - layer equation , ( [ blayerfinal ] ) once ,",

    "an upward shock , represented by a vertical line similar to either ( b ) or ( d ) appears . in the latter case",
    ", the dashed line ( a ) should be extended further till it reaches the low - density end of ( d ) . if the shock is represented by ( b ) , it is a large shock , symmetric around @xmath127 . in the second case , the shock is a low - density shock with the saturation densities being @xmath137 and @xmath158 .",
    "if the density approaches the @xmath117 branch after the large shock , the boundary condition at @xmath59 can be satisfied after that by a decrease in density along ( c ) on this branch .",
    "if the shock is of ( d ) kind , the density has to change further to satisfy the right boundary condition . upon reaching @xmath127 value ,",
    "the density may change along @xmath159 or the @xmath149 branch .",
    "the flow around @xmath108 , however , suggests that the density variation only along @xmath149 branch ( path ( e ) in the figure ( [ fig : densprof3 ] ) ) is possible .",
    "the continuously increasing part along ( e ) is then followed by another upward shock , given by line ( f ) , taking the density to @xmath117 branch .",
    "the boundary condition is then satisfied by a continuously decreasing part along a ( c ) type line .",
    "numerical solutions in figure ( [ fig : densprof3]b ) are consistent with these predictions .",
    "we next consider a case @xmath160 with @xmath139 increasing from large negative values . here",
    "we specifically mention how the density profile changes as @xmath139 is changed keeping @xmath140 fixed . in the process , we observe how a density profile with a downward shock appears .",
    "let us assume that our starting @xmath139 lies somewhere on the @xmath118 branch .",
    "@xmath86 increases from @xmath147 along @xmath118 branch till it reaches the boundary @xmath59 .",
    "this continuously increasing part is represented by ( 1a ) in figure ( [ fig : densprof4]a ) .",
    "the density , then , satisfies the right boundary condition through a boundary - layer which can be , for example , represented by a vertical line like ( 1b ) , in figure ( [ fig : densprof4]a ) .",
    "this line takes the solution from the unstable fixed - point @xmath118 to the stable fixed - point @xmath117 .",
    "since the vertical line ( 1b ) passes through @xmath140 before reaching the @xmath117 branch , the boundary - layer satisfies the boundary condition before saturating to the positive fixed - point , @xmath117 .",
    "the boundary - layer at @xmath59 is , therefore , a part of this vertical , constant-@xmath83 line .",
    "\\(a ) + ( b ) + ( c )    as @xmath139 is increased slightly , the route of the density along @xmath118 branch remains the same but this time the density reaches a higher value than the previous @xmath139 case before increasing sharply as a boundary - layer satisfying the boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "as @xmath139 is increased further , for a given @xmath139 , the continuously increasing part of the profile reaches the low - density end of the line ( 2b ) .",
    "after this , there is a shock in the density profile of ( 2b ) kind .",
    "this is a low - density shock that takes the density to @xmath108 .",
    "if this jump is near the boundary , this shock becomes actually a boundary - layer that can help the density satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "however , if this discontinuity is in the bulk , it is an upward low - density shock . in case of a shock in the bulk",
    ", the density increases further along @xmath149 branch ( path ( 2c ) in figure ( [ fig : densprof4 ] ) ) .",
    "the boundary condition , however , demands a decrease in @xmath86 .",
    "this is possible through a downward vertical line ( similar to path ( 2d ) ) and then a continuously decreasing part ( 2e ) along @xmath159 branch .",
    "the path ( 2d ) is a downward shock that is seen in figure ( [ fig : densprof4]b ) and ( [ fig : densprof4 ] c ) . in case",
    "the density varies along lines ( 3c ) and ( 3d ) , we have a downward boundary - layer near @xmath59 .",
    "these possibilities are expected if @xmath139 is increased further from its value that leads to ( 2c ) and ( 2d ) type variations .",
    "as before , the principle is that if the ( 3d ) type vertical line intersects @xmath140 line before reaching the @xmath159 branch , ( 3d ) type line represents a boundary - layer satisfying the boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "if the reverse happens , this downward vertical line represents a downward shock at the bulk which needs to be followed by a continuously decreasing density part along the @xmath159 branch .",
    "this is a general principle which can be applied to other cases also to see the deconfinement of a boundary - layer giving rise to a shock in the bulk ( see reference @xcite ) .    with further increase of @xmath139 , the density variation from from @xmath146 end ,",
    "is still the same as before up to part ( 3c ) along the @xmath149 curve except that now the density approaches closer to @xmath155 along ( 4c ) like path .",
    "finally for a given @xmath139 , the density reaches the value @xmath155 .",
    "after this , the boundary condition is satisfied through a depleted boundary - layer represented by vertical path ( 4d ) . with further increase of @xmath139 ,",
    "the density can not now go around @xmath155 to move to @xmath117 branch due to the constraint from the stability property . in that case ,",
    "the only option for the density is to proceed along ( 4c ) but move to @xmath161 branch along a vertical line similar to ( 5d ) before reaching the point @xmath155 .",
    "there is now a second high - density upward shock in the density profile at larger @xmath18 ( line ( 5d ) ) with the first shock being a low - density one represented by the line , ( 2b ) . with the increase of @xmath139 , the ( 5d ) type vertical line moves to higher values of @xmath83 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath59 is now satisfied by the rest of the density profile where the density decreases continuously along ( 5e ) path to the minimum @xmath155 and after that decreases through a depleted boundary - layer represented by the line ( 4d ) .",
    "thus , for example , for this value of @xmath139 , we see the following parts in the density profile as we move along the density profile from its @xmath146 end .",
    "( i ) a continuously varying density profile that satisfies the boundary condition @xmath162 .",
    "( ii ) this is followed by a low - density upward shock of maximum height connecting @xmath158 and @xmath137 .",
    "( iii ) beyond this shock , there is again a continuously increasing part .",
    "( iv ) this is followed by an upward , high - density shock . ( v ) beyond this high - density shock , the density decreases continuously to @xmath155 .",
    "( vi ) the last part is a particle - depleted boundary layer , that saturates to @xmath155 for @xmath163 and satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath148 .",
    "all these features can be verified from the density profile in figure ( [ fig : densprof4]a ) .",
    "if @xmath139 is increased further , the upward high - density shock ( vertical lines like ( 5d ) ) will move towards higher @xmath83 values . for certain @xmath139 , the low and the high - density shocks merge and there is a big symmetric shock with @xmath107 . beyond this @xmath139 ,",
    "the big upward shock still persists and this is followed by a continuously varying part ( similar to ( 1c ) ) along which the density decreases and approaches @xmath155 .",
    "the boundary condition is again satisfied by the particle - depleted boundary - layer represented by ( 4d ) .",
    "since the boundary - layers or shocks are the special features through which the density profiles are distinguished , our general predictions are more on the kind of shocks or boundary - layers that can be seen under various boundary conditions .",
    "downward shock in the bulk or a particle - depleted boundary - layer at @xmath59 : either of these features appears whenever the density profile decreases through a jump discontinuity from the @xmath149 branch to the @xmath159 branch or from @xmath155 to @xmath164 .",
    "the condition for this is @xmath154 .",
    "the value of @xmath139 is somewhat flexible since it is possible to see these features both for @xmath139 positive or negative .",
    "upward symmetric shock in the bulk or depleted boundary - layer at @xmath146 : this is seen whenever the density profile jumps from @xmath118 to @xmath117 .",
    "this happens for various combinations of @xmath139 and @xmath140 such as @xmath165 or @xmath166 with @xmath144 or @xmath154 . at @xmath146 ,",
    "the density profile may start with a continuously varying part followed by a symmetric large shock , or it can satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath146 with the help of a boundary - layer . in both cases ,",
    "the discontinuity in the density corresponds to a discontinuous jump from @xmath118 to @xmath117 .",
    "the presence or absence of a boundary - layer at @xmath146 is specified completely by the value of @xmath83 at @xmath146 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath167 line intersects the curve on figure ( [ fig : c0route ] ) at a value @xmath168 .",
    "a condition as @xmath169 , would mean a continuously varying density near @xmath146 .",
    "if these two values are unequal , it would imply the presence of a boundary - layer .",
    "for example , for @xmath153 , a particle - rich or a particle - depleted boundary - layer appears if @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively . however , it is important to pay attention to certain situations which are forbidden due to the stability properties .",
    "for example , if @xmath172 , a boundary - layer with @xmath173 is not possible .",
    "double shock : in this case , the density profile has both high and low - density upward shocks with the low - density shock having maximum possible height , @xmath174 . in order to have a high - density shock",
    ", the lower end of the high - density shock must be on the @xmath175 branch .",
    "the density can reach this branch only via @xmath127 point . the only way the density can reach the @xmath127 point is through a low - density shock represented by the @xmath107 line across the negative lobe . a low - density shock representing a jump across the negative lobe along @xmath107 line",
    "has the maximum possible height .",
    "a density - profile with double shock may appear for @xmath172 and @xmath154 or @xmath144 . in case of @xmath144 , the density after the high - density shock varies continuously along @xmath117 branch to satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath154 , the second shock is possible for some @xmath139 . in this case , after reaching the @xmath117 branch , the density decreases till @xmath155 and then decreases further as a depleted boundary - layer at @xmath59 to satisfy the boundary condition .",
    "it is interesting to note that although it is possible to have a profile with only a low - density shock , the same with a single high - density shock is never possible .",
    "the flow behavior suggests that a high - density shock has to be always accompanied by a low - density shock of maximum height .",
    "boundary - layer at @xmath59 : as in the case of a boundary - layer at @xmath59 , it is also possible to specify the conditions for a boundary - layer at @xmath59 by comparing the value of @xmath176 with @xmath177 . in general , a boundary - layer will appear at @xmath59 if these two values of @xmath83 are different .",
    "as an example , a downward boundary - layer for @xmath178 appears if @xmath179 .      from equation ( [ finalinner ] ) , we find that near the saturation to a bulk density @xmath84 , the slope of the boundary - layer is given by @xmath180 where it is assumed that the boundary - layer density is @xmath181 away from the saturation value , @xmath84 .",
    "this shows , that the saturation of the boundary - layer to the bulk is in general exponential except for three special points .",
    "the saturation is of power - law kind , if @xmath90 or @xmath182 .",
    "the length scale associated with the exponential approach of the shock to the bulk density diverges as the bulk density approaches these special values .",
    "as discussed in subsection [ known ] , the critical points , correspond to special boundary conditions @xmath183 at which the shock height across the positive or negative lobe reduces to zero .",
    "therefore , the approach to the critical point is associated with the continuous vanishing of the shock height along with the divergence of the length scale over which the shock saturates to the bulk .",
    "here , we have considered an asymmetric simple exclusion process of interacting particles on a finite , one dimensional lattice .",
    "these particles have mutual repulsion in addition to the exclusion interaction .",
    "apart from the hopping dynamics of the particles , the model also has particle attachment - detachment processes , which lead to particle non - conservation in the bulk .",
    "such processes are known to exhibit boundary - induced phase transitions for which the tuning parameters are the boundary densities , @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in different phases ,",
    "the average particle density distributions across the lattice have distinct shapes with various types of discontinuous jumps from one density value to another . here",
    ", we carry out a phase - plane analysis for the boundary - layer differential equation to understand how the fixed - points of the boundary - layer equation and their flow properties determine the shape of the entire density profile under given boundary conditions .",
    "such a fixed - point analysis has been extremely useful in understanding the phases and phase transitions of particle conserving models for which the constant bulk density values in different phases are given by the physically acceptable fixed - points of the boundary - layer equation .",
    "in addition , the number of steady - state phases , the nature of the phase - transitions , the locations of the boundary - layers can be obtained analytically from the phase - plane analysis of the boundary - layer equation .",
    "the present work provides a generalization of the method to a particle non - conserving process .    to apply this method ,",
    "we have considered the hydrodynamic limit of the statistically averaged master equation describing the particle dynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic equation , describing the time evolution of the average particle density , looks like a continuity equation supplemented with the particle non - conserving terms .",
    "the current contains the exactly known hopping current and a regularizing diffusive current part .",
    "the boundary - layer equation , which is the main focus of this work , can be obtained from the particle conserving part of the hydrodynamic equation . for convenience ,",
    "we use @xmath82 for the boundary - layer equation .",
    "@xmath86 is related to the deviation from @xmath38 ( half filled case ) .",
    "it is found that the fixed - points , @xmath93 , of the boundary - layer equation are determined in terms of a parameter @xmath83 related to the excess current measured from @xmath38 ( half - filled case ) .",
    "since the fixed - points are dependent on @xmath83 , one can plot the physically acceptable fixed - points as a function of @xmath83 on the @xmath141 plane . in the steady - state",
    ", the constancy of the current across a shock or a boundary - layer implies that such objects can be represented by a fixed value of @xmath83 .",
    "the boundary - layers or shocks of the density profiles are represented by the constant-@xmath83 lines on this @xmath141 plot .",
    "the densities at which the constant-@xmath83 line intersects the fixed - point branches are the densities to which the shock or the boundary - layer saturates .",
    "the discontinuous change of the density has to be consistent with the stability properties of the fixed - points . for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath2",
    ", we can start from the @xmath146 end of the density profile and find out how the density can change along the profile as it proceeds to satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "this density variation along the density profile can be conveniently marked on the @xmath141 plot to see its consistency with the flow properties of the fixed - points .",
    "our approach does not give any information about the location of a shock since it does not involve the details of the bulk part of the profile .",
    "instead , it is found that the conserved quantity , @xmath83 , plays an important role in deciding the shape of the density profile .",
    "the emphasis of our approach is on the boundary - layer equation which appears to control the shape of the entire density profile .",
    "particle non - conserving processes are not important for the boundary layers .",
    "this simplicity allows us not only to classify different kinds of density distributions , but also to gain more physical insight as why some features of the density profile are evident under certain boundary conditions .",
    "some of these features are mentioned in the list below .",
    "\\(a ) when a density profile has two shocks , the low - density shock is of maximum possible height . for given values of the interaction parameters , the height of the low - density shock can be obtained explicitly .",
    "\\(c ) a downward shock is produced by the deconfinement of a downward boundary - layer at @xmath59 .",
    "the condition on @xmath2 for seeing a downward shock or a downward boundary - layer at @xmath59 can be precisely specified .",
    "\\(d ) the symmetric two peak structure of the current as a function of the particle density is responsible for a symmetric two lobe structure of the fixed - points drawn on @xmath141 plane .",
    "the flow behavior of the fixed - points around the two lobes are asymmetric .",
    "this is the reason why the two critical points in the phase diagram are not symmetrically related to each other .",
    "this asymmetry is reflected in the shapes of the density profiles near these critical points .",
    "in addition to these issues , this analysis also provides quantitative predictions regarding the heights of different kinds of shocks and their approach to the bulk along with the length scale associated with it .",
