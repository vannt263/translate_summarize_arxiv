    "one of the most interesting features of a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) in dimension three is that it naturally implies projective representations of mapping class groups of surfaces .",
    "the question which motivates this article is how the decomposition structure of these representations changes as one passes from tqfts constructed from @xmath6 to tqfts constructed from higher rank lie algebras .",
    "more precisely , a tqft can be constructed from the representation theory of a finite dimensional quasi - triangular hopf algebra .",
    "particularly , for any complex simple lie algebra @xmath7 and any root of unity @xmath8 such a hopf algebra is given by a quantum group @xmath9 , and , hence , defines an associated tqft which we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "basis elements of the vector spaces of this tqft are typically enumerated by graphs or links whose edges are labeled by weights of @xmath11 in the associated weyl alcove .",
    "restricting @xmath12 to subspaces in which basis elements are labeled by only roots of @xmath11 , one naturally obtains a sub - tqft denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath14 differs from @xmath15 only by tensoring with a trivial tqft based on @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "commonly , @xmath17 is also referred to as the tqft associated to quantum @xmath0 .    in the case where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is of prime order roberts proved in @xcite that the mapping class group representations obtained from @xmath20 are indeed irreducible .",
    "irreducibility is a crucial feature of the @xmath21-tqft in a number of applications such as the generation of integral bases from cyclic vectors or mutation invariance with respect to the central hyperelliptic involutions in genus @xmath22 .",
    "yet , hardly anything is known about the reducibility question for representations obtained from @xmath13 for higher rank lie algebras @xmath11 or for @xmath23 s of non - prime orders .",
    "the main result of this article is that irreducibility fails in several ways for higher rank lie algebras .",
    "more precisely , we provide explicit decompositions of the representations of the mapping class group of the torus @xmath24 for @xmath25 but @xmath23 still of prime order and identify respective summands with representations coming from @xmath26 .",
    "the genus one case reveals already a fair amount of the structure of the tqft on general cobordisms , suggesting reducibilities also for higher genera .",
    "in fact , representations of the modular group @xmath2 have been a topic of intensive study in conformal field theory as well as analytic number theory . in particular ,",
    "the closely related cft modular invariants for @xmath25 have been analyzed and classified , for example , in @xcite , and we will use symmetries already mentioned in @xcite .    the computations of this paper also serve as explicit examples and a starting point for the more general approach taken in @xcite . there",
    "we use methods and techniques previously developed for the study of theta functions in analytic number theory in order to give the complete decompositions of the @xmath2 representations obtained from @xmath27 into irreducible representation types of @xmath2 for all lie algebras @xmath28 of rank two when @xmath8 is of order @xmath29 with @xmath30 an odd prime .",
    "further work will investigate in how far decompositions found here will extend to higher genus representations .      before turning to our main result for @xmath25",
    ", we consider the @xmath31-symmetry obtained by replacing weights or color labels by their conjugates .",
    "it naturally endows a large family of tqfts constructed from higher rank lie algebras with a respective @xmath31-grading .",
    "[ main - thm-1 ] suppose @xmath32 and @xmath23 is of order @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 coprime . then the tqft @xmath36 ( as in @xcite ) commutes with a @xmath31-action on each @xmath37 for any closed , compact , orientable surface @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , the tqft is @xmath39-graded with a decomposition as follows : @xmath40 the @xmath31-action on @xmath37 is non - trivial whenever @xmath38 is not the union of spheres @xmath41 .    in particular",
    ", the representation of the mapping class group of @xmath38 induced by @xmath15 is obviously reducible into the two graded parts .",
    "the basic parity splitting from theorem  [ main - thm-1 ] is , however , far from the only decomposition of the mapping class group representations in the higher rank case .",
    "in fact , the summands @xmath42 are generally still further reducible into many more components .",
    "particularly , in the genus one case for @xmath8 of prime order only a few representation types of the modular group @xmath2 can occur which , necessarily , will repeat themselves more and more often in decompositions for higher rank lie algebras .    the main theorem of this paper makes this phenomenon explicit in the concrete example of the @xmath2-representation of @xmath3 type , which turns out to contain summands of representations of @xmath5-type as well as other representation types .",
    "[ main - thm-2 ] suppose that @xmath43 is an odd prime and @xmath44 .",
    "assume further @xmath4 and let @xmath45 .",
    "then the @xmath2 representation obtained from @xmath46 occurs as a summand in the @xmath2 representation obtained from @xmath47 .",
    "the proof will identify a specific basis for the respective submodule of the @xmath2 representation of @xmath3 type .",
    "the equivalence is shown by explicitly computing that the restricted matrix coefficients of the @xmath2 generators acting on this subspace coincide with the respective coefficients for the @xmath5 type representation of @xmath2 .",
    "the decomposition is derived from additional symmetries of the root lattice , given that the latter can be viewed as a quadratic extension over @xmath48 with a dihedral automorphism group .",

    "the @xmath39-action asserted in theorem  [ main - thm-1 ] can be constructed for all tqfts , @xmath49 , for which the vector space @xmath50 associated to surface @xmath38 is obtained from the skein module @xmath51 of a handle body , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and for which the following further assumptions hold .",
    "firstly , we assume @xmath54 so that for any link @xmath55 an invariant @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the skein class of the link .",
    "we also assume that the relations underlying the skein module are orientation invariant so that there is a well defined @xmath39-action on @xmath51 obtained by mapping the class @xmath59 of each link @xmath60 to the class @xmath61 of the link @xmath62 with reversed orientation .",
    "note , that this implies @xmath63 for the invariant since @xmath64 .",
    "finally , we assume that the special element @xmath65 in @xmath66 implementing 0-surgery along the core of the full torus is also invariant under orientation reversal .",
    "recall , that the vector space @xmath50 is obtained as a subquotient of @xmath51 as follows .",
    "consider an unknotted embedding of @xmath52 into @xmath67 such that its complement is again a handle body @xmath68 .",
    "given that @xmath69 a link @xmath70 and a link @xmath71 obviously combine to a link @xmath72 , so that we obtain the following bilinear form on the level of skein classes @xmath73 of links : @xmath74 the space @xmath50 is now defined by dividing @xmath51 by the null - space of this form . since @xmath75 the null - space is preserved under the @xmath39-action so that it is well defined on @xmath76 . for a framed link @xmath60 in @xmath52 , we denote by @xmath77 $ ] the corresponding element in @xmath78 , and by @xmath79 the involution given by @xmath80)=[\\overline l]$ ] which generates the @xmath39-action . for a disconnected surface @xmath81 the @xmath39-action on @xmath82",
    "is given by @xmath83 .    in order for @xmath50 to be @xmath39-graded",
    "the tqft needs to be equivariant with respect to this action .",
    "that is , @xmath84 has to commute with @xmath85 for any cobordism @xmath86 .",
    "it suffices to show this for connected @xmath87 .",
    "suppose @xmath88 and @xmath89 are collections of handle bodies with @xmath90 , @xmath91 are respective complements in @xmath67 , and @xmath92 is the interior connected sum of components of @xmath93 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath87 can be obtained by surgery on a framed link @xmath94 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details and link calculus ) .",
    "the spaces @xmath95 and @xmath96 are spanned by classes of links @xmath97 and @xmath98 . a general matrix element is thus given by @xmath99 , { \\mathcal v}_{\\mathscr s}(m ) .",

    "it is now obvious from ( [ eq - vmme ] ) that a matrix element of @xmath103 differs from the one for @xmath104 by orientation reversal on @xmath101 .",
    "however , since we assumed that @xmath65 is invariant under orientation reversal equality follows .    it remains to show that the tqft as defined in is @xcite based on the homflypt polynomial fulfills the assumptions made at the beginning of the proof .",
    "note , that the modularity condition needed to construct a tqft from the skein theory was proved in @xcite only for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 prime ( see lemma 4.2 ) , but was later shown in @xcite to apply also to the more general situation with @xmath105 ( see lemma 2.9 and theorem 2.11 ) .",
    "the fact that the homflypt skein module of @xmath67 is one dimensional is what makes the homflypt polynomial of links well defined .",
    "it readily follows from inspection of the homflypt skein relation diagrams that the respective skein ideal is invariant under orientation reversal .",
    "specifically , orientation reversal yields the same diagrams as a rotation by @xmath106 in the plane of projection for the standard presentation of the relations .    for the verification of the last assumption , recall that the element @xmath65 is ( proportional to ) a sum @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a set of young diagrams with @xmath109 rows and at most @xmath34 boxes in each row , @xmath110 the torus skein on @xmath111 strands with inserted wenzl / yokota idempotent , and @xmath112 the associated quantum dimension given by a standard embedding of @xmath110 in @xmath67 .",
    "rigidity of the underlying hecke category and proposition 2.6 of @xcite imply that @xmath113 , where @xmath114(@xmath115 ) is the dual diagram so that also @xmath116 . since @xmath117 this implies @xmath118 as assumed .    finally , in order to prove that the @xmath39-action is non - trivial on @xmath37 for @xmath119 consider the skeins given by @xmath120 and @xmath121 along the core of one of the handles of @xmath52 with @xmath122 .",
    "these yield vectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 in @xmath37 which are mapped to each other under the @xmath39-action .",
    "non - triviality of the latter thus follows if we show that these vectors are not colinear for @xmath125 .    to this end",

    "push the meridian of the handle chosen for @xmath120 off into @xmath127 and replace it by @xmath65 .",

    "denote the respective covector @xmath128 in @xmath129 .",
    "it follows from modularity that for @xmath125 we have @xmath130 but @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "hence @xmath123 and @xmath124 are not colinear and the @xmath39-action is non - trivial .",
    "we expect theorem [ main - thm-1 ] to apply also to tqfts based on lie algebras @xmath133 and @xmath134 as well as other modular categories with non - trivial duals .",
    "a proof would require either finding a skein theoretic formulation that fulfills the assumptions in the above proof , or proving respective symmetries of structure constants ( such as 6-j symbols ) of a corresponding colored graph calculus .",
