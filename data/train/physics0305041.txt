    "nematic ordering in a solution of long rigid rods has been studied theoretically in many papers , starting from the classical papers by onsager @xcite and flory @xcite .",
    "however , there is one aspect of this problem , which has never been considered , namely that this transition always occurs in a gravitational field .",
    "this field induces a concentration inhomogeneity within the volume where nematic ordering takes place .",
    "such inhomogeneity should , in principle , change some of the characteristics of the liquid - crystalline transition .",
    "the dimensionless parameter associated with gravitational field is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of a rod corrected for buoyancy ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the density of pure solvent and the volume of the rod , respectively ) , @xmath7 is the height , @xmath2 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath8 is the temperature and @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant . for @xmath10 cm and room temperature conditions ,",
    "this gives the following criterion : the inhomogeneity due to the normal gravitational acceleration ( @xmath11 m / s@xmath1 ) becomes important for molecular masses of rod more than @xmath12 g / mol .",
    "thus , for rigid rods made of common synthetic macromolecules ( @xmath13 g / mol ) this effect can be neglected .    however , in at least two situations the effect of gravity on the problem of the liquid crystalline transition is important and experimentally relevant .",
    "first , for nematic ordering in solutions of high molecular weight rodlike biological objects ( such as tmv or virus _ fd _ ) @xcite @xmath14 can be very large ( @xmath15 g / mol for tmv,@xcite ) , and values of @xmath16 can easily be reached .",
    "second , instead of normal gravitational acceleration , one can consider the acceleration in an ultracentrifuge which can be @xmath17 times larger than ordinary gravity .",
    "for at least these cases , the investigation of the influence of gravitational field on the nematic ordering in the solution of rigid rods seems to be an important problem .",
    "this problem is solved theoretically below in the onsager approximation .",
    "the onsager approach is based on a virial expansion of the free energy of the solution of rigid rods taking into account steric repulsion only .",
    "let us choose the cartesian coordinate system in such a way that the external field acts in the z direction and put the origin of coordinates at the bottom of the reservoir ( z=0 ) .",
    "further , let us divide the volume of the vessel v into large number of identical layers aligned perpendicularly to the field in order that all particles in a given layer has the same gravitational potential . here",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath18 is the number of rods in the layer z with axis directions within the small spatial angle @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total number of rods in the layer z , and @xmath21 denotes the dimensionless height .",
    "let @xmath22 be one - particle orientational distribution function of rods in the layer z. the normalization for the function @xmath22 is written in the familiar form @xmath23 .    with such division of the volume of the vessel into very large number of layers , the local rod concentration @xmath24 has the same value within the layer .",
    "thus , for a given layer one can apply the traditional onsager theory @xcite , @xcite justified for homogeneous system .",
    "this theory is valid for dilute enough solutions of very long rods .    in this case , the local free energy of the layer labeled @xmath25 is written as @xmath26 where the first term represents the entropy of a translational motion , the second term is the orientation entropy , the third term describes steric interaction of rods in the second virial approximation , and the last term is the average potential energy of a rod in an external gravitational field @xmath27 .    to calculate the third term one assumes that the @xmath28-dependent second virial coefficient @xmath29 is the half of excluded volume of two rods @xcite , thus , @xmath30 ,",
    "where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the length and diameter for long rigid rods and @xmath28 is the angle between directions of long axes .",
    "the free energy of the whole system is a sum of free energies of all layers .",
    "if the number of layers is large enough , the sum can be replaced by integral @xmath33 where    @xmath34    is the orientational entropy of the layer @xmath35 and    @xmath36    is the second virial coefficient of interaction of two rods .    to obtain the equilibrium distribution function we should take into account the possibility of the formation of a phase boundary between the nematic phase at the bottom of the vessel and isotropic phase on top .",
    "we denote the height of the boundary position in the vessel as @xmath37 , so the volumes occupied by the nematic and isotropic phases are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . with this , the free energy of the whole system eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) becomes    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    is the local free energy of the nematic phase , and    @xmath42    is the local free energy of the isotropic phase .    to calculate the equilibrium distribution function @xmath43",
    "one should minimize the functional ( [ eq22 ] ) with respect to this function .",
    "the direct minimization of functional ( [ eq22 ] ) leads to a nonlinear integral equation , which can be solved only numerically @xcite . in the case where the volume of the vessel consists of two phases separated by a phase boundary",
    ", one should realize that @xmath44 follows a step function with the variation of @xmath35 with the function @xmath45 in the anisotropic part significantly different from that in the isotropic phase @xmath46 . to evaluate the distribution function @xmath47 in the nematic phase we apply an approximate variational method with a trial function depending on variational parameter @xmath48 .    substituting this function in eqs .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) , ( [ eq22a ] ) , ( [ eq22i ] ) and minimizing with respect to @xmath49 , we have the following equation for definition of variational function @xmath49 @xmath50    however , the trial function proposed by onsager @xcite @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular deviation of a rod from the director , still leads to rather complicated integral equation . therefore , following @xcite for the sake of simplicity we used a trial function of simpler form @xmath53 with an approximate normalization ( precise up to terms of order @xmath54 ) .",
    "this trial function is suitable for approximate evaluation of @xmath55 in case of highly ordered state @xcite @xmath56 and the dimensionless second virial coefficient in the anisotropic phase @xcite @xmath57 with notation @xmath58 ; the value of @xmath59 being equal to half of average excluded volume of two arbitrary oriented rods .",
    "the corresponding expressions in the isotropic phase are @xmath60    in the above formulas the index @xmath61 and @xmath62 refers to the isotropic phase and the nematic phase respectively , and the angular brackets designate the average with respect to the isotropic distribution function @xmath63 .    substituting the calculated values back in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , yields the following expression for the function @xmath49 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dimensionless local rod concentration in the nematic phase .    thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq22a ] ) , ( [ eq22i ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) give    @xmath66    and    @xmath67    the chemical potentials in the phases can be also obtained    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the local specific volume and @xmath70 is the pressure in the layer @xmath35 :    @xmath71    the calculation of the pressure in the nematic and isotropic phases gives ( compare with ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath72    @xmath73    consequently , eqs .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq12a ] ) , ( [ eq12i ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) give    @xmath74    and    @xmath75    in the equilibrium the chemical potential is independent on height and is the same in the both phases , thus one can obtain the equilibrium local concentrations in the phases :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the average concentration in the nematic phase , @xmath78 is the normalization factor .",
    "also    @xmath79    where the function @xmath80 corresponds to a solution of equation @xmath81 . for dilute solutions we can use the simple asymptotic form of this special function : @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the equilibrium concentrations in the phases are determined by the following coexistence relations at the boundary    @xmath85    substituting calculated values of chemical potentials ( [ eqma ] ) , ( [ eqmi ] ) and pressures ( [ eqpa ] ) , ( [ eqpi ] ) with obtained concentrations in the phases ( [ eqcona ] ) , ( [ eqconi ] ) the coexistence relations ( [ eql ] ) is written as    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are dimensionless average concentrations in the nematic and isotropic phases , respectively .    if the gravitational field is absent ( @xmath89 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eqlas ] ) are reduced to corresponding equations for homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqlas ] ) gives the values of average dimensionless concentrations of the nematic and isotropic phases , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , coexisting at equilibrium .",
    "the phase diagram in the variables average rod concentration @xmath92  dimensionless parameter @xmath93 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this diagram has three main regions . in the region labeled by letter @xmath94 , entire solution of rods",
    "is isotropic ( corresponding height of the boundary @xmath95 ) . in the region between the curves of coexistence @xmath96 and @xmath97 ,",
    "the solution is separated in the isotropic and nematic phases with an interphase boundary between them ( @xmath98 ) . in the region designated by letter @xmath99",
    ", the entire volume of the vessel is occupied by the nematic phase ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this diagram reveals that gravity facilitates formation of the nematic phase ( at least at the bottom of the vessel ) and the region of phase separation becomes very broad even for rather low values of @xmath93 .",
    "dependence of the local rod concentration on the height @xmath35 at fixed value of @xmath93 is shown in fig .",
    "the concentrations @xmath101 and @xmath102 obey the barometric distribution according to eqs .",
    "( [ eqcona ] ) and ( [ eqconi2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the concentrations of the nematic and isotropic phases in the boundary layer coincide with that in the absence of the field ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite ) .",
    "this is the case because all the rods within a given layer exhibit the same gravitational potential .",
    "thus , the rod concentration follows a step function with a jump at the phase boundary .    the corresponding change with height of the order parameter @xmath105 is shown in fig .",
    "the order parameter @xmath106 in the nematic phase is overstated due to the approximate trial function of the form ( [ eq7 ] ) . with increase of @xmath35",
    "the order parameter decreases to the value corresponding to a nematic phase coexisting with isotropic one in the absence of gravity and then falls to zero .",
    "the onsager approximation ( [ eq1 ] ) used in this paper is valid for low rod concentrations ( volume fraction @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , with increase of @xmath93 the local rod concentration at the bottom of the vessel gradually increases .",
    "thus , for high values of @xmath93 barometric distribution ( [ eqcona ] ) is no longer valid .    to generalize the onsager theory for the case of high rod concentrations one can use the parsons approximation@xcite , which aims to improve the second virial coefficient ( [ eq9 ] ) by means of additional multiplier depending on mole fraction of rods , as well as some others generalizations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , the calculations with nonanalitic distribution arising from such an approach are rather complicated and lead to additional integral equation . in most practical cases , except sedimentation in ultracentrifuge , the values of @xmath93 are not too high ( e.g. for tmv @xmath93 is slightly above the unity ) , and traditional",
    "second virial approximation is quite justified .",
    "the position of the phase boundary vs. @xmath93 for different values of total rod concentration is shown in fig .",
    "these plots lead to the following conclusions .",
    "if the total rod concentration is low enough ( i.e. the greater part of the vessel is occupied by the isotropic phase , @xmath108 ) , the increasing gravity induces the isotropic - to - nematic transition and phase boundary shifts toward the top of the vessel .",
    "this process is observed until @xmath109 and then the shift of the boundary stops , and the volume of nematic phase even slightly decreases ( bottom phase is becoming denser under gravity ; solid squares ) .",
    "if the total rod concentration is high enough ( @xmath110 ) the nematic phase simply shrinks under gravity starting from the top of the vessel and the position of the phase boundary becomes gradually lower ( solid circles ) .",
    "furthermore , it is noteworthy to emphasize the important conclusion arising from the form of fig .",
    "the right branch of the plot rises very rapidly as @xmath93 gets large , thus , remaining within the framework of general concepts dealing with spatially homogeneous phases one could suggest that the concentration of rods in the nematic phase should also rapidly increase with @xmath93 . however , the increase in the average concentration in the nematic phase is not as drastic as it follows from fig .",
    "the general reason is that the  rule of lever  can not be applied for the present system , because we are dealing with spatially inhomogeneous phases .",
    "the average concentrations of nematic and isotropic phases , corresponding to phase separation , are shown in fig .",
    "this plot demonstrates that the average concentrations in both phases at fixed value of @xmath93 do depend on the total concentration of rods and they do _ not coincide _ with the concentrations corresponding to the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath111 , where @xmath7 is the total height of the vessel .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath93 is different for separate phases and for the system as a whole .",
    "that is why the average concentrations of the phases lie within the region of phase separation shown in fig .",
    "gravitational or centrifugal external fields facilitate liquid - crystalline transition at the bottom of the vessel and broadens the region of phase separation",
    ". this phenomenon should be noticeable for biological rod - like objects or common lyotropic molecules sedimenting in a centrifugal field .",
