    "topological defects are routinely observed in condensed matter systems and may be expected to form during phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "observational constraints on various types of defects have already played a major role in the development of cosmology  the idea of inflation was introduced in large part to solve the monopole problem .",
    "recently , much attention has been devoted to cosmological models motivated by string / m theory .",
    "symmetry breaking patterns in these models can be quite complex with the production of topological defects being a generic phenomenon .",
    "it has been known for some time that , while topological considerations are sufficient for proving the existence of defects , the properties and interactions of defects depend on the details of the particular model .",
    "these issues were highlighted in earlier studies of domain walls in an @xmath5 model .",
    "in contrast to the commonly studied @xmath6 model , the vacuum manifold now consists of two disconnected pieces , each of which is a 12 dimensional continuum . for topological reasons , kink solutions must exist .",
    "however , a 12 dimensional continuum of possibilities exist when determining the boundary conditions that the minimum energy kink solution satisfies .",
    "topological arguments alone are not sufficient in order to determine these boundary conditions and a more elaborate analysis is needed if one wants to find the kink solution @xcite . only once the boundary conditions are known , can the explicit solution be constructed and the properties worked out . in the case of domain walls in @xmath7 models , this exercise has already yielded some surprises . for example , it was found that the symmetry group inside the core of a domain wall is generally smaller than that of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the interaction of kinks in these models shows that kinks and antikinks can repel as well as attract @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that these features are in fact generic when large group symmetries are involved .",
    "solutions of similar type were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the formation of kinks and domain walls in phase transitions has been studied in earlier work but most of this work only deals with the simplest of systems , such as the @xmath4 kink in a @xmath6 model .",
    "based on the expected initial density and scaling of these walls , cosmological implications have been derived . however , as we show here , the properties of a domain wall network in more complex models can be dramatically different from that of the wall network in the @xmath6 model .",
    "earlier work along these lines can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where they consider the formation and evolution of @xmath8 walls , and in refs .",
    "@xcite where the authors study the fate of walls in @xmath9 motivated models .",
    "an example of new physics that one can expect when considering domain wall formation in these more complex models was provided in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the @xmath7 models allow for the existence of domain wall lattice solutions .",
    "the key ingredient is the repulsion between kinks and antikinks .",
    "the lattice is a periodic sequence of repelling walls and antiwalls that are parallel to each other .",
    "it is more challenging to find a model in which the lattice is stable . in @xcite ,",
    "a model in which @xmath0 ( @xmath10 is the permutation group of @xmath11 objects ) breaks to @xmath1 was used as an example of a model allowing for stable domain wall lattices .",
    "it was argued that in one spatial dimension , in the limit of many correlation domains , the probability of forming a lattice tends to unity .    in this paper",
    "we follow on the work in @xcite and numerically investigate the formation of lattices during realistic phase transitions in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "our results in 1 + 1 dimensions corroborate the argument in @xcite and kink lattices are observed to form with near certainty .",
    "the simulations in 2 + 1 dimensions , however , yield an unexpected feature that , with hindsight , might have been anticipated from the discussion in ref .  @xcite .",
    "instead of forming a lattice , the domain walls form a network with junctions .",
    "six walls meet at a junction and the relaxation of the network is controlled by the dynamics of the junctions .",
    "we find that this leads to considerable changes in the long time dynamical properties of the wall network .",
    "whereas the total length of a @xmath4 network of domain walls is expected to decay as @xmath3 , our junction dominated network has a lower scaling power : @xmath2 .",
    "junction motion and junction / anti - junction annihilation processes clearly slowdown the long time evolution of the network . we did not observe the formation of a lattice of domain walls as the final evolution state in our simulations on a square spatial grid ( with periodic boundary conditions ) . however , when the spatial grid is rectangular , with one dimension somewhat smaller ( by roughly a factor of 3 ) than the other , we did observe kink lattice formation , even in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model and review its features relevant for the process of domain wall lattice formation .",
    "section  [ formation ] contains the simulation results in both one and two spatial dimensions , including a discussion of the scaling regime of the wall network in the @xmath12 case .",
    "finally we discuss how these results may vary for more general systems in different dimensions .",
    "in this section we review some of the results from refs .",
    "@xcite relevant to domain wall lattices . in @xcite @xmath13 was used as an example of a model in which such lattice solutions are stable .",
    "however , the domain wall solutions themselves were identical to those in @xmath5 and we prefer , for clarity reasons , to use this model to describe their main properties .",
    "can be generalized to @xmath7 with @xmath14 .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite . ]",
    "consider an @xmath5 field theory described by a lagrangian : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an @xmath17 adjoint and @xmath18 is invariant under @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath18 be such that the expectation value of @xmath16 spontaneously breaks the symmetry down to @xmath20 .",
    "we will choose @xmath18 to be a quartic polynomial : @xmath21 + h ( { \\rm tr}[\\phi ^2   ] ) ^2 +         \\lambda { \\rm tr}[\\phi ^4 ]   + v_0   \\label{quarticv}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a constant chosen so that the minimum of the potential has @xmath23 .",
    "the lagrangian is symmetric under @xmath24 and it is the breaking of this @xmath4 symmetry that gives rise to topological domain wall solutions . the desired symmetry breaking is achieved in the parameter range @xmath25 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath26 is ( up to any gauge rotation ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that there are several kink solutions in this model corresponding to different choices of asymptotic field configurations . the necessary condition for the existence of a kink solution @xmath30 , proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath31=0 $ ] .",
    "that is , the solution must commute with its asymptotic values .",
    "it was also proved in ref .",
    "@xcite that , when searching for @xmath17 kink solutions , one can work in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath17 , which is equivalent to restricting @xmath30 to a diagonal matrix form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the diagonal generators of @xmath17 : @xmath37    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the kink solution with least energy is achieved if ( up to global gauge rotations ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 the minus sign in front of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ su5phi+ ] ) puts @xmath40 and @xmath41 in disconnected parts of the vacuum manifold .",
    "also , two blocks of entries of @xmath40 are permuted with respect to those of @xmath41 . in other words , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "are related by a non - trivial gauge rotation . the kink solution ( or , domain wall solution , in more than one dimension ) can be written down explicitly in the case when @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "for other values of the coupling constants , the solution has been found numerically @xcite .",
    "the topological charge of a kink can be defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the asymptotic values of the higgs field to the right ( @xmath49 ) and left ( @xmath50 ) of the kink .",
    "( the rescaling has been done for convenience . )",
    "then the charge of the kink in eq .",
    "( [ qeq2solution ] ) is : @xmath51 similarly , one can construct kinks with charge matrices @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) which have @xmath54 as the @xmath55 entry and @xmath56 in the remaining diagonal entries .",
    "hence there are kink solutions with 5 different topological charge matrices .",
    "individually , the kinks can be gauge rotated into one another .",
    "but when two kinks are present , the different charges are physically relevant .",
    "this is most easily seen by noting that the interaction between a kink with charge @xmath52 and an antikink with charge @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "then we have @xmath59 the sign of the trace tells us if the force between the kink and antikink is attractive ( minus ) or repulsive ( plus ) . hence the force between a kink and an antikink with different orientations ( @xmath60 ) is repulsive .",
    "this observation is key to the construction of kink lattices .",
    "a kink lattice is a periodic sequence of kinks with charges such that the nearest neighbour interactions are repulsive .",
    "one can write down a sequence of charges that can form a kink lattice @xcite : @xmath61 and the sequence just repeats itself .",
    "this sequence is the minimum sequence for which the nearest neighbour interactions are repulsive .",
    "another way to write the kink sequence is to write it as a sequence of higgs field expectation values .",
    "we write this sequence for the above minimal lattice : @xmath62 the minimal lattice of 6 kinks is not the only possibility .",
    "a sequence of 10 kinks in the @xmath63 case is aesthetic in the sense that it uses all the 5 different charge matrices democratically : @xmath64 there can be longer sequences as well .    a detailed stability analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed that all domain wall lattices in @xmath5 are unstable .",
    "for example , the lattice in eq .",
    "( [ minlatt ] ) has three unstable modes , corresponding to rotations in the 1 - 3 , 1 - 5 , 3 - 5 blocks .",
    "the instability comes from the fact that an isolated kink has zero modes corresponding to rotations in field space  for example , a kink with charge @xmath65 can be rotated into the kink with charge @xmath66 without any cost in energy . when a kink of charge @xmath65 is placed near an antikink of charge @xmath67 ,",
    "the zero mode becomes an unstable mode , making it favourable for @xmath65 to rotate into @xmath66 after which the kink and antikink can annihilate .    to illustrate that stable lattices can exist",
    ", one can simply start with the model in which the zero modes are completely absent right from the start . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider the model of four real scalar fields @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , with @xmath70 and @xmath71   + { \\lambda \\over { 20 } } [ 4(f_1 ^ 2 + f_2 ^",

    "( [ components ] ) and this model has been obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( [ components ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "this four field model does not have the continuous @xmath17 symmetry of the model in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the only remnant of the @xmath17 symmetry corresponds to the permutation of the five diagonal entries of @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the model also has the @xmath4 symmetry under which @xmath72 .",
    "hence the model has an @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "a vacuum of the model is given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this breaks the symmetry to @xmath1 , corresponding to permutations of @xmath16 in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 blocks .",
    "the vacuum manifold consists of @xmath77 discrete points .",
    "if we fix the vacua at @xmath78 , this implies that there are 20 kink solutions in the model .",
    "all these 20 kink solutions have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the construction of kink lattices proceeds exactly as in the @xmath17 case above because the off - diagonal components of @xmath16 vanish there .",
    "hence the @xmath0 model contains kink lattice solutions as well .",
    "furthermore , these lattices are stable because the dangerous rotational perturbations are absent by the very construction of the model .",
    "there are more repelling kink - antikink pairs in @xmath79 than attracting ones .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that after the phase transition , all attracting walls will eventually annihilate and the remaining walls will be repelling .",
    "the probability of forming a domain wall lattice in one spatial dimension for the @xmath79 model was estimated in @xcite to be unity if the total number of kinks formed is large .",
    "numerical simulations , presented below confirm this expectation . in two spatial dimensions with periodic boundary conditions , our numerical results do not show lattice formation .",
    "instead the walls form a network with junctions that gradually dilutes due to the annihilation of junctions .      in order to generate feasible initial conditions that may lead to the formation of domain wall lattices",
    ", we use a langevin type equation based on the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ s5lagrangian ] ) . each field will be propagated according to its usual equation of motion with additional dissipative and stochastic terms added : @xmath80 @xmath81 is the dissipation constant and the stochastic force @xmath82 is a gaussian distributed field characterised by a temperature @xmath83 : @xmath84 the amplitude of the noise in eq .",
    "( [ noise ] ) is chosen so as to guarantee that independently of the initial field configuration and of the particular value of the dissipation , the system will always equilibrate towards a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath83 .    in both the @xmath85 and @xmath86 cases",
    ", we will start by evolving eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) until thermal equilibrium is reached . at that point",
    "we _ quench _ the system to zero temperature by setting the stochastic term , @xmath87 , in eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) to zero .",
    "the fields will then settle towards the minima of the potential and a network of domain walls will form , separating regions where the fields were initialy uncorrelated .",
    "note that the correlation length @xmath88 at thermal equilibrium depends on @xmath83 ( at high temperatures , @xmath88 typically decreases with @xmath83 ) .",
    "this allows us to have a degree of control over the correlation length of the fields before the quench , and hence over the number of independent domains that will form in the simulation box .",
    "this is essential if we want to be certain to have a number of domains large enough to generate a stable lattice .",
    "the equations of motion were discretized using a standard leapfrog method and periodic boundary conditions were used .",
    "the model parameters were set to @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the lattice spacing was @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "note that for the parameters above the wall core is resolved by more that 10 lattice points which should be accurate enough for the desired purposes .",
    "the value of the dissipation coefficient @xmath81 does not influence the results during the stochastic stage of the simulation and we set it to @xmath94 to ensure rapid thermalization . in the next two sections we will discuss in more detail the role of the dissipation after the quench .",
    "our goal here is to check whether a stable kink lattice forms in one spatial dimension as an initial `` hot '' configuration is quenched to @xmath96 .",
    "applying the procedure detailed in the previous section to the system , we confirm that this is in fact the case . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a series of snapshots of the energy profile of the fields for different times in a typical simulation run .",
    "the first configuration corresponds to the end of the thermalization phase , with large amplitude fluctuations and very uncorrelated fields . at this point",
    "we turn the stochastic term off and let the system evolve for a considerably long time . in this case",
    "we keep the dissipation high since we are not interested in the details of the dynamics of the system but rather in observing a stable lattice as the final outcome . as the energy",
    "is then dissipated , a recognisable pattern of `` proto - kinks '' starts to form , as can be seen in the second snapshot .",
    "the next energy profile shows that the field has relaxed to a fully formed network of kinks . during further evolution ,",
    "neighbouring attractive kink - antikink pairs annihilate , leading to a stable lattice of equidistant domain walls .",
    "this final state is shown in the fourth plot , a succession of mutually repelling kinks and antikinks .",
    "the energy of these defects corresponds to the value predicted analytically , and direct inspection of the values of the four fields @xmath68 confirms that , as expected , we are in presence of a genuine domain wall lattice .      after having established that in one spatial dimension kink lattices can form as a consequence of a phase transition , we will now look at the evolution of the same model in the ( 2 + 1)d case .",
    "here we expect the late time dynamics of the system to be dominated by networks of one - dimensional domain walls . as a consequence of the symmetry content of the model , these networks will be considerably more complex than the ones based on ordinary @xmath4 walls .",
    "in particular , we can expect walls to intersect and kink - antikink repulsion to play a role in the evolution .",
    "our first task is to find a method to identify the walls starting from the field values in the simulation lattice . to this end",
    "it is convenient to convert the fields @xmath97 back into the original @xmath5 matrix form , @xmath98 . for any type of kink in the model",
    ", there is at least one element @xmath99 of the diagonal of the field matrix that changes sign as one crosses the defect core @xcite . in the particular case of the lowest energy kinks , those described by the charge matrices",
    "@xmath52 , it is easy to see that only one of the @xmath99 s changes sign . for these cases ,",
    "@xmath100 $ ] also vanishes at the defect s core .",
    "since this does not happen for any of the other kink types , we have a way of distinguishing between the least energetic kinks and general unstable ones",
    ". we thus measure at each time step the total number of zero crossings between all adjacent lattice points , of both the @xmath99 s and of @xmath100 $ ] . for most of the evolution the network",
    "consists predominantly of stable kinks and the two quantities coincide , defining the total wall length in the system .",
    "the simulations follow the same pattern as before , starting with a thermalization stage after which the stochastic term in the equation of motion is set to zero . in this case",
    ", however we are interested in studying the long time scaling behaviour of the network .",
    "since we are mostly concerned with the relativistic limit of the theory the dissipation term must be set to zero during the scaling period .",
    "nevertheless , since the initial thermal configuration is very energetic , we keep the dissipation high for some time after the quench , before setting @xmath101 for the scaling regime . in this way ,",
    "some of the excess energy is dissipated away , allowing the fields to relax into a well formed network configuration that then can start scaling .    in all simulations , the model parameters and space and time discretization steps used",
    "were the same as in the one dimensional runs .",
    "the fields were evolved in a @xmath102 point grid .    in fig .",
    "[ network1 ] we can see a snapshot of the wall network for an early time in the scaling period , @xmath103 .",
    "the network is very dense with a very high number of intersections .",
    "the walls were identified using the method discussed above . at this time",
    "all the kinks in the network are stable and the number of zero crossings for the @xmath99 s and for @xmath100 $ ] coincide . by direct observation of the field configurations , we confirmed that higher energy kinks do exist for earlier times which quickly decay into stable ones .",
    "a secondary consequence of such decay processes is that stable kinks forming in pairs from a single unstable kink tend to remain spatially correlated near junctions .",
    "since the repulsive force between kinks is exponentially small , this pairing is relatively stable and can be observed for considerably late times ( see fig .",
    "[ network2 ] ) .    for later times",
    "most walls annihilate , loops form and decay into radiation and the overall density decreases .",
    "walls tend to get straighter as this is energetically more favourable , though the time - scale relevant for this process is clearly larger than the decay time of the network . in fig .",
    "[ network2 ] we show the network for a later time , @xmath104 .",
    "the reduction in density is remarkable , with only a small number of intersecting walls remaining . the way these intersect to form nodes is quite interesting and we can see in particular that around each node there are always six incoming walls",
    "this is related to the fact that the minimal periodic wall lattice is composed of six walls , as discussed in section  [ model ] .",
    "it is clear that for such a configuration to be stable for very long times , the walls around the node must repel each other .",
    "hence the sequence of their charges must correspond to a stable wall lattice pattern . for earlier times",
    "we observe nodes with other numbers of incoming walls , though , as expected , never less than six .",
    "high index nodes are rarer because they are both less likely to form and more likely to cancel with other nodes to form a minimal six wall configuration . eventually all nodes annihilate with anti - nodes with reversed `` vacuum orientation '' , and for very long times all walls disappear . in all the simulations performed in a square lattice ,",
    "the final state always had zero wall content and a two dimensional wall lattice never formed .",
    "nevertheless , we observed that by taking one of the linear dimensions of the simulation domain @xmath105 to be smaller than the other @xmath106 , a regular lattice of straight parallel walls can be obtained as the outcome of the evolution .",
    "though more careful simulations need to be performed , our preliminary results suggest that as the smaller grid dimension increases , the final density of walls in the lattice becomes smaller .",
    "when @xmath107 , the ratio of the two dimensions becomes larger than roughly @xmath108 , no lattice is formed .",
    "this result can be better understood by imagining the limit when one of the torus dimensions ( say @xmath105 ) goes to zero and the 1d case is recovered . in this situation , the final state of the evolution should be a series of parallel walls crossing the torus in the @xmath109-direction .",
    "as @xmath105 increases , we can expected that some of these walls will be able to `` explore '' the torus in both the @xmath110 and @xmath109-directions .",
    "some of these will not cross the torus , getting linked to other walls and forming a complex network . as the network evolves",
    ", wall nodes will annihilate , some of these annihilations further decreasing the number of walls that cross the box in the @xmath109-direction . as a result",
    ", the final state of the system will still be a set of straight repelling parallel walls in the @xmath109-direction , but with a lower density .",
    "it is easy to imagine that as @xmath105 increases and approaches @xmath106 , the final density will decrease , up to the point where no lattice will form at all .",
    "the fact that the final state of the transition depends on the geometry of the system is unexpected and may have implications in cosmological settings in models with extra dimensions .",
    "still , a better understanding of this phenomenon and the mechanisms behind it is needed before further conclusions can be drawn .",
    "another indication that the dynamics of this system differs fundamentaly from regular defect networks can be obtained by studying its scaling properties . in fig .",
    "[ scalling ] we show a @xmath111 plot of the total wall length versus time . for comparison",
    "we also include a plot of the scaling of a regular @xmath4 domain wall network .",
    "this was obtained by evolving a scalar @xmath6 theory in parallel with the @xmath0 system . in both cases after the initial thermalization and dissipation periods , the domain wall network enters a scaling regime where the time evolution of the total wall length is well described by a power - law @xmath112 . for the @xmath4 theory",
    "we find @xmath113 which is in reasonable agreement with both previous theoretical and numerical predictions of @xmath114 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . this is to be compared with the result for the @xmath0 walls . in this case",
    "we find @xmath115 , a considerably lower result .",
    "clearly , the dynamics of the @xmath0 network is fundamentally different from the @xmath4 case .",
    "this is not surprising , taking into account that the process of node / anti - node annihilation must play an important role in the dynamics of the system . that the overall effect is a slowdown in the scaling",
    ", could also be expected on the basis that the six - wall junctions feel a force that is predominantly isotropic .",
    "this suggests that systems allowing for stable nodes with higher number of crossing walls and hence more isotropic , would be likely to display even lower scaling powers . in the limit of infinite number of incoming walls per node",
    "the system would eventually become static .",
    "we have numerically studied phase transitions in a model with @xmath0 symmetry breaking down to @xmath1 in one and two spatial dimensions . in one dimension ,",
    "as expected , we find that a stable domain wall lattice forms . in two dimension",
    ", we observed the formation of a complicated network of domain walls and domain wall junctions . at every",
    "junction six domain walls are present . with time , the junctions move and annihilate , and the network coarsens .",
    "this feature of the network dynamics leads to a slowdown of the scaling regime .",
    "we found that the total length of domain wall in the network scales as @xmath2 , in contrast to the @xmath116 fall off expected for @xmath4 domain walls in a @xmath6 model .",
    "we have not studied the phase transition in three dimensions since the problem then becomes computationally very intensive .",
    "even then our results can be extrapolated to three dimensions , allowing us to anticipate certain behavior . in three dimensions",
    "we expect the wall junctions to be one dimensional  somewhat like strings .",
    "the network of walls will coarsen as the strings come together and annihilate .",
    "this is very reminiscent of a system of cosmic strings in which each string then gets connected to six domain walls and the evolution of the networks should be similar @xcite .",
    "the new feature in the present case is the repulsion between walls and antiwalls and this could lead to lattice formation at very late times .",
    "perhaps the most important application of our study is to the @xmath5 case as this is a realistic particle physics model . as we have noted in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the domain walls in the @xmath17 model are identical to those in the @xmath79 model .",
    "the difference is only in their stability properties .",
    "hence we might expect some of the features of the domain wall networks in the @xmath79 case to carry over to the @xmath17 case .",
