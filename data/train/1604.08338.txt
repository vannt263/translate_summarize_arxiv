    "the mathematical foundations of the theory of brittle fracture were laid by the work of a. griffith @xcite in the 1920s .",
    "the fundamental idea is that the formation of cracks may be seen as the result of the competition between the elastic bulk energy of the body and the work needed to produce a new crack .",
    "this latter is modeled as a surface energy , which , in its simplest form , is proportional to the surface measure of the crack via a material constant , called the _ toughness _ of the material .",
    "the rigorous mathematical formulation of the problem , introduced in @xcite , requires that the function @xmath1 , associating to each time @xmath2 a deformation @xmath3 of the reference configuration and a crack set @xmath4 , is a quasistatic evolution satisfying the following conditions :    * \\(a ) static equilibrium : for every @xmath2 the pair @xmath5 minimizes the energy at time @xmath2 among all admissible competitors ; * \\(b ) irreversibility : @xmath6 is contained in @xmath4 for @xmath7 ; * \\(c ) nondissipativity : the derivative of the internal energy equals the power of the applied forces .",
    "remarkable features of this approach are that it is able to show crack initation , as well as a discontinuous evolution of the crack path , which _ needs not to be a priori prescribed_. on the other hand , establishing a rigorous mathematical framework for the existence of a continuous - time evolution has proved to be quite a hard task .",
    "the first breakthrough results in this direction are the ones in @xcite and @xcite tackling in a _ planar setting _ the case of anti - plane shear and linearized elasticity , respectively . the evolution is driven by a given prescribed load @xmath8 on a dirichlet part @xmath9 of the boundary of the reference configuration @xmath10 .",
    "namely , in the case considered in @xcite , the energy associated to a displacement @xmath11 and a crack @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a quadratic form acting on the symmetrized gradient @xmath15 .",
    "at each time @xmath2 , the deformation @xmath3 , which fulfills the boundary condition @xmath16 on @xmath17 has to satisfy the minimality property @xmath18 for all @xmath19 and all @xmath20 with @xmath21 on @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 is the space of displacements with square - integrable strains .",
    "the existence of an evolution is proved by following the natural idea , in the context of quasistatic brittle fracture , of starting with a time - discretized evolution , and then letting the time - step go to @xmath24 .",
    "namely , for a given time step @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the pair @xmath27 is inductively defined as a solution for the problem @xmath28 among all cracks @xmath29 and displacements @xmath30 with @xmath31 on @xmath22 .",
    "notice that the existence for the above minimum problems can be proved under the _ additional restriction _ that the admissible cracks have _ at most a fixed number _ of connected components .",
    "indeed , in this case the direct method proves succesful : crack sets are compact and lower semicontinuous with respect to the hausdorff topology of sets via goab s theorem ( see @xcite ) , while compactness of the displacements is recovered via the poincar - korn inequality , upon noticing that the energy stays invariant under subtraction of rigid movements in the connected components of @xmath32 whose boundary has no intersection with @xmath22 .",
    "the aforementioned important restriction plays furthermore a fundamental role in overcoming a stability issue , which arises when taking the limit for a time step @xmath33 going to @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , if this hypothesis is dropped , the convergence in the hausdorff metric of the approximating cracks @xmath34 ( obtained as piecewise constant interpolations of @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) to a set @xmath4 does not imply that piecewise constant interpolations of the time - discretized displacements @xmath37 converge to a solution of the minimum problem .",
    "this issue , which is due to a _ neumann - sieve - type _ phenomenon ( see @xcite ) , can be overcome in a planar setting imposing an a - priori bound on the connected components of the cracks and using some results from the analysis of neumann problems in varying domains , contained in @xcite .    to avoid this restriction ,",
    "a different and more powerful approach has been proposed in @xcite , and succesfully applied to the case of _ anti - plane shear _ in arbitrary dimension @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", the reference configuration is an infinite cylinder @xmath39 with @xmath40 open and bounded , and admissible displacements are of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 varies in @xmath10 and the only nonzero component @xmath43 is scalar - valued . in this case , the linear elastic energy reduces to the dirichlet energy @xmath44 and the incremental minimum problems become very similar to the strong formulation of the mumford - shah functional in image segmentation proposed in @xcite .",
    "inspired by de giorgi s weak formulation in the space of special functions of bounded variation @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) , the authors model crack sets as ( union of ) jump sets of admissible displacements .",
    "the minimum problems to be solved at every time step essentially reduce ( up to some modifications in order to allow for cracks running alongside the boundary ) to @xmath46 with @xmath47 denoting the jump set of @xmath11 , among all displacement satisfying @xmath31 on @xmath9 .",
    "provided one assumes an @xmath48 bound on the boundary datum , the maximum principle and ambrosio s compactness theorem in @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) ensure well - posedness for the above problem .",
    "if @xmath11 is a solution thereof , the crack set is then updated by setting @xmath50 .",
    "a key tool introduced in the paper @xcite in order to deal with the above mentioned stability issues , when the time step @xmath33 tends to @xmath24 , is the so - called _ jump transfer lemma_. it allows to transer most of the jump set of any function in @xmath49 that lies inside of the jump set of a function @xmath11 onto that of @xmath51 , if @xmath51 is a sequence in @xmath49 weakly converging to @xmath11 .",
    "as a consequence of this lemma , the authors are able to recover a weak form of in the limit .",
    "the existence result has been later generalized to finite hyperelastic energies and vector - valued deformations in @xcite , whereas the existence of a weak quasistatic evolution for the fully linear elastic model has remained an open issue , due to at least two major difficulties .      as a first point , even in the static setting the existence of minimizers for the weak formulation",
    "is not clear .",
    "a natural attempt of generalising consists indeed in considering problems of the type @xmath52 under some prescribed boundary condition @xmath53 , in the space @xmath54 of special functions of bounded deformation ( see @xcite ) , for which a symmetrized gradient and an @xmath55-rectifiable jump set are well defined .",
    "however , weak sequential compactness in @xmath54 requires ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) ) a uniform bound on the @xmath48 norm of the sequence , similarly to the @xmath49-case , which in this setting is not guaranteed along a minimizing sequence , due to the lack of a maximum principle .",
    "the addition of lower order terms , related for instance to the action of bulk forces , can at least provide some uniform bound on the @xmath56 norm of the minimizing sequences , so that , mimicking a succesful approach to similar problems in spaces of functions of bounded variation , one can recover an existence result in the space @xmath0 of _ generalized special functions of bounded deformation_. a correct definition of this space and the investigation of the related compactness and lower semicontinuity properties have proved to be a quite delicate issue , which has been overcome only recently in the paper @xcite . on the other hand , it would be highly desirable to have an existence result also for the model without the addition of lower order terms .",
    "this requires a suitable korn - type inequality in @xmath0 to be available , allowing in some sense to reproduce the steps of the existence proof for in a weak setting .",
    "the other major issue to be faced in order to give an existence proof of a quasistatic evolution with values in @xmath0 is the generalisation of the jump transfer lemma to this setting .",
    "actually , the proof strategy devised in @xcite can not be straightforwardly reproduced in this context .",
    "indeed , there the jump set @xmath47 is written as a countable union of pairwise intersections of level sets of @xmath11 .",
    "the parts of the corresponding level sets for @xmath51 lying outside @xmath57 are then shown to have small length . with this",
    ", one can transer onto pieces of these sets the jump @xmath58 for a given competitor @xmath59 . in this procedure ,",
    "the _ coarea formula _ and the equiintegrability of @xmath60 play a crucial role . in the framework of linearized elasticity",
    ", however , only an a - priori control on the symmetrized gradient is available . again , being able to estimate gradients in terms of their symmetrized part via a korn - type inequality would remove parts of these obstacles and be a good starting point for proving an analog of the lemma in the @xmath0 setting .",
    "this preliminary discussion leads us to the purpose of the present paper .",
    "our goal is to provide an existence result , in dimension @xmath61 , for quasistatic crack growth in the sense of griffith in a linearly elastic material . in theorem",
    "[ th : main ] we show the existence of a pair @xmath5 , with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath4 nondecreasing in time , such that @xmath3 minimizes @xmath64 among all @xmath65 satisfying the prescribed time - dependent dirichlet condition @xmath8 , and the total energy satisfies the energy - dissipation balance @xmath66 in the above equality @xmath67 is the elastic tensor generating the quadratic form @xmath14 , so that the integral term can be interpreted as the virtual work of the applied boundary load .",
    "we also mention that , as it is typical of variational problems in spaces of functions of bounded deformation , the boundary condition has to be understood in a relaxed sense ( see section [ sec : general ] for details ) .",
    "a starting point for our proof strategy is the use of a piecewise korn inequality for @xmath0 functions , proved in the planar setting in @xcite , extending other recent results in the literature ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.2 ) ) .",
    "for every @xmath68 it allows to control the @xmath56-norm of a displacement and its gradient in terms of the square norm of the symmetrized gradient , provided a suitable piecewise infinitesimal rigid motion is subtracted . with this construction",
    "the jump set is enlarged , but still controlled by the length of the original jump set .",
    "a major ingredient is then a sharp version of the piecewise korn inequality proved in theorem [ th : kornpoin - sharp ] .",
    "we show that the jump set can even only be enlarged by a small length at the prize of having only an @xmath69-control on the gradient .",
    "this control , however , involves constants which behave well with respect to scaling and particularly are small on small squares ( see remark [ rem : square ] ) .    equipped with this result , we can prove theorem [ th : approx ] , where , up to an arbitrarily small error @xmath70 , the jump set of a weakly compact sequence @xmath71 in @xmath0 is shown to coincide with the one of a sequence @xmath72 of @xmath49 functions , still @xmath69-converging to @xmath11 up to some small exceptional sets .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath69-norm of @xmath73 is uniformly small in a tubular neighborhood of the jump set @xmath47 .",
    "notice that the construction of @xmath74 is quite involved and depends on the given covering of @xmath47 ( see section [ sec : jump ] for details ) .",
    "this allows to prove a jump transfer lemma also in this setting ( theorem [ th : jtransf ] ) , adapting the arguments of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "the reflection procedure that the authors use there in order to define the sequence @xmath75 corresponding to the competitor @xmath59 , which is not compatible with a control only on the symmetrized gradient @xmath76 , is here replaced by a suitable generalization introduced in @xcite and adjusted to our purposes in lemma [ lemma : nitsche ] .",
    "the existence proof for the minimum problem requires an additional step , namely a version of the sharp piecewise korn inequality proved in theorem [ th : kornpoin - sharp ] which also takes into account the relaxed boundary conditions .",
    "this is proved in theorem [ th : korn - boundary ] . with this",
    ", we can derive a general compactness result for minimizing sequences of the energy drawing some ideas from @xcite : while typically sequences are not compact , it is always possible to pass to modifications by subtracting suitable piecewise infinitesimal rigid motions ( which do not change the elastic part of the energy ) at the expense of arbitrarily small additional fracture energy .",
    "this allows us to construct a minimizing sequence @xmath77 which satisfies the uniform bound @xmath78 for an increasing , continuous functions @xmath79 with @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "this bound , in general weaker than any @xmath56-bound , is enough to apply the compactness result in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.3 ) deducing the existence of a minimizer ( see theorem [ th : comp ] and theorem [ th : existence ] below ) .",
    "an additional delicate point of the proof is showing that the function @xmath82 is only depending on the reference configuration @xmath10 and the @xmath83 norm of the boundary displacement @xmath8 , so that , under the usual regularity assumptions on the boundary load , it is independent from the time @xmath2 along an evolution .",
    "this is crucial in the proof of theorem [ th : extension ] where the global stability property is derived .",
    "once this two major hurdles have been fixed , the by now well - known machinery succesfully exploited in @xcite and in @xcite , in the linear antiplane and in the finite elastic context , respectively , can be adapted to our setting with minor modifications , which we however detail to some extent in section [ se : exist result ] .",
    "this leads to the proof of our main result stated in theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "as already mentioned , we establish the result only in two dimensions as we make a heavy use of the piecewise korn inequality of @xcite which has been only derived in a planar setting due to technical difficulties , concerning the topological structure of crack geometries in higher dimensions .",
    "additionally , also its generalisation to the sharp version ( theorem [ th : kornpoin - sharp ] ) and the case of prescribed boundary conditions ( theorem [ th : korn - boundary ] ) makes use of estimates holding in a planar setting ( see lemma [ lemma : rigid motion ] , lemma [ lemma : interface ] , and lemma [ lemma : maggi ] ) . without these restrictions ,",
    "the methods we use actually hold in any dimension .",
    "we therefore believe that our results can be extended to the @xmath38-dimensional case and that the proof provides the principal techniques being necessary to establish the result in arbitrary space dimension .",
    "in this section we introduce basic definitions and the function spaces which we will use in the paper .",
    "moreover , we recall a piecewise korn inequality for @xmath0 functions proved in @xcite .      for a bounded , measurable set @xmath84",
    "we define @xmath85 the above definition is independent of the particular lebesgue representative .",
