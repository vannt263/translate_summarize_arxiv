    "an extended structure is , of course , hard to distinguish from yet another configuration where the mm galaxy is part of an interacting system or group with other , possibly optically more visible , galaxies present nearby at the same redshift .    unlike some other fields targeted by deep surveys , the ndf is not centered on a massive moderate redshift cluster that provides amplification by gravitational lensing .",

    "* ) and the statistical analysis on the basis of the submm / radio redshift indicator @xcite both are consistent with that notion .",
    "progress has been limited , however , by ( 1 ) the small number of reliable individual identifications , ( 2 ) the flattening and scatter of the submm / radio redshift indicator which makes estimates at redshifts above 2 fairly uncertain , and ( 3 ) the lack of observed far - infrared to mm seds , which can help breaking the high redshift degeneracy of the submm / radio redshift estimator by adding information on the location of the rest frame far - infrared dust peak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we restrict radio identification here to sources well detected in the ( sub)mm , in order to limit contamination by galaxies with ( sub)mm fluxes that are highly uncertain because of malmquist bias in the ( sub)mm surveys .",
    "we do not consider objects from radio - preselected surveys @xcite . while such surveys efficiently locate a major part of the ( sub)mm galaxy population , they will be biased in redshift distribution and thus the optical / near - ir properties of counterparts .",
    "table  [ tab : litsample ] summarizes the properties of the 14 objects meeting our selection criteria . by nature , this ` reliable ' sample from the literature emphasizes the bright and luminous end of the ( sub)mm galaxy population , but is not a complete sample with strict selection criteria .",

    "they find that @xmath360% of submm galaxies are class 0 .",
    "the small difference between our findings and those of @xcite could be due to the small ( though partly overlapping ) samples , the less strict k - band limit for their class 0 ( k=21 ) than adopted here ( k=22 ) , and some of the @xcite class 0 objects being of lower reliability in the original scuba maps",
    ". it would be premature to interpret this modest variation already in terms of our sample including only the most luminous objects , or in terms of mm selection vs. submm selection .",
    "moreover , @xcite , find an indication from a sample of lensed scuba sources that the faint ( sub)mm galaxies ( s@xmath354mjy ) have a higher fraction of k - band blank fields than the brighter ( sub)mm sources .",
    "our observations , however , argue against such a trend .",
    "our sources , which are likely to be non - lensed , are among the very brightest ( sub)mm sources if amplification is taken into account ( table  [ tab : litsample ] ) .",
    "this implies that a major fraction of ( sub)mm sources , both `` bright '' and `` faint '' , are beyond the reach of optical and near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite suggested that most of the galaxies forming the 850@xmath24 m cosmic background should be easily detectable in the rest - frame uv .",

    "if those were easily detectable in the uv , however , the fainter and brighter ( sub)mm objects could no longer be linked as suggested by @xcite , i.e. through a strong correlation between dust opacity and star - formation rate , but with the uv luminosity of all objects being fairly similar irrespective of star - formation rate .    in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts for most objects ,",
    "correlations between observed properties are useful for constraining the redshift and evolution of submm sources , and their relation to local infrared galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mmcorrs ] shows diagnostic plots using spectral indices and colors derived on the basis of the optical ( i - band ) , near - infrared ( k - band ) , submm , and radio properties of this sample .",
    "we compare these to the indices and colors expected for two local template seds moved to redshifts between 1 and 5 : arp220 as an example of a highly obscured local ultraluminous infrared galaxy and m82 as an example of a less obscured luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) .",
    "the non - detection of many objects in k and , in particular , i makes the two right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mmcorrs ] less constraining on the nature of these sources .",
    "it is clear that some submm galaxies are redder in i - k than m82 placed at any plausible redshift , and one might speculate that the objects undetected in both i and k are similarly red . at least a subset of ( sub)mm galaxies is redder in the rest frame uv / optical / near - ir than a normal dusty starburst like m82 , and is better represented by an arp220like sed .",
    "the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mmcorrs ] combines two spectral indices : on the abscissa the submm / radio spectral index frequently used as a redshift indicator , and a spectral index between observed k - band and 850@xmath24 m , i.e. , rest frame optical and submm .",
    "the rest frame optical emission of the observed ( sub)mm sources is very weak compared to the submm / far - infrared one , clearly requiring a high dust content .",
    "even a local dusty starburst like m82 is not obscured enough to represent the majority of ( sub)mm objects .",
    "a highly obscured ulirg like arp220 provides a better fit , but on average the obscuration of ( sub)mm objects may be yet larger ( see also sect .  [",
    "sect : arethesez3 ] ) .",
    "a trend is seen between the two indices whereby the sources with the steepest 850@xmath24 m to 1.4ghz spectral indices also tend to be the sources with the steepest 2.2@xmath24 m to 850@xmath24 m spectral indices .",
    "this indicates , as perhaps expected , that the k - band to submm index significantly depends on redshift because of the widely differing k - corrections at its defining frequencies , and that variations in source properties do not fully overwhelm this effect .",
    "interestingly , the objects that are blank fields down to very faint k magnitudes all cluster in the ( lower ) right of this diagram , i.e. where the radio to submm redshift indicator puts them at the higher end of the redshift spread of ( sub)mm galaxies .",
    "this result is most simply explained by one of the two explanations for k - band blank fields put forward in the previous section : most plausibly these are the highest redshift objects .",
    "the submm / radio redshift indicator is unfortunately not accurate enough to assign good redshifts , but distinguishes the k - band faint objects from the rest of the population . if they were yet more extremely obscured objects than ulirgs but with a redshift range similar to the other sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmcorrs ] , the scatter across the lower half of the diagram would likely be greater than observed . moreover",
    ", having a significant fraction of ( sub)mm sources at high redshift apparently does not violate any constraint from the sed of the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the relative contribution of objects with spectral energy distributions like local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies to the cirb at high redshifts ( z@xmath14 ) can be quite significant ( @xmath3820 - 40% ) without violating any constraints provided by its spectrum .",
    "all galaxies detected in ( sub)mm surveys , except perhaps for a few of the very highest redshift ones , will be observed on the long wavelength side of their rest frame far - infrared emission maximum , while local comparison objects were selected by iras near the maximum or slightly to its short wavelength side .",
    "this situation can induce a bias , favoring detection of objects with somewhat colder dust in the ( sub)mm surveys .",
    "trying to match the observed number counts , cosmological simulations by @xcite invoke colder seds more similar to local luminous infrared galaxies @xcite rather than the warmer seds of local ulirgs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . keeping the observed ( sub)mm flux fixed",
    ", a colder sed will result in a lower redshift and/or less luminous object .",
    "the additional optical / near - infrared and radio constraints can test the plausibility of these assumptions . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dunnecorrs ] , we show where the colder ( t@xmath1835k ) among the local galaxies observed by @xcite would be placed for several redshifts on a diagram combining near - infrared / submm and submm / radio spectral indices , as already shown for the ( sub)mm sources in fig .  [",
    "fig : mmcorrs ] .",
    "clearly those colder lirg - like seds predict k - band magnitudes that are too bright and are not consistent with the results for the ( sub)mm galaxies .",
    "the scenario of @xcite where the seds of submm galaxies are closer to the cooler lirgs studied by dunne et al . rather than the ulirgs adopted by other workers is , hence , inconsistent with the overall sed information including the observed near - infrared ( rest frame optical ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the lower luminosity and colder objects in the local universe having a higher relative fraction of optical to infrared luminosity . suppressing the k - band emission observed at higher redshift for",
    "such seds to the required level would require that the ( sub)mm galaxies are at even higher redshifts than discussed above .",
    "if the rest frame far - infrared seds of ( sub)mm galaxies are cool , their overall seds still must be distinct from local universe cold lirgs in having a much stronger ulirg - like obscuration of optical emission .",
    "such galaxies - without analogs in the local universe - could be envisaged as a collection of the ` coldest ' and most obscured star forming regions like sgrb2 , without admixture of the warmer and less obscured regions normally representing other evolutionary stages of star forming complexes .",
    "alternatively , they could be modelled as dilute obscured ` cirrus'-type systems ( efstathiou & rowan - robinson , in preparation ) , but only with the stringent assumption of constant optical depth dust enclosing the entire large region .",
    "we have discussed two possibilities for the nature of bright ( sub)mm sources that are very faint in the near - infrared ( k@xmath222 ) .",
    "they are either heavily obscured starbursts / agn  in this context more heavily obscured than any well - studied local starbursts or qsos  or are , as suggested by the analysis given in the previous section , similar to low redshift dusty powerful starbursts but located at very high redshifts ( z@xmath24 ) . in either case , several important inferences can be drawn .    in the local ulirg population ,",
    "the amount of uv light observed , even if corrected for extinction , traces only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath3410% ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that most of the intrinsic uv emission is not detected in ulirgs but is completely obscured .",
    "the observed uv emission simply can not be related to the sites where most of the bolometric luminosity is produced . to make the rest - frame",
    "uv / optical to far - infrared sed even redder than the most highly reddened galaxies in the local universe would require special circumstances in order to lower the ratio of optically visible to total luminosity yet further .",
    "one such special circumstance is an extremely young starburst which is completely obscured in all directions . to maintain heavy obscuration the starburst must be younger than the time necessary for significant gas removal due to the feedback from stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "this timescale is at most a few @xmath15 10@xmath39 years and likely significantly less @xcite .",
    "otherwise , in a second special case , the gas accretion rate and timescale must be such that as the feedback clears regions of young or intermediate age stars , there would be inflowing gas available to maintain the overall obscuration . maintaining",
    "such extremely high obscuration would require gas with substantial amounts of dust to fall onto the region of intense star - formation and have a distribution such that there are very few regions of low optical depth in the rest - frame uv .",
    "in addition , such vigorous infall must be maintained for at least the gas clearance time scale and likely much longer .",
    "a third possibility would be to invoke a large scale but still very thick and non - starforming cocoon around the star forming zone , delaying destruction by gas removal but putting strong requirements on size and uniformity of such a cocoon .",
    "the other plausible scenario for the nature of these bright ( sub)mm sources is that their seds are similar to the most obscured local dusty starbursts but are at extremely high redshift ( z@xmath24 ) .",
    "it is now well - understood that local ulirgs are a result of the interaction or merger of two gas rich spiral galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "continuing this analogy of ( sub)mm sources being high redshift galaxies with extremely high star - formation rates and seds that are ulirg - like would then suggest that they too are the merger of massive disk galaxies .",
    "higher gas fractions in high redshift galaxies may support such a process .",
    "the main implication of this scenario is the need to have massive units in place for the z@xmath14 merger , gas - rich enough to sustain star formation rates of the order 1000m@xmath40 yr@xmath7 and provide the material obscuring this burst .    in either event ,",
    "the implications for our understanding of the formation of spheroids is interesting .",
    "requiring extremely high obscuration to explain the properties of the brightest mm sources is consistent with a model whereby spheroids are formed through a process similar to the `` monolithic collapse '' model .",
    "that is , through the rapid collapse of large amounts of gas which is maintained over several to many dynamical time scales ( of - order 100 myrs ",
    "1 gyr ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a model like this has the attractive feature of being able to supply the gas necessary to both maintain the high uv extinction and the large fraction of the total bolometric luminosity that must be emitted in the infrared / submm . if , on the other hand , the seds of the mm sources are similar to the local ulirgs",
    ", then the problem is that at z=4 ( the low end of possible redshifts for these sources , see fig .",
    "3 ) , the age of the universe is only about 1.5 gyr or about 11% of its current age . within the context of the popular hierarchical merging models ,",
    "this time is too short to form massive metal - rich disks for the necessary merging to take place ( see * ? ? ?",
    "hierarchical merging models simply have great difficulty in producing the high rates of star - formation which these galaxies likely have at such high redshifts .",
    "for example , in the results of the simulation by @xcite , the sources that can be identified with the faint submm population ( s@xmath41 @xmath42 1 mjy ) are found to redshifts of about 13 with no sources at z@xmath24 obtaining a large enough luminosity sufficient to be detected at the fluxes of the source investigated here . in both models , merging and `` monolithic collapse '' , prompt metal enrichment may also be necessary to create sufficient amounts of dust to effectively allow for the virtually complete re - emission of the bolometric luminosity into the infrared / submm .",
    "we have used mm and radio interferometry to locate accurately three of the brightest and likely non - lensed mambo mm sources  mmj120546 - 0741.5 , mmj120539 - 0745.4 , and mmj120517 - 0743.1 .",
    "these objects are among the very brightest ( sub)mm galaxies if amplification is taken into account .",
    "associated deep optical and k - band follow - up shows that these sources do not have optical or near - infrared counterparts down to very faint magnitudes ( k@xmath26@xmath121.9 ) .",
    "the near - infrared faintness of these bright mm galaxies implies that they must either be at very high redshift ( z@xmath24 ) or more highly obscured than even the dustiest local ulirgs .",
    "we have combined these limits with results from the literature for those among the brightest ( sub)mm sources that we consider located reliably to subarcsecond accuracy . about a third each of the total sample",
    "are ( 1 ) detected in the optical with follow - up possibility , ( 2 ) optically faint but detected at k@xmath320 - 21 , and ( 3 ) undetected in k at levels similar to the three mambo galaxies ( k@xmath222 ) .",
    "the combined optical ",
    "near - infrared  submm  radio data for the sample suggest the near - infrared faintness of our objects to be most likely due to very high redshifts and not due to obscuration alone .",
    "the seds of local galaxies that are cool in the far - infrared do not explain the overall characteristics of these galaxies very well and therefore models of this type are not favored on the basis of these data . the nondetection of a major fraction of the ( sub)mm population in the near - infrared and optical stresses the need for future new methods like wideband co searches , mid - infrared emission features , or maser lines in obtaining accurate redshifts for this important group of high redshift objects , in order to understand the ( sub)mm galaxy population as a whole .",
    "the existence of a sizeable fraction of k - band faint ( sub)mm galaxies has implications for our understanding of the formation of galaxies .",
    "specifically , such results will test whether the faint mm population is similar to the merger - induced dusty powerful starbursts in the local universe , or if they represent something more extreme ",
    "e.g. , the `` monolithic collapse '' of massive spheroids .",
    "if the brightest mm sources lie mostly at high redshift ( z@xmath24 ) and have extreme luminosities ( l@xmath43@xmath1 few @xmath15 10@xmath44 l@xmath6 ) , then hierarchical merging models will have difficulty in explaining these sources within the general context of galaxy formation and evolution . as such , these bright source may provide a critical test of these widely favored models .",
