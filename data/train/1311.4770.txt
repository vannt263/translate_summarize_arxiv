    "there has been a recent interest in the links between finsler geometry and the geometry of relativistic spacetimes .",
    "a well - known reason comes from the viewpoint of applicability : finsler metrics are much more general than riemannian ones and , accordingly , if one replaces the lorentz metric of a spacetime by a finslerian counterpart , the possibility to model physical effects is richer .",
    "a more practical reason comes from a purely mathematical correspondence : the geometry of a concrete class of finsler manifolds ( randers spaces ) is closely related to the conformal structure of a class of spacetimes ( standard stationary ones ) .",
    "so , results in one of these two fields can be translated into results on the other one and , sometimes , this can be generalized to more general finsler and lorentz spaces .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a brief revision of this topic , emphasizing the applications to physics .    after some preliminary definitions and motivations on finsler metrics ( section [ s2 ] ) , we focus on the problem of describing spacetimes by using finsler elements ( section [ s3 ] ) .",
    "we introduce and discuss a notion of lorentz - finsler metric which leads to _ ( conic ) finsler spacetimes_. our definition is quite general and , so , several previous notions in the literature fit in it .",
    "such a finsler spacetime provides a _ cone structure_. this notion has been studied systematically very recently @xcite , and it allows us to introduce classical causality in the framework of finsler spacetimes .",
    "in particular , some of the key results on this topic can be recovered , theorem [ tfs ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out : ( a ) the cone structure of a finsler spacetime generalizes the one provided by the chronological futures of a classical spacetime , and defines implicitly a past cone structure ( but no further assumption on reversibility should be necessary if one liked to include in the definition of conic finsler spacetime the two cones at each point ) , and ( b ) in classical spacetimes , the cone structure is equivalent to the conformal one , but in finsler spacetimes many non - conformally related lorentz finsler metrics will have the same cone structure and , thus , the same causality that is , the information of the lorentz - finsler metric not contained in the cone structure is much richer than in classical spacetimes .    in section [ s4 ] , we make a brief survey on the recent developments about the geometric correspondence between standard stationary spacetimes and randers spaces .",
    "we focus in those questions with more clear applications to relativistic spacetimes and , so , topics such as the causal structure of standard stationary spacetimes or the gravitational lensing are emphasized .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "let us introduce the very general notion of ( conic ) pseudo - finsler metric in a manifold @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the tangent bundle of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , the natural projection and @xmath3 , an open subset satisfying that it is conic ( that is , if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then @xmath6 ) , and it projects on all @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) .",
    "we say that a smooth function @xmath8 is a _ ( conic ) pseudo - finsler metric _ if @xmath9 is positive homogeneous of degree 2 , namely , @xmath10 for any @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the fundamental tensor @xmath11 , defined as the hessian of @xmath12 at every @xmath4 , is nondegenerate . in other words ,",
    "given @xmath4 , the bilinear symmetric form in @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 for any @xmath15 , is non - degenerate .    let us remark that classical finsler metrics are a particular case of pseudo - finsler metrics .",
    "more specifically , @xmath9 is a finsler metric if @xmath16 and the fundamental tensor @xmath11 is positive definite for every @xmath4 . in this case , @xmath9 is always positive , since by homogeneity @xmath17 for every @xmath4 and we can consider @xmath18 , which is positive homogeneous of degree one . the function @xmath19 is usually called the finsler metric function , and it is determined by its _ indicatrix _ , i.e. the set of its unit vectors .    among the most classical examples of finsler metrics",
    ", we will use randers metrics , which are given by @xmath20 for every @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are a riemannian metric and a one - form in @xmath0 respectively .",
    "in fact , the fundamental tensor of @xmath19 is positive definite in @xmath21 if and only if @xmath25 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.17 ) ) ; this restriction is satisfied everywhere if the @xmath23-norm of @xmath24 is smaller than 1 , so defining a randers metric .",
    "these metrics appear naturally in several contexts as in zermelo navigation problem , which aims to describe the trajectories that minimize the time in the presence of a mild wind or current modelled by a vector field @xmath26 .",
    "then , these trajectories are given by geodesics of a randers metric defined as @xmath27 where @xmath21 , @xmath11 is a riemannian metric and @xmath28 in all @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "observe that zermelo metrics are always positive for every @xmath29 and then its fundamental tensor is positive definite . as we will see later , randers metrics also appear naturally associated to stationary spacetimes describing their causal properties ( see section [ s4 ] ) .",
    "other remarkable example is given by matsumoto metric , which describes trajectories minimizing time in the presence of a slope recall that going up is slower than going down .",
    "this metric is defined as @xmath30 for every @xmath21 , and its fundamental tensor is positive definite in @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 ( * ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.15 ) .",
    "therefore , matsumoto metric is properly _ conic _ if this inequality is not satisfied by some @xmath33 .",
    "randers and matsumoto metrics are particular examples of the class of @xmath34-metrics , which are defined as @xmath35 , being @xmath36 an arbitrary non - negative real function ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in classical general relativity , a _ spacetime _ is a ( connected , hausdorff ) @xmath37-manifold @xmath0 endowed with a lorentzian metric @xmath11 and a time orientation , i.e. , a continuous choice of one of the two timelike cones at each point , which will be regarded as _ future - directed_. there are some speculative applications of the replacement of @xmath11 by a ( generalization of a ) finsler metric @xmath19 , as modeling possible anisotropies of the spacetime even at an infinitesimal level , or admitting speeds higher than light . in any case",
    ", the possibility to model a general action functional ( homogeneous of degree two , but not necessarily coming from a quadratic form ) justifies the study of the lorentz - finsler approach .",
    "there are different possibilities in order to define a finsler spacetime .",
    "recall that , for a riemannian metric @xmath38 , the unit vectors constitute the indicatrix of a ( standard ) finsler metric ; in particular , each unit sphere @xmath39 is convex ( as the boundary of the unit ball ) at each point .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath11 is a lorentzian metric , one has to consider the subsets @xmath40 containing , resp .",
    "the spacelike and timelike unit vectors at @xmath41 .",
    "notice that @xmath42 always contains two connected parts , each one _ concave_. for @xmath43 these properties also hold for @xmath44 , but for higher dimensions @xmath44 is connected and , at each point @xmath41 , its second fundamental form ( say , with respect to any auxiliary euclidean product at @xmath45 ) has lorentzian signature . from the physical viewpoint ,",
    "the most important elements of the spacetime are the causal vectors of the metric , since they model the trajectories of massive and massless particles .",
    "observe in particular that the length of a causal curve @xmath46\\rightarrow m$ ] in the spacetime is computed as @xmath47 and a fundamental property in the spacetime is that causal geodesics locally maximize this length .",
    "if we want to define a more general way of measuring the length of curves ( but preserving that the length does not depend on the parametrization of the curve and geodesics are local length - maximizers ) , then we must consider a positive one - homogeneous function @xmath48 with fundamental tensor of signature @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this would be enough for timelike curves describing the trajectories of massive particles , but if in addition we want to describe the trajectories of massless particles , we will consider a positive two - homogeneous function @xmath9 , rather than a one - homogeneous function , since for a lorentzian metric @xmath11 , @xmath50 is not smooth when @xmath51 is lightlike . summing up",
    ", we say that a _ ( conic ) finsler spacetime _ is a manifold endowed with a conic pseudo - finsler metric @xmath52 which satisfies the following properties :    * each @xmath53 is convex in @xmath45 ( i.e. , the segment in @xmath45 connecting each two vectors @xmath54 is entirely contained in @xmath55 ) , in particular , each @xmath55 must be strictly included in a half - plane of @xmath45 , * @xmath56 has a smooth boundary in @xmath57 , * the extension of @xmath9 as 0 to the closure @xmath58 of @xmath56 is smooth at @xmath59 ( notice that the extension is always continuous at @xmath60 by homogeneity , and this extension can not be smooth there even for a classical finsler metric , except if it comes from a riemannian metric ) , and * both the fundamental tensor @xmath11 in and its extension to the points in @xmath61 have signature @xmath49 .    for practical purposes , we will consider always that @xmath9 is extended to @xmath58 and @xmath11 to @xmath62 for all @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in order to make computations related to lightlike geodesics",
    ", one can also assume that @xmath9 is smoothly extended ( in a non - unique way ) on a neighborhood of @xmath65 .",
    "we will call @xmath18 the _ lorentz - finsler metric _ ( defined on @xmath58 ) of the finsler spacetime . observe that our notion of finsler spacetime is based on a `` conic '' element which is essentially present in most of previous literature .",
    "in particular :    1 .   in @xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath9 is defined in all @xmath1 and the fundamental tensor is assumed to have signature @xmath49 .",
    "the restriction to one connected component of the subset @xmath66 in every point @xmath63 gives a ( conic ) finsler spacetime as defined here . in @xcite ,",
    "the definition is essentially as in @xcite with the opposite sign of @xmath9 ( and an increasing attention to relax differentiability ) .",
    "the definition in @xcite is somewhat more involved : they introduce an @xmath67-homogeneous function @xmath9 , with @xmath68 endowed with a fundamental tensor of signature one and , then , they associate a homogeneous finsler function @xmath69{l}$ ] .",
    "this allows one to deal with non - differentiability in cases that extend the lightlike vectors in our definition above . in @xcite ,",
    "the author gives a definition analog to ours , but he excludes the conditions on the boundary ( so that one is not worried about lightlike vectors ) .",
    "2 .   lorentz - finsler metrics appear in the context of lorentz violation . here , one starts with a background lorentz - minkowski space , but the movement of particles or waves is governed by a lagrangian with a lorentz - finsler behavior ( see @xcite and references therein ) . under natural hypotheses , the following positively homogeneous function is found in @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the standard metric of minkowski spacetime @xmath72 , @xmath51 is any timelike vector and @xmath73 are two prescribed vector fields in @xmath72 .",
    "the interplay between @xmath19 and the background metric @xmath71 becomes important for physical applications ( for example , the group velocity of propagating waves may exceed the light speed in @xmath72 ) .",
    "even though @xmath19 can be regarded as a lorentz - finsler metric , in some cases the fundamental tensor of @xmath19 may be degenerate on some timelike directions ( when @xmath74 , it is easy to compute the fundamental tensor of @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.17 ) , and this becomes degenerate when @xmath75 ) .",
    "general physical theories of modified gravity ( see @xcite or the very recent articles @xcite and references therein ) yield naturally lorentz - finsler spacetimes as defined above . the exact domain @xmath56 of @xmath9 for general expressions in finsler - cartan gravity ( say , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 2 ) ) ) may be difficult to compute .",
    "however , one can compute @xmath56 easily in _ general very special relativity _ , which possesses a simple finslerian line element introduced by bogoslovsky ( say , the expression @xmath76 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( i.1 ) ) becomes a lorentz - finsler metric with domain @xmath56 equal to the intersection at each point of the future time - cone of @xmath71 and the half - space @xmath77 ) or in randers - type cosmologies as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 3.1 ) ) .    notice that our definition of finsler spacetime is",
    "a generalization of the structure obtained in a classical spacetime when one considers only its _ future causal cones_. in the case of lorentzian metrics , however , the value of the metric on the causal vectors is enough to determine the metric on all the vectors and , moreover , the lightlike vectors are enough to determine the metric up to a conformal factor .",
    "so , the cone structure for lorentzian metrics is equivalent to the conformal structure .",
    "nevertheless , this does not hold by any means in the case of ( conic ) finsler spacetimes : clearly two lorentz finsler metrics @xmath78 on @xmath0 with the same domain @xmath58 may not be equal up to a multiplicative function .",
    "however , the domain @xmath56 is a _ cone structure _ and , thus , one can reconstruct all the causality theory for finsler spacetimes . let us review this briefly .    given a finsler spacetime @xmath79 a tangent vector @xmath21 is called ( future - directed ) timelike if @xmath4 , causal if @xmath80 , lightlike if @xmath81 and null if either @xmath51 is lightlike or the zero vector , and the past directions could be consistently regarded as those in @xmath82 .",
    "it would be natural then to extend @xmath9 to @xmath82 by requiring full homogeneity ( @xmath83 for all @xmath84 ) , but this is not necessary for the issues regarding causality .",
    "however such an extension ( as well as possible further extension of @xmath9 to non - causal vectors ) would be important for the particular physical theory one may be modelling . ] .",
    "a ( piecewise smooth ) curve @xmath85 on @xmath0 is also called timelike , causal etc . depending on the character of its velocity at all the points .",
    "if @xmath86 , we say that @xmath41 lies in the chronological ( resp .",
    "causal ) past of @xmath87 if there exists a ( future - directed ) timelike ( resp .",
    "causal or null ) curve starting at @xmath41 and ending at @xmath87 ; in this case we write @xmath88 ( resp .",
    "@xmath89 ) and we also say that @xmath87 lies in the chronological ( resp .",
    "causal ) future of @xmath41 .",
    "the chronological and causal futures of @xmath41 , as well as its corresponding pasts , are then defined formally as in the case of lorentzian metrics : @xmath90 one says also that a second lorentz finsler metric @xmath91 has cones wider than @xmath19 , denoted @xmath92 when their corresponding domains @xmath93 satisfy @xmath94 . with these definitions",
    ", one can extend directly the _ causal ladder _ of classical spacetimes ( see for example @xcite ) to finsler spacetimes .",
    "we recall some of the steps of this ladder .",
    "a finsler spacetime will be called _ chronological _ ( resp . _",
    "causal _ ) when it does not admit closed timelike ( resp .",
    "causal ) curves , _ stably causal _ when there exists a causal lorentz - lorentz metric @xmath91 with wider cones @xmath92 , and _ globally hyperbolic _ when it is stably causal and the following property holds : @xmath95 is compact for any @xmath86 .",
    "trivially : @xmath96    taking into account the case of spacetimes , one realizes that there are more intermediate levels of the ladder as well as many subtle properties and relations among them to be considered for finsler spacetimes .",
    "however , we focus here just on a pair of them , with deep implications for the global structure . to this aim , we define for a finsler spacetime @xmath79 :    * a _ spacelike hypersurface _ is a smooth hypersurface @xmath97 such that no causal vector @xmath51 is tangent to @xmath97 , * a _ ( spacelike ) cauchy hypersurface _ is a spacelike hypersurface @xmath97 such that any causal curve which is inextendible in a continuous way , intersects @xmath97 exactly once , * a _ temporal function _ is a smooth function @xmath98 such that @xmath99 for all ( future - directed ) causal vector @xmath51 ( thus , its levels @xmath100constant are spacelike hypersurfaces ) and , * a _ cauchy temporal function _ is a temporal function such that all its levels are cauchy hypersurfaces .    in the case of classical spacetimes , results by geroch @xcite and hawking @xcite obtained at a topological level , plus their improvements to the smooth and metric cases by bernal and snchez @xcite , prove the equivalence between being stably causal ( resp , globally hyperbolic ) and admitting a temporal ( resp .",
    "cauchy temporal ) function . by using different arguments coming from kam theory ,",
    "these results were re - proved and extended to general cone structures by fathi and siconolfi @xcite .",
    "so , as a consequence of the latter we get the following result .",
    "[ tfs ] let @xmath101 be a finsler spacetime .",
    "\\(1 ) if @xmath102 is stably causal , then it admits a temporal function ( and , thus , it can be globally foliated by spacelike hypersurfaces ) .",
    "\\(2 ) if @xmath102 is globally hyperbolic , then it admits a cauchy hypersurface and a cauchy temporal function .",
    "recall , however , that the finsler spacetime has elements that are not characterized by the cone structure .",
    "for example , one can define a _ finler separation _",
    "@xmath103 $ ] between any @xmath86 by taking the supremum of the lengths of the ( future - directed ) causal curves from @xmath41 to @xmath87 in a close analogous to the _ lorentzian separation _ or _",
    "distance _ for spacetimes with lorentzian metric .",
    "the analogies and differences of @xmath104 with the lorentzian case ( in particular , its interplay with causality ) deserve to be studied further .",
    "one expects that the converse of parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of theorem [ tfs ] , as well as most of classical causality theory , hold . to achieve this , typical lorentzian techniques , as those regarding limit curves or quasi - limits , must be adapted ( recall the lorentzian proofs of the converse in @xcite , ( *",
    "6.6 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 14.38 , cor . 14.39 ) ) . moreover ,",
    "as the results in @xcite work for very general cone structures , theorem [ tfs ] can be applied to a more general class of spacetimes that includes those in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.3 ) , which can be non - smooth in some timelike directions , and also the cone structure provided by the example ( 2 ) above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "from a classical viewpoint , a correspondence between some purely geometric elements of lorentzian and finslerian manifolds has been developed recently .",
    "such a correspondence provides a precise description of certain objects in ( classical ) spacetimes in terms of an associated finsler space .",
    "the precise correspondence is developed between a particular class of spacetimes , the _ standard complete - conformastationary _ ones , or just _ stationary _ , for short , and a precise class of finsler manifolds , the randers ones ( see ) .",
    "but some consequences and techniques can be extrapolated to general lorentzian and finslerian manifolds .",
    "we start with a trivial observation .",
    "probably the simplest examples of lorentzian manifolds are the products @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the natural projections",
    ". the geometric properties of @xmath108 depend on those of @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , each curve @xmath110 parametrized with unit speed yields naturally two lightlike curves @xmath111 ( future - directed with the sign @xmath112 and past - directed with @xmath113 , for the natural time orientation of the spacetime ) , which are geodesics iff @xmath114 is a geodesic in @xmath115 . a less trivial spacetime is obtained if we admit cross terms between the time and space parts ( independent of the time @xmath98 ) .",
    "this can be described by using a 1-form @xmath116 on @xmath0 , namely , we consider the spacetime : @xmath117 now , we introduce the following finslerian _ fermat metrics _ associated to : @xmath118 notice that these are metrics of randers type , and @xmath119 is the reverse finsler metric of @xmath120 , so , we will write simply @xmath19 for the latter and @xmath121 for the former . if we consider curves @xmath122 and @xmath123 in @xmath0 which are unit for @xmath19 and @xmath121 resp . , the curves in the spacetime @xmath124 are again ( future or past directed ) lightlike curves in @xmath125 , and each one is a geodesic up to parametrization iff so is the corresponding original curve @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( see the details in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of describing the properties related to the causality and conformal structure in in terms of the geometry of the corresponding randers space @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , as only conformally invariant properties will be taken into account , the class of spacetimes to be considered includes those conformal to .",
    "this class of spacetimes can be characterized intrinsically as those which are distinguishing ( a causality condition less restrictive than strong causality ) and admit a complete timelike conformal vector field .",
    "in fact , the conformal change of the metric @xmath11 by @xmath126 , plus the result in @xcite , allows one to find the expression , which defines a _ normalized standard stationary spacetime_. so , one will find a correspondence between the conformal properties of the elements in this class of metrics @xmath127 and the geometric properties of randers spaces @xmath102 .",
    "this has been carried out at different levels ( see @xcite or @xcite for a review ) , and we will focus here in three of them , with clear physical applications .      nicely , fermat metrics allow one to determine the chronological and causal future and past of any point in the stationary spacetime .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath128 then the intersection of @xmath129 with the slice @xmath130 of the spacetime is equal to @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the open ball of center @xmath41 and radius @xmath133 for the fermat metric @xmath134 . from these considerations ,",
    "one can describe in a precise way the causal structure of the spacetime . concretely",
    ", one has @xcite :    [ t1 ] a stationary spacetime is always causally continuous and it is    * causally simple ( i.e. , it is causal , and the causal futures and pasts @xmath135 are closed ) if and only if @xmath102 is convex , i.e. any pair @xmath136 in @xmath0 can be connected by means of an @xmath120-geodesic of length equal to the finslerian distance @xmath137 . *",

    ".    other causal elements which are described naturally with the finslerian elements are the cauchy horizons and developments .",
    "for example , given a subset @xmath139 , its future cauchy horizon @xmath140 is the graph , in @xmath141 of the function which maps each @xmath142 to @xmath143 , i.e. , the @xmath138-distance from the complement of @xmath56 to @xmath144 .    the results in stationary spacetimes can also be translated to results in randers metrics , sometimes generalizable to any finsler manifold . among them",
    ", we point out ( see @xcite ) :    * the theorem above suggests that the compactness of the closed symmetrized balls of @xmath138 , which is a weaker hypothesis than the commonly used ( forward or backward ) completeness of @xmath138 , can substitute the last hypothesis in many results . and",

    "for example , the translation of a well - known result by beem and krolak @xcite yields the following property for any subset @xmath56 of a randers manifold @xmath147 : _",
    "@xmath63 is a differentiable point of the distance from @xmath41 if and only if it can be crossed by exactly one minimizing segment .",

    "we wonder if there exist lightlike geodesics from @xmath149 to @xmath148 ( i.e. , whether an observer at @xmath148 can see the object @xmath149 ) and , in this case , if there are many of such geodesics ( i.e. , the existence of a lens effect such that @xmath149 is seen in two different directions ) .",
    "this situation is applicable to cosmological models such as friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ones , as they are conformally stationary ( @xmath149 would represent a `` comoving observer '' of the model ) .",

    "we recall that , in mathematical relativity , the penrose conformal boundary is commonly used , in spite of the fact that it is not an intrinsic construction , and there are problems to ensure its existence or uniqueness .",
    "the causal boundary is a conformally invariant alternative , which is intrinsic and can be constructed systematically in any strongly causal spacetime ( see @xcite for a comprehensive study of this boundary ) .",
    "the computation of the causal boundary and completion of a stationary spacetime has been carried out in full generality in @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that this boundary has motivated the definition of a new _ busemann boundary _ in any finslerian manifold .",
    "even more , this has stimulated the study of further properties of the gromov boundary in both , riemannian and finlerian manifolds .",
    "it is also worth mentioning two further topics of current interest .",
    "the first one is the correspondence at the level of curvatures between the weyl tensor of the stationary spacetime and the flag curvature of the randers space , see @xcite .",
    "the second one is the possibility to extend the studied correspondence to the case of spacetimes with a nonvasnishing complete killing vector field , whose causal type may change from timelike to lightlike and spacelike .",
    "such metrics are related to a generalization of the zermelo metrics which includes the possibility of a strong wind ( i.e. , with a speed higher than the one which can be reached by the engine of the ship ) , see @xcite .",
    "as a first goal , we have introduced a very general notion of finsler spacetime which includes many previous ones .",
    "this notion emphasizes the role of the cone structure , showing that many properties of ( classical , relativistic ) spacetimes are potentially transplantable to this setting in particular , this holds for a major lorentzian result such as theorem 1 .",
    "remarkably , in relativistic spacetimes the cone structure is equivalent to the conformal structure and , thus , it is governed by the weyl tensor . however , the metrics @xmath170 of two finsler spacetimes with the same cone structure are not by any means necessarily conformal , and one is lead to deal directly with the cone structure .",
    "this cone structure would remain then at a more basic level than any possible weyl - type tensor and , thus , also at a much basic level than the cartan or chern connections ( of course , such connections will be relevant in order to describe concrete physical effects ) .",
    "the importance on the choice of the connection is stressed because a finsler metric admits several associated connections . among them , one has the classical cartan connection , the berwald connection , the chern - rund connection and the hashiguchi connection ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . thus , for example , two finsler metrics with the same chern connection may have different cartan connections . as a consequence ,",
    "the way to describe physical phenomena by using these connections may be non - equivalent and even controversial @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "as emphasized here , all the possible physical causal influences will depend exclusively on the cone structure , at least at a non - quantum level .    as a second goal we have shown a different type of equivalence between the geometry of any randers space and the conformal geometry of classical standard stationary spacetimes .",
    "this equivalence leads to obtain very precise results which relate : ( a ) the properties of distances on the finslerian side with the causality on the side of the spacetime , ( b ) the properties related to finslerian _",
    "convexity _ wth the properties related to relativistic observability and lensing , ( c ) accurate relations between ideal finslerian boundary and the causal boundary ( and , implicitly then , the conformal one ) of spacetimes , or ( d ) interesting relations between finslerian curvature and weyl curvature @xcite .",
    "this equivalence has suggested new results in both , finslerian and lorentzian geometries .",
    "moreover , a forthcoming work @xcite will show its extendability and applicability to new fields namely , an extension of classical finsler metrics which allows one to model strong winds in zermelo navigation problem is introduced , and its geometrical properties are shown equivalent to the conformal ones of a class of spacetimes wider than standard stationary ones , which allow the possibility of horizons and black holes .",
