    "the similar empirical relation in @xcite also underestimates b(e2:@xmath0 ) at @xmath2 .",
    "the empirical rules suggest that the sharp increase of b(e2 ) is anomalous because ex(@xmath14 ) at @xmath2 is almost the same as those of the neighboring isotopes .",
    "we will next examine this anomaly in b(e2:@xmath0 ) within the framework of ibm @xcite .",
    "the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite has been widely used for describing the quadrupole collective states of the medium heavy nuclei .",

    "[ fig : ba ] , we used the latest experimental b(e2 ) data , some of which @xcite were measured after the publication of @xcite .",
    "we should mention again that , besides the experimental data , the ibm-2 results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ba ] are identical to fig .  4 of @xcite because we have taken the same parameters as was used in @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ba ] that the ibm-2 predictions with the pauli factor are in good agreement with the data for @xmath43 .",
    "however , for @xmath44 , ibm-2 without the pauli factor gives b(e2 ) values closer to the data than ibm-2 with the pauli factor .",
    "for @xmath45 , the b(e2 ) values of ibm-2 with the pauli factor saturate in the mid - shell in disagreement with the experimental trends . at @xmath2 , the ibm-2 calculations without the pauli factor yield nearly the same magnitude of b(e2:@xmath0 ) as the grodzins rule .",
    "thus , at @xmath2 , not only the grodzins rule but also ibm-2 underestimate the b(e2 ) values .",
    "the xe isotopes also showed a sharp increase in the b(e2 ) values at the mid - shell @xcite .",
    "raman et al .",
    "pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the single - shell model such as the single - shell nilsson model failed in reproducing the b(e2 ) values of the xe isotopes at @xmath46 64 - 66 , whereas several multi - shell models correctly predicted these values .",
    "they showed in @xcite that the rapid rise of the @xmath47 ( g9/2 ) oblate orbit for protons as a function of deformation and its intrusion into the 50 - 82 shell suggests a mechanism for increasing the b(e2:@xmath0 ) value as a result of partial emptying of this orbit due to pairing .",
    "however , the detailed manner by which the mid - shell xenon isotopes acquire significant deformation is still unclear , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we aim in this paper at clarifying the origin of the sharp increase of b(e2:@xmath0 ) observed in the mid - shell ba isotopes . to achieve this objective",
    ", we used the axially symmetric deformed woods - saxon ( ws ) hamiltonian plus the bcs method .",
    "all orbits with eigenenergies lower than the barrier height @xcite were adopted in the calculations .",
    "therefore , we can get rid of the drawbacks @xcite of the single - shell models such as the single - shell nilsson model .",
    "in contrast to the several theoretical tools examined in @xcite , we do not minimize a total hamiltonian to fix the intrinsic state of the ground band . instead , as a function of deformation parameter @xmath48 of the ws potential , we calculated intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath49 .",
    "then , we determined @xmath48 directly from the experimental @xmath49 values , by which we could discuss the variation of the intrinsic configuration of the ground band with the deformation .",
    "we will show that 15% of b(e2:@xmath0 ) for the ba isotope with @xmath2 is due to the level crossing between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbits , but the effect of the level crossing on b(e2 ) fades out rapidly as @xmath13 goes away from the mid - shell value of @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the sharp increase in b(e2 ) at the mid - shell is due to the level crossing between these orbits .",
    "we assume in this paper that individual nucleons move in the axially - symmetric quadrupole deformed woods - saxon potential and interact with each other by the monopole pairing force .",
    "we take the same form of the woods - saxon ( ws ) potential as was used in @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath52 deformation only , and denote the deformation parameter of the ws potential by @xmath48 as was already mentioned .",
    "we should mention here the @xmath53-softness or triaxiality of the heavier ba isotopes with @xmath54 .",
    "the ba isotopes exhibit the @xmath53-soft or o(6)-like level scheme for the heavier isotopes with @xmath54 @xcite , and change gradually from the @xmath53-soft to axially symmetric nuclei as @xmath13 approaches the mid - shell value of @xmath2 @xcite . through this paper",
    ", we assumed the axially symmetric ws potential for simplicity .",
    "this assumption may not be so valid for the heavier ba isotopes because of the @xmath53-softness .",
    "however , our major interest lies in the rapid increase in b(e2 ) of the ba isotopes with @xmath55 . for these nuclei ,",
    "the axial symmetry is a reasonable approximation .",
    "we use the wsbeta code @xcite for calculating the eigenenergies of the ws hamiltonian as well as the quadrupole moments of the eigenstates .",
    "we have several parameters in the ws potential @xcite such as the depth , radius and diffuseness of the central potential and those of the spin - orbit potential . among several parameter sets of the ws potential @xcite , we chose the `` universal '' parameter set @xcite .",
    "the other ws parameter sets such as the blomqvist - wahlborn , chepurnov , rost , and `` optimal '' parameter sets @xcite give almost the same results as the `` universal '' parameter set , although the details of these results are not shown in this paper .",
    "thus , the major results of this paper on the ba isotopes do not change among those ws parameter sets .",
    "we assume the pairing force for the residual interaction . as our concern is the proton quadrupole moment",
    ", we consider only proton system hereafter .",
    "the pair potential acting on the individual nucleons takes up the form of @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a proton in the eigenstate @xmath59 of the ws hamiltonian , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the corresponding time - reversed operator , and the constant @xmath62 represents the pairing gap whose value is fixed by @xmath63 in terms of coupling constant @xmath64 and pair moment @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 using the bogoliubov - valatin transformation @xcite , we can diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the ws hamiltonian , @xmath69 the number operator for the protons , and @xmath70 the chemical potential .",

    ".    we determined the @xmath64 value for @xmath80ba by the condition that the pairing gap for the protons should equal the empirical value given by @xcite : @xmath81 @xmath5 1.1 mev at @xmath48=0.3 , which @xmath48 value roughly corresponds to the deformation of ba with @xmath2 as will be shown below .",

    "the former jump is due to the level crossing between the single particle orbits originating from the spherical sub - shells of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
