    "this result confirms the one obtained by catalano & leone ( 1996 ) . in an attempt to clarify the nature of the correlation between light and helium lines variations , these authors compared the emerging fluxes of two atmosphere models with the same effective temperature ( t@xmath40=15000 k ) and gravity ( log g=4.0 ) but with different helium abundance .",
    "the models were computed by means of the atlas9 code ( kurucz 1993 ) and are characterized by solar and zero helium abundance . by comparing these fluxes , they found no observable magnitude differences and concluded that the photometric variations presented by helium weak stars can not be entirely ascribed to the non homogeneous distribution of helium on the stellar surface . + figure  [ summary ] shows the measured average value of the equivalent width of the hei5876 line together with the theoretical behaviour computed in the nlte approximation by leone & lanzafame ( 1998 ) for solar composition stars .",
    "we conclude the helium abundance is not peculiar for the stars hd36589 , hd43819 , hd171247 , hd177003 , hd182255 and hd209515 , while helium is underabundant in the remaining stars .",
    "it is worthy note , that the equivalent width of the hei5876 line for hd182255 is close to the value of a solar composition main sequence star , even though this star is classified as an helium weak star .",
