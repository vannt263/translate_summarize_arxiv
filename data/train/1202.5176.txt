    "in the last years , field theory models constructed in lower dimensions of space - time have been intensively discussed , because , through ads / cft correspondence @xcite , they could be related to more elaborated theories in higher dimensions .",
    "the supersymmetric gauge theories in lower dimensions considered as candidates to describe @xmath1-branes  @xcite attract main attention .",
    "currently , a large number of papers is devoted to the study of several aspects of these theories , such as effective potential calculations  @xcite , dualities  @xcite and generation of mass through the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the schwinger model , i.e. quantum electrodynamics in two dimensions of space - time , is of the special interest among the low - dimensional gauge theories since it possesses the interesting feature of dynamical generation of mass and is known as an example of a confining model in the commutative  @xcite and noncommutative space - time  @xcite .",
    "it is worth it to mention that the two - dimensional noncommutative supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum electrodynamics is finite to all loop orders in perturbation theory @xcite , with the same conclusion being true for the three - dimensional commutative susy qed @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we are using the superfield formalism ; it is the more convenient way to evaluate feynman diagrams in susy models .",
    "it preserves a manifest supersymmetry in all stages of calculations , avoiding potential problems , such as , for example , the lack of a supersymmetric renormalization presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is not a problem when supergraph techniques are used  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model and evaluate the quadratic part of the effective action for the gauge superfield , in order to observe the dynamical generation of mass to the noncommutative supersymmetric schwinger model .",
    "we demonstrate that this effect is independent of the noncommutative parameter @xmath0 , up to one - loop order , just as the nonsupersymmetric version of present model  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ final ] , we present our last comments and remarks .",
    "our starting point is the classical action of the noncommutative susy schwinger model , @xmath2_*\\right)\\big{\\}}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3_{*}-\\dfrac{e^2}{6}[\\gamma^{\\beta},\\ { \\gamma_{\\beta},\\gamma_{\\alpha}\\}_{*}]_{*}$ ] is the noncommutative gauge superfield strength which transforms covariantly , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being a real scalar superfield , and the exponential is treated in the sense of the moyal star - product . essentially , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is no difference between conventions and notations for supersymmetric models defined in three and two dimensions of space - time .",
    "we use the notations and conventions as adopted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a gauge fixing and the corresponding faddeev - popov ghosts terms is required to quantize this model .    for later purposes ,",
    "let us write the quadratic part of the gauge superfield action , which is given by @xmath6    the propagators obtained from eq.([eq1 ] ) , for the pure gauge sector , can be cast as @xmath7    where @xmath8 .    for simplicity , but without loss of generality",
    ", we will work in the feynman gauge , i.e. we choose @xmath9 .",
    "the effective action receives one - loop contributions from the diagrams drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . performing the d - algebra manipulations with the help of the mathematica@xmath10 packet susymath @xcite",
    ", we arrive at the following results .",
    "the supergraph [ fig : diagrams](a ) is vanishing , while other contributions can be cast as @xmath11 @xmath12    performing some algebraic manipulations and adding these two contributions , we have @xmath13    using feynman representation and trivial transformations , we can rewrite the integral over @xmath14 as @xmath15 ^ 2 } -\\frac{\\cos(2k\\wedge p)}{[k^2+p^2x(1-x)]^2}\\big]\\equiv \\frac{1}{2}(i_1-i_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are planar and nonplanar contributions .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath18    where @xmath19 .",
    "we note , however , that this integral diverges both at higher and lower limits , so , we implement the cutoff regularizations on both limits which yields @xmath20 where , at the end of the calculations , one must put @xmath21 .    applying the results from ref .",
    "@xcite and regularizing the integral in the similar way , we find @xmath22    where @xmath23 , which in two dimensions of space - time can be written as @xmath24 , once we assume @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the final expression for the integral : @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    unfortunately , this integral can not be more simplified since the modified bessel function can not be expressed in terms of the elementary functions . however , for our aims , that is , for studying the mass generation , we can use its asymptotic behavior for small and large arguments : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a constant whose explicit value is not important .",
    "therefore , in the limit of @xmath29 , we obtain that the integral @xmath30 is of order of @xmath31 . taking into account only two leading terms of the expansion of the modified bessel function , we find that the terms singular in the limits @xmath32 and @xmath33 turn out to be completely cancelled , after which we can remove the regularization , and the integral over the feynman parameter @xmath34 is trivial .",
    "we note that had we used other regularization , for example , the dimensional one , the situation could be just the same , that is , the final result would be free of any singularities . as a result",
    ", we find that the effective action is just given by @xmath35   \\gamma^{\\beta}(-p,\\theta).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we conclude that no mass is dynamically generated due to a self - interacting gauge sector in the small noncommutativity limit .",
    "it is clear that this result differs from that obtained in the large noncommutativity limit  @xcite where the noncommutative @xmath36 model was shown to be equivalent to the commutative @xmath37 theory in the large-@xmath38 limit .",
    "the reason is as follows : while the noncommutative qed in the limit @xmath39 behaves like a @xmath37 yang - mills theory in the large-@xmath38 limit , in the limit @xmath40 , the noncommutative qed behaves like a free theory .",
    "therefore the dynamics of this theory in these two limits radically differs .",
    "hence , the results for one limit should not be expected to be reproduced in another limit .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering the theory in the limit of @xmath41 , we obtain that the integral @xmath30 behaves like @xmath16 .",
    "to study dynamical generation of mass , it is enough to evaluate the effective action in the limit @xmath42  @xcite .",

    "one should notice that the dynamically generated mass is independent of noncommutative parameter @xmath0 .",

    "we add the following matter superfield action : @xmath46\\big{\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which we obtain the matter superfield propagator given by @xmath47    the contributions due to matter coupling , figs .",

    "when the matter superfields are in the noncommutative adjoint representation , the model does not exhibit such an effect in the small @xmath0 limit .    on the other hand , in the limit of large noncommutativity , i.e. @xmath39 , we observe that the model presents a dynamical generation of mass to the gauge superfield with or without matter couplings . in respect of the pure gauge sector ,",
