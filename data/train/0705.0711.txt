    "the theoretical study of the formation and evolution of regions in non uniform media is motivated by the observational result that the molecular clouds where massive star form generally possess density gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the assumed density law is taken to be a power law @xmath2 with exponents ranging from 1 to 3 @xcite obtained from molecular line studies .",
    "submillimeter continuum dust emission observations of the molecular material around embedded ultracompact regions gives an exponent in the range 1.25 to 2.25 .",
    "the most commonly found value for the power - law exponent is @xmath3 , which correponds to an isothermal , self - gravitating sphere .",
    "however , steeper density laws , @xmath4 have been inferred from radio continuum spectra of a sample of ultracompact regions @xcite .",

    "the edge of the cloud `` breaks out '' into the low density , intercloud medium during the expansion stage and the ionized gas can achieve supersonic velocities of around 30  km  s@xmath5 in the accelerating flow .",
    "this problem was studied in more detail by @xcite , and applied to the orion nebula region .",
    "they found that a long - lived quasi - stationary phase exists in which the ionized flow is approximately steady in the frame of reference of the ionization front . during this phase ,",
    "the flow structure is determined entirely by the distance of the ionizing star from the front and the curvature of the front .",
    "the curvature determines whether the flows are more `` champagne like '' or `` globule like '' .",
    "the curvature of the ionization front depends on the lateral density distribution in the neutral gas",
    ".    developed analytical solutions for the formation and expansion of regions in spherically symmetric , power - law density distributions , where the ionizing star is assumed to be at the center of the density distribution .",
    "the main result of their paper is that for spherical clouds with power - law density distributions @xmath6 , there is a critical value of the exponent , @xmath7 above which the cloud becomes completely ionized during the expansion phase of the region . for power - law exponents higher than this critical value",
    ", two regimes were identified : a slow regime , in which the expansion of the dense cloud core is mildly supersonic and has almost constant velocity , corresponding to @xmath8 , and the fast regime , where the core expansion drives a strongly accelerating shock , which corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "this problem was revisited by @xcite , who developed a self - similar solution for the internal motions in the ionized gas in the @xmath10 cases .",
    "also considered self - gravitating isothermal disk density distributions where the density fall - off is steeper than @xmath11 . in this case , the region becomes unbounded in a conical section of the disk , where the opening angle of the cone depends on the ratio of the strmgren radius in the midplane density to the density distribution scale height . during the expansion stage of such regions ,",
    "the flattening of the internal ionized gas density distribution can lead to the trapping of an initially unbounded ionization front .",
    "more recently , photoionized regions in a variety of axisymmetric density distributions were modeled numerically by @xcite , who also included the central star s stellar wind . in that work",
    ", it was found that the hot bubble created by the shocked stellar wind results in a champagne flow being set up outside the swept - up stellar wind shell , leading to mixed kinematics from an observational point of view .",
    "@xcite also considered the possibility of stellar motion up the density gradient , which introduces the added complication of bowshock kinematics to the problem .",
    "@xcite performed low - resolution three - dimensional numerical simulations of region dynamical evolution in a collapsing molecular cloud . here",
    ", the density distribution had a core - envelope structure , where the envelope had a power - law ( @xmath0 ) density distribution .",
    "both turbulent and non - turbulent cases were modeled . in the non - turbulent case ,",
    "even for ionizing sources off - center from the core , the region expansion was nearly spherical for the parameters adopted and the timescale of the simulation .",
    "the photoionized regions produced by moving stars were studied numerically by @xcite . in that paper , the regions produced by a star off - center in a spherically symmetric density distribution were modeled , where a range of stellar velocities ( between 0 and 12  km  s@xmath5 ) were considered . it was found that the region produced by a star off - center in an underlying @xmath0 density distribution did not become unbounded , while that in a @xmath1 density distribution did , for the case of a stationary star .",
    "this appears to contradict the main result of @xcite .",
    "this result is the motivation for the present work , where we aim to provide simple tools for analyzing the formation and expansion of regions off - center in spherically symmetric density distributions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in   [ sec : prob ] we outline the problem and discuss the initial formation stage of an region off - center in a spherically symmetric density distribution and find a criterion for the region to remain bounded . in   [ sec : expand ] we investigate the expansion stage and derive a simple differential equation that describes the expansion of the ionization front along the symmetry axis .",

    ", the ionization front will break out ( turn supersonic with respect to the ionized gas ) unless pressure balance between the internal photoionized gas and the external medium is achieved before this point . for strmgren radius to stellar offset radius ratios of more than 0.02 ,",
    "pressure balance is not possible for an isothermal 100  k medium in hydrostatic equilibrium and so the region will become unbounded , eventually , in these cases .",
    "we performed numerical simulations to test the assumption of constant density within the ionized gas during the expansion phase adopted in   [ sec : expand ] .",
    "we found that this assumption is valid in the `` downhill '' ( @xmath23 ) direction from the star , but is not so good in the opposite ( `` uphill '' , @xmath21 ) direction . in the @xmath23 direction ,",
    "the numerical solution and analytical solution follow the same expansion law once the elapsed time is greater than about half a sound crossing time .",
    "we also assessed the validity of the simple analytical approximation to the ionization front shape .",
    "although the volume of ionized gas is slightly underestimated in the analytical approximation , the effect is not significant , as evinced by the agreement between the numerical and analytic expansion laws .",
    "this gives us confidence that our simple description of the region expansion can provide insight into this complicated problem .",

    "<S> the expansion of ionization fronts in uniform and spherically symmetric power - law density distributions is a well - studied topic . </S>",
    "<S> however , in many situations , such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core , an offset power - law density distribution would be more appropriate . in this paper a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of hii regions in such media </S>",
    "<S> are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the underlying power laws are @xmath0 and @xmath1 . a simple criterion is developed for determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded , which depends on the power - law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent strmgren radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance . in the expansion stage , the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas . </S>"
