    "the buneman instability has been extensively studied in theory and simulation since it was discovered in 1958 @xcite .",
    "it is well - known in one - dimensional ( 1d ) theory that once the relative drift of ions and electrons exceeds the threshold of approximately twice the electron thermal velocity , the interactions between waves and electrons will lead to the growth of the buneman instability@xcite .",
    "lower hybrid instabilities lie on an oblique branch of current - driven instabilities@xcite with @xmath1 .",
    "their relation to buneman instabilities has not been clarified yet in two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectral space .",
    "recently , interest in buneman and lower hybrid instabilities has been renewed because of their importance in magnetic reconnection@xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most relevant mechanisms associated with explosive events in nature and in laboratory experiments , such as solar flares , substorms in the magnetosphere , and sawtooth crashes in fusion experiments .",
    "magnetic reconnection can convert magnetic field energy into thermal and kinetic energy .",
    "oppositely directed magnetic fields merge and lead to the release of a significant fraction of the stored magnetic energy , which produces two regions of fast outflow ( see fig .",
    "[ illu ] ) .",
    "one of the most important problem in understanding magnetic reconnection is determining what mechanisms can facilitate reconnection fast enough to explain the explosive events observed . from magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models , the convection and diffusion of the magnetic field can be described in terms of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the typical plasma velocity and magnetic field spatial length . if @xmath5 , the collisional resistivity can effectively dissipate the magnetic field s energy and facilitate fast reconnection . however , the following question remains : what drives fast reconnection if the collision - induced resistivity is not sufficiently large ( i.e. @xmath6 ) ? this is a condition common in both space and laboratory plasmas .",
    "one of the most promising and physically interesting mechanism proposed to answer this question is turbulence - induced dissipation facilitating fast reconnection@xcite .    for turbulence - induced dissipation to work , the turbulence has to be generated spontaneously during the magnetic reconnection .",
    "in the diffusion region of magnetic reconnection , current sheets form as a result of changes in the magnetic field configuration .",
    "the intense thin current sheets which develop in strong guide field reconnection can drive streaming instabilities @xcite and electron velocity shear instabilities@xcite etc .",
    "the latest 3d pic simulations show that anomalous momentum transport generated by an electromagnetic electron velocity shear instability can influence the magnetic reconnection process@xcite , but if turbulence resistivity can affect reconnection rates is still unclear",
    ". a deeper understanding of current - driven electrostatic instabilities is required .",
    "buneman and lower hybrid instabilities are two of the most common _",
    "electrostatic _ instabilities driven within current sheets in magnetic reconnection .",
    "they can produce electron holes and strong turbulent heating near the x - line and near the separatrix @xcite ( fig.[illu ] ) .",
    "current sheets become thinner and thinner during reconnection , and velocity shear is generated in the current sheets regardless of the initial velocity distribution .",
    "extensive studies on new instabilities driven by electron velocity shear within current sheets have been performed@xcite .",
    "however , only a few studies have been carried out regarding how velocity shear affects the classical buneman and lower hybrid instabilities@xcite although their role is important to the understanding of turbulence - induced dissipation processes in reconnection .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the role of weak velocity shear on buneman and lower hybrid instabilities in 2d .",
    "specifically , we study a plasma model consisting of strongly magnetized electrons and cold unmagnetized ions . a mathieu equation analysis , first proposed by goldman@xcite , is used and the results are compared with those of vlasov simulations@xcite.the results we obtain from the mathieu equation analysis are found to be consistent with the results from the vlasov simulations with weak initial velocity shear , validating the approximations we adopted in the analytical method .",
    "we compare the buneman instability driven by electrons with a uniform velocity drift ( i.e. , the classical buneman instability ) with the instability driven by drifting electrons with a weak cosine velocity shear .",
    "we find that the buneman instability is no longer a purely magnetic field - aligned instability as commonly assumed in uniform beam@xcite . the velocity shear enhances the interplay between oblique waves and electrons and produces a wide range of eigenmodes with a common growth rate lower than in the uniform - drift case . as shear increases , the fastest growing mode changes from a parallel plane wave to an eigenmode with significant oblique wavenumber content , as discussed in appendix [ map ] .",
    "the shear does not significantly change the growth rate of the co - existing lower hybrid instability , which is much weaker than that of the buneman instability under our assumptions .",
    "we obtain the eigenfunctions in 2d spectral space from the mathieu equation analysis .",
    "these eigenfunctions show that the shear greatly modifies the 2d spatial structures of the instability - induced electric fields .    .",

    "2 ) the kinetic electrons are constrained to move along magnetic field lines while the ions are treated as unmagnetized and cold ( i.e. , the ratio of ion and electron temperature satisfies @xmath16 ) .",

    "the kappa distribution also simplifies the functional form of the susceptibilities , and thus enables us to obtain a specific mathematical differential equation with general solutions .",

    "compared to the electric fields at @xmath188 in the linear stage of the vlasov simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ e2d ] ( c , d ) , the superposition of theoretical electric fields reproduces the main features of the simulation electric fields , but not necessarily all of the subtle details , which are controlled by the exact amplitudes and phases of the different contributing eigenmodes .",
    "we show the power spectra of the theoretical electric fields in [ micspec ] in appendix .",
    "these features of the electric fields persist into the nonlinear stage , even after electron holes form ( e.g. , at @xmath189 , when the simulation has evolved into the nonlinear stage ) .",
    "even though the electric fields shown in fig .",

    "in this paper we explored the impact of velocity shear on the buneman and lower hybrid instabilities .",
    "we have studied the unstable modes for electron drifts modulated by a weak cosine velocity shear . in this case",
    "the dispersion relation can be approximated by the well - known mathieu equation , where we used a kappa - function for the initial distribution of infinitely magnetized electrons ( with cold unmagnetized ions ) , and we use a taylor expansion for the velocity shear .",
    "these approximations have been validated by comparing the analytical results with the results of vlasov simulations .",
    "the effect of velocity shear is expected to strengthen the interactions between oblique waves and particles because shear causes the fastest - growing buneman mode to change from a parallel plane wave to an eigenmode containing oblique as well as parallel fourier modes .",
    "the shear also distributes the unstable buneman eigenmodes over a wider range of eigenvalues , with nearly the same slightly lower growth rate than in the shear - free case .",
    "we conclude that the growth rate , wavelength , and orientation of the fastest growing buneman mode are controlled by the presence ( and amplitude ) of shear in the electron velocity drift .",
    "therefore , velocity shear can lead to different growth rates and wavelengths of unstable modes in the direction of the velocity gradient .",
    "the vlasov simulation show that the electron holes form at both the center and the edge of the simulation box . at the center ,",
    "electron trapping exhibits a longer wavelength consistent with the fact that the beam is at its fastest ; at the edge , electron trapping exhibits a shorter wavelength , consistent with the correspondingly slower beam .",
    "the velocity shear does not affect the growth rate of the weak lower hybrid instability , in which the interactions between lower hybrid waves and ions can transfer electron parallel momentum to the perpendicular motion of the ions .",
    "this momentum transfer can occur without necessarily affecting the temperature of the ions .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it provides eigenfunctions for every unstable mode so that we can investigate both the spectra and 2d spatial structure of the electric fields .",
    "these results can help us to interpret the physical content of simulations , experiments and satellite data .",
    "our method has assumed that the shear is weak .",
    "however , stronger velocity shear may reveal new physical regimes , including _ shear - driven _ as well as _ shear - modified _ instabilities . to address this issue",
    ", we are undertaking a study of how far the mathieu - equation analysis can be extended .",
    "this work was supported by nasa mms - ids grant nnx08ao84 g .",
    "we build a map between @xmath61 and @xmath70 by projecting the _ complex _ eigenmodes of @xmath190 and @xmath191 at t=0 into the @xmath17@xmath18 plane ,      we then perform a 2d fourier transformation of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in @xmath193 space",
    ". the results of fourier transformation should be the same for even and odd eigenfunctions . in this appendix",
    ", we use even eigenfunctions @xmath63 to analyze the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath154 .",
    "the results show that for @xmath102 the corresponding power spectrum is no longer concentrated on one specific @xmath154 but is instead spread over a range of @xmath154 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rkymap1 ] .",
    "we take the @xmath154 corresponding to the maximum power intensity . on the other hand",
    "the correspondence between @xmath61 and @xmath154 is different for @xmath86 and @xmath143 .",
    "fig  [ rkymap ] shows this map between @xmath154 and @xmath61 .",
    "black circle is for @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath143 eigenmodes @xmath195 have @xmath196 while @xmath130 corresponds to @xmath197 , @xmath198 correspond to @xmath199 respectively .",
    "@xmath163 eigenmode corresponds to @xmath200 and others in between @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the @xmath86 eigenmodes for @xmath203 have a relatively linear correlation with @xmath154 , but for @xmath204 , @xmath154 decreases from @xmath205 to @xmath206 .      to provide a fuller picture of the spectra from theory ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ micspec ] the power spectra of the superposition of theoretical eigenmode electric fields @xmath86 and @xmath143 previously shown in fig .",
    "[ e2d ] .",
    "we reiterate that the 2d theoretical @xmath86 and @xmath143 only reproduce the main features of the electric fields and thus the their power spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ micspec ] can only approximate the realistic power spectra from the simulation as shown in fig .",
    "[ simspec ] .",
    "however , figs .",
    "[ simspec ] and [ micspec ] do both show the same two distinct ranges of @xmath76 .",
    "again , the differences are controlled by the exact amplitudes and phases of the contributing eigenmodes , which we can not determine theoretically .",
