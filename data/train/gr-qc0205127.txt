    "no disk solution exists and a genuine kerr black hole forms .",
    "this transition ( parametric collapse ) from the disk to the kerr black hole is _ continuous _ in the ` exterior region ' . in particular , all multipole moments behave continuously , see @xcite .",
    "the exterior metric of a spherically symmetric star , even in the case of ( dynamic ) collapse , is always the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this is a consequence of birkhoff s theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spherically symmetric collapse of a sufficiently massive , non  rotating star at the end of its life leads quite naturally to a schwarzschild black hole , as in the idealized oppenheimer  snyder case . on the other hand , a continuous quasi ",
    "static transition from stars to black holes is not possible .",
    "the surface of a star can not be identical with the horizon of a black hole since the horizon is a null  hypersurface . under the quite reasonable assumption that the mass  energy density does not increase outwards in the star",

    "thus , at most the @xmath173 part of the schwarzschild vacuum metric is relevant outside static stars and the black hole state can only be reached dynamically .    for rotating stars",
    ", the situation is different in both previously mentioned respects .",
    "firstly , the exterior metric is not the kerr metric in general .",
    "( there is no analogue to birkhoff s theorem . )",
    "it is general belief , based on penrose s cosmic censureship conjecture combined with the black hole uniqueness theorems , cf .",
    "@xcite , that the ( dynamic ) collapse of a rotating star leads asymptotically ( @xmath174 ) to the kerr black hole , i.e. , to the kerr metric outside the horizon .",
    "this has not yet been proved , however .",
    "but secondly , a continuous quasi  stationary route from rotating stars to rotating black holes via the extreme kerr metric seems possible  as in the idealized ( and certainly unstable ) case of the rigidly rotating disk of dust .",
    "the problem of the impossible identity of the star s surface with the horizon would be circumvented by the ` throat region ' , and the whole @xmath169 part of the extreme kerr metric could be relevant in the ` exterior region ' , as discussed above .",
    "results on differentially rotating disks of dust @xcite give some evidence that the extreme kerr limit is a generic possibility .",
    "general relativistic , rotating stellar models can only be treated by numerical methods so far . however , the recently achieved progress in accuracy by many orders of magnitude @xcite justifies the hope of finding a more realistic , quasi  stationary route to the kerr metric .",
