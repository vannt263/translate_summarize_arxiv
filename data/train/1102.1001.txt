    "@xcite at the same time , our recent calculations of the ground state for both stress - free and substrate - supported superlattices with @xmath11 and 3 ( ref .  ) revealed that the ground - state structure of knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattices is monoclinic or orthorhombic , and is not tetragonal .",
    "along with the ferroelectric instability , three unstable phonon modes that are not typical neither for knbo@xmath0 nor for ktao@xmath0 were observed at @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 points of the brillouin zone in the paraelectric phase of these sls .",

    "the polarization profiles obtained in this work agree with results of atomistic modeling of knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattices .",
    "@xcite according to the data of these papers , the polarization parallel to the layers decreased by 34 times when shifting by one unit cell from the heterojunction ( in contrast to the behavior of the polarization normal to the layers ) .",
    "our conclusion about the instability of @xmath27 phonon in the paraelectric phase of sls with @xmath40 agrees with results of ref .   only partially : in the latter paper stable polar phase with @xmath32 symmetry was obtained only in sls with @xmath11 and 2 .",
    "the instability of the @xmath25 mode in sl with @xmath41 agrees with that observed in ref .  , but in this work it is much stronger .",
    "however , in spite of qualitative agreement of results of this and previous works , the physical conclusions that we make are very different .",
    "first , in all stress - free knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattices the @xmath32 phase is not the ground - state structure , as well as in ktao@xmath0-supported superlattices with @xmath42 .",
    "the reason for this is a tendency of polarization in sls to incline towards the layer plane .",
    "this tendency was revealed in a number of ferroelectric superlattices  @xcite and was shown to be a way to reduce the electrostatic and mechanical energies in them .",
    "second , the existence of stable polarization in knbo@xmath0 layers with a thickness of one unit cell and very inhomogeneous distribution of polarization , which is accompanied by exponential decay of the interaction energy between neighboring layers with increasing the interlayer distance , result in a new , previously unknown feature of the ground - state structure of ( knbo@xmath0)@xmath1(ktao@xmath0)@xmath2 superlattice  the formation of an array of nearly independent ferroelectrically ordered planes in the bulk of the superlattice .",

    "@xcite the dispersion curves for these modes are shown in fig .",
    "analysis of the eigenvectors shows that the doubly degenerate unstable mode along @xmath14@xmath12 direction is polarized along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions while nondegenerate unstable modes along @xmath12@xmath13 , @xmath13@xmath10 , and @xmath10@xmath14 directions are polarized along [ 010 ] direction .",
    "the character of atomic displacements for these modes is fully consistent with the ferroelectric instability of ... o  nb  o ... chains first observed in knbo@xmath0 ,  @xcite but in sls the chains are formed only in [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions .",
    "a  nearly zero dispersion of the unstable mode along @xmath14@xmath12 direction means that the interlayer interaction is weak , and the instability against the formation of ferroelectrically ordered planes does not depend on whether neighboring planes are ordered ferroelectrically or antiferroelectrically .",
    "this supports the idea about independence of ferroelectrically ordered planes in sls with thick ktao@xmath0 layers .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate that in complex systems in some cases the polarization calculated using the berry phase method can not be interpreted as a bulk property .",
    "the variations in polarization in the unit cell can be so large that the ferroelectric system can acquire the properties of two - dimensional system . to avoid interaction between polarized layers",
    ", the polarization should be parallel to the layers ( a non - zero normal component results in appearance of electric fields in the structure , and 2d behavior transforms to 3d one ) .",
    "this means that to create arrays of nearly independent ferroelectrically ordered planes in [ 001]-oriented superlattices , we need sls with @xmath34 or @xmath33 ground - state structure .    complex ferroelectric / antiferroelectric behavior has been observed recently in ruddlesden  popper ( rp ) superlattices ,  @xcite in which appearance of goldstone - like rotational mode of the in - plane polarization is possible .",
    "@xcite in stress - free batio@xmath0/sro superlattices , the in - plane polarization appeared in sls with the batio@xmath0 slab thickness of @xmath45 unit cells ; when these sls were epitaxially grown on srtio@xmath0 substrates , the polar structure transformed to antiferroelectric ( domain - like ) structure in which out - of - plane polarization alternated along [ 100 ] or [ 110 ] directions in each of batio@xmath0 slabs .",
    "the antiferroelectric structure was studied in more detail in batio@xmath0/bao superlattices grown on srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "@xcite the instability at @xmath10 point of the brillouin zone appeared in structures at a thickness of batio@xmath0 slabs of 23 unit cells while the zone - center ferroelectric instability appeared only at @xmath345 unit cells .",
    "it was supposed that a huge depolarizing field appears in sls because of the difficulty to polarize bao layer , and this strongly harden the @xmath27 ferroelectric mode at the @xmath14 point . at the same time ,",
    "the @xmath10 phonon mode arising from the same ferroelectric instability of",
    "... o  ti  o ... chains does not produce macroscopic depolarizing field , and so the influence of the bao layer on the phonon frequency is weaker .",
    "this explains why in rp superlattices the antiferroelectric phase can appear before the ferroelectric one .",
    "the superlattices studied in this work differ markedly from rp ones  @xcite because in our case the ferroelectric layers are separated by the layers of incipient ferroelectric , which has much higher dielectric constant compared to sro ( bao ) . in contrast to the rp superlattices , our sls do not exhibit antiferrodistortive instability .",
    "in addition , the thickness of the knbo@xmath0 layer which is necessary to induce ferroelectricity in our sls is only one unit cell . to test the influence of the thickness of knbo@xmath0 layer on the appearance of aforementioned antiferroelectric structure , we performed additional calculations for stress - free sls in which knbo@xmath0 layers with a thickness of 3 and 5  unit cells were separated with a thick ( 3  unit cells ) ktao@xmath0 layer .",
    "the calculations showed that all three ( knbo@xmath0)@xmath2(ktao@xmath0)@xmath0 sls with @xmath11 , 3 , and 5 studied in this work are unstable against the appearance of antiferroelectric structure with out - of - plane displacements of ions described by @xmath10 phonon ( @xmath46 space group ) , but in all cases the energies of corresponding equilibrium structures are higher than the energies of the ferroelectric @xmath33 phases .",
    "this means that antiferroelectric @xmath46 structure is not the ground state of stress - free knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattice .",
    "moreover , the calculation of phonon frequencies at the @xmath14 point for @xmath46 phase of ( knbo@xmath0)@xmath1(ktao@xmath0)@xmath1 sl showed that this antiferroelectric phase exhibits the _ ferroelectric _ instability against the appearance of in - plane polarization .",
    "therefore one can conclude that like for rp superlattices , the antiferroelectric phase of knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattices with out - of - plane displacements of ions is indeed more stable compared to the ferroelectric phase with out - of - plane polarization , but nevertheless the ferroelectric @xmath33 phase with non - zero in - plane polarization has the lowest energy . in rp superlattices studied so far , the in - plane polarization was suppressed by epitaxial strain from the substrate , and the antiferroelectric phase was the most stable one .",
    "we discuss now possible applications of the arrays of nearly independent ferroelectrically ordered planes . at first sight , the fact that the polarization in knbo@xmath0/ktao@xmath0 superlattices is oriented in the layer plane can be regarded as not intriguing .",
    "so far , when discussing the ferroelectricity in ultrathin films , main attention was paid to films in which the polarization is normal to the film surface as these films are more suitable for different applications .",
    "however , the possibility of formation of an array of nearly independent ferroelectrically ordered planes opens new opportunities in design of electronic devices .",
    "these structures can be used as a medium for three - dimensional information recording . accepting that the lateral size of a ferroelectric domain that has a long - time stability against spontaneous reversal of polarization is 250   ,  @xcite for the interlayer distance of 16   ( the period of sl with @xmath47 ) the estimated 3d information storage density can be as high as @xmath48@xmath49  bit/@xmath50 .",
    "this value exceeds the density achieved in modern optical 3d recording media by six orders of magnitude .",
    "one can add that the two - component order parameter , which admits the rotation of polarization by 90@xmath51 in each of independent knbo@xmath0 layers , offers one more opportunity .",
    "in ferroelectric ram devices with polarization normal to the film surface the leakage currents and conductivity of films are main effects preventing the realization of non - destructive read - out .",
    "the systems admitting the rotation of polarization by 90@xmath51 have a feature that enables to overcome this disadvantage  a non - destructive read - out of polarization in them can be realized using the anisotropy of the dielectric constant in the layer plane .",
    "our calculations predict that in ( knbo@xmath0)@xmath1(ktao@xmath0)@xmath2 superlattice with @xmath38 the dielectric constants parallel and perpendicular to the polarization are 142 and 188 , whereas in the sl with @xmath47 they are 225 and 281 .",
    "in this work , the density - functional theory was used to calculate the properties of ( knbo@xmath0)@xmath1(ktao@xmath0)@xmath2 superlattices with @xmath317 .",
    "it was shown that the ferroelectric ordering is retained in knbo@xmath0 layers of minimal thickness ( one unit cell ) whereas the interaction energy between neighboring polarized layers decreases exponentially with increasing parameter @xmath5 .",
    "array of nearly independent ferroelectrically ordered planes with the polarization lying in the layer plane was shown to be the ground - state structure for sls with @xmath4 .",
