    "amphiphilic block copolymers , which consists of hydrophilic subchains and hydrophobic subchains , are known to form micellar structures , such as spherical micelles , cylindrical micelles , and vesicles @xcite . to clarify how these structures are self - organised is a basic problem of the kinetics of micellar systems .",
    "several computer simulations have been available to study formation of a vesicle based on the particle models ( brownian dynamics ( bd ) @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite , and molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite ) .",
    "the spontaneous vesicle formation process from the homogeneous state observed in these simulations is as follows : the amphiphilic block copolymers aggregate into small spherical micelles rapidly from the homogeneous initial state .",
    "the spherical micelles grows to larger micelles by collision ( cylindrical micelles , open disk - like micelles ) .",
    "the large disk - like micelles finally close up and form vesicles . the micelle growth process and the closure process are slower than the first spherical micelle formation process .",
    "hereafter we call this process the `` mechanism i '' ( see also figure [ vesicle_formation_mechanisms](a ) ) . note that the mechanism i is also supported by monte carlo simulations @xcite or experiments of lipid systems @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", the mechanism obtained by the experiments for lipid systems may be different from one for polymer systems .",
    "however , since the dpd simulations for polymer systems and the bd and md simulations for lipid systems give similar results ( mechanism i ) , we believe that the vesicle formation mechanism is common for polymer systems and lipid systems",
    ". we also note that the similar mechanism obtained for polymer systems by the experiments of morphological transition of cylindrical micelles to vesicles @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical approach , which has been developed to study mesoscale structures of block copolymers @xcite , is considered to be useful for vesicle formation , but most of the works have been limited to simulations in thermal equilibrium @xcite . since these simulations ignore realistic kinetics ( for example , local mass conservation is not satisfied ) , the vesicle formation process observed in these simulations are different from the mechanism i : the first process is similar to the mechanism i. small spherical micelles are formed rapidly .",
    "the spherical micelles then grow up to large spherical micelles by the evaporation - condensation like process .",
    "the large spherical micelles are energetically unfavourable , and thus the large micelles take the solvents into them to lower the energy .",
    "we call this process the `` mechanism ii '' ( see also figure [ vesicle_formation_mechanisms](b ) ) .",
    "the dynamical simulations for diblock copolymer solutions were carried by sevink and zvelindovsky @xcite , using the dynamic self consistent field ( scf ) theory . however , in their simulations both subchains are hydrophobic and the resulting structures are so - called onion structures @xcite .",
    "the onion structures obtained by simulations are essentially microphase separation structure in the block copolymer rich droplets in the solvents , and qualitatively different from the multilayer vesicle structures which is often called as `` onion structures '' in surfactant solutions .",
    "the vesicle structures contain solvents inside them and therefore different from these polymer onion structures , and one should distinguish the onion formation process from the vesicle formation process .",
    "we also note that the simulations for onion structures were carried out for weak segregation region and this does not agree with previous equilibrium simulations for vesicles , since vesicles are observed in rather strong segregation region .",
    "( in this work , we use the word `` strong segregation region '' as the region where the minimum and maximum values of the density field is approximately @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one may call such region as the intermediate segregation region . )",
    "it should be noted that the formation processes of the onion structures by simulations @xcite are mainly the lamellar ordering process in droplet like regions .",
    "therefore the resulting morphologies ( onions ) are similar to the phase separation patterns in droplets @xcite than vesicles .",
    "thus we consider that the onion formation process is not the mechanism i.    recently , dynamical simulations of vesicle formation have been done by he and schmid @xcite , using the external potential dynamics ( epd ) @xcite .",
    "they obtained vesicles , but their formation process is similar to the mechanism ii .",
    "unfortunately the mechanism ii is qualitatively different from the mechanism i , and this means that their result does not agree with particle simulations or experiments ( we will discuss the reason for this difference in section [ comparison_with_epd_simulations ] ) .",
    "we expect that the mechanisms observed by different simulation methods should be the same .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply our previous model , the density functional theory for block copolymers @xcite , to the dynamics .",
    "we carry out numerical simulations for amphiphilic diblock copolymer solutions in three dimensions . by using the continuous field model ,",
    "we show , for the first time , that a vesicle is spontaneously formed from a disordered uniform phase .",
    "the simulation result is consistent with the mechanism i. we also show that we can simulate the spontaneous formation process of various micellar structures ( such as spherical micelles or cylindrical micelles ) and the morphological transition dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of block copolymer systems are well studied by using the dynamic scf theory @xcite as well as the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation @xcite .",
    "the dynamic scf simulations are known to be accurate for from weak segregation region to strong segregation region , but they consume memory and need large cpu power .",
    "in contrast , the tdgl simulations need less cpu power and enables large scale simulations .",
    "however , the free energy functionals @xcite used in the tgdl approach is generally not appropriate for the strong segregation region , since the validity of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) expansion is guaranteed only for the weak segregation region where the density fluctuation is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "actually maurits and fraaije @xcite showed that the widely used fourth - order gl expansion model is not sufficient for dynamical simulations . to overcome this limitation we need to use free energy functional model such as the flory - huggins - de gennes - lifshitz free energy @xcite , which is not expressed in the gl expansion form .    in previous simulations ,",
    "vesicles are observed for rather strong segregation region in diblock copolymer solutions .",
    "thus we can conclude that the use of inappropriate free energy functional models qualitatively affects micellar structures in diblock copolymer solutions .",
    "we need to use a free energy model and a dynamic equation which is valid for the strong segregation region and for the macrophase separation . in our previous work @xcite we proposed the free energy functional which is valid for strong segregation region , that is , valid for vesicles @xcite .",
    "the free energy functional for the system can be expressed as follows by using the soft - colloid picture @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the entropy functional and the interaction energy functional , and @xmath5 is the temperature .",
    "the entropy functional can be decomposed into two parts ; the translational entropy functional @xmath6 and the conformational entropy functional @xmath7 . in the density functional theory , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are expressed as the functional of the local volume fraction fields .",
    "( the local volume fraction field is equivalent to the local density field , if the segment volume is set to unity .",
    "we assume that the segment volume is unity in this work . )",
    "each contributions to the free energy functional can be modelled for ab type diblock copolymer and solvent mixtures by @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the local volume fraction of the @xmath13 segment at position @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the order parameter field ( @xmath16-field ) defined as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants determined from the block copolymer architecture ( we do nt show the explicit forms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 here ; they can be found in refs @xcite ) , @xmath20 is the block ratio of the block copolymer , @xmath21 is the kuhn length , @xmath22 is the flory - huggins @xmath23 parameter , and @xmath24 is the green function which satisfies @xmath25 \\tilde{\\mathcal{g}}(\\bm{r } - \\bm{r } ' ) = \\delta(\\bm{r } - \\bm{r}')$ ] @xcite , where @xmath26 is a cutoff length and is about the size of microphase separation structures .",
    "@xmath27 is the lagrange multiplier for the incompressible condition ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "the conformational entropy is expressed in the bilinear form of @xmath16-field @xcite .",
    "one significant property of the conformational entropy is that it satisfies the following relation . @xmath29    = \\alpha s_{\\text{conf}}\\left [ \\ { \\phi_{i}(\\bm{r } ) \\ }",
    "\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is arbitrary positive constant .",
    "( it is clear that the conformational entropy in the bilinear form of @xmath16 satisfies eq . )",
    "we can interpret eq as the extensivity of the conformational entropy ; under the current approximation ( using mean field , and neglecting many body correlations ) , the total conformational entropy is sum of the conformational entropy of each polymer chains .",
    "since the density profiles of miecellar structures are determined to achieve the low free energy , the conformational entropy which does not satisfy eq may lead unphysical density profile .",
    "we note that the lifshitz entropy @xcite and the conformational entropy calculated by the scf theory satisfy eq , while most of previous phenomenological free energy models do not satisfy eq .    substituting eqs - into eq",
    ", we get @xmath31   \\end{split}\\ ] ] the difference between the free energy functional and our previous model @xcite is the form of the green function ( in the previous theory , the green function @xmath32 has no cutoff , @xmath33 ) . a cutoff for the green function",
    "was first introduced by tang and freed @xcite , without derivation , for the ohta - kawasaki type standard gl free energy @xcite .",
    "the ohta - kawasaki type coulomb type long range interaction term may cause unphysical interaction or correlation in non - periodic systems such as block copolymer solutions .",
    "the true form of long range interaction can be , in principle , obtained by calculating higher order terms in free energy functional ( the effect of higher order vertex functions ) exactly . while we can calculate the higher order terms numerically by using the scf , it is practically impossible to get analytical form of them and take a summation .    to avoid the unphysical correlation without numerically demanding calculations , in the present study",
    ", we employ a theory which describes more precisely the properties of the length scale of the order of one polymer chain @xcite ; we modify the coulomb type interaction by introducing tang - freed type cutoff @xcite , instead of calculating higher order terms exactly .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that the interaction range ( or the cutoff length @xmath26 ) of the long range interaction can not exceed the characteristic size of the polymer chain .",
    "generally it is difficult to determine the cutoff length ( one way to determine it is to use the scf calculation or other microscopic calculations such as the md ) .",
    "here we estimate the cutoff length for the simplest case , diblock copolymer melts .",
    "for homogeneous ideal state , the cutoff length is considered to be the mean square end to end distance of a polymer chain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the polymerization index . on the other hand , for microphase separation structures at the strong segregation region ,",
    "the polymer chains are strongly stretched .",
    "the periods of the structures are known to be proportional to @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus we have the following polymerization index dependence for the cutoff length of diblock copolymer melts .",
    "we assume that the micellar structures have the similar cutoff length as the melt case . in this work we use @xmath38 for micellar systems .",
    "note that this is a rough estimation and the validity is not guaranteed . for example , the proportional coefficient in eq is ignored here , or the effect of swelling of the hydrophilic subchain in the solution is not taken into account .",
    "therefore the validity of this value of @xmath26 should be tested by comparing with the characteristic scale of the resulting phase separation structure .",
    "we also note that the dependence of the morphologies to the value of @xmath26 is not so sensitive ( see also appendix [ cutoff_length_dependency ] ) .",
    "what important here is that the interaction range is not infinite ( as the original ohta - kawasaki green function ) but finite ( as the modified green function by tang and freed ) .",
    "we employ the stochastic dynamic density functional model @xcite for the time evolution equation .",
    "the diblock copolymer solutions are expressed as three component systems ( hydrophilic subchain @xmath39 , hydrophobic subchain @xmath40 , and solvent @xmath3 ) . the dynamic equation for multicomponent systems",
    "can be expressed as follows .",

    "one can interpret that the temperature of the noise is the effective temperature @xmath49 , instead of the real temperature @xmath5 .",
    "we also note that @xmath50 can be generated easily by the algorithm proposed by van vlimmeren and fraaije @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that the free energy functional in eq is generally some kind of effective free energy functional , and is not equal to the free energy functional for the equilibrium state @xcite . in this work",
    "we approximate the effective free energy functional as the equilibrium free energy functional .",
    "this approximation corresponds to assume that all the polymer chains are fully relaxed , and thus this approximation neglects the viscoelasticity associated with the relaxation of polymer chains .",
    "we can interpret the dynamic equation as the tdgl equation . in this case , the onsager coefficients ( or the mobility ) @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this is most important for the strong segregation region or in the situation that the solute concentration is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "here we note that the tdgl equation with density dependent mobility and the free energy of ideal gases ( the translational entropy of ideal gases ) reduces to the diffusion equation ( or the smoluchowski equation ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that we should use the flory - huggins ( or bragg - williams ) type free energy model once we employed the density dependent mobility .",
    "similarly we should use the density dependent mobility if we employ the flory - huggins type free energy model .",

    "if we assume that the mixed solvent is the mixture of common solvent ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 is sufficiently small or negative ) and water , the volume fraction of water mainly affect the interaction between the hydrophobic subchain and the solvent .",
    "we change @xmath127 to mimic these experiments .",
    "figure [ structure_chi_parameter_dependence ] shows the results of simulations for various @xmath127 ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "we can observe the spherical micelles are formed for low @xmath127 and cylindrical micelles are formed for high @xmath127 .",
    "this agree with the experimental results qualitatively .",
    "shen and eisenberg @xcite reported that by controlling solvent condition , one can control the morphology of the block copolymer micelles .",
    "the control of the morphology is especially important for application use such as the drug delivery system .",
    "here we mimic the solvent condition change by changing the @xmath23 parameter between the hydrophobic segment and the solvent , @xmath127 .",
    "we change the @xmath23 parameter at @xmath113 ( figure [ vesicle_formation_snapshots](f ) ) , from @xmath130 to @xmath131 or @xmath132 , and perform the simulations up to @xmath133 .",
    "the snapshots at @xmath133 are shown in figure [ structural_transition ] .",
    "the vesicle is changed into spherical micelles ( figure [ structural_transition](a ) ) or cylindrical micelles ( figure [ structural_transition](b ) ) .",
    "the resulting morphologies are consistent with the morphologies obtained by the simulations started from the homogeneous state ( figure [ structure_chi_parameter_dependence](b ) and figure [ structure_chi_parameter_dependence](c ) ) .",
    "from the dynamics simulations based on the density functional theory for amphiphilic diblock copolymers , we could observe the time - evolution of spontaneous formation of vesicles .",
    "we also observed the micellar structures depending on the volume fraction of polymers .",
    "the observed vesicle formation process is just the same as the results of the previous particle model simulations ( mechanism i ) . at the initial stage of time evolution , rapid formation of small spherical micelles",
    "is observed .",
    "after the small micelles are formed , they aggregate each other by collision and become larger micelles . finally the large disk - like micelles are closed and become vesicles .",
    "the late stage process , collision process and the close - up process , is slower than the initial stage , as the mechanism i.    there are several important differences between our model and the standard tdgl model for the weak segregation limit . here",
    "we mention some essential properties of our model .",
    "first , our model can be applied for the strong segregation region , at least qualitatively .",
    "this is especially important , since the vesicles are observed in the strong segregation region .",
    "second , the interaction between the hydrophilic subchain and solvent should be handled carefully . if the hydrophilic interaction ( @xmath126 ) is too small or both subchains are hydrophobic , the system undergoes macrophase separation and separates into block copolymer rich region and solvent rich region .",
    "in such a situation , vesicles are not formed and onion structures @xcite are formed instead .",
    "third , we applied rather large thermal noise to the system .",
    "recently zhang and wang @xcite have shown that the glass transition temperature and the spinodal line ( stability limit of the disordered phase ) for the microphase separation in diblock copolymer melts are quite close .",
    "this implies that microphase separated structures in the block copolymer systems are intrinsically glassy at the strong segregation region . without sufficiently large and realistic thermal noise ,",
    "the system is completely trapped at intermediate metastable structures ( in most cases , spherical micelles ) and thus thermodynamically stable structures ( vesicles ) will never be achieved . as mentioned above , the magnitude of the noise is determined by the characteristic time scale and the factor @xmath64 is independent of the temperature .",
    "thus the noise is important for mesoscopic systems even if the temperature of the system is not high .",
    "here we discuss about the thermal noise in detail . intuitively , the large thermal noise is needed to overcome the free energy barrier . in the kinetic pathway of usual macrophase separation processes ( for example ,",
    "phase separations in homopolymer blends ) , there are not so large free energy barriers .",
    "therefore , in most cases , the simulations for such systems work well with small thermal noise or without thermal noise . on the other hand , in the kinetic pathway of vesicle",
    "/ micelle formation processes , there are various large free energy barriers ( for example , in the collision and coalescence process of spherical micelles ) .",
    "however , it is not clear and established how to determine the magnitude of the thermal noise for such systems .",
    "as mentioned , the thermal noise in eq is expressed by using the effective temperature @xmath49 , instead of the real temperature @xmath5 and @xmath64 is determined from the degree of coarse graining .",
    "intuitively this means that the coarse graining procedure decreases the degree of the freedom of the field .",
    "the similar approach can be found in the van vlimmeren and fraaije s theory @xcite .",
    "they employed the noise scaling parameter @xmath134 to express the effective degree of freedom in the simulation cell .",
    "these two approaches are similar and in fact , we can write the relation between them . @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the lattice vector . from eq",
    "we can calculate the noise scaling parameter for our simulation . using the parameters used in section [ results ]",
    ", we have @xmath137 .",
    "it should be noticed that this value of the noise scaling parameter is much smaller than the values used in most of previous works ( @xmath138 ) by fraaije et al @xcite .",
    "however , since the thermal noise play an important role in the vesicle formation process , we can not underestimate @xmath64 .",
    "one may consider that the mean field approximation and the free energy functional does not hold for low noise scaling parameter systems .",
    "it may be true , but as shown by dean@xcite , the dynamic density functional equation holds even if there are not large number of particles .",
    "thus here we believe that the mean field approximation still holds for our systems .",
    "to show the necessity of the large thermal noise in the simulations , we perform several simulations with various values of @xmath64 .",
    "we expect that the simulations for small boxes are sufficient to see the effect of the magnitude of the thermal noise , since the effect is large even for early stage of the dynamics .",
    "thus we perform simulations for small systems ( system size @xmath139 , lattice points @xmath140 ) with different values of @xmath64 , @xmath141 .",
    "all the other parameters are set to the previous vesicle formation simulations in section [ results ] ( figure [ vesicle_formation_snapshots ] ) .",
    "figure [ thermal_noise_snapshots ] shows the snapshots of the simulations . for small thermal noise case ( figure [ thermal_noise_snapshots](a),(b ) ) , we can observe many micelles with sharp interfaces . for large thermal noise case used in section [ results ] ( figure [ thermal_noise_snapshots](c),(d ) )",
    "we can observe the collision - coalescence type coarsening process of micelles , driven by the thermal noise .",
    "for larger thermal noise case ( figure [ thermal_noise_snapshots](e),(f ) ) no structures are observed .",
    "( we consider this is because the thermal noise is too large . )",
    "thus we can conclude that the large ( but not too large ) thermal noise is required .",
    "this result is consistent with the proposition of van vlimmeren et al @xcite .",
    "they carried out two dimensional simulations for dense amphiphilic triblock copolymer solutions , with the full ( large ) noise and the reduced ( small ) noise and proposed that the real systems should have some intermediate noise ( smaller than the full noise , but larger than the reduced noise ) .",
    "it should be noted that simulations with small thermal noise is very difficult to perform for our systems , because they are in the strong segregation region .",
    "the simulation with the small noise shows strong lattice anisotropy .",
    "this means that there are very sharp interfaces which often leads numerical instability , and thus we should use finer lattices for such systems . on the other hand , we do not observe such strong lattice anisotropy in the simulations with large noise .",
    "we believe that the large thermal noise stirs the density fields and stabilizes the simulation .    at the end of this section",
    ", we note that it is difficult to determine the parameter @xmath64 theoretically .",
    "the estimation of the magnitude of the thermal noise is the open problem .",
    "next we discuss about the relation between the simulation results and the experiments .",
    "we used many parameters for the simulations and they should be related to the real experimental parameters . unfortunately , because the accuracy of our theory is not high and many approximations are involved , it is difficult to calculate the real parameters from our simulation parameters .",
    "the most important parameters are the flory - huggins @xmath23 parameters .",
    "the @xmath23 parameters are experimentally measured or calculated from the solubility parameters .",
    "the @xmath23 parameter between the hydrophilic subchain and the hydrophobic subchain is in most cases sufficiently large to cause the microphase separation .",
    "for example , bhargava et al @xcite calculated the @xmath23 parameter between polystyrene ( ps ) , which can be used as the hydrophobic monomer @xcite , and water as @xmath142 .",
    "dormidontova @xcite measured the @xmath23 parameter between poly(ethyrene oxide ) ( peo ) and water and reported that the @xmath23 parameter can be expressed as @xmath143 ( @xmath5 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "lam and goldbeck - wood @xcite also measured @xmath144 and obtained @xmath145 .",
    "xu et al @xcite measured the interaction between ps and peo and reported @xmath146 .",
    "zhu et al @xcite also measured @xmath147 and and obtained @xmath148 . the polymerization index of ps - peo diblock copolymer used in the experiments",
    "@xcite is typically @xmath149 , thus we expect that @xmath150 is sufficiently larger than the critical value @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "note that the polyelectrolytes such as poly(acrylic acid ) ( paa ) is often used as the hydrophilic subchian @xcite .",
    "such polyelectrolytes can be dissolved into water easily , and thus we expect the @xmath23 parameter between the polyelectrolytes and the water is negative .",
    "thus we can say the diblock copolymers are in strong segregation region , and the effect of water addition is expected to be large for hydrophobic subchains , but not so large for hydrophilic subchains .",
    "thus we consider that our simulation is qualitatively consistent with these experiments .",
    "note that , however , we can not compare the @xmath23 parameter used in the simulations and measured by experiments directly because the value of the @xmath23 parameter depends on the definition of the segment , and our free energy functional is not quantitatively accurate as the scf theory @xcite .",
    "we also note that most experiments are carried out in the very strong segregation region in which it is quite hard to perform continuum field simulations .",
    "while it is difficult to compare our simulations with real experiments , our simulations are expected to give qualitatively correct physical process since our simulations take the crucial physical properties correctly ; the hydrophobic interaction @xmath127 is sufficiently large and the hydrophilic interaction @xmath126 is small .",
    "these properties are not well considered in most of previous dynamics simulations .",
    "other interesting properties are the size of the vesicles , the content of solvents inside vesicles , or the higher order structures .",
    "these properties can not be discussed from our current results , since the system size is not large .",
    "we have only one vesicle in the simulation box ( figures [ vesicle_formation_snapshots],[vesicle_formation_snapshots2 ] and [ vesicle_formation_snapshots3 ] ) and there may be the finite size effect ( see also appendix [ finite_size_effect ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe our model and simulation results are still valuable . these properties of vesicles should be observed if we perform the simulations for large systems while it is too difficult to perform large scale simulations by the current models , algorithms and cpu power .",
    "the characteristic time scales are also interesting and important property .",
    "as mentioned above , the real time scale can be estimated from the diffusion data . here",
    "we estimate the time scale by using the empirical equation for diffusion coefficient of short polystyrene melts ( at @xmath152 ) by watanabe and kotaka @xcite .",
    "@xmath153 where @xmath154 is the molecular weight .",
    "we have to determine the number of monomers in one segment used in our simulations . since the polymerization index of typical amphiphilic block copolymers used in experiments @xcite are about @xmath155 , we consider that each segment used in simulations contains about @xmath156 monomer units . in our simulations , we used dimensionless segment size ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "thus we also need the size of the segment .",
    "the segment size of the styrene monomer is about @xmath157 ( it can be calculated from the experimental data of the radius of gyration@xcite ) .",
    "so if we assume the gaussian statistics for monomers in the segment , size of the segment can be expressed as @xmath158 .",
    "now we can estimate the characteristic time scale for the system .",
    "if we assume that the polymer chains are not entangled and obey the rouse dynamics , the characteristic time scale @xmath159 can be calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath160 @xmath161 is the size of the segment and @xmath35 is the number of segments in one polymer chain ( polymerization index ) , and @xmath162 is the diffusion coefficient . @xmath35 and @xmath154",
    "can be related as @xmath163 and thus we have @xmath164 thus we know that the characteristic time scale in our simulations are about @xmath1 microsecond , and the time scale of the vesicle formation is about @xmath156 milliseconds .",
    "of course the time scale estimated here is quite rough and can not be compared with real experiments directly , but the time scale of our simulation is considered to be much smaller than one of experiments .",
    "the possible reasons are that the accuracy of the dynamic equation used for the simulation is not so good , and that the sizes of the formed vesicles are small since the system size is small .",
    "we compare our simulation results with epd simulation results and discuss the reason why the epd simulations @xcite and our df simulations give qualitatively different results ( the mechanism ii and the mechanism i ) .",
    "the main difference between the epd simulations and our df simulations are the free energy functional model and the dynamic equation .",
    "the epd simulations use the free energy calculated from the scf theory while the df simulations use the free energy functional .",
    "it is known that the df theory is less accurate than the scf theory , but gives qualitatively acceptable results @xcite .",
    "thus it is difficult to consider that the accuracy of the free energy model affect the observed mechanisms .",
    "we expect that the mechanism i is reproduced if we change the free energy functional model from eq to more accurate scf model .",
    "other difference is the dynamic equation .",
    "the epd model employs nonlocal mobility model , but in the derivation of the dynamic equation , rather rough approximations are involved @xcite .",
    "because of these approximations , the local mass conservation is not satisfied in the epd simulations ( unless the system is homogeneous )",
    ". this may affect the dynamic behaviour seriously .",
    "the mobility in our dynamic equation is the local type , and thus it is considered to be less accurate than the nonlocal model .",
    "but in our dynamic equation , local mass conservation is satisfied exactly .",
    "thus we consider that the epd simulations reproduce the mechanism ii because it does not satisfy the local mass conservation .",
    "we expect that if the dynamic equation which satisfy the local mass conservation is used with nonlocal mobility and the scf free energy , the mechanism i should be reproduced .",
    "we have shown that we can reproduce the vesicle formation mechanism i by the simulation using the dynamic density functional equation and the free energy functional .",
    "the simulation results are qualitatively in agreement with other simulations @xcite .",
    "this is the first realistic vesicle formation dynamics simulation based on the field theoretical model . to reproduce the mechanism i",
    ", we need the free energy functional which can be applied to strong segregation regions , the large thermal noise , and the proper interaction parameters for hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions .",
    "these conditions are not satisfied previous field theoretical dynamic simulations .",
    "we have also shown that the formation dynamics of various micellar structures ( spherical micelles , cylindrical micelles , vesicles , bilayers ) and morphological transitions can be simulated by our model .",
    "the morphological transitions can be reproduced only by changing the @xmath23 parameter which corresponds to the change of the solvent condition .",
    "the merit of using the field theoretical approach is that we can use the flory - huggins interaction parameters , instead of potentials between segments which is required for particle simulations .",
    "we have shown that we can mimic the solvent condition control by changing the @xmath23 parameter between the hydrophobic segment and the solvent and have shown that the solvent condition control actually causes morphological transitions . for coarse grained particle simulations , we can not use the microscopic potential directly , and in most cases the phenomenological potential models are used .",
    "of course for some particle simulations , such as the dpd , we can use the @xmath23 parameters by mapping them onto the dpd potential parameters .",
    "but such method is based on the parameter fitting @xcite and not always justified .",
    "thus we consider that especially for many component systems , such as solutions of amphiphiles , the field theoretical approaches have advantages .",
    "although the @xmath23 parameters in the current model can not be compared with the experiments directly , our data may help understanding experimental data or the physical mechanism .",
    "it will be possible to use the experimentally determined @xmath23 parameters by employing more accurate free energy model such as the scf model @xcite and efficient numerical algorithms .",
    "( we note that recently honda and kawakatsu @xcite proposed the hybrid theory of the df and the scf and reported that accurate and numerically efficient simulations can be performed by the hybrid method . by employing their method , accurate and fast simulations for the dynamics of micelles and vesicles may be possible . ) the quantitative simulations will be the future work .    while the efficiency of our simulation method based on the density functional theory ( eqs and ) is larger than the scf simulations , currently it is still comparable to particle simulations .",
    "besides , because the late stage of the mechanism i is a very slow process , the current model still need considerable computational costs . to study the late stage dynamics or large scale systems ( for example , many vesicle systems )",
    ", we will need more coarse grained and numerically more efficient computational methods",
