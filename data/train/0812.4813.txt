    "recent observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) suggest that long duration grbs and type ib / c supernova ( sn ) explosions are tightly connected .",
    "for example , sn1998bw was observed in the positional error box of grb980425 @xcite . in this case",
    "the grb / sn association was based on the spatial and temporal coincidence of both events .",
    "the most remarkable example of long grb / sn link came in 2003 , when the spectra of both the grb030329 afterglow and of the sn2003dh were measured , since the burst happened closeby and it was quite bright .",
    "the supernova spectrum , which includes many complex lines , gradually appeared from the decaying afterglow spectrum after a few tens of days from the burst .",
    "the spectrum of sn2003dh after about a month from the explosion is quite similar with that of sn1998bw at the same stage .",
    "both sn1998bw and sn2003dh are type ic supernovae @xcite whose progenitor had lost the hydrogen and the helium envelopes during the pre - supernova stage .",
    "they are also categorized within a special class of supernova explosions , so - called hypernovae , whose explosion energy is about ten times higher , i.e. , @xmath6 , than that of ordinary supernova . indeed , our common view is that most long - lasting grbs are produced by core - collapse supernovae akin to sn1998bw .",
    "grbs are not exclusively linked to hypernovae .",
    "for instance , the long lasting burst ( @xmath7 s ) grb060218 ( or xrf060218 ) was associated with the type ic , which is not a hypernova .",
    "the explosion energy falls within the regular range for type ic events @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the progenitor star may not form a black hole but a neutron star , since the estimated mass of the progenitor during the main sequence is @xmath8 . on the other hand , there are recent examples of cases of long - lasting grbs ( and ) where no supernova signature was observed at all even if , considering the distance , the observational trace of a supernova should have been detected @xcite .    though a variety of long duration grbs which have a strong connection with sns are observed , we still lack of a complete picture of the processes by which a sizable fraction of the energy involved in a type ib / c sn explosion is tapped in a relatively narrow channel , and produces a grb at a large distance from the original site of generation .",
    "@xcite proposed that the death of massive stars can be an origin of grbs .",
    "@xcite introduced the collapsar model to account for the progenitor system of long grbs . according to this model",
    ", a non - spherical outflow could be formed from the deep inside of the progenitor where a black hole or a proto - neutron star is born as a result of the collapse of the iron core @xcite .",
    "if the specific angular momentum of the iron core is sufficiently large , an accretion torus may develop around the central compact object .",
    "the system formed by a central object and an accretion disk has the potential to launch a bipolar outflow .",
    "the mechanisms proposed to extract energy out of such central engines are basically two ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : thermal or hydromagnetic .",
    "thermal mechanisms rely on depositing a considerable amount of thermal energy in the vicinity of the rotation axis of the system , just above the poles of the central compact object , where a low density funnel has develop in the course of the evolution .",
    "the accretion energy of the hot torus is converted into a copious flux of neutrinos @xmath9 and anti - neutrinos @xmath10 . from the @xmath11-annihilation a hot @xmath12-plasma results . in its turn , @xmath12-pairs annihilate yielding a _ fireball _ of high energy photons .",
    "the conversion of the thermal energy of the fireball into kinetic energy partly determines the subsequent evolution of the plasma .",
    "it accelerates to ultrarelativistic speeds ( reaching lorentz factors of @xmath13 @xcite ) while , at the same time , interacts with the progenitor system .",
    "alternatively , mhd process may tap a fraction of the rotational energy of the bh or of the accretion disk to form an outflow @xcite .",
    "a number of works have dealt with the hydrodynamic properties of the outflows generated in collapsar progenitors as they propagate through the progenitor system ( and in some cases beyond the surface of the progenitor star ) .",
    "the problem is addressed by means of numerical relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with different degrees of complexity ( @xcite ) , which assume that a quasi - steady momentum flux has been produced at a certain distance from the region where the energy is released ( independent of which is the actual energy extraction mechanism -mhd or thermal- ) .",
    "therefore , such numerical works assume the existence of a nozzle through which the injection of a supersonic jet is produced , and put their focus on the modification of the morphology and of the dynamics of collimated outflows as they travel through the progenitor star .",
    "depending on the exact inflow conditions , a variety of different outflows result .",
    "for instance , @xcite finds a whole spectrum of outflows ranging from collimated , relativistic jets to poorly collimated expanding winds .",
    "thus , @xcite argue that such a variety of resulting outflows supports the idea that the same collapsar scenario can yield a number of different phenomena ( in agreement with the previous ideas of unification of high energy transients , e.g. , @xcite ) , such as , grbs , x - ray rich grbs , x - ray flashes , and normal supernovae .    in the prompt grb phase we observe the emission of high energy photons from an ultrarelativistic outflow , which is generated at a distance @xmath14 cm , very far from the central engine .",
    "due to the large optical thickness of the outflow at scales comparable to that of the progenitor , we have not observed any electromagnetic emission directly from the progenitor so far , except , perhaps , some precursor activity @xcite . since the direct detection of progenitors of grbs is nowadays impossible ( if they happen at cosmological distances ) , the observation of the association between grbs and sne probably provides the best clue to understand the progenitors of the grbs . though more than 100 grbs per year are identified , most of them occur far away .",
    "thus , it is technically impossible to identify their accompanying supernovae .",
    "another clue regarding the nature of the grb progenitors comes from the environment and the host galaxies in which the burst takes place .",
    "both clues indicate that long - duration grbs are associated with the death of the most massive stars @xcite .",
    "the typical hosts of long grbs are star - forming , low metallicity galaxies ( with an star formation rate @xmath15y@xmath3 ; @xcite ) but bluer than typical starburst galaxies , with little dust @xcite , and lower masses than current ellipticals , i.e. , they correspond to the typical environments of formation of massive stars .",
    "@xcite also conclude , that the host galaxies of the grbs are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "a very interesting question is weather it is possible to get any information on the nature of a grb progenitor from the observation of the afterglow emission .",
    "one possibility is to look at the angular distribution of integrated energy per unit of solid angle , as observed in the afterglow phase of the burst .",
    "@xcite estimated theoretically such an angular distribution assuming , that the kinetic energy of the jet is converted to thermal energy in the cocoon , till the head of the jet reaches the progenitor surface .",
    "the cocoon originates from jet material which crosses through the terminal strong shock of the collimated outflow and moves away from the center of the progenitor surrounding the beam of the jet .",
    "a fat cocoon develops for light jets , i.e. , jets whose rest - mass density is much lower than that of the ambient gas into which the jet propagates .",
    "when the jet breaks out the progenitor surface , the thermal energy is released to a low - density inter stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite concluded , that the energy distribution per solid angle ( @xmath16 ) of the jet displays a @xmath17 dependence with the viewing angle after its eruption through the progenitor surface .",
    "recently , @xcite have used hydrodynamic simulations to test the theoretical prediction of @xcite , and found that their numerical models do not follow the inferred theoretical angular energy distribution .    in this paper",
    "we also try to verify the analytic relation for the angular dependence of the energy with the polar angle that was proposed by @xcite .",
    "we explore a parameter space different from that of @xcite in order to compute the dependence of the angular energy distribution on the structure of the progenitor .",
    "the progenitor models are built upon the pre - supernova models of @xcite . along the way",
    ", we also characterize the hydrodynamic properties of relativistic jets propagating through different progenitor stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    ", the metallicity of the progenitor strongly affects the evolution of the angular momentum distribution at the pre - supernova stage , in such a way , that low metallicity is preferred to obtain a large angular momentum in the core of the progenitor .    for the purposes of this work",
    ", we employ some of the pre - supernova models computed by @xcite .",
    "we stick to the same naming convention than the former authors , and consider several sets of models ( tab .  [",
    "tab : progenitor ] ) .",
    "the first group corresponds to the he16-series of 16 models of @xcite , which include progenitor stars for which @xmath18 bare helium cores are evolved , that have solar metallicity , and different amounts of initial angular momentum , dynamo effects , mass - loss rates , etc .",
    "the last three models of tab .  [ tab : progenitor ] , 16oc , 16 tb , and 16tc form the second group of progenitors .",
    "they correspond to stars with the same initial mass as those of the first group but with a smaller metallicity ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the second set of low - metallicity models has been chosen among the many other possibilities available because their radius , at the pre - supernova stage , are the smallest among all other low - metallicity progenitors ( in all cases , their stellar radii are @xmath21 cm ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dradialmass ] shows the radial mass profiles of the models he16c , he16l , and he16n .",
    "he16c is representative of progenitors whose pre - supernova mass is small @xmath22 ( due to the vigorous mass loss rate in the late phases of its evolution ; tab .",
    "[ tab : progenitor ] ) .",

    "we will refer to this group as type - l .",
    "the model he16n belongs to the group of more massive progenitors ( @xmath23 ) , to which we will refer as type - h models .",

    "[ tab : progenitor ] ) .",
    "we neglect for the progenitors any deviation from spherical symmetry arising from the rotation of the models .",
    "therefore , for the study we present here , each progenitor differs from the other mainly in its total mass , radius , and mass density profile at the pre - supernova stage .            though a nonspherical structure is expected around the black hole due to the rapid rotation of the progenitor",
    ", it is reasonable to assume spherical symmetry for the envelopes of the progenitor for radial distances @xmath26 cm , which is where we put the innermost radial boundary in the numerical simulations of this study .",
    "thus , we only take from the models of @xcite the radial density and the radial velocity profiles which result by the end of the pre - supernova evolution .",
    "we assume that the pressure of the progenitor is very low , or , equivalently , that the initial specific internal energy ( @xmath27 ) is set to be very low ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the speed of light ) .",
    "both the gravitational force produced by the central compact object , and the progenitor self gravity are ignored , since the timescale for the outflows to cross the progenitor and to break out from the surface of the progenitor , @xmath30s , is much shorter than free fall timescale for the stellar envelopes .",
    "we extend the radial mass density profile to the outside of the progenitor up to the outer computational boundary located at @xmath31 cm .",
    "for the models which barely loose mass during the latest stages of their evolution , the rest - mass density is assumed to be uniform @xmath32 and much smaller than that at the progenitor surface .",
    "if the progenitor star has a non - null mass loss rate ( i.e. , if the parameter @xmath33 , according to the nomenclature of @xcite ) , we take a @xmath34 dependence in radial mass - density profiles from the surface of the progenitor ( see fig .",

    "the polar grid has @xmath47 grid points uniformly spaced in the range @xmath48 , ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we use the same 2d special relativistic hydrodynamic code of @xcite to perform our simulations .",
    "the code provides 3rd order accuracy in both space and time , by applying a ppm intra - cell interpolation and a tvd - runge kutta time integration . for the sake of simplicity",

    "we assume that a jet has been generated by the central engine , and that at a certain distance , quasi - steady injection conditions are settled through a well defined circular nozzle .",
    "thus , we inject plasma , in the radial direction , through the innermost radial boundary at @xmath54 in a cone of half - opening angle @xmath55 .",
    "the jet injection proceeds for a period @xmath56s .",
    "we parametrize the outflowing plasma by assuming that it is hot ( we set @xmath57 ) and moderately relativistic ( the lorentz factor being @xmath58 ) .",
    "we adopt the convention that the parameters of the outflow at the injection point are named with a subscript j. because of the conversion of thermal - to - kinetic energy , the injected flows have the potential to accelerate to bulk lorentz factors larger than 100 @xcite . during the first 3s",
    ", the power of the injected outflow is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the area of the injection surface , @xmath61 is the specific enthalpy , and @xmath62 is the radial component of the 3-velocity . the density and pressure of the injected outflow are obtained by setting @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath42 .",

    "the total injected energy is several times @xmath68erg .",
    "since the main purpose of this study is to see the jet propagation and expansion of the cocoon into the interstellar medium after the shock breakout , we adopt this power to obtain a rapid propagation of the jet in the progenitor .",
    "this fast propagation is necessary to be consistent with the fact that we neglect the self - gravity of the star .",
    "if the jet crosses the progenitor much faster than the typical hydrodynamic timescale in the system , the progenitor remains roughly unchanged during the complete jet propagation through it and , therefore , we do not need to care about the progenitor evolution during such short timescales .",
    "after the initial phase of constant kinetic power injection , both the kinetic power and the injection lorentz factor are linearly decreased according to the laws @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , respectively , for @xmath71 . in this period of decaying injection power ,",

    "after @xmath73s , the flow injection ceases .    with",
    "the parametrization considered above , the rest - mass density ( @xmath74 ) during the constant power phase is 154g@xmath75 .",
    "since the rest - mass density of the progenitor around the inner computational boundary is @xmath76g@xmath75 , the injected outflow is initially much lighter than medium in which it is injected .",
    "thus it is expected that the jet propagation velocity across the progenitor is smaller than the speed of light , and one naturally expects to generate relatively thick cocoons surrounding the beam of the jet .",
    "the dynamical evolution of our jet models can be split in two phases .",
    "the first one happens during the period in which the jet drills its way through the progenitor star .",

    "[ fig : contour1_2 ] ]    although the outflow has a finite initial opening angle , the the beam of the jet is almost parallel to the polar axis .",

    "is risen to a much higher value than in the beam , it expands and flows back in a thick cocoon .",
    "the high pressure of the cocoon is the responsible for the beam collimation during the initial phase of propagation inside of the progenitor star .",
    "also during this early stage of the evolution , a strong backflow can be seen flanking the beam of the jet .",
    "some vortices develop between the jet and the backflow caused by the growth of kelvin - helmholtz modes .",
    "an schematic view of this process can be seen in fig .",
    "5a of @xcite .",
    "the propagation of the jet inside the progenitor also drives a cavity limited by a shroud whose density and pressure is larger than in the cocoon .",
    "the shroud is swept up by a reverse shock that results from the interaction between the cavity and the progenitor envelope . however , this reverse shock is not strong enough to rise the temperature above the threshold in which nuclear reactions can take place .",
    "after the jet breaks out the progenitor surface , it proceeds to the ism , which is assumed to be rarefied for model he16n . in this phase ,",
    "cocoon is almost freely released into the ism , because of the negligible pressure of the external medium ( fig .",

    "the beam has accelerated to @xmath82 ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : acceleration ] ) and , thus , it has entered into a ballistic regime , where lateral expansion is strongly suppressed . thereby , the jet remains well collimated as it propagates through the ism , and the half - opening angle of the beam reaches only a few degrees .",

    "note that this result differs a bit from models where the generation of the outflow is considered @xcite . if jet injection conditions are set through a nozzle at a certain distance to the center , the variability imprinted by the highly dynamical generation of the jet is erased .",

    "differently , @xcite , who injected the jet parallel to the polar axis of the progenitor , did not find such a fast acceleration . in the later case ,",
    "the occurrence of recollimation shocks much closer to the injection nozzle prevents the development a freely expanding , unshocked jet extending so far away as in the models of this work .",

    "first , we assume that a fix fraction ( the same everywhere ) of the total energy ( internal plus kinetic ) will be converted into electromagnetic radiation .",
    "basically , this assumption is equivalent to state that the angular profile of the observed non - thermal radiation is simply a scaled version of the total energy angular profile .",
    "certainly , this is a rough approximation , since the non - thermal radiation from @xmath99-rays to radio frequencies will be produced by synchrotron ( and , perhaps , inverse compton ) processes of particles accelerated at shocks ( or , maybe , along the jet boundary layer ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , there are shocks of very different properties in the ultrarelativistic beam and in the cocoon and , thus , we may expect somewhat different conversion efficiencies of the outflow energy into radiation in the beam and in the cocoon .",
    "finally , we assume that the angular energy distribution is _ frozen - in _ by the time when the head of the jet reaches the outer computational boundary .",
    "as commented above , our models evolve almost self - similarly a bit after they break out of the stellar surface , and therefore , we expect only a minor time evolution of the angular profiles of @xmath16 .",
    "we point out that the procedure we use to estimate @xmath16 differs from that of @xcite , who derived their @xmath16 profiles from the time integration of the energy flux trough a certain radius . under the hypothesis of self - similar evolution , this is equivalent to integrate , along the radial direction , the energy density of our models ( by the time they reach @xmath44 ) as follows , @xmath100 where the subscripts @xmath101 and @xmath102 are associated to the spherical grid coordinates @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively , and @xmath105 and @xmath83 are the radial velocity in units of @xmath29 and the observer s viewing angle ( measured from the jet axis ) , respectively .",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : dedomega ] ) includes the radiation contributions coming from regions outside of the line of sight ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the summation in the radial direction runs from the surface of the progenitor , located at @xmath106 or , equivalently , @xmath107 , to the outermost boundary .",
    "the summation in the azimuthal angle runs from @xmath108 to @xmath109 ( note that due to the assumed axial symmetry , we can copy the computed data of the quadrant @xmath110 to the quadrant @xmath111 ) . in order to avoid accounting for subrelativistic regions , which will not contribute to the afterglow energetics",

    "the absolute value of the observed @xmath115 along every radial direction forming an angle @xmath83 with the polar axis depends , among other things , on two parameters whose exact value is not well constrained , neither by observations nor by the present day theory .",

    "the deviation from the spb function in this angular range is due to the contribution of the expanding , mildly relativistic cocoon .",
    "this cocoon contribution shows up more clearly ( the energy distribution tends to flatten in the range @xmath133 ) if we lower the thresholds on the values of @xmath134 and @xmath62 used to compute the angular energy distribution of each model .",
    "however , as we argued before , lowering these thresholds too much will catch up contributions from numerical cells whose asymptotic lorentz factor is too small to account for typical afterglow .",

    "[ fig : distri2 ] inset ) shows a faster decay of @xmath16 than type - h models for @xmath138 .",
    "the reason for this difference is the much deeper density drop of low - metallicity models close to the star surface ( fig .",

    "there is roughly a linear dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath142 , which displays a relatively large dispersion .",
    "the reason for the dispersion being that for very similar values of the total progenitor mass , the rest - mass density radial profiles can be appreciably different ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ fig:1dradialmass ] and [ fig:1dradialmass2 ] ) .",

    "the differences in the propagation velocity of the injected jets are set , to a large extend , by the differences in the average density between progenitors of different mass .",
    "the less massive progenitors of our sample ( type - l models ) tend to have the smaller average densities ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:1dradialmass ] , where model he16c displays a smaller density than model he16n at every radial point ) .",
    "consistently , jets propagating in type - l progenitors are faster as can be observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : average_velo ] .",
    "however , the time needed to reach the progenitor surface presents a dependence with the progenitor mass with a much larger scatter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_cross ] ) .",
    "particularly , models he16a , he16f , he16 g and he16h , all of which belong to the type - h group , display a progenitor crossing time comparable to that of the jets in the type - l group ( although its average propagation velocity is comparable to that of models of type - h ) . that s the reason why these models appear as _ outliers _ in the correlations between the slope @xmath152 and the progenitor mass ( figs .  [ fig : mass_al ] and with the mass - loss rate ( fig .  [ fig : massloss_al ] ) .",
    "since more massive progenitor stars yield hotter cocoons , once the cocoon is erupted through the stellar surface , it undergoes a larger lateral expansion ( compare models he16c and he16n in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1dradialmass ] ) , i.e. , the energy carried by the jet spreads towards lower latitudes .",

    "this fact explains the larger lateral expansion after shock break out in model he16n than in model he16c .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ]    if we assume that the detectability of an event , for an observer looking such event at a certain viewing angle ( @xmath83 ) , is proportional to @xmath157 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it turns out that @xmath83 should be rather small ( @xmath158 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : detecta ] ) to observe and event produced in collapsar progenitors ( note that the flanks of @xmath146 distribution are quite steep and , thus , it is very unlikely to detect events which are not directly pointing towards the observer ) .",

    ", compare the profiles of models he16c and he16n in fig .",
    "[ fig : detecta ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is more unlikely to detect off - axis events produced in light progenitors than in more massive ones .",
    "alternatively , we may state the the lower degree of collimation of relativistic jets in high - mass stars results in a higher probability of observing an event from a high - mass progenitor than a low - mass progenitor .",
    "we also find that the metallicity has little influence on the observability , because for similar progenitor masses , solar - metallicity models and low metallicity ones display almost identical observability angular profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detecta ] ) .",
    "we also notice the very different observability profiles of jets produced in collapsars and jets produced in remnants of mergers of compact objects . in the latter case ,",
    "a non - negligible observability is obtained in the viewing angle interval @xmath159 , because of the larger half - opening angles of the outflows originated in progenitors of short grbs ( see fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "another relevant difference is that collapsar - jets show a detectability with a fast rise close to @xmath160 , followed by a shallower decay beyond the most probable detection angle @xmath161 .",
    "in contrast , most jets produced in merger remnants tend to decay very abruptly beyond the most likely observing angle , and have an observability rise much more moderate than that of collapsar - jets .",
    "the reason for this difference is the much shallower decay of the isotropic equivalent energy at the flanks of the beam in collapsar - jets than in jets from merger remnants .",
    "in this paper we explore the relation of the dynamical properties of ultrarelativistic jets generated in collapsars with the properties of the progenitor stars in which such jets propagate .",
    "we have particularly focused on the correlations that exist between the angular profile of the energy per solid angle ( as seen in the afterglow phase ) and the properties of the progenitors . along the way",
    ", we have pointed out which is the relevance of the fact that our numerical models are set up with a finite injection half - opening angle .",
    "using a non - zero injection angle affects the way in which the conversion of internal - to - kinetic energy takes place .",
    "if the flow is injected parallel to the polar axis , the development of reconfinement shocks happens closer to the injection nozzle than if the flow is injected radially within a cone of finite half - opening angle .",
    "when the recollimation shock occurs far away from the nozzle , the unshocked beam flow accelerates along a larger distance in a rarefaction that precedes such shock .",
    "thus , the beam reaches there larger lorentz factors than if the jet is injected parallel to the polar axis .",
    "the dissipation in cross shocks acts by simply recycling part of the kinetic energy of the outflow into thermal energy .",
    "the thermal energy is not lost , since the jet propagation is roughly adiabatic inside of the progenitor ( radiation losses are negligible there ) . instead",
    ", this thermal energy can be further converted into kinetic energy at larger distances .",
    "this process may happen several times before the outflow becomes transparent and radiation can freely escape .",
    "this explains why , in spite of the differences in the beam dynamics , all models ( independent of the injection half - opening angle ; c.f .",
    ", @xcite ) develop a roughly similar propagation speed and , by the time they reach the head of the jet , the gross properties of the outflow are similar .",
    "we have estimated the angular distribution of energy per solid angle in the afterglow phase by extrapolation of the state of our models when they reach a distance of @xmath162 cm .",
    "this extrapolation relies on the fact that the jets develop a rough self - similar behavior soon after they emerge from the progenitor surface .",
    "our results show that the equivalent isotropic energy per solid angle @xmath163 is only partly consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "however , the results in this paper do appear to be consistent with previous numerical simulations such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtain that the angular energy distribution displays a relatively flat core which is flanked by a region where @xmath164 .",
    "our results show that the core of the distribution ( close to @xmath36 ) is not flat ( but decays as @xmath165 ) and that the energy per solid angle decays much faster than @xmath17 ( it does it as @xmath166 , with a value of @xmath167 depending on the mass of the progenitor ; see below ) .",
    "we can fit the @xmath146-data with sbp functions up to @xmath168 . at smaller latitudes ,",
    "a simple power - law with a slope close to @xmath169 fits better the data . in this region ( @xmath170 )",
    ", the cocoon contribution is the dominant ( at smaller values of @xmath83 , the beam of the jet dominates the energetics ) , and we find there the best consistency with the model of @xcite .    we have correlated the properties of the angular @xmath163 distribution of the jet with the fundamental parameters of the progenitor star in which the jet has propagated . we find that the shape of the distribution is mostly influenced by the mass of the progenitor .",
    "when the mass of the progenitor is small ( @xmath171 ) , because of the occurrence of large mass losses due to winds in the latest stages of the star s evolution , then @xmath146 decays faster with @xmath83 than if the mass of the progenitor is large ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we find that the reason for this behavior is that the average density of the progenitors tends to grow ( approximately ) with the mass .",
    "this means that the average jet propagation speed inside of the star is smaller , the larger is the mass . a smaller jet propagation speed results into thicker and hotter cocoons , since we fix the same mass , momentum and energy fluxes at the nozzle for all models .",
    "also the beam of the jet in the more massive progenitors is wider .",
    "this is the reason why low mass progenitors develop narrower @xmath146 profiles than high mass ones .",
    "the difference in the collimation of the energy distributions resulting from low and high mass progenitors has a direct influence on the number of observed events .",
    "we expect to see more events produced in heavy progenitors than in low mass ones .",
    "one could question whether the correlation that we have found between the mass of the progenitor and the width of the @xmath163 is an artifact of our numerical set up .",
    "we are fixing the luminosity of the jet to be the same independent of the progenitor mass .",
    "however , progenitors of different mass may develop central engines which release different power .",
    "a good proxy of the power of the central engine is the mass of the iron core of the progenitor .",
    "one may expect that the collapse of more massive iron cores results into larger central compact objects .",
    "if the power released by the central engine is dominated by the size of the central compact object , then models with more massive iron cores could release a larger power than models with low mass cores .",
    "then , how do we justify our numerical assumption that the power injected in the jet is roughly independent of the progenitor s mass ? . in support of our point",
    "we argue that , first , according to @xcite data , there is not a one to one correlation between the mass of the iron core and the mass of the progenitor and , second , the iron mass varies by less than a 30% in all the models considered here , while the total mass can be different by a factor of 3 .",
    "thus , within the simplifications we do in our models , the assumption of a common luminosity independent of the mass of the progenitor is justified .",
    "irrespective of these two arguments , if heavier progenitors would result into more luminous central engines , we shall point out that this trend will also result into wider jets and cocoons .",
    "this is a result early pointed out by @xcite , were it was shown that , taking the same progenitor , but increasing the luminosity of the central engine by a factor of 10 , results into thicker cocoons than in cases in which the luminosity is more moderate .",
    "the reason being that the release of a large power triggers large amplitude kelvin - helmholtz instabilities at the basis of the outflow , which transfer a large fraction of the momentum of the beam to a thicker shear layer between the beam and the cocoon . effectively , this process widens the cross sectional area of the beam , reducing its propagation speed and , consistently inflating larger cocoons .",
    "we have also found , that comparing progenitors of similar mass , the metallicity of the star has a small impact on the extrapolated @xmath146 profiles .",
    "the collimation of the jet is similar regardless of the stellar metallicity .",
    "however , the cocoon is more narrowly collimated in low - metallicity stars , because of the large density drop close to their surfaces .",
    "this reduced density makes the jets in low - metallicity stars much more ballistic , once they break out the stellar surface , than in solar - metallicity progenitors .",
    "unfortunately , this difference might not be observable , since it happens in regions where the energy per solid angle is much smaller than at the jet core ( unless orphan afterglows could be detected ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we have found significant differences between the @xmath146 profiles of collapsar - jets and those of jets produced in merger remnants ( i.e. , between the angular energy distribution of jets associated to long and to short grbs ) .",
    "collapsar - jets are more narrowly collimated than jets of merger remnants , and the decay of @xmath146 beyond the central flat core is much steeper in the latter than in the former .",
    "this intrinsic difference manifest itself as a larger chance of detectability of jets from merger remnants at viewing angles up to @xmath173 , while , on the other hand , collapsar - jets could hardly be seen off - axis .",

    "the polar grid possesses a uniform region close to the symmetry axis ( @xmath177 ) , where @xmath178 , followed by a uniformly spaced region in @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the reason to consider two different regions in the @xmath83-spacing is that all our jet models develop cocoons whose angular extension is @xmath181 , i.e. , all the dynamics develops in a wedge covered by a finer mesh in our computational grid .",
    "thus , an increased resolution in the abovementioned wedge surrounding the polar axis yields an effective increase of the numerical resolution in the whole computational grid .",
    "even higher resolution models ( he16c - h , he16l - h , and he16n - h ) have also been computed . in this case , the grid consists of @xmath182 zones uniformly spaced in @xmath39 , with a minimum radial grid spacing @xmath183 cm , i.e. , one half of the width of smallest radial spacing of the standard resolution case .",

    "<S> collapsars are fast - spinning , massive stars , whose core collapse liberates an energy , that can be channeled in the form of ultrarelativistic jets . </S>",
    "<S> these jets transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances , where it is dissipated in the form of long - duration gamma - ray bursts . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars . </S>",
    "<S> also we extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the produced outflows in the afterglow phase . </S>",
    "<S> our main focus is to look for global energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of different progenitor stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we employ a number of pre - supernova , stellar models ( with distinct masses and metallicities ) , and inject in all of them jets with fixed initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that at the injection nozzle , the jet is mildly relativistic ( lorentz factor @xmath0 ) , has a finite half - opening angle ( @xmath1 ) , and carries a power of @xmath2ergs@xmath3 . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> well collimated jets propagate through the progenitor , blowing a high pressure and high temperature cocoon . </S>",
    "<S> these jets arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it . </S>",
    "<S> a large lorentz factor region @xmath4 develops well before the jet reaches the surface of the star , in the unshocked part of the beam , located between the injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock . </S>",
    "<S> these high values of @xmath5 are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for free expansion towards the radial direction . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong correlation between the angular energy distribution of the jet , after its eruption from the progenitor surface , and the mass of the progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the angular energy distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is also imprinted in the angular distribution of isotropic equivalent energy . </S>"
