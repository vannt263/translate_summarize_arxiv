    "at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor , dissipative electrical current is converted into dissipationless supercurrent .",
    "the mechanism for this conversion was discovered thirty years ago by a.  f.  andreev @xcite : an electron excitation slightly above the fermi level in the normal metal is reflected at the interface as a hole excitation slightly below the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "[ reflection ] ) .",
    "the missing charge of @xmath1 is removed as a supercurrent .",
    "the reflected hole has ( approximately ) the same momentum as the incident electron .",
    "( the two momenta are precisely equal at the fermi level . )",
    "the velocity of the hole is minus the velocity of the electron ( cf .",
    "the notion of a hole as a `` time - reversed '' electron ) .",
    "this curious scattering process is known as retro - reflection or _",
    "andreev reflection_.    the early theoretical work on the conductance of a normal - metal  superconductor ( ns ) junction treats the dynamics of the quasiparticle excitations _ semiclassically _ , as is appropriate for macroscopic junctions",
    ". phase coherence of the electrons and the andreev - reflected holes is ignored .",
    "interest in `` mesoscopic '' ns junctions , where phase coherence plays an important role , is a recent development .",
    "significant advances have been made during the last few years in our understanding of quantum interference effects due to phase - coherent andreev reflection .",
    "much of the motivation has come from the technological advances in the fabrication of a highly transparent contact between a superconducting film and the two - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "these systems are ideal for the study of the interplay of andreev reflection and the mesoscopic effects known to occur in semiconductor nanostructures @xcite , because of the large fermi wavelength , large mean free path , and because of the possibility to confine the carriers electrostatically by means of gate electrodes . in this series of lectures we review the present status of this rapidly developing field of research .    to appreciate the importance of phase coherence in ns junctions , consider the resistance of a normal - metal wire ( length @xmath2 , mean free path @xmath3 ) .",
    "this resistance increases monotonically with @xmath2 .",
    "now attach the wire to a superconductor via a tunnel barrier ( transmission probability @xmath4 ) .",
    "then the resistance has a _ minimum _ when @xmath5 .",
    "the minimum disappears if the phase coherence between the electrons and holes is destroyed , by increasing the voltage or by applying a magnetic field .",
    "the resistance minimum is associated with the crossover from a @xmath6 to a @xmath7 dependence on the barrier transparency .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence is as expected for tunneling into a superconductor , being a two - particle process .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence is surprising .",
    "it is as if the andreev - reflected hole can tunnel through the barrier without reflections .",
    "this socalled `` reflectionless tunneling '' requires relatively transparent ns interfaces , with @xmath8 .",
    "semiconductor  superconductor junctions are convenient , since the schottky barrier at the interface is much more transparent than a typical dielectric tunnel barrier .",
    "the technological effort is directed towards making the interface as transparent as possible . a nearly ideal ns interface ( @xmath9 ) is required if one wishes to study how andreev reflection modifies the quantum interference effects in the normal state .",
    "( for @xmath10 these are obscured by the much larger reflectionless - tunneling effect . )",
    "the modifications can be quite remarkable .",
    "we discuss two examples .",
    "the first is weak localization . in the normal state",
    ", weak localization can not be detected in the current  voltage ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) characteristic , but requires application of a magnetic field .",
    "the reason is that application of a voltage ( in contrast to a magnetic field ) does not break time - reversal symmetry . in an ns junction , however , weak localization can be detected in the @xmath11@xmath12 characteristic , because application of a voltage destroys the phase coherence between electrons and holes .",
    "the result is a small dip in @xmath13 versus @xmath12 around @xmath14 for @xmath9 .",
    "on reducing @xmath4 , the dip crosses over to a peak due to reflectionless tunneling .",
    "the peak is much larger than the dip , but the widths are approximately the same .",
    "the second example is universal conductance fluctuations . in the normal state",
    ", the conductance fluctuates from sample to sample with a variance which is independent of sample size or degree of disorder .",
    "this is one aspect of the universality .",
    "the other aspect is that breaking of time - reversal symmetry ( by a magnetic field ) reduces the variance by precisely a factor of two . in an ns junction ,",
    "the conductance fluctuations are also size and disorder independent .",
    "however , application of a time - reversal - symmetry breaking magnetic field has no effect on the magnitude .",
    "these three phenomena , weak localization , reflectionless tunneling , and universal conductance fluctuations , are discussed in sections 4 , 5 , and 6 , respectively . sections 2 and 3",
    "are devoted to a description of the theoretical method and to a few illustrative applications .",
    "the method is a scattering theory , which relates the conductance @xmath15 of the ns junction to the @xmath16 transmission matrix @xmath17 in the normal state ( @xmath18 is the number of transverse modes at the fermi level ) . in the limit of zero temperature , zero voltage , and zero magnetic field ,",
    "the relationship is @xmath19 where the transmission eigenvalue @xmath20 is an eigenvalue of the matrix product @xmath21 .",
    "the same numbers @xmath20 ( @xmath22 ) determine the conductance @xmath23 in the normal state , according to the landauer formula @xmath24 the fact that the same transmission eigenvalues determine both @xmath23 and @xmath15 means that one can use the same ( numerical and analytical ) techniques developed for quantum transport in the normal state .",
    "this is a substantial technical and conceptual simplification .",
    "the scattering theory can also be used for other transport properties , other than the conductance , both in the normal and the superconducting state .",
    "an example , discussed in section 7 , is the shot noise due to the discreteness of the carriers .",
    "a doubling of the ratio of shot - noise power to current can occur in an ns junction , consistent with the notion of cooper pair transport in the superconductor .",
    "we conclude in section 8 .    we restrict ourselves in this review ( with one exception ) to two - terminal geometries , with a single ns interface .",
    "equation ( [ gns1 ] ) , as well as the landauer formula ( [ gn1 ] ) , only describe the two - terminal conductance .",
    "more complex multi - terminal geometries , involving several ns interfaces , have been studied theoretically by lambert and coworkers @xcite , and experimentally by petrashov et al .  @xcite .",
    "since we focus on phase - coherent effects , most of our discussion concerns the linear - response regime of infinitesimal applied voltage .",
    "a recent review by klapwijk contains a more extensive coverage of the non - linear response at higher voltages @xcite .",
    "the scattering approach has also been applied to the josephson effect in sns junctions @xcite , resulting in a formula for the supercurrent  phase relationship in terms of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath20 in the normal state .",
    "we do not discuss the josephson effect here , but refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of mesoscopic sns junctions .",
    "taken together , ref .",
    "@xcite and the present work describe a unified approach to mesoscopic superconductivity .",
    "the model considered is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "it consists of a disordered normal region ( hatched ) adjacent to a superconductor ( s ) .",
    "the disordered region may also contain a geometrical constriction or a tunnel barrier . to obtain a well - defined scattering problem we insert ideal ( impurity - free ) normal leads @xmath25 and @xmath26 to the left and right of the disordered region .",
    "the ns interface is located at @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the only scattering in the superconductor consists of andreev reflection at the ns interface , i.e.  we consider the case that the disorder is contained entirely within the normal region .",
    "the spatial separation of andreev and normal scattering is the key simplification which allows us to relate the conductance directly to the normal - state scattering matrix .",
    "the model is directly applicable to a superconductor in the clean limit ( mean free path in s large compared to the superconducting coherence length @xmath28 ) , or to a point - contact junction ( formed by a constriction which is narrow compared to @xmath28 ) . in both cases",
    "the contribution of scattering within the superconductor to the junction resistance can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the scattering states at energy @xmath29 are eigenfunctions of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "this equation has the form of two schrdinger equations for electron and hole wavefunctions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , coupled by the pair potential @xmath32 @xcite : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the single - electron hamiltonian , containing an electrostatic potential @xmath35 and vector potential @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath48 drops abruptly ( over atomic distances ) to zero , in the assumed absence of any pairing interaction in the normal region . therefore , @xmath49 for @xmath50 . at the superconducting side of the ns interface",
    ", @xmath32 recovers its bulk value @xmath51 only at some distance from the interface .",
    "we will neglect the suppression of @xmath32 on approaching the ns interface , and use the step - function model @xmath52 this model is also referred to in the literature as a `` rigid boundary - condition '' .",
    "likharev @xcite discusses in detail the conditions for its validity : if the width @xmath53 of the ns junction is small compared to @xmath28 , the non - uniformities in @xmath32 extend only over a distance of order @xmath53 from the junction ( because of `` geometrical dilution '' of the influence of the narrow junction in the wide superconductor ) .",
    "since non - uniformities on length scales @xmath54 do not affect the dynamics of the quasiparticles , these can be neglected and the step - function model holds .",
    "a point contact or microbridge belongs in general to this class of junctions .",
    "alternatively , the step - function model holds also for a wide junction if the resistivity of the junction region is much bigger than the resistivity of the bulk superconductor .",
    "this condition is formulated more precisely in ref.@xcite . a semiconductor",
    " superconductor junction is typically in this second category .",
    "note that both the two cases are consistent with our assumption that the disorder is contained entirely within the normal region .",

    "the zero - frequency noise power @xmath477 is defined by @xmath478 at zero temperature , the discreteness of the electron charge is the only source of fluctuations in time of the current .",
    "these fluctuations are known as `` shot noise '' , to distinguish them from the thermal noise at non - zero temperature .",
    "a further distinction between the two is that the shot - noise power is proportional to the applied voltage , whereas the thermal noise does not vanish at @xmath14 .",

    "@xcite , the enhancement of shot noise in an ns junction .",
    "the enhancement originates from the fact that the current in the superconductor is carried by cooper pairs in units of @xmath1 .",

    "it is a consequence of the pauli principle that closed ( @xmath483 ) as well as open ( @xmath484 ) scattering channels do not fluctuate and therefore give no contribution to the shot noise . in the case of a tunnel barrier ,",
    "all transmission eigenvalues are small ( @xmath485 , for all @xmath68 ) , so that the quadratic terms in eq .",

    "in contrast , for a quantum point contact @xmath487 . since on the plateaus of quantized conductance",

    "scattering channels which have @xmath483 or @xmath484 do not contribute to the shot noise .",

    "this can be interpreted as uncorrelated current pulses of @xmath1-charged particles .",
    "consider next an ns junction with a disordered normal region , but with an ideal interface ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "we may then apply the formula ( [ avf ] ) for the average of a linear statistic on the transmission eigenvalues to eqs.([keyzero ] ) and ( [ e17 ] ) .",

    "for the reflectionless - tunneling phenomenon , the complete equivalence has been demonstrated to the non - equilibrium green s function approach .",
    "( the other effects we discussed have so far mainly been treated in the scattering approach . )",
    "although mathematically equivalent , the physical picture offered by the two approaches is quite different .",
    "we chose to focus on the scattering approach because it makes direct contact with the quantum interference effects studied extensively in the normal state .",
    "the same techniques used for weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations in normal conductors could be used to study the modifications by andreev reflection in an ns junction .    in the limit of zero voltage , zero temperature , and zero magnetic field ,",
    "the transport properties of the ns junction are determined entirely by the transmission eigenvalues @xmath20 of the normal region . a scaling theory for the distribution of the @xmath20 s",
    "then allows one to obtain analytical results for the mean and variance of any observable of the form @xmath210 .",
    "the conductance is of this form , as well as the shot - noise power .",
    "the only difference with the normal state is the functional form of @xmath463 ( polynomial in the normal state , rational function for an ns junction ) , so that the general results of the scaling theory [ valid for any function @xmath463 ] can be applied at once . at finite @xmath12 , @xmath179 , or @xmath251",

    "<S> recent experiments on conduction between a semiconductor and a superconductor have revealed a variety of new mesoscopic phenomena . here is a review of the present status of this rapidly developing field . </S>",
    "<S> a scattering theory is described which leads to a conductance formula analogous to landauer s formula in normal - state conduction . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is used to identify features in the conductance which can serve as `` signatures '' of phase - coherent andreev reflection , i.e.  for which the phase coherence of the electrons and the andreev - reflected holes is essential . </S>",
    "<S> the applications of the theory include a quantum point contact ( conductance quantization in multiples of @xmath0 ) , a quantum dot ( non - lorentzian conductance resonance ) , and quantum interference effects in a disordered normal - superconductor junction ( enhanced weak - localization and reflectionless tunneling through a potential barrier ) . </S>",
    "<S> the final two sections deal with the effects of andreev reflection on universal conductance fluctuations and on the shot noise . </S>",
