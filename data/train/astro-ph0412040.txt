    "this paper presents _ hst / wfpc2 _ observations of 77 early - type galaxies .",
    "we investigate the central morphology of the galaxies by characterizing the properties of their nuclei , color gradients , ellipticities , isophote twists , instances of central surface brightness minima , offset centers , dust content , and dust morphologies .",
    "the result is a more complete portrait of the sample galaxies than has been available heretofore and a reference where many different properties are measured and compared in one place .",
    "we also derive high resolution surface photometry profiles of the sample galaxies , which we characterize with `` nuker law '' fits @xcite .",
    "analysis of the fit parameters is presented in paper vi ( lauer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , in which we combine the present results with previously published nuker law fits to _ hst _ surface photometry profiles to define an extended sample of 264 e / s0 galaxies .",
    "a motivation of both this paper and paper vi is to understand the origin of `` cores '' in early - type galaxies .",
    "_ hst _ images show that nearly all galaxies have singular starlight distributions in the sense that surface brightness diverges as @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite . in typically",
    "lower - luminosity early - type galaxies , @xmath6 decreases only slowly as the center is approached and a steep @xmath7 cusp continues into the _ hst _",
    "resolution limit ; @xcite classified these systems as `` power - law '' galaxies . in more luminous galaxies , however , the projected profile transitions or breaks from a steep power law in the envelope to a shallow inner cusp with @xmath8 ; these `` core galaxies '' thus show central deficits of starlight or a core compared to the centrally - steeper `` power - law '' galaxies .",
    "many of the core galaxies are the same systems in which cores were already evident from ground - based observations @xcite ; however , rather than representing regions in which the central stellar density becomes constant , the residual shallow cusps in projected brightness still imply steep and singular cusps in density @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the distribution of cusp slopes at the _ hst _ resolution limit in both stellar luminosity density and projected surface brightness is bimodal ; power - laws and core galaxies are separated into two distinct groups by their inner cusp slopes . @xcite and @xcite later identified a small number of `` intermediate '' galaxies that have limiting cusp slopes with @xmath9 but showed that the ensemble of cusp slopes in all early - type galaxies is still bimodal .",
    "this topic will be further explored in paper vi , which strongly ratifies the bimodality of central structure .",
    "@xcite also examined how the central structure correlates with other galaxy properties , showing that luminous early - type galaxies preferentially have cores , whereas most fainter spheroids have power - law profiles .",
    "moreover , cores are slowly rotating and have boxy isophotes , while power laws rotate rapidly and are disky .",
    "these ideas resonate well with a revision of the hubble sequence proposed by @xcite , which divided ellipticals into boxy , non - rotating types and disky , rotating types .",
    "the latter were seen to be the close relatives of spirals , whereas the boxy , non - rotating ellipticals were somehow  different . \"",
    "cores are associated with the boxy , non - rotating sequence , and thus serve as a fundamental morphological marker .",
    "@xcite further argued that the prevalence of cores is directly tied to the presence of nuclear black holes in nearly all galaxies @xcite and the assembly of galaxies by hierarchical mergers .",
    "@xcite argued that the merging of two galaxies , each harboring a central massive black hole , would create a black hole binary in the center of the merger remnant .",
    "gradual hardening of the binary via stellar encounters would scatter stars out of the center , creating a central deficit of stars with respect to inward extrapolation of the envelope in a merged galaxy whose center would otherwise be very dense .",
    "n - body simulations of merging galaxies with central black holes @xcite show that cores can indeed form in such merger remnants . looking for ways to test",
    "the hypothesis that cores reflect the effects of binary black holes on the central structure of galaxies is a subtext for much of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "we will return to this topic in the summary .",
    "a final section of the paper is devoted to the morphology and prevalence of optical dust absorption in early - type galaxies . as in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , dust",
    "is found in roughly half of our galaxies .",
    "dust is extremely well correlated with both the presence and strength of nuclear optical emission , which we assume indicates agn activity .",
    "thus , it is hard to avoid concluding that dust is outlining interstellar material that is about to fall onto the black hole , and that it therefore becomes a valuable clue as to how that happens .",
    "we discuss the possibility that the diverse patterns of dust absorption seen in early - type galaxies may be viewed as various stages of a `` settling sequence ; '' under this picture dust may come and go on timescales of a few @xmath10 years .",
    "the implication is that galaxies might be emptying and refilling themselves with dust constantly , raising the question of where the dust comes from and why the process is cyclical .",
    "understanding this could be an important clue to the growth of black holes .",
    "we present images and surface photometry for 77 early - type galaxies observed with _",
    "hst_+ wfpc2 ; 55 of these were obtained under programs go 5512 , 6099 , 6587 , and 9107 which were carried out by our collaboration .",
    "the observations are listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we also include an independent reduction of the galaxies observed in go 5454 ( pi : franx ) , which were selected to have kinematically decoupled cores ( kdc ) .",
    "analysis of these by @xcite showed no morphological differences between ordinary ellipticals and those with kdc , thus including these galaxies in the present sample causes no obvious bias .",
    "some of the remaining galaxies represent original or archival images obtained in support of go 9107 , in which we proposed stis spectroscopy to explore the mass range of nuclear black holes at a particular galaxy luminosity .",
    "lastly , there are additional galaxies obtained from the archive in support of our other stis programs .",
    "a portion of this photometry has been published previously in papers on the detection of nuclear black holes @xcite or on the morphology of galaxies with double centers or local minima in surface brightness at their centers @xcite ; such galaxies are presented again here to provide complete surface photometry in the context of a comprehensive re - investigation of the central structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] lists any earlier publication of surface photometry derived from the given dataset .",
    "there is no single criterion that characterizes our sample . in general",
    ", the sample comprises relatively luminous nearby elliptical and early - s0 galaxies that could be investigated spectroscopically with _",
    "hst _ to detect and  weigh \" nuclear black holes .",
    "the particular selection of galaxies was heavily informed by the central - structure parameter relationships presented by @xcite .",
    "several galaxies were selected , for example , within the luminosity range over which power - law and core galaxies co - exist , to explore the transition between the two types .",
    "others were selected to extend the luminosity range of the core parameter relationships .",
    "the properties of the galaxies , such as luminosity , velocity dispersion , distance , and morphology are listed in table [ tab : glob ] .",
    "a set of galaxies already observed with wfpc1 and presented by @xcite were also re - observed with wfpc2 when it was felt that the improved resolution and dynamic range might lead to a significant improvement in the galaxies central structure . in the end ,",
    "the sample is rich in core galaxies , with relatively few power - law galaxies ; it thus is complementary to the @xcite sample , which is rich in power - law galaxies .",
    "all galaxies were imaged with the high - resolution pc1 ccd in wfpc2 ; the image scale is @xmath11pixel .",
    "nearly all galaxies were imaged in the f555w filter ( equivalent to broad band @xmath12 ) ; images were also obtained in f814w filter ( broad band @xmath13 ) to provide color information for many galaxies .",
    "the exposure time for most galaxies was roughly a single orbit in each filter , typically split into several sub - exposures to allow for cosmic - ray event repair .",
    "the exposure levels in the galaxy centers varied widely over the sample , but were typically @xmath14 which is optimal for point - spread function ( psf ) deconvolution .",
    "beginning in program g0 6587 , many of the image sets were dithered in a @xmath15 square pattern of 0.5 pc pixel substeps .",
    "this procedure allows for the removal of the aliasing present in any single pc image and consequent recovery of the optimal spatial resolution provided by the _",
    "hst_+wfpc2 combination .",
    "the reduction procedure for a given image set depended on whether the images were dithered .",
    "non - dithered image sets were always obtained with the same pointing and could simply be compared to detect and repair cosmic - ray events , before being stacked .",
    "the dithered images for a given galaxy and filter combination were combined into a single nyquist - sampled `` super - image '' using the fourier algorithm presented by @xcite .",
    "the algorithm combines the images in the fourier domain and is designed to recover the nyquist image even if the dither positions are somewhat non - optimal .",
    "the output of the algorithm is a double - sampled image with 0.5 pc pixel steps .",
    "the fourier algorithm is theoretically justified and introduces no blurring of the data ; this is in contrast to _ drizzle _",
    "@xcite , which can not remove aliasing in a small dataset , and introduces additional blurring on the scale of the original pixel sampling .",
    "a drawback of our reduction path is that the pointing of each image in the image - set is slightly different , complicating the repair of cosmic - ray events .",
    "the procedure used for cosmic ray repair was to first intercompare the images ignoring their small offsets and then construct a nyquist image from the repaired images .",
    "this first estimate of the nyquist image was used to improve the initial detection of the cosmic - ray events , thus producing a revised nyquist image .",
    "this procedure was iterated a second time to produce the final image .",
    "the final step was to deconvolve the psf .",
    "hst+_wfpc2 psf introduces significant blurring as far as @xmath16 from the galaxy centers , but deconvolution can recover the intrinsic surface brightness profiles to a few percent accuracy for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "deconvolution was achieved by 40 iterations of the lucy - richardson @xcite algorithm .",
    "the psfs were calculated from the tiny - tim package @xcite .",
    "for the double - sampled images , the tiny - tim psfs were convolved with the pixel - response function of @xcite .",
    "central images of the sample galaxies are shown in figures [ fig : images ] and [ fig : obs_im ] .",
    "while the classic view of early - type galaxies is that they are purely stellar systems with elliptical isophotes , the majority of the galaxies depart from this picture one way or another , having central dust patches or rings , stellar disks , nuclear clusters , central minima , and so on .",
    "a summary of the morphological features seen is presented in table [ tab : morph ] .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] also shows the galaxy images divided by models reconstructed from the surface photometry ( described below ) to help isolate these features .",
    "those galaxies that had their centers so obscured by dust that surface photometry could not be derived are shown separately in figure [ fig : obs_im ] . the overall importance of dust for any galaxy",
    "was roughly quantified by comparing the integrated light of the observations to model galaxy images reconstructed from the surface photometry within @xmath18 of the galaxy centers .",
    "the dust absorption thus estimated is presented in table [ tab : morph ] in units of hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "these absorption values are not intended for quantitative astrophysical interpretation , but do seem to correspond well to subjective impressions of the strength of central dust seen in figure [ fig : images ] .",
    "surface photometry was derived under the assumption that the isophotes are concentric ellipses , but with position angle and ellipticity than can vary arbitrarily with radius .",
    "the photometry was measured in several stages .",
    "the first step was to mask obvious stars , dust patches , image defects , and so on , from the images .",
    "initial photometry was derived using the least - squares algorithm of @xcite . a model reconstructed from photometry",
    "was then subtracted from the images to isolate and mask more subtle features that were missed during the initial pass . for galaxies with extensive dust",
    "this procedure was often iterated several times , as the isophote parameters would often change significantly as the mask was refined .",
    "the final stage was to measure the inner isophotes ( @xmath19 ) with the high - resolution algorithm of @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses sinc - interpolation to sample the image , thus preserving the spatial resolution of the images . for this stage ,",
    "image defects were initially filled in with a model constructed from the lower - resolution photometry , and then with a model constructed from the high - resolution photometry .",
    "the final surface photometry profiles are presented in figure [ fig : surf ] .",
    "the zeropoint calibration was obtained from @xcite .",
    "a `` sky '' level for each galaxy was measured from the corner of the wfpc2 wf3 ccd farthest away from the galaxy center ( typically @xmath20 in angle ) , and was subtracted from the photometry . for the more extended galaxies ,",
    "the sky will have some galaxy - light contamination , but given that the present study focuses on the brighter central isophotes , this will cause only a small error .",
    "a number of galaxies in the sample were originally observed with wfpc1 .",
    "the new wfpc2 photometry allows a test of the wfpc1 observations , which required large deconvolution corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : decon ] compares wfpc2 and wfpc1 profiles for several galaxies .",
    "@xcite argued based on simulations that deconvolution could recover profiles from wfpc1 that were accurate to a few percent for @xmath21 with significant residual blurring at smaller radii .",
    "the comparison of wfpc2 and wfpc1 photometry for m32 and m33 presented by @xcite showed this conclusion to be essentially correct , while underscoring the need to deconvolve wfpc2 photometry as well .",
    "figure [ fig : decon ] ratifies this conclusion for a larger set of galaxies . for the most part , the wfpc2 and wfpc1 profiles agree extremely well for @xmath22 the exception to this general rule appears to be galaxies with strong nuclei , such as ngc 3115 , where light from the central point - source spilled beyond @xmath23 and was poorly recovered by wfpc1 .",
    "weak nuclei in core galaxies , such as in ngc 1399 , were also poorly captured by wfpc1 .",
    "the conclusion , overall , is that the wfpc1 profiles can still be used to their stated @xmath24 resolution limit .",
    "we fitted the surface brightness profiles with the `` nuker law '' @xcite parametric form @xmath25^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha } , \\label{eqn : nuker}\\ ] ] which describes the profiles as a `` broken power law ; '' it is an extension of a broken power - law form first used to describe the brightness profile of m32 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is the semi - major axis represented the geometric mean of the semi - major and semi - minor axes . ] .",
    "the outer portion of the profile is a steep power - law with logarithmic slope , @xmath27 this outer power - law `` breaks '' at radius @xmath28 transitioning to a shallower inner power - law with slope @xmath29 the smoothness or  speed \" of transition is determined by @xmath30 the intensity scale is set by @xmath31 the surface brightness at @xmath32 the break radius is both the point of maximum curvature of the profile in logarithmic coordinates and the location where the local slope is the average , @xmath33 of the inner and outer slopes . in passing ,",
    "we note that we are aware of the limitations of parametric fits to data .",
    "however , a nonparametric analysis of the wfpc1 profiles by @xcite yielded no additional insight into the central structure of elliptical galaxies than was provided by the parametric analysis of @xcite and @xcite using the nuker law .    we fitted the major - axis profiles using the minuit package @xcite , which was also used by @xcite to fit the wfpc1 profiles . unlike byun et al .",
    ", however , we allowed the algorithm to find solutions with @xmath34 the discovery of galaxies with central _ minima _ in surface brightness @xcite shows that central brightness profiles with positive slopes must be allowed for .",
    "while in formally @xmath35 would imply that the surface brightness profile goes to zero as @xmath36 which is impossible in projection , the integrated brightness in any aperture remains positive , and more to the point , we mean to imply no behavior of the profile within the resolution limit .",
    "the nuker law parameters for all galaxies in figure [ fig : images ] are listed in table [ tab : cen ] and plotted in figure [ fig : surf ] .",
    "the radial domain fitted was adjusted on an _ ad hoc _ basis based on the structure of a given galaxy and the residuals of an initial nuker law fit over the entire extent of the profile .",
    "typically an inner limit was specified to avoid nuclei ( see below ) , which the nuker law is not intended to represent .",
    "an outer limit was specified in some cases to avoid deviations from the nuker law that might have influenced the quality of the fit to the inner region .",
    "the fits are shown as solid lines in figure [ fig : surf ] , with the extent of the line showing the radial range of the fit .",
    "the fit residuals are plotted at the bottom of the brightness profile panels .",
    "@xcite showed that the brightness profiles could be grouped into two classes . ``",
    "core galaxies '' show an obvious break in logarithmic slope that marks a transition to a shallow inner cusp with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the slope at the _ hst _ resolution limit ( @xmath39 for the f555w wfpc2 images ) .",
    "`` power - law galaxies , '' in contrast , retain a steep slope , @xmath40 into the resolution limit . as was shown by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of cusp slopes is bimodal , with no examples of galaxies in those papers with @xmath41 this classification scheme will be re - examined in detail in paper vi .",
    "the adopted profile classifications are listed in table [ tab : cen ] . in some cases ,",
    "as noted in table [ tab : cen ] , we have reclassified a number of galaxies previously observed by ourselves or others because we have adopted finer resolution limits or used higher resolution imagery than the previous investigations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite identified a set of galaxies that have @xmath42 which rest et al .",
    "call `` intermediate '' galaxies .",
    "three such galaxies ( ngc 821 , 3585 , and 7723 ) are in the present sample . as @xcite showed , intermediate types are rare , so that the distribution of cusp slopes remains bimodal , even if the region between core and power - law galaxies is no longer completely empty .",
    "we also validate the concern of @xcite that the intermediate classification is highly sensitive to resolution . as it happens , after adopting finer resolution limits than did rest et al .",
    ", we consider _ all _ of their intermediate galaxies to be core galaxies , while we now consider some of their power - law galaxies to be intermediates .",
    "we will explore this issue in detail in paper vi .",
    "figure [ fig : ellip ] plots the average isophote ellipticity interior to @xmath28 weighted by the integrated isophote luminosity ( analogous to equation ( [ eqn : lw ] ) in @xmath43 below ) , as a function of the average exterior ellipticity ( averaged the same way but for @xmath44 ) for both core and power - law galaxies ( ellipticity values are given in table [ tab : ellip ] ) .",
    "there is no clear trend for either type of galaxy to become systematically flatter or rounder as the center is approached .",
    "what is evident in figure [ fig : ellip ] , however , is that the power - law galaxies on average are more elliptical than core galaxies .",
    "this trend is also seen in figure [ fig : ellip_mag ] , which plots inner ellipticity as a function of galaxy luminosity . while @xcite show that elliptical galaxies overall become rounder with increasing luminosity , and cores become more prevalent with luminosity , core galaxies are rounder than power - law galaxies at the same luminosity .",
    "@xcite looked at _ hst _ photometry of a large sample of elliptical galaxies and reached similar conclusions .",
    "in particular , they looked at isophote shape as a function of the fractional distance to the effective radius , finding that the distinction between core and power - law galaxies was strongest at the smallest radii .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that the power - law galaxies ( their type ii ) in their sample were highly elliptical , while the core galaxies ( their type i ) were nearly round .",
    "they argued that the difference between the two was _ merely one of projection . _ in their view , all ellipticals harbored disks , which when seen edge - on would make sharply rising cusps ; the stellar density profiles of all ellipticals would have essentially the same form . @xcite",
    "disagreed with this picture , noting the existence of round power - law galaxies , which should not exist at all in the projection model . moreover , the new data in figures [ fig : ellip ] and [ fig : ellip_mag ] show that core galaxies co - exist with power - law galaxies at all ellipticities .",
    "although core galaxies are on average rounder than power - law galaxies , the ellipticity distributions of the two types overlap significantly , whereas the projection model implies a much cleaner separation .",
    "@xcite also claimed that the majority of highly elliptical power - law galaxies showed no evidence of a central stellar disk ; however , we now think that such cases are rare .",
    "first @xcite subsequently noted that power - law galaxies have disky _ outer _ isophotes , which firmly associates power - laws with disks .",
    "now , new wfpc2 imagery here shows that disks can be seen in _",
    "nearly all _ power - law galaxies with inner ellipticity @xmath45 whereas _ no _ disks are seen in power - law galaxies rounder than that ( see figure [ fig : ellip_mag ] ) .",
    "this strong dichotomy suggests that _ all _ power - law galaxies harbor disks ; their visibility is simply due to the viewing angle .",
    "it is true that @xcite found disks in only three out of nine highly elliptical power - law galaxies ; however , some of the disks in the present sample are faint and may have been poorly visible in wfpc1 imagery .",
    "while , in common with @xcite , we can not detect a disk in the power - law galaxy ngc 1426 ( which has @xmath46 ) , we do find a disk in ngc 4458 ( and now classify it as a core rather than power - law galaxy ) .",
    "core galaxies generally have boxy isophotes @xcite , but we find disks in four core galaxies , all of which have high inner @xmath47 three of these are rather dim , having @xmath48 and only one ( ngc 3706 ) of the five highly elliptical core galaxies brighter than this has a disk .",
    "two of the three intermediate galaxies also have disks , and they also lie in the same magnitude transition zone near @xmath49    the overall impression is that disks are frequent if not ubiquitous in power - law galaxies , populate a fair fraction of faint cores and intermediate galaxies in the transition zone , and then peter out amongst bright core galaxies . the disappearance of disks with brightness seems to be related to the core / power - law transition itself and may give a clue as to how it occurs , as discussed in the summary .",
    "an examination of the isophote position angle profiles presented in figure [ fig : surf ] shows that many core galaxies have significant isophote twists close to or interior to their break radii .",
    "this behavior , for example , can be seen in ngc 507 , the first galaxy presented in figure [ fig : surf ] .",
    "the general phenomenon is that most core galaxies have isophote orientations that remain essentially constant over their outer radii ( within the regions imaged by wfpc2 ) , but at some small radius the isophotes smoothly twist away from the outer orientations .    to quantify this phenomenon , we fitted the position angle profiles of the core galaxies with a `` hinged '' line .",
    "in detail , a line was first fitted over the outer portion of the profile , starting at an inner limiting `` hinge '' radius .",
    "once the parameters of the outer line were determined , a second line was fitted interior to the hinge radius ( but still with @xmath50 to avoid nuclei ) with the constraint that the inner line had to intersect with the outer line at the hinge radius .",
    "the effect is to fit the entire position angle profile with two lines of differing slope that intersect at a `` hinge . ''",
    "the position of the hinge was selected by finding the location that minimized the residuals of the entire position angle profile fitted by both line segments .",
    "the final fits are shown as dotted lines in the position angle plots in figure [ fig : surf ] .",
    "table [ tab : bend ] presents the values of the inner and outer position angle gradients , the hinge radius , and the local logarithmic slope of the brightness profile , @xmath51 at that location .",
    "figure [ fig : bend ] shows the inner position angle gradients as a function of @xmath38 at the transition radius .",
    "the symbols plotted also show the inner and outer gradients schematically as angled wedges , with the slopes of the segments to the left and right of the vertex proportional to the inner and outer position - angle gradients .",
    "both the table and figure show that the isophote position angle varies only slowly outside the hinge radius , but strong twists occur at small radii .",
    "the transition in behavior occurs near @xmath52 a point typically within the shallow surface brightness cusp interior to the core break - radius .",
    "figure [ fig : bend_pow ] plots the same data for the power - law galaxies .",
    "the power - law galaxies appear to have at most very small twists in their inner isophotes .",
    "only two galaxies not affected by dust have gradients that exceed @xmath53 consideration of the true `` power '' in the twists in power law galaxies , however , suggests that they are as significant as the large twists seen in the inner cusps of the core galaxies .",
    "the significance of any given isophote twist is tied to how much the light distribution in a galaxy must have changed to exhibit the twist .",
    "very little light needs to be redistributed in a portion of a galaxy with a shallow brightness gradient and nearly circular isophotes to cause a strong twist in angle , while the perturbation must be large when the gradient is steep or the isophotes are highly elliptical .",
    "we have attempted to quantify these effects by following the general approach of @xcite , who analyzed the shapes of dwarf ellipticals by introducing a twist - measure that accounts for the true perturbation in the projected light distribution of a galaxy to produce the observed twists .",
    "the basic concept is to measure the relative amount of light required to `` iron - out '' or untwist a twisted galaxy .",
    "the first step is to use the brightness profiles to calculate the luminosity - weighted average position angle of a given galaxy , @xmath54 over a major - axis range @xmath55 in which the twist is to be measured . here",
    "@xmath56 gives the isophote position angle profile , @xmath57 is the brightness profile , @xmath58 is the integrated galaxy luminosity over the radial range , and the area element is @xmath59 where @xmath60 the ratio of isophote minor to major axes at @xmath61 the `` surface - brightness twist '' is estimated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an image reconstructed from the surface photometry with the isophotes all forced to have position angle @xmath64 while @xmath65 is an image reconstructed from the surface photometry with the twists as measured , and the sum is over the @xmath66 pixels within @xmath67 the surface - brightness twist thus is a typical relative root - mean - square ( rms ) measure of the difference between the untwisted and observed galaxy .",
    "we emphasize that our @xmath68 measure differs from that of @xcite , which we believe suffers from a conceptual error in its derivation .",
    "we have calculated surface - brightness twists separately for the radius ranges inside and outside the hinge radius ( limited to an outer radius three times larger than the hinge - radius defining the boundary of the inner and outer gradients ) ; they are presented in table [ tab : bend ] and figure [ fig : twist ] .",
    "as can be seen , both power - law and core galaxies exhibit somewhat stronger twists in their inner regions .",
    "the inner - twists are typically @xmath69 stronger for both types of galaxies than the outer twists .",
    "displayed this way , however , we see that the significance of the inner twists in both core and power - law galaxies is essentially the same .      the @xmath70 color gradients of the inner regions of the sample galaxies are generically similar to those seen farther out in the envelopes of early - type galaxies .",
    "the great majority of sample galaxies become slightly redder toward the center .",
    "the exceptions are ngc 2300 , 4382 , and 7457 , which have shallow gradients that become _ bluer _ with decreasing radius . as seen in figure [ fig : surf ] , the color gradients are roughly linear with shallow slopes in logarithmic coordinates .",
    "table [ tab : vmi ] lists the color gradients measured over @xmath71 the inner cutoff is set to avoid nuclear sources .",
    "figure 4 of @xcite suggests that the color gradients show more variability over @xmath72 than they do at larger radii , but we do not see this effect .",
    "the strengths of the color gradients superficially appear to depend on the profile type of the galaxy , as already suggested by figure 11 of @xcite , and by high - resolution ground - based images of galaxy centers @xcite ; however , this effect appears largely to be due to the greater prevalence of dust in power - law galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : grad_gam ] plots the color gradients as a function of the limiting logarithmic profile slope at the resolution limit , @xmath73 the symbol type encodes the central dust indices given in table [ tab : morph ] , with open symbols corresponding to galaxies with dust absorption greater that 0.02 mag .",
    "even though we attempted to exclude visible dust patches from the profile estimation algorithms , the strongest color gradients correlate with the largest scatter about the mean gradient line , supporting the conclusion that the color profiles in these cases are still affected by residual dust absorption and are not likely to reflect true changes in the underlying stellar population .",
    "if dusty galaxies are ignored , there still a suggestion of a weak trend for power - law galaxies to have stronger gradients than core galaxies ; the mean @xmath70 gradients for the two types are @xmath74 mag ( excluding the one power - law galaxy with a positive gradient ) and @xmath75 mag , respectively . clearly , however , the scatter in color gradients at any @xmath38 is substantially larger than the small offset between the two types , and to first order both types of galaxies have essentially the same inner color gradients .",
    "lastly , figure [ fig : grad_mag ] shows that there is no relationship between the strength of the gradient and galaxy luminosity , once dusty galaxies are excluded .",
    "we also examined the color gradients of core galaxies to see if the gradients were smaller interior to the break radius .",
    "because the envelope color gradients in core galaxies are small to begin with , such a change in absolute terms will be a small effect , and indeed for the majority of core galaxies it is difficult to see any change in the gradient associated with the core . however , ngc 3379 , 3608 , 4291 , 4365 , 4406 , and 7619 do appear to have flatter color gradients for @xmath76 ngc 4406 provides the best example , but the significance of this effect is low .",
    "a substantial fraction of the sample galaxies have nuclei , a compact light source that is seen to rise above the inward extrapolated surface brightness cusp at small radii . in the present sample",

    "the inner radial limits of the fits were often increased to better isolate nuclei included in the initial fits .",
    "table [ tab : nuclei ] lists the luminosities and colors of the nuclei identified .",

    "the color of the nucleus is that of the central light source isolated from the hosting galaxy ; it is estimated from the nuker law residuals in the @xmath12 band and the @xmath70 profiles on the assumption that the @xmath70 color just outside the nuclei gives the color of the background starlight .",
    "the colors have been corrected for galactic reddening .",

    "most nuclei are also spatially unresolved ( more compact than @xmath78 pc ) ; only the nuclei in ngc 741 and 4365 appear to be resolved with scales of @xmath79 pc and @xmath80 pc , respectively .",

    "a basic structural paradigm that underlies the present structural analysis of early type galaxies is that their central starlight distributions can be described by concentric elliptical isophotes with surface brightness increasing monotonically towards the center .",
    "there is however , an increasingly large set of objects that depart from this picture .",
    "m31 @xcite and ngc4486b @xcite have double nuclei , and @xcite identify a number of galaxies that have local _ minima _ in their brightness profiles at or near their centers . in this section",
    "we discuss ngc 4073 and 4382 , which also have central surface brightness minima . in the next section",
    "we discuss an additional set of galaxies in which the location of maximum brightness within the core is spatially offset from the photocenter of the core itself .",
    "we speculate that a substantial majority if not all of these systems may be cases where black holes were critical to either creating or preserving the unusual structures over long times .",
    "@xcite , for example , explains the double nuclei in m31 ( and by implication , ngc 4486b ) as the projected appearance of an eccentric disk of starlight stabilized by a central black hole . in the case of the galaxies with central minima , @xcite advanced two competing explanations for the creation of such systems , both involving black holes .",
    "the first is that a diffuse torus of starlight has been added to a pre - existing core to create the appearance of a central minimum interior to the torus .",
    "this would occur during the final stages of merging in which the tidal field of the black hole in the more massive galaxy disrupts the dense center of a galaxy being cannibalized @xcite . a second",
    ", more exotic idea is that stars have actually been ejected from the galaxy center by the decay of a central black hole binary created in a merger .",
    "@xcite further noted that at least some of galaxies with central minima may be related to the double nucleus systems . strictly speaking , m31 and ngc 4486b have locations near their centers at which a local minimum in surface brightness occurs , and",
    "could thus be included in the class of galaxies with central minima .",
    "conversely , the local minima in some of the @xcite galaxies are bracketed by structures that create the appearance of highly diffuse double nuclei .",
    "separately , the central minimum in ngc 3706 is clearly due to a well defined central ring of stars that might create a double nucleus if it were slightly more eccentric or were viewed from a different angle ; the central structure in ngc 3706 resembles that of m31 in other ways . in the present sample , the center of ngc 4073 resembles that of @xcite galaxies ngc 4406 and 6876 , while ngc 4382 is yet another galaxy with a central minimum that resembles m31 .",
    "lastly , we note that the galaxies with offset centers , which we discuss in @xmath82 may be poorly resolved examples of double nuclei or galaxies with central minima .",
    "the core galaxy ngc 4073 is the brightest galaxy in the poor cluster mkw4 ; it is likely to have cannibalized other cluster members .",
    "@xcite obtained a rotation curve and stellar velocity dispersion profile .",
    "the central few arcseconds of the kinematic profiles reveal a @xmath83 depression in velocity dispersion and counter - rotation .",
    "@xcite thus argue that ngc 4073 has a kinematically - decoupled core .",
    "the envelope of ngc 4073 has a fairly high ellipticity of 0.4 ; however , for @xmath84 the isophotes rapidly become nearly circular and show a strong twist of over @xmath85 as is evident in the profiles shown in figure [ fig : surf ] , and in a contour plot of the galaxy center ( figure [ fig : n4073_con ] ) .",
    "the maximum surface brightness is reached in a `` ring '' at @xmath86 with the brightness falling by 0.14 mag at the center of the galaxy . at larger radii the surface brightness profile ( figure [ fig : surf ] ) first _ increases _ in slope with decreasing radius for @xmath87 before abruptly flattening off just outside the ring .",
    "superficially , a high contrast image of the galaxy center ( figure [ fig : n4073_im ] , left ) suggests that the center is obscured by a dust patch ; however , an archival nicmos-2 image ( figure [ fig : n4073_im ] , right ) ( gto 7820 ) in the @xmath88 band also shows a central minimum , despite its lower angular resolution .",
    "we conclude that we are seeing the intrinsic distribution of starlight rather than obscuration .",
    "a close examination of the image and contour plot shows that the central ring is not exactly symmetric , but is slightly brighter to one side .",
    "a cut through the center at position angle @xmath89 shows this clearly ( figure [ fig : n4073_cut ] ) by going through the brightest part of the ring .",
    "the maximum brightness along the cut occurs at @xmath90 from the central minimum , slightly further away from the center than the diametrically - opposed maximum , which occurs at @xmath91 from the central minimum .",
    "the implied eccentricity of the ring is @xmath92 the slightly asymmetric brightness distribution could be explained by an eccentric torus of stars @xcite .",
    "however , the ring - radius corresponds to @xmath93 pc , a considerably larger scale than that of the central minima discussed in @xcite , and one that is outside the nominal @xmath94 pc sphere - of - influence of a central black hole based on the velocity dispersion of ngc 4073 ( table [ tab : glob ] ) and the @xcite @xmath95 relationship .",
    "if so , the stability of such a torus might therefore be in question .      the central structure of ngc 4382",
    ", a bright s0 core galaxy in the virgo cluster , somewhat resembles the double nucleus of m31 ; here the central minimum is a `` valley '' between two brightness peaks .",
    "this might result from the projected appearance of a much more eccentric torus or stellar disk than that seen in ngc 4073 . as can be seen in figures [ fig : n4382_im ] and [ fig : n4382_con ] the isophotes become asymmetric for @xmath96 rounding out and becoming somewhat diffuse at position angle @xmath97 this side of the nucleus suggests a reduced - amplitude version of the off - center p1 component of m31 ; indeed , a local surface brightness peak occurs at @xmath98 separated by @xmath99 from the brightest portion of the nucleus , which itself is within @xmath100 of the galaxy envelope photocenter . based on the velocity dispersion of ngc 4382 ( table [ tab : glob ] ) and the @xcite @xmath95 relationship , the estimated sphere - of - influence of a central black hole is @xmath101 again like m31 ,",
    "the isophotes become more eccentric and twist @xmath102 within @xmath103 as the nucleus is approached ( figure [ fig : surf ] ) . the position angle of the line connecting the two brightness peaks",
    "is itself twisted away from isophotes of semimajor axes of only @xmath104 the isophotes on the side of the photocenter opposite the secondary peak become highly eccentric , appearing as an almost linear extension of the central nucleus ; this in turn resembles the p2 component of m31 .",
    "similar structure is seen in both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands ; a color - ratio image ( figure [ fig : n4382_im ] ) is flat ( except for a slight radial gradient ) , showing no evidence for dust or change in stellar population associated with the unusual nuclear structure .    from other data ,",
    "ngc 4382 appears to be an excellent candidate for a fairly recent merger ; the central structure noted here may be related to the unusual spectral properties of the central regions detected from ground - based observations .",
    "ngc 4382 has the second - highest fine - structure measure in the @xcite sample , who argue that the fine - structure measure is indicative of the time and strength of the last merger .",
    "@xcite obtained long - slit line - strength measures over the central region of ngc 4382 , finding it to have an exceptionally large @xmath105 absorption line - width of 2.6 ; they argued that the central population of ngc 4382 is as young as 3 gyr .",
    "they also confirm that the galaxy becomes steadily _ bluer _ with decreasing radius for @xmath106 as was first noted by @xcite .",
    "the present @xmath70 color profile of ngc 4382 also shows a centrally blue gradient for @xmath107 as discussed in @xmath108 nearly all galaxies have @xmath70 color gradients that become redder at small radii .",
    "we also note that ngc 4382 has an average @xmath70 color that is bluer than all but one galaxy in the present sample ( table [ tab : vmi ] ) .",
    "we do , however , disagree with some of the finer details of the ngc 4382 color distribution presented by @xcite  we find that the nucleus is essentially the same color as the surrounding galaxy for @xmath109 and we do not find any evidence for a central ring of particularly blue emission .",
    "@xcite notes that the stellar velocity dispersion profile of ngc 4382 decreases for @xmath84 which is confirmed in sauron observations @xcite .",
    "high spatial - resolution spectroscopy with the oasis instrument shows that the core within @xmath110 counter - rotates with respect to the outer envelope of the galaxy @xcite .      in our data ,",
    "the location of maximum surface brightness is typically concentric with the surrounding galaxy , as measured by the center of the isophotes on @xmath111 scales , with a median precision of @xmath112 75% of the sample has the peak brightness concentric to within @xmath113 in physical units , this means that the galaxy centers are aligned at the sub - parsec level with the isophotes on the scale of the break radii farther out .",
    "any lopsidedness or strong @xmath114 asymmetries on the scale of the galaxy cores is therefore extremely rare ( or of extremely low amplitude ) .",
    "however , we identify five galaxies ( table [ tab : morph ] ) in which the center of the surface brightness cusp appears to be significantly displaced from the surrounding galaxy .    in ngc 507",
    ", the brightness peak is displaced @xmath115 from the surrounding core ; this is readily apparent in a contour plot ( figure [ fig : n0507_con ] ) and in the residuals of the surface photometry model ( figure [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "examination of the image of ngc 1374 shows that its brightness peak is clearly offset from its core ( figure [ fig : n1374_con ] ) , but the measured offset is only @xmath116 the image of ngc 7619 looks normal , but the surface photometry model shows a clear pattern associated with an offset peak , which is found to be displaced from the core by @xmath117 ngc 4291 and 5576 show similar central offsets when the model is compared to the images .",
    "in contrast , @xcite identified ngc 1700 as a possible candidate for an offset center , but the improved imagery presented here shows no such effect .",
    "the five galaxies identified here with offset centers are all core galaxies , but the implied @xmath118 fraction of core galaxies with offset centers is too small to rule out similar behavior in the power - law galaxies , which are more poorly represented in the present sample .    it is now recognized that many early - type galaxies are triaxial , rather than axisymmetric . the term  triaxial \" is usually taken to mean that the galaxy is symmetric with respect to three orthogonal principal planes ( the @xmath119 point symmetry group ) ; if this symmetry is present then all isophotes should be concentric .",
    "however , there is no known dynamical argument that prohibits self - consistent stellar systems without this symmetry ( e.g. , lopsided systems ) .",
    "the observation that the centers of most early - type galaxies have concentric isophotes therefore shows that some aspect of the galaxy - formation process strongly favors systems with @xmath119 symmetry . in the rare exceptions such as m31 @xcite",
    ", the lopsidedness appears to be localized within the sphere of influence of the central black hole , which is natural since orbits do not precess in a kepler potential , so a lopsided orbit distribution is not axisymmetrized by phase mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the coincidence of the point of maximum surface brightness with the centroid of the isophotes on larger scales also suggests that any massive black hole is located at the bottom of the potential well due to the stellar mass distribution to within a fraction of a parsec .",
    "massive black holes are normally expected to be close to the potential minimum because they rapidly lose orbital energy due to dynamical friction ; however , the black hole will execute brownian motion relative to the potential minimum due to gravitational encounters with nearby stars .",
    "the expected rms amplitude @xmath120 and velocity @xmath121 of this motion have been discussed by many authors .",
    "@xcite argued that the black hole should be in energy equipartition with the unbound stars surrounding it ; for a hole of mass @xmath122 embedded in a homogeneous core with core radius @xmath123 we then expect that @xmath124 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the typical stellar mass and @xmath127 is the velocity dispersion in the core .",
    "@xcite obtained a similar result , which they confirmed using n - body simulations .",

    "black holes in a binary may also be displaced from the center .",
    "the expected binary semi - major axes are in the range 0.01  10 pc @xcite ; binaries at the larger end of this range may be within the resolution limit of _ hst .",
    "_    the conclusion that brownian wandering of a central black hole is not responsible for the offset centers leaves us with the hypothesis that these galaxies may be unresolved analogs to m31 ; this is suggested by the highly local nature of the offset centers plus the increasingly rich sample of early - type galaxies that have complex central structure .",
    "@xcite noted that the m31 nucleus was displaced from the m31 bulge based on ground - based observations , which had @xmath132 pc limiting resolution , prior to the _ hst _ discovery of the complex nuclear morphology @xcite .",
    "if m31 were at the distance of virgo , its double nucleus would remain unresolved by _ hst , _ and would look like an off - center galaxy .",
    "the estimated sizes of the black hole sphere - of - influence range from @xmath133 for ngc 5576 to @xmath134 for ngc 4291 , significantly larger than the observed central offsets for all five galaxies .",
    "the structure of these galaxies is thus not inconsistent with the @xcite model for m31 .",
    "it is already well - established that dust features are common in _ hst _ images of the centers of early type galaxies @xcite . in our own sample , dust is visible in 38 out of 77 galaxies .",
    "this frequency of 49% agrees well with that of previous studies ( @xcite : 40% ; @xcite : 23% ; @xcite : 41% ; @xcite : 48% ; @xcite : 75% ; @xcite : 56% ; @xcite : 43% ( their unbiased sample ) ) . if we combine the samples of @xcite and @xcite with the present sample ( this combination largely encompasses all _ hst _ samples ) , we find the overall frequency of dust to be 47% in a total of 177 galaxies ( see table [ tab : dustfreq ] for details ) .",
    "the sample of @xcite avoided known dust , whereas one quarter of the @xcite sample was strongly biased toward it ; the present sample has no obvious biases for dust .",
    "the combined sample is large enough that the observed dust fraction should approach a representative value for bright ellipticals .",
    "dust is about equally prevalent in both power - law galaxies and cores ; this agrees with frequencies seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dust morphologies were determined by eye using the @xmath135 postage stamps shown in figure [ fig : images ] .",
    "we should clarify that by `` dust '' in this paper we always mean clumpy dust that is visible as dark patches in _ hst _ images . a diffuse ( and possibly more massive ) warm dust component",
    "may also be present , detected by iras ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but that is not the focus here .",
    "following @xcite , we distinguish nuclear rings and disks ( which we lump together as `` rings '' ) from all other structures ( termed `` non - rings '' ) .",
    "ring structures are presumably highly flattened , circular , and axi - symmetric @xcite , implying ages that are at least a few orbital times ( an orbital time at 100 pc is a few million years ) .",
    "the non - ring class is further sub - divided into `` spirals '' ( with sheared dust patterns ) , and `` chaotics '' ( random blobs ) .",
    "a handful of transitional cases lie between the rings and non - rings .",
    "this schema is motivated by the notion that we are seeing various stages of a  settling sequence \" ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this idea is discussed further below , but it rests heavily on the fact that non - ring dust _ must _ be in a dynamically short - lived configuration .",
    "the settling hypothesis says that it is falling into the center to form nuclear rings .",
    "the most striking result of the dust morphology census is that the ratio of rings to non - rings is only 0.6 , consistent across all three sub - samples .",
    "this small ratio surprised us ; if rings are the descendants of short - lived non - rings , we expected to find a much larger ratio of rings to non - rings .",
    "in fact , the opposite is true .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "we studied larger model - subtracted images covering most of the pc1 ccd to learn about the radial distribution of dust beyond @xmath136 which may be relevant to the settling model .",
    "dust concentration was graded qualitatively , with ` 0 ' meaning that the dust is highly _",
    "un_concentrated  dust is more prevalent beyond the @xmath135 postage stamp than in it , ` 1 ' means that dust is visible both inside and outside of the postage stamp , and ` 2 ' means that dust is seen only in the postage stamp itself . the three dust properties , strength ( as already quantified in @xmath137 ) , morphology , and radial concentration , are presented in table [ tab : morph ] .",
    "only one of our 38 dusty galaxies ( ngc 6876 ) has unconcentrated dust ( concentration class 0 ) .",
    "thus , when dust appears in the envelope of the galaxy , it essentially always in seen in the center , too .",
    "the converse is not true .",
    "indeed , it is striking that galaxies with nuclear rings are completely devoid of dust outside the ring : not one dust cloud is to be found in these objects beyond the ring itself !    overall , the radial pattern of dust suggests an _ episodic _ settling model in which dust appears at times throughout the galaxy and then falls to the center .",
    "galaxies with lots of dust would be near the beginning of the cycle , when dust is still widely distributed .",
    "nuclear rings would be the endpoint of an episode , by which time the rest of the galaxy would be dust free .",
    "the fact that galaxies with weaker dust also tend to be highly concentrated ( table [ tab : morph ] ) suggests that dust is being destroyed as it sinks to the center ; it falls in , leaving just a few weak shreds by the time it nears the nucleus .",
    "a possible mechanism for dust destruction is sputtering by hot x - ray gas .",
    "survival of some but not all dust would then require that the timescale for dust destruction by sputtering be comparable to the timescale for infall .",
    "this is consistent with the dust - radiative cooling model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "many papers have found positive correlations between dust and nuclear optical emission , extended optical emission , non - thermal radio activity , and far - ir dust emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we decided to explore the relationship between dust and _ central _ optical emission since that relation seemed particularly close @xcite .",
    "optical emission - line strengths were taken from the literature ( sources given in table [ tab : morph ] ) .",
    "the emission is ranked qualitatively into four grades in table [ tab : morph ] : 0 ( no emission ) , 1 ( weak emission ) , 2 ( strong emission ) , and 3 ( very strong emission ) .",
    "some papers measure extended emission , but most are based on spectroscopic data and thus measure only nuclear emission , which in our galaxies has line ratios characteristic of active nuclei ( seyferts and liners ) . since extended and nuclear emission correlate well @xcite , we assume that any optical emission , however weak , signifies _ nuclear activity .",
    "_    the presence of dust in the inner @xmath135 of our galaxies correlates remarkably well with the presence of emission : 96% of galaxies without emission lack dust , whereas 90% of galaxies with emission have at least some dust .",
    "furthermore , the _ amounts _ of dust and emission also go together : mean dust strength in weak emission galaxies is only 1.09 , versus 1.85 in strong - emission and very - strong - emission galaxies ( see table [ tab : dustvsemiss ] ) .",
    "@xcite also found a close connection between dust and emission , though not quite so tight as in our sample .",
    "notably , emission strength does not appear to depend on dust morphology ; as also found by @xcite ; rings and non - rings with the same dust strength have qualitatively similar emission strengths .",
    "this connection between dust and emission is important if it is assumed , as here , that optical emission always signifies gas falling onto a black hole .",
    "it then follows that visible dust actually _ shows _ us gas that is about to fall onto the hole .",
    "the distribution and motions of dust become essential clues to the feeding of local agns , a point that was also stressed by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dust_mag ] plots the histograms of dusty and clean galaxies in virgo as a function of absolute magnitude .",
    "dust is found in roughly half the galaxies brighter than @xmath138 ( which is the normal frequency ) , whereas _ all _ 16 dimmer galaxies in virgo are dust free .",
    "the probability of this happening by chance in 16 galaxies is only @xmath139 if the dividing line were placed at @xmath140 it would still be only @xmath141 .",
    "either dust is intrinsically rare in faint ellipticals , or the cluster environment discourages the accumulation of dust in small galaxies . deciding between these hypotheses is problematic since the only good selection of faint galaxies is in the virgo cluster .",
    "the episodic settling model implies that we should to be able to identify galaxies that are in different stages of settling .",
    "a possible sequence is offered in figure [ fig : sequence ] .",
    "the transitional objects that appear to be in the process of settling from a non - ring configuration into a ring are particularly important .",
    "four ( perhaps five ) of these are in our data , two of which are shown in figure [ fig : sequence ] .",
    "@xcite note similar transitional structures in radio galaxies , which they call  lanes . \"",
    "lanes are geometrically distinct from rings and are more skewed with respect to stellar principal planes , indicating transient configurations that they suggest are in the process of settling .",
    "if all these galaxies are really parts of a sequence  non - rings , rings , to empty  then setting the lifetime of any one phase sets the lifetime of the other two phases .",
    "a good place to start is the non - ring phase . since non - ring dust can not be in dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "a reasonable estimate of the lifetime is the local dynamical time .",
    "the orbital time at 1 kpc in a bright elliptical galaxy is @xmath142 yr , and at the edge of a 100 pc nuclear ring is ten times shorter .",
    "dust sputtering times ( even with self - shielding ) are also of order @xmath143 years @xcite , which is consistent with destruction of some fraction of the dust as it falls in .",
    "finally , once gas falls close to a rotating disk , the timescale to settle into a principal plane of the gravitational potential is again a few orbital times @xcite .",
    "the ratio of rings to non - rings can now be used to estimate the lifetime of the ring phase . since that ratio is less than unity ( 0.6 ) , the nuclear rings must be even shorter - lived ! @xcite model the kinematics of the nuclear ring in ngc 4261 , calling attention to the high turbulent velocity near the center .",
    "this central line - broadening is a common feature of nuclear rings ( e.g. , ngc 7052 , @xcite ) and may be ubiquitous .",
    "it implies high turbulent viscosity , say @xcite , which causes the inner gas to flow inward and feed the black hole .",
    "their estimated timescale for emptying out the inner ring is @xmath3 yr , not far from the timescale needed by the settling model .",
    "finally , rings should empty from the inside out .",
    "one might therefore expect a population of  ghost \" rings that are the remnants of previously filled disks ; four such candidates are in our sample , two of which are exceedingly faint ( ngc 741 , 2778 , 3379 , and 3608 ) .",
    "a further interesting observation is the finding by @xcite that dust grains are smaller in rings than in non - rings .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that the grains in rings were subjected to more sputtering by the hot gas , and are therefore older .",
    "the final step is to deduce the length of time that galaxies remain dust free , which sets the length of the whole cycle .",
    "since half of all bright ellipticals are dust free , the length of the dust - free phase must be of order that of the dusty phase , that is , a few times @xmath144 yr , and the length of the whole cycle is only @xmath145 yr .",
    "the assumption of a settling sequence thus implies that _ clumpy dust is appearing and disappearing continually in ellipticals .",
    "_ this would help to understand why there seems to be little correlation between the presence of dust and merger remnants @xcite ; merger phenomena are comparatively long - lived and would show little correlation with more rapid dust cycling .",
    "the same reason would explain why there is little correlation between mean light - weighted stellar population ages and the presence of dust ( d. forbes , private communication ) .",
    "the `` dust settling '' hypothesis leaves at least three major questions unanswered .",
    "the first is the origin of the dust , whether internal ( shed by stellar winds ) or external ( accreted from outside ) .",
    "we find it striking that there is not the slightest evidence , even in very dusty galaxies , for any extra starlight , either distributed in clumps throughout the galaxy or in the neighborhood of the dust clouds themselves .",
    "our subtracted models should be very sensitive to clumpy starlight , yet no trace of stars is seen .",
    "any dust accreted from the outside must therefore be essentially _ star free _ , which excludes small dwarf galaxies as sources , or even tidal tails .",
    "we can not think of any plausible external sources of dust that would be completely star free .",
    "in contrast , a known source of dust _ within _ the galaxies is m - star winds , which are thought to have been detected in both the mid - ir and far - ir ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this dust is injected uniformly throughout the galaxy and is not expected to clump .",
    "perhaps there is a thermal instability that causes the hot gas to cool into clumps , bringing dust with it .",
    "a thermal instability driven by dust cooling @xcite might play such a role .",
    "finding such a mechanism would bolster the internal origin theory .",
    "a second problem stems from the fact that the overall length for the settling cycle seems uncomfortably short , only at most a few times @xmath146 yr .",
    "if true , this points strongly to an internal origin for the dust , as the dynamical infall time from the edge of a galaxy is too long , more like 1 gyr . yet",
    "numerous studies have revealed galaxies in which the distribution and motions of ionized gas and dust seem _ unrelated _ to the motions of stars , and even counter - rotate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these data have been widely interpreted as incontrovertible evidence for the _ external _ origin of dust , at least in certain key objects .",
    "we have inspected our sample to identify our best candidates for external dust origin , using the simple criteria that the dust be extended and that its distribution over the galaxy differ strongly from that of the underlying starlight .",
    "six objects meet these criteria ( ngc 1316 , 2768 , 4026 , 4589 , 5018 , and 7727 ) .",
    "looking at them , it is indeed hard to imagine how the dust could have come from any quasi - uniform process _ inside _ these systems ( see the large - scale model - subtracted images noted in the footnote above ) .",
    "five of these objects have strong dust , and four also have strong optical emission , which would imply that strong nuclear activity is triggered by external accretion in at least these galaxies .",
    "this would be consistent with the finding that two of the strongest known liners ( ngc 4278 and ngc 1052 ) have external h i clouds in their vicinity @xcite as does ngc 5018 @xcite , another agn in our sample . on the other hand , @xcite searched for relationships between dust strength and external environments , finding no connection between dust and cluster versus group membership , or the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy .",
    "new data on the interstellar medium in ellipticals may help to solve this problem by _ overturning _ the old prediction that gas and star kinematics must agree .",
    "a consensus seems to be building that the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) in ellipticals is highly turbulent and is being stirred periodically by nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "stirring of the ism would strongly perturb warm ionized gas and dust , and would explain the many examples of highly irregular , disorganized velocity fields that are detected in warm gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "any dust and gas thrown out to the periphery of galaxies by stirring could be further perturbed by the passage of neighboring galaxies or the pressure of hot intracluster winds . in such a way , the motions of dust , gas , and stars might become strongly decoupled , giving the appearance of an external origin for clumpy gas and dust when none is required .",
    "the most important problem with the cycling picture is a clear idea of how all the stages fit together and what drives the whole cycle .",
    "why does dust begin to condense into clouds in the first place ?",
    "why does the black hole accrete only dust - related gas and not other gas ?",
    "what stops dust from condensing ?",
    "if it is feedback from the black hole , what exactly is its nature and how does it interface with dust and dust - related gas ?",
    "these questions are basic to the cycling model but currently lack answers .",
    "we conclude by highlighting the beautiful but puzzling object ngc 3607 ( figure [ fig : n3607 ] ) .",
    "this galaxy contains a large , dusty outer disk that must be dynamically old because of its extraordinary symmetry and tightly wrapped arms .",
    "however , this outer disk appears to transition rapidly but smoothly at the center to a second gas disk that is _ perpendicular _ to the first and is seen nearly edge on !",
    "this inclined disk seems to be settling onto an inclined nuclear ring .",
    "how can this happen ?",
    "a facile explanation would invoke external infall of gas directly into the galaxy center , yet no disturbance in the outer dust or other sign of an interaction is seen .",
    "thanks to its many regularities but schizophrenic nature , ngc 3607 may be a rosetta stone that will reward further study .",
    "we have examined the central structure of early - type galaxies ; a component of this analysis has included searching for morphological differences between core and power - law galaxies .",
    "we conclude by summarizing what this analysis might say about the formation of central structure in the context of hierarchical merging of galaxies with central black holes ; in @xcite we argued that cores and power - laws are different outcomes of this process .",
    "this discussion is largely speculative  while modern merger simulations are able to study the gross effects of mergers on central structure , there are few firm theoretical predictions of the phenomena considered in the analysis sections .",
    "the picture presented by @xcite is that power - law galaxies were formed by a process in which central _ gaseous _ dissipation and attendant star formation took place , while core galaxies were generated in the mergers of galaxies largely _ free of gas . _ the first generation of core galaxies",
    "would be made by merging power - laws , which themselves would harbor central black holes formed in the initial collapse of the primordial galaxy .",
    "the cores were formed in the final stage of the merger when the central black holes of the merging galaxies formed a binary that ejected stars from the center as it hardened .",
    "we can distill this scenario to be simply that power - law centers are sites of dissipation and concentration , while cores are sites of mixing and scattering .    in the case of color gradients ,",
    "this picture leads us to expect power - law galaxies to have stronger gradients than core galaxies . as star formation progresses following a merger or initial collapse of gas - rich systems ,",
    "the inventory of gas is simultaneously slowly depleted and centrally concentrated , while becoming increasingly metal - enriched .",
    "the stellar density profile would reflect both the concentration of gas over time and the metal - enrichment history . merging",
    "a then gas - free power - law galaxy with a similar system would not completely erase any pre - existing color gradients , but some dilution of the gradient might be expected .",
    "strong mixing of stars interior to the break radius associated with the formation of a core , however , might cause significant flattening of the gradient at small radii .",
    "the present data do show that power - law galaxies on average have steeper color gradients than do core galaxies , although the difference is small and the scatter about the mean gradient for both types is large . whether or not the color gradients in core galaxies flatten further interior to the break radius",
    "is unclear .",
    "there are some core galaxies that do appear to show this effect , but the majority do not .",
    "unfortunately , in absolute terms the envelope gradients in core galaxies are small to begin with , and it is thus especially difficult to detect even smaller gradients over a limited radial range . we conclude that color gradients are broadly consistent with the formation of cores by binary black holes with the caveat that the effects seen are modest in absolute terms",
    ".    the discovery that core galaxies twist interior to their break radii at first glance also appears to support the formation of cores by binary black holes . if the shape of the core is related to the angular momentum vector of the binary black hole , which itself may have little to do with the principal axes of the merged galaxy , then it is easy to imagine that twists occur as one transitions from the outer regions of the core into the inner region dominated by the black hole .",
    "however , our analysis shows that the absolute physical significance of the twists must also be considered .",
    "since the inner twists of both cores and power - laws are about the same in terms of the strength of the photometric perturbation required to twist the galaxy , it is not possible to argue that the _ angularly _ larger twists in core galaxies are a consequence of their particular formation mechanism .",
    "the interpretation of nuclei in early - type galaxies depends on whether the nuclei are the non - stellar emission of low - level agn , or are star clusters of the sort seen in m33 .",
    "the existence of nuclear star clusters in cores raises a few questions . in @xcite",
    "we argued that the survival of cores , once created , against infalling material in subsequent mergers requires the central black hole to serve as a `` guardian '' that tidally disrupts any dense stellar aggregates that reach the center , a notion that has been validated by n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that nuclear star clusters can not be pre - existing systems that have arrived at the center through dynamical friction .",
    "the likely alternative is that such nuclei were created _ in situ _ by the central accretion of small amounts of gas with subsequent star formation .",
    "this scenario may be supported by the bluer colors of the nuclei if they indicate that the nuclei are younger than the rest of the central stellar population .",
    "the remaining issue is to understand how converting any infalling gas into stars competes with accretion into the black hole , itself .",
    "the same problem exists in the center of our own galaxy , where a very young star cluster surrounds a central black hole ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that while formation of nuclear clusters is an interesting problem , their existence does not offer any obvious insight into the formation of core versus power - law galaxies .",
    "this conclusion also applies to agn , which in this sample offer little more than a ratification of the already standard notion that black holes are likely to exist at the centers of both types of galaxies .",
    "the discovery of two more galaxies that have central minima in their brightness distributions in addition to the galaxies discussed in @xcite implies that @xmath147 of core galaxies have such structures . as noted in @xcite , there are two competing ideas for the formation of these objects . in the first scenario , central minima might be explained by diffuse tori of stars added to a pre - existing core .",
    "the tori result from the tidal disruption of dense stellar aggregates transported to the center of the galaxy by dynamical friction following a merger ; again , the black hole prevents the core once established from being filled in by latter mergers . in a second and more speculative scenario ,",
    "the central minima are a direct consequence of stars ejected from the galaxy center by a binary black hole",
    ". it may be noteworthy that ngc 4073 and a number of the galaxies discussed in @xcite have relatively high luminosities . in the discussion in that paper",
    ", we advanced the hypothesis that the mergers of two galaxies each with pre - existing cores , as would occur at the high - mass ends of a merging hierarchy , might be the necessary precondition for generating a merged galaxy in which the core was actually evacuated by the binary black hole . under this picture",
    ", galaxies with central minima would be vivid examples of the action of binary black holes on central structure ; however , present theoretical and observational treatment of this problem leaves this as an unproven hypothesis .",
    "likewise , we presently do not know what bearing galaxies with offset centers have on understanding the formation of central structure .",
    "if these systems are indeed unresolved analogs of the m31 nucleus , then their role may be more to show how nuclear black holes can stabilize non - axisymmetric structures in galaxy centers .",
    "in @xcite we noted that power - law galaxies have disky outer isophotes ; the conclusion here that all inclined power - law galaxies have visible stellar disks , with the implication that disks exist in _ all _ power - law galaxies , supports the dissipative formation scenario for power - law galaxies .",
    "conversely , the corresponding lack of disks in all but the lowest - luminosity core galaxies supports their formation in dissipationless gas - free processes .",
    "a transition zone in galaxy luminosity where the dissipation and dissipationless stellar processes compete in mergers may explain the disks in the lower - luminosity galaxies with cores .",
    "lastly , the rounder shapes of the inner isophotes of core galaxies as compared to power - law galaxies may be a direct consequence of core formation by a binary black hole on the presumption that scattering of stars by the binary is most likely to be nearly isotropic .    in the final analysis section , we have reasoned that the high prevalence of clumpy dust in non - equilibrium conditions means that it is generated in processes interior to the galaxies , themselves .",
    "we have further argued that dust clouds once created settle into the center , and are eventual destroyed or processed by the galaxy on time scales of @xmath3 yr .",
    "the continued existence of dust clouds in a substantial fraction of early - type galaxies suggests that dust clouds are formed and destroyed in a cyclical process .",
    "the strong link between the presence of dust and nuclear emission argues that one outcome of this process would be episodic delivery of matter to the centers of the galaxies ; understanding the secular evolution of cores may have to take this into account . at the same time",
    "we see no properties of present - day dust that bear one way or another on the basic formation mechanism of cores versus power - laws .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears that the diverse morphological measures derived for galaxies here give at most weak evidence for differences between core and power - law galaxies that might be taken as support for the binary black hole core formation mechanism .",
    "dust is formed equally in both types , and the nuclei offer no apparent insight into this problem . understanding the galaxies with central minima may offer a useful path for understanding core formation , but presently the mechanisms for forming central minima are too uncertain for forming conclusions .",
    "position - angle twists , when properly normalized , seem equally strong in both types .",
    "cores do have shallower color gradients , as expected , but the effect is weak .",
    "the strongest evidence comes from the rounder inner isophotes of cores and , more important , the high frequency of disks in the centers of power - law galaxies and ( to a lesser degree ) in the fainter core galaxies .",
    "overall the evidence is consistent with the binary black hole core formation mechanism , but it is not a strong endorsement .",
    "the real value of our data , we feel , is not in current tests of core formation , but in providing a rich set of observations that can be used to confront future models .",
    "any successful model will have to match the large suite of quantitative data produced in this paper .",
    "finally , we note that this paper does not consider the fundamental radial distribution of starlight in galaxies , which distinguishes cores from power - laws in the first place .",
    "this is the topic that taken up in paper vi , where we demonstrate a strong dichotomy between the two types , validating the assumption of two classes in this paper .",
