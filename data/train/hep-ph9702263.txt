    "the prediction using the grv parton distributions  @xcite agrees within 3% over the whole kinematic range .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] that the total drell  yan asymmetry @xmath86 changes with the invariant mass @xmath4 .",
    "the change is however not uniform over the whole range in @xmath1 or @xmath2 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for the polarized gs(a ) parton distributions .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the asymmetry can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xfdef ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry around @xmath87 always probes the polarized parton distributions in beam  @xmath88 and target  @xmath89 around @xmath90 . if @xmath1 is increased towards its positive kinematic limit , @xmath65 increases towards 1 while @xmath66 decreases only slightly .",
    "decreasing @xmath1 towards the negative kinematic limit yields a small decrease of @xmath65 while @xmath66 increases towards 1 .",
    "the region @xmath91 therefore probes the @xmath11-dependence of the parton distributions in the beam hadron , while @xmath92 is sensitive on the target hadron structure .",
    "moreover , different invariant masses correspond to different @xmath11 intervals probed .",
    "a similar argumentation , based on eq .  ( [ eq : ydef ] ) , applies to the @xmath2-dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "the contributions of the individual subprocesses ( @xmath93annihilation at leading and next - to - leading order and quark  gluon compton scattering ) to the polarized drell  yan cross section are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "all curves are obtained with the polarized gs(a ) parton densities and are shown for @xmath94  gev .",
    "all polarized subprocess contributions are normalized to the _ full _ unpolarized cross section at next - to - leading order .",
    "the relative magnitude of the individual contributions is similar to the unpolarized drell  yan process .",
    "the @xmath0 correction to the @xmath93annihilation process enhances significantly the lowest order prediction while the quark  gluon compton process contributes with a sign opposite to the annihilation process .",
    "however , the relative magnitude of annihilation and compton process depends on the magnitude of the gluon distribution at large @xmath11 , which is completely undetermined at present  @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty prevents a sensible prediction of a @xmath95factor between the cross sections at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the prediction for the drell  yan asymmetry if both polarized and unpolarized cross section are evaluated using the leading order @xmath96-coefficient function only ( long  dashed line ) .",
    "the sizable shift between the leading and next - to - leading order predictions for the drell  yan asymmetry seems to contradict the claim  @xcite that the next - to - leading order corrections , although large in polarized and unpolarized cross sections , would largely cancel in the drell  yan asymmetry .",
    "the change of physical quantities such as cross sections or asymmetries under variations of the ( unphysical ) mass factorization scale @xmath78 enables an estimate of the numerical importance of unknown higher order corrections .",
    "we quantify this uncertainty in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , showing the drell  yan asymmetry for @xmath97 .",
    "it can be seen that the absolute value of the asymmetry changes less than 0.01 in the central region . even in the region where @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) approaches its kinematic limit ,",
    "the absolute value of the asymmetry changes only by a maximum of 0.015 .",
    "this stability is crucial for an estimate of the theoretical error on the polarized sea quark distributions extracted from the polarized drell  yan process .",
    "a final point briefly concerns phenomenological aspects of the polarized drell  yan process , although this is not the principal aim of the present paper .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig7 ] and  [ fig : fig8 ] show the drell  yan asymmetry in polarized proton  proton and proton  deuterium collisions for @xmath94  gev as predicted by using the different polarized parton distributions suggested in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the different predictions vary within a band of @xmath98 in @xmath12 and @xmath99 in @xmath16 collisions .",
    "this uncertainty reflects the present lack of knowledge on the polarization of the light quark sea in the proton at @xmath100 .",
    "the difference between the predictions is furthermore substantially larger than the theoretical uncertainty due to the choice of the factorization scale .    due to the smaller overall valence quark polarization in deuterium ,",
    "one finds the asymmetry in @xmath16 collisions to be systematically smaller than in @xmath12 collisions .",
    "although the normalization of the asymmetry in the proton direction ( @xmath101 ) and in the deuteron direction ( @xmath102 ) is slightly different , its shape is still very similar in both regions .",
    "this reflects the assumption of an su(2)@xmath103symmetry of the polarized antiquark sea , which is used in all polarized parton distributions displayed in the figure .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath1-(or @xmath2-)dependence of the drell  yan asymmetry in @xmath16 collisions could therefore test this assumption .",
    "we have presented a complete calculation of the @xmath0 corrections to the @xmath1- and @xmath2-dependence of the longitudinally polarized drell  yan cross section in the @xmath32scheme .",
    "the results for the @xmath2-dependence and the mass distribution agree ( after suitable change of the factorization scheme ) with earlier results in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the impact of these corrections on the polarized drell  yan cross section is very similar to the impact of the unpolarized corrections .",
    "the corrections due to the individual subprocesses turn out to be sizable .",
    "however , a @xmath95factor between leading and next - to - leading order results can at present not be sensibly predicted due to the uncertainty on the magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "the corrections derived in this paper are of particular importance for the extraction of the polarized sea quark distributions from measurements of the drell  yan process .",
    "as discussed above , a measurement of the asymmetry as function of @xmath1 or @xmath2 can be directly inferred into the @xmath11-dependence of the polarized sea quark distributions .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be furthermore immediately   keeping in mind the limitations discussed in the introduction   applied to the production of massive vector bosons in polarized proton ",
    "proton collisions at rhic  @xcite .    with the knowledge of the next - to - leading order corrections ,",
    "it is furthermore possible to quantify the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction and hence the theoretical error on a measurement of the polarized sea quark distributions .",
    "we have demonstrated that the absolute value of the drell  yan asymmetry in the central region varies by less than 0.01 under variation of the mass factorization scale , demonstrating the perturbative stability of the prediction .",
