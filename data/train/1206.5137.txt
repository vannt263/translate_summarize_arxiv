    "the models in extra dimensions have been proposed for solving the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scales @xcite . among these",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model assumes the existence of two 3-branes connected by one extra spatial dimension and the metric in this model is non - factorizable @xcite .",
    "the extra spatial coordinate has been orbifolded by the symmetry @xmath3 and one of the 3-branes can be identified as the visible brane and the other as the planck brane .",
    "the warp factor in this model suppresses any planck scale quantities into electroweak scale on the visible brane . in the rs model , all the standard model fields",
    "are assumed to be confined on the visible brane and only gravity propagates in the bulk of the five dimensions .",
    "subsequently , the rs model was generalized to include other bulk fields in order to explain physical quantities such as neutrino masses and mixing pattern which normally can not be explained within the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the deficit in the solar and atmospheric neutrino flux has given evidence for non - zero masses to neutrinos @xcite .",
    "fitting to the data of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , the following set of mass - square differences are obtained : @xmath4 ev@xmath5 and @xmath6 ev@xmath5 @xcite . here , @xmath7 are the mass eigenvalues of the 3 active neutrinos . apart from the mass - square differences an upper limit on the neutrino masses have been found through other experiments .",
    "tritium @xmath8-decay puts an upper limit on the neutrino mass scale to be of the order of 2 ev @xcite .",
    "whereas from the cosmological observations , the sum of the three neutrino masses needs to be less than about 1 ev @xcite .",
    "since all the above experiments suggest tiny values for neutrino masses , perhaps a different mechanism should be operational for neutrino mass generation as compared to other fermion masses .",
    "to explain the smallness of neutrino masses in the framework of rs model , an additional singlet neutrino field has been proposed , which like gravity field , propagates in the entire bulk of space - time @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the bulk neutrino field is extended in the extra spatial dimension .",
    "the boundary conditions for this wave function can be chosen in such a way that it will have a very small overlap on our visible brane , resulting in tiny masses for neutrinos .",
    "the phenomenology of this model is determined through the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the bulk neutrino field .",
    "since the bulk neutrino field is singlet under the standard model gauge group , detection of kk modes of this field is challenging in the collider experiments .",
    "however , the loop effects due to these fields to any physically observable quantity can give us some hints about its existence .",
    "here , we study one of such observable quantities , namely the anomalous magnetic moment of muon .    at the tree level ,",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , @xmath9-factor , has a value of 2 and radiative contributions give some corrections to it .",
    "hence , it can be quantified as @xmath10 . for a review on @xmath0 ,",
    "see @xcite . the world average value of @xmath0",
    "after the experiment e821 at the brookhaven national laboratory is as given below @xcite @xmath11 which is obtained with a precision of 0.54 parts per million .",
    "various groups have computed the theoretical value for @xmath0 in the standard model .",
    "most of the groups have found a discrepancy between the experiment and the corresponding standard model value of @xmath0 at about @xmath12 level @xcite . here",
    ", we take this difference as follows @xcite @xmath13 the above difference would indicate existence of new physics .",
    "moreover , since this difference is positive , the contribution due to new physics to @xmath0 should yield a net positive value .    as explained before , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , kk neutrinos can give some contribution to @xmath0 , which we have computed in this work .",
    "previously , some work in this direction has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have obtained a negative contribution to the @xmath0 by adopting mass insertion approximation in the unitary gauge . in the present work , by carrying out an exact analysis in the mass eigenstate basis , we have computed the contribution from the bulk neutrino field to the @xmath0 in the t hooft - feynman gauge and scan the parameter space in the region consistent with experimental bounds .",
    "we have found that the bulk neutrino contribution to @xmath0 has the right sign to fit the above mentioned discrepancy in @xmath0 .",
    "we have also incorporated contributions from other sources such as gravitons to the @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we have studied the constraints that may arise from these various sources of @xmath0 in the parameter space defined in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite , constraints have been obtained from lepton flavor violation by considering a set of models in the rs frame work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief description of the warped extra dimensional model for neutrino masses @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 , we have computed the contribution of bulk neutrino field to @xmath0 in the t hooft - feynman gauge . in this section , we have also performed a detailed phenomenological study of our obtained expression for @xmath0 . in sec . 4 , we describe possible constraints on the model parameters of @xcite by including contributions to @xmath0 from other sources such as gravitons .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "as described before , the model @xcite is based on the rs model , where an additional singlet neutrino field is introduced in the bulk of the 5-dimensional space - time .",

    ", @xmath28 is a bulk mass parameter which is @xmath29 .",
    "the above action is invariant under @xmath30 , which should follow due to the @xmath31 orbifolding of the rs model .",
    "this symmetry is known as @xmath19-parity which sets some boundary conditions on the wave functions of @xmath21 .",
    "the bulk field @xmath21 decomposes into kk modes in the 4-dimensional world , which can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the left- and right - handed kk modes in the 4-dimensions and @xmath35 are its corresponding wave functions . in order to have the following canonically normalized action for the kk modes in 4-dimensions @xmath36 the wave functions @xmath37 should satisfy the following conditions @xmath38 here , @xmath39 are the masses of kk modes . in the above equations , the following change of variables have been done : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this change of variables imply that @xmath43 corresponds to the visible brane .",
    "the unknown quantities in the above equation are : @xmath44 the @xmath19-parity , which is described above , imposes the following boundary conditions on the wave functions : @xmath45 .",

    "the wave function for the zeroth mode can be written as @xmath47 the zeroth mode wave function of the right - handed field is highly suppressed on the visible brane , for @xmath48 .",
    "because of this reason , by choosing the boundary condition as @xmath49 , we can achieve a very small overlap of the singlet bulk field on the visible brane , for @xmath48 . using this mechanism , in the next paragraph",
    ", we describe the neutrino masses in this model .",
    "the invariant action for neutrino yukawa interaction is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a left - handed lepton doublet and @xmath52 is the conjugate of the higgs doublet . here",
    "@xmath53 has mass dimensions of @xmath54 and the metric on the visible brane is @xmath55 and @xmath56 . both the lepton and higgs doublets need to have the following rescaling : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , in order to have canonical kinetic terms for these fields . after substituting the kk mode expansion , eq .",

    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 here , the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is @xmath64 174 gev .",
    "now , define @xmath65 then the physical masses are given by @xmath66 while diagonalizing the matrix @xmath67 , the masses @xmath39 of kk modes are determined by the equation @xmath68 .",
    "however , the masses @xmath39 are not the physical masses of kk modes , since they get correction due to mixing with the left - handed lepton doublet after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "after diagonalizing the matrix @xmath67 , the lowest mass eigenvalue can be shown to be proportional to @xmath69 which yields a very small value due to small overlap of the wave function @xmath70 .",
    "the mass of light neutrino can be shown to be @xcite @xmath71 so far we have assumed the presence of only one bulk neutrino field and it generates one light dirac neutrino mass . as explained in the previous section , to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we need at least two non - zero neutrino mass eigenstates . hence , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite we have to propose more than one bulk neutrino field .",
    "however , it has been argued in @xcite that to cancel the anomalies related to @xmath19-parity , only even number of singlet bulk fields can be introduced into the model .",
    "so , by introducing two bulk neutrino fields with slightly different bulk mass parameters , @xmath28 , we can fit both the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass scales . in this picture",
    "the third neutrino has exactly zero mass .",
    "however , by introducing 4 bulk neutrino fields in an analogous way , we can generate all the three light neutrino masses .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that to generate neutrino masses , the kk modes of bulk neutrino field have some mixing with the left - handed lepton doublet .",
    "this mixing would lead to gauge as well as yukawa type interactions of muon with the physical kk modes of neutrinos . as a result of this ,",

    "we comment on our results on the contribution of bulk neutrino to @xmath0 . as already explained before that we have computed the contribution from fig . 1 in the t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "the first three diagrams of fig . 1 have given positive contributions , while the fig .",

    ", we have found that in most of the parameter space the contribution from fig .",
    "1(d ) is dominant and it gives a net positive contribution .",
    "specifically , we have seen that the negative and positive contributions are comparable to each other but the magnitude of the former one is at least an @xmath93 less than the later one in @xmath94 .",
    "another comment is that , since there are two insertions of yukawa couplings in fig .",
    "1(d ) we would expect the contribution to @xmath0 to increase with @xmath60 . in our numerical analysis",
    "we have found that this is true but there are some exceptions to this , which we will explain in our numerical results .",
    "the total contribution of one bulk neutrino field to the @xmath0 is @xmath95 the above contribution is mainly dependent on @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the 5-dimensional bulk mass parameter @xmath28 , which altogether determine the kk masses of the bulk neutrino field .",
    "apart from this , @xmath98 also depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath60 which determine the elements of the unitary matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 . on the other hand , the light neutrino mass eigenvalue due to one bulk neutrino field , depends on @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath60 . as described in sec .",
    "1 , from the neutrino oscillation data we have some idea on the magnitude of neutrino masses . for instance , in the hierarchical pattern of neutrinos at least two mass eigenvalues should be : @xmath101 ev and @xmath102 ev . in this case , the third neutrino can have either zero mass or its mass should be less than of the order of @xmath103 . in the case of degenerate neutrinos ,",
    "all the three neutrinos should have a nearly equal mass and the common mass eigenvalue should be sufficiently larger than @xmath104 . since an upper bound from the cosmological observations indicate that the sum of the three neutrino masses should be less than about 1 ev @xcite , we take the common mass to be as @xmath105 ev . by fixing the mass eigenvalues of light neutrinos , we may eliminate @xmath96 as independent variable .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 should be @xmath93 and here we take its value in the range 0.1 to 2.5 . here",
    "the lower limit of 0.1 is due to the naturalness argument and the upper limit is due to perturbativity constraints . in order not to hit the landau pole , the yukawa couplings @xmath106 should be less than @xmath107 . for @xmath46 , @xmath108 and",
    "hence @xmath60 should be less than @xmath109 2.5 .",
    "as for the bulk mass parameter @xmath28 , we take its value close to the planck scale . we take the values of @xmath97 to be around 12 , since for this set of values we can produce tev scale masses on the visible brane from the exponential warping . finally , in our numerical analysis , we have allowed a 50@xmath11050 mixing mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ e : mixmas ] ) .",
    "after diagonalizing this matrix we get 49 kk neutrino mass modes which we have summed in the @xmath98 .",

    "the upper three curves are due to a bulk mass of @xmath111 gev and the remaining three lower curves are for @xmath112 gev .",
    "the three curves are arising depending on whether the light neutrino mass eigenvalue fits the solar , or atmospheric , or degenerate mass eigenvalue .",

    "2(b ) are same as that of fig .",

    "for one particular value of @xmath60 , the contribution due to a bulk neutrino field which fits the solar , or atmospheric , or degenerate neutrino is nearly the same .",
    "this is evident in both the figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , where the three curves due to different neutrino mass eigenvalues are close to each other .",
    "we can understand the reason for this as follows . for fixed values of @xmath60 , @xmath97 and @xmath28",
    ", the change in the value of @xmath113 from one curve to the other curve can happen only due to the change in the neutrino mass eigenvalue .",
    "the ratio of neutrino mass eigenvalues between degenerate and solar cases could be at most by a factor of @xmath114 . from eq .",
    "( [ e : mnu ] ) , it can be seen that the neutrino mass eigenvalue is related to @xmath96 dominantly through exponential factor , so we need only a change of @xmath1150.1 in @xmath96 to produce a change of factor @xmath114 in the mass eigenvalue .",
    "these exact numerical values in the change of @xmath96 due to change in the neutrino mass eigenvalue can be seen in tab . 1 , where ranges of @xmath96 are given for extreme values of @xmath60 .",
    "such a small change in @xmath96 produces a slight change in the kk masses of neutrino fields , and hence a slight change to the @xmath98 .",
    "however , a closer examination would reveal that the amount of @xmath113 where solar mass is fitted is slightly more than that for atmospheric mass which is even slightly more than that for degenerate mass .",
    "the change in these three cases could be at most in the first decimal place of @xmath113 value .",
    "the values of @xmath96 in these three cases would be different even though @xmath60 could be same .",
    "we have presented the ranges of @xmath96 for the cases of @xmath97 = 12.5 and 12.0 in tab .",
    "1 .    .ranges of @xmath96 for different values of @xmath97 and for different masses of light neutrino mass eigenvalues . in a particular range of @xmath96 ,",
    "the left- and right - end corresponds to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of @xmath118 , two kk gravitons can exist to fit the @xmath0 .",
    "the above analysis done for @xmath119 can be repeated for @xmath118 and we can get bounds on the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath96 accordingly . however , if we include the contribution of the order of 10 kk gravitons then @xmath97 should be close to 11.7 . in this case , by comparing the curves for @xmath120 of fig .",
    "3 , for @xmath28 close to @xmath121 gev , a single bulk neutrino can contribute an order of @xmath122 to @xmath0 .",
    "so for this choice of @xmath28 we can get upper limits on @xmath60 and @xmath96 . however , if the number of kk gravitons is of the order of 100 then @xmath97 should be around 11.3 .",
    "for this low value of @xmath97 , a single bulk neutrino contribution would be at most @xmath123 even for @xmath124 gev .",
    "hence the constraints on the bulk neutrino parameters would be less stringent in this case .",
    "finally , to comment on the radion contribution to @xmath0 , the constraints on the bulk neutrinos which are described above may become even severe if the radion mass is less than about 200 gev .    in the previous paragraph",
    "we have described constraints on the bulk neutrino parameters which are arising purely from the @xmath125 deviation of @xmath126 . however , these constraints can be even stringent by including other observable quantities such as @xmath127 .",
    "the current experiments have not found the decay @xmath128 and put an upper limit on its branching ratio as @xmath129 at 90@xmath130 cl @xcite . in the context of the warped model @xcite , this decay channel has been studied in @xcite . to satisfy the upper bound on @xmath127 and to get an appreciable contribution from @xmath113",
    ", we may have to fine - tune the yukawa couplings .",
    "it is interesting to study these effects but this is out of the scope of the current work .",
    "finally , we comment that in this work we have studied correlation between neutrino mass eigenstate and @xmath0 for a single generation .",
    "we hope to extend this to include all the generations in a future work .",
    "some related work in the context of different models has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the rs model , which is based on the warp geometry , is elegant to explain the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak scales @xcite .",
    "subsequently it was shown that such model can offer possible explanation of the origin of small neutrino masses when the right handed component of the neutrino is allowed to propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the signals of such a model lies in the detection of kk modes of the bulk neutrino field . in this work ,",
    "we have studied an indirect signal of these kk modes , _",
    "i.e. _ the virtual effects of these kk modes to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , @xmath0 .",
    "we have computed the contribution of bulk neutrino to @xmath0 at one loop level in the t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "comparing our result with the experimental limits , we have found that this contribution comes with the right sign so as to fit with experimental data .",
    "moreover , in some of the parameter space of the model in @xcite , the @xmath125 discrepancy of @xmath0 can be accommodated .",
    "we have also studied how the bulk neutrino contribution would be restricted by including the graviton contribution to @xmath0 .",
