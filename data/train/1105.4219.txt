    "in the recent past glashow and cohen @xcite proposed the interesting idea of a very special relativity .",
    "by very special relativity ( vsr ) the above mentioned authors meant a theory which is constituted by subgroups of the lorentz group , but amazingly , these subgroup transformations keep the velocity of light invariant in inertial frames and time - dilation remains the same as in special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "velocity addition has been studied in vsr theories @xcite and there has been an attempt to utilize the vsr theory as the theory of space - time transformations of dark matter candidates @xcite . in a parallel development",
    "some authors have attempted to incorporate the framework of vsr in non - commutative space - times @xcite .",
    "the specialty of vsr is that it can produce the constancy of light velocity and time - dilation with much smaller subgroups of the lorentz group .",
    "going by standard convention where @xmath1 specify the boost generators and @xmath2 specify the angular momentum generators of the full lorentz group , there are four subgroups of the lorentz group which exhausts all the candidates of vsr",
    ". one of the four possible versions of a theory of vsr has just two generators , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this group is called @xmath5 .",
    "if in addition to the above generators of @xmath5 one adds another generator @xmath6 then the resulting group is called @xmath7 . instead of adding @xmath6 if one includes @xmath8 as the third generator in addition to the two generators of @xmath5 one attains another subgroup of the lorentz group which",
    "is called @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , if some one includes both @xmath6 and @xmath8 in addition to the two generators of @xmath5 then one obtains another subgroup of the lorentz group which is called the @xmath9 .",
    "these above four subgroups of the lorentz group which admits of local energy - momentum conservation collectively form the main body of vsr transformations .",
    "the topic which still remains untouched is related to the topic of length contraction in vsr . till",
    "now none of the papers on vsr has clearly stated about the way how lengths of moving rods differ from their proper length . in this article",
    "we discuss about length transformations in vsr .",
    "to do so we use the subgroup @xmath0 . this subgroup preserves similarity transformations or homotheties .",
    "it is seen that the length transformation formulas in vsr are dramatically different from the one we have in sr . in vsr",
    "we observe length contraction but this contraction is not equivalent to the one found in sr .",
    "more over length - contraction in vsr is direction dependent .",
    "if a rod is placed along the @xmath10-direction of the fixed frame @xmath11 and the moving frame , @xmath12 , moves with an uniform velocity along the @xmath10 - @xmath13 axes then the length transformation formula in vsr is exactly the same as in sr .",
    "but if the rod is placed along the @xmath14-axis ( @xmath15-axis ) in the @xmath11 frame and the @xmath12 frame moves with an uniform velocity along @xmath14 - @xmath16 axes ( @xmath15 - @xmath17 axes ) then the length transformation relation is not the same as found in sr .",
    "more over for very high velocities there is no length - contraction along the @xmath14 or @xmath15 axes motion .",
    "the other important find in this article is that the phenomenon of length contraction is not symmetrical in the frames @xmath11 and @xmath12 . by symmetrical",
    "we mean that if the rod is kept at rest in the @xmath12 frame , which is moving with respect to frame @xmath11 with velocity @xmath18 , and the observer is in the @xmath11 frame then the length contraction results does not in general match with the case where the rod is at rest in the @xmath11 frame and the observer is in @xmath12 frame .",
    "this phenomenon arises because the vsr transformation which links the coordinates of the primed frame to the unprimed frame is not the same as the inverse transformation with the sign of the velocity changed .",
    "the results presented in the article can be experimentally tested in heavy ion collisions and future experiments in lhc .",
    "the experiments can conclusively state whether vsr can actually replace sr in describing the subtleties of nature .",
    "the material in this article is presented in the following format .",

    "the notations and conventions are introduced and using them the expressions of the @xmath0 transformation and its inverse transformations are deduced .",

    "the ultimate section [ disc ] presents the conclusion with a brief discussion of the results derived in this article .",
    "for the sake of completeness we attach two appendices as appendix [ app1 ] and appendix [ app2 ] where the @xmath0 transformation matrix and its inverse are derived explicitly .",
    "the _ hom_(2 ) subgroup of the lorentz group consists of 3 generators @xmath19 and @xmath8 where @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s are the generators of lorentz boosts and 3-space rotations respectively .",

    "the signs of the resulting sr transformation matrix matches with the sign of our @xmath47 .",

    "( [ zprime ] ) gives length contractions .",
    "from the above analysis of length transformations in vsr we see that in general the vsr results and sr result do not match .",

    "there are two frames @xmath11 and @xmath12 which coincides with each other at @xmath56 .",

    "if the rod is kept along any axes in the @xmath12 frame and one measures its length from @xmath11 frame then the length transformations do not coincide with the sr results .",
    "but interestingly if the rod is sliding along any common axes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 frame then we get the exact sr length contraction results .",
    "consequently if the observer is in @xmath11 frame and the rod is oriented along any 3-axes , where the particular axis is along the direction of the relative velocity @xmath18 , one will never discover whether the theory of relativity is sr or vsr .",
    "this difference between sr and vsr becomes more blurred because as in sr in vsr also the velocity of light is independent of the reference frame and the time - dilation formula is exactly the same as in sr .",
    "on the other hand if the rod is at rest in the @xmath11 frame itself and the observer is in the @xmath12 frame then the length transformation formulas are different from sr if the orientation of the rod and the relative velocity is along the @xmath14 or @xmath15 axes .",
    "but if the rod is placed along the @xmath10 axis in the @xmath11 frame and the frame @xmath12 also moves along the @xmath10 axis of the @xmath11 frame with velocity @xmath43 then the length of the rod measured in the @xmath12 frame is contracted in the same way as one expects from sr .    from the forms of @xmath31 and @xmath48 as given in eq .",

    "( [ luinv ] ) it is observed that @xmath48 is not obtained from @xmath31 by putting a minus sign in front of all the velocity components appearing in the expression of @xmath31 .",
    "this is the cause of different length contraction formulas for two different frames as shown in the last section .",
    "the interesting thing about vsr is that inspite of these _ asymmetric _ nature of the transformations , the square of the line element remains invariant as in sr and consequently the time - dilation formulas remain exactly the same as in sr .",
    "the length contraction formulas in vsr do depend upon the sign of @xmath43 which shows that the amount of contraction of length of a moving rod depends upon its direction of motion along the @xmath10 or @xmath13-axes .",
    "if vsr is really the theory which nature follows , may be in the very high energy sector or near the electro - weak symmetry breaking scale , then one may hope to see the effects of vsr length contractions in the lhc or in future colliders . at present",
    "there is no confirmation of any difference of the length contraction results obtained from sr . in nearby future heavy ion collision experiments and other related experiments",
    "can really be done to look for any discrepancy of the length contraction formulas from sr .",
    "in conclusion it must be stated that in this article we have studied how a moving rod s length changes from its rest length in vsr and specifically in the @xmath0 version of vsr .",
    "length contraction is observed for all the cases but there are some variation in the transformation equations in contrast to that in sr , although sr results are reproduced in many special cases of vsr .",
    "the other important conclusion is related to the fact that in general the phenomenon of length contraction of a rod in vsr do depend upon the frame from which one observes , a fact which is very difficult to accept in any relativistic theory .",
