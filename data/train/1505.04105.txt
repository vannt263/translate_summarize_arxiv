    "( [ jm ] ) , the corresponding @xmath52-@xmath130 plot can be obtained , which provides an extra test of the conclusion from the @xmath41-@xmath42 plot .",
    "when further checking the relation of masses of high - spin mesons with the principle quantum number @xmath131 , we find that there exists a symmetry of the spectrum in the form @xmath132 where this phenomenon argues in favor of the existence of the principle quantum that governs the spectrum of excited mesons indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly explain the qpc model adopted in this work .",
    "after the qpc model was proposed by micu @xcite , it was further developed by the orsay group @xcite .",

    "@xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) is an orbital magnetic momentum of the corresponding meson in the decay .",
    "@xmath139 is the amplitude we calculate .",
    "the @xmath140 operator reads as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a parameter that takes the value 8.7 or @xmath143 when the quark - antiquark pair created from the vacuum is @xmath144 or @xmath145 @xcite .",

    ", the amplitude @xmath139 can be converted into the partial wave amplitude @xmath151 , i.e. , @xmath152 finally , the decay width can be given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the mass of the initial meson @xmath155 .",
    "in the concrete calculation , we use the harmonic oscillator wave function to describe the meson spatial wave function .",
    "the harmonic oscillator wave function has the following expression @xmath156 , with @xmath157 being a parameter , which is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the mesons involved in our calculation .    before performing the phenomenological analysis of these high - spin mesons ,",

    "for example , the meson with @xmath158 is the mixture between the @xmath2 and @xmath91 states is the mixture between the @xmath162 and @xmath163 states , the meson with @xmath164 is from the mixture between the @xmath91 and @xmath165 states , and the meson with @xmath166 is due to the mixture between the @xmath163 and @xmath167 states ] . by our calculation , we find that the contribution of the higher orbital quantum number for these high - spin mesons with @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is far smaller than that of the lower orbital quantum number when we study their decay behavior .",
