    "in @xcite a @xmath0-weighted version of the robinson - schensted algorithm was introduced . in this paper",
    "we show that this algorithm enjoys a symmetry property analoguous to the well - known symmetry property of the robinson - schensted algorithm .",
    "the proof uses a generalisation of the growth diagram approach introduced by @xcite .",
    "the insertion algorithm we consider in this paper is based on column insertion , but the technique applies to any insertion algorithm belonging to a certain class of `` branching insertion algorithms '' , as described in section [ s : other ] below .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently introduced a @xmath0-weighted version of the row insertion algorithm , which is defined similarly to the column insertion version of @xcite ; they also consider a wider family of such algorithms ( and , more generally , dynamics on gelfand - tsetlin patterns ) , some of which fall into the framework considered in the present paper , and can similarly be shown to have the symmetry property .",
    "we discuss such extensions in section [ s : other ] below .",
    "the robinson - schensted ( rs ) algorithm is a combinatorial algorithm which was introduced by robinson @xcite and schensted @xcite .",
    "it has wide applications in representation theory and probability theory , e.g. last passage percolation , totally asymmetric simple exclusion process / corner growth model , random matrix theory @xcite , queues in tandem @xcite and more .",
    "there are two versions of rs algorithms , the row insertion and column insertion version . in most of this paper",
    "we deal with column insertion and its @xmath0-version .",
    "the rs algorithm transforms a word to a tableau pair of the same shape .",
    "a word can be treated as a path , hence a random word corresponds to a random walk .",
    "when taking such a random walk , the shape of the output tableaux is a markov chain , whose transition kernel is related to the schur symmetric functions @xcite .",
    "a geometric generalisation transforms a brownian motion with drift to a markov process whose generator is related to @xmath1-whittaker functions @xcite , which are eigenfunctions of the quantum toda chain @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-whittaker functions on the one hand are a generalisation of the schur symmetric functions and a specialisation of macdonald @xmath2-symmetric functions when @xmath3 @xcite , and on the other hand are eigenfunctions of the @xmath0-deformed quantum toda chain @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 they become the schur functions and when @xmath5 with a proper scaling @xcite they converge to whittaker functions . in the spirit of this connection ,",
    "a @xmath0-weighted robinson - schensted algorithm was formulated in @xcite , which transforms the random walk to a markov chain that is related to @xmath0-whittaker functions .    as is expected the algorithm degenerates to the normal rs algorithm when @xmath4 .",
    "part of the random @xmath6-tableau also has @xmath0-tasep dynamics @xcite , the latter introduced in @xcite , just as the same part of the random @xmath6-tableau of normal rs algorithm has tasep dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , a @xmath0-version of the rs row insertion algorithm was also introduced in @xcite .",
    "it denegerates to the normal rs algorithm with row insertion when @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we show that both algorithms enjoy a symmetry property analogous to the well - known symmetry property of the robinson - schensted algorithm . basically , the symmetry property for the robinson - schensted algorithms restricted to permutation inputs is the property that the output tableau pair is interchanged if the permutation is inversed .",
    "knuth @xcite generalised the normal row insertion algorithm to one which takes matrix input , which we refer to as robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) algorithm . for this algorithm",
    "the symmetry property is that the output tableau pair is interchanged if the matrix is transposed .",
    "note that the matrix becomes the permutation matrix when the rsk algorithm is restricted to permutation , hence the transposition of the matrix corresponds to inversion of the permutation .",
    "burge gives a similar generalisation of the column insertion algorithm @xcite , which we refer to as burge s algorithm .",
    "the symmetry property for the normal rs algorithm is normally discussed in the literature for the row insertion .",
    "however , in the permutation case the output tableau pair for row insertion is simply the transposition of the pair for column insertion .",
    "therefore proofs of the symmetry property can be translated to column insertion instantly . in the matrix input case ,",
    "the burge and rsk algorithms are also closely related so that proofs can be extended from one to the other naturally .    for",
    "a proof of the symmetry property one can see e.g. @xcite . there are a few different approaches to deal with it .",
    "one is the viennot diagram @xcite which provides a nice geometric construction of the rs algorithms . in the matrix input case",
    "there are two approaches which reduce to the viennot diagram approach when restricted to permutations .",
    "one is the antichain or the inversion digraph construction of the rsk algorithm ( which should extend naturally to the burge algorithm ) due to @xcite ; the other ( for both rsk and burge ) is fomin s matrix - ball construction of @xcite .",
    "another method is the growth diagram technique due to fomin @xcite .",
    "it can be generalised to the rsk and burge algorithms .",
    "theorem @xcite gives a proof by showing the relation between the lengths of the longest subsequences of the input and the shape of the output .",
    "however , the growth diagram approach can be thought of as a fast construction to calculate these lengths .    among all these techniques , the special structure of growth diagram can be extended to a class of algorithms what we will call branching algorithms , which include the @xmath0-weighted column and row insertion algorithms .",
    "therefore it is this approach which we use in this paper . for a simple description of the technique for normal row insertion see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "whose column version will be shown in section [ s : symnormal ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised in the following way . in section [",
    "s : classical ] we recall the insertion rule of a letter into a tableau for the normal robinson - schensted algorithm ( with column insertion ) .",
    "we describe it in a way that suits the growth diagram . in section [ s : symnormal ]",
    "we describe the insertion rule for a word and state the symmetry property for the rs algorithm applied to permutations . in section [ s : qrs ] and",
    "[ s : wordqrs ] we describe the @xmath0-weighted insertion algorithm for letters and words in a way which is different , but equivalent to the definition given in @xcite . in section",
    "[ s : symq ] we state and prove the symmetry property in the @xmath0-case . finally in section",

    "evidently a tableau has only finitely many different @xmath33 s and there exists an @xmath20 such that @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",

    ". we can identify @xmath6 with these shapes and write @xmath37 , where `` @xmath38 '' is an interlacing relation : for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 means @xmath42 .",
    "for example the tableau @xmath6 in is identified as @xmath43    the basic operation of the robinson - schensted algorithm is to insert a letter @xmath44 into a tableau @xmath45 and produce a new tableau @xmath46 . to do this",
    "we first find the lowest row in @xmath47 such that appending a box at the end of that row would preserve the interlacement between the @xmath48th shape and the @xmath28th shape , and append the box to that row .",
    "suppose the row has index @xmath49 , then we find the lowest row in @xmath50 that is no lower than row @xmath49 such that appending a box at the end of that row would preserve the interlacement between the @xmath28th shape and the @xmath51th shape , and append the box to that row , and so on and so forth .",

    "one could check that this is indeed equivalent to the definition in the previous section .",
    "moreover , the transposition of the lattice diagram preserves the algorithm .",
    "that is : if we put @xmath69 s in boxes @xmath88 rather than @xmath89 , and label each vertex @xmath90 with what was labelled on @xmath91 , we end up with the configuration that is the same as if we apply the rules 1 through 5 .",

    "we describe the algorithm in a different way from the definition in @xcite . at the end of next section",
    "it is obvious to see that :    the algorithm described in this section for inserting a letter to a tableau and in the next section for inserting a word to an empty tableau is an equivalent reformulation of the @xmath0-weighted robinson - schensted algorithm defined in @xcite .    when inserting a letter to a tableau it outputs a weigted set of tableaux .",
    "to insert a @xmath28 into @xmath6 , we start with @xmath47 , append a box to different possible rows no lower than @xmath28 , record the index of rows , and for each one of these indices @xmath49 , we obtain a new @xmath28th shape @xmath92 with weight @xmath93 ; then we proceed to add a box to all possible rows in @xmath50 no lower than @xmath49 and obtain a weighted set of new @xmath51th shapes @xmath94 ; then for each @xmath95 we obtain the new @xmath96th shapes with weight @xmath97 by adding a box to @xmath98th row in @xmath99 and so on and so forth .",
    "we also prune all the 0-weighted branches .    this way we obtain a forest of trees whose roots are @xmath100 s , leaves are @xmath101 s with edges labeled by the weights .",
    "if we prepend @xmath102 to this forest we obtain a tree with root @xmath60 , the first @xmath28 levels each having one branch with one edge , which we label with weight 1 .",
    "then for each leaf @xmath101 we obtain a unique tableau by reading its genealogy .",
    "we also associate this tableau with a weight which is the product of weights along the edges . by going through all leaves",
    "we obtain a set of weighted tableaux , which is the output of @xmath0-inserting a @xmath28 to @xmath6 .",
    "now we describe how we calculate the weights when inserting a box to @xmath36th shape @xmath33 with a @xmath103 ( let @xmath104 ) specified .",

    "we also have @xmath123 , @xmath124 in this example .",
    "the above output tableau is @xmath125 with weight @xmath126 .",
    "for any two tableaux @xmath6 and @xmath53 we denote the weight of obtaining @xmath53 after inserting @xmath28 into @xmath6 by @xmath127 .",
    "so in the previous example we have @xmath128 .",
    "as we can see , each branching to obtain a weighted set of new @xmath36th shapes @xmath129 is determined by @xmath33 and @xmath103 , the latter in turn is identified by the pair @xmath130 . therefore the branching is determined by the triplet @xmath131 .",
    "while each @xmath132 , together with @xmath33 and @xmath133 determines a next branching .",
    "hence the tree has the structure illustrated in figure [ fig : branch ] ,     ( see section [ s : other ] , where the @xmath0-weighted algorithm is an example ) . ]",
    "where we put the weights on the edges .",
    "this way we can write the weights : @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 for @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the indicator function .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-insertion algorithm can be visualised in a `` one - column '' graph similar to the normal insertion .",
    "each node @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 ) representing the old @xmath36th shape ( or a new @xmath14th shape ) is associated with a vertex @xmath141 ( or @xmath142 ) as the northwest ( or northeast ) vertex of the @xmath36th ( or @xmath14th ) box .",

    "we define the @xmath0-row insertion for word input in the same way as @xmath0-column insertion of words : successively @xmath0-row inserting letters , multiplying the weights , keeping a tableau @xmath22 to record changes for each @xmath6 , and merging the same tableau pairs by adding up the weights . denote by @xmath353 the weight of obtaining tableau pair @xmath194 after @xmath0-row inserting a word @xmath195 .",

    "as such , it is more natural to compare the @xmath0-column insertion discussed in the previous sections with the @xmath0-row insertion , as we have pointed out the similarity of the relation between the @xmath0-column insertion and the @xmath0-row insertion and the relation between the normal column and row insertions",
