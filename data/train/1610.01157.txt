    "short duration gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) are expected to be associated with the merger of a compact binary system in which at least one of the two components is a neutron star ( ns ) , the other possibly being a black hole ( bh ; @xcite ) .",
    "binary ns mergers are also candidate sources of gravitational waves , similar to the binary bh mergers recently detected by ligo @xcite .",
    "while a sgrb is highly beamed and its detection against the gamma - ray background is possible only if its relativistic jet is pointing towards the earth , gravitational waves are only moderately aspherical and ns binary mergers are expected to be detectable irrespective of their orientation . for a typical sgrb jet opening angle of @xmath0 @xcite , the probability of detecting an on - axis burst",
    "is only @xmath1 per cent . in other words ,",
    "only one out of 10 ns binary mergers detected in gravitational waves ( gws ) will be accompanied by a full - fledged sgrb .",
    "other estimates put the average opening angle at @xmath2 @xcite , with a rate of only one on - axis burst every @xmath3 detected by ligo",
    ". the most likely orientation will be the one most difficult to observe in electromagnetic waves , i.e. , the edge - on configuration with the relativistic jet expanding perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "our hope of confirming the supposed association of sgrbs with ns binary mergers @xcite is therefore tied to our capability of modeling and detecting the off - axis emission of such events @xcite .",
    "while said emission is faint , compared to the burst of gamma rays from an on - axis jet , ligo only detects ns binary mergers within a relatively small distance form earth ( @xmath4  mpc ) , and even the faint off - axis sgrb components might be detectable .",
    "off - axis emission from relativistic jets in the external shock phase has been studied for long and short duration grbs , especially for the late afterglow phase @xcite . while such off - axis events have been searched in multi - wavelength surveys ,",
    "no credible candidate has emerged , so far @xcite .",
    "the case of gw - detected ns binary mergers would , however , be different .",
    "if a localization could be made for the direction to the gw event , searching for a transient in a small area of the sky would be much easier than blindly surveying a large region of the sky . detection of off - axis emission from sgrbs associated with gravitationally detected binary ns mergers could then become a powerful tool for studying the structure of the jet and of any non - relativistic or mildly relativistic ejecta associated with the merger and the burst .    in light of these considerations , we present in this paper a calculation of possible components of off - axis emission from a sgrb , including the de - beamed prompt emission , the emission associated with the jet cocoon @xcite , and the afterglow emission .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we present the theoretical framework at the base of our calculations , in section  3 we present our multi - wavelength results , and in section  4 we discuss the detectability of the signal for expected distances of ligo - detected ns binary mergers and the implications of a ( non)detection .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider a sgrb engine releasing a total energy @xmath5 in two counter - propagating jets .",
    "@xmath6 is the energy released in each jet .",
    "the engine is active for a time @xmath7 and the outflow is initially beamed in jets with an half - opening angle @xmath8 .",
    "the jets are released at rest ( @xmath9 ) at a distance @xmath10 from the center of the system with a ratio of internal energy to rest mass allowing for acceleration to a maximum lorentz factor @xmath11 .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy of the system is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the solid angle occupied by the two jets .",
    "the rest mass carried by the fireball is @xmath14 .",
    "we consider to counter - propagating `` top - hat '' jets , with uniform properties within their opening angle @xmath8 and with sharp edges .    guided by binary merger simulation results @xcite we assume that the jet is launched and initially propagates within a baryon contaminated environment .",
    "we assume the polluted region to be of size @xmath15 and to have uniform density @xmath16 . due to the very short interaction time with the expanding jet ,",
    "we neglect any expansion of the polluted region , which is predicted to be moving outward at non - relativistic ( nr ) speed .       and is located at a distance of 200  mpc from earth .",
    "three values of the lorentz factor are shown , as well as the isotropic cocoon contribution .",
    "the thin dashed line shows the result for a radially thin outflow that emits for a vanishingly small time .",
    "[ fig : prompt ] ]    the prompt emission of the sgrb jet is computed as follows .",
    "we assume that at a certain distance @xmath17 from the engine the internal energy of the outflow is converted into photons and radiated .",
    "the nature of the emission mechanism is not discussed here and is irrelevant for our conclusions .",
    "we assume that there are no relativistic internal motions .",
    "we also assume that the local dissipation rate in the outflow comoving frame is uniform within the jet opening angle and that the emitted radiation is isotropic in the local comoving frame .",
    "we first consider the peak bolometric luminosity @xmath18 , so that the details of the spectral shape of the prompt emission do not need to be discussed .",
    "its variation for observers along different lines of sight depends on the timing properties of the jet emission .",
    "we first consider the case in which the duration of the emission episode in the comoving frame is long enough that every observer sees emission from the entire outflow , at least at some time .",
    "under such conditions , the received bolometric flux is the result of the integration over the emitting surface of the local emission boosted by the doppler factor @xmath19^{-1}$ ] elevated to the fourth power ( one for the photon rate , one for the blueshift in the photon energy , and two for the beaming of the solid angle ) .",
    "the observed peak bolometric luminosity is therefore calculated as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis that points nearest to the observer , @xmath22 is the emitting surface , @xmath23 is the angle between the line of sight and the local velocity vector , @xmath24 is the angle between the local velocity vector and the jet axis , and @xmath25 is the peak luminosity seen by an on - axis observer .",
    "the results of the above integration for various values of @xmath26 are shown in figure  [ fig : prompt ] .",
    "the main lesson from the figure is that , for expected values of the fireball lorentz factor at the time of the prompt emission , the observed flux drops - off quite dramatically as soon as the line of sight moves out of the jet .",
    "we note that the assumptions above are quite optimistic .",
    "let us consider now the opposite assumption , i.e. , a jet in which the emission lasts for a negligibly small amount of time in the comoving frame .",
    "in this case each observer sees only a small region of the jet active at any time , and the peak flux is due solely to the region of the fireball closer to the line of sight .",
    "[ eq : prompt ] is replaced by the simpler : @xmath27 ^ 4 }                     & \\theta_{\\rm{obs}}>\\theta_j \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : promptthin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which decays even faster than the one from equation  [ eq : prompt ] for large off - axis angles ( see dashed lines in figure  [ fig : prompt ] ) .    for the calculation of the light curves in the radio , optical , x - ray , and swift bat band , instead",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "we assumed that the prompt emission has a band spectral shape with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and comoving peak frequency @xmath30  kev .",
    "we also assume that the emission of radiation turns on at the same radius @xmath17 for the entire fireball and lasts , in the comoving frame @xmath31  s. as seen from an on - axis observer ( @xmath32 ) and assuming @xmath33 , this burst has an observed peak photon energy @xmath34  kev and a duration @xmath35  s , fairly typical for observed sgrbs .",
    "the spectrum was normalized such that the on - axis observer would detect a bolometric isotropic equivalent energy @xmath36 erg .",
    "the prompt emission light curves in figures  [ fig : xray ] ,  [ fig : optical ] , and  [ fig : radio ] were computed via a monte carlo method .",
    "three million emission regions were generated with random propagation direction within the jet opening angle .",
    "each of them was turned on at the prescribed distance and given the band spectrum described above .",
    "the observed activation time of each emission region was calculated taking into account light propagation effects , and the observed light curve of each individual region was calculated by integrating the band spectrum in the comoving frequency band corresponding to the observed frequency range .",
    "all the emission regions were then coadded in the final light curves .",
    "we derive the energy that is transferred from the jet into the cocoon under the assumption that the jet head travels at a constant velocity .",
    "this allows us to write the energy of the cocoon as the luminosity of two jets , @xmath37 times the amount of time the jets spend in the ambient material , @xmath38 : @xmath39 .",
    "we can express @xmath38 as the distance the jet has to travel , @xmath15 , divided by the velocity of the jet head , @xmath40 , giving : @xmath41 which leaves the head velocity , @xmath40 , as the only quantity to derive .",
    "we consider two methods for deriving @xmath40 .",
    "the first @xcite assumes that the jet transversal size is obtained by equating the ram pressure of the jet material with the pressure of the cocoon .",
    "this method should therefore be appropriate for cocoon - confined jets , those for which the outflow velocity vector makes a significant angle with the jet - cocoon discontinuity .",
    "they first define the quantity ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath42 the ratio between the energy density of the jet and the energy density of the surrounding medium , where @xmath43 is the luminosity of the two jets and @xmath44 is the cross - sectional area of the jet at breakout . by making cylindrical approximations for the jet ,",
    "they show it is approximately    @xmath45    then , following @xcite , we find @xmath46 for the values considered in this paper ( see table  [ tab : symbols ] ) , @xmath47 and therefore @xmath48 therefore , with @xmath49 , the energy in the cocoon is @xmath50    using the values presented in table  [ tab : symbols ] , this gives an energy of @xmath51  erg",
    ".    an alternative derivation of @xmath40 can be obtained by balancing the jet thermal pressure and the cocoon pressure to compute the jet transversal size @xcite .",
    "this approximation holds for mildly confined jets , for which the ram pressure is negligible due to the fact that the relativistic outflow velocity is nearly parallel to the jet - cocoon discontinuity .",
    "they find : @xmath52 which gives a cocoon energy : @xmath53 which gives an energy of @xmath54  erg for the fiducial values reported in table  [ tab : symbols ] .",
    "the two results for the cocoon energy are fairly similar .",
    "not surprisingly , the second value gives a higher cocoon energy , since the jets are only mildly confined by the relatively low density of the merger ejecta . in the following we adopt a fiducial value @xmath55  erg for the cocoon energy .",
    "we note that the cocoon energy depends less than linearly on all jet and ejecta properties with the exception of the radius of the polluted region .",
    "should the ejecta be distributed in a larger region than the one assumed here , the cocoon energy would be significantly higher .",
    "let us now consider the subsequent evolution of the cocoon .",
    "at breakout , the cocoon is hot and high - pressured with no associated bulk motion . upon release",
    ", it accelerates quasi - isotropically @xcite .",
    "the fate and light curve produced by the cocoon depend critically on the contamination from the ambient material .",
    "numerical simulations of long grb jets show that the cocoon is polluted by the progenitor material in such a way that it has an asymptotic lorentz factor @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt a value @xmath57 in the remainder of this study , but we warn the reader that dedicated numerical simulations should be performed to pin down the actual composition of sgrb cocoons .    initially , the cocoon fireball accelerates self similarly , @xmath58 , until the saturation radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath59 beyond the saturation radius the cocoon fireball coasts at constant lorentz factor , releasing the advected radiation at the photospheric radius @xcite : @xmath60 which is , for the parameter choices of table  [ tab : symbols ] , beyond the saturation radius @xmath61 .",
    "the observed cocoon temperature is constant during the acceleration phase , and scales as @xmath62 in the coasting phase , yielding a photospheric temperature : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the initial temperature of the cocoon , @xmath65 is the radiation constant and @xmath66 is the cocoon volume at breakout time . following lazzati & begelman ( 2005 )",
    "we find : @xmath67 yielding an observed cocoon photospheric temperature : @xmath68 adopting the fiducial sgrb values from table  [ tab : symbols ] and the jet head velocity from either equation  [ eq : betahv1 ] or  [ eq : betahv2 ] we find @xmath69  kev , the value that we adopt for the light curves calculations .",
    "assuming that the radiated spectrum is a black body we obtain a luminosity : @xmath70 where we have used equations  [ eq : rph ] and  [ eq : t0 ] for the final result .",
    "for the typical sgrb values adopted above , we have : @xmath71    the emission would last for the longest time between the diffusion time in the cocoon shell @xmath72 and the angular time scale @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath57 the latter dominates and the cocoon thermal pulse would last @xmath74  s. note that multiplying the photospheric luminosity times the pulse duration we obtain a photospheric radiative energy that is comparable ( within a factor of order unity ) to the cocoon energy , as expected .    the cocoon light curves for the cocoon photospheric emission shown in figures  [ fig : xray ] ,  [ fig : optical ] , and  [ fig : radio ] were computed via the same monte carlo method discussed for the prompt emission .",
    "the comoving spectrum , however , was assumed to be thermal with temperature @xmath75  kev .",
    "the afterglow emission of the jet and cocoon components are calculated using the semi - analytic trans - relativistic afterglow code ( trac ) , identical to that used in @xcite ( full description will be published in morsony et al . in preparation ) .",
    "trac is able to model the emission of a relativistic fireball with an arbitrary energy distribution , as seen by an observer at any angle relative to the jet axis .",
    "we assume all afterglow emission is produced by synchrotron radiation , including synchrotron self - absorption and local synchrotron cooling .",
    "for all models presented here , synchrotron radiation is parameterized by @xmath76 , the fraction of energy in electrons , @xmath77 , the fraction of energy in the magnetic field , and @xmath78 , the spectral index of the electron energy distribution .",
    "we model the jet and cocoon as expanding into a constant density external medium ( ism ) with number density of @xmath79  @xmath80 .",
    "the cocoon component is modeled as a spherical explosion with kinetic energy of @xmath81  erg and initial lorentz factor of @xmath82 .",
    "the jet is modeled as a top - hat jet with isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of @xmath83  erg and initial lorentz factor @xmath84 within an half opening angle @xmath85 and no material outside the jet .",
    "figures  [ fig : xray ] ,  [ fig : optical ] , and  [ fig : radio ] summarize the results of our calculations .",
    "the three figures show how a burst with the properties listed in table  [ tab : symbols ] and located at 200 mpc from earth would be observed in x - rays , optical , and radio bands , respectively .",
    "each figure has five panels , each panel showing the observations that would be performed by an observer located along a particular line of sight . from left to right and top to bottom",
    ", observers at 0 , 20 , 40 , 60 , and 90 degrees from the jet axis are shown .",
    "along with the predicted fluxes and flux densities , we show the detection limit of instruments that could be used to search for the electromagnetic counterpart of the gw event . in x - ray ,",
    "we consider swift xrt and chandra . for late xrt observations we assume a detection limit of @xmath86 erg  @xmath87  s@xmath88 ( for a 10  ks exposure ) . for early xrt observations , we assume a detection limit that scales with the square root of the exposure time , assuming that the signal to noise is background dominates . a constant detection limit of @xmath89 erg  @xmath87  s@xmath88 is adopted for chandra , corresponding to a @xmath90  ks exposure .",
    "we also assumed that swift can repoint xrt to the burst location within one minute , while it takes chandra one day to repoint . in the optical we show r - band imaging detection limits for an 8 meter class telescope and for hst , r=26 and 27 , respectively .",
    "finally , in the radio , we report a vla detection limit of 10  @xmath91jy , assuming a 10 hours reaction time .",
    "we have calculated the on- and off - axis emission of a typical short grb .",
    "our calculations include the prompt and afterglow emission from the relativistic jet material as well as the prompt and afterglow emission from the cocoon material .",
    "an energetic cocoon is expected to form as the sgrb relativistic jet propagates through the immediate surroundings of the ns binary merger , polluted with @xmath92  m@xmath93 of material tidally ejected from the merging compact objects @xcite .",
    "we calculated the energy of the cocoon and find it to amount to approximately @xmath94 per cent of the burst energy and to be a strong function of the size of the high - density region surrounding the merger site .",
    "as reported in figures  [ fig : xray ] ,  [ fig : optical ] , and  [ fig : radio ] , the emission from the relativistic jet ( both prompt and afterglow ) dominate at all times and at all wavelengths for the on - axis observer .",
    "however , as discussed above , the most likely observer angles are large , half of the events been observed at 35 degrees or more . in such cases ( the last three panels of figures  [ fig : xray ] ,  [ fig : optical ] , and  [ fig : radio ] ) the jet emission is undetectable with current instrumentation , with the exception of the radio band , in which a 100  @xmath91jy source would be detectable approximately one year after the gw detection",
    ". a faint optical transient peaking @xmath95  months after the gw trigger would also be detectable for observers at @xmath96 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the emission from an off - axis jet is dramatically reduced by relativistic beaming ( see figure  [ fig : prompt ] ) , and the jet emission is detected only after the jet has slowed down to trans - relativistic speed , about one year after the merger .",
    "the cocoon afterglow , instead , is isotropic and peaks at a few hours ( x - rays and optical ) to a few days ( radio ) after the merger . at peak time , and for a few days to a few weeks , it is faint but clearly detectable by current instrumentation . we therefore conclude that , should a gw detected ns binary merger be promptly localized , rapid follow up would be able to detect the cocoon afterglow emission and allow for the identification of the electromagnetic counterpart of the gw source . besides being brighter , the cocoon emission is detectable just a few hours after the gw signal , greatly reducing the likelihood of a false detection triggered by an unrelated transient within the error radius of the gw source .",
    "the cocoon also produces a short ( @xmath74  s ) pulse of prompt emission with a broadened thermal spectrum . according to our calculations ,",
    "the cocoon prompt emission is just above the detection threshold of both the swift bat and the fermi gbm .",
    "the actual detectability of the cocoon prompt emission is , however , uncertain , since the spectrum is thermal at a temperature that is at the edge of the instruments sensitivity .",
    "additional work in necessary to better tease out the properties of the cocoon prompt emission and the chance of detecting it with current instrumentation .",
    "our calculations are based on a set of simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the relativistic outflow is a top - hat jet , with a sharp edge in which the lorentz factor drops from 100 to 1 with no boundary layer .",
    "we also assume that the cocoon is perfectly isotropic , and that some degree of mixing with the ambient medium causes the entropy of the cocoon to be lower than the one of the jet material .",
    "while these assumption allow us to perform the calculations using semi - analytical techniques , they might overemphasize the differences between the on - axis and off - axis observers . for example",
    ", a jet with a transition layer with lower lorentz factor would produce a smoother decline of the prompt emission with observer angle ( compared to the dramatic decrease seen in figure  [ fig : prompt ] ) .",
    "in addition , a cocoon that maintains some degree of asymmetry would be dimmer  and therefore harder to detect  for a binary merger with a very large viewing angle . numerical simulations need to be adopted to correctly represent the ambient medium and self - consistently predict the jet structure and the cocoon structure and degree of mixing with the ambient medium .",
    "we also should note that we neglect the emission from a kilonova ( also known as a macronova ) , possibly associated with the merger @xcite .",
    "the kilonova emission is isotropic and should be sufficiently bright in the optical and ir bands ( @xmath97 at 200 mpc ) and peak at @xmath98  week after the merger .",
    "it would therefore be identified easily from the cocoon and jet afterglows that peak on time scales of a few hours and a few months ( for a large angle observer ) . a kilonova precursor peaking @xmath98  hour after the merger has also been discussed @xcite , possibly outshining the cocoon afterglow component at early time .    to conclude",
    ", we would like to point out the opportunity given by the follow - up of gw detected binary merger to pin down the jet structure of sgrbs .",
    "when a large sample of gw detected ns binary mergers will be available , comparing the brightness of their electromagnetic counterparts could allow us to map the polar distribution of the jet energy , velocity , and possibly magnetization .",
    "this would be an extremely important constrain for jet acceleration models that is impossible to obtain from long - duration grbs .",
