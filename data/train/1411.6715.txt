    "the nature of flat bands has been attracting much attention from a variety of view points .",

    "however , the mechanism to realize such ubiquitous flat bands has not been clarified yet .    in this paper , we reveal the origin of the flat bands in @xmath0co@xmath1 compounds and attribute their existence to the localized eigenstates realized by the destructive interference  @xcite of the inter - site hopping among co-3@xmath11 orbitals on the kagom - honeycomb stacked structure .",
    "these flat bands are affected very little by varying the lattice parameters while their relative positions to the other bands are altered . such robustness and controllability of the flat bands",

    "although similar investigation using a small variation such as about 1% for @xmath94 was performed in previous studies  @xcite , it is surprising that the flat dispersion is almost completely retained by such large variation of the lattice parameters .",

    "in summary , we found that the realization of the flat bands in @xmath0co@xmath1 compounds can be attributed to the existence of the localized eigenstate defined in particular directions .",
    "because the localized eigenstate for the @xmath8 flat band has an overlap with the neighboring localized eigenstate ( i.e. , that translated with respect to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions ) , the existence of the @xmath8 flat band can contribute to the in - plane ferromagnetic correlation  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that the non - trivial destructive interference is observed on the structure of the kagom - honeycomb network that can be constructed as a line graph  @xcite of the hexagonal prism .",
    "their flat dispersion is very robust against the variation of the lattice parameters whereas their relative position to the other bands and the fermi level can be controlled by it , which offers the possibility of flat - band engineering .      999 e. h. lieb , phys .",
