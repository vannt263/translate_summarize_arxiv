    "there have been a number of publications analyzing citation patterns in the astronomical literature , see my previous paper for more discussion ( stanek 2008 ) . in that paper",
    "i addressed the question of whether longer astronomical papers are cited more ( they are ) . following a number of suggestions i received after posting that seminal study , here i address the question of whether astronomical papers with more authors are also cited more .",
    "that this would be the case is somewhat expected , for a number of reasons , but the expected size of the effect varied quite widely among my informally polled colleagues .",
    "i therefore decided to investigate the citation vs.  number of authors correlation for astronomical papers , and i found the results interesting enough to warrant this posting . in section 2",
    "i describe the data , namely citation and number of authors statistics for about 30,000 refereed astronomical papers published between 2000 and 2004 in apj , a&a , aj and mnras . in section 3",
    "i discuss the results , and in section 4 i conclude with some brief remarks .",
    "i used the ads abstract serviceservice.html ] to obtain the citations , page length and number of authors for all papers published between 2000 and 2004 ( i.e. , five complete years ) in the four largest astronomical journals , a&a , aj , apj and mnras .",
    "i start in 2000 so that page lengths will be reported for all papers and end with 2004 to allow significant time for papers to mature ( or not ) and obtain citations .",
    "the journals were chosen so there would be plenty of papers for statistics , with the page length being about the same for each journal .",
    "there were 12,854 apj ( including apjl and apjs ) papers , 9,275 a&a papers , 5,328 mnras papers and 2,564 aj papers , for a total of 30,021 papers .",
    "originally , that number was somewhat larger , but i have removed all one - page papers from the list , as these were mostly errata or editorials , usually cited 0 times .",
    "i procured these data using ads in mid - november 2009 .",
    "as this is the same sample of papers i have used in my previous study ( stanek 2008 ) , but previously with citations accumulated until june 2008 , i will also discuss briefly the growth of citations for the whole sample between the two studies .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "i show the basic properties of our sample , such as the distribution of number of authors ( fig.@xmath11 ) and the distribution of citations ( fig.@xmath12 )",
    ". while the distributions presented in fig.@xmath11 are more or less the same , except for aj having a larger fraction of papers with more authors , the distributions presented in fig.@xmath12 are not identical in shape .",
    "the median number of authors per paper for the entire sample of @xmath2 papers is 3 , with a mode of 2 authors , and only @xmath3 papers with 50 or more authors . in the distribution of citations , @xmath4 papers in the sample",
    "have 3 or fewer citations , while @xmath5 papers have 100 or more citations , and only @xmath6 papers have 1,000 or more citations .",
    "th median number of citations for the entire sample grew from 15 in june 2008 ( stanek 2008 ) to 19 in november 2009 .",
    "i have not tried in any way to correct for or to remove self - citations .",
    "having the number of authors and the number of citations , i can produce a citation - authors diagram ( hereafter : cad ) , which i present in fig.@xmath13 . for display purposes ,",
    "i have added @xmath7 to the number of citations for each paper ( `` an honorary citation '' ) , to avoid the @xmath8 problem .",
    "also , for display purposes , i add a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 0.9 to both @xmath9 and the number of citations , otherwise all papers with the same number of authors and citations would produce only one dot in the cad .    for bins of journals articles with a given number of authors ,",
    "the median number of citations is shown by large open circles . as can be seen from our cad",
    ", these medians clearly increase with the number of authors , and range from 12 for articles with 1 author to about 50 for articles with 50 and more authors .",
    "one obvious thing to notice is that , as expected , for any given number of authors on a paper there is a very wide range in the number of citations , as seen by the 10% and 90% ranges ( filled blue dots ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , barring any ads errors , there seem to exist papers with very many authors and very few citations .    since i have already shown ( stanek 2008 ) that longer papers are cited more ( again , in the median sense , and as always with a large dispersion in number of citations )",
    ", maybe what we are seeing in fig.@xmath103 is simply that having more authors also means writing more pages ? however , as can be seen in fig.@xmath104 , that is definitely not the case , in fact the median number of pages does not seem to depend at all on the number of authors and it is always from 8 to 10 pages .",
    "additional authors clearly do not seem to be actually contributing much in terms of additional paper length , but they are clearly adding ( logarithmically ) to a paper s impact",
    ". this additional impact could be simply due to more self - citations , but that is only a guess , which i have not investigated here .",
    "finally , in fig@xmath105 i plot the cumulative distributions of the fraction of the total citations vs. number of authors for each of the four journals .",
    "the curves for apj , a&a and mnras are rather similar , while the cumulative curve for aj is significantly different , meaning papers with more authors contribute a significantly larger fraction of total citations for aj vs. the other journals .",
    "i will let the reader amuse herself / himself by speculating on or investigating the possible reasons for this difference .",
    "in stanek ( 2008 ) i concluded with some semi - humorous publishing advice , directed especially towards first - year graduate students .",
    "i stand by that advice , also because of the mostly positive feedback i have received after posting that study : `` i enjoyed your well written article about citations and the length of papers .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the longest of the @xmath11n00 papers that i have written was often cited , but not much read .",
    "so perhaps one should look for ways to try to measure the impact of a paper rather than the number of times it is cited - clearly a difficult task . perhaps the truly great papers are the ones that still get cited after many decades .",
    "it is a bit frightening to note that zwicky s great paper on the discovery of dark matter only started to get cited a quarter of a century after it was written . '' ; `` i wanted to say that i read your paper and really enjoyed it .",
    "in particular , the last section where you gave ` semi - humorous ' advice .",
    "that was the best advice i ve heard in a long time ! '' ;  brilliant astro - ph submission !",
    "i think this will be a mandatory read for any students that want to go on to grad school. ; `` thanks for your insightful and very funny paper on astro - ph .",
    "it made my morning . '' ; but also `` cute paper on astro - ph today , but do nt you find this whole series of meta - papers to be rather cynical ?",
    "you call the advice to first - year graduate students like myself ` semi - humorous , ' but the message seems to be telling us how to game the system . ''",
    "i do not have enough new semi - humorous material to put in this paper , but if you send me something funny and relevant , i might add you and the advice to the paper , and perhaps together we will be cited more ( logarithmically speaking ) .",
    "it would perhaps be of some interest to investigate how the effect found in this paper changes with time , and more generally if the statistics of number of authors has evolved in the last few decades .",
    "this might or might not be a subject of a future study .",
    "i thank hsiao - wen chen and chris kochanek for suggesting this particular line of inquiry .",
    "i also thank chris kochanek for locating all these `` the ' 's and `` a ' 's that i have lost , misplaced or applied randomly .",
    "i thank the people whose e - mails i am quoting ( i will keep them anonymous ) .",
    "the data and plots presented in this paper are real , despite the ( mostly intended ) humorous style of writing .",
    "this paper will not be submitted to any journal ."

    "<S> following my previous study of paper length vs. number of citations in astronomy ( stanek 2008 ) , some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an astronomical paper . </S>",
    "<S> at least naively , one would expect papers with more authors to be cited more . </S>",
    "<S> i test this expectation with the same sample of papers as analyzed in stanek ( 2008 ) , selecting all ( @xmath0 ) refereed papers from a&a , aj , apj and mnras published between 2000 and 2004 . these particular years </S>",
    "<S> were chosen so that the papers analyzed would not be too `` fresh '' , but number of authors and length of each article could be obtained via ads .    </S>",
    "<S> i find that indeed papers with more authors published in these four major astronomy journals are on average cited more , but only weakly so : roughly , the number of citations doubles with ten - fold increase in the number of authors . </S>",
    "<S> while the median number of citations for a 2 author paper is 17 , the median number of citations to a paper with 10 to 20 authors is 32 . </S>",
    "<S> however , i find that most papers are written by a small number of authors , with a mode of 2 authors and a median of 3 authors , and 92% of all papers written have fewer than 10 authors . perhaps surprisingly </S>",
    "<S> , i also find that papers with more authors are not longer than papers with fewer authors , in fact a median number of 8 to 10 pages per paper holds for any number of authors . </S>",
    "<S> for the same sample of papers , a median number of citations per paper grew from 15 in june 2008 ( stanek 2008 ) to 19 in november 2009 . unlike stanek ( 2008 ) </S>",
    "<S> , i do not conclude with any career advice , semi - humorous or otherwise . </S>"
