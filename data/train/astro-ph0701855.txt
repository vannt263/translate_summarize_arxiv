    "the @xmath2-ray lightcurve of grb  051109b shows a single soft peak , without a strong emission above 100  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , left panel ) .",
    "the estimated duration in the 15350  kev energy band is t@xmath3=15@xmath41  s @xcite .",
    "a faint afterglow was detected by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xmath086 s after the burst and monitored for the following 6 days .",
    "although the burst location was promptly observed by ground - based telescopes ( e.g. at t+52  s by the rotse - iiib telescope ) @xcite and by the uvot ( at t+84  s ) @xcite , no optical counterpart was detected .",
    "a nearby ( z=0.08 ) barred spiral galaxy has been proposed by @xcite as the putative host galaxy .",
    "the field of grb  051109b  was then re - observed by swift on aug 2006 but no late - time x - ray emission was seen in the 17  ks exposure pc image with a 3@xmath5 upper limit of 9.8@xmath610@xmath7ctss@xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : lc ]",
    "the time  averaged spectrum of the prompt emission is well fit by a simple power law with a photon index of 1.9@xmath40.3 . a cut  off powerlaw or a band model",
    "do not improve significantly the fit , however fixing the first index @xmath9 of the band function @xmath10 , we put an upper limit to the e@xmath11 energy of 70  kev at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the fluence in the 15150  kev energy band is @xmath02.1@xmath610@xmath12erg@xmath13 and , using the redshift value of 0.08 , we put a lower limit of @xmath03@xmath610@xmath14erg to the isotropic energy . extrapolating the power law model in the whole 1 - 10@xmath15  kev ( rest frame ) band we computed an upper limit of e@xmath161.3@xmath610@xmath17erg .",
    "the average xrt spectrum can be modeled with an absorbed power law of @xmath18 @xmath13 and a photon index @xmath19=@xmath20 .",
    "the fluence emitted by the afterglow in the x - ray band is @xmath03.5@xmath610@xmath12erg@xmath13 , comparable to that of the prompt emission .",
    "the combined bat and xrt lightcurve , shown in fig.[fig : lc ] , displays many of the features seen by swift for other grbs .",
    "the x - ray hardness ratio ( fig.[fig : lc ] ) shows a spectral evolution between the three standard phases of the afterglow emission , in particular a hardening related to the small flare peaking at @xmath0t+1500  s. from spectral and timing analysis we derived a spectral index @xmath21 of the radiating electrons of @xmath02.1 for @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "due to the narrow energy band of the swift bat , it is hard to costrain low peak energy values , however the soft spectral index of the prompt emission suggest grb  051109b can be identified as a xrr burst .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve has a well known shape : an initial fast decay in the first 200  s , interpreted as off - axis prompt emission ; a plateau , attributed to energy injection into the afterglow ; a final decay of index @xmath01 in agreement with standard afterglow models .",
    "using our best fit model and the data reported in @xcite , corrected for extinction , we found f@xmath25@xmath03.7@xmath610@xmath26erg@xmath13s@xmath8 and a f@xmath27@xmath011 @xmath28jy at t+11  hr . we verified that grb  051109b lies well above the region of dark bursts defined in @xcite ."
