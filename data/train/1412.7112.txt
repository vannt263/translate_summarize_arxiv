    "no lorentz boost can turn alice into bob .",
    "observers in different reference frames thus should agree on which branch is alice s and which is bob s , and when a particle travels down a branch they should also agree on which branch was traversed . as such , the transformations done by alice and bob that alter these lorentz - invariant statistics must also appear the same in every reference frame .",

    "this is particularly problematic for a space - like separation between alice and bob : consider again the two observers rachael and steven , moving at relativistic speed relative to each other , as in figure  [ fig : minkowski ] .",
    "although rachael and steven must agree what effect either action @xmath3 or @xmath4 would have on the interferometer individually ( from the lorentz invariance of transformations ) , they could in general disagree about the order in which the two events occur  @xcite .    in particular ,",

    "the two material interferometer arms break manifest lorentz invariance , and all observers see the same transformations @xmath3 and @xmath4 . on the other hand , the local choices or applications of the transformations @xmath3 and",

    "* further discussion of assumption ( i).* let us first discuss a situation where assumption ( i ) does _ not _ hold , and then argue why it should hold in our two - armed interferometer .",
    "imagine a situation where we have a single particle on four interferometer arms , and two of the arms ( say , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) are held by alice , whereas the other two arms ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) are held by bob .",
    "we can think of a `` which - party''-measurement , that determines whether the particle is at alice s or bob s location .    consider a unitary @xmath122 that acts non - trivially only on the subspace spanned by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this is a phase transformation for the `` which - party''-measurement .",
    "it can map @xmath118 onto an arbitrary superposition @xmath123 , and @xmath119 onto an arbitrary orthogonal state in the subspace , while leaving @xmath120 and @xmath121 invariant .",
    "this unitary does not alter the probability of finding the particle in alice s set of branches .",
    "clearly , @xmath122 is a phase transformation that is locally available to alice , but not to bob ( this can be verified by arguments of _ branch locality _  @xcite , as @xmath122 will have no observable effect on the output statistics for states that have no support in @xmath118 or @xmath119 ) . thus , we expect that the map @xmath124 is an element of @xmath52 ( but not of @xmath53 ) . there is another operational argument for this : suppose that alice decides to either apply @xmath122 , or not to apply it .",
    "after this , she determines whether the particle is found in her half of the interferometer ( by performing a `` which - party''-measurement ) .",
    "if she finds the particle in her half , then some properties of the particle will depend on whether she has applied @xmath122 before or not .",
    "in other words , _ applying @xmath122 has a locally detectable consequence on outcomes of measurements _ ( conditional on finding the particle there ) .",
    "these consequences are observable by alice , but not by bob .",
    "this is the physical origin of the fact that @xmath125 and @xmath126  the mechanism that locates this transformation at @xmath50 , but not at @xmath51 .    in our setting",
    ", however , no localization mechanism of this kind is possible : whenever alice or bob perform a `` which - party''-measurement ( which is just a `` which - path''-measurement ) , the state will collapse either to @xmath76 or to @xmath127 , independently of any phase transformations that may have been applied before . thus , there is no physical basis of locating some transformations @xmath128 either at @xmath50 or at @xmath51 . unless there is an additional mechanism that breaks the symmetry between alice and bob , we should expect to have @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of  @xcite , in which branch locality in general provides a mechanism for breaking the symmetry of phase operations between branches by explicitly identifying whether a particular transformation can be done on any particular branch . for two - level state spaces with an uncertainty principle ( such as @xmath8-balls ) , it was found that branch locality does not break the symmetry between alice and bob .",
    "the argument above takes this a step further , by noting that _ no mechanism _ for breaking the symmetry between branches of an interferometer will have an observable effect on a two - level system subject to an uncertainty principle .    note",
    "that @xmath71 is a stronger statement than just saying that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are isomorphic : it says that _ every action that can locally be performed by alice can in principle also be locally performed by bob_. in a standard quantum mach - zehnder interferometer , this is indeed the case : inserting a phase plate of angle @xmath129 into alice s arm is completely equivalent to inserting a phase plate of angle @xmath130 into bob s arm .",
    "we can also understand this property as saying that these transformations are _ fully relational _ : they have no locally detectable consequences whatsoever , but they alter the relation between the two interferometer arms ( such as their relative optical path lengths ) .",
    "thus , one would expect that either _ both alice and bob _ are able to trigger such a change of relation between the arms ( by applying a suitable transformation ) , or neither of them are .",
    "this amounts to @xmath71 .",
    "* further discussion of assumption ( ii).* suppose that the smallest group that contains both @xmath52 and @xmath53 , call it @xmath75 , is a proper subgroup of all phase transformations @xmath70",
    ". we will restrict our discussion to the case that @xmath75 is connected ( and non - trivial ) , which is motivated by the continuity of time evolution . in this case",
    ", we can also assume that @xmath70 is connected , since all transformations in @xmath70 which are not connected to the identity will then not have any significance for the interference experiment .",
    "first consider the case that @xmath70 is a simple lie group  that is , it is connected , non - abelian , and every closed connected normal subgroup is either @xmath131 or all of @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that either @xmath70 is trivial ( in which case there are no local operations on the interferometer arms whatsoever ) , or that @xmath75 is not a normal subgroup . in the latter case , there are many `` copies '' of @xmath75 inside of @xmath70 , namely @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "but then , one should ask _ which physical mechanism selects the actual subgroup @xmath75 from this infinitude of possibilities ? _ in other words : the proper selection of subgroup is an additional choice to be made ; some element of the physical setup ( i.e.  the beam - splitter ) has to break the symmetry and perform this choice .",
    "now consider the case that @xmath70 is _ not _ a simple lie group .",
    "considering all the possible phase groups  @xcite starting with a group @xmath72 that is transitive on the sphere , we end up with only one non - simple possibility : that @xmath93 , which is the phase group for bloch ball dimension @xmath46  that is , the quaternionic quantum bit . in this case",
    ", the argument above can be avoided if @xmath75 is a non - trivial normal subgroup of @xmath70 .",
    "there are exactly two groups of this kind  @xcite , both isomorphic to @xmath95 , which is due to the double cover @xmath134 .",
    "since we should expect @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be at least _ isomorphic _ as groups , it is easy to see that there is no way to choose them as subgroups of @xmath95 such that @xmath135=0 $ ] and such that @xmath95 is generated from the union of both groups",
    ". thus , @xmath136 does not work , and we obtain the same conclusion as above also in this special case of the quaternionic qubit : @xmath52 and @xmath53 should generate all of @xmath70 .",

    "the @xmath139-dimensional @xmath72 consists of those maps for @xmath144 .",
    "this is the same group @xmath86 that also acts on the pure states in standard complex quantum theory ; however , the group actions are different in the way they affect the outcome probabilities of measurements .",
    "it is easy to compute the phase group preserving the vector @xmath145 , resulting in the set of maps of the form @xmath146 as one can see , these maps leave the @xmath147-subspace invariant , and behave in the @xmath148-subspace exactly in the same way as phase plates on a standard complex quantum bit .",
    "* @xmath149 case of theorem 2.* suppose we relax assumption ( i ) that @xmath99 , and instead impose assumption ( i * ) that @xmath52 and @xmath53 may be distinct groups but they should still be isomorphic .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath150 is a normal subgroup of @xmath70 , and @xmath151 , thus @xmath152 is non - trivial .",
    "if @xmath153 , then we have found a non - trivial normal subgroup of @xmath70 .",

    "thus , the connected component of @xmath159 at the identity , @xmath160 , is non - trivial .",
    "since it is a characteristic subgroup of @xmath159 , and @xmath159 is a normal subgroup of @xmath70 , the group @xmath160 is a normal ( proper non - trivial connected ) subgroup of @xmath70  @xcite .",

    "<S> [ details of @xmath97 are given in the technical appendix . ]    in addition to the @xmath28 case of standard complex quantum theory , there are now three more exotic possibilities that are consistent with relativity of simultaneity .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 case encounters problems with continuous time evolution , since it is not connected ( as discussed above ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath90 case is more interesting and quite unexpected . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently appeared in totally different context in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this group will act on a three - dimensional subspace of the sphere in the same way as phase plates on a standard complex quantum bit ( see appendix for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the group of transformations that can be applied locally on the interferometer arms is isomorphic to the group of standard qubit transformations , which suggests that this theory would behave very similarly to the standard quantum bit for experiments of this kind .    for @xmath46 , the transformation groups @xmath52 and @xmath53 are merely isomorphic ( for @xmath98 , the strong assumption ( i ) is obeyed such that @xmath99 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two groups in this case can be explicitly constructed  @xcite by considering the quaternionic phase matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 , with unit quaternions @xmath102 , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the only elements in common between the two branches are @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is some non - trivial interference behaviour , but unlike complex quantum theory , an arbitrary phase induced on one branch can not in general be cancelled out by an operation on the other . </S>",
    "<S> this would amount to a `` non - relational '' physics which is completely different to the other cases , and which could be falsified by an experiment in where one incrementally changes the phase plate on one branch ( altering the output statistics ) , and then finds a suitable transformation on the second branch that cancels out this change .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion.* we have shown that within a natural family of generalisations of quantum theory , the quantum case is singled out by essentially demanding relativity of simultaneity . is quantum theory the only probabilistic theory consistent with relativistic spacetime , or more concretely is the quantum path integral rule for summing up complex phases a direct consequence of the structure of spacetime ? </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest this may well be the case . </S>",
    "<S> however , a more detailed analysis would have to look at more involved physical situations , in particular interferometers with more than two arms .    </S>",
    "<S> given the results above , it seems particularly tempting to test experimentally for a @xmath90 bloch ball , which has one degree of freedom more than the standard complex quantum bit , but still one less than the quaternionic quantum bit ( @xmath46 ) . while peres proposal is in principle suitable to test for this , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the actual experimental implementation has to be chosen very carefully : as long as the state space will be probed only by applying different , spatially separated phase plates on identical input states ( which has been proposed for some setups  @xcite ) , relativity of simultaneity is likely to prevent any detectable difference in behaviour to the standard complex quantum bit .    </S>",
