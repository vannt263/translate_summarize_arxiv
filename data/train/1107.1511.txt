    "the choice of @xmath8 , which leads to the kuramoto model @xcite , is well motivated because the expansion of several coupled oscillators about a hopf bifurcation generically leads to sinusoidal coupling .",

    "if there are higher harmonics in @xmath6 , but the sinusoidal term is dominant , there is a transition to synchrony as in the kuramoto model as the coupling between the oscillators increases @xcite . in this case , the synchronous state is characterized by the phases of a large fraction of the oscillators clustering around a common phase . when higher harmonic terms are dominant , however , the synchronous state is characterized by the formation of multiple synchronized groups ( or `` clusters '' ) of oscillators , each with a common phase @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has also been called multibranch entrainment in previous work @xcite .",
