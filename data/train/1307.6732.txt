    "compton scattering by relativistic electrons is a very common astrophysical process .",
    "electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies in shocks or reconnection in a variety of cosmic sources , e.g. , jets , colliding winds in binaries , supernova remnants , or coronae of accreting sources .",
    "relativistic electrons are also a component of cosmic rays .",
    "the seed photons are often blackbody , usually from either the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or stars .",
    "the blackbody field is anisotropic if it comes from a star or isotropic , e.g. , in the cmb . some sites where this process takes place are listed below .",
    "black - hole x - ray binaries in some of their states have jets , which contain relativistic electrons .",
    "in the case of binaries with massive donors , e.g. , cyg x-1 or cyg x-3 , the electrons significantly compton up - scatter stellar radiation ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the blackbody radiation field coming from the surface of the donor star arriving at the jet is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the probability of scattering is highest for head - on collisions , and relativistic electrons radiate in a beam along their direction .",
    "this leads to a pronounced anisotropy of the compton - scattered radiation , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , with the observed compton flux peaking around the superior conjunction . assuming the star to be a point source , calculations of the phase - averaged jet emission require 4-dimensional integration , over the electron and photon distributions , the jet length and the orbital phase . taking into account",
    "the finite size of the star adds two more dimensions to the integration .",
    "the distribution of the relativistic electrons is , in general , not a power law , in particular when energy losses and a high - energy cut - off are considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then compton rates averaged over power law electrons can not be used .",
    "such calculations are thus very computationally intensive , and integrating analytically the compton rate over the blackbody distribution significantly facilitates them .",
    "the same compton anisotropy takes place in binary systems with pulsar wind colliding with wind of a massive star , so called @xmath0-ray binaries ( see @xcite for a review ) . in those systems ,",
    "interaction of the two winds leads to acceleration of relativistic electrons , which then radiate , in particular compton up - scatter blackbody photons from the massive star . that radiation will then be orbitally modulated , e.g. , in psr b125963 , ls i + 61@xmath1 303 and ls 5039 @xcite .    related systems are so - called colliding wind binaries , comprising of two massive stars with interacting winds",
    "electrons are accelerated in the interaction region , and compton up - scatter the stellar radiation .",
    "such emission appears to be observed from @xmath2 car @xcite .    in the case of pulsar winds ,",
    "stellar photons may also be compton up - scattered by cold electrons in the wind , which is ultra - relativistic and can have the bulk lorentz factor as high as @xmath3 .",
    "this process takes place in @xmath0-ray binaries @xcite , but it appears to be seen also in systems with pulsars with low - mass companions , e.g. , psr b1957 + 20 , the black widow pulsar @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "both the electron distribution and the blackbody radiation from the star are anisotropic .",
    "a related process is compton up - scattering by relativistic bulk motion of electrons in a jet , considered by @xcite .",
    "another astrophysical case of anisotropic compton scattering is that of cosmic - ray electrons and the interstellar starlight , which contributes to the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "that starlight field is dominated by stars in the galactic plane , and thus it is anisotropic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cosmic - ray electrons in the solar system compton up - scatter ( anisotropic ) solar radiation , which gives rise to emission of @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "( a software package for compton scattering by relativistic electrons off stellar emission is given by @xcite . )",
    "cosmic - ray electrons in the galaxy also up - scatter the isotropic cmb , contributing to x - ray and @xmath0-ray backgrounds , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this process also takes place in other galaxies , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then , compton up - scattering by relativistic electrons of both cmb and starlight takes place in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "usually the starlight field is approximated as isotropic .",
    "here we study both anisotropic and isotropic scattering .",
    "we integrate the corresponding rates of compton scattering by mono - energetic electrons over the blackbody distribution , obtaining simple and highly accurate formulae in close form . in the isotropic case",
    ", we compare our results with the approximation of @xcite , as well as with calculation in the electron rest frame , see appendix [ rest ] .",
    "our results give compton photon redistribution functions for highly relativistic electrons at a single energy , i.e. , the distribution of the energies and directions of the scattered photon . at low energies ,",
    "the electrons have usually a maxwellian distribution , for which the corresponding redistribution function has recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "the rate of compton scattering ( in both thomson and klein - nishina regimes ) of a photon beam from direction @xmath4 into direction @xmath5 by a cloud of relativistic electrons with lorentz factors @xmath6 is given by equation ( 20 ) of @xcite , and it can be written as , @xmath7,\\nonumber}\\\\ \\lefteqn{\\quad \\quad y\\equiv 1-\\mathbf{\\omega}\\cdot \\mathbf{\\omega_1},\\quad \\epsilon_{\\rm m}\\equiv { \\epsilon_1\\over 2 y\\gamma ( \\gamma-\\epsilon_1 ) } , \\label{rate}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( @xmath8 , @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath9 , @xmath5 ) are the energy in units of @xmath10 and the direction of the incoming and scattered photon , respectively , @xmath11 is the electron mass , @xmath12 is the electron number per unit @xmath0 and per unit solid angle , and @xmath13 is the density of photons coming from direction of @xmath4 .",
    "then , the range of kinematically allowed values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 can be expressed in three equivalent forms , @xmath14,\\,\\ , \\epsilon_1\\leq { 2 y\\epsilon\\gamma^2\\over 1 + 2 y\\epsilon\\gamma},\\,\\ , \\gamma\\geq   { \\epsilon_1\\over 2 } \\left(1+\\sqrt { 1+{2\\over \\epsilon\\epsilon_1 y}}\\right ) ,   \\label{range}\\ ] ] as well as @xmath15 is required .",
    "the first of the above conditions is used for integration over @xmath8 . note that equation ( [ rate ] ) assumes the directions of the electron and scattered photons to be the same .",
    "this is because electrons with @xmath6 emit in a narrow beam along its direction of motion , and thus , in the adopted approximation , only electrons moving along the scattered photon direction contribute to the spectrum .",
    "consequently , the same equation applies for either anisotropic or isotropic @xmath12 ( although @xcite considered it for isotropic electrons only ) .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ rate ] ) agrees , in the limits of @xmath6 and @xmath15 , with equation ( 20 ) of @xcite , which gives a formula for emission by an electron beam scattering off a photon beam valid at any @xmath0 and @xmath8 . for an isotropic electron distribution , @xmath16 .",
    "we note that our equation ( [ rate ] ) , equation ( 20 ) of @xcite , as well as equation ( 6 ) of @xcite are given for unit @xmath12 whereas equation ( 20 ) of @xcite is normalized to @xmath17 .    ) , plotted per unit @xmath18 ( red solid curve ) compared to the thomson - limit rate ( black dashed curve ) for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and in the thomson units . at low @xmath9",

    "the low - energy , @xmath26 , limit of the scattering rate is different , and given by equation ( [ rate ] ) with the factor in brackets replaced by 1 , which is valid for _ any _ @xmath27 .",
    "the distinction between these two limits is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratekn_th ] .    an interesting feature of the rate ( [ rate ] ) in the klein - nishina limit , @xmath28 , is it showing a sharp peak at the maximum allowed @xmath9 , above which it is cut off .",

    "[ ratekn_th ] , comparing that rate to its thomson limit .",
    "the total , integrated over @xmath9 , rate is lower , but the rate per unit @xmath9 is much higher than that in the thomson limit just before the cutoff .",

    "this formula follows from the fact that the flux , @xmath56 , from a uniformly emitting sphere is given by @xmath57 @xcite , and the photon density for a mono - directional beam is @xmath58 .",
    "the scattering rate can be integrated over the photon distribution , @xmath59 here , we have set the upper limits of integration to infinity for the sake of simplicity , in spite of the condition of @xmath15 assumed in equation ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "this has a negligible effect on the results as long as @xmath60 .",
    "comparing equations ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ bb ] ) , we see that the rate ( [ int_rate ] ) involves three integrals with different powers of @xmath8 .",

    "we note that @xcite considered isotropic scattering by relativistic electrons on blackbody photons using an approach different from that adopted in section [ iso ] .",
    "he calculated the spectrum of isotropic blackbody photons in the electron rest frame ( see also see also @xcite ) , assuming that all the photons arrive in the frame direction , which is approximately satisfied for the electron lorentz factor of @xmath6 .",
    "this yields @xcite , @xmath141 where @xmath27 is the dimensionless photon energy in the electron rest frame , see section [ aniso ] .",
    "since @xmath142 is an invariant ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the above distribution can be used for numerical integration of the rate of compton scattering over @xmath27 , see equation ( 4.7 ) in @xcite .",
    "this is fully equivalent to integrating the angle - averaged rate ( [ rateiso ] ) with blackbody photons over @xmath8 , see section [ iso ] .",
    "an advantage of using the photon distribution in the particle rest frame is that it can be readily used for other reactions by highly relativistic particles on blackbody photons , e.g. , e@xmath143 pair production by cosmic - ray protons ."
