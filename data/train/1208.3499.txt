    "nasa s _ kepler _  mission continues to identify many candidate transiting exoplanet systems , which now number nearly 2000 @xcite .",
    "the process of confirming or validating these planet candidates as real exoplanets often requires a significant amount of analysis and effort ; and consequently the number of confirmed planets lags far behind the new candidate discoveries . in an effort to ameliorate this situation we published a new approach to planet confirmation that requires a less detailed analysis @xcite and can generally be accomplished in much less time .",
    "this approach essentially relies on demonstrating that two transiting candidates are in the same system and that their masses are planetary .",
    "both aspects of this confirmation method rely on dynamical interactions .",
    "first , planets are shown to be in the same system by looking for anticorrelated transit timing variations ( ttvs ) that arise from short - term changes in obital period due to planet - planet interactions within the system @xcite .",
    "second , the candidates are shown to have planetary mass by requiring that the system be dynamically stable .",
    "this method is a particularly useful means of identifying true planetary systems from among the false positive systems  allowing ground - based follow - up resources to be devoted to studying systems that are both real and dynamically interesting ( as manifest by their significant ttv signal ) .",
    "while detailed ttv analyses have been instrumental in confirming several multiplanet systems ( e.g. , kepler 9 @xcite , kepler 11 @xcite , kepler 18 @xcite , and kepler 36 @xcite ) , 21 planets in 10 multiplanet systems have been confirmed by these new methods that we apply again here ( kepler systems 23 through 32 , @xcite ) . these 10 confirmed multiplanet systems include several that have particularly interesting properties and are likely to be the subject of future investigations .",
    "for example : all of the systems are near mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) , kepler-25 ( koi-244 , @xcite ) is relatively bright at kp @xmath0 , kepler-30 ( koi-806 , @xcite ) has ttvs that deviate from a constant period by nearly a day over the course of the _ kepler _  data , and many ( kepler 23 , 24 , 26 , 31 , and 32 ) have additional planet candidates that may be confirmed or validated .",
    "as more data from _ kepler _  are gathered , new systems that can be confirmed by the means outlined above can be found . in this paper",
    "we apply the same methods used in @xcite to 2 additional quarters of _ kepler _  data ( all data through q8 ) and confirm 27  new planets in 13  systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ secproperties ]",
    "we summarize the stellar properties for the host stars in these systems and the basic orbital and physical characteristics of the planets .",
    "the dynamical confirmation of the relevant 27  planets is presented in  [ secconfirm ] .",
    "we make concluding remarks in  [ secconclusion ] .",
    "data and results from some of the analyses performed in this paper are shown in the appendix .",
    "we take the stellar properties from the tables given in @xcite .",
    "the procedure used for determining the stellar parameters ( effective temperature teff , surface gravity @xmath1 and stellar radius @xmath2 ) for our systems was discussed in detail in section 5.2 of that paper . in most cases , teff and @xmath1 that were determined photometrically and reported in the _ kepler _  input catalog",
    "were used as a starting point .",
    "these values were then corrected by matching to the yonsei - yale stellar evolution models @xcite ( cf . figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "_ kepler _  followup observing program reconnaissance spectra have also been obtained for most of these kois .",
    "in general there is reasonable agreement between the stellar parameters in table 1 and those obtained through the reconnaissance spectroscopy . in a few cases of disagreement",
    ", the discrepancy can be attributed to the low s / n of the reconnaissance spectra , thus we rely on the published parameters .",
    "the basic planet size and orbital properties for the systems under consideration are also taken from @xcite and are given in table [ tabplanets ] . we note that the giant star koi-1241  along with koi-262  are quite bright and therefore amenable to in - depth asteroseismic study .",
    "we expect that the stellar properties , particularly for the giant , may be revised somewhat from the values presented here and in @xcite once such studies have been completed . in neither case",
    "is the planet interpretation of the transiting candidates in jeopardy ."
