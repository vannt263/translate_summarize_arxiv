    "despite the tremendous progress realized in the study of the bare nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction as well as equally impressive advances in the theory of the effective @xmath6 interaction in the shell model , it has not been possible to systematically account for the properties of finite nuclei solely on the basis of two - body interactions .",
    "studies of the roles played by many - body forces ( @xmath7 3-body and 4-body ) suggest that they provide small yet important contributions @xcite .",
    "however , more careful analysis of nuclear many - body systems is needed to fully identify these roles @xcite . adding to this complexity , the @xmath0 no core shell model ( @xmath8 ) @xcite generates effective many - body forces which have been shown to decrease in strength with increasing basis space size .",
    "overall , the nature of the `` real '' and the `` effective '' many - body forces remains quite complicated and elusive .    in this work ,",
    "we present a phenomenological model of three - body and higher multi - body interactions as a simple , two - parameter and basis - space - dependent interaction .",
    "this multi - body interaction is added to our theoretically - derived two - body effective interaction , and its two parameters are adjusted in each basis space so as to reproduce results in agreement with experimental data .",
    "thus , ours is a @xmath9 multi - body interaction obtained in a phenomenological way .",
    "our chosen functional form is a delta function reminiscent of the recent attention of effective field theory ( @xmath10 ) to expansions of nuclear interactions beginning with zero - range terms . in @xmath10",
    "there is an appropriate cutoff in momentum transfers , corresponding to the poorly - known short - range part of the nuclear potential @xcite . in a similar spirit",
    ", we model the poorly known many - body forces as harmonic - oscillator - cutoff - dependent zero - range interactions @xcite .    more specifically , we model the residual multi - body interaction by a one - parameter two - body delta interaction and a one - parameter multi - body interaction .",
    "the multi - body interaction consists of a two - body delta times a number operator , ^ n@xmath5 , that measures the excitations in oscillator quanta of the spectators .",
    "we expect and find that the contribution of the two - body part of the interaction weakens as the basis space increases and as our theoretically - derived effective two - body interaction approaches the exact two - body interaction . on the other hand , we find as expected that the multi - body part of our residual interaction remains relatively strong , which provides an indication of the role played by @xmath11body forces ( @xmath12 ) in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 approach in shell - model studies of the nuclear many - body problem @xcite begins with the one- and two - body hamiltonian for the @xmath13-nucleon system , i.e. ,    @xmath14    with @xmath15 the nucleon mass and @xmath16 the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "we then add the center - of - mass harmonic - oscillator ( @xmath17 ) potential @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "the total center - of - mass harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is later subtracted to leave a purely intrinsic hamiltonian . at this stage",
    "we have a convenient mean field acting on each nucleon that helps our overall convergence when working in a @xmath17 set of basis states .",
    "we emphasize that we adopt proper measures to ensure that the @xmath22 properties of the many - body system are not affected by the center - of - mass term and we discuss our specific procedure for this in more detail below .",
    "the modified hamiltonian , thus , acquires a dependence on the @xmath17 frequency @xmath23 , and can then be written as    @xmath24   + \\sum_{i < j}^{a } \\left [ v_{ij } - \\frac{m \\omega^2}{2a}(\\vec{r_i } -   \\vec{r_j})^2 \\right ] \\ ] ]    actual shell - model calculations can only be carried out in a finite basis space defined by a projection operator @xmath25 , with the complementary space to the finite basis space ( i.e. the excluded space ) defined by the projection operator @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , due to its strong short - range part , the realistic nuclear interaction in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) will yield pathological results unless we derive a basis - space dependent @xmath27 hamiltonian :    @xmath28 p   + p \\left [ \\sum_{i < j}^{a }   \\left ( v_{ij } - \\frac{m \\omega^2}{2a}{(\\vec{r_i } -   \\vec{r_j})}^2 \\right ) \\right ] _ { eff } p\\ ] ]    the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is an effective interaction that is , in general , an @xmath13-body interaction .",
    "if the effective interaction is determined without any approximations , the basis - space hamiltonian provides an identical description of a subset of states as the exact original hamiltonian @xcite . from among the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( 3 ) , it is necessary to choose only those that correspond to the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "this can be achieved first by working in a complete @xmath29 basis space , and then by projecting the center - of - mass eigenstates with energies greater than @xmath30 ( representing spurious center - of - mass motion ) upwards in the energy spectrum @xcite . in our case , we do this by adding @xmath31 to and subtracting @xmath32 from equation ( 3 ) above .",
    "one unit of @xmath33 has already been incorporated , as mentioned above , and it is also subtracted at this stage .",
    "the resulting shell - model hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath34 p\\\\    & & + p \\left [ \\sum_{i < j}^{a } \\left ( v_{ij } - \\frac{m \\omega^2}{2a}{(\\vec{r_i } -   \\vec{r_j})}^2 \\right ) \\right ] _ { eff } p + \\beta p(h^{\\omega}_{c.m.}-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega)p\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is a sufficiently large positive parameter .",
    "when applied in a suitably chosen finite @xmath17 basis space , this procedure removes the spurious center - of - mass motion , and has no effect on the intrinsic spectrum of states @xcite .",
    "our choice of the @xmath25-space is fixed by @xmath29 that signifies a many - body basis space of all @xmath17 slater determinants having total @xmath17 quanta less than or equal to the cutoff given by @xmath36 .",
    "we refer to this as a complete @xmath29 basis space .",
    "it is complete in the sense it allows the precise removal of spurious center - of - mass motion effects .    in principle , the effective interaction introduced in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) above should reproduce exactly the full - space results in the finite basis space for some subset of physical states .",
    "furthermore , an @xmath2body effective interaction is required for an @xmath2nucleon system . in practice , however , the @xmath2body effective interaction can not be calculated exactly , and it is approximated by a two - body effective interaction determined for a two - nucleon sub - system or two - nucleon cluster .    in this work ,",
    "we follow the procedure described in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to construct the two - body effective interaction .",
    "the procedure employs the lee - suzuki @xcite similarity transformation method , which yields an interaction in the form    @xmath37    with @xmath38 the transformation operator satisfying @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 operators that project on the two - nucleon finite basis and complementary spaces , respectively .",
    "note that we distinguish between the two - nucleon system projection operators @xmath42 and the @xmath2nucleon system projection operators @xmath43 .",
    "note also that the size of the two - nucleon basis is dictated by the choice of @xmath29 for the a - body problem .",
    "our calculations start with exact solutions of the two - body hamiltonian    @xmath44   + \\left [ v_{12}(\\vec{r_1 } - \\vec{r_2 } ) - \\frac{m \\omega^2}{2a}(\\vec{r_1 } -   \\vec{r_2})^2 \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which follows from reducing the shell - model hamiltonian ( 2 ) to the two - nucleon case .",
    "the exact solutions are obtained by assuming a 0@xmath45 motion of the center - of - mass of nucleons 1 and 2 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the two - nucleon @xmath17 states which form the basis space signified by @xmath40 , and let @xmath47 denote those that form the @xmath48space .",
    "dropping the subscript `` 2 '' for convenience , one can then express the @xmath49space components of an eigenvector @xmath50 of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) as a combination of the @xmath51space components with the help of the operator @xmath38 :    @xmath52 , we may then choose a set @xmath53 of @xmath54 eigenvectors for which relation ( 6 ) will be exactly satisfied @xcite . typically , these @xmath54 states will be the lowest states obtained in a given channel . under the condition that the @xmath55 matrix @xmath56 for @xmath50 @xmath57 @xmath53 is invertible , the operator @xmath38 can be determined from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and the effective hamiltonian can then be constructed as follows :    @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this hamiltonian , when diagonalized in a finite basis space , reproduces exactly the set @xmath53 of @xmath54 eigenvalues @xmath59 of the defined 2-body problem .",
    "note that the effective hamiltonian ( 7 ) is not hermitian , and that it can be transformed into a hermitian form @xmath60 by applying a similarity transformation determined from the metric operator @xmath61 @xcite :    @xmath62^{1/2}h_{2eff } [ p_2(1+\\omega^{\\dagger}\\omega)p_2]^{-1/2}\\ ] ]    the two - body effective interaction actually used in the present calculations is determined from this two - nucleon effective hamiltonian as @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting two - body effective interaction @xmath64 depends on @xmath13 , on the @xmath17 frequency @xmath23 , and on @xmath65 , the maximum many - body @xmath17 excitation energy ( above the lowest configuration ) defining the @xmath51space .",
    "furthermore , when used in the shell - model hamiltonian ( 4 ) , it results in the factorization of our many - body wave function into a product of a center - of - mass @xmath30 component times an intrinsic component , which allows exact correction of any observable for spurious center - of - mass effects , thus preserving translational invariance .",
    "this feature distinguishes our approach from most phenomenological shell - model studies that involve multiple @xmath17 shells .",
    "so far , the most important approximation used in our approach is the neglect of contributions coming from higher than two - body clusters to our effective hamiltonian . although our method can be readily generalized to include the effects of three - body clusters , leading to the derivation of a three - body effective interaction , so far this has only been done in @xmath66 and @xmath67 systems @xcite , and it is not yet clear how difficult it will be to extend it to the @xmath68shell nuclei with @xmath69 and with the same range of @xmath29 values accessible at the 2-body cluster level .    in order",
    "to approximately account for the many - body effects neglected when using only a two - body effective interaction , we introduce a simple residual interaction that depends on all particles .",
    "more specifically , our residual many - body interaction contains a delta function times the sum of the oscillator quanta for the @xmath70 spectators denoted by @xmath71 and defined by    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final many - body states , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final two - nucleon states @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , interacting through the delta function .",
    "why do we introduce such a dependence of the many - body forces ?",
    "we are motivated by the experience with the `` multi-@xmath79 '' method of addressing effective many - body forces @xcite , which is based on the role of the spectators in a many - body matrix element . as the spectators are excited , the effective @xmath40 space for the interacting pair decreases and this increases the attraction of the @xmath79-matrix .",
    "the spectator dependence in the multi-@xmath79 approach to the effective many - body forces predominantly lowers the excited multi-@xmath45 states .    in this connection",
    ", one might imagine , as we do , the spectator dependence to be of a form where the strength is weakest when the spectators have 0@xmath45 excitation ( above their minimum value ) and strongest when they have the maximum excitation .",
    "these two situations correspond , respectively , to when the 2-particles roam over the entire @xmath80 and over only the lowest @xmath45 range .",
    "thus , we expect this @xmath71-dependent term to be attractive and account for the leading effects observed in the multi-@xmath79 investigations .",
    "we also allow for a spectator - independent term in the many - body force and we will take it to be a delta function for simplicity .",
    "we expect this term will approximate the many - body effective force components that are largely independent of the spectator configurations .",
    "we expect this contribution to be repulsive in order to correct for the overbinding found in smaller model spaces when @xmath81 is approximated with the 2-body cluster form @xcite .",
    "we will see below that the fits to nuclear spectra verify these expectations .",
    "our total effective many - body interaction is then expressed in the form of a zero - range two - body interaction , and two parameters , one of which multiplies the many - body variable @xmath71 introduced above :    @xmath82    where @xmath79 is a fixed strength parameter taken to be 1 @xmath83 in the present work . the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 are basis - space dependent dimensionless parameters to be determined by fits to selected many - body observables .",
    "we will then use this schematic residual interaction to study the role played by the many - body forces that were neglected in our derivation of the effective two - body interaction .",
    "we shall derive the latter from the realistic argonne @xmath1 @xmath6 potential @xcite , and perform calculations of some basic observables in the @xmath67 system with and without the addition of the residual many - body interaction @xmath86 , and in various basis spaces .",
    "we solve for the properties of @xmath67 nuclei using the @xmath87scheme many - fermion dynamics code @xcite that was developed for no - core shell - model ( @xmath8 ) calculations .",
    "in this section we apply the methods outlined in sec .",
    "ii to derive the effective two - body interaction , based on the argonne @xmath1 @xmath6 potential , which we then use in the remainder of our work .",
    "however , it is now well - known that two - body interactions alone are not sufficient , and in order to better account for such experimental facts as the binding energy of nuclei , one is led to introduce three - body and higher multi - body forces . in the following discussion , we first consider calculations done with only the argonne @xmath1 two - body interaction in order to see how such two - body calculations compare with experiment .",
    "we then ask the following question : what couplings @xmath88 for the residual many - body interaction are needed in order to achieve as close an agreement with experiment as possible ?    we use a complete @xmath29 basis space with , e.g. , @xmath89 for the positive - parity states of @xmath90 .",
    "this means that nine major @xmath17 shells are employed .",
    "the two - nucleon basis space is defined in our calculations by @xmath65 , e.g. , for an 8@xmath45 calculation for @xmath90 we have @xmath65=8 .",
    "the restriction of the @xmath17 shell occupation is given by @xmath91 where the single - particle @xmath17 quanta are given by @xmath92 .",
    "the same conditions hold for the relative @xmath93 , center - of - mass @xmath94 , and @xmath95 quantum numbers , respectively .    in the case of the @xmath67 system",
    ", we seek to reproduce the following obervables as accurately as possible : the binding energy of the ground state ( @xmath96 ) as well as the energies of the first three excited states .",
    "we are also interested in reproducing the root - mean - square radius @xmath97 .      in table 1",
    "we present the experimental energies of the low - lying states that are relevant to our present study .",
    "the binding energies of the ground states are given first , followed by the excitation energies of the first three excited states ( all energies are in @xmath98 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the root - mean - square point - charge radius of the ground state of @xmath90 is known experimentally to be 1.46 @xmath99 , which we also take to be the point mass radius .      before we embark upon the investigation of the many - body force ,",
    "let us first examine the theoretical predictions of the @xmath90 spectrum using only the argonne @xmath1 plus the coulomb interaction . in table 2 , we present results of calculations of the first two positive - parity and the first two negative - parity states , using the interaction in increasingly larger basis spaces ( indicated by @xmath65 , as defined above ) .",
    "the results depend somewhat on the choice of @xmath45 , the @xmath17 energy parameter , but we shall adopt the value @xmath45=19 @xmath98 , which is suggested by the phenomenological expression @xcite    @xmath100    in the large @xmath65 limit our results become independent of the choice of @xmath45 @xcite .    as shown in table 2 ,",
    "it is clear that the argonne @xmath1 interaction overbinds the ground state for @xmath101 and underbinds it for @xmath102 and 10 , with the overbinding decreasing ( and the underbinding increasing ) as @xmath65 increases . on the other hand , the excitation energy of the @xmath103 state steadily @xmath104 with @xmath65 .",
    "if a two - body force is alone sufficient , and if the argonne @xmath1 plus coulomb interaction represents a sufficiently accurate form of this two - body force , we would expect our calculations to converge to the experimental values . by examining table 2 ,",
    "it becomes clear that while the first positive - parity excited state ( @xmath103 ) and the negative - parity states ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) are becoming more bound with increasing @xmath65 , the ground state itself ( @xmath96 ) is becoming less bound .",
    "furthermore , while the discrepancy between the calculated and the experimental ground - state energy is reduced with increasing @xmath65 ( from 12% with @xmath107 to less than 4% with @xmath108 ) , the improvement is less favorable for the energies of the excited states ( @xmath109 from 51% with @xmath107 to 23% with @xmath108 for the @xmath103 state ) .",
    "the percentages used here represent the percent error ( in absolute value ) of the calculated energy relative to the experimental value . for the ground state ,",
    "this is based on the total binding energy , whereas for the excited states it is based on the excitation energy .",
    "we are , thus , led to conclude that the two - body force used is somewhat deficient and we need either a better two - body force , or three - body and/or higher many - body forces , in general .",
    "this is exactly the situation that we wish to investigate with our zero - range , spectator - dependent , residual delta interaction .",
    "next , we consider the effect of adding our residual delta interaction to the derived effective 2-body interaction in order to obtain a 2 + many - body potential :    @xmath110\\times g\\delta(\\vec{r_1}-\\vec{r_2}).\\ ] ]    by adding the spectator - dependent phenomenological interaction introduced in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we are simply modelling the contribution of all residual many - body forces , omitted by our derived two - body effective interaction .",
    "we then vary the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 independently for each basis space , in order to achieve good agreement with the experimental ground - state binding energy and excitation energy of the first excited @xmath111 state of @xmath90 .",
    "the results are shown in table 3 and illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . we note that @xmath84 is positive , while @xmath85 is negative , and that both are decreasing functions of @xmath65 , with @xmath84 decreasing somewhat faster than @xmath85 . as the ground state",
    "was found to be overbound , whereas the first excited state was found to be underbound by the pure two - body interaction ( see table 2 ) , it should not be surprising that @xmath84 turns out to be positive , while @xmath85 is negative .",
    "it is also reassuring to see both @xmath84 and @xmath85 decrease steadily ( in absolute value ) with @xmath65 , indicating that the need for the residual many - body interaction @xmath112 decreases and that the adequacy of the two - body interaction increases as the basis space becomes larger .",
    "more precisely , the result that @xmath113 as @xmath114 , is not surprising , as it indicates that there is little or no correction needed at the pure two - body level to our hamiltonian",
    ". on the other hand , the @xmath85-term , which carries all the information about the `` true '' many - body interaction , is @xmath115 converging to zero .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that it is possible to accommodate the contribution of the missing many - body interaction and to represent it in the simple form of @xmath116 for these observables .",
    "we are now in a position to examine the predictive power of our extended effective hamiltonian .",
    "we begin by asking how well such a residual many - body interaction ( determined in the case of @xmath90 ) can help reconcile the calculated spectra of @xmath117 and @xmath118 with the experimental situation ? in tables 4 and 5 we show the results obtained with and without the residual many - body interaction and compare them to experiment .",
    "we are now addressing ( @xmath119 ) negative - parity states , so we perform our calculations in an @xmath120 basis space , and we use the values @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which were determined in the earlier fit to @xmath90 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "it is clear from the results shown in tables 4 and 5 that a much better agreement with experiment is achieved for both @xmath117 and @xmath118 when our residual many - body interaction is added to the pure two - body interaction . aside from the improved agreement for the ground states and first excited states",
    ", we observe that it is only by including the residual many - body interaction that the calculated @xmath105 and @xmath123 states in @xmath118 become bound , in accord with experiment .    based on the overall results for the @xmath124 isotopes , presented above",
    ", we can identify a procedure for improving the many - body force .",
    "in particular , the @xmath90 fit can be interpreted as determining the spin - isospin averaged values of the couplings for our many - body force . by allowing spin - isospin dependence in the couplings",
    ", we could fine tune the coupling strengths , while preserving their average values , so as to obtain an improved description of the other isotopes .",
    "thus , we can introduce an isospin dependence in our residual many - body force as follows :    @xmath125\\times g\\delta(\\vec{r_1}-\\vec{r_2}).\\ ] ]    or , equivalently , by assigning different values for @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the @xmath126 and @xmath119 channels , denoted by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we do this while keeping the isospin average of @xmath129 and @xmath130 to be equal to @xmath84 , and likewise for @xmath131 and @xmath132 . applying a minimum root - mean - square convergence criterion on the calculated energies of the first two states in each of the @xmath67 nuclei considered relative to their experimental values , we find that it is possible to improve the calculations when using an isospin - dependent version of the residual many - body interaction ( table 6 )",
    ".    it would be interesting to study whether our model of the residual many - body interaction can be generalized to the study of @xmath133 systems .",
    "for example , the test of the spin - isospin dependent many - body force can then be carried out in the a = 5 systems .",
    "this effort is underway and will be reported in another paper .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a simple model for treating multi - body interactions in nuclear - structure calculations in terms of a two - parameter , basis - space - dependent delta interaction .",
    "we determine the two - parameters as a function of basis - space size by fits to the lowest two @xmath134 states of @xmath90 .",
    "the parameter values decrease with basis - space size , as anticipated .",
    "the obtained multi - body interaction also yields improved agreement with experiment for negative parity states in @xmath90 and for the t = 1 states of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which were not included in the empirical fits .",
    "the advantages of our model for the multi - body interaction in nuclei are two - fold : ( 1 ) the model provides a simple method for including multi - body interactions into nuclear - structure calculations , thereby yielding improved agreement with experiment , and ( 2 ) the model will give us insight into the nature of such multi - body interactions , so that we will be able to model them more realistically in the future .",
