    "in this paper we investigate particle detector models in topologically non - trivial spacetimes .",
    "the aims are two - fold .",
    "firstly we discuss a recent paper by schlicht @xcite in which the usual regularization procedure for the positive frequency wightman function @xcite is criticized in the context of particle detectors in minkowski space and an alternative is proposed .",
    "we extend the regularization introduced by schlicht to minkowski space of arbitrary dimension , to the massive scalar field , to automorphic fields and to the massless dirac field .",
    "secondly we present detector responses on certain topologically non - trivial spacetimes , with the aim of investigating the effect of the non - trivial topology on the unruh and hawking effects @xcite .",
    "particle detector models in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime were first considered by unruh @xcite , who proved his now famous result that a uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space responds as in a thermal bath at the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "unruh s model consists of a particle in a box coupled to the quantum field .",
    "the detection of a particle is indicated by the excitation of the detector by the field . shortly after unruh , dewitt @xcite considered a simpler model consisting of a monopole moment operator coupled to the field along the detector s worldline .",
    "this is the model subsequently considered most in the literature .",
    "good reviews of the early literature are found in @xcite .    in the usual derivation of the unruh effect using dewitt s monopole detector",
    "the detection is considered in the asymptotic regions where the detector is switched on in the infinite past and off in the infinite future .",
    "recently schlicht @xcite has considered the case of a detector switched on in the infinite past but read at a finite time @xmath9 and has highlighted the importance of choosing a suitable regularization of the wightman function . in particular",
    "schlicht shows that a naive @xmath10-prescription , as is usually used in the asymptotic case @xcite , for a uniformly accelerated detector , leads to a @xmath9-dependent and thus presumably unphysical response .",
    "schlicht proposes an alternative regularization procedure by considering the monopole detector as the limit of a rigid detector with spatial extension .",
    "the monopole moment operator is coupled to the field via a smeared field operator where the smearing is performed in the detector s rest frame .",
    "he recovers the usual responses in the case of inertial and uniformly accelerated motion .",
    "he further considers a trajectory which smoothly interpolates between the two obtaining physically reasonable results .",
    "we begin here in section [ sec - linmink ] by extending the regularization introduced by schlicht @xcite to a massless scalar field in minkowski space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "we recover the expected responses for inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors . in section [ sec",
    ": massive ] we extend the regularization further to a massive scalar field in four - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "in section [ sec : autodetector ] we consider detectors on quotient spaces of minkowski space under certain discrete isometry groups , via detectors coupled to automorphic fields @xcite in minkowski space .",
    "we begin by extending schlicht s regularization to these quotient spaces .",
    "we then present a number of responses on a number of specific spacetimes and trajectories of interest .",
    "our main motivation is to investigate the effect of non - trivial topology on the hawking and unruh effects . in particular",
    "our interest lies in the ( non)-thermality of the hartle - hawking - like vacuum on the @xmath7 geon black hole spacetime as seen by static observers @xcite and the euclidean - like vacuum state on @xmath7 de sitter space @xcite .",
    "we consider inertial and uniformly accelerated observers on the quotient spaces of minkowski space under the involutions @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( denoted here by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively ) , in the minkowski - like vacuum states . @xmath13 and @xmath14 may be used to model the hawking effect on the kruskal manifold and the @xmath7 geon respectively @xcite and to illustrate the affect of the topology on the unruh effect in flat spacetimes .",
    "we also consider inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors on minkowski space with an infinite flat plane boundary , on a conical spacetime and on some higher dimensional generalizations .    for motions perpendicular to the boundary the boundary spacetime serves as a simpler model in which many of the features of the responses on @xmath14 are present .",
    "further the responses are interesting in their own right .",
    "the boundary spacetime with dirichlet boundary conditions has been used to investigate the detection of negative energy densities @xcite and may have relevance to the quantum inequalities program @xcite . in the literature the time independent response of detectors with motion parallel to the boundary has been considered @xcite .",
    "we present the time dependent response of detectors with motion perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "the conical spacetime may be considered as the spacetime outside an infinite , straight and zero radius cosmic string .",
    "the response of detectors travelling parallel to such a string has been considered in @xcite .",
    "we present the response of a detector approaching the string .    in section [ sec : dirac ]",
    "we extend the model of schlicht to the massless dirac field both in minkowski space and in the quotient spaces using the automorphic field theory .",
    "for inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors we recover the expected results for the transition rate and power spectrum @xcite on minkowski space , and we discuss these detectors on @xmath13 .",
    "further we address the issue as to whether or not such a detector can distinguish the two spin structures on @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately on @xmath14 we find that our model is not sensitive to the spin structure for any motions at constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "finally the responses on the boundary and conical spacetimes and the higher dimensional generalizations of section [ sec : autodetector ] are relevant also for the responses of static detectors on the @xmath7 geon and inertial detectors in @xmath7 de sitter space , via their associated global embedding minkowski spaces ( gems ) @xcite .",
    "although until now the gems procedure has only been applied to kinematical arguments we expect that at least in some cases the response of detectors in the original curved spaces and the corresponding ones in their gems should be related in some way . in section [ sec : geon ]",
    "we begin with a brief review of the gems literature .",
    "we then present an embedding of the kruskal manifold in a @xmath15-dimensional minkowski space , introduced in @xcite , and a related embedding of the @xmath7 geon in a @xmath15-dimensional minkowski space with identifications .",
    "the hawking temperature as seen by a static observer on the kruskal manifold is obtained by kinematical arguments from the related unruh temperature of the observer in the embedding space .",
    "we then argue that on the @xmath7 geon the response of a static detector , in the hartle - hawking - like vacuum , should be related to the response of the associated unruh observer in the embedding space , in the minkowski - like vacuum .",
    "this response is given by results in section [ sec : autodetector ] .",
    "in section [ sec - desitrp3 ] we consider inertial detectors in de sitter and @xmath7 de sitter space .",
    "we begin by introducing a causal detector and calculating the response of a uniformly accelerated detector in de sitter space , in the euclidean vacuum , in a causal way .",
    "the thermal result agrees with the literature @xcite .",
    "next we consider the response of an inertial detector in @xmath7 de sitter space , in the euclidean - like vacuum with the motion perpendicular to the distinguished foliation @xcite .",
    "the response is seen to be identical to that of the uniformly accelerated detector on four - dimensional minkowski space with infinite plane boundary found in section [ sec : autodetector ] . on de sitter and",
    "@xmath7 de sitter space we also consider the response of detectors via their @xmath16-dimensional gems .",
    "the thermal response in de sitter space has been given before @xcite .",
    "the gems calculation on @xmath7 de sitter space is a particularly interesting one as we are able to present the calculation both in the curved space and in the embedding space .",
    "it is found that the responses are qualitatively very similar .",
    "this case should therefore be very useful in assessing the validity of applying the gems procedure to cases involving quotient spaces and time dependent detector responses .",
    "we work throughout in natural units @xmath17 and with metric signature @xmath18 . in @xmath19-dimensional minkowski space , the spatial @xmath20-vectors are denoted by bold face characters @xmath21 with @xmath22 the usual scalar product in @xmath23 , while @xmath19-vectors ( used occasionally ) are given by an italic script @xmath24 with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the minkowski metric .",
    "in this section we introduce dewitt s monopole detector @xcite .",
    "we discuss the use of spatial sampling functions to regularize the correlation function and extend the regularization in @xcite , using a lorentzian sampling function , to @xmath19-dimensional minkowski space @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the model is that of a monopole detector , moving along a prescribed classical trajectory in @xmath27 and coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath29 .",
    "the field has hamiltonian @xmath30 , and satisfies the massless klein - gordon equation .",
    "the free field operator is expanded in terms of a standard complete set of orthonormal solutions to the field equation as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are usual minkowski coordinates and , in the massless case , @xmath33 .",
    "the field is quantized by imposing , for the creation and annihilation operators , the usual commutation relations @xmath34 = \\delta^{d-1}(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k ' } ) \\ .\\ ] ] the minkowski vacuum @xmath35 is the state annihilated by all the annihilation operators .",
    "the detector is a quantum mechanical system with a set of energy eigenstates @xmath36 .",
    "it moves along a prescribed classical trajectory @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath9 is the detector s proper time , and it couples to the scalar field via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a ( small ) coupling constant and @xmath41 is the detector s monopole moment operator @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath41 is given by @xmath42    suppose that at time @xmath43 the detector and field are in the product state @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a detector state with energy @xmath46 .",
    "the probability that at time @xmath47 the detector is found in an excited state @xmath48 , regardless of the final state of the field , is , to first order in perturbation theory @xmath49 this expression has two parts .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath50 depends only on the internal details of the detector and is not considered hereafter . the `` response function '' @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 for excitations and @xmath54 for de - excitations ) , does not depend on the internal details of the detector and so is common for all such detectors .",
    "we now follow schlicht @xcite and change coordinates to @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and then differentiate with respect to @xmath61 to obtain an expression for the `` transition rate '' @xmath62 where we have written @xmath63 .",
    "the transition rate is clearly causal in the sense that it does not depend on the state of motion of the detector after time @xmath9 but only on times @xmath64 which label the past motion of the detector .",
    "the correlation function @xmath65 in ( [ eq : transition ] ) is the positive frequency wightman function which can be obtained from the expansion ( [ eqn : modeexpan ] ) @xmath66 the integrals in ( [ eqn : integralwight ] ) may be performed by first transforming to hyperspherical coordinates in @xmath67-space .",
    "the @xmath68 integral requires regularization due to the usual ultraviolet divergences found in quantum field theory .",
    "the fundamental observation of reference @xcite is that if we regularize the divergences in ( [ eqn : integralwight ] ) using the usual @xmath10-prescription , that is we introduce the cut - off @xmath69 , and then use it to compute the transition rate ( [ eq : transition ] ) on a uniformly accelerated worldline with acceleration @xmath70 and proper time @xmath9 , @xmath71 with the detector switched on in the infinite past , @xmath72 , we obtain a time dependent and apparently unphysical result , instead of the expected time independent thermal result ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "schlicht shows this in four dimensions by specific numerical and analytic calculations , and the general @xmath19 case follows similarly .",
    "schlicht s proposal is to consider an alternative regularization where the monopole detector is considered as the limit of a detector with spatial extension which is rigid in the detector s rest frame . instead of the interaction hamiltonian ( [ eq : interhamil ] ) with @xmath73 we consider ( [ eq : interhamil ] ) with the monopole moment operator coupled to the smeared field @xmath74 where @xmath75 are fermi coordinates ( see e.g. @xcite ) and",
    "@xmath76 is a window sampling function of characteristic length @xmath77 . in effect",
    "( [ eq : smear ] ) introduces a cut - off at short distances of the order of @xmath77 in size .",
    "we may choose a window function with infinite support , such as that used in @xcite , if the window function decreases sufficiently rapidly at large distances . or we may consider a detector of truly finite extent with the use of a window function with compact support .",
    "we require the window function to be normalised as @xmath78 so that smearing a constant function will return that constant value .",
    "we also require the window function to approximate the @xmath20-dimensional dirac @xmath79 function , so that in the limit as @xmath77 tends to @xmath80 , ( [ eq : smear ] ) formally gives the field value @xmath81 .",
    "the window function hence staisfies @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "we now extend schlicht s regularization of the wightman function ( [ eqn : integralwight ] ) to @xmath19-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "although a large number of different window functions could be considered , the one chosen in @xcite seems to be the easiest for obtaining a closed expression for the wightman function on an arbitrary trajectory .    the @xmath19-dimensional analogue of the window function considered in @xcite is @xmath86}{\\pi^{d/2 } } \\frac{\\epsilon}{(\\mathbf{\\xi}^2+\\epsilon^2)^{d/2 } } \\ .\\ ] ] ( [ eq : shape ] ) is sometimes referred to as a lorentzian window or sampling function .",
    "it approximates a @xmath20-dimensional dirac @xmath79 function and is suitably normalized .    using ( [ eq : smear ] ) and ( [ eq : shape ] ) , we find @xmath87 the integrals over @xmath88 and @xmath89 in ( [ eq : expan ] )",
    "may be performed by transforming to hyperspherical coordinates and with analogous arguments to those used in @xcite in four dimensions we find @xmath90    the regularization introduced by the smearing of the field in the detector s rest frame may be viewed as an ultraviolet cut - off where high frequencies as seen by the detector are cut - off ( as opposed to the high frequencies as seen by an inertial observer which are cut - off by the usual @xmath10-prescription ) . the frequency is the time component of the @xmath0-momentum . given that the @xmath0-momentum in the usual minkowski frame is @xmath91 we find via a straightforward calculation that the time component of this @xmath0-vector in the fermi frame at time @xmath9 is @xmath92 .",
    "the regularization in ( [ eq : correlation ] ) is seen to be equivalent to an exponential cut - off of the high frequency modes , as seen in the detector s frame , at times @xmath9 and @xmath93 .",

    "\\label{eq : corre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note here that following a similar calculation to that given above the usual @xmath10 regularization of the correlation function may also be obtained by considering a spatially smeared field .",
    "the difference from the above regularization is that the smearing is done in the minkowski reference frame , that is , always with respect to inertial observers , and not in the fermi frame .",
    "this model detector is thus not rigid in its rest frame .",
    "first we consider the transition rate ( [ eq : transition ] ) with the correlation function ( [ eq : corre ] ) for a detector following an inertial trajectory .",

    "the transition rate is independent of @xmath9 along the trajectory and is given by @xmath103 where for @xmath104 and @xmath105 the products @xmath106 and + @xmath107 in ( [ thermal ] ) are both @xmath108 .",
    "the transition rate ( [ thermal ] ) is as in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is thermal with characteristic temperature @xmath109 in the sense that is satisfies the kms condition @xmath110 at that temperature ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "further ( [ thermal ] ) contains the expected `` apparent '' statistics inversion as we go from odd to even dimensions .",
    "in this section we compute the correlation function for the smeared field operator ( [ eq : smear ] ) for a massive scalar field .",
    "the detector model is as in section [ sec - linmink ] .",

    "the case @xmath134 is similar except we make the change of variables @xmath135 , @xmath125 again we may use the integral representation of @xmath130 and we obtain the same result ( [ eqn : masscorr ] ) .    the massless limit is easily checked .",
    "we have near @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xcite and so the correlation function ( [ eqn : masscorr ] ) agrees with that of schlicht @xcite in this limit .",
    "had we used the field operator without smearing we would have obtained ( [ eqn : massinteq ] ) with @xmath138 . the usual regularization procedure , as with the massless case , would then be to introduce a cut - off in the high frequency modes by @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is small",
    ". the result would be ( [ eqn : masscorr ] ) but with @xmath141 .",
    "in this section we adapt the detector model of section [ sec - linmink ] to spacetimes built as quotients @xmath142 of minkowski space under certain discrete symmetry groups @xmath143 . in particular we calculate responses on @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite , minkowski space with an infinite plane boundary and certain conical spacetimes .",
    "as these quotient spaces do not have infinite spatial sections in all directions , it does not directly make sense to consider a detector with infinite spatial extent as used in ( [ eq : smear ] ) .",
    "we shall argue however that we may introduce a detector similar to that of section [ sec - linmink ] by working with automorphic fields on @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "consider minkowski space @xmath27 in @xmath19 dimensions , and consider the quotient space @xmath142 where @xmath143 is some discrete isometry group .",
    "@xmath144 may be infinite ( as indeed is the case on @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) which will mean that some of the following expressions remain formal in those cases .",
    "we will find however that these formalities do not interfere as in any calculations done the infinities and the formally vanishing normalization factors will cancel to give finite results .",
    "the automorphic field @xmath145 is constructed from the ordinary field @xmath146 as the sum @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a representation of @xmath143 in @xmath149 .",

    ", we introduce on @xmath27 a detector linearly coupled to the automorphic field by @xmath152 with with the usual @xmath10 regularization , again we would find as schlicht does in minkowski space an unphysical result for the response of the uniformly accelerated detector on these spacetimes .",
    "this is most easily seen by considering that the @xmath153 term ( where @xmath154 is the identity element ) in ( [ eqn : automorcorre ] ) is that found in minkowski space . ]",
    "@xmath155 one might ask why we have not included in ( [ eqn : hamiauto ] ) image terms under @xmath143 ( that is one term for each image of the detector ) .",
    "there are two obvious ways in which such terms could be included .",
    "firstly we could consider each image term in the sum to be weighted by the representation @xmath148 .",
    "in certain situations , such as on minkowski space with an infinite plane boundary with dirichlet boundary conditions this would however lead to the detector and its image terms cancelling each other to give a vanishing interaction hamiltonian .",
    "alternatively we could consider image terms without the representation weights .",
    "then each image term would be equal to that in ( [ eqn : hamiauto ] ) and so we would obtain the same results with an overall ( possibly infinite ) normalisation factor , which can be absorbed in the coefficient @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore work with ( [ eqn : hamiauto ] ) .    from ( [ eqn : hamiauto ] ) , a discussion analogous to that in section [ sec - linmink ] leads to the transition rate ( to first order in perturbation theory ) @xmath156 where the correlation function for the automorphic field in ( [ eqn : autotrans ] ) , @xmath157 , is given by the method of images applied to ( [ eq : corre ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is a quotient of @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space where the quotienting group @xmath143 is that generated by the isometry @xmath11 .",
    "the transition rate for our detector is given by ( [ eqn : autotrans ] ) with @xmath158 where @xmath159 are the representations of @xmath143 , labelling untwisted ( twisted ) fields respectively .",
    "consider first a detector following the inertial trajectory @xmath160 where velocity @xmath161 , @xmath97 is the detector s proper time and @xmath162 , @xmath163 are constants .",
    "substituting the trajectory into ( [ eqn : corronm0 ] ) and then ( [ eqn : autotrans ] ) , we find that the transition rate for a detector switched on in the infinite past reads @xmath164 the integral may be done by residues .",
    "the result is @xmath165 as on minkowski space the transition rate vanishes for @xmath53 while it is non - zero for @xmath54 although the rate of spontaneous emission is altered from the minkowski rate due to the non - trivial topology .",
    "the transition rate depends on velocity @xmath166 due to the absence of a boost killing vector in the @xmath6 direction on @xmath13 .",
    "consider now the limit as @xmath167 . by the isometries of @xmath13",
    "this gives the response of an inertial detector that may have arbitrary velocity in the @xmath168 or @xmath5 directions .",
    "then @xmath169 in the case of an untwisted field , @xmath170 , the summation in ( [ eqn : transm0scalarinert ] ) is recognized as the fourier series of the @xmath171-periodic function that on the interval @xmath172 takes the form @xmath173 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the result agrees with that obtained by louko and marolf in @xcite .",
    "the response is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover it is thermal in the sense that it satisfies the kms condition ( [ eqn : kmscondition ] ) .",
    "there is however a break from the purely planckian form found on minkowski space .      in this subsection",
    "we consider a detector on @xmath19-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath180 , with minkowski coordinates @xmath181 , with an infinite boundary at @xmath182 .",
    "detectors on this spacetime ( in particular in the case of @xmath0-dimensions ) have been considered by a number of authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) has been the focus of some study recently on the response of detectors to negative energy  @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered the response of a finite time detector travelling inertially parallel to the boundary .",
    "they found that the negative energy outside the boundary has the effect of decreasing the excitations which are present even in minkowski space due to the switching of the detector . ] .",
    "however there has not been any presentations ( as far as the author is aware ) of the time dependent response for an inertial or uniformly accelerated observer who approaches the boundary from infinity .",
    "the results in this section are interesting also as a preliminary calculation before the response of detectors on @xmath14 is considered .",
    "many of the features seen here will also be observed there , but in a simpler context as there is no compact direction and therefore the image sum is finite .",

    "we begin with a massless dirac field @xmath286 on @xmath27 , expressed with respect to a vierbein that is invariant under @xmath143 .",

    "note that no simple relation holds between the power spectrum ( [ eqn : accepowerm0 ] ) and the transition rate of the linearly coupled scalar field detector ( [ m0response ] ) , in contrast to the relation we observed on the inertial worldline .",

    "we shall not present the result here .",
    "on @xmath14 we can again build expressions from those on @xmath27 ( or @xmath13 ) via the method of images .",
    "the transition rate is given by @xmath377 and @xmath378 where @xmath366 and @xmath379 are written in terms of a vierbein which rotates by @xmath171 in the @xmath380-plane as @xmath381 ( i.e. the one spin structure on @xmath13 compatible with the two on @xmath14 @xcite ) .",

    "it is therefore conceivable that a detector with a non - zero @xmath6-component of angular momentum could detect the spin structure .",

    "we consider therefore a detector following the trajectory @xmath387 where @xmath388 and @xmath389 are constants .",
    "first we note that there is no direct analogue of the rindler noise power spectrum here as the power spectrum is defined in @xcite only for stationary trajectories .",
    "we therefore look directly at the transition rate . from ( [ eq : m - intermsm0 ] ) and ( [ eq : transm- ] ) the transition rate will contain four terms . the first term , coming from @xmath390 , will give us the same response as on @xmath13 ( for @xmath176 in ( [ eq : diraccorm0 ] ) , as there expressions are written with respect to the standard minkowski vierbein ) .",
    "this part is independent of spin structure ( @xmath383 ) on @xmath14 .",
    "the fourth term , coming from @xmath391 , will also be independent of spin structure , as it contains only @xmath392 in both cases .",
    "thus the only way in which the transition rate may be sensitive to the spin structure on @xmath14 is through the cross terms , @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "however it is a reasonably straightforward matter to show that these traces are both @xmath80 on the trajectory ( [ eqn : m - trajdir ] ) , due to simple cancellations in the products of the wightman functions .",
    "thus we see , even without an explicit calculation on a specific trajectory , that the transition rate can not depend on @xmath383 , and so the detector is not sensitive to the spin structure , for _ any _ motion at constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately an explict evaluation of the transition rate on the inertial or uniformly accelerated worldlines , as on @xmath13 , is difficult to obtain and we shall not discuss it further here .",
    "in the recent literature deser and levin @xcite have presented kinematical arguments for the calculation of the hawking - unruh effects in a large class of black hole and cosmological spaces by mapping the trajectories of detectors in these spacetimes to rindler trajectories in higher dimensional embedding spaces ( known as gems , or global embedding minkowski spacetimes ) in which these spacetimes have global embeddings . in @xcite uniformly accelerated observers in de sitter and anti de sitter space are considered .",

    "is extended to schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter and reissner - nordstrm spaces in four dimensions and rotating btz spaces in three dimensions , and the methods of @xcite can be readily adapted to other cases .",
    "we note that indeed any einstein geometry has a gems @xcite .",
    "@xcite considers gems calculations on a large class of higher dimensional black holes , generalising the four - dimensional results of deser and levin ( and the results for the four - dimensional ads hole and others in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath19-dimensional schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom in asymptotically flat , de sitter and anti de sitter spaces are discussed .",
    "the case of four - dimensional asymptotically locally anti - de sitter is particularly interesting as solutions with planar , cylindrical , toroidal and hyperbolic horizon topology exist .",
    "the higher dimensional versions of these non - spherical ads black holes are also considered .",
    "their global embeddings in higher dimensional minkowski spaces are found and the associated temperatures and entropies obtained .",
    "other references on gems come from the group of hong , park , kim , soh and oh @xcite . these include the @xmath0-dimensional ads hole as mentioned above , static rotating and charged btz holes , @xmath398 de sitter holes , scalar tensor theories , charged dilatonic black holes in @xmath399 dimensions , charged and uncharged black strings in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , and a few other cases .",
    "a recent paper by chen and tian @xcite argues that the gems approach holds for general stationary motions in curved spacetimes .",
    "however these authors argue further that the approach in general fails for non - stationary motions .",
    "the example they use is that of a freely falling observer in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "we note here that although their argument does prove that the gems argument is not valid for some non - stationary trajectories by use of an example , it does not prove that the gems approach is useless for all such trajectories .    within the kinematical arguments employed in all the work reviewed above the great simplification in working with these gems",
    "is that we are mapping situations in curved spacetimes to corresponding ones in a flat spacetime , where calculations are always simpler , both conceptually and technically .",
    "it seems reasonable following the success of the gems programme that the responses of particle detectors in black hole and cosmological backgrounds could also be related in some way to responses of corresponding detectors in their gems .",
    "we note immediately that such a mapping of detector responses is clearly not trivial as we would expect different responses to occur due to the different dimensions which the spacetimes and their gems have , however some relation is still expected . in this section",
    "then we present an argument which should be relevant to the response of a static detector in the single exterior of the @xmath7 geon black hole ( and the kruskal spacetime ) via an embedding of the kruskal manifold into a @xmath15-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "this embedding space is different to the @xmath397-dimensional embedding of kruskal so far used in the gems literature @xcite , but we use it as it is more easily adapted to the @xmath7 geon .",
    "we begin by first presenting the embedding ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the complexified kruskal manifold @xmath400 here is considered to be an algebraic variety in @xmath401 . with",
    "coordinates @xmath402 and metric @xmath403 @xmath404 being the timelike coordinate , @xmath400 is determined by @xmath405 the lorentzian section of @xmath400 , denoted by @xmath406 , is the subset stabilised by @xmath407 , where @xmath408 stands for complex conjugation . @xmath406",
    "consists of two connected components , one with @xmath409 and one @xmath410 , both of which are isometric to the kruskal manifold , which we denote by @xmath411 .",
    "an explicit embedding of @xmath411 into @xmath406 with @xmath409 is given by @xmath412 with @xmath413 and @xmath414 defined as the unique solution to @xmath415 here @xmath416 are a set of usual kruskal coordinates , giving the usual kruskal metric on @xmath411 . in each of the four regions of @xmath411 , @xmath417",
    ", one can introduce as usual local schwarzschild coordinates @xmath418 . for @xmath419 , the transformation reads @xmath420 where @xmath421 , and the expressions for @xmath422 are as in ( [ eqn : z1toz7 ] ) while those for @xmath423 and @xmath404 become @xmath424 recalling that @xmath404 is the timelike coordinate in the embedding space , we see immediately that an observer static in the exterior region @xmath419 at @xmath425 is a rindler observer in the @xmath15-dimensional embedding space with @xmath426 constant and acceleration in the @xmath423-direction of magnitude @xmath427 as we have seen , the response of such a rindler detector in the embedding space is thermal with the associated temperature @xmath428 this gives the hawking temperature as seen by the static observer in the black hole spacetime .",
    "the associated black hole temperature , i.e. the temperature as seen at infinity , in the kruskal spacetime is given by the tolman relation @xmath429 ( [ eqn : localgemshawk ] ) and ( [ eqn : infgems hawk ] ) are the expected expressions on kruskal space @xcite .",
    "thus the black hole temperature as seen by a static observer has been derived from the unruh temperature seen by the associated rindler observer in the global embedding minkowski spacetime .",
    "next we consider the @xmath7 geon .",
    "this is built as a quotient of the kruskal manifold under the involutive isometry @xmath430 .",
    "we now extend the action of the group generated by @xmath431 to the @xmath15-dimensional embedding space @xmath400 in order to obtain a suitable embedding space for the geon .",
    "a suitable extension of @xmath431 is @xmath432 , which is an involution on @xmath400 .",
    "again the worldline of a static detector in the @xmath7 geon exterior @xmath419 is mapped to the worldline of a rindler observer with acceleration in the @xmath423-direction with magnitude ( [ eqn : accelembed ] ) in this embedding space .",
    "we suggest therefore that the calculations of the time dependent responses of an accelerated observer in the @xmath19-dimensional quotients of minkowski space , done in section [ sec : quotient ] , should have relevance to the response of a static detector in the exterior of the @xmath7 geon ( although the exact nature of the relationship is not clear ) . in particular if we specialise the results of section [ sec : quotient ] to a detector with uniform acceleration ( [ eqn : accelembed ] ) in the quotient of a @xmath15-dimensional minkowski space under involution @xmath433 we see that the response has two parts .",
    "the thermal time - independent part is given by ( [ thermal ] ) , which in the present case reads @xmath434 again this is a thermal response associated with a temperature @xmath435 .",
    "clearly the response is different to that of the static detector on kruskal due to the higher number of dimensions though the two should be related .",
    "the image part of the response for this rindler detector is , in the case of a detector switched on in the infinite past , @xmath436    the total response for certain values of the parameters is shown in figure [ fig : gemsgeon ] .",
    "the comments of section [ sec : autoacelmbound ] then follow .",
    "the image part consists of a term periodic in @xmath9 with period @xmath230 plus a term bounded by a function which dies off exponentially for large @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical evidence exhibits behaviour qualitatively very similar to that of figure [ fig : accel ] .",
    "the comments made in the section [ sec : autoacelmbound ] about finite time detections also follow here . in particular the oscillatory behaviour of the boundary part as",
    "@xmath266 is a property only of the case of infinite time detection . for a detector switched on at @xmath437 the transition rate oscillates for some time period with @xmath438 ,",
    "but eventually it will fall to the thermal response and so at late times the difference between the response on the minkowski space and that on the quotient space vanishes .",
    "that is , for instantaneous , exponential and gaussian switching the image term behaves qualitatively as shown in figures [ fig : finitetime ] , [ fig : finitetimewindow ] and [ fig : finitetimewindow2 ] , respectively .",
    "this implies for finite time static detectors on the @xmath7 geon the difference between the response there and that on kruskal spacetime falls off also to @xmath80 at late times , which is in agreement with the comments made in @xcite .",
    "note however the different behaviour in the case of the infinite time detection .",
    "in this section we begin in subsection [ sec - desit ] by considering a model detector in de sitter space . throughout we consider a conformally coupled massless scalar field moving through the euclidean vacuum @xcite . we see that here a similar situation is encountered to that found by schlicht for the uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski space .",
    "it is seen that in the case of a comoving detector switched on in the infinite past and off at finite @xmath9 , if the correlation function is regularized by a naive @xmath10-prescription , as for example is done in birrell and davies  @xcite , we are led to an unphysical , @xmath9-dependent response .",
    "we therefore introduce an alternative regularization .",
    "further , for a comoving detector , we show that such a regularization can arise also by considering a model detector with spatial extent , that is by considering a smeared field operator in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we recover the usual time independent thermal response for comoving and uniformly accelerated detectors .",
    "subsection [ sec : rp3 ] then considers comoving observers in @xmath7 de sitter space , such that the motion is orthogonal to the distinguished foliation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the thermal part seen in de sitter space , the transition rate contains an image part , related to that found in section [ sec : minkbound ] for a uniformly accelerated detector on a four - dimensional minkowski space with a planar boundary .",
    "we also address a comoving detector in de sitter and @xmath7 de sitter space in a gems approach , by considering the response of the associated uniformly accelerated detectors in higher dimensional minkowski ( with boundaries in the case of @xmath7 de sitter ) embedding spaces . as we are able to do the calculations both in the original curved spaces and in the global embedding spaces , the results help to clarify the relation and validity of relating detector responses to those in embedding spaces .",
    "we represent @xmath19-dimensional de sitter space as the hyperboloid @xmath439 embedded in the @xmath440-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath441 with @xmath442 real - valued coordinates .",

    "the transition rate ( [ eqn : desittrans ] ) is in two parts , a de sitter part and an image part .",
    "we have calculated already the de sitter part , coming from the first term in ( [ eqn : methoddesit ] ) , in section [ sec - desit ] .",
    "the result was the usual thermal , planckian , response at temperature @xmath109 .",
    "we need the image term . in order to find @xmath508 on this worldline",
    "we first write @xmath451 in terms of the coordinates @xmath509 of the embedding space and then act on @xmath452 with @xmath491 , finding @xmath510 where @xmath511 .",
    "the regularization has been omitted as the wordline and its image under @xmath491 are completely spacelike separated .",
    "the image term gives to the transition rate the contribution @xmath512    we see that the image term contribution ( [ eqn : imagerpdesit ] ) is exactly the same as the image term contribution in the response of a uniformly accelerated detector on a four - dimensional minkowski space with boundary at @xmath186 ( ( [ eqn : boundaryaccel ] ) with @xmath105 ) .",
    "therefore the total response of our inertial detector in @xmath7 de sitter space ( with ricci scalar @xmath513 ) is identical to the response of a uniformly accelerated detector travelling in four - dimensional minkowski space with a boundary at @xmath186 with the acceleration @xmath70 perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "it follows that our numerical results in figure [ fig : accel ] also give the response on @xmath7 de sitter space , with the appropriate interpretation for @xmath223 .",
    "in particular , the image term breaks the kms condition and the response is non - thermal and non - planckian .",
    "when the detector is switched on in the infinite past , the response at large @xmath9 is oscillatory in @xmath9 with period @xmath230 .",
    "when the detector is switched on at a finite time @xmath43 , @xmath514 , numerical evidence indicates that the response is approximately periodic in the region @xmath515 , with period @xmath230 , but it falls to the thermal response as @xmath266 , as discussed further in section [ sec : minkbound ] and illustrared in figures [ fig : finitetime ] , [ fig : finitetimewindow ] and [ fig : finitetimewindow2 ] .",
    "this clarifies and adds to the discussion given in  @xcite .",
    "we wish to compare these particle detector results in @xmath7 de sitter space to the asociated gems particle detector .",
    "we see from ( [ eqn : geodtraj ] ) that the gems worldline of interest is a rindler trajectory with acceleration @xmath516 in the @xmath16-dimensional embedding space .",
    "therefore in the @xmath16-dimensional minkowski embedding space of de sitter space we see that the response of a detector following this worldline is a thermal one with associated temperature @xmath109 and so we expect , as indeed we saw in section [ sec - desit ] , the response of the detector in de sitter space to also be a thermal one with temperature @xmath109 . again",
    "the actual responses of detectors in the two situations are not identical ( as seen in sections [ sec - linmink ] and [ sec - desit ] ) due to the different dimensions of the spaces , the most obvious difference being the presence of the planckian factor in the de sitter response and the fermi factor in rindler response on the odd dimensional embedding space . as the @xmath7 de sitter spacetime is built as a quotient of de sitter space under the map",
    "@xmath517 we have immediately the action of this map on the embedding space .",
    "the geodesic worldline of interest maps to a rindler worldline in this embedding space with acceleration @xmath516 , so in the gems approach we consider a rindler particle detector with this acceleration in this @xmath16-dimensional embedding space .",
    "the transition rate was found in section [ sec : quotient ] .",
    "the thermal part of the transition rate is constant in time and is given by @xmath518 corresponding to the temperature @xmath435 .",
    "the image part of the transition rate depends on the proper time and is given by @xmath519 the total response is shown for various values of the parameters in figure [ fig : gemsdesitter ] .",
    "the qualitative similarities to the @xmath7 de sitter transition rate are apparent .",
    "they provide evidence that , at least in some cases , the gems procedure may be applied to quotient spaces such as @xmath7 de sitter space and the @xmath7 geon where the embedding spaces are minkowski spaces with suitable identifications .",
    "in this paper we considered particle detector models in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "in particular we investigated the model of schlicht @xcite .",
    "the model is that of a monopole detector linearly coupled to a massless scalar field which is smeared with a window function in order to regularize the correlation function in the transition rate .",
    "we extended the regularization of the correlation function for the massless linearly coupled scalar field to @xmath19-dimensional minkowski space , and we showed that it leads to the expected responses for inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors switched on in the infinite past and off at @xmath520 .",
    "further we extended the regularization of schlicht to the massive scalar field in minkowski space and have shown that it reduces to that of @xcite in the massless limit .",
    "next we introduced a model of a linearly coupled massless scalar field detector on spacetimes built as quotients of minkowski space under certain discrete isometries . in a number of cases the model , when switched on at @xmath72 and read at @xmath520 , was shown to reproduce the known asymptotic responses .",
    "these cases include the uniformly accelerated detector on @xmath13 @xcite as well as the inertial and uniformly accelerated detectors on minkowski space with boundary when the motion is parallel to the boundary @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that our model is reasonable .",
    "further we presented a number of new responses , the most interesting of which are the time dependent responses on minkowski space with boundary and on @xmath14 .",
    "an inertial detector approaching the boundary on minkowski space with boundary was seen to react in a qualitatively similar way to one travelling parallel to the boundary but taking progressively smaller distances ( ie comparing figures [ fig : inertialparal ] and [ fig : inertialwl0 ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the detector approaching the boundary a divergence in the transition rate occurs as the boundary is reached .",
    "a detector with uniform acceleration perpendicular to the boundary was also considered , the results were seen to be more subtle and an interesting observation made . for a detector which is switched on in the infinite past the transition rate",
    "is found to oscillate in @xmath9 at late times with period @xmath230 , never tending to the minkowski thermal response , no matter how far from the boundary the detector gets in the future .",
    "however for a detector switched on at a finite time ( that is @xmath267 ) , the response will at late times tend to the thermal minkowski response . for instantaneous , exponential and gaussian switching functions",
    "the conclusion is the same .",
    "responses were also considered on the quotient spaces of minkowski space under the involution @xmath244 where @xmath245 and certain relations to the responses on minkowski space with boundary noted .",
    "the responses are relevent for discussions of detectors in the spacetime outside an infinitely long and zero radius cosmic string .",
    "the responses of uniformly accelerated detectors , where the motion is in the @xmath521 direction , are also relevant for the discussion of static detectors in the @xmath7 geon exterior as well as comoving detectors in @xmath7 de sitter via their global embedding minkowski spacetimes ( gems ) .",
    "next we extended the detector model and regularization to the massless dirac field .",
    "with a few minor technicalities the extension is quite straightforward .",
    "the transition rate and the power spectrum of the dirac noise for a detector switched on in the infinite past on inertial and a uniformly accelerated trajectories was obtained .",
    "the power spectrum for the accelerated detector agrees with the previous literature ( see e.g @xcite ) and so suggests our model is reasonable .",
    "further we briefly considered the response of the dirac detector on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "one aim was to see whether a uniformly accelerated dirac detector on @xmath14 could distinguish the two spin structures there .",
    "we found this not to be the case for our detector model .",
    "in section [ sec : geon ] we considered the response of a static detector in the exterior region of the @xmath7 geon via a global embedding minkowski space .",
    "although the gems programme has so far only been applied in a kinematical setting , our aim was to examine the possibility that the response of the detector in the embedding space is related to that in the underlying curved space and further whether the gems scheme can be applied to quotient spaces , such as the @xmath7 geon and @xmath7 de sitter space , where the embedding spaces are minkowski spaces with suitable identifications .",
    "we found that the response is related to that of uniformly accelerated detectors given in section [ sec : quotient ] .",
    "in particular it is shown in the embedding space , and expected on the geon , that the response is not thermal , in the sense that it does not satisfy the kms condition , for most times .",
    "further it is seen that for a detector switched on in the infinite past the response is approximately thermal at early times but does not return to the thermal response at late times in contrast to expectations ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "if the detector however is turned on at some finite time in the distant past then the response is approximately thermal when turned on and returns to being approximately thermal in the distant future .",
    "lastly we considered some responses on de sitter space and @xmath7 de sitter space .",
    "the regularization of @xcite is not easily adaptable to general motions in these spacetimes , due to the possibility of spatially closed hypersurfaces in the detector s rest frame .",
    "we argued however for a similar regularization by reinterpreting the regularization as an ultraviolet cut - off in the high `` frequency '' modes . on de sitter space the transition rate for a detector switched on in the infinite past",
    "is found for a uniformly accelerated detector , and it is found to agree with previous literature @xcite .",
    "this result suggests our regularization is reasonable . in the case of an inertial detector in de sitter space the regularization we introduced",
    "is shown to also come from the consideration of a detector with spatial extension where the detector is rigid in its rest frame .",
    "on @xmath7 de sitter space the response of a detector following the comoving worldline was considered in two ways .",
    "firstly a direct calculation showed that the response is exactly that of a uniformly accelerated detector approaching the boundary on minkowski space with boundary ( identifying @xmath70 with the acceleration ) .",
    "again therefore the response of a detector switched on in the infinite past has an oscillatory behaviour in the distant future and does not tend to the expected thermal result , the image term breaking the kms condition , in contrast to what was expected @xcite .",
    "the response of a detector switched on at a finite time does however tend to the expected thermal response at late times .",
    "secondly we considered the same calculation from the gems perspective .",
    "although the response is clearly different to that in the original space , due to the different dimensions of @xmath7 de sitter space and the embedding space , it is seen that the response is qualitatively very similar .",
    "the calculation therefore provides a good example for investigating the relation between detector responses in curved spacetimes and those in their gems , and the use of the gems procedure on such quotient spaces where the embedding spaces are minkowski spaces with suitable identifications .",
    "the calculation further suggests that the response found in the gems of the @xmath7 geon in section [ sec : geon ] is indeed closely related to the response of the static detector in the geon itself .",
