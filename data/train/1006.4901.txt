    "x - ray observations of edge - on spiral galaxies revealed the existence of hot gas at temperatures of @xmath6 10@xmath7 k extending a few kpc beyond the disk ( e.g. @xcite ) . the origin of energy and material in such a hot halo has not been clarified .",
    "feedback from supernovae ( sne ) as galactic wind or fountain and heated primordial gas are possible candidates @xcite . in any cases ,",
    "halo gas plays important roles in galactic evolution through chemical circulation and interaction between galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",
    "the hot gaseous halo in and around the milky - way has been investigated for a long time .",
    "for instance , rosat all sky survey ( rass ) quantitatively mapped the spatial distribution of the soft x - ray background emission ( sxb ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) component extrapolated from the discrete hard x - ray sources could explain only about half of the sxb , leaving the soft x - ray emission below 1 kev being of a diffuse origin . with the high resolution x - ray microcalorimeter flying on a sounding rocket",
    ", @xcite detected emission lines of hydrogen- and helium - like oxygen , neon , and iron ions from about 1 steradian of the sky , which suggests that the emitting gas is of a thermal nature and at temperatures of t@xmath8 k. the existence of the hot gas in and around the milky - way is consistent with the _ chandra _ observations of nearby edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "however , because these emission data carry very little distance information , the properties of the global hot gas , like its density , temperature , and their distributions , are still poorly understood .",
    "a combined analysis of high resolution absorption and emission data provides us with a powerful diagnostic of properties of the absorbing / emitting plasma .",
    "absorption lines measure the column density of the absorbing material , which is an integration of the density of the absorbing ions along a sight line .",
    "in contrast , emission line intensity is sensitive to the emission measure , which is proportional to the density square of the emitting plasma . thus , a combination of the emission and absorption data naturally yields the density and the size of the corresponding absorbing / emitting gas .    with significantly improved spectral resolution of current x - ray instruments ,",
    "we are now able to observe the needed high resolution absorption and emission lines produced in the hot plasma . for instance",
    ", the x - ray absorption lines at @xmath9 , in particular the helium- and hydrogen - like o and o lines , are detected in spectra of many galactic and extragalactic sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite find that the o absorption line can always be detected in an agn spectrum as long as the spectrum is of high signal - to - noise ratio . on the other hand , the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) aboard _ suzaku",
    "_ can also resolve emission lines produced in a diffuse emitting plasma at temperatures of t@xmath8 k. and indeed , the o and o lines have been detected in nearly all directions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a systematical study of emission lines of the hot gas in and around the galaxy has been conducted by @xcite , who report the o and o lines in 14 blank sky observations with the xis and conclude that the line - of - sight mean temperatures of the emitting gas has a narrow distribution around @xmath10 k. since the ion fractions of o and o and their k - transition emissivities are very sensitive to gas temperature at @xmath11 k , a combined analysis of these emission and absorption lines will also constrain the gas temperature and its distribution without the complexity of relative chemical abundances of metal elements .",
    "although this combined analysis method has long been applied in the ultraviolet wavelength band @xcite , its application in the x - ray band just began . complementing the high resolution absorption data observed with _",
    "chandra _ with the broadband emission data obtained with rass , @xcite firstly attempted to conduct the combined analysis in the x - ray band to infer the hot gas properties in our galaxy .",
    "they also proposed a model for the galactic disk assuming the temperature and density of the hot gas fading off exponentially along the vertical direction .",
    "they concluded that the o and o absorption lines observed along the mrk  421 sight line are consistent with the galactic disk origin . @xcite",
    "further constrained this disk model by jointly analyzing the high resolution absorption data obtained with _",
    "chandra _ along the lmc  x-3 sight line and emission data observed with _",
    "suzaku _ in the vicinity of the sight line .",
    "they estimated gas temperature and density at the galactic plane and their scale heights as 3.6 ( + 0.8 , @xmath120.7 ) @xmath13 k and 1.4 ( + 2.0 , @xmath121.0 ) @xmath14 @xmath3 and 1.4 ( + 3.8 , @xmath121.2 ) kpc and 2.8 ( + 3.6 , @xmath121.8 ) kpc , respectively .",

    "we checked the column density of the neutral oxygen in the sun - lit atmosphere in the line of sight during the selected gtis , and excluded the exposures when the column density is larger than @xmath20 @xmath21 to avoid significant neutral oxygen emission from earth s atmosphere @xcite .",

    "the first one is the solar wind flux ( fig.[fig : lightcurve ] ) .",

    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have revealed that the intensities of x - ray emission from extended hot gas decreases exponentially as a function of height from the galactic plane . as a next step in our analysis",
    ", we employed another simple model to fit the data : an exponential distribution model ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this model , the density @xmath125 and temperature @xmath61 of the hot gas are distributed according to the following equation , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the vertical distance from the galactic plane , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the density and temperature at the plane , and @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the scale heights of the density and temperature , respectively , and @xmath145 is the filling factor , which is assumed to be 1 in this paper .",
    "thus the equivalent hydrogen column density of the hot gas ( @xmath48 ) is calculated as @xmath146 .",
    "the models _ vabmkl _ and _ absem _ can also be used in an exponential disk model using the additional parameter @xmath147 ( see @xcite for detailed description ) .",
    "we therefore used the same model as used in the uniform model here ( model c2 ) . for fit parameters , for convenience we used the column density @xmath48 instead of @xmath141 .",
    "we jointly fitted the emission and absorption data using this exponential disk model .",
    "the parameters obtained are summarized in table 7 .",
    "we first fixed the velocity dispersion ( @xmath43 ) at 290 km s@xmath23 .",
    "we next examined the robustness of the temperature ( @xmath148 ) , column density ( @xmath149 ) , and scale height ( @xmath150 ) , as a function of @xmath147 , @xmath43 , and the intensity of foreground swcx intensity .",
    "we found that all parameters are consistent to within 90% statistical errors .",
    "when we fitted with @xmath43 allowed to vary freely , the best - fit value of @xmath128 became 54@xmath151 km s@xmath23 .",
    "though this is above the thermal velocity ( @xmath6 30 km s@xmath23 ) , it is a smaller value than that obtained from the absorption spectrum which determined the ratio between the ovii k@xmath28 and k@xmath29 lines . in the exponential disk model ,",
    "low ( @xmath152 k ) temperature plasma can exist in the outer regions , which contribute only to the ovii absorption line .",
    "this might cause the smaller @xmath43 value .",
    "the cooling time of such low temperature plasmas is very short , and the actual situation will not follow such a simple exponential model in this temperature range .",
    "we therefore fixed @xmath43 at 290 km s @xmath23 , as the best - fit value from the absorption analysis .",
    "confidence contours of @xmath150 , @xmath148 and @xmath48 versus gamma are plotted in figure 7 , over - laid on those of the lmc x-3 direction @xcite .",
    "we then obtained the scale height for the temperature gradient as @xmath153 kpc and the gas density at the galactic plane as @xmath154 @xmath3 ( figure 8) .",
    "this values is typical for the mid - plane plasma density @xcite .",
    "as the high temperature plasma close to the galactic plane can emit fe and ne lines efficiently , the spectrum can be fitted without an abundance of heavy element higher than the solar value .",
