    "the net effect is a re - projection of the primary anisotropies at last scattering , which induces a correlation between different modes : because of gravitational lensing , the anisotropy power seen on a given angular scale is no longer due to a single cosmological mode , but rather to a set of those on a finite interval of scales which have been projected on that angle .",
    "+ this has a number of effects on the cmb observables @xcite .    * in total intensity , the lensing smears out the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , and adds power in the arcminute scale , where the primordial anisotropies decay naturally because of diffuse damping from thomson scattering at decoupling . the relative changes @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents the anisotropy power on a scale @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath3 degrees , is of the order @xmath4 on degree and tens arcminute scales , but diverges in the arcminute and sub - arcminute , as represented in figure [ fig:1 ] . * in polarization",
    ", an additional effect occurs due to the leaking of the e modes into b ones . in the primary cmb anisotropies",
    ", the e modes are sourced by all kinds of cosmological perturbations , i.e. density , velocity and gravitational waves , while the b ones are excited by the latter two species , only .",
    "the lensing represents a second order effect in cosmology , having the cosmological perturbations in the large scale structures acting as lenses on the background cmb anisotropies .",
    "along with the re - projection effect mentioned above , the lensing also mixes e and b modes ( see the insert in figure [ fig:2 ] ) . since in the primordial perturbations one",
    "has e@xmath5b , the net effect is perceived as a leaking of the e modes into b due to gravitational lensing @xcite . in the angular power spectrum , the b lensing modes peak at ten arcminute scale , corresponding to @xmath6 , resembling the primary e modes in shape , about @xmath7 times smaller .",
    "the lensing b signal is a fundamental prediction of the structure formation process , both in distribution of the angular power and amplitude , which may vary by a few ten percent level @xcite depending on the dark energy abundance .",
    "finally , the lensing affects the statistics of the cmb anisotropies , injecting a finite non - gaussian power which is determined by the same correlation between scales .",
    "the non - gaussian lensing power manifests itself in a bispectrum power which is predictable and may be connected with the most relevant cosmological parameters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "in particular , if the cmb acts as a source , the lensing cross section peaks at @xmath8 , with a width of about @xmath9 .",
    "the latter epoch corresponds to the one in which the dark energy becomes dominating with respect to the non - relativistic matter .",
    "the lensing of the cmb can be a probe of the dark energy abundance at the epoch of equality with matter .",
    "the lensing is sourced by cosmological structures , growing at a rate which is tightly related to the value of @xmath10 , the hubble expansion rate , at each time .",
    "the latter , through the friedmann equation , is determined by the matter abundance , which is fixed at all times if its value is known today , and the dark energy one , which may vary according to the behavior of its equation of state . * in summary",
    ", the cmb lensing probes @xmath10 at about @xmath11 , and so the dark energy abundance at the same epoch , being therefore complementary to the existing dark energy observables , mainly sensitive to its abundance at the present epoch . * it was shown @xcite that within the present constraints on the value of the dark energy equation of state at the epoch of equality with matter , the amplitude of the bb modes presents variations of the order of @xmath4 , which might be probed by the forthcoming experiments detecting the lensing distortion in the arcminute and sub - arcminute scale of cmb anisotropies .",
    "primary polarization is generated during the last scattering process and possesses a characteristic scale corresponding to the angle subtended by the horizon at recombination . at later times , free electrons in the intergalactic medium of in clusters",
    "re - scatter cmb photons , causing secondary polarization . in the presence of dark energy , the gravitational potentials possess a time derivative which is different from zero due to the onset of acceleration , causing the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "the latter is due to the net redshift or blueshift acquired by photons passing through evolving cosmological structures , i.e. collapsing over - densities or expanding voids as the photons cross them .",
    "thus , the free electrons in clusters are hit by an anisotropic incident radiation , originated in part by the one present at last scattering , i.e. due to the primary anisotropies , and in part by the isw effect .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the quadrupole component in the incident intensity distribution contributes to most of the polarization signal .",
    "+ in addition , a local kinematic quadrupole arises from the cluster peculiar motion .",
    "the relevance of this process for dark energy is that the isw quadrupole component is enhanced by the change in the cosmological equation of state due to the onset of acceleration .",
    "the primary quadrupole as well as the kinematic one represent unwanted contaminant for the effect induced by the isw above . while the primary quadrupole is indistinguishable from the one induced by cosmological structures , the kinematic effect in clusters , due to the motion of free electrons with respect to the cmb frame , has a characteristic spectral dependence which provides with a potential method to disentangle the two polarization effects .",

    "the polarization effect depends linearly on the optical depth @xmath12 which has to be determined through an ensemble average .",
    "all other possible polarization effects associated with clusters are not additive so that the sum of the signals from individual clusters will tend to smooth out their contribution .",
    "the polarization intensity depends on the frequency and therefore measurements in different bands must be carried out and provide an opportunity to separate signals of different nature .",
    "indeed , cosmologically induced cluster polarization signals can be affected by a strongly polarized cluster compact source .",
    "the polarization pattern in this case is similar to that produced by the effect of finite optical depth , @xmath13 @xcite and its frequency dependence ( a power law ) makes this signal easy to recognize .",
    "the unscattered polarization anisotropies , coming from the last scattering along the line of sight of a given cluster under consideration do not represent a significant contaminant , as they are damped on the angular scales of the cluster cores .",
    "moreover , faraday rotation measures of galaxy clusters are too small to produce a significant depolarization for wavelengths below 10 cm . on the other hand ,",
    "high resolution observations are mandatory to single out the sources within the clusters and subtract them .",

    "detection of diffuse polarized dust emission has been carried out by @xcite and indicates a 3 - 5 % polarization on large angular scales and low galactic latitude . at higher latitudes the polarization fraction may increase due to the smaller averaging over different layers of the galactic gas emitting in polarization .",
