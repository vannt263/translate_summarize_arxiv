    "the production of a prompt photon in association with a heavy - quark jet provides us with the opportunity to study the structure of the proton and the nucleus as well as the mechanisms of heavy quark energy loss .",
    "the information obtained depends on the collision type .    * for @xmath0 collisions ( at the tevatron )",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this process is sensitive to the charm / bottom pdf , and therefore can provide information and constraints on the presence of intrinsic charm / bottom ( ic / ib ) in the proton @xcite . * in @xmath1 collisions ( at rhic and the lhc ) @xmath2 production can be used to constrain the gluon nuclear pdf ( npdf ) , @xcite , which presently carries a large error to it , as will be shown in more detail in section [ sec : pa ] .",
    "one should underline that knowing the precise npdfs is necessary for obtaining reliable predictions in @xmath3 collisions . * in @xmath3 collisions",
    "the study of prompt photons and heavy quarks provides an ideal tool for investigating the energy lost by heavy partons in the hot medium ( section [ sec : aa ] ) . as an electromagnetic probe the photon",
    "is expected to traverse the medium unaffected and thus gauge the quenching of the energy of the heavy - quark jet .",
    "furthermore , the comparison between @xmath4 and @xmath5 production provides access to the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss .",
    "( 480,140)(0,0 ) ( 15,-15 ) ( 220,130 )    unlike the pdf for a gluon inside a free proton , the nuclear gluon pdf is largely unconstrained due to the dearth of available data .",
    "currently , only the nmc structure function data ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) impose weak constraints on the gluon npdf in the @xmath9-range @xmath10 production at rhic . ] , so that a precise determination is not possible . this large uncertainty in @xmath11",
    "is presented by the nuclear modification factor to the gluon npdf , @xmath12 , in fig.[fig : npdf]a ) where a comparison between the different nuclear pdf sets currently available ( ncteq @xcite , hkn07 @xcite , eps09 @xcite ) is shown .",
    "fig.[fig : npdf]b ) furthermore shows different fits with equally good @xmath13 , whose spread represents a lower limit on the uncertainty associated with the ncteq set .",
    "the need for measurements of processes sensitive to the gluon npdf is evident .",
    "here we point out that @xmath2 production is an excellent probe of @xmath11 , and can serve as one such process , as evidenced by fig.9 and fig.10 in ref .",
    "fig.9 shows the differential cross - section for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16  tev for @xmath17 collisions at alice emcal acceptances .",
    "the anticipated event rate ( before experimental efficiencies ) is sufficiently large for a measurement ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . in fig.10",
    "the subprocess contributions to @xmath20 are presented , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the dominant ones ; for more details see ref .",
    "the sensitivity to the gluon npdf further shows up in the nuclear modification factor to the cross - section , @xmath23 in fig.[fig : rxseclhc]a ) , when compared to @xmath24 in fig.[fig : rxseclhc]b ) .",
    "it can clearly be seen by juxtaposing fig.[fig : rxseclhc]a ) and fig.[fig : rxseclhc]b ) that @xmath25 follows closely @xmath26 in the region of @xmath9 probed at the lhc for each npdf set . therefore we can conclude that this process is an excellent candidate for constraining the gluon nuclear distribution as a measurement of the prompt photon + heavy - quark jet process with appropriately small error bars will be able to distinguish between the three different npdf sets .",
    "the study of two - particle final states in heavy - ion collisions provides a much more versatile access to quantifying the energy loss in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , as compared to the study of a single inclusive process .",
    "this is further the case if one of the final - state particles is medium insensitive , in particular the study of @xmath28_jet _ @xcite or @xmath29_hadron _ @xcite correlations helps to evaluate the amount of quenching experienced by jets as they traverse the medium while the photon s energy serves as a gauge of the initial parton energy . here , the focus on the associated production of @xmath28_heavy - quark jet _ can help clarify the energy loss in the heavy quark sector .",
    "currently , due to the dead cone effect a definite hierarchy of the energy loss is expected , @xmath30 , with the heavier quarks losing less energy @xcite .",
    "this hierarchy remains to be clarified experimentally , and prompt photon + heavy - quark jet production is a natural and promising process for this verification .    in fig.[fig : cross - secel]a ) we show the effects of the medium on the leading order ( lo ) differential cross - section versus @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the energy loss of the heavy quark , @xmath33 , is computed on an event by event basis , with the use of the quenching weight obtained perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the following parameters describing the medium have been used @xmath34",
    "gev/@xmath35 and @xmath36  gev .",
    "the effects show up in the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "and @xmath39 at low @xmath40 is due to experimental cuts .",
    "] however , we need not limit ourselves to only one - particle observables as the information obtained by investigating the correlations of the two final state particles ( e.g. photon - jet energy asymmetry , momentum imbalance , photon - jet pair momentum @xcite ) provides a much better handle on the amount of energy loss . in fig.[fig : cross - secel]b ) we focus in more detail on the differential cross - section as a function of the photon - jet pair momentum , @xmath41 . at lo accuracy , for the direct contribution",
    "one has @xmath42 , whereas for the fragmentation contribution the shift between the @xmath43 spectrum in vacuum versus the one in medium is given by @xmath44 . unfortunately when one investigates two - particle observables for this process at lo ,",
    "only the fragmentation contributions in medium and in vacuum can be compared , as due to the kinematic constraints the direct component in vacuum is non - zero only when @xmath45 . in fig.[fig : raa ] the fragmentation contributions in medium to @xmath14 and @xmath15 normalized to the @xmath46 case are shown . clearly @xmath47 at small @xmath43 , while as @xmath43 grows the difference disappears , as the quenching weight depends on @xmath48 , which becomes similar for charm and bottom quarks at large @xmath43 .",
    "however , definite conclusions can only be drawn after a study at nlo accuracy @xcite .",
    "prompt photon + heavy - quark jet production has proven to be an extremely useful and versatile process .",
    "it can be employed to constrain the heavy quark pdfs in hadron - hadron collisions , while measurements in @xmath1 collisions can help constrain the gluon npdf . in heavy - ion collisions",
    "it can help estimate the quenching experienced by a heavy - quark jet , while also providing access to the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss .",
