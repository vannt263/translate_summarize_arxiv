    "large - scale structures such as clusters of galaxies are very over - dense compared to the average density of the universe .",
    "it is believed that these were formed by the growth of small perturbations via gravitational instability @xcite . in general",
    ", the equations that describe the growth of density perturbations due to gravitational clustering @xcite can not be solved analytically when the over - densities are large and one has to rely on n - body simulations for detailed predictions .",
    "limited information about non - linear gravitational clustering can be obtained by using approximations or ansatze , e.g. , stable clustering @xcite for which it is assumed that the infall velocity and hubble velocity compensate for each other leading to a stable configuration .",
    "stable clustering allows us to relate the initial spectrum of fluctuations with the final asymptotic spectrum of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "non - linear scaling relations are a more detailed prescription for relating the initial and final spectrum of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying non - linear scaling relations is to understand key phases in gravitational clustering , and to identify the relevant process in each phase @xcite .",
    "existence of non - linear scaling relations implies that gravitational clustering does not erase memory of initial conditions .",
    "this provides another useful and a more prosaic motivation for studying scaling relations , namely to be able to make predictions about clustering of galaxies for a given power spectrum @xcite .",
    "scaling relations can also be used to make predictions for weak lensing observations in a given model @xcite .",
    "these scaling relations are valid for hierarchical models where the initial conditions contain fluctuations at all scales and the amplitude of fluctuations increases monotonically as we go from large - scales to small - scales .",
    "non - linear scaling relations indicate that there are three prominent regimes in evolution of gravitational clustering . when the amplitude of perturbations is small so that the density contrast ( @xmath2 ) is close to zero ( @xmath3 ) , mode coupling is not important and the evolution closely follows the predictions of linear perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum and correlation function evolve without a change in shape in the linear regime . as the density contrast grows and becomes comparable to unity ,",
    "motions induced by gravitational collapse start to dominate over the expansion of the universe .",
    "the quasi - linear regime is dominated by infall onto density peaks and the correlation function grows rapidly in this phase @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse leads to formation of structures in or close to dynamical equilibrium and further evolution of density contrast is dominated by depletion of average density due to expansion of the universe as the density of collapsed structures remains almost constant .",
    "we shall call this the asymptotic regime .    initial conditions with power law power spectra",
    "are very useful for such studies .",
    "these power spectra have the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the index of the power spectrum .",
    "we require @xmath6 for hierarchical clustering and n - body simulations can be used for only this type of models , indeed even for these models there are restrictions on the size of the simulation box in order for the simulation to reproduce the model correctly @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 is the number of spatial dimensions in which gravitational clustering is being studied .",
    "if we consider an einstein - desitter universe then such a model is characterised by the scale of non - linearity @xmath8 and the index @xmath5 , where @xmath8 is defined as the scale at which rms fluctuations in linearly extrapolated density contrast ( @xmath9 ) is unity .",
    "@xmath10 if the evolution of clustering is self - similar then the non - linear correlation function plotted as a function of @xmath11 should have the same shape at all epochs for a given index @xmath5 .",
    "note that the evolution is expected to be self - similar if @xmath8 is the only scale in the problem and it is not expected in cosmologies with non - zero spatial curvature or a non - power - law expansion factor .",
    "several studies have attempted to understand the nature of the asymptotic regime , mainly with help of n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "key conclusions of these studies about the asymptotic regime may be summarised as follows .",
    "* stable clustering is not reached in the range of non - linearities explored by n - body simulations .",
    "however , the departure from stable clustering for most models is small .",
    "* gravitational clustering does not erase memory of initial conditions , i.e. , the non - linear power spectrum is not independent of the linear power spectrum to the extent it could be probed . there is no _ universal _ asymptotic regime .",
    "one of the reasons for the inability to resolve the problem of asymptotic regime has been the limited dynamic range of n - body simulations .",
    "the problem of dynamic range can be circumvented by simulating a two - dimensional system instead of a three - dimensional one , wherein a much higher dynamic range can be achieved with similar computational resources @xcite .",
    "generic features like non - linear scaling relations are likely to be independent of dimension and  in fact  the scaling relations in the quasi - linear regime were predicted @xcite well before these could be tested in simulations @xcite .",
    "if we can understand the nature of the asymptotic regime in two dimensions , it will help us solve the problem in three dimensions even if we can not map the solution directly to the full problem in three dimensions .",
    "previous studies of gravitational clustering in two dimensions concluded that there is no stable clustering @xcite .",
    "both the studies mentioned above were limited to @xmath1 and the dynamic range in the non - linear regime was limited compared to the present study ( see eqn.(6 ) for the definition of @xmath12 ) . in this work",
    "we revisit the same issues , but using the 2d treepm code @xcite for n - body simulations .",
    "the treepm code has a better force resolution as compared to a pm code , therefore in our simulations we have a significantly larger dynamic range over which we can study the asymptotic regime .",
    "a related issue is that of density profiles of haloes surrounding galaxies and clusters .",
    "non - linear scaling relations in the asymptotic regime depend on the kind of dynamical equilibrium that is reached in massive haloes , if an equilibrium is ever reached . under the assumption of self - similar collapse , the density profiles of massive haloes can be related to the initial conditions , and also to the dynamics within these haloes @xcite .",
    "if these models are true then the slope of density profile at small scales is related to the index of power spectrum as : @xmath13 if self - similar collapse of haloes is the correct description then the final density profile of a halo carries information about the initial profile and hence about the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that gravitational clustering in hierarchical models leads to a _ universal _ density profile @xcite",
    "irrespective of the initial conditions , we shall refer to this density profile as the nfw profile .",
    "@xmath14 here @xmath15 is a scale radius .",
    "we will also use the term @xmath16 for this .",
    "this profile is characterised by a @xmath17 decline at large radii and a cuspy inner profile of the form @xmath18 .",
    "the claim of universality has been tested in several studies @xcite and though there are disagreements , it appears that the nfw profile is _ consistent _ with the density profiles of massive haloes in n - body simulations even if it is not the best fit .",
    "this essentially implies that there is a scatter in density profiles and one can fit different functional forms to the n - body data @xcite .",
    "if true , the existence of nfw like profile implies that there are some universal aspects of gravitational clustering in an expanding universe .",
    "there is no _ ab initio _ derivation of the nfw profile , but one can argue that if there is a universal profile it should have same asymptotes as the form shown above @xcite .",
    "we briefly review non - linear scaling relations in the following section .",
    "numerical simulations used in the present work are discussed in  3 .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "in this section we review the non - linear scaling relations for gravitational clustering in two dimensions . the non - linear and the linear correlation functions at two different scales can be related by non - linear scaling relations @xcite .",
    "the relation between these scales is given by the characteristics of the pair conservation equation @xcite under the assumption that the pair velocity function @xmath19 ( see below ) depends on @xmath20 and @xmath21 through @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "for the two dimensional system of interest , this equation can be written as @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the ratio between mean pair velocity and hubble velocity .",
    "the volume averaged correlation function is defined as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the correlation function .",
    "the characteristics of this equation are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the two scales used in non - linear scaling relations .",
    "the self - similar models @xcite imply that for collapse of cylindrical perturbations the turn - around radius and the initial density contrast inside that shell are related as @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the linearly extrapolated mean correlation function . noting that in two dimensions mass enclosed in a shell @xmath32 , we find @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] in the regime dominated by infall .",
    "thus in 2-d the scaling relations are @xmath34 the usual stable clustering limit is @xmath35 where the infall and hubble expansion balance each other in structures in dynamical equilibrium . in such a case , or for any value of @xmath19 that does not depend on the initial conditions , slope of the non - linear correlation function is a unique function of the slope of the initial correlation function . for a general @xmath19 we can relate the slope of the correlation function in the asymptotic regime to the slope of the initial linear correlation function @xmath36 if , however , @xmath37  constant then the non - linear correlation function has the same slope _",
    "independent of the initial correlation function .",
    "_ this will happen if gravitational clustering erases all memory of the initial conditions .",
    "note that this will make @xmath19 , and hence the velocity fields a function of the initial conditions .",
    "in our earlier work we had concluded that @xmath38 in the asymptotic regime @xcite . in the same work we confirmed the prediction for the infall dominated quasi - linear regime",
    ", we found that the index in this regime is indeed @xmath39 .",
    "( note that in 3d , the indices for three regimes are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . ) in this work , we shall , among other things address the following two questions :    * does the asymptotic value of @xmath19 scales with @xmath5 such that @xmath43  constant ?",
    "if it does , then the final slope of the non - linear correlation function will be independent of the initial slope .",
    "we will show that this does not happen .",
    "* does @xmath19 reach a universal value independent of @xmath5 ?",
    "this seems to be the case and we will show that the behaviour of @xmath19 is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "but since all simulations , including this one probes only up to finite @xmath26 , its actual asymptotic value is difficult to determine .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the nature of scaling relations in the asymptotic regime . we choose to work in two dimensions in order to improve the dynamic range over which the results of n - body simulations are reliable .",
    "we wish to do this without changing the system completely as the ultimate goal is to carry over the understanding to three dimensional systems .",
    "therefore we study the evolution of two dimensional perturbations in a three dimensional expanding universe @xcite .",
    "we start with a set of infinitely long straight `` needles '' all pointing along one axis .",
    "the evolution keeps the `` needles '' pointed in the same direction and we study gravitational clustering of these needles in an orthogonal plane .",
    "particles in the n - body simulation represent the intersection of these `` needles '' with this plane and the force of interaction between `` particles '' is given by the solution of the poisson equation in two dimensions .",
    "the inter - particle force falls as @xmath44 , unlike the inverse square force in three dimensions .",
    "we use the two dimensional treepm code @xcite , a modified version of the three dimensional treepm code @xcite .",
    "the treepm code splits the interaction force into two parts , the long range force is computed in fourier space and the short range component is computed in real space .",
    "the treepm code does not use the usual pm force as the long range force , this allows us to control errors in force over the entire range of scales @xcite .",
    "we soften the two - dimensional gravitational force at small scales in order to ensure _ collisionless evolution _ of the particle distribution in our simulations .",
    "we use a cubic spline form for softening , i.e. , each particle is assumed to have an extended mass distribution represented by the normalised spline kernel used in the sph formalism .",
    "this softens the force at scales smaller than the softening length @xmath45 , and at scales larger than @xmath45 we get the full @xmath44 force .",
    "all n - body simulations reported in this paper used @xmath46 in units of the average inter - particle separation .",
    "we have carried out a series of numerical simulations with power law initial spectra with indices @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "several realisations of each power spectrum were simulated .",
    "scatter in values across this suite of simulations was used to estimate the error bars .",
    "it is difficult to reach the asymptotic regime for @xmath50 before the perturbations at the box scale become important and hence we have not used models with a more negative index .",
    "models were normalised so that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the wave number of the fundamental mode , essentially the fluctuations at @xmath53 of the box size were normalised to unity at @xmath54 .",
    "simulations were run upto a sufficiently late epoch while requiring that the fluctuations at half the box scale were well within the linear regime at the final epoch , i.e. , @xmath55 .",

    "density profiles of very massive haloes are easier to study as these extend over a large region , large compared to the softening length which is the smallest scale we can resolve in our simulations .",
    "we identified haloes in our simulations using the method of density peaks @xcite . in this method the density field is smoothed at a large length scale @xmath113 grid lengths and peaks in the smoothed density field are identified .",
    "particles within a distance @xmath114 of a peak are selected and we find the centre of mass for these particles .",
    "we now select a smaller set of particles out of these , those that are within @xmath115 from the centre of mass and compute the centre of mass .",
    "these iterations continue till we are left with only a small number of particles , say about @xmath116 .",
    "the final centre of mass is taken to be the centre of the halo and the density profiles are plotted as a function of distance from this centre . we apply two further criteria :    * central density contrast of the halo must be very large , @xmath117 . *",
    "haloes and their neighbourhood should be smooth and there should be no major merger going on . to implement this in an objective manner we compute the ratio @xmath118 where average is over all particles within the central region of the halo and @xmath119 is the position angle of a particle from the centre of mass .",
    "we require @xmath120 for a halo to be used for density profiles .",
    "these two criteria reject about @xmath121 of all the haloes with rejection being more frequent for models with a larger index @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig_denprofiles ] shows the density profiles of haloes that satisfy these criteria in our simulations .",
    "density profiles of a large number of haloes are plotted , for each halo we have drawn density @xmath122 as a function of @xmath108 , where @xmath16 is the scale at which the density is @xmath123 times the average .",
    "average density is unity in these simulations .",
    "it is clear that there is a large scatter in density profiles .",

    "the distribution of the inner slope of density profiles is very broad , as is obvious from the range .",
    "the median @xmath109 is approximately @xmath130 for @xmath47 and @xmath131 for @xmath61 .",
    "self - similar , spherical collapse predicts an inner slope of @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath47 and @xmath74 , respectively ( eqn.(2 ) ) .",
    "these values are well within the scatter of inner slopes .",
    "clearly , the answer lies in between the prediction for the self - similar collapse and a universal slope .",
    "it is difficult to explain the large scatter seen in density profiles .",
    "the origin of scatter can lie in environmental dependence as well as in different formation histories for haloes .",
    "we can , however , address the issue of the small systematic shift in median slope as compared to that expected from stable clustering .",
    "transverse motions can affect the density profile of massive haloes in a significant manner @xcite .",
    "such effects will be stronger if the transverse motions are stronger , and as is obvious from the fig .",
    "[ fig_pairvt ] transverse motions are stronger for larger @xmath5 .",
    "rotation is playing a more important role in models with more substructure and is leading to flatter density profiles .",

    "the stable clustering limit requires formation of objects that are in dynamical equilibrium . following peebles ( 1980 )",
    ", we compute the second time derivative of the moment of inertia and set it to zero for a cluster of particles in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "this gives us the condition to be satisfied for dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we get : @xmath137 where the sums are over all particles and dots denote time derivatives .",
    "particles are located at @xmath138 and have velocities @xmath139 and @xmath140 is the mass of the @xmath141th particle .",
    "thus the kinetic energy depends _ only on the total mass of the halo .",
    "_ if the massive haloes that we are studying here are in virial equilibrium then the kinetic energy @xmath142 for these haloes should be proportional to @xmath135 .",

    "[ fig_vir ] .",
    "it is clear that these quantities are correlated even though there is a large scatter about the average relation .",
    "thus we may conclude that the massive haloes are close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the basic motivation for this work was to improve our understanding of non - linear scaling relations for two dimensional gravitational clustering .",
    "previous studies @xcite established the behaviour for the quasi - linear regime , but could not probe the nature of the asymptotic regime .",
    "we used the 2d treepm code @xcite which allows us to study the non - linear regime in far greater detail , as compared to the pm code used in earlier studies .",
    "the results of our study can be summarised as follows :    * the evolution of the correlation function for power - law models is scale invariant up to the highest non - linearities reached in our simulations .",
    "* we reproduce the results of earlier studies in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "we confirm that the slope of the non - linear scaling relation in this regime is close to @xmath39 , as predicted on the basis of the infall dominated growth model @xcite .",
    "* we do not find any difference in the non - linear scaling relation for different power law models .",
    "thus the information about initial conditions is retained even in the extremely non - linear regime . * the stable clustering limit ( @xmath143 as @xmath144 ) is not reached .",
    "( though it is generally claimed that stable clustering with @xmath145 is a _ natural _",
    "asymptotic state , it has been shown that the davis - peebles scale - invariant solution @xcite and the hierarchical model for the three - point function are inconsistent with the standard stable - clustering picture @xcite .",
    "this , of course , is for gravitational collapse in three dimensions . )",
    "this can be concluded from the slope of the correlation function , pair velocity , as well as density profiles of massive haloes . *",
    "pair velocities in the asymptotic regime are smaller than expected from the stable clustering model .",
    "this does not imply that massive haloes are evaporating . *",
    "the transverse component of pair velocity is more significant for models with a larger spectral index , i.e. , for models with more substructure .",
    "this suggests that gravitational collisions between substructure orbiting within haloes are responsible for generating coherent transverse motions .",
    "* we find that there is no universal density profile for massive haloes in two dimensional gravitational clustering .",
    "there is a large scatter in inner as well as outer slopes of density profiles .",
    "median value of the inner slope is different for different models , though the difference is much smaller than the scatter in values .",
    "tests show that these clusters are close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "* the difference in the median inner slope for different models is smaller than expected from self - similar spherical collapse .",
    "we argue that the difference in significance of transverse motions for different models is responsible for this change .",
    "many of the conclusions listed here have been checked independently in large pm simulations ( @xmath57 particles ) up to @xmath146 .",
    "further work is required to test our hypothesis that gravitational collisions between substructure are responsible for generating coherent transverse motions .",
    "we are carrying out a detailed study using numerical simulations where we tune the amount of substructure to test this proposal .",
    "considerable work has been done to study the non - linear scaling relations in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "we intend to study these again in light of insight developed using tests in clustering in two dimensions .",
    "it has been shown that the scaling relations for gravitational clustering in three dimensions depend on the initial spectrum of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the origin of this index dependence and test whether substructure plays a role in this .",
    "the transverse pair velocity function has been introduced in eqn.([geqn ] ) , we are studying the three dimensional equivalent of this quantity in order to probe the role of transverse motions in gravitational clustering in the full three dimensional problem .",
