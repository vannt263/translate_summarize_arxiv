    "the simple random walk is a venerable problem , finding its applications in many areas of statistical physics . despite its long history , novel aspects continue to surface .",
    "motivated by recent experiments on gas transport properties in polycarbonate films , in which polymers are found in a glassy state , we are led to the the following question .",
    "suppose the polymers are modeled by the usual ( non - interacting ) random walks on a lattice , how many `` monomers '' can we expect on each bond ? clearly , the answer will depend on both the length and the density of the polymers .",
    "not surprisingly , it is a simple step once we know the distribution of bond - traverses of a _ single _ polymer ( or random walker ) .",
    "remarkably , this distribution is not , to the best of our knowledge , in the literature .",
    "this note will be devoted to our findings of such a distribution .",
    "let a simple random walk start at the origin of a @xmath8-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "we wish to know the average number of bonds @xmath0 that it has traversed exactly @xmath1 times .",
    "this quantity satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average total number of distinct bonds traversed by ( also known as the support ) the walk .",
    "if for @xmath3 asymptotically @xmath11 , then one may reasonably expect that in that limit @xmath0 can be expressed as a scaling function of @xmath12 .",
    "the sum rules ( [ sumrules ] ) then imply that @xmath0 takes the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a scaling function .    in this note",
    "we will explicit find @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 ) in spatial dimensions @xmath5 and @xmath7 , thereby justifying the scaling form eq.([scaling ] ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath14 is an error function `` erfc '' in @xmath5 and an exponential in @xmath7 . in @xmath7",
    "we determine , moreover , the leading order correction to the scaling behavior ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "in order to determine @xmath0 we need the following notation . let the vector @xmath16 denote any of the @xmath8 basis vectors of the lattice .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the bond between the sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the fact that this bond is identical to @xmath20 is of no importance ) .",
    "let @xmath21 be the probability that @xmath17 is traversed exactly @xmath1 times , irrespective of the direction . then @xmath22 where each bond occurs exactly once in the summation .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 may be calculated by an adaptation of the analogous method for multiple visits to the same _ site _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be the probability that the first traversal of @xmath17 occurs at the @xmath2th step , with @xmath24 it is convenient to set @xmath25 .",
    "for any @xmath26 defined for @xmath27 we may introduce the generating function @xmath28 let furthermore @xmath29 be the probability that , given a traversal has taken place , the next one occurs exactly @xmath30 steps later , with @xmath31 then @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 reasoning in a similar way as for the site problem one finds that @xmath34 \\,[1-\\hat{r}(z)]\\,\\hat{r}^{m-1}(z ) \\qquad ( m=1,2,\\ldots )   \\label{relbf}\\ ] ] here the function @xmath35 , which implies @xmath36 , still have to be found",

    ", we have to consider each spatial dimension separately .",
    "in dimension @xmath5 we have to evaluate eq.([inverse ] ) with @xcite @xmath62 it turns out to be advantageous to consider the differences @xmath63 .",
    "after slight rewriting this yields @xmath64\\,\\big[1-\\sqrt{1-z^2}\\big]^m \\label{intdifference}\\ ] ] we will now fold the integration path around the branch cut that runs from @xmath65 to @xmath66 along the positive real axis . in the limit @xmath3",
    "we expect a meaningful result only if also @xmath67 at fixed ratio @xmath4 .",
    "we anticipate that in this limit the integral on @xmath68 draws its main contribution from a region at a distance of order @xmath69 from the branch point at @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore introduce the scaling variable @xmath70 and the scaled variable of integration @xmath71 the integrand of eq.([intdifference ] ) may now be expanded in powers of @xmath69 at fixed @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to @xmath74 where the two terms on the right hand side come from above and below the branch cut , respectively .",
    "the integral is easily found to be equal to @xmath75 . with the boundary condition @xmath76 we therefore find upon integrating @xmath77 which is the final result , valid for @xmath3 at @xmath78 fixed . when summing eq.([final1 ] ) on @xmath1 ( or alternatively when evaluating the integral obtained by summing eq.([inverse ] ) on @xmath1 ) , one obtains @xmath79 . together with eq.([final1 ] ) this confirms the validity of the hypothesized scaling form ( [ scaling ] ) .    in order to compare the large time scaling behavior of @xmath0 to its finite time forms we have performed monte - carlo simulations . for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 the bond distribution",
    "was averaged over several independent runs .",
    "fig.1 shows that for increasing values of @xmath2 the simulation data rapidly converge to the scaling function , and they are practically indistinguishable on this figure for @xmath83 .",
    "for a two - dimensional square lattice the expansion @xcite @xmath84 enables one to evaluate eq.([inverse ] ) for @xmath2 asymptotically large .",
    "the only integral whose asymptotic behavior we need is @xcite @xmath85   \\label{integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is euler s constant .",
    "we anticipate a meaningful result for @xmath3 if also @xmath67 in such a way that the ratio @xmath87 remains fixed .",
    "we expect that in this scaling limit the @xmath68 integral will draw its main contribution from a region in the complex plane near the branch point @xmath65 where the ratio @xmath88 is finite . keeping this in mind we expand the integral ( [ inverse ] ) for @xmath0 as @xmath89   \\label{intexpansion}\\ ] ]",
    "we may now insert in ( [ intexpansion ] ) the explicit expression @xmath90 , knowing that the @xmath91 terms in the expansion of @xmath57 will contribute only terms with higher powers of @xmath92 to the final asymptotic series .",
    "the exponential in eq.([intexpansion ] ) may then be expanded , the resulting series integrated term by term with the aid of eq.([integral ] ) , and summed again . upon introducing the scaling variable @xmath93",
    "one finds the final result @xmath94 \\label{final2}\\ ] ] valid for @xmath95 at @xmath96 fixed . as expected , the correction terms decay only as powers of the inverse logarithm of the number of steps .",
    "the next few higher order terms in the asymptotic series ( [ final2 ] ) may be calculated without great effort .",
    "since the @xmath97th order correction term is multiplied by a @xmath97th degree polynomial in @xmath96 , this is actually an expansion in powers of @xmath98 .",
    "one may verify that eq.([final2 ] ) satisfies the sum rules ( [ sumrules ] ) up to and including the first order correction term .",
    "the scaling function @xmath14 introduced in eq.([scaling ] ) here appears to be a simple exponential .",
    "one finds that the average total number of bonds traversed increases as @xmath99 .",
    "fig.2 compares simulation data for @xmath100 to the theoretical scaling law ( the first term of eq.([final2 ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath80 data are also compared to the exact curve , which we obtained by taylor expanding eq.([bmz ] ) through the one hundredth term with the aid of a symbol manipulation program .",
    "for @xmath101 the scaling law plus leading correction ( the first two terms of eq.([final2 ] ) ) is also displayed . upon collapsing the data of fig .",
    "2 one finds fig .",
    "3 , which shows that in @xmath7 the convergence to the asymptotic scaling law is very slow .",
    "we conclude this note with a series of comments and remarks .",
    "an alternative route to @xmath0 is to consider a complementary process , by focusing on a _ particular _ bond in , say , a finite periodic @xmath102 lattice .",
    "now , we can ask how often this bond is traversed by a @xmath2-step random walk which starts at @xmath103 and ends at @xmath18 . by summing over @xmath104 and invoking translational invariance",
    ", we obviously access @xmath0 . in this approach",
    ", we can easily generalize the problem to a study of the frequency of traversing in only _",
    "one direction .",
    "_ to solve both problems , consider a modified random walker , for which the rate of traversing our chosen bond is @xmath105 instead of @xmath106 .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath111 , is precisely @xmath112 .$ ] with the extra factor @xmath8 , the quantity @xmath113 represents nothing but the total number of bonds in the lattice .",
    "interestingly , this @xmath114 contains an extra term ( @xmath115 ) which carries the information on the bonds _ never _ traversed .",
    "so , @xmath116 $ ] is just @xmath117 . for completeness ,",
    "we report the result for unidirectional traverses : @xmath118 } .\\ ] ] finally , note that finite size effects are fully incorporated in this approach , although they are implicitly `` buried '' in @xmath119 ^{-1}$ ] ( where the sum is over the set @xmath120 of allowed @xmath102 wavevectors ) .",
    "needless to say , generalizations to strip- or slab - like samples ( @xmath121 ) are straightforward .",
    "thus , it is possible to study the crossover of our distributions , at least in principle , when the polymer length exceeds the shortest dimension significantly ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "physically , ultra - thin membranes made from extra - long polymers can be manufactured .",
    "until they become reality , however , it may not be worthwhile to extend our analysis to this class of crossover behavior .",
    "a second remark concerns the statistics of multiple _ visits to sites _ , as opposed to traversals of bonds .",
    "visits have been of considerable interest in the literature ( see hughes @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "the average number @xmath123 of sites visited exactly @xmath1 times by a @xmath2 step random walk was studied by montroll and weiss @xcite and by barber and ninham @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 limit at fixed @xmath1 was considered by hughes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in @xmath5 and by montroll and weiss @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in @xmath7 ; however , the scaling limit expression of @xmath123 has not to our knowledge appeared in the literature .",
    "since the analysis of @xmath123 runs exactly parallel to that of @xmath0 , we content ourselves to state the results here .    in dimension @xmath5 the average number of sites visited @xmath1 times is , to leading order in the scaling limit , equal to the average number of bonds visited @xmath1 times : @xmath124 for @xmath3 at @xmath78 fixed . in dimension @xmath7 one",
    "has in terms of the scaling variable @xmath125 @xmath126   \\label{resultv2}\\ ] ] valid for @xmath3 at @xmath127 fixed .",
    "comparison of eqs.([resultv2 ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) shows that to leading order @xmath123 and @xmath0 are identical up to a coefficient and a scale factor ; however , the coefficients of the first correction terms are different .",
    "the leading order relation between @xmath123 and @xmath0 in @xmath128 is heuristically clear as follows . given a large number @xmath1 of visits to an arbitrary site @xmath18 , there will have been typically @xmath129 traversals , starting from @xmath18 , of a specific bond @xmath130 .",
    "now the same bond will have been traversed , typically , the same number of times in the opposite direction .",
    "so for each site visited @xmath1 times , there are @xmath8 bonds traversed @xmath131 times .",
    "although we have not shown so explicitly , the scaling function in @xmath7 is expected to be universal , _",
    "i.e. _ lattice structure independent . in dimensions",
    "@xmath132 the random walk is transient and it is easy to show that as a consequence in the large @xmath2 limit @xmath133and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are nonuniversal . for random walks that are not simple ( _ i.e. _ have a step size distribution not limited to nearest neighbor steps ) , bond traversals are not unambiguously defined .",
    "however , visits to sites still are , and for such walks @xmath123 is readily calculated by the present method .",
    "one case of interest is the scaling limit of @xmath123 for lattice lvy flights ( also called riemann walks ) @xcite , for which the distribution of step sizes decreases as a power law .",
