    "as we knows , neutron stars may be created in the aftermath of the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star at the end of its life , or may be created when the mass of a accreting white dwarf exceed the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the typical character of neutron stars may be described as following : spinning rapidly , often making several hundred rotations per second ; having a small stature with a radius @xmath1 of @xmath2 km and a heavy avoirdupois with a mass @xmath3 on the order of 1.5 solar masses @xmath4 ; and having a very compact central density as high as several times the nuclear saturation density .",
    "neutron stars are one of the densest forms of matters in the observable universe .",
    "+ one of the important global property of neutron star is the moment of inertia @xmath5 .",
    "eary estimates of the moment of inertia by the energy -loss rate from pulsars spanned a wide range of @xmath5 @xcite , and several researchers have given a lower bound on the moment of inertia of the pulsar as @xcite @xmath6 .",
    "recently , kalogera@xcite etc . also studied the bound of the moment of inertia . in order to investigate the general relativistic frame dragging effect on the moments of inertia of neutron stars ,",
    "the moments of inertia of the non - rotating and rotating at the kepler frequency neutron stars will be studied in this work .",
    "+ here we adopt the metric signature - + + + , g = c=1 .",
    "in relativity , the space - time geometry of a static spherical symmetric star can be described as @xmath7 and the space - time geometry of a rotating star in equilibrium is described by a stationary and axisymmetric metric of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the local inertial frame and is proportional to the star s rotational frequency @xmath10 , which is the uniform angular velocity of the star relative to an observer at infinity .",
    "+ from the @xmath11 component of einstein field equations , accurate to the first order in @xmath10 , one gets@xcite @xmath12 where@xmath13^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , @xmath14 , which denotes the angular velocity of the fluid relative to the local inertial frame .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed as @xmath15 at the center , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is chosen arbitrarily . integrating eq.(3 )",
    "outward from the center of the star , one would get the function @xmath18 . outside the star , from eq.(3 )",
    "one has @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total angular mementum of the star , which takes the form@xcite @xmath21 , where @xmath1 is the surface radius of the star . according to the traditional definition , we have @xmath22 where @xmath5 is the moment of inertia . at the neutron star s surface , in term of eqs.(3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) , one can get @xmath23 from the ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) components of einstein field equations to the static spherically symmetric star , one gets@xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 accurate to the first order in @xmath10 , substituting eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) into eq .",
    "( 5 ) , one has@xcite @xmath26 this is just the approximate expression of the moment of inertia accurate to the first order in @xmath10 . to the non - rotating neutron stars , @xmath27 . as a first order approximation",
    ", it is means that there is only consideration of the frame dragging effect and without consideration of the deformation caused by the rotation@xcite . according to eq.(8 ) , we can estimate that , to the same neutron star , the moment of inertia of the non - rotating star will be bigger than that of the rotating star , which will be testified in our later numerical calculation .",
    "this is just the frame dragging effect to the moment of inertia .",
    "approximating in week field , according to eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , one gets @xmath28 in newtonian theory , @xmath29 , so from eq.(5 ) , we have @xmath30 this is just the calculating expression of the moment of inertia of a spherical symmetric star in newtonian theory .",
    "+ similar to the newtonian theory , in general relativity , we also define the radius of gyration of a spherical symmetric star as @xmath31",
    "there are several models to deal with the superdense matters , such as non - relativistic models , relativistic field theoretical models@xcite . to different models ,",
    "the fractions of particles in the superdense matters are different , and then the bulk properties of superdense matters are different , that is , the eos of them are different@xcite . in this work ,",
    "two kind of eos will be employed@xcite , one is for the traditional neutron stars ( tns ) , in which @xmath32 are the main elements ; the other is for the hyperon stars ( hs ) , in which @xmath33 are the main elements . the eos will be considered in the relativistic @xmath0 model@xcite .",
    "fig.(1 ) shows the eos of the ths and hs .",
    "+    by using above eos and eqs.(8 ) and ( 11 ) , the moments of inertia and radii of gyration of neutron stars were calculated .",
    "fig.(2 ) presents the moment of inertia of non - rotating and rotating ( at the kepler frequency ) neutron stars as a function of central density .",
    "it is clear that , because of the frame dragging effect , as a first order approximation , the moments of inertia of the non - rotating tns ( or hs ) are bigger than that of the corresponding rotating stars at the same central density . from this figure , one can also see that , with the same central density , as the star rotating at its kepler frequency , the frame dragging effect on the moment of inertia of tns is bigger than that of hs .",
    "the reason of this is that the eos of tns is stiffer than the eos of hs , so there is a bigger kepler frequency of tns at the same central density , and then corresponds a bigger frame dragging effect . in order to show the frame dragging effect of the moments of inertia entirely , we present them in a three - dimension figure , fig.3 just presents the moments of inertia of tns as a function of the central densities and the central angular velocities relative to the local inertial frame .",
    "+    fig.4 gives the radii of gyration of non - rotating and rotating ( at the kepler frequency ) neutron stars as a function of central density . from this figure",
    "one can see that , to the same central density , there is a big gap between the lines of the non - rotating and rotating stars , that is to say , there is a remarkable frame dragging effect to the radii of gyration , and as the central density increasing , the effect increases .",
    "we also present the radii of gyration of tns in a three - dimension figure , see fig.5 .",
    "+ from our calculation , one can see that to a star at the same central density , the frame dragging effect will diminish its moment of inertia and radius of gyration , and as the star rotates faster , the dragging effect will become more obviously .",
