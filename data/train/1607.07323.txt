    "magnetic reconnection is a plasma phenomenon where a rapid rearrangement of magnetic fields of opposite polarity leads to the dissipation of the magnetic energy into heat , plasma kinetic energy and particle acceleration . in particular ,",
    "magnetic reconnection is generally regarded as a mechanism to account for the fast ( i.e. much shorter than the dynamical time - scale ) and intense variability observed in many astrophysical environments , like active galactic nuclei @xcite and pulsar wind nebulae @xcite .",
    "it is also likely to occur in space environments like solar flares and coronal mass ejection @xcite .",
    "a measure of the conversion of magnetic energy into particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection in earth s magnetosphere is reported in a recent paper of @xcite . finally , magnetic reconnection is responsible for sawtooth crashes that prevent the magnetic confinement in laboratory fusion experiments , such as tokamaks @xcite .",
    "the general features of steady state magnetic reconnection are described by the theory of sweet - parker @xcite , that proposed reconnection taking place in current sheets ( localized regions of very intense currents where non - ideal effects become important ) of length @xmath4 and thickness @xmath5 . in this model",
    "the reconnection time scales as @xmath0 ( where @xmath6 , is the lundquist number , @xmath4 is the characteristic length of the field configuration , @xmath7 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath8 is the resistivity ) .",
    "however , considering that the lundquist number is very large in space , astrophysical and laboratory plasmas ( e.g. @xmath9 in the solar corona and @xmath10 in tokamaks , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the above mentioned scaling yields reconnection time - scales that are several order of magnitudes longer than observed . an attempt to solve this problem",
    "was suggested by petschek @xcite , whose model yields a logarithmic dependence of the reconnection rate on @xmath1 .    petschek - like configuration and scaling are found in a recent relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of @xcite .",
    "however , this regime was never observed in laboratory experiments .",
    "the understanding of this time - scale problem was significantly improved using resistive mhd numerical simulations with large lundquist number .",
    "two - dimensional simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that when @xmath11 ,    the current sheet is subject to secondary tearing instability @xcite , resulting in the fragmentation of the current sheet and formation of a large number of plasmoids .",
    "this leads to the so called `` fast reconnection '' regime , where the reconnection rate becomes independent of the resistivity .",
    "recent three - dimensional mhd simulations @xcite have further shown that 3d instabilities can trigger a `` fast reconnection '' regime even for @xmath12 .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider both 2d and 3d resistive mhd simulations of magnetically confined cylindrical plasma columns ( see fig .",
    "[ plasma_column ] ) featuring a current ring where the azimuthal component of magnetic field changes polarity .",
    "this field configuration was considered in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "we consider two initial equilibria : one in which radial force balance is established by a thermal pressure gradient and one in which the field is force - free .",
    "the former can become unstable to pressure - driven instabilities while the latter is prone to the onset of current - driven modes .",
    "we then show that the presence of 3d plasma column instabilities results in a fragmentation of the initial current sheet and leads to a `` fast reconnection '' regime also for @xmath3 .",

    "the formation of plasmoids leads to the fragmentation of the initial circular sheet into multiple small - sized current sheets . during this stage ,",
    "the decay rate increases sharply , and becomes independent of @xmath1 , revealing the transition to a regime of fast reconnection .",
    "* eventually , the continuous formation and merging of plasmoids results in the random orientation of fragmented current - sheets that closely resemble the turbulent reconnection described by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* the rate of dissipation of magnetic energy during the fast reconnection regime is @xmath119 , consistent with previous numerical results of 2d reconnection .    in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * similar to the 2d runs , the magnetic energy ( during the initial phase ) is dissipated at a rate which is consistent with sweet - parker scaling , @xmath156 .",
    "* at later times the plasma column becomes unstable to either pressure - driven or current - driven instabilities ( depending on the initial equilibrium configuration ) , the onset of which does not depend on the lundquist number . in runs with same set of parameters ( @xmath75 and @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the 3d pressure - driven instability starts before the 2d secondary tearing mode .",
    "the growth of these instabilities causes the fragmentation of the original current ring into smaller secondary current sheets ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3dff ] ) .",
    "* at this time an increased magnetic dissipation is observed ( phase ii ) .",
    "the dissipation rate becomes independent of @xmath1 and is of the order of @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipationpb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipationff ] ) . *",
    "the dissipation rate starts to become independent of @xmath1 for @xmath159 , a threshold value which is an order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained from 2d runs .",
    "we point out that the dissipation rates reported here result from the interplay between magnetic reconnection and the turbulence induced by the instabilities arising in each configurations .",
    "this may lead to energy dissipation rates that are faster than the actual reconnection rate and could explain the differences between our findings ( @xmath160 ) and the results reported in previous reference studies ( @xmath161 ) . on the other hand , three - dimensional simulations without magnetic shear , that are not expected to develop magnetic reconnection , do not show relevant dissipation . in summary , we find that the 3d instabilities alone dissipate the magnetic energy inefficiently . however , they play a major role in enhancing the rate of magnetic dissipation in presence of reconnection .",
    "we emphasize that the lundquist numbers for the above 3d simulations lie in the range @xmath162 and no formation of secondary tearing instability is observed .",
    "the `` fast reconnection '' regime is , therefore , a mere effect of the 3d instabilities .",
    "a similar effect was reported in recent 3d simulations by @xcite , where they attributed the early fast reconnection regime to an unspecified 3d instability .",
    "our detailed analysis obtains consistent results in a different configuration ( magnetically confined plasma column ) and provides clear evidence that the onset of `` fast reconnection '' is triggered by well - known plasma instabilities ( pressure- or current - driven ) .",
    "our results can be relevant in the context of mhd jets , where these instabilities are likely to operate .",
    "typical astrophysical environments are active galactic nuclei , microquasars and pulsar wind nebulae . here",
    ", magnetic reconnection has been recently invoked as an efficient mechanism to accelerate particles to non - thermal energies @xcite up to pev energies @xcite .",
    "plasma instabilities in jets , therefore , could trigger fast magnetic reconnection episodes @xcite that may account for the observed fast variability and non - thermal features in these astrophysical scenarios , like , e.g. , the @xmath93-ray flares from the crab nebula @xcite , or the very rapid variability , @xmath163 10 min , detected , e.g. , in pks 2155 @xcite and pks 1222 @xcite .",
    "our results can , however , be applied only in the reference frame of the jet as no velocity shear has been considered . besides , a more detailed analysis would require direct investigation of particle acceleration .",
    "these issues will be explored in forthcoming studies .",
