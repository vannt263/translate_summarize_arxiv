    "for instance , the spin crossing at 2.8  t can show a level repulsion if a @xmath89 term is present , while a @xmath88 term is effective in raising the doublets degeneracy .",
    "consequently , there is a potential to split and identify all the resonance fields and their transition probabilities that enter eq .",

    "we studied the effect of the dm coupling on the value of the resonance fields and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath90  k. the second value ( 0.1  k ) is somewhat large when compared to previous studies @xcite based on low - temperature magnetization reversal curves ( dm estimated at 0.05  k ) in order to show its effect .",

    "the simulations show a small effect but opposite to the measured behavior [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ] in that the resonance fields are increasing with temperature instead of decreasing .",
    "the effect is orders of magnitude smaller if one replaces @xmath89 with @xmath88 ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath89 has to be sufficiently small ( up to @xmath6710 mk ) or even nonexistent such that its effect on resonance fields is negligible ( since it is opposing the observed behavior ) .",
    "a similar conclusion is drawn for the @xmath88 component or for a situation when the exchange couplings between the triangle s corners are not identical @xcite .",
    "both of these cases would generate satellite transitions , and we do not observe such signals within the experiment resolution ( a few milliteslas ) .",
    "this behavior and the discussed effect of an anisotropic coupling @xmath91 persist for any angle @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , we consider in the following no dm coupling and isotropic @xmath22 , in which case the seven resonance fields are all equal and varying the angle @xmath51 has no effect on the resonance fields .",
    "thus , we can further simplify the hamiltonian by taking @xmath92 .     and @xmath93 @xmath10 factors obtained from the angular dependences shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for seven temperatures .",

    "thermal variations in the @xmath10 factor are sometimes quite sharp , indicating magnetic or structural transitions , as is the case for some organic conductors @xcite or for cu and mn spins in nh@xmath9cl ( see refs . ) .",
    "the decrease of temperature can alter the local symmetry of @xmath100 orbitals in the v ions , thus altering their energy splittings . using first- and second - order perturbation theory ,",
    "this is demonstrated @xcite to induce a variation of the anisotropic @xmath10 tensor in the case of anisotropic orbitals .",
    "the smooth decrease in the @xmath10 components below @xmath6730 - 40  k is suggestive of changes in the molecular structure of the v@xmath6 anion at a local length scale or of an ensuing phase transition involving a long - range lattice order .",
    "no earlier study down to 30 mk has observed any long - range ordering ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the observed @xmath10 value thus clearly indicates that there is a change in the local molecular geometry which could be due to the onset of short - range correlations in the lattice .",
    "our report on the possibility of such local ordering might be of significance in understanding the spin dynamics below 30 k.    also , it is important to note that the effect of a small dm coupling can easily be absorbed into a small decrease of the @xmath10 factor .",
    "for instance , even if one considers a very large dm vector of size 0.35  k , the @xmath10 factors would have to decrease by only @xmath101 to accommodate it ( not shown ) . as mentioned above , such large values of the dm vector",
    "would not be justified , and any dm coupling would induce effects opposed to the measured temperature dependence of the resonance fields .",
    "consequently , it is more suitable to consider the dm vector as being equal to zero and to use the @xmath10 factor values given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we present a determination of the spin hamiltonian parameters of v@xmath6 , a prototypical molecular magnet which has gained a large amount of interest recently .",
    "angular - variation and temperature - dependence studies have been carried out on a precisely oriented single crystal .",
    "these measurements show that the anisotropic component of the dm vector is @xmath102  k , smaller than earlier estimates .",
    "also observed are significant changes in the @xmath10 tensor at temperatures below 30 k , possibly indicating local order .",
