    "what is the _ quantumness _ of a single physical system ?",
    "this question , that goes back to the foundations of quantum mechanics , has become of  practical \" importance with the advent of quantum information processing .",
    "there are a number of tasks in computation and communication that can be performed only if quantum resources are available .",
    "this is the case , for example , when nonclassical states of light are employed in communication or metrology @xcite , or when mathematical models can be simplified beyond classical limits by tailored quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of paramount importance to put on firm quantitative terms the often elusive concept of quantumness .",
    "there are many different aspects of quantumness .",
    "for instance , quantumness is revealed in the form of nonlocality by the violation of bell s inequality or in the form of contextuality by the kochen - specker test @xcite .",
    "however , it involves two parties , and it is a quantumness that is manifested in the correlation between them .",
    "we are interested in the quantumness of a single system , that involves many aspects and approaches . here",
    ", we shall focus on non - commutativity .",
    "it is usually stated that the main difference between quantum and classical physics is that quantum observables do not commute while all their classical counterparts do . in other words , some properties of quantum systems",
    "can not be specified simultaneously .",
    "well known examples are the position and the momentum of any quantum particle , or the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spin components of a spin-1/2 particle",
    ". however , quantum observables are only half of the picture .",
    "there are also quantum states ( density operators ) .",
    "classical states , on the other hand , are simply - speaking probability distributions . in other words ,",
    "all classical states commute with one another , while quantum states in general do not ( quantum states , being hermitian operators , are after all also observables ) .",
    "can quantumness , therefore , be thought of as the degree of non - commutation of quantum states ?",
    "how is it possible to quantify this concept in an operational way amenable of an experimental implementation ?    in this article we would like to relate the quantumness of a system to the non - commutativity of its accessible states , i.e. , the states that the said system can be prepared into .",
    "however , it turns out that it is more suitable to look at anticommutators of states rather than their commutators .",
    "the reason is that the most basic quantum experiment is to interfere two different states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the interference fringes depend on the quantity @xmath4 $ ] , which is the same as half of the trace of the anticommutator of the two states , @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the main result of our paper will be that it is always possible ( except for very special cases ) by repeated measurements of anticommutators ( and only anticommutators ) to reveal any underlying quantumness .",
    "a properly defined interferometer will allow to detect the quantumness encoded in a given system .",
    "although we speak of the quantumness of a single physical system , in practice we will need two or more copies of the physical system to witness the quantumness , as is almost always the case for other approaches . finally , we show that our witness is deeply linked to quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "before we show this , we first set the scene by introducing a formal definition of quantumness .",
    "we shall focus for simplicity on finite - dimensional systems and their algebra of observables @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the following two statements are equivalent  @xcite : given any pair @xmath7 , @xmath8=xy - yx=0 ; \\label{classicalc } \\\\ &   x\\geq 0 , y\\geq 0 \\ ; \\longrightarrow \\ ; \\{x , y\\}= xy + yx \\geq 0 . \\label{classicala } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , if the symmetrized product of two positive observables can take negative values , the algebra of observables is non - abelian and the system is quantum .",
    "this motivated the notion of  quantumness witness \"  @xcite , that was experimentally tested in  @xcite .",
    "quantum states are non - negative hermitian operators . therefore the characterization   can be extended to _ states _ as well and with many far reaching consequences .",
    "this is the main objective of this work .",
    "consider a protocol by which an observer is given two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , without knowing whether they commute .",
    "assume that can only perform interference experiments and therefore can only extract information about _ _",
    ". can understand that the two states do not commute ( and therefore that the system is quantum ) ?",
    "notice that the equivalence between and pertains to the _ whole _ algebra and not to any given two operators .",
    "in other words , @xmath9\\neq 0 $ ] does not imply in the least that @xmath10 can take negative value .",
    "consider for example two qubits in states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 is positive definite if @xmath14 .",
    "when a qubit can be prepared in states @xmath15 and @xmath16 that do not commute but satisfy this condition , the anticommutator ( first - order interference experiment ) does not bring quantumness to light .",
    "however , can perform interference experiments of _ any _ order , so that can in principle obtain information about repeated measurements of any anticommutators , such as @xmath17 and any ( arbitrary ) order of nested anticommutators ( see fig .",
    "[ swap ] for a possible scheme ) .",
    "the main result of this article is a theorem that proves the following statement : given any two states of a system , it is possible to bring to light quantumness by _ only _ looking at the available anticommutators .",
    "the scheme to be discussed in this article is of general validity .",
    "however , it is best suited for two of states whose commutator is  significantly \" nonvanishing . since states are normalized to one , this yields a natural scale for their commutator and provides quantitative meaning to the above expression  significant . \"",
    "the commutator of two states can vanish when the states are either parallel ( namely , they admit a common eigenbasis ) or orthogonal ( their spans do not overlap ) . in both cases",
    "their anticommutator can be of no help . in the former case",
    "the two states are  classical \" with respect to each other and no quantumness can be brought to light ( their anticommutator being always positive ) . in",
    "the latter case interference will vanish ( and so will the anticommutator ) .",
    "this motivates the question : what happens when the commutator is very small ( in the aforementioned natural scale ) ?",
    "one expects that in such a case to unearth quantumness ( nonpositivity of the anticommutator ) requires significant resources",
    ". we shall consider such subtle cases in the appendices .",
    "the fact that states should neither be parallel nor orthogonal suggests that the ideas explored here could be related to unambiguous state discrimination @xcite and probabilistic cloning @xcite .",
    "our strategy will be the following . we shall first observe ( theorem [ thm:1 ] ) that if one of the two states is pure , one anticommutator suffices to bring quantumness to light .",
    "therefore pure states are privileged and presumably quantumness will be easier to detect for states that are  close \" to pure states .",
    "we shall then observe ( theorem [ thm:2 ] ) that any mixed state , as long as its maximum eigenvalue is not degenerate , can be made arbitrarily close to a pure state by iterating anticommutators for a finite number of times .",
    "the proof is an application of familiar statistical - mechanical concepts .",
    "finally , theorem [ thm:3 ] will show that the anticommutator of any two states that are sufficiently close to ( non - orthogonal , non - parallel ) pure states is not positive definite",
    ". our result will be valid for qudits of any dimension .",
