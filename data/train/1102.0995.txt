    "the gravitational waves are tensorial fluctuations in the metric of spacetime .",
    "this particular perturbation is not explicitly coupled with the energy density and pressure of the matter of the universe and does not contribute to the gravitational instability that generates the cosmological structures we see today . on the other side his study is of great interest because it supplies the specific signature of the metric theory of gravity .",
    "nevertheless , they must have left special signatures in the polarization of the cmb anisotropies @xcite . moreover , since the gravitational waves were generated in the early universe , before the time of last scattering of cmb photons , they can be a window to the primordial phase of evolution of the universe .",
    "these waves are predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity , but they still have to be directly detected .",
    "great efforts are been done in this sense and there is hope that a new generation of experiments in space may allow this detection in some years @xcite . the gravitational waves spectrum frequency extends over a wide range of interest , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 to @xmath9 . ] , depending of the sources that generate those waves .",
    "many works have been made in order to identify specific signatures of cosmological models in the spectra of gravitational waves , for example , in the case of quintessence model @xcite and string cosmology @xcite .",
    "the existence of a classical scalar field in the nature has been considered in many theories of gravitation that present alternatives to general relativity .",
    "the prototype of scalar - tensor theories is the brans - dicke theory @xcite , whose lagrangian is given by @xmath10\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a scalar field that couples to gravity through the parameter @xmath6 , called brans - dicke parameter and @xmath12 is the matter lagrangian .    the brans - dicke theory , as others scalar - tensor theories , can be formulated in the einstein or in the jordan frames , which are conformally related .",
    "which conformal frame is the physical one is a very contentious issue @xcite .",
    "the most common argument against the jordan frame found in the literature is that the scalar field energy density can assume negative values .",
    "this happens because of the nonmininal coupling between the scalar field and geometry .",
    "the terms with the second covariant derivatives of the scalar field in the brans - dicke field equations contain the connection @xmath13 and therefore part of the dynamical description of gravity .",
    "but the energy density can be made nonnegative with the help of a new connection @xmath14 @xcite which is also associated with the physical metric @xmath15 .",
    "based on the considerations presented in the previous reference we work here considering jordan frame as the physical frame .",
    "one can expect that the presence of the scalar field leads to different predictions about the results obtained in general relativity .",
    "the standard cosmological scenario given by general relativity shows some spectacular successes but also have some puzzles , such as the flatness problem , the horizon problem and structure formation problems @xcite .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath6 can be limited by local physics experiments like cassini experiment @xcite : it should be huge today , the order of @xmath16 to satisfy the experimental tests of general relativity .",
    "this result reduced the interest in the brans - dicke theory because when @xmath17 in the motion equations we obtain the general relativity .",
    "the situation has changed with the proposal of the extended inflation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take advantage of the time dependence of gravitational constant @xmath18 to solve the bubble nucleation problem that arises in tradicional inflation . in the de sitter phase ,",
    "brans - dicke theory predicts power - law inflation instead of exponential ; in fact , following @xcite , at the beginning of inflation the brans - dicke solutions ( for @xmath19 ) approaches the einstein - de sitter solution . in the second stage of the inflation ,",
    "both the scalar field and the scale factor grow by power law rather than exponential .",
    "this feature prevents the so - called graceful exit problem .",
    "however , in order to work , the parameter must be @xmath20 , contradicting local observations .",
    "this drawback can be overcome through a generalization of the original brans - dicke theory , allowing the parameter @xmath6 to be a function of the field @xmath11 itself .    in 1999 ,",
    "the sn ia observations @xcite showed that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "a possible theoretical explanation for this acceleration is the vaccum energy with negative pressure , called dark energy ( that violates the strong energy condition ) .",
    "there are many dark energy models , for example quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , phantom @xcite and chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for the dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath21 whose equation of state is @xmath19 .",
    "but there are some problems with this alternative : why the cosmological constant is so small , nonzero , and comparable to the critical density at the present ?",
    "so , it is interesting to study dynamical dark energy models like the brans - dicke theory of gravity as a possible theory of k - essence coupled to gravity since it involves the simplest form of non - linear kinetic term for the brans - dicke scalar field @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this revival of the brans - dicke theory leads us to ask if the generation of gravity waves can be modified through the introduction of this scalar field . here , we propose to study the evolution of tensorial fluctuation in the traditional brans - dicke theory and its quantum origin and calculate the observables that can be compared with the observational data .",
    "the main interest in the presence of the scalar field is the possibility that it can change the evolution of gravity waves in comparison with the results obtained with general relativity @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we show the field equations , the equations of motion of the brans - dicke theory and the background solutions . in section iii",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum origin of the primordial cosmological gravitational waves in the brans - dicke theory . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the results for both theories are the same for the case of the particles number @xmath0 and for the case of the power spectrum @xmath1 and the energy density @xmath4 only when @xmath5 . for the spectral index @xmath2 we found that when the brans - dicke coupling parameter @xmath6 is bigger than unity the spectral index approximates the expression found in the general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> this may awake us to the possibility that @xmath6 varies with the cosmological scale .    </S>",
