    "one of our central objectives is to advocate their systematic use , and to propose their recognition as a valuable tool for geometric and algebraic combinatorics .",
    "our point of departure is an observation that different problems , including the question of existence of an embedding @xmath3 of riemann manifolds , the existence and classification of embeddings ( immersions ) of cubical surfaces into hypercubes or cubical lattices , the existence of a coloring of a graph @xmath4 with a prescribed number of colors etc .",
    ", can all be approached from a similar point of view .",
    "the unifying theme and a single point of view is provided by the concept of a groupoid . in each of the listed cases",
    "there is a groupoid naturally associated to an object of the given category . for each of these groupoids",
    "there is an associated  parallel transport  , holonomy groups and other related invariants which serve as obstructions for the existence of morphisms indicated in figure  [ fig : sphere7 ] .",

    "one of the manifestations of gauss `` theorema egregium '' is that the associated holonomy group is a metric invariant , consequently an isometry depicted in figure  [ fig : sphere7 ]  ( a ) is not possible .    in a similar fashion a cubical `` theorema egregium '' ( theorem  [ thm : cub - thm - egr ] )",

    "the cubulation ( quadrangulation ) of an annulus depicted in figure  [ fig : sphere7 ]  ( b ) does not admit a cubical embedding into a hypercube for the same formal reason ( incompatible holonomy ) a spherical cap can not be isometrically represented in the plane .",
    "perhaps it comes as a surprise that the graph coloring problem , figure  [ fig : sphere7 ]  ( c ) , can be also approached from a similar point of view .",
    "an analysis of holonomies ( `` parallel transport '' ) of diagrams of @xmath0-complexes of graphs ( simplicial complexes ) over the associated joswig groupoid eventually leads to a general result ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) which includes the `` odd '' case of babson - kozlov - lovsz coloring theorem as a special case .",
    "our objective is to lay a foundation for a program of associating groupoids to posets , graphs , complexes , arrangements , configurations and other combinatorial structures .",

    "parallel transport of graph and more general @xmath0-complexes over graphs / complexes is introduced and fundamental invariance of homotopy types of maps is established in propositions  [ prop : transport ] and [ prop : prenos ] .",

    "it is , or should be , well known that the concept of a _ group _ is sometimes not sufficient to deal with the concept of symmetry in general .",
    "groupoids , understood as groups with `` space - like properties '' , often alow us to handle objects which exhibit what is clearly recognized as symmetry although they admit no global automorphism whatsoever . unlike groups , groupoids are capable of describing reversible processes which can pass through a number of states . for example according to connes @xcite , heisenberg discovered quantum mechanics by considering the groupoid of quantum transitions rather than the group of symmetry .    by definition",
