    "recent _ hst _ observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have drastically changed our understanding of the structure of elliptical galaxies .",
    "first , no elliptical galaxies have cores with constant surface brightness .",
    "all of them turned out to have cusps with power - law surface brightness profiles .",
    "second , elliptical galaxies are divided into two groups in terms of the slope of the cusp : `` weak - cusp '' galaxies and `` strong - cusp '' galaxies .",
    "the weak - cusp galaxies have the surface brightness profiles expressed as @xmath3 with @xmath4 and deprojected luminosity density profiles expressed as @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the cusps of the strong - cusp galaxies are expressed by the same formula , but with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , it was found that bright galaxies have weak cusps , while faint galaxies have strong cusps .",
    "previously , bright elliptical galaxies were believed to have cores with constant surface brightness .",
    "high - resolution surface photometry showed that these cores are non - isothermal ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ hst _ observations revealed these cores are actually weak cusps .",
    "the origin of such weak cusps is not well understood .",
    "one possible way to form a density cusp is to introduce the central black hole .",
    "young ( 1980 ) studied the response of the structure of a stellar system to the adiabatic growth of the central black hole .",
    "he showed that the power - law density cusp with @xmath9 is formed around the black hole .",
    "the same result was obtained by quinlan , hernquist , & sigurdsson ( 1995 ) .    another way to form cusps using a central black hole",
    "was proposed by bahcall & wolf ( 1976 ) .",
    "they investigated the evolution of the structure of a stellar system around a black hole driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "they found a steady state solution with a steep cusp .",
    "shapiro & marchant ( 1978 ) and marchant & shapiro ( 1979 , 1980 ) performed monte carlo simulation and found that this steady state cusp is actually formed .",
    "both models predict cusps steeper than the observed ones .",
    "therefore the origin of these weak cusps can not be explained by means of these mechanisms .",
    "navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) found that the dark matter halos formed in standard cdm cosmogony is well approximated by a `` universal profile '' which approaches @xmath10 near the center .",
    "they argued that this result might explain the origin of weak cusps .",
    "recently , fukushige & makino ( 1997 ) performed the same calculation as navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but with much higher resolution in both mass and space .",
    "they obtained a nearly isothermal cusp .",
    "thus the cusps formed by cdm clustering scenario are also too steep .",
    "so far , the only scenario that successfully reproduced the weak cusps is the merging of two galaxies with central black holes ( @xcite , hereafter me ) .",
    "they investigated the mergings of two galaxies with central black holes by _",
    "n_-body simulations and found that the merger remnants have very shallow ( @xmath10 or shallower ) density cusps in the central regions .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the _ hst _ observations .",
    "the physical process by which the weak cusps are formed in a merger remnant was not clearly explained in me .",
    "it is obvious that the black holes played some important roles in the cusp formation , since no significant cusps were formed by the merger remnant of two galaxies without black holes .",
    "the merging of two galaxies with black holes involves several processes , such as the sinking of two black holes to the center of the remnant due to dynamical friction from field stars , the formation and hardening of a black hole binary and its back reaction to field stars .",
    "we need simpler models with which we can study the effect of each elementary process separately .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the sinking of a black hole due to dynamical friction and its back reaction to the distribution of field stars .",
    "we performed @xmath0-body simulation of the system of spherical galaxy model and a black hole placed at around the half mass radius of the galaxy .",
    "we found the shallow density cusp with @xmath11 is formed in the center of galaxies .",
    "thus we can conclude that the sinking of black hole is the dominant mechanism of the formation of weak cusps .    in the next section",
    ", we describe the numerical methods and initial models we used .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : result ] and a discussion and summary in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the initial conditions we used are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] .",

    "we used king models with the central potential parameter @xmath12 , 6 and 3 as initial galaxy models .",
    "the number of particles in the initial galaxies ( column 3 ) was 32767 or 131071 , and all particles have equal mass .",
    "we adopted the standard unit ( @xcite ) as the system of units , in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 is the total mass of the initial galaxy and @xmath17 is the total energy of the galaxy . in these units ,",
    "the half - mass radii of the initial galaxies are 0.98 , 0.80 and 0.84 for the king models with @xmath18 , 6 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the half - mass crossing time is @xmath19 for all models .",

    "we used different black hole masses ( 2 , 4 , 8 % of the mass of the whole system ) .",

    "[ fig:7 ] , we can see that the projected one - dimensional velocity dispersion also shows a marked increase at the center .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles are rather similar for off - center run and on - center run , since the central potential is dominated by the black hole in both runs . however ,",

    "the change in the anisotropy is monotonic , and inner region is more radial .",

    "note that this is quite different from the adiabatic response of orbit studied by young ( 1980 ) and quinlan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the case of the adiabatic response , orbits become more circular .    in run",
    "a , however , the behavior of the anisotropy is more complex . in the outermost region",
    ", orbits are predominantly radial because the stars kicked out by the black hole populate the outer halo .",
    "the effect of the black hole explains the general increase in @xmath66 in the outer region .",

    "there are at least two possible mechanisms for this decrease .",
    "first , the black hole should have ejected stars with radial orbit more efficiently than those with circular orbit .",
    "second , the increase in mass at the center of the galaxy is not instantaneous as in the case of run e. therefore , the response of orbits would be somewhere in between increase in @xmath66 for run e and decrease in @xmath66 for the adiabatic response .",
    "if the response is closer to adiabatic , it is natural that @xmath66 decreases .    in the spiral - in runs",
    "( runs b , c and d ) , @xmath66 shows the same tendency as that in the off - center run : @xmath66 increased in outer region and decreased in inner region .",
    "the stars in central region of the spiral - in run are somewhat more circular than those in the same region of run a. since the black hole deposited the angular momentum to the field stars , this result is quite natural .",

    "we can also see that the slope of the cusp is almost the same for all three runs .",
    "figure [ fig:11]a shows the relation between the black hole mass and the `` core radius '' .",
    "we adopted the definition of the core radius by mcmillan , hut , & makino ( 1990 ) : @xmath75 where @xmath51 is the distance of star _",
    "i _ from the central black hole and @xmath76 is the local density at the position of star _ i_. this definition gives a good estimate of the size of the `` weak cusp '' region ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig:11]b shows the relation between the black hole mass and the mass of stars within the core radius .",
    "figures [ fig:11]a and b indicate that the core size shows almost linear dependence on the black hole mass . of course , the relation is not strictly linear simply because the initial king model had a finite core . even for zero black hole mass",
    "the core size is still finite .",
    "+      figure [ fig:12 ] shows the time - averaged density profile for @xmath77 for run h and @xmath78 for run i. we used less concentrated king model ( @xmath79 ) as initial galaxy models for these runs .",

    "the result of run h ( figure [ fig:12]a ) shows that the structure of the core remains almost unchanged .",
    "the result of run i ( figure [ fig:12]b ) shows that the flat core is replaced by a slight increase in the central density ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , in this run , the initial potential energy of the black hole is not much larger than the bound energy of the stars in the core , since the core size is as large as the initial distance of the black hole from the center of the galaxy",
    ". therefore , this `` cuspy '' profile is likely to be formed through the process similar to that for run e , when we placed the black hole in the core .",

    "all other parameters are the same . in figure",
    "[ fig:13]a , it is clear that the central cusp becomes steeper as the system evolves , while in figure [ fig:13]b ( run j ) the change is negligible . this difference is due to the difference in the thermal relaxation time .",
    "the model in run a has much shorter relaxation time .",
    "real galaxies have the relaxation time several orders of magnitude larger than that of the model in run j. therefore , in real ellipticals the thermal evolution would be negligible and the profile would not change .     +",
    "we investigated the dynamical effect of a massive black hole which sinks into the galactic center to the structure of the galaxy by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we obtained three main results .",
    "first , we found that the black hole destroys the central core of the initial galaxy by heating up the field stars .",
    "after the black hole settled in the center , a weak density cusp ( @xmath81 ) remained around the central black hole .",
    "this result does not depend on how much angular momentum the sinking black hole initially has .",
    "this result nicely explains the recent _ hst _ observations of large elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , when a massive black hole is placed initially at the galactic center , the central density increases and a steep cusp ( @xmath55 ) is formed .",
    "second , the velocity anisotropy profiles are quite different between the above two cases . for the off - center black hole model , the orbits of the stars in the outer region tend to be radial , while in the inner region , the orbits tend to be circular .",
    "if the black hole spirals into the center , the field stars get angular momentum from the black hole and the orbits become more circular in the innermost region . for the on - center black hole model , however , the velocity is more radial near the center and approximately isotropic in the outer region .      from the present results , we can conclude that the weak density cusp can be formed if a massive black hole dynamically sinks to the center of a galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the prime cause of the formation of the weak cusp in simulations by me is the back reaction to the sinking black holes .",
    "moreover , the origin of the weak cusp in large elliptical galaxies found with recent _ hst _ observations can be explained by this galaxy merging and subsequent sinking of black holes . from this point of view , the dichotomy of elliptical galaxies ( `` core '' galaxies and `` power - law '' galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ) could be understood as follows : small and therefore `` cuspy '' ellipticals and normal spirals are most likely to be formed through dissipational collapse . during the formation process",
    ", they are likely to contain moderately massive central black holes ( @xmath82 ) . when these galaxes merge , black holes spiral into the center of the merger and left the weak cusp .",
    "if the merger still contain gas , significant fraction of that mass would accrete to the black hole ( @xcite ) . in this process , `` cuspy '' profile might be restored .",
    "however , if gas is already consumed by some process , the weak cusp is preserved .",
    "thus , massive ellipticals are likely to have weak cusps , while less massive ones are likely to have deep cusps , even if they are mergers .    in addition , we investigated the possibilities of identifying the mechanisms of the formation of the central cusps in elliptical galaxies by comparing our results with the observations .",
    "we calculated the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and the kurtosis for both models , but the difference in the profiles of them are quite small .",
    "there was a clear difference in the anisotropy . however , to determine anisotropy from observation is not easy",
    ". thus , it will be very difficult to detect the difference of the two types of the cusps in the spectroscopic data .",
    "the most clear difference is in the density profile .",
    "if the improved velocity dispersion data for the observed `` weak - cusp '' galaxies demonstrates the presence of massive black holes , our scenario would be the most plausible explanation .",
