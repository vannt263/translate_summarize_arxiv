    "among active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , bl lac objects are the most extreme class characterized by strong and rapid variability , high polarization , and weak emission lines .",
    "these extreme properties are generally interpreted as a consequence of nonthermal emission from a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight ( blandford & k@xmath1nigl 1979 ) . implicit in this hypothesis is that there exist many objects intrinsically identical to bl lac objects , with the relativistic jets oriented at large angle to the line of sight ( in the plane of the sky or perpendicular to our line of sight ) .",
    "while bl lac objects are dominated by relativistically beamed emission from the jets , these objects are most likely dominated by unbeamed , isotropic emission and appear to be very different .",
    "these objects constitute the so - called parent population of bl lac objects , and the unification in this way is usually called the  unified scheme \" ( antonucci & ulvestad 1985 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the parent population of bl lac objects is fanaroff - riley class i ( fri , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies ( browne 1983 ; wardle , moore & angel 1984 ) . there is growing evidence for bulk relativistic motion in the jets of blazars ( bl lac objects and ovv quasars ) , and the relativistic beaming model has been widely accepted ( ghisellini et al .",
    "however , almost all arguments for beaming can probably be explained in other ways as well ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the strongest challenge for this model remains in testing the unified scheme ( urry & padovani 1990 ) .",
    "numerous studies have found general agreement with the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies , including studies of 1 ) unbeamed properties of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies , such as extended radio emission , narrow emission lines , host galaxies and environments , 2 ) luminosity functions of the parent and beamed populations in different bands , 3 ) correlation between core - dominance parameter ( the ratio between core and extended radio flux ) and beamed properties ( for a review see antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . recently , hubble space telescope ( @xmath2 ) observations of host galaxies of bl lac objects ( falomo et al .",
    "1997 , urry et al . 1999 ) and of the optical cores of fri radio galaxies ( chiaberge et al . 1999 , 2000 ; capetti & celotti 1999 ) also supported this unified scheme .",
    "furthermore , superluminal motion confirmed in m87 by @xmath2 optical observation ( bireta et al .",
    "1999 ) and in b2 1144 + 35 by vlbi observation ( giovannini et al . 1999 ) provided strong evidence to this unified scheme .",
    "early multiwavelength observations showed that emission from bl lac objects is dominated by synchrotron component with the peak lying in the ir to x - ray energy range . in the 1990 s , with the observations by compton gamma - ray observatory and ground - based cherenkov telescopes",
    "it was found that bl lac objects emit enormous power in rapidly variable high energy gamma rays ( gev and tev ) , indicating a second peak in their overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ; ulrich , maraschi and urry 1997 ; fossati et al .",
    "a practical way to parameterize the different seds is to use the radio - to - x - ray effective spectral index @xmath0 . according to whether @xmath0 is greater than or less than 0.75 ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) bl",
    "lac objects are divided into two subclasses , the low - energy - peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) which have synchrotron peaks in ir / optical and high - energy - peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) which have synchrotron peaks in uv / soft x - ray .",
    "most radio - selected bl lac objects ( rbls ) are lbls , while most x - ray - selected bl lac objects ( xbls ) are hbls .",
    "further studies found that the sed difference between lbl and hbl can not be explained in terms of different viewing angles alone , suggesting that there must be some intrinsic differences that cause different seds between lbl and hbl ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ; georgranopoulos & marscher et al . 1998 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if fri radio galaxies are , as believed today , misaligned bl lac objects , it is expected that the jet - related nonthermal emission from fri radio galaxies also has a double - peak structure in the sed , and that there exist two intrinsically different subclasses of fri radio galaxies : one is lbl - like with @xmath3 , and the other is hbl - like with @xmath4 , corresponding to the parent populations for lbls and hbls , respectively .",
    "therefore , the double - peak characteristics of the sed of the jet - related emission and the existence or nonexistence of two subclasses of fri radio galaxies ( or more strictly speaking , the distribution of @xmath0 in fri radio galaxies ) can be used to test the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies .",
    "there are some difficulties at present to test the unified scheme in terms of the double - peak characteristics of the sed , because the detectors available are not yet sensitive enough to detect high - energy emission in most of fri radio galaxies . in this paper",
    "we collect x - ray and radio observations available in the literature for most of fris in the zirbel - baum sample ( zirbel & baum 1995 ) , and investigate the distribution of @xmath0 for the sample to test the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies .",

    "these results shows that there exist two subclasses of fri radio galaxies : one is hbl - like and the other is lbl - like .",
    "investigations of multifrequency spectral energy distribution from the radio through the x - ray bands for bl lac objects and fsrqs show that the different seds between hbl and lbl can not be explained in terms of different viewing angles alone ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there must be some intrinsic differences that cause different seds between lbl and hbl .",
    "as their parent population , fri radio galaxies should exhibit similar differences , but should not be what was once believed that every fri could appears as an hbl or an lbl if viewed at different angles to the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the existence of the hbl - like and lbl - like subclasses of fri radio galaxies supports the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies .",
    "in fact , as early as in 1992 , based on vla observation for complete samples of lbl and hbl , kollgaard et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that only those fri radio galaxies with intrinsically stronger cores would appear as an lbl if viewed at a small angle to the jet direction , while hbl may be found among the weaker cored fri radio galaxies .",
    "this conflicted with the prevailing point of view at that time that xbls ( mainly hbls ) were intrinsically the same as rbls ( mainly lbls ) , but now has actually become another evidence of the unified scheme , and is consistent with our results .",
    "in addition , the result of kollgaard et al . also suggests that care should be taken when using flux - limited complete samples to test the unified scheme , since there may be few hbl - like fris in the samples of brighter radio source .    in fig .",
    "1a , there is only one peak at @xmath31 in the distribution of @xmath0 . it had been known for long that the distribution of bl lac objects is bimodal which peaks at @xmath32 and 0.9 ( e.g. stocke et al .",
    "1985 , 1991 ; padovani & giommi 1995 , 1996 ; sambruna et al . 1996 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , a large fraction of newly discovered bl lac objects have been found to fill in the gap between the two peaks , which are called intermediate bl lac objects ( ibls , perlman et al . 1998 ; caccianiga et al .",
    "1999 ; laurent - muehleisen 1997 ; laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1999 ) . probably , as laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) pointed out , the bimodal distribution of bl lac objects found in earlier studies was caused by observational selection effects , and the true distribution of x - ray - to - radio flux ratio @xmath33 ( equals the distribution of @xmath0 ) is unimodal ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the distributions of @xmath0 for fri radio galaxies and bl lac objects in figs .",
    "1a and 1b are indistinguishable at the level of 90 percent . however , further quantitative test is necessary in the future , because it seems that none of the flux - limited complete samples of bl lac objects available at present can represent the whole class of bl lac objects .",
    "recently , chiaberge et al . ( 2000 ) tested the unification of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies by comparing the core emission of radio galaxies with those of bl lac objects , taking advantage of the @xmath2 optical observation for the core in 3cr fri radio galaxies . from the comparison of the optical and radio emission of fris and bl lac objects , they inferred lorentz factors of @xmath34 , which are typical for a relativistic jet ( padovani 1999 ; param et al .",
    "1996 ; marscher 1993 ) , supporting the unified scheme .",
    "their study also shows that in the @xmath35 ( optical and radio luminosities of the core ) plane , hbl and lbl move on different debeaming trails , and that debeaming trail of lbl crosses the 3cr fri region ( both the simple emission component model and two - velocity jet model ) . by taking the typical value for the lorentz factor or assuming a two - velocity structures for the jet",
    ", the location of debeamed bl lac objects in the 1jy sample in the @xmath35 plane coincides with that of fris in the 3cr sample , indicating that fris in the 3cr sample are lbl - like or ibl - like .",
    "this is also consistent with our result .",
    "it is notable that the percentage of lbl - like fris in our sample is less than 50% after beaming correction .",
    "this may indicate that some friis or at least the intermediate sources ( fri / ii ) should be included in the parent population of bl lac objects , which was also suggested by vla observations ( kollgaard et al .",
    "1992 ) and optical spectroscopic observations ( owen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "another possible explanation is that this may be caused by the limited angular resolution of x - ray observations .",
    "for example , the angular resolution of @xmath29 with the hri is only about 5@xmath36 .",
    "the x - ray flux of the central unresolved component of an fri radio galaxy is probably not contributed by the vla radio core alone . in the near future ,",
    "chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) will observe the central region of fri radio galaxies with much higher spatial resolution and sensitivity , obtaining a much better and larger x - ray - observed sample to test the unified scheme more reliably .",
    "in addition , with the cxo s high sensitive and high spectral resolution observation , the existence of hbl - like and lbl - like fri radio galaxies can be tested directly by comparing the x - ray spectra .",
    "since the hbl - like fris peak the synchrotron emission at uv / x - ray energy range , the x - rays are an extension of synchrotron emission with a steeper spectrum , and the shape of the optical - to - x - ray continuum is convex ( @xmath37 ) ; while for most lbl - like fris , the x - rays are dominated by inverse - compton emission with a flatter spectrum , and the shape of the optical - to - x - ray continuum is concave ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "therefore , hbl - like fris can be distinguished from lbl - like fris in the optical to soft x - ray energy range .    in summary ,",
    "the range of @xmath0 for fri radio galaxies is almost the same as that for bl lac objects , the distribution of @xmath0 probably peaks at the same position as bl lac objects , and the distribution of @xmath0 for fris is similar to that for bl lac objects .",
    "these suggest that there exist two subclasses of fri radio galaxies : one is hbl - like , and the other is lbl - like , corresponding to hbls and lbls , respectively .",
    "this result supports the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies .",

    "<S> in this paper , we collect radio and x - ray observations for most fanaroff - riley i ( fri ) radio galaxies in the zirbel - baum radio galaxy sample , and investigate the distribution of the radio - to - x - ray effective spectral index , @xmath0 , to test the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the range of @xmath0 for fri radio galaxies is almost the same as that for bl lac objects , that the distribution of @xmath0 probably peaks at the same position as bl lac objects , and that the distribution of @xmath0 for fris is similar to that for bl lac objects . </S>",
    "<S> these suggest that there exist two subclasses of fri radio galaxies : one is hbl - like , and the other is lbl - like , corresponding to high - energy - peaked ( hbl ) and low  energy - peaked ( lbl ) bl lac objects , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with previous vla observations , and supports the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies . </S>"
