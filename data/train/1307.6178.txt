    "the fact that the three known neutrino species @xmath1 have masses and mix among themselves , has now been conclusively established by many neutrino oscillation searches , that involved heroic experimental efforts during the past two decades .",
    "these three neutrinos , known as active neutrinos , participate in weak interactions with full strength and are part of the standard model ( sm ) , even though understanding their masses and mixings requires new physics beyond sm and is one of the most active areas of physics research right now . during the past several years , however , there have appeared indications from several experiments that there may be additional neutrinos , called sterile neutrinos ( denoted by @xmath2 ) which do not directly participate in the usual weak interactions .",
    "they , however , mix with active neutrinos to produce new effects in various experiments .",
    "these experiments are : the lsnd experiment  @xcite , the miniboone neutrino and anti - neutrino experiments  @xcite , two classes of experiments , one indicating a deficit in the reactor neutrino flux compared to theoretical calculations ( known as the reactor anomaly )  @xcite , and another with similar deficit in the gallium neutrino spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the new sterile neutrinos , which could explain some or all of these anomalies , must have masses @xmath0 ev in order to fit the observations  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how many such extra neutrino species are required by data .",
    "furthermore , the compatibility of short baseline ( sbl ) experiments  @xcite with the precision data from the planck satellite  @xcite , which indicates the presence of dark radiation , is still a matter of intense discussion , but there is the possibility that this dark radiation could also be a manifestation of sterile neutrinos . in view of all these indications for a light sterile neutrino ,",
    "there has been vigorous renewed interest in this field  @xcite with many proposed experiments to test these indications . on the theoretical side",
    ", there are many efforts to study the implications of light sterile neutrinos for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the current work is an effort in this direction and what we find interesting is that our work is a direct out growth of an effort to understand the nature of dark matter and is not a bsm scenario just to explain the sterile neutrinos .    an obvious challenge that theoretical attempts to understand sterile neutrinos must overcome",
    "is that since the sterile neutrino is a singlet under the sm gauge group , there is no reason for it to be as light as an ev as required to fit data ; in fact its natural mass scale could be anywhere below the planck mass .",
    "it is this aspect of the sterile neutrino physics that we explore in this paper , i.e. how to have a light sterile neutrino with mass in the ev range naturally while also simultaneously explaining the small masses of known active neutrinos .",
    "the model we discuss is a variation of a mirror model that was originally proposed to explain a light asymmetric dark matter ( adm )  @xcite and the relation @xmath3 ; as we will show in this paper , this model naturally leads to a light sterile neutrino with mass in the ev range , as required to fit current anomalies .",
    "a simple way to understand the small sterile neutrino mass is to adopt the same strategy as is generally adopted for the active neutrinos , i.e. to invoke an analog of the @xmath4 symmetry whose breaking at high scale is at the root of seesaw mechanism for small active neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "a realization of this proposal can be given by assuming that the sm has a mirror counter part with identical forces and matter , with interactions in the two sectors being related by mirror symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the mirror symmetry prevents the proliferation of coupling parameters that could be feared to accompany the doubling of particle number .",
    "these models are also well motivated as providing a candidate for dark matter since the lightest mirror baryon is stable for the same reason as the familiar proton , i.e. the analog of baryon number in the mirror sector , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the relevance of this model to the lightness of the sterile neutrino is that just like in the sm , the three neutrinos of the mirror sector are massless due to the mirror analog of @xmath4 symmetry ( denoted by @xmath6 henceforth )  @xcite .",
    "a mirror analog of the seesaw mechanism could provide a natural way for sterile neutrinos to be light , making them perfect candidates for being sterile neutrinos .",
    "it , however , turns out that when the requirement of getting a dark matter out of this theory as in  @xcite is imposed , what is required is a variant of the usual seesaw mechanism , where we use a common set of heavy majorana right - handed neutrinos connecting the visible and the mirror sector , instead of two sets as would be the case if we navely implement the seesaw mechanism in both sectors .",
    "since the right - handed neutrinos are sm singlet fields , their couplings to lepton doublets and higgs doublets of each sector are allowed by full gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "we describe the details of this model below but to summarize , the leading order result of adding a common set of right - handed neutrinos is that the neutrino mass matrix is a @xmath7 matrix ( where @xmath8 is the number of right - handed neutrinos ) , having the inverse seesaw form  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that when we impose the constraints of adm in this model a la  @xcite , it predicts too large a mass ( in the 100s of mev ) for mirror neutrinos if @xmath9 .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath10 , one of the three sterile neutrinos remains massless at tree level and picks up a small ev level mass due to planck scale effects .",
    "this plays the role of the ev sterile neutrino .",
    "we then show how one - loop effects generate the masses and mixings of the active neutrinos as well as the mixings between the active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "we find an interesting result that to get the active - sterile mixing ( asm ) , we need a two higgs doublet extension of the standard as well as mirror model .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present an outline of the adm model which provides a setting for the sterile neutrino discussion ; in sec .",
    "iii , we present the neutrino sector of the model and show how the 3 + 1 model arises .",
    "sec , iv is devoted to a detailed investigation of the neutrino masses and mixings in the active sector as well as the cross mixings between the sterile and active neutrinos .",
    "simple numerical examples are shown in sec .",
    "v before we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "in this section , we review the basic features of the mirror adm model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives an explanation of the similar magnitudes of dark matter content and baryon content of the universe .",
    "the basic postulate of the model is the existence of a mirror sector analogical to our universe with identical forces and matter content , i.e. the gauge groups of the mirror sector is @xmath11 and the matter and higgs assignments in the mirror sector are identical to those in the familiar sm sector . for simplicity",
    ", the mirror partners of the sm gauge bosons and fermions will be denoted by prime over the corresponding sm fields .",
    "thus each particle that we know has a mirror partner .",
    "the two sectors are always connected by gravity , which couples to all energy and matter universally .",
    "the model has a mirror symmetry ( @xmath12 symmetry ) which connects all the interactions and couplings of the two sectors .",
    "thus there are no new parameters in the model prior to symmetry breaking , even though the particle spectrum is doubled .",
    "symmetry breaking is chosen such that the mirror electroweak vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 . how this can be done starting with an exact mirror symmetric hamiltonian",
    "has been explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we follow the basic framework outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , for one of the crucial parameter of the model , the ratio @xmath14 , we choose a higher value , i.e. @xmath15 rather than @xmath16 chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite to ensure that the heavier mirror neutrinos decay before the bbn epoch ( see the discussion later ) . due to this asymmetry ,",
    "the mirror quarks become @xmath17 times heavier than the familiar sm quarks .",
    "however , depending on the nature of symmetry breaking in the mirror sector compared to the familiar sector ( e.g. if there are two higgs doublets with different mirror asymmetric vevs and hence a different value of tan@xmath18 in the mirror sector ) , the mirror quarks could be slightly lighter than @xmath19 .",
    "if we then assume that at some super heavy scale the gauge couplings unify ( or similar in magnitude ) , then , due to earlier decoupling of the mirror quarks from the mirror strong coupling evolution ( compared to the familiar qcd coupling evolution ) , we will have  @xcite @xmath20 , e.g. with @xmath21 gev .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this could lead easily to the lightest mirror baryon ( mirror neutron ) with @xmath22 which is different from the model in  @xcite ,",
    "we need a deep gluon potential to cancel out the large mirror quark masses , or other extra ingredients , to obtain a @xmath05 gev dark matter . more detailed discussion on this issue is given in appendix a. ] , thereby explaining the dark matter to baryonic mass density relation : @xmath3 .",
    "the next issue in such models is how to satisfy the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) constraints since there is a duplication of neutrino and photon number in the model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a symmetry breaking pattern is chosen such that all the mirror neutrinos are much heavier and decay before the bbn temperature .",
    "similarly , the mirror photon is chosen to have a mass of about 100 mev so that via its mixing with familiar photon , it also decays before the bbn epoch . here",
    "we will take a slightly different path as we explain below .",
    "roughly speaking , we will assume that bbn allows an effective neutrino number to be four so that we can take one light sterile neutrino with about 10% mixing with the active neutrinos , as suggested by experiments .",
    "the two other mirror particles that could create problems for bbn are : ( i ) the mirror photon and ( ii ) the mirror electron , whose mass is about 5 gev in our model . the mirror photon will be assumed massive as in ref .",
    "@xcite as just noted and will be allowed to decay via @xmath23 mixing ; as was shown in  @xcite , this will decay safely before the bbn epoch to @xmath24 .",
    "as far as the mirror electron is concerned , @xmath25 can annihilate to @xmath26 states and depleted enough to make a negligible contribution to the energy density of the universe at the bbn epoch .",
    "as shown in appendix b , for low gev range of electron mass , indeed this appears to be the case .",
    "alternatively , we may adopt the same strategy as in  @xcite and assume that we break the mirror electric charge by a non - zero vev to the charged member of the second mirror higgs doublet which couples to the heavier mirror leptons .",
    "this not only gives mass to the mirror photon just discussed but also lets @xmath27 with a lifetime much less than a second so as not to affect bbn .",
    "all the details of this discussion are given in  @xcite . in any case , these aspects of the model are not pertinent to the discussion of the paper but are mentioned only to point out that the overall model is quite compatible with cosmology .",
    "the neutrino sector of the model is the key focus of this paper .",
    "we therefore identify explicitly some of the key points and quantities relevant to this discussion . unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce only two heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath28 to connect the ordinary and mirror sectors , or specifically the three flavors of active neutrinos @xmath29 as well as mirror neutrinos @xmath30 are connected in a mass matrix via the two right - handed `` bridge '' neutrinos . to proceed with further analysis",
    ", we first note that we can parameterize the right - handed mass matrix as a diagonal one , by a suitable choice of basis , i.e. @xmath31 the yukawa coupling involving the two right - handed neutrinos connecting the two sectors can be written as : @xmath32 generally @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and then the resultant dirac mass matrix and its mirror counterpart read , respectively , @xmath35    as there are only two right - handed neutrinos in the model , by a appropriate unitary transformation , we can always decouple the two massless states ( at tree level ) @xmath36 from the other massive ones , leaving the simplified @xmath37 ( mirror ) dirac matrix connecting the two left - handed neutrinos @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and the heavy right - handed ones , written in the form of , respectively , @xmath40 consequently , the @xmath41 neutrino mass matrix is , in the basis of @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 in this case , there exist two more massless states at tree level , which are in the form of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) where @xmath46 and @xmath47 have identical flavor structure prior to seesaw diagonalization .",
    "it follows from this expression that @xmath48 are predominantly active neutrino states . summarizing then",
    ", we have a total of three active neutrino states and one sterile state which are massless at tree level .",
    "this is the beginning of the construction of the @xmath49 model .",
    "next we discuss how these various states pick up masses .",
    "two of the three active massless states obtain their masses radiatively  @xcite , details of which are described in the subsequent section .",
    "the magnitude of those masses are , to the zeroth order in @xmath50 , @xmath51 via the scalar and @xmath52 boson loops .",
    "of the three sterile neutrinos , the two massive ones pick up mass via tree level seesaw as follows : @xmath53 since the model of ref .",

    "these sterile states have short enough lifetime to decay before the bbn epoch .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the mass of the lightest sterile neutrino .",
