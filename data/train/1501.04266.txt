    "heavy - light quark - antiquark system @xmath12 plays an important role in studying the strong interactions between quark and antiquarks .",
    "great progress was made in the measurement of the spectrum of heavy - light quark - antiquark system in the last decade . in the charm sector",
    ", several new excited meson states were discovered in the previous several years @xcite . for @xmath13 mesons ,",
    "the resonances of @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite were observed , while for @xmath18 mesons , the resonances @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite were established .",
    "the spectroscopy provides a powerful test of the theoretical predictions based on the quark model in the standard model .",
    "the bound state of the heavy - light quark - antiquark system can be studied with the relativistic wave equation , where an effective potential compatible with qcd is taken @xcite .",
    "the potential shows a linear confining behavior at long distance and a coulombic behavior at short distance .",
    "the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons have been investigated in the relativistic potential model in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our recent work @xcite , the spectra for lower orbital and radial excitations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons were calculated , a good agreement with experiment @xcite was obtained . here",
    "we extend our previous work to include the higher excited states and compare the prediction with the spectrum measured in experiment in recent years .",

    "@xcite , the method used in this work is different and the recently observed states are also carefully studied in this work .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give the effective hamiltonian for the heavy - light quark - antiquark system and solve the relativistic wave equation theoretically .",
    "section iii is for the numerical result and discussion . in section",
    "iv we have a brief summary .",
    "in the potential model one assumes that hadrons can be treated in terms of valence - quark configurations . here",
    "we employ the relativistic potential model to describe the heavy - light @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the effective potential between the quark and antiquark in the meson is one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) dominant at short distances and with a linear confinement at long distances .",
    "since there is a light quark in the heavy - light system , it requires to include relativistic dynamics in the hamiltonian . the relativistic version of schrdinger wave equation describing the heavy - light system is written as @xmath25 in the rest frame of the bound state system , the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation will be the masses of mesons .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the mass and momentum of the heavy quark , respectively , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 the mass and momentum of the light antiquark .",
    "@xmath32 is the funnel potential , which includes only the spin - independent part of the strong interaction between the heavy and light quarks @xmath33 the potential is taken as a combination of a coulomb term and a linear confining term , whose behavior is compatible with qcd at both short- and long - distance @xcite .",
    "the first term is obtained from the calculation of one - gluon - exchange diagram in perturbative qcd .",
    "it dominates at short - distance .",
    "the second term is the linear confining term .",
    "the third term is a phenomenological constant , which can be adjusted to give the correct ground state energy - level of the quark - antiquark system .    the running coupling constant @xmath34 in eq.([e4 ] )",
    "is obtained from the coupling constant in momentum space @xmath35 after the fourier transformation .",
    "it can be written in a more convenient form @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are free parameters which can be fitted to make the behavior of the running coupling constant at short distance be consistent with the coupling constant in momentum space predicted by qcd . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath45 in eq.([e2 ] ) is the spin - dependent part of the hamiltonian @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spin - spin hyperfine - interaction term , which is @xmath48 with @xmath49 where the parameter @xmath50 is taken as quark mass - dependent @xcite @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are phenomenological parameters .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction term @xmath54 consists of the color - magnetic term and the thomas - precession term @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the relative orbital angular momentum between the quark and antiquark .",
    "the spin - dependent hamiltonian @xmath45 is the result of oge diagram in the non - relativistic approximation @xcite .",

    "are dropped .",
    "however , it is not reasonable to drop them completely for the heavy - light system as the light quark should be highly relativistic .",
    "there may also be bound - state effect in the spin - dependent interaction terms which can not be described by the oge potential .",
    "we assume that these effects can be included by replacing the light quark masses with a set of new parameters , which can be determined by fitting the spectra of heavy mesons",

    "we extend our previous work by studying more excited states with higher orbital quantum numbers . in the heavy quark limit the spin of the heavy quark decouples from the interaction @xcite ,",

    "the @xmath75 term of the hyperfine interaction @xmath47 conserves all the four quantum numbers , it gives the splitting of states with different total spin .",
    "the tensor part of @xmath47 does not conserve the orbital angular momentum , it causes mixing between the states with different orbital angular momenta @xmath76 , while the spin - orbit interaction @xmath54 does not conserve the total spin , it causes mixing between the states with different total spin quantum numbers @xmath77 .",
