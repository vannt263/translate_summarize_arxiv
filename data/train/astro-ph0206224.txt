    "the results of observational cosmology in the last years have opened up an unprecedented opportunity to test the veracity of a number of cosmological scenarios as well as to establish a more solid connection between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the most remarkable finding among these results comes from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) that suggest that the expansion of the universe is speeding up , not slowing down @xcite .",
    "as widely known such a result poses a crucial problem for all cdm models since their generic prediction is a decelerating universe ( @xmath5 ) , whatever the sign adopted for the curvature parameter . indirectly ,",
    "similar results have also been obtained , independent of the sne ia analyses , by combining the latest galaxy clustering data with cmb measurements @xcite .    to reconcile these observational results with theory ,",
    "cosmologists have proposed more general models containing a negative - pressure dark component that would be responsible for the present accelerated stage of the universe .",
    "although a large number of pieces of observational evidence have consistently suggested a universe composed of @xmath6 of dark energy , the exact nature of this new component is not well understood at present . among the several candidates for dark energy discussed in the recent literature ,",
    "the simplest and most theoretically appealing possibility is the vacuum energy or cosmological constant . despite the serious problem that arises when one considers a nonzero vacuum energy @xcite ,",
    "models with a relic cosmological constant ( @xmath7cdm ) seem to be our best description of the observed universe , being considered as a serious candidate for standard cosmology .    on the other hand , motivated by particle physics considerations ,",
    "there has been growing interest in cosmological models based on the framework of brane - induced gravity @xcite .",
    "the general principle behind such models is that our 4-dimensional universe would be a surface or a brane embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time on which gravity can propagate . in some of these scenarios , there is a certain crossover scale @xmath8 that defines what kind of gravity an observer on the brane will observe . for distances shorter than @xmath8 , such an observer will measure the usual 4-dimensional gravitational @xmath9 force whereas for distances larger than @xmath8 the gravitational force follows the 5-dimensional @xmath10 behavior . in this way",
    ", gravity gets weaker at cosmic distances and , therefore , it is natural to think that such an effect has some implications on the dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "several aspects of brane world cosmologies have been explored in the recent literature .",
    "for example , the issue related to the cosmological constant problem has been addressed @xcite as well as evolution of cosmological perturbations in the gauge - invariant formalism @xcite , cosmological phase transitions @xcite , inflationary solutions @xcite , baryogenesis @xcite , stochastic background of gravitational waves @xcite , singularity , homogeneity , flatness and entropy problems @xcite , among others ( see @xcite for a discussion on the different perspectives of brane world models ) . from the observational viewpoint ,",
    "however , the present situation is somewhat controversial . while the authors of refs . @xcite",
    "have shown that such models are in agreement with the most recent cosmological observations ( for example , they found that a flat universe with @xmath11 and @xmath12 is consistent with the currently sne ia + cmb data ) , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have claimed that a larger sample of sne ia data can also be used to rule out these models at least at the 2@xmath13 level .",
    "recently , one of us @xcite used measurements of the angular size of high-@xmath14 compact radio sources to show that the best fit model for these data is a slightly closed universe with @xmath15 and a crossover radius of the order of 0.94@xmath16 .    for the reasons presented earlier , the comparison between any alternative cosmology and @xmath7cdm models is very important . in this concern",
    ", statistical properties of gravitational lenses may be an interesting tool because , as is well known , they provide restrictive limits on the vaccum energy contribution ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , in brane world models the distance to an object at a given redshift @xmath14 is smaller than the distance to the same object in @xmath7cdm models ( assuming the same value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the constraints coming from lensing statistics will be weaker for these models than for their @xmath7cdm counterparts .    in this paper , we explore the implications of gravitationally lensed qsos for models based on the framework of the brane - induced gravity of dvali _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that have been recently proposed in refs .",
    "we restrict our analysis to accelerated models , or equivalently , models that have a  self - inflationary \" solution with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the hubble parameter ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , in such scenarios , the bulk gravity sees its own curvature term on the brane as a negative - pressure dark component and accelerates the universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the basic field equations and distance formulas relevant for our analysis .",
    "we then proceed to analyze the constraints from lensing statistics on these models in section 3 . in section 4 our main conclusions",
    "are presented .",

    "such a quantity can be easily obtained in the following way : consider that photons are emitted by a source with coordinate @xmath30 at time @xmath31 and are received at time @xmath32 by an observer located at coordinate @xmath33 .",

    "the angular diameter distance to a light source at @xmath50 and @xmath51 and observed at @xmath52 and @xmath53 is defined as the ratio of the source diameter to its angular diameter , i.e. , @xmath54 in the general case , the angular diameter distance , @xmath55 , between two objects , for example , a lens at @xmath56 and a source ( galaxy ) at @xmath57 , reads @xmath58 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this paper we work with a sample of 867 ( @xmath59 ) high luminosity optical quasars which include 5 lensed quasars .",
    "these data are taken from optical lens surveys such as the hst snapshot survey @xcite , the crampton survey @xcite , the yee survey @xcite , surdej survey @xcite , the not survey @xcite and the fks survey @xcite . since the lens surveys and quasar catalogs usually use v magnitudes , we transform @xmath60 to b - band magnitude by using @xmath61 as suggested by bahcall _",

    "the total optical depth is obtained by integrating @xmath62 along the line of sight from @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) to @xmath57 .",

    "note that , at higher redshifts ( @xmath85 ) , an increase in @xmath86 at fixed @xmath2 tends to reduce the optical depth for lensing .",

    "this decrease of the optical depth as the value of @xmath86 is increased ( at a fixed @xmath57 and @xmath2 ) occurs because , at high redshift , say @xmath85 , the distance between two redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath81 and @xmath57 ) is smaller for higher values of @xmath86 .    0.1 in    in order to obtain the correct lensing probability we have made two corrections to the optical depth , namely",
