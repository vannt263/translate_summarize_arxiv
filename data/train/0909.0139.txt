    "strongly correlated systems present one of the major theoretical challenges in last decades and are stimulating the intensive search for adequate numerical methods to evaluate their properties . within the low - dimensional systems ,",
    "in particular one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems the breakthrough has been achieved with the introduction of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite allowing accurate calculation of the ground - state wavefunction and its static properties on large systems far beyond those available with the exact - diagonalization methods . among various dmrg extensions",
    "@xcite we concentrate here on the goal to study the dynamical response of such systems at finite temperatures @xmath0 .",
    "it should be observed that in spite of the satisfactory description and an understanding of static properties of generic 1d systems at @xmath0 the corresponding dynamics , in particular the low - frequency one as manifested in the transport quantities , nmr relaxation , is far less understood and approachable via numerical methods .    for dynamical response within the ground - state",
    "the targeting within the dmrg has been extended to contain also excited states.@xcite transfer - matrix dmrg @xcite is very efficient to evaluate thermodynamic properties of models with short - range interactions , as well as some dynamical correlations of very limited range .",
    "time dependent dmrg @xcite developed recently enables studies of short - time evolution of general many - body systems , hence also of @xmath0 behavior , but is rather limited in reaching the low-@xmath1 response .",
    "recently , a dmrg method extended with the polynomial expansion has been proposed to treat low-@xmath2",
    "dynamics.@xcite on the other hand , methods emerging from the exact diagonalization approach as the @xmath0 lanczos method ( ftlm ) @xcite and the low-@xmath2 version @xcite have high-@xmath1 resolution and provide the information on the nontrivial dynamics of correlated models , but are still restricted to small systems reachable with exact diagonalization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( [ sec : method ] )",
    "we first present our new method , with which we calculate some static and dynamical properties of the model described in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we also show our results , first the test of our method on the @xmath3 model and then our main results for the isotropic heisenberg model . in the last section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we propose a new method for the calculation of the @xmath0 dynamics which is a combination of the ftlm and the dmrg , namely the finite - temperature dynamical dmrg ( ftd - dmrg ) method .",
    "it is constructed to calculate dynamical response functions in 1d systems at @xmath0 , with the emphasis on the low-@xmath1 regime . as a test",
    "we consider highly nontrivial spin correlations within the anisotropic heisenberg model on a chain .",
    "in the standard @xmath4 dmrg the ground - state is used to construct the basis . in our case we use the full @xmath0 density matrix , which can in general be expressed with eigenstates @xmath5 and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the ( grand)canonical sum .",
    "we proceed by extending the density matrix , eq.([rho ] ) , with the sampling over the random vectors @xmath10 where @xmath11 denote random amplitudes , @xmath12 it is easy to show that eq.([rho2 ] ) reduces to eq.([rho ] ) expressed in diagonal basis @xmath13 since offdiagonal terms vanish assuming normalized and random @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite    in eq .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) we evaluate the operator @xmath15 on @xmath14 by starting the lanczos procedure from @xmath14 .",
    "after diagonalization of the lanczos tridiagonal @xmath16 , we obtain the first series of lanczos eigenvectors @xmath17 with corresponding eigenenergies @xmath18 , @xmath19 it is evident that for @xmath20 approaching @xmath21 eq .  ( [ rho3 ] ) reproduces fully eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , while for @xmath22 as used in practice represents an efficient way of evaluation of density matrix .",
    "the sum @xmath9 may be evaluated in the same manner as within the ftlm @xcite @xmath23 in the original @xmath4 dmrg procedure one targets the ground - state .",
    "@xcite instead , at @xmath0 we target states @xmath24 and construct the density matrix according to eq .",
    "( [ rho3 ] ) .    since our aim is to calculate dynamical response functions , expressed as autocorrelation functions , we also require a good representation of the operator density matrix , @xmath25 it replaces the operator on the ground - state in original @xmath4 dmrg @xcite and is evaluated by extending eq .",
    "( [ rho3 ] ) , @xmath26 in the proposed targeting we sum up above contributions with weighting factors , @xmath27 with the restriction @xmath28 . from @xmath29 we prepare the reduced density matrix by integrating out the environment , which is then used to construct the basis within the infinite and finite algorithms of the dmrg . @xcite our way of targeting is in fact very similar to the one in ref . , with an additional random sampling suppressing the non - diagonal terms of @xmath30 . in such a way we prepare the basis for any @xmath0 , whereby limitations are emerging from the truncation of the basis being more under control for low @xmath2 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that for dynamical response at particular @xmath1 there is an improvement to target also excited states corresponding to so called correction vectors .",
    "@xcite still , the latter does not affect quality of the most interesting and challenging regime @xmath31 as well as it increases the computational demand , hence we do not employ it here .",
    "physical quantities are calculated in the measurement part of the ftd - dmrg procedure in the same manner as within the ftlm .",
    "@xcite a dynamical autocorrelation function @xmath32 is evaluated with the use of two lanczos series of eigenstates and eigenenergies , @xmath33 and eigenenergies @xmath34 is obtained from second lanczos procedure starting from the initial vector @xmath35 .",

    "more accurate results are obtained with open boundary conditions , @xcite hence one defines @xmath47 whereby @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in our calculations we concentrate on most challenging @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "the relaxation function @xmath52 should be an even function of @xmath1 .",
    "this represents another nontrivial test for the ftd - dmrg method .",
    "in addition to considering complete spectra @xmath53 better defined criteria are frequency moments , @xmath54 due to symmetry only even @xmath55 are finite while the static susceptibility corresponds to @xmath56 .    in the following",
    "we employ the ftd - dmrg method to evaluate @xmath57 for @xmath58 and various @xmath2 . in the actual implementation we use the infinite and finite - size dmrg basis preparation and the calculation of @xmath59 via eq.([aomlm ] ) ( @xmath60 ) performed on the system divided into two subblocks of size @xmath61 and two coupling sites in between .",
    "@xcite in the preparatory sweeping typically 1 or 2 sweeps are sufficient for the convergence of the basis .",
    "important parameters for the final quality of results are the ( subblock ) dmrg truncation number @xmath62 and the number of lanczos steps @xmath20 .",
    "we are typically restricted to @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have two kinds of sampling .",
    "one in the determination of the density matrix eq .",
    "( [ rho2 ] ) , @xmath65 for the basis preparation , and the other in the evaluation of the final eq .",
    "( [ aomlm ] ) , @xmath66 . while only modest @xmath67 is adequate , @xmath68 is needed in particular at low @xmath2 @xcite to get accurate matrix elements . at higher @xmath2 @xmath69",
    "can be reduced effectively to @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite furtheron we mainly consider @xmath71 with @xmath72 . when evaluating the feasibility of various methods we should keep in mind that the full exact diagonalization evaluation of @xmath44 at @xmath0 for the model at hand can be performed up to @xmath73 , with the ftlm technique up to @xmath74 , while in the following we present the ftd - dmrg results up to @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 case maps onto noninteracting spinless fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation and @xmath59 can be expressed for any @xmath0 in a lindhard form . for finite @xmath39",
    "the only caveat is that the ftd - dmrg is performed within a canonical systems with fixed @xmath77 , i.e. , with fixed number of fermions @xmath78 while the usual ( easier ) evaluation is within the grandcanonical ensemble . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the ftd - dmrg result for ( unsymmetrized ) relaxation function @xmath57 at low @xmath79 .",
    "results are for @xmath80 where the basis is heavily reduced , i.e. , only @xmath81 of all states are retained within the final evaluation . for comparison",
    "we show the exact ( grandcanonical ) fermionic result for the same system with open boundary condition and for all presented spectra we use the damping @xmath82 .",
    "oscillations are a clear sign of finite - size system and slowly disappear with increasing @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "the finite - size effect can be avoided by smoothing with a gaussian filter with the width adapted to the frequency @xmath83 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it is evident that at low @xmath84 the agreement between the ftd - dmrg and the exact result is very satisfactory . at high",

    "the isotropic @xmath94 case ( at @xmath77 ) representing marginally gapless system is by far more challenging . for @xmath0",
    "there are no exact results for dynamical quantities .",
    "the bosonization approach provides a form for @xmath44 within the low @xmath95 regime . @xcite",
    "relative to the @xmath76 case the divergence for @xmath94 is stronger and nontrivial .",

    "an obvious deficiency is in results for dynamic quantities at @xmath31 since the qmc approach ( due to the maximum entropy procedure ) seems to have considerable uncertainty in this regime .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the latter regime is frequently just the most interesting , e.g. , in connection with the nmr relaxation rate @xmath99 , with transport quantities etc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present results for @xmath57 obtained for @xmath75 sites and different @xmath2 . since spectra are peaked at @xmath100 ( in contrast to fig .",

    "deviations from the linear scaling mostly emerge from the random sampling in the basis preparation and the dynamical quantity evaluation , and for the latter are indicated with error bars .",

    "[ fig5 ] , together with the result of the qmc analysis @xcite of the analytical expression @xmath108^{1/2}.\\ ] ] our ftd - dmrg result is quite consistent with qmc results at higher @xmath109 .",

    "@xcite on the other hand , it should be reminded that for this quantity there are no reliable larger - system alternative results since the qmc analysis @xcite appears to have some difficulties in the regime @xmath31 .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the ftd - dmrg method , which is the extension of the density matrix - based optimization of target states and the ftlm method for the evaluation of dynamical quantities at @xmath0 .",
    "it is so far well founded and tested for relatively low t and not too large systems , e.g. , @xmath116 , while the feasibility or possible breakdown at larger @xmath2 should still be understood . presented results are obtained for systems with @xmath117 ( normalized so that @xmath118 ) although the method is not in principle limited to low @xmath2 since it is not essential that all relevant many - body states are well represented , in analogy to the ftlm .",
    "@xcite the emphasis so far is on the most challenging @xmath31 dynamical response while higher @xmath1 could be improved by extending the density matrix by optimizing the correction vector at particular @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite as the test we use the @xmath76 case which is nontrivial for the ftd - dmrg method while exact results are available via the spinless - fermion representation .",
    "on the other hand , results for the isotropic @xmath94 case where we concentrate on the low @xmath95 regime of dynamical spin correlations @xmath59 show that the presented method goes beyond the capabilities of up - to - date numerical methods , e.g. , in the case of @xmath111 .",
