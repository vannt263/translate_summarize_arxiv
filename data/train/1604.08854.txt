    "distributed vibration sensors based on the @xmath0-otdr technique are highly promising for remote control of long - distance objects such as bridges and pipelines @xcite . in contrast to conventional otdr sensing devices , probing the optic fiber with a narrowband light source allows locating perturbations by their effect on the backscattering signals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , which are detected by taking into account their phases  @xcite .",
    "last decades @xmath0-otdr based sensing systems attracted a significant deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in manufacturing of fiber - optic components result in significant decrease of the production cost of such sensing devices .    however , phase - sensitive registration of backscattering light waves is possible only if the coherence length of the light source is not less than the pulse duration @xcite .",
    "this requirement makes light sources one of the most expensive part of sensors . in general , quality of sensing systems for remote monitoring of extended objects",
    "is determined by its ability to detect perturbations caused by an activity near the sensor fiber within a background , where this background is formed both by external noises ( _ e.g. _ , seismic noises ) and self - noises of the system . in order to maximize the rate of recognized ( _ i.e. _ , detected and classified ) perturbations , @xmath0-otdr based sensors have been studied throughout via numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite have shined a new light on the role of the laser source in @xmath0-otdr based sensors .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that a frequency drift of sources can suppress the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and even may cause failures .",
    "numerical simulations based on calculating the frc for different light sources take into account only the frequency drift on large - time scales ( with respect to the characteristic operation time of @xmath0-otdr systems , which is in order of miliseconds ) .",
    "this allows comparing a number of light sources and reveal the best one from this number .",
    "thus , this method can be improved by development of quantitative criteria for laser sources for @xmath0-otdr based sensors .",
    "one may also suppose that short - time scales are also important for operating of the @xmath0-otdr based sensing systems since sufficiently fast frequency drifts can be a reason for failures .",
    "-4 mm    in the present work , we study the effect of frequency drifts of laser sources for @xmath0-otdr based sensing systems using experimental tests , numerical simulation , and experimental verification of the suggested model .",
    "first of all , we demonstrate experimentally the importance of frequency drift both on short - time and large - time scales by measuring the rate of correctly recognized in the background events for three light sources with different characteristics . on the basis of insights from experiment , we perform numerical simulation based on the mathematical model , which take into account two characteristic time scales of the frequency drift of laser sources .",
    "thus , requirements for the frequency drift ( additional to the once given by the frc from ref .",
    "@xcite ) for sources in @xmath0-otdr based sensors , which aimed on maximization of the rate of correctly recognized events , are formulated .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by substituting ( [ eq : l ] ) to ( [ eq : phase ] ) , we obtain periodical phase oscillations in the following form @xmath1.\\ ] ] this expression being substituted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : singal2 ] ) allows one to obtain the signal detected by the system in the case of absence of the background .",
    "it should be noted that developed model assumes that the aom creates perfect ( in terms of zero - one amplitude ) laser pulses .",
    "however , the aom has the finite extinction ratio @xmath2 being about 55 db .",
    "thus , this imperfection can be of interest for our system .",
    "nevertheless , negative effects from this imperfection are not valid for the case , where the extinction ratio is much greater that the ratio between the length of the fiber and length of the pulse @xmath3 this is the case for our setup since @xmath2 is about 55 db and @xmath4 is close to 2500 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to 34 db .    second , we should take into account an additional impact position variations of the scattering centers due to thermal fluctuations , which can generally to be described as a white noise in the following form @xmath5 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 describes the position variation of the scattering centers .",
    "due to the frequency drift @xmath7 , one has : @xmath8 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] here we distinguish two time scales : @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for large - time frequency drift ( scales of minutes ) and @xmath11 stands for short - time frequency drift ( scales of milliseconds ) .",
    "in the detection part , there are additional sources of noise .",
    "they can be accounted as a white noise @xmath12 as follows @xmath13    considering all of these imperfections , we finally obtain the following relation @xmath14\\times\\\\      & \\left[{l_i}{+}l_n(t){+}\\delta{l}_i(t)\\right]\\!\\bigg)\\!\\bigg|^2\\otimes\\delta_{\\rm det}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : singalfinal ] ) is the quintessence of the suggested mathematical model for @xmath0-otdr sensing systems .",
    "this expression describes the signal @xmath15 registered by the @xmath0-otdr sensor in the time moment @xmath16 .",
    "this signal consists of the noise component @xmath12 , which can be treated using the method described ref .",

    "summation takes place over scattering centers .",
    "we point out that the important ingredient of this model is taking into account two time scales @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the final expression should be also converged with the detector impulse response .    to obtain the signal without external perturbations , one can just set input data for the light source and put them into eq .",

    "( [ eq : l ] ) .    in order to verify the suggested model and its predictions , we compare the numerical results with experiments for our three laser sources .",
    "the results of simulations ( see fig .  [",

    "now we also can formulate quintile criteria for the light source . towards this end , we study the dependence between the number of properly revealed non - conventional events . on the basis of this study , we can conclude that the light source can have smooth drift of the center wavelength source up to 100 mhz / min , and short - term stability should below the level 1 mhz .",
