    "disordered systems , both classical and quantum , lie at the center - stage of condensed matter physics @xcite . challenging open questions in disordered systems include those in the realms of spin glasses @xcite , neural networks @xcite , percolation @xcite , and high @xmath0 superconductivity @xcite . phenomena like anderson localization @xcite , and absence of magnetization in several classical spin models @xcite are effects of disorder .",
    "in particular , classical ferromagnetic spin models with discrete , or continuous , symmetries are very sensitive to random magnetic fields , distributed in accordance with the symmetry , in low dimensions @xcite . for instance , an arbitrary small random magnetic field with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) symmetry destroys spontaneous magnetization in the ising model in 2d at any temperature @xmath3 , including @xmath4 . similar effect holds for the xy model in 2d at @xmath4 in a random field with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 symmetry , or heisenberg model in 2d at @xmath4 in @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) symmetry in random field . in these cases ,",
    "the effects of disorder amplify the effects of continuous symmetry , that destroys spontaneous magnetization at any @xmath9 .",
    "the effect is even more dramatic in 3d , where the random field destroys spontaneous magnetization at any @xmath10 .",
    "( for a general description of these , see @xcite . )",
    "the appropriate symmetry of the random field is essential for the above mentioned results .",
    "the natural question arises as to what happens if the distribution of the random field does not exhibit the symmetry , in particular the continuous symmetry .",
    "yet another natural question is how does the spin systems in random fields behave in the quantum limit .",
    "the latter question is particularly interesting in view of the fact that nowadays it is possible to realize practically ideal models of quantum spin systems ( with spin s=1/2 , 1 , 3/2 , ... , and with ising , xy , or heisenberg interactions ) in controlled random fields @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to understand the physics of both classical and quantum spin models in random fields that break their symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the classical xy spin model in a random field that breaks the continuous u(1 ) ( @xmath11 ) symmetry .",
    "we investigate this model in the mean field approximation @xcite . despite its simplicity , this model with the two - dimensional spin variable , magnetizes in the absence of disorder below a certain critical temperature , which can be calculated exactly . as a result of continuous symmetry , the possible values of spontaneous magnetization form a circle in the plane .",
    "a random magnetic field pointing along the @xmath12-direction is introduced , by adding a new term to the energy of the model .",
    "this term breaks the continuous symmetry of the model , but the critical temperature persists .",
    "the present paper studies the critical behaviour and properties of spontaneous magnetization in the resulting mean - field disordered system . we prove that , as may be expected , adding a random field lowers the critical temperature .",
    "next , we show that the magnetization of the disordered system is lower than that of the pure one  another intuitively plausible result , first shown numerically and then by perturbation expansions : one around the critical temperature of the pure model and another for low temperatures .",
    "next , we introduce a _ constant _ magnetic field , which breaks the continuous symmetry of the model even in the absence of disorder .",
    "in fact , the system now magnetizes at all temperatures in the direction parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "when we now also add a random field as described above , the length of the magnetization vector decreases again .",
    "moreover , the magnetization gets atrracted towards the @xmath13- axis , i.e. the direction transverse to that of the random field .",
    "however , the @xmath13-component of the magnetization * can * increase for certain choices of the constant field .",
    "we view this effect as a case of `` random field induced order '' , by analogy with the effect studied in @xcite , where numerical evidence was given for appearance of magnetization in the xy model on a two - dimensional lattice with the introduction of disorder .",
    "in contrast to the present work , in this other case no mean - field approximation was used and no uniform magnetic field was introduced .",
    "the effect of `` random field induced order '' has , of course , a long history @xcite .",
    "recently it has become vividly discussed in the context of @xmath14 ordering in a graphene quantum hall ferromagnet @xcite , and ordering in @xmath15he - a arerogel and amorphous ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "let us stress that the novel aspects of our previous paper @xcite consists in clarifying certain aspect of the rigorous proof of the appearance of magnetization in xy model at @xmath16 , presentation of a novel evidence for the same effect at @xmath17 , and a proposal for realisation of quantum version of the effect with ultracold atoms . in the subsequent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have shown how the `` random field induced order '' exhibits itself in a system of two - component trapped bose - einstein condensate with random raman inter - component coupling .",
    "the novelty of the present paper lies in systematic mean field treatment of the disordered @xmath14 model with particular emphasis on the response to the constant magnetic field .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec - bapi_bari_ja ] the ferromagnetic xy model is introduced .",
    "a symmetry breaking random field is added in sect . [ delhi_abhi_door_hai ] and",

    "[ girgiti ] , study the system with an additional constant field and , in particular , show presence of random field - induced order .",
    "we discuss the results in sect .",
    "[ alochona ] , arguing in particular that the analogs of our results will hold for the mean - field version of the classical heisenberg model .",
    "consider a lattice , each site @xmath18 of which is occupied by a `` spin '' , which is a unit vector @xmath19 on a two - dimensional plane ( called the xy plane ) .",
    "the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic xy model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath20 with a coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "this model does not have any spontaneous magnetization , at any temperature , in one and two dimensions ( mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite ) , while a finite magnetization appears in higher dimensions for sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the total number of spins in our system is @xmath22 . in the mean field approximation every spin is assumed to interact with all other spins ( not just with the nearest neighbors ) with the same coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the spin at @xmath18 to the total energy of the system equals @xmath24 where we divided the energy term by @xmath22 in order to preserve its order of magnitude .",
    "this effective interaction , replacing the nearest neighbor interaction in @xmath25 , is for large @xmath22 approximately equal @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the mean field approximation consists of treating @xmath28 as a genuine constant vector and adjusting it so , that the canonical average of the spin at ( any ) site @xmath18 equals this constant . if the system is in canonical equilibrium at temperature @xmath3 , the average value of the spin vector @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "this average is independent of the site @xmath18 .",
    "consistency requires that the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) of the above equation be equal to the magnetization @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we obtain the mean field equation @xmath34 where we have dropped the index @xmath18 . equations of this type , for various modifications of the original interaction are the main subject of this work .",

    "we will now consider the effect of additional quenched random fields .",
    "let us begin by reminding the notions of quenched disorder and quenched averaging .",
    "the disorder considered in this paper is `` quenched '' , i.e. its configuration remains unchanged for a time that is much larger than the duration of the dynamics considered . in the systems that we study , it is the local magnetic fields that are disordered .",
    "they are random variables following certain probability distributions .",
    "since the disorder is quenched , a particular realization of all the random variables remains fixed for the whole time necessary for the system to equilibrate .",
    "an average of a physical quantity , say @xmath56 , is thus to be carried out in the following order .",
    "* compute the value of the physical quantity @xmath56 , with the fixed configuration of the disorder . *",
    "average over the disordered parameters .",
    "this mode of averaging is called `` quenched '' averaging .",
    "it may be mentioned that an averaging in which items ( a ) and ( b ) are interchanged in order , is called `` annealed '' averaging .",
    "physically it corresponds to a situation when the disorder fluctuates on time scales comparable to the system s thermal fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath14 model with an inhomogeneous magnetic field has the interaction : @xmath57 where the two - dimensional vectors @xmath58 are the external magnetic fields , up to a coefficient @xmath39 . in the sequel @xmath58 are random variables of order one , they model the disorder in the system and thus @xmath39 measures the disorder s strength . more precisely , let @xmath58 be independent and identically distributed random variables ( vector - valued ) .",
    "we want to study the effect of including such a random field term in the @xmath14 hamiltonian at small values of @xmath39 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , in lattice @xmath14 models this effect depends critically on the properties of the probability distribution of the random fields .    if the distribution of the @xmath58 is invariant under rotations , there is no spontaneous magnetization at any nonzero temperature in any dimension @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite    we now want to see the effect of a random field that does not have the rotational symmetry of the xy model interaction ( [ eq_hamil ] ) , considering the case when @xmath60 where @xmath61 are scalar random variables with a distribution symmetric about @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes the unit vector in the @xmath64 direction .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that on the two - dimensional lattice such a random field will break the continuous symmetry and the system will magnetize , even in two dimensions , thus destroying the mermin - wagner - hohenberg effect . above two dimensions the pure @xmath14 model magnetizes at low temperatures and",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that the uniaxial random field as described above may enhance this magnetization . in the present paper",
    "we want to study related effects at the level of a simpler , mean - field model , which allows for a more detailed analysis and more accurate simulations .",
    "we consider the mean - field hamiltonian given by @xmath65 where , as @xmath66 before , @xmath67 is the quenched random field in the @xmath64-direction . here",
    "@xmath68 is a scalar , symmetric random variable , which we assume here to be gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath69 is the parameter ( typically small ) that quantifies the strength of the randomness .",

    "it follows from the symmetry of the distribution of @xmath68 that all solutions of the equation ( eq .",
    "( [ meanfield_mag_nonzeroepsi ] ) ) have zero @xmath12-component . in the case of @xmath72 ,",
    "the system again does not magnetize at high temperature , as in the case of @xmath73 .",
    "however , there exists a critical temperature , below which a transverse ( with respect to the direction of the random field ) magnetization appears .",
    "more precisely , there exists a @xmath74 such that for @xmath75 , the magnetization equation has two solutions with zero @xmath12-components , whose @xmath13-components equal @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 ) ( along with the trivial solution @xmath52 ) . we will study the dependence of @xmath76 on the temperature and on the disorder strength @xmath39 .",

    "[ fig_x ] shows that there are ranges in the parameter space @xmath175 , for which the quenched averaged @xmath13-component , @xmath176 , of the magnetization _ increases _ in the presence of disorder , compared to the case when there is no disorder .",
    "as noted before , this is in agreement with our numerical simulations .",
    "we have also considered the effect of disorder on the length @xmath76 and phase @xmath129 of the magnetization . for the phase , we consider the expansion of @xmath177 , which is given by @xmath178 with @xmath179 where @xmath180 with @xmath13 and @xmath12 being given by eqs .",

    "to summarize , we have considered classical systems of two dimensional spins , and studied the interplay between continuous symmetry and symmetry - breaking quenched disordered field , in the mean field approximation .",
    "we found that in case of a system in a uniform magnetic field , disorder may enhance one component of the order parameter .    in this paper ,",
    "we have explicitly considered only the situation when the spins are two - dimensional .",
