    "there has been an increasing interest in the study of spatially extended systems with local and nonlocal interactions to understand almost all complex behaviors in nature .",
    "the analysis of collective behavior of time - delay coupled networks is a topic of great interest for its fundamental significance from a dynamical systems point of view and for its practical relevance in modeling various physical , biological , and engineering systems , such as coupled laser arrays , gene regulatory networks and complex ecosystems@xcite .",
    "realistic modeling of many large networks with nonlocal interaction inevitably requires connection delays to be taken into account , since they naturally arise as a consequence of finite information transmission and processing speeds among the units .",
    "delay systems are in general infinite dimensional and can display complex dynamics and a very little is known yet about the basic relations between network structure and delay dynamics .",
    "the first systematic investigation of delay coupled phase oscillators was done by schuster and wagner@xcite .",
    "delay can give rise to some significant phenomena like synchronization@xcite , multistability@xcite and amplitude death @xcite .",
    "dissipative systems with time delayed feedback can generate high dimensional chaos and the dimension of chaotic attractor can be made larger by increasing delay time @xcite . in neural network and communication network time delays",
    "ubiquitously exist @xcite .",
    "networks with time delay are also very useful for modeling coordinated brain activity @xcite , pattern recognitions etc .",
    "delay can enhance the coherence of chaotic motion@xcite , as well as it can stabilize synchronous state in oscillator network@xcite .",
    "some new phenomena like oscillation death , stabilizing periodic orbits , enhancement or suppression of synchronization , chimera state etc arise due to the time delay@xcite .",
    "so there are strong reasons to shed light on the issue of such systems .",
    "synchronization of coupled map lattice under delay coupling in globally coupled logistic maps@xcite , coupled chaotic maps with inter - neural communication@xcite or intra - neural communication@xcite has been intensively investigated . in modeling many realistic systems of biological ,",
    "technological and physical significance using cml with either nearest neighbor interaction or global coupling is unable to capture all essential features of the dynamics of the extended systems@xcite .",
    "however , in many systems ( for example , communication , ecological , social and contact networks ) links are not always active and the connectivity between the units changes ( stochastically or deterministically ) in time with a rate ranging from slow to fast @xcite",
    ". one can think that time variations of links represent the evolution of interactions over time of the system .",
    "such time - varying interactions are commonly found in social networks , communication , biological systems , spread of epidemics , computer networks , world wide web etc . and have been shown to result in significantly different emergent phenomena @xcite .",
    "+ the synchronization behavior of time delay coupled network with dynamic random updating of links at every time are not yet investigated . in this work ,",
    "we have considered homogeneous delay coupled ring network with stochastic updating of links at every time and investigated the effects of dynamic random updating of links and delay parameter on the synchronization phenomena of the network .",
    "most interestingly , we study the stability of the synchronized state when the underlying network evolves in time taking delay parameter as one unit of time .",
    "we analyze synchronization behavior of dynamic random network with identical local maps .",
    "we consider watts - strogatz ( ws ) networks and vary the fraction of random links @xmath7 to cover a broad range of networks varying from a regular ring topology for @xmath8 to completely random networks for @xmath9 and for intermediate values of @xmath7 , such networks are characterized by small - world networks : small path length and high clustering coefficient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : lev1 ] the model is discussed .",
    "section [ sec : lev2 ] contains linear stability analysis results for complete synchronization .",
    "numerical simulation results are also presented and analyzed in this section .",
    "finally , conclusion is drawn in section [ sec : lev3 ] .",
    "governing equations for delay coupled maps with nearest neighbor interaction over a ring network are the following @xmath10 where , @xmath11 represents the state variable , @xmath12 the integer valued time index , @xmath13 the space index , @xmath14 being the linear size of the array .",
    "@xmath15 is the coupling strength , @xmath16 represents the constant delay time . in our model",
    "every link in the network rewires stochastically and independently in every time step . in particular , at every time update we connect a fraction @xmath7 of randomly chosen sites in the lattice to two other random sites , instead of their nearest neighbors .",
    "then the evolution rule for @xmath7 fraction of nodes of the network are followed by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are random integers uniformly distributed in the set @xmath20 . at the same time the dynamical equation of the time evolution rule for remaining @xmath21 fraction of nodes",
    "are governed by @xmath10 thus @xmath22 corresponds to the usual nearest - neighbor diffusion for all nodes , whereas @xmath23 is related to completely random diffusion . for our present study",
    "we choose one dimensional unimodal smooth map .",
    "in this section , we shall do linear stability analysis of synchronized spatiotemporal fixed point of the dynamic random network of delay coupled maps first .",
    "we consider the case with delay parameter @xmath2 and check the stability of the synchronized spatiotemporal fixed point of the map .",
    "stability analysis of synchronized spatiotemporal fixed point for dynamic random network is relatively complicated since it will involve diagonalization of random matrices . to calculate the stability of the synchronized fixed point",
    ", we will construct an average probabilistic evolution rule for the sites , which becomes a sort of mean field version of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "we assume that the total contribution due to @xmath24 randomly chosen neighbors is @xmath25 in our case , @xmath26 now , the averaged out evolution equation for any site @xmath27 is the following @xmath28 the delayed system ( 4 ) can now be written in following form by introducing a new variable @xmath29 as @xmath30 now it becomes an equation with no delay term . in this way",
    "every coupled map lattice model with homogeneous delay can be easily transformed into an cml with no delay .",
    "synchronization occurs when the state variables of each node adopt the same value for all the coupled maps at all times @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all times greater than a transient time .",
    "a range of the coupling strength may exist for which such a synchronized steady state can be obtained depending on the nature of the individual map and an adequate rewiring probability @xmath7 and delay parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the linear stability analysis of synchronized spatiotemporal steady state of the model ( 5 ) is performed for smooth unimodal maps .",
    "the jacobian matrix for the system ( [ ab ] ) can be cast as @xmath34\\ ] ] where ,    @xmath35 , @xmath36 and + @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "+ to derive the stability condition of the synchronized steady state we will study the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is a block circulant matrix .",
    "it can be reduced to a block diagonal matrix using unitary transformation .",
    "the block diagonal form of @xmath39 is the following @xmath40 where , the matrix @xmath41 are @xmath42 matrices given by @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 . +",
    "after substituting the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , the matrix @xmath49 .",
    "now , @xmath50 can vary between 0 and @xmath51 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath52 are @xmath53 .",
    "if there exist at least one eigenvalue of j greater than 1 for all @xmath15 then the synchronized steady state is not stable for the system ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "this situation appears when @xmath54 and consequently the network has no stable synchronized steady state . on the other hand for @xmath55 of eigenvalues of @xmath52 lie inside the unit circle centered at origin in the complex plane .",
    "also we calculated the eigenvalues of @xmath56 for the case @xmath57 and found them lying within unit circle centered at origin for @xmath55 .",
    "this indicates that for @xmath55 stable synchronized steady state ought to occur ; whereas , for @xmath54 synchronized fixed point can never be achieved .",
    "+ next , we seek the stability criterion of synchronized period-2 orbit of the lattice , which are the period 2 points of the local map .",
    "to do this , we have to find the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a period 2 orbit of the local map .",
    "thus , the jacobian turns out to be @xmath62\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 . + the matrix @xmath68 is also block circulant matrix .",
    "so approaching as above we reach at a block diagonal matrix @xmath69 where , the matrix @xmath70 are @xmath42 matrices given by @xmath71 where , @xmath44 , @xmath72    the eigen values of the matrix + @xmath73 are @xmath74 for the stability of period-2 all the eigenvalues must lie within the unit circle of the complex plane .",
    "i.e. @xmath75 . we check the eigenvalues for @xmath76 between -1 to 1 . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the inequality gives @xmath78 and for @xmath79 , we reach at the inequality @xmath80 where , @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we point out that the period-2 fixed point is stable in the range @xmath82 which implies , @xmath83 the critical coupling strength depends on the properties of the local map and randomness of rewiring @xmath84 and the delay parameter",
    ". the stability range of synchronized period -2 increases monotonically with the randomness of rewiring @xmath84 . notice that this condition is independent of the lattice size @xmath14 . specifically , we take chaotic logistic map @xmath85 having nonzero fixed point @xmath86 . since @xmath87 for this point of the map ,",
    "i.e @xmath54 , period-1 fixed point never synchronizes for this chaotic logistic map .",
    "now , for this map @xmath88 , period-2 fixed points being @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we find that the period-2 fixed point is stable in the range @xmath91 which implies , @xmath92 for fully random coupling the range of stability of synchronized period-2 orbit becomes @xmath93 .      for numerical simulation",
    "we have chosen the logistic map @xmath94 and the lattice size to be 100 .",
    "first we take the delay time to be @xmath2 .",
    "bifurcation diagram of the state variables with the variation of the coupling strength @xmath15 of the lattice for fully random rewiring is drawn in figure [ fg1 ] for @xmath95 and in figure [ fg1b ] @xmath96 .",
    "we observe synchronized fixed point for @xmath96 but synchronized period-2 behavior for a long range of coupling strength for @xmath9 which is consistent with our analytical findings . from numerical simulation",
    "the range of synchronized period-2 orbit is found to be @xmath97 which is very close to the analytically estimated range .",
    "next , we draw the bifurcation diagram of the state variables for @xmath3 .",
    "transition to synchronized fixed point for complete random rewiring is depicted in figure [ fg2 ] .",
    "the nature of bifurcation is the same as the bifurcation of a system without delay .",
    "the bifurcation diagram with the variation of delay time @xmath5 for @xmath98 and @xmath9 is shown in figure [ fg3 ] .",
    "this figure exhibits the existence of synchronized chaos for @xmath4 .     for @xmath2 and @xmath9.,width=288,height=192 ]     for @xmath2 and @xmath9.,width=288,height=192 ]     and @xmath9.,width=288,height=192 ]     with @xmath9.,width=288,height=192 ]    furthermore , we calculate the basin size of synchronization .",
    "if out of @xmath99 random initial conditions synchronization is obtained in @xmath24 cases then basin size will be @xmath100 , i.e the basin size lies between the values 0 and 1 . to compute basin size we have taken 100 random initial conditions .",
    "variation of basin sizes with respect to the coupling strength for different connectivity @xmath9 and @xmath101 are displayed in figure [ fg4 ] .",
    "the range of synchronization increases with the increase in @xmath7 .",
    "for different coupling strength @xmath102 and @xmath103 we plot the basin sizes with the variation of the rewiring probability in figure [ fg5 ] .     and",

    "we have displayed the nature of synchronization error for @xmath9 and @xmath104 .",
    "this shows that for high coupling strength fully synchronized state is achieved irrespective of the nature of the orbit .",
    "we have plot the time series of one site for @xmath9 , @xmath104 and @xmath103 in figure [ fg7 ] to show that chaos is generated at each node for higher delay time .",
    "we confirm the existence of chaos by plotting the poincare first return map in figure [ fg8 ] .     and",

    "we have reported the synchronization behavior of homogeneous time delay coupled one dimensional ring network of unimodal maps in presence of stochastically switching of links .",
    "we have considered homogeneous delay coupled ring network with stochastic updating of links at every time and investigated the effects of dynamic random updating of links and delay parameter and coupling strength on the synchronization phenomena of the network .",
    "the key finding is the analytically derivation of the stability range of the synchronized steady state and synchronize period 2 orbit of the delay coupled cml for @xmath2 .",
    "it is observed that the critical coupling strength for obtaining synchronized period-2 depends on the properties of the local map and randomness of rewiring @xmath84 and the delay parameter .",
    "the stability range of synchronized period -2 increases monotonically with the randomness of rewiring @xmath84 but this condition is independent of the lattice size @xmath14 .",
    "the analytically calculated stability range of synchronized period-2 orbit is in good agreement with the numerical one .",
    "we have taken logistic map for numerical simulations .",
    "the random rewiring of spatial connection has significant effect on spatiotemporal synchronization as usual . either synchronized steady state or synchronized period 2 orbit",
    "is observed for @xmath2 depending on the map parameters .",
    "synchronized period-1 orbit is observed for @xmath3 .",
    "existence of synchronized chaos is reported for @xmath4 .",
    "these results also hold for other smooth unimodal maps .",
    "we calculated the synchronization error to show the spatial synchronization of the nodes .",
    "the time evolution of one node is shown as an evidence of the existence of chaos .",
    "further analysis using poincare first return map confirms chaos .",
    "thus we confirm the existence of synchronized chaos for @xmath4 for higher coupling strength .",
    "the coupling topology can crucially influence the synchronizability of the cml .",
    "in contrast to the non - delayed cml with stochastic updating of links where only synchronized steady state exists ( at strong coupling strength ) @xcite here , because of homogeneous time delay the cml supports wide range of qualitatively different synchronized states including synchronized chaos .",
    "the results presented in this paper may help us to understand the origin of diversity of synchronous dynamical states observed in large number of biological , chemical and social networks , which can emerge either due to finite information transmission delays or small - world topology .",
