    "the study of electron correlation effects in one - dimensional systems have by now attracted the attention of theorists for more than a half - century .",
    "the physical behavior of one - dimensional correlated electron models are expected to be drastically different from that of free electrons @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the basic excitations have a collective character and non - perturbative techniques becomes essential . in this context , electronic lattice models solvable by bethe ansatz have provided relevant insights into the physical properties of such systems @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are integrable extensions of hubbard model derived exploring solutions of the yang - baxter equation with two fermionic and two bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "representative examples are the models associated with the four dimensional representations of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 lie superalgebras @xcite .",
    "we remark that generalizations of the hubbard models based on the quantum deformations of such algebras @xcite as well as on the central extension of @xmath4 @xcite have also been discussed in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical properties of an extended hubbard model based on the quantum deformation of the twisted @xmath1 algebra @xcite .",
    "we recall here that this model appears to provide a lattice regularization of an interesting integrable ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field of two coupled massive dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "though the respective bethe ansatz solution is known @xcite it has not yet been explored to extract information about the physical properties of such lattice electronic model .",
    "following @xcite the model hamiltonian can be re - written as , @xmath6 \\left [ 1- x_{\\sigma}n_{i , -\\sigma } -{\\bar x}_{\\sigma}n_{i+1 , -\\sigma } \\right ] + u\\sum_{i=1}^{l }   n_{i,+ } n_{i,- }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v\\sum_{i=1}^{l } \\left[n_{i,+ } n_{i+1,- } + n_{i,-}n_{i+1,+ } \\right ] + y\\sum_{i=1}^{l } \\left [ c_{i,+}^{\\dagger } c_{i,-}^{\\dagger } c_{i+1,- } c_{i+1,+}+h.c .",

    "the operator @xmath11 represents the number of electrons with spin @xmath12 on the @xmath13-th site .",
    "apart from the standard kinetic hopping amplitude and the on - site coulomb term @xmath14 we see that hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) contains additional interaction terms .",
    "they are the bond - charge hopping amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the coulomb interaction @xmath17 among electrons at nearest - neighbor sites , the spin - spin exchange term @xmath18 , the pair - hopping amplitude @xmath19 besides the chemical potential amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "integrability constraints the couplings of the model on the following one - parameter manifold , @xmath21 where the anisotropy @xmath0 is related to the @xmath22-deformation of @xmath1 by @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the potential @xmath20 is in principle arbitrary since the model conserves the total number of electrons with spin @xmath9 .",
    "however , the invariance of hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) by the superalgebra @xmath24 $ ] fixes a relation between @xmath20 and @xmath0 , namely @xcite @xmath25 considering the parameterization ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) one can relate the spectra of hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) at the points @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , by performing a combination of particle - hole @xmath27 and the parity @xmath28 transformations one is able to find the following relation , @xmath29 due to property ( [ transf ] ) the analysis of the physical properties of hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) subjected to the constraints ( [ const1],[const2 ] ) can be restricted to the anti - ferromagnetic interval @xmath30 . in this work",
    "we shall argue that the low - energy behavior of this model in the regime @xmath31 is that of a conformally invariant theory with central charge @xmath2 .",
    "the point @xmath32 is special since the model reduces to the supersymmetric isotropic @xmath4 extended hubbard model @xcite . in this case",
    "it was argued that though the excitations are gapless the dispersion relations have a non - relativistic branch @xcite .",
    "in fact , we found that for the electronic model ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) the speed of sound of the underlying low - lying excitations is proportional to @xmath33 which vanishes in the @xmath34 limit .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows . in next section",
    "we shall explore the bethe ansatz solution to determine the ground state and the nature of the excitations of the electronic model ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) .",
    "a particular characteristic is that the dispersion relation of charge excitations combines both the behavior of massless and massive degrees of freedom . in section 3",
    "we study that finite - size properties of the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) by both analytical and numerical approach .",
    "we argue that the critical properties are described by a critical line with central charge @xmath2 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath38 of hamiltonian ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) are given in terms of the variables @xmath39 by , @xmath40 to make further progress it is important to identify the distribution of roots @xmath41 on the complex plane which reproduce the low - lying energies of hamiltonian ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) .",
    "this task is performed by first determining the particle number sectors of the low - lying eigenvalues .",
    "this is done by means of brute force diagonalization of the hamiltonian for small chains @xmath42 and a few values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we then compare these eigenvalues with the results coming from the numerical analysis of the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bethe1]- [ spect ] ) . by performing this analysis",
    "we find that the ground state in the regime @xmath31 for @xmath10 even sits in sectors @xmath43 or @xmath44 and therefore it is four - fold degenerated . due to the particle - hole symmetry it is sufficient to determine the respective pattern of the bethe roots @xmath41 for the sector with the minimum possible number of roots . in figure [ roots1 ]",

    "considering this discussion we find convenient to introduce the following variables , @xmath56 where @xmath57 for @xmath58 .    now by substituting eq.([newvar ] ) in the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bethe1],[bethe2 ] ) and afterwards by taking their logarithms we find that the resulting relations for @xmath59 are , @xmath60 and @xmath61 where function @xmath62}$ ] .",
    "let us turn our attention to the physical properties of the model at special point @xmath32 . in this case",

    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ permut ] ) by the bethe ansatz was discussed in the literature since long ago @xcite .",
    "we remark that the respective bethe equations do not follow immediately from eqs.([bethe1],[bethe2 ] ) when @xmath34 due to the peculiar pattern of the bethe roots @xmath94 .",
    "we find , however , that certain properties of the model at @xmath95 can be inferred without the need of using its bethe ansatz solution .",
    "this is done by first investigating the pattern of the ground sate degeneracies of hamiltonian ( [ permut ] ) by means of exact diagonalization up to @xmath45 .",
    "this study has reveled that the ground state sits in many different sectors whose total number of particles is either @xmath10 or @xmath96 .",
    "this tells us the ground state for a given @xmath10 is @xmath97-fold degenerated and that its energy and low - lying excitations can be computed from the particular simple sectors @xmath98 or @xmath99 . because these are typical ferromagnetic states the calculations are rather direct .",
    "denoting by @xmath100 the momentum of an excitation with spin @xmath101 over the state @xmath98 one finds that the corresponding energy is , @xmath102 where for a finite @xmath10 the momenta @xmath103 .    from eq.([disp2 ] ) we conclude that the ground state per site is @xmath104 and that for low momenta @xmath100 the excitation energy are proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the system has a nonrelativistic behavior in accordance with previous works in the literature @xcite .",
    "interesting enough , we observe that such results can also be derived from eqs.([einf],[disp ] ) by taking the limit @xmath34 . to obtain the ground state energy from eq.([einf ] ) we first perform the change of variable @xmath106 and afterwards take the @xmath34 limit . on the other hand",
    ", the dispersion relation @xmath107 follows directly from eq.([disp ] ) by substituting @xmath32 .",
    "we have now the basic ingredients to investigate in next section the finite - size effects in the spectrum of the electronic model ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) for @xmath31 .",
    "the results of previous section suggests us that the generalized hubbard model ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) in the regime @xmath31 is conformally invariant .",
    "this means that the corresponding critical properties can be evaluated investigating the eigenspectrum finite - size corrections @xcite . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the ground state @xmath108 are expected to scale as , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the central charge .    from the excited states",
    "@xmath111 we are able to determine the dimensions @xmath112 of the respective primary operators , namely @xmath113 a first insight on the structure of the finite - size corrections can be obtained by applying the so - called density root method @xcite .",
    "this approach explores the bethe ansatz solution and it makes possible to compute the @xmath114 corrections to the densities of roots @xmath71 .",
    "this method is however only suitable for systems whose ground state and low - lying excitations are described by real roots .",
    "fortunately , this is exactly the situation we have found in section [ sec : thermod ] once the second root is shifted by @xmath49 . considering this subtlety on the root density approach we find that the leading finite - size behavior of the eigenenergies is , @xmath115 + o\\left ( l^{-2 } \\right),\\ ] ] where the dependence of the scaling dimensions @xmath116 on the anisotropy @xmath0 is , @xmath117 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{4 \\gamma ( \\pi-\\gamma ) } \\left [ m^2 + m_{-}^2 -2(1-\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\pi } ) m m_{- } \\right].\\ ] ] as before the integers @xmath65 parameterizes the numbers of electrons @xmath66 with spin @xmath67 .",
    "the indices @xmath118 and @xmath119 characterize the presence of holes in the @xmath120 and @xmath121 distributions and in principle can be integers or half - integers .",
    "this approach is however not able to predict either the possible values for the vortex numbers @xmath122 and @xmath119 as well possible constraints with the corresponding spin - wave integers @xmath123 and @xmath124 . to shed some light on this problem",
    "we shall first study the finite - size effects at the particular point @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath125 we see that all the interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) cancel out and we remain with two coupled free fermion models . in this case standard fourier technique is able to provide us the exact expressions for the low - lying energies in the case of arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "the respective calculations depend on the total number of electrons on the lattice @xmath10 .",
    "we find that when @xmath126 is odd that the expression for the lowest energy in this sector is given by , @xmath127}{\\sin{\\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{l } \\right)}}.\\ ] ] considering the asymptotic expansion of eq.([odd ] ) for large @xmath10 one finds , @xmath128 + o\\left ( l^{-2 } \\right).\\ ] ] by way of contrast when @xmath126 is an even number the lowest energy is , @xmath129 }    { \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{l } \\right)}+ \\frac{\\cos \\left[\\frac{\\pi ( n_{\\sigma}-1)}{l } \\right ] }   { \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{l } \\right)}\\ ] ] whose expansion for large @xmath10 is , @xmath130 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + o\\left ( l^{-2 } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account eqs.([oddbulk],[evenbulk ] ) we see that the expected finite size corrections depend whether the index @xmath123 is an odd or even integer .",
    "in addition , by comparing eqs.([oddbulk],[evenbulk ] ) with the general results ( [ fsc],[dimens ] ) at @xmath125 we clearly see that for @xmath123 odd the numbers @xmath122 and @xmath131 appear to start from zero while for @xmath123 even the lowest allowed value for @xmath122 and @xmath131 is in fact one - half .",
    "this analysis strongly suggests that possible values for the vortex numbers @xmath122 and @xmath119 should satisfy the following rule @xmath132    let us now check if the above proposal remains valid for other values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is done mostly by solving numerically the original bethe equations ( [ bethe1 ] , [ bethe2 ] ) up to @xmath133 . for the excited states whose respective bethe roots are unstable already for moderate values of @xmath10 we have used the data obtained from the numerical diagonalization through the lanczos method .",
    "this numerical work enables us to compute for each @xmath10 the following sequence @xmath134    by extrapolating @xmath135 for several values of @xmath10 we are able to verify the expression ( [ dimens ] ) for @xmath136 and the constraints ( [ const3 ] ) . in tables",
    "[ one ] , [ two ] , and [ three ] we exhibit the finite - size sequence ( [ fssestim ] ) for six lowest dimensions on the even sector to make an extensive check of the less unusual part of the rule ( [ const3 ] ) . for sake of completeness",
    "we also present three conformal dimensions corresponding to the @xmath123 odd sector .",
    "all those numerical results confirm the conjecture ( [ dimens ] , [ const3 ] ) for the finite size properties of the generalized hubbard model ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we shall now proceed with a discussion of the results obtained so far . from section [ sec : thermod ]",
    "we know that the ground state sits in the sectors @xmath137 and @xmath138 or @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "considering the rule ( [ const3 ] ) the corresponding vortex numbers have the lowest possible values @xmath141 and from eqs.([fsc],[dimens ] ) we derive the following finite size behavior , @xmath142 direct comparison between eq.([cc ] ) and eq.([e0 ] ) leads us to conclude that the central charge of the underlying conformal theory is , @xmath143 the conformal dimensions of the primary operators @xmath144 depend on the anisotropy @xmath0 and they should be measured from the ground state @xmath108 . considering eqs.([fsc],[dimens ] ) together with eq.([e0 ] ) we find that they are given by , @xmath145 to our knowlodge , models exhibiting this kind of universality class have so far been found in a not self - adjoint theory based on the deformed @xmath146 symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , the correlated electron system ( [ h]-[const2 ] ) appears to be the first example of a hermitian hamiltonian whose continuum limit is described by a field theory with @xmath2 with continuously varying anomalous dimensions .",
    "the fact that a line of critical exponents with @xmath147 can be realized in terms of hermitian models could be of importance for practical applications in condensed matter such as in the physics of disordered systems .",
    "we have studied the physical properties of an exactly solvable generalization of the hubbard model with free parameter @xmath0 related to the quantum @xmath148 superalgebra where @xmath149 .",
    "we have determined the nature of the ground state and the behavior of the elementary excitations .",
    "the peculiar feature of the model is that the dispersion relation for the charge sector is given in terms of the product of massless and massive energy - momenta relations . in the regime",
    "@xmath150 the low - lying excitations have a relativistic behavior and the underlying conformal theory has central charge @xmath2 and a line of continuously varying exponents . for the particular point",
    "@xmath151 we have argued that basic properties can be obtained without recourse to the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "we expect that this observation remains valid for all integrable models based on the lie superalgebra @xmath152 for arbitrary finite number of bosonic ( @xmath100 ) and fermionic ( @xmath22 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests that the models based on the deformed @xmath152 symmetry may also have excitation modes with dispersion relation exhibiting both massless and massive behaviors .",
