    "soon after the discovery of high-@xmath1 materials it was proposed that , this kind of interesting phenomenon , could be explained by the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations characterizing the phase at small hole doping .",
    "the fact that in this regime the materials are close to a mott - hubbard transition have stimulated an intense scientific activity on the study of simple one band models , like the hubbard model and the @xmath2 model , whose apparent simplicity is very attractive .",
    "however these models represent a still unsolved many - body problem in condensed matter physics , as it is still questioned whether they can have a superconducting ground state in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the so called @xmath3-@xmath4 model is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where the constraint of no double occupancy is understood .",
    "here @xmath6(@xmath7 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the corresponding density operator with @xmath10 , the symbol @xmath11 means summation over nearest neighbors , @xmath4 is the super - exchange coupling and finally the spin density operator @xmath12 is defined by the pauli matrices @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "hereafter periodic boundary conditions are assumed on a lattice containing @xmath15 sites with @xmath16 holes ( @xmath17 electrons ) . in these paper",
    "i will mainly focus on the property of a single hole @xmath18 , which was a subject of a vast literature starting from nagaoka and brinkmann and rice in the early seventies .",
    "this problem is also important because the property of a single hole in a quantum antiferromagnet are experimentally accessible by angle resolved photoemission experiments that quite recently @xcite have reached an high level of resolution and reproducibility especially in two dimensions .",
    "in fact , in absence of hole doping , it is widely accepted that the copper - oxide planes are well described by an effective heisenberg model ( the term proportional to @xmath4 in [ tj ] ) with long range antiferromagnetic order in two dimensions @xcite . when an electron is photoemitted , a single hole is free to propagate in the copper - oxide plane , by hopping from copper site to copper site with matrix elements described by the @xmath3 term in eq.([tj ] ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that interaction with the @xmath19 oxygen bands and other effects can not lead to a qualitative change of the model provided the coulomb repulsion remains large to forbid double occupied sites and properly define the position of the hole in the lattice .",
    "in fact by taking the large @xmath20 limit of the hubbard model , the lower hubbard band is correctly described by the @xmath2 model , which represents therefore a realistic model for the interpretation of photoemission experiments at low energies .",
    "one of the most important property is to understand whether a single hole can propagate as a free particle as in a conventional band insulator . in this case",
    "if an electron is extracted from the lower band it will remains for infinite time with the given hole momentum @xmath21 . within the quasiparticle picture",
    "it is clear that interaction can provide a finite lifetime , but since in an insulator all the possible states in the lower band are occupied there is no phase space for decaying processes at least for the lowest possible excitations . as in the landau theory for fermi liquids",
    "it is then possible to define the so called quasiparticle weight @xmath22 which measures the distance between the many body state @xmath23 of a single hole and the corresponding ground state of the insulator @xmath24 in which a hole has been created with momentum @xmath19 and spin @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the quasiparticle weight is then given by : @xmath27 for a band insulator with no interaction @xmath22 is one by definition , whereas if a quasiparticle picture is well defined @xmath22 remains finite in the infinite volume limit .",
    "a key question is to understand whether in two spatial dimension a quasiparticle theory can be defined for an insulator or if this quantity vanishes with a power law as in one dimension@xcite in particular in an antiferromagnet it is crucial to understand if the scattering with the underlying low energy modes - the spin wave excitations- can lead to some anomalous effect .    by the lehman decomposition of the one particle greens",
    "function @xmath28 the finiteness of the quasiparticle weight @xmath22 determines a @xmath29 function in the spectral weight @xmath30 , which , as mentioned , is experimentally accessible by arpes .",
    "however it is difficult to distinguish , in an experiment , which is biased by the resolution of the electronic device , if a true @xmath31 function exists or if the spectral weight is completely incoherent , i.e. without @xmath31 function contributions .",
    "this @xmath32 function weight @xmath22 occurs at an energy @xmath33 , which represents , within the quasiparticle picture , _ the lowest one hole energy with given momentum @xmath19 _ , and @xmath33 properly describes the energy dispersion of the hole .    in two spatial dimensions",
    "there is no exact solution of the `` one hole problem '' but there is a general believe that the basic dynamical properties of a single hole in a quantum antiferromagnet are well described in the paper by kane lee and read ( klr ) @xcite>. in this work the problem is solved using two main approximations : a large spin limit and a self consistent born approximation to sum the relevant diagrams contributing to the greens function , accounting for the scattering of the hole with the spin - waves . within these approximations",
    "i ) the quasiparticle weight is _ finite _ , ii ) the minimum possible energy @xmath33 is generally at momentum @xmath34 and finally , as a general property coming from the long range antiferromagnetic order , iii ) momenta differing by the wavevector @xmath35 are equivalent both for the energy and for the quasiparticle weight : @xmath36 in the original klr paper there was some speculation that @xmath22 could vanish away from the bottom of the band even within their approximations .",
    "however it was shown later @xcite that @xmath22 is strictly finite for all possible momenta in the brillouin zone as long as @xmath37 .",
    "an accurate determination of the single hole dispersion was recently determined by quantum monte carlo and is essentially in agreement with the klr result .",
    "the minimum of the band at @xmath38 is also confirmed experimentally.@xcite for the quasiparticle weight quantum monte carlo is not accurate enough and , quite recently , the accuracy of the klr theory has been questioned since numerical data obtained with lanczos exact diagonalization up to 26 sites clearly showed that @xmath39 at least for @xmath40.@xcite    i will show in this paper ( and prove for @xmath41 ) that while the spectrum satisfies ( [ afproperty ] ) ( rigorously shown in app .  [ theorem - sec ] using a variational ansaz ) , the quasiparticle weight @xmath42.@xcite this effect induces a kind of fermi volume discontinuity which is consistent with recent experiments by wells . in this work",
    "it was pointed out that the photoemission experiments of insulating antiferromagnetic materials look similar to the corresponding metallic ones.@xcite this simple effect is instead a direct consequence of a singular magnon excitation present in a quantum antiferromagnet which cost zero energy and change the spin by one and the momentum by @xmath0 .",
    "in essence this strange and measurable effect is intimately related to the non commutativity of the order parameter @xmath43 with the total spin @xmath44 . in any mean",
    "field theory one usually selects a direction of the order parameter and in this way the spin is no longer defined for the approximate ground state . in an experiments however the variation of the total spin is measured since the outcoming electrons have a definite spin .",
    "an approach which is capable to work in a basis with definite spin @xmath44 and order parameter @xmath45 allows to deal correctly with the excitations and to determine the sharpness of the photoemission spectra in a quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "i consider the @xmath2 hamiltonian ( [ tj ] ) and follow the formalism recently proposed by angelucci _",
    "et al._.@xcite .",
    "the basic advantage of this approach is the possibility to simplify the local constraint of no doubly occupied sites by extending the hamiltonian to an enlarged space , where the physical subspace , satisfying the constraint , is obtained when the eigenvalue of a spin - operator @xmath46 is maximum . in this representation",
    "the @xmath2 hamiltonian matrix reads@xcite , @xmath47 \\chi_{r , r+\\tau_\\mu}.\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are canonical spinless fermion operators creating or annihilating a hole at site @xmath50 and commuting with the corresponding spin operators @xmath51 .",
    "moreover @xmath52 is the hole number at the site @xmath50 , @xmath53 being the total number of holes , and the operator @xmath54 interchanges two @xmath55-spins at sites @xmath50 and @xmath56 . hereafter periodic boundary conditions over a finite hyper - cubic box with linear size @xmath57 and number of sites @xmath58 is assumed .",
    "the constant shift of the energies @xmath59 , which represents the classical contribution of an antiferromagnetic nel state , is also omitted .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ tjant ] ) is naturally defined in a space where there is a single spin for each site and the hole can be created over each spin site by @xmath60 . however the spin value at the position of the holes is clearly unphysical because in the physical hilbert space the hole does not carry spin . as anticipated",
    "this difficulty can be easily solved because the hamiltonian leaves invariant the physical subspace of states where the spins over the sites occupied by the holes are all frozen to @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) .",
    "in fact the following pseudo - spin operator , measuring the total spin at the positions of the holes , and satisfying the algebra of the angular momentum @xmath63 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ tjant ] ) and the invariant subspace with maximum spin @xmath64 , coincides with the physical hilbert space of the @xmath2 model , where the two models have the _ same _ matrix elements , i.e. they identically coincide .",
    "analogously the physical total spin has to be measured where there are no holes and within the present formalism it is defined by : @xmath65 even this operator commutes with the hamiltonian and obviously with the pseudo - spin @xmath46 . in the following sections the total spin @xmath66 will be introduced too .",
    "any eigenstate @xmath67 of the hamiltonian can be labeled by six quantum numbers :    * the number of holes @xmath16 * the value of the physical spin @xmath68 and its component on the z - axis @xmath69 * the value of the pseudo - spin @xmath70 and its component on the z - axis @xmath71 * the total lattice momentum @xmath19 of the state .    and",
    "the physical sector is obtained when @xmath72 .",
    "correlation functions are expectation value of operators @xmath73 over these eigenstates @xmath74 .",
    "if such an operator commutes with the total spin @xmath75 or the pseudo - spin @xmath46 -as , say , the hamiltonian- the corresponding expectation value does not depend on the spin component on the z - axis @xmath69 or @xmath71 . in particular all the eigenstates differing by the quantum number @xmath71 or @xmath69 are degenerate .    at the end of this section",
    "we remind that a state @xmath76 with definite lattice momentum @xmath19 is an eigenstate of the translation operator @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 the operator @xmath77 is the translation operator that brings the origin @xmath79 to the lattice point @xmath50 .",
    "it is formally defined by the following relations valid for any @xmath50 and @xmath56 : @xmath80 the lattice momentum @xmath19 is defined in the brillouin zone ( bz ) with each component @xmath81 ( the lattice constant is one ) .",
    "an important region contained in the previous one is the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz@xmath82 ) defined as the locus of points such that @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "in a quantum antiferromagnet the most important quantities for the correct description of the low energy physics are the order parameter @xmath43 and the total spin @xmath75 , that , within our formalism , read : @xmath85 where @xmath0 is the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath86    the commutation rules of these two operators are well known@xcite : @xmath87 & = & i \\epsilon_{j , k , l } m_l \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ s_j , s_k \\right ] & = & i \\epsilon_{j , k , l } s_l   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ m_j , m_k \\right ]   & = &   { i \\over l^2 } \\epsilon_{j , k , l } s_l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in particular using the above relations it is easy to obtain the commutation of @xmath88 or @xmath89 and @xmath90 with the total spin @xmath44 : @xmath91 & = & -2 m_z s^{+ } + 2 m^{+ } ( 1+s_z ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\left[\\vec s^2 , m^{- } \\right ] & = & 2 m_z s^{- } + 2 m^{- } ( 1-s_z ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\left[\\vec s^2 , m_z \\right ] & = & m^- s^+ - m^+ s^- + 2 m_z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the operator @xmath92 commutes with @xmath44 and @xmath69 . in the following",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath45 also commutes with the hamiltonian since if long range order sets in @xmath45 becomes a macroscopic classical variable in the infinite volume limit.@xcite then we may classify the eigenstates in terms of the four quantum numbers @xmath93 , @xmath69 , @xmath45 and the total lattice momentum of the eigenstate .",
    "suppose that an eigenstate @xmath94 is given with total momentum @xmath95 , definite spin @xmath68 and maximum azimuthal spin @xmath96 , ( all the other @xmath69 component can be easily obtained by a repeated application of the total spin lowering operator @xmath97 ) , it will be shown in the following that the state @xmath98 has spin @xmath99 , @xmath100 , the same order parameter @xmath45 but momentum @xmath101 .",
    "the change of momentum is easily understood since @xmath102 , yielding @xmath103 whereas by applying ( [ comms2 m ] ) : @xmath104   \\right )   |s , m^2,p>= ( s+1 ) ( s+2 ) m^{+ } |s , m^2,p > , \\ ] ] i.e. @xmath105 is a state with definite spin equal to @xmath99 .",
    "analogously @xmath69 is defined since , by @xmath106 = m^{+}$ ] , it follows @xmath107 .",
    "finally @xmath45 does not change by applying @xmath108 to the state @xmath109 as @xmath110=0 $ ] .",
    "0.25 truecm    by the simple assumption that @xmath92 commutes with the hamiltonian for @xmath111 , it has been derived that all the different spin sectors are degenerate and the momentum is defined modulo @xmath0 . in a finite system",
    "this degeneracy is slightly removed and in fact the energy spectrum as a function of the spin behaves as a free quantum rotator spectrum determined by the value of its static susceptibility @xmath112@xcite : @xmath113 instead by spin - wave theory the magnon excitations are characterized by much larger energy costs @xmath114 .",
    "it seems therefore exact at least at low enough energies that the tower of states with different spin can be considered degenerate for @xmath111 , when @xmath45 becomes classical . in a bipartite lattice without holes the spin is integer and the lowest eigenstates with @xmath115 can be obtained by applying @xmath116 times the operator @xmath108 to the singlet spectrum of eigenstates @xmath117 : @xmath118 in particular , from @xmath119 modulo @xmath120 , odd integer spin have the lowest energy state with momentum @xmath0 , whereas even spin have vanishing momentum ( referenced to the singlet momentum which is @xmath121 or @xmath0 according to the parity of @xmath122 respectively ) .    in presence of a single hole or an odd number of holes",
    "the spin is half odd integer ( for half odd integer spin @xmath123 ) and the minimum one is @xmath124 .",
    "consequently the eigenstate with minimum spin , generator of all the tower of states in ( [ iterspectrum ] ) , has non vanishing spin @xmath125 . in this case",
    "a further operator is relevant to generate all the manifold of degenerate states since by applying @xmath126 to an element @xmath109 of the tower ( [ iterspectrum ] ) one gets a different state with the same spin ( due to the rotationally invariant expression @xmath126 , commuting with the total spin ) but momentum @xmath127 : @xmath128 in fact , by using ( [ defcomm ] ) , the operator @xmath126 commutes with @xmath108 and obviously annihilates any singlet state .",
    "hence the expression ( [ psisames ] ) defines non vanishing states only in the half - odd integer spin case where the lowest spin state of the tower has @xmath125 .",
    "the new relation ( [ psisames ] ) can not be iterated as the previous one ( [ iterspectrum ] ) , because the square of the operator @xmath129 when applied to the generator state @xmath130 behaves as a constant equal to @xmath131 .",
    "in fact @xmath132 + { ( \\vec s)^2 \\over 2 l^2 } $ ] and @xmath133 on a spin-@xmath134 state .",
    "the final diagram of the tower of degenerate states ( or almost degenerate states at finite size ) are shown in the following diagram : @xmath135 we expect therefore that for odd number of holes and fixed spin ( and maximum azimuthal spin ) all the spectrum is characterized by _",
    "couples _ of eigenstates with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath127 related by the approximate expression ( [ psisames ] )",
    ".    indeed for the single hole case it can be rigorously shown ( see app .  [ theorem - sec ] ) that the lowest eigenstates with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath127 differ in energy by terms less than @xmath136 .",
    "moreover the relation ( [ psisames ] ) between such a couple of states is _ exact _ within the assumption that in any subspace with given spin and momentum the gap to the first excited state scales as @xmath114 ( one has to excite at least one @xmath137 magnon in this case ) , i.e. much larger than the energy accuracy @xmath136 of the state  ( [ psisames ] ) . in the next section ( [ exactj2 t ] ) it will be shown that eq .",
    "( [ psisames ] ) is indeed consistent with the exact solution obtained for momenta @xmath138 and @xmath139 at the supersymmetric point @xmath41.@xcite    the general character of the spectrum in a quantum antiferromagnet does not depend upon doping if long range magnetic order exists with finite momentum @xmath0 .",
    "however the basic relation ( [ psisames ] ) is expected to be only approximate at finite doping , because charge excitations with energy cost @xmath140 are known to exist ( invalidating the assumption of a gap scaling as @xmath141 ) , as it is also clear from the weak coupling theory in the hubbard model .",
    "it is a luck that for a single hole , charge excitations are forbidden by the requirement of fixed total momentum , and relation ( [ psisames ] ) is asymptotically exact for the lowest possible energy in each subspace with given momentum .",
    "lowest energy eigenstates with momenta differing by @xmath0 are characterized by quite different eigenfunctions satisfying relation ( [ psisames ] ) . in two dimension momenta @xmath19 and @xmath127",
    "are equivalent by spatial symmetry on the surface of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "thus one expects some discontinuity or at least some singularity as the momentum of the hole crosses the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "this should hold at least for physical quantities , like the quasiparticle weight ( see sec .",
    "[ qpweight ] ) , explicitly depending on the momentum dependent lowest energy state @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ tjant ] ) is translation invariant and the most general one - hole state with total lattice momentum @xmath142 ( hole momentum @xmath19 ) can be written : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a pure spin state without holes , i.e. @xmath145 .    the state @xmath76 in ( [ state ] ) represents the most general one - hole state ( @xmath18 ) with given hole momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the action of any translation invariant operator @xmath73 over the state @xmath76 does not change the momentum of the resulting state @xmath146 and is therefore equivalent to the action of an effective spin operator @xmath147 acting on @xmath144 , defined by : @xmath148 for instance consider the kinetic term of the hamiltonian ( [ tjant ] ) along one particular direction @xmath149 : @xmath150 using that the state @xmath144 and all the translated ones @xmath151 contain no holes @xmath152 , @xmath153 is easily computed : @xmath154 then changing @xmath155 in the dummy summation and using the translation operator rule @xmath156 : @xmath157 where in the latter equality @xmath158 comes directly from ( [ translation ] ) .",
    "finally , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ oeff ] ) , it follows that : @xmath159    analogously it is a simple algebra to show that the effective spin hamiltonian reads : @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the translation invariant heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath162 the total spin @xmath163 of the effective spin hamiltonian remains unchanged with respect to the old definition ( [ spintot ] ) and measures the total spin in the whole lattice including the origin site @xmath79 , whereas the pseudo - spin @xmath46 , the physical spin @xmath75 and the staggered magnetization @xmath43 turn in : @xmath164    the pseudo - spin and the physical spin operators commute with the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , as it is easy to check .",
    "thus there is a one to one correspondence of any eigenstate of the effective spin hamiltonian with any single - hole eigenstate with given momentum of the extended hamiltonian ( [ tjant ] ) .",
    "the identification of the true eigenstates of the @xmath2 model is in this case trivial , because the total pseudo - spin @xmath15 is fixed to @xmath165 and the extended hamiltonian does not have eigenstates with unphysical pseudo - spin @xmath166 .",
    "this property is valid only for the one hole case as it is discussed in @xcite .    in the following",
    "it will be established a correspondence between the eigenstates of the well known heisenberg hamiltonian and the eigenstates of @xmath167 . to this purpose",
    "it is convenient to use the total spin @xmath168 and its @xmath169 component @xmath170 as good quantum numbers for the eigenstates @xmath171 of ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the total spin of the effective hamiltonian @xmath172 corresponds to the sum of the physical spin with the pseudospin .",
    "it commutes with the hamiltonian but does not commute with each component of the pseudospin @xmath173 .",
    "in order to have a definite total spin @xmath174 , each eigenstate with physical spin @xmath68 ( with all the degenerate @xmath175 components ) has to combine with the two values of the spin at the origin , yielding eigenstates , with total spin @xmath176 and with @xmath177 , by the well known addition relations of angular momenta . after projecting each eigenstate @xmath178 onto the ones with definite @xmath179 ,",
    "i.e @xmath180 the physical spin of the corresponding hole eigenstates ( [ state ] ) is @xmath181 .",
    "the physical spin is thus univocally determined to be @xmath125 in the singlet total spin @xmath182 subspace .",
    "it is possible to avoid any ambiguity by restricting all the following analysis to this subspace , which in turn is important for the analysis of photoemission experiments in stechiometric compounds .",
    "in fact these experiments determine the imaginary part of the greens function , that , at half filling , reads : @xmath183 , i.e. it is obtained by creating a hole over the singlet antiferromagnetic state @xmath24.@xcite thus only the singlet subspace of the effective hamiltonian is relevant for the calculation of the greens function in an antiferromagnetic insulator .    in the singlet subspace",
    "we can use the total spin @xmath174 to classify the spin of the elementary excitations , analogously to what was done in the 1d heisenberg model where the spinons have been found to carry spin @xmath184.@xcite    the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is exact , and the presence of the translation operator makes difficult to use standard approaches as for the simpler @xmath161 .",
    "the recent ansaz@xcite proposed by shraiman and siggia corresponds to a variational semiclassical solution of the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , yielding for example the nel state for @xmath161 .",
    "however in the one hole case the semiclassical solution can not be controlled by the small parameter @xmath185 , important to derive the spin - wave limit for the heisenberg model.@xcite",
    "after the introduction of the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) the greens function ( [ greenfun ] ) is easily expressed as an expectation value of a spin operator acting on the heisenberg ground state @xmath24 .",
    "the state @xmath186 is of the form ( [ state ] ) , if we choose @xmath187 with : @xmath188 due to the correspondence of eigenstates between @xmath167 and @xmath189 , we can expand @xmath144 in terms of eigenstates of @xmath167 and easily check that the propagation of @xmath190 with the effective hamiltonian , @xmath191 , corresponds exactly to the propagation of @xmath192 with the exact @xmath2 hamiltonian and the greens function immediately follows : @xmath193 using that @xmath194 , that the commutator @xmath195 $ ] vanishes and that @xmath196 does not depend on @xmath25 , we get , after fourier transform @xmath197 , @xmath198 the factor @xmath134 is usually omitted in the literature of strong coupling theories like the @xmath2 model , probably for estetic reasons of normalizations . here",
    "we are interested to the actual photoemission delta weight and we are not allowed to use misleading normalizations .",
    "once @xmath167 is diagonalized by eigenstates @xmath199 with total vanishing spin @xmath200 and energies @xmath201 the greens function is obtained by inserting this complete set of eigenstates in ( [ greenp ] ) : @xmath202    a general relation satisfied by the greens function of a single hole in an antiferromagnet directly follows from the property that the lowest eigenstate @xmath203 of @xmath204 can be written in term of the eigenstate @xmath23 of @xmath167 using relation ( [ psisames ] ) and ( [ defmeff ] ) valid at low energy , i.e. @xmath205 where in the latter equalities we have used that @xmath206 are singlet states and we have neglected the @xmath207 difference between the physical staggered magnetization @xmath208 ( [ defmeff ] ) and the one acting over all the sites @xmath209 .",
    "a simple normalization is then possible using eq .",
    "( [ normms0 ] ) , and by neglecting @xmath207 contributions one obtains consistently : @xmath210 .",
    "in the imaginary part of ( [ greenlehman ] ) some of the @xmath31 function weights may remain finite for @xmath111 and define the so called quasiparticle weight @xmath22 , which is usually a single peak located at the bottom of the finite size spectrum@xcite .",
    "all the other part of the spectrum merge in a continuum of states for @xmath211 leading to an incoherent spectral function .    using ( [ greenlehman ] ) the quasiparticle weight is given by : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the lowest energy singlet state of the hamiltonian @xmath214 .",
    "notice that the quasiparticle weight in a strong coupling theory can not exceed the value @xmath134 since it is obviously bounded by the value of the momentum distribution @xmath215 .",
    "notice that using ( [ defs0q ] ) @xmath216 can be expressed in the following form : @xmath217 this is an asymptotically exact relation for @xmath218 , as long as @xmath219 , i.e. within the assumption of long range magnetic order .",
    "another important quantity to study is the current operator , which is useful when we calculate the transport properties . on a discrete lattice , the current operator corresponding to a uniform field is defined by@xcite : @xmath220\\ ] ] in terms of spinless fermion hole operators @xmath221 and spin interchange ones @xmath222 the total current",

    "of course a factor @xmath233 have been dropped out in the previous expressions for the conductivity because there is only a single charge allowed to move . at small",
    "doping the conductivity will be proportional to the number of carriers times the conductivity of the single hole , i.e. will be finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "at the supersymmetric point for @xmath41 the kinetic part proportional to @xmath3 is exactly canceled by the magnetic bonds around the origin in ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "in fact any eigenstate @xmath234 of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath161 with total momentum @xmath235 is an exact eigenstate of ( [ heff ] ) with the same hole momentum @xmath19 and energy @xmath33 .",
    "in fact by assumption @xmath236 and @xmath237 , and immediately follows that : @xmath238    the collection of all possible one hole states with arbitrary hole momentum has clearly an hilbert space dimension @xmath239 times the dimension of the heisenberg model . thus the heisenberg eigenstates with all possible momenta @xmath240 are not a complete set for the one hole hilbert space .",
    "it is remarkable however that for @xmath41 a considerable fraction ( @xmath241 ) of all the eigenstates is exactly known and indeed coincide with the ones of @xmath161 .",
    "i have verified numerically up to @xmath242 site 2d - lattice that the lowest - energy one - hole eigenstates with momentum @xmath138 or @xmath243 are of the previous type , i.e. particular eigenstates of the heisenberg model . for @xmath138 in",
    "_ any _ spatial dimension the singlet spin state @xmath144 characterizing the single hole eigenstate ( [ state ] ) coincides with the true ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath24 , the quasiparticle weight is exactly one and exhausts all the spectral weight , @xmath244 .",
    "an interesting feature instead is when the momentum of the hole coincides with the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the singlet state @xmath144 characterizing the lowest possible one hole eigenstate with momentum @xmath0 can be obtained using the first excitation of the heisenberg model , which has momentum @xmath0 and is a triplet : @xmath245 , where @xmath112 is the static spin susceptibility of the heisenberg model .",
    "the above states can be combined with the operator @xmath246 which commutes with the hamiltonian , leading to nine different spin eigenstates @xmath247 for @xmath248 with the same energy and with spin components on the @xmath249 subspaces . by a proper linear combination of these states",
    "it is then possible to select an exact singlet eigenstate in the following way : @xmath250 where the normalization constant is easily computed , yielding : @xmath251    after a little algebra , using that both @xmath24 and @xmath252 have definite momenta , the overlap of this state with the heisenberg ground state is : @xmath253 , leading , by means of the schwartz inequality , to : @xmath254 where the latter equality follow from @xmath24 being a singlet , yielding @xmath255 .",
    "the above inequality ( [ defz0q ] ) is an upper bound for @xmath256 , but represents an exact equality in the infinite size limit .",
    "in fact after a little algebra the state ( [ defs0q ] ) with @xmath257 saturates the bound ( [ defz0q ] ) , and represents the true eigenstate with momentum @xmath0 within the only assumption that the finite size gap in each sector of definite total spin and momentum scales as @xmath258 ( see app.[theoremcons - subsec ] ) .",
    "this basic assumption has been verified numerically as it is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath259 and @xmath260 for various momenta .",
    "in particular in the static limit @xmath259 the spin wave prediction of this gap always underestimates the value of the true gap computed by exact diagonalization on small lattices . in spin",
    "wave theory this gap scales as @xmath141 since the perturbation induced by the hole affects only by small shift the bare spin wave energy excitation @xmath261 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath261 depends linearly with momentum @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is the spin - wave velocity , and the lowest gap is given by @xmath264 . a plot of the quasiparticle weight for momentum @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "2 indicating that the finite size estimate of this quantity is strongly size dependent and without an exact result @xmath265 it would be difficult to decide whether @xmath256 remains finite in the infinite size limit .",
    "this is in general the case for @xmath266 , where the situation is still unclear and controversial so far .",
    "the exact determination of the quasiparticle weight , obtained for particular wavevectors and @xmath41 has evidenced a more general property of the greens function in an insulator with long range magnetic order .",
    "in fact hole momenta differing by the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath0 are in general characterized by the same energy in the infinite size limit , but with a quite different quasiparticle weight .",
    "the two one hole eigenstates with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath127 inside or outside the magnetic brillouin zone respectively , have in fact a substantially different overlap with the heisenberg ground state , because they are essentially derived from two _ orthogonal _ states : the heisenberg ground state , and the corresponding lowest triplet excitation , respectively .",
    "this property is clearly a general one , valid for all momenta : in fact the relation between the lowest singlet eigenstates of @xmath214 can be written , analogously to eq .",
    "( [ defs0q ] ) , : @xmath267 at the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone , momenta differing by @xmath0 are equivalent by spatial symmetries .",
    "then arbitrary close to this surface there should be at least a singularity in the quasiparticle weight , because the lowest energy state change dramatically even with an arbitrary small variation of momentum .",
    "it is reasonable to expect a jump of the quasiparticle weight that according to ( [ defz0q ] ) is given approximately by :    @xmath268 where we have used that in the heisenberg antiferromagnet the numerical value for the 2d order parameter is @xmath269.@xcite",
    "in this work i have discussed a general property of quantum antiferromagnets that can be detected by well resolved photoemission experiments that are determined by the low energy dynamic of a single hole in the undoped material .",
    "contrary to the existing folklore considering the single hole problem as an old , boring and solved issue@xcite , it is found here that at least an effect has been overlooked by the previous literature , effect that has been recently observed in the photoemission experiments by wells et al . and",
    "were independently predicted in @xcite .",
    "such experiments have evidenced the surprising effect that the photoemission spectra of a quantum antiferromagnet apparently show up the presence of a fermi surface as in the corresponding metal at finite doping .    in the present work",
    "this fact is a consequence of a zero - energy magnon excitation carrying the antiferromagnetic - wavevector momentum and having an infinite lifetime in an antiferromagnet .",
    "this magnon is present in the ground state of the hole for momenta outside the brillouin zone , while is absent in the other momentum region .",
    "the matrix elements entering in the spectral weight measured experimentally is jumping discontinuously along the mentioned surface separating the two momentum regions .",
    "this effect is just indicating the presence of this anomalous excitation .",
    "this kind of excitation is washed out in any mean field treatment since as discussed in the introduction , in such a case the direction of the order parameter is fixed and the spin is no more a measurable quantity .",
