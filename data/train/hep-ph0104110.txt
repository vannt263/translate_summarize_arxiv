    "the study of nonleptonic two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons is of primary importance for the exploration of cp violation and the determination of the flavour parameters of the standard model . because of the interference of several competing amplitudes , these processes allow for the presence of different weak and strong - interaction phases , which play a crucial role for cp violation . in the standard model ,",
    "all cp - violating observables are related to the complex phase of the quark mixing matrix , which in turn implies nontrivial angles in the `` unitarity triangle '' @xmath10 . with the standard choice of phase conventions",

    ", @xmath14 can be extracted in a theoretically clean way by measuring the time - dependent rates for the decays @xmath15 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) is more difficult , since it requires controlling the hadronic dynamics in nonleptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "a promising strategy for the determination of @xmath2 is based on rate measurements for the charged modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "hadronic uncertainties in this method can be reduced to a minimum by exploiting the structure of the effective weak hamiltonian and using isospin and su(3 ) flavour symmetries @xcite .",
    "if only measurements of cp - averaged branching ratios are available , it is still possible to derive bounds on @xmath2 @xcite , or to determine @xmath2 under the assumption of only a moderate strong - interaction phase @xmath18 between penguin and tree amplitudes .",
    "a different strategy for extracting @xmath2 uses su(3)-symmetry relations between the various contributions to the time - dependent @xmath19 and @xmath20 decay amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical limitation of these methods is in the accuracy with which the effects of su(3 ) breaking can be estimated .",
    "the angle @xmath3 can be determined from the time - dependent cp asymmetry in the decays @xmath21 , if the subdominant penguin contribution to the decay amplitudes can be subtracted in some way .",
    "this can be achieved by an isospin analysis @xcite ; however , in practice that route is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in measuring the very small @xmath22 branching ratios .",
    "one must therefore rely on dynamical input for the penguin - to - tree ratio @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath3 can be measured in related decays such as @xmath23 , for which the penguin contribution can be eliminated using a time - dependent analysis of the @xmath24 dalitz plot @xcite .",
    "most of the above - mentioned determinations of @xmath2 or @xmath3 have theoretical limitations , which would be reduced if some degree of theoretical control over two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 decays could be attained . however , in the past this has proven to be a very difficult problem .",
    "even advanced methods such as lattice gauge theory , qcd sum rules , or the large-@xmath25 expansion have little to say about the qcd dynamics relevant to hadronic @xmath0 decays . in recent work ,",
    "we have developed a systematic approach to this problem .",
    "it is based on the observation that , in the heavy - quark limit @xmath26 , a rigorous qcd factorization formula holds for the two - body decays @xmath27 , if the `` emission particle '' @xmath28 ( the meson not obtaining the spectator quark from the @xmath0 meson ) is a light meson .",
    "( it has been argued that perhaps the large-@xmath25 limit may be more relevant to factorization than the heavy - quark limit @xcite .",

    "the conceptual foundations of our approach have been discussed in detail in @xcite , which focused on the simpler case of decays into heavy  light final states ( where @xmath35 is a charm meson ) . in the present work , the qcd factorization formula is applied to the general case of @xmath0 decays into a pair of light , flavour - nonsinglet pseudoscalar mesons .",

    "this is a straightforward extension of our previous analysis .",
    "however , a sensible implementation of qcd corrections to electroweak penguin matrix elements implies that one departs from the usual renormalization - group counting , in which the initial conditions for the electroweak penguin operators at the scale @xmath37 are treated as a next - to - leading order effect .",

    "+ +    hard - scattering kernels are derived for general , asymmetric meson light - cone distribution amplitudes .",

    "+ +    the leading power corrections to the heavy - quark limit are estimated by analyzing `` chirally - enhanced '' power corrections related to certain twist-3 distribution amplitudes for pseudoscalar mesons .",

    "our main focus here is on the development of the new conceptual aspects of the approach that are important for a comprehensive phenomenological analysis .",
    "this includes a detailed discussion of various sources of potentially large power corrections to the heavy - quark limit .",
    "we then perform a comprehensive study of cp - averaged branching fractions and direct cp asymmetries in decays to @xmath38 and @xmath39 final states , including a detailed discussion of the theoretical uncertainties from all inputs to the qcd factorization approach . in many of the phenomenological applications discussed in this work the dynamical information obtained using the qcd factorization formalism",
    "is used in a `` minimal way '' , to reduce the hadronic uncertainties in methods that are theoretically clean up to `` nonfactorizable '' su(3)-breaking effects .",
    "most importantly , these strategies do not suffer from uncertainties related to weak annihilation contributions . in this way , it is possible to reduce the hadronic uncertainties in the strategies for determining @xmath2 from @xmath40 decays proposed in @xcite to the level of `` nonfactorizable '' corrections that simultaneously violate su(3 ) symmetry and are power suppressed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "these corrections are parametrically suppressed by the product of three small quantities : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath34 . as a consequence ,",
    "we argue it will eventually be possible to determine @xmath2 with a theoretical accuracy of about @xmath43 ( unless @xmath2 is much different from its expected value in the standard model ) .",
    "more accurately , the strategies discussed here can constrain the wolfenstein parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 with accuracies similar those obtained from the standard global fit to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath0@xmath48 mixing .",
    "given the theoretical input discussed in this paper even the present , preliminary data on the rare hadronic decays exclude at 95% confidence level half of the parameter space obtained from the standard fit .    the qcd factorization approach provides a complete theoretical description of all @xmath49 decay amplitudes .",
    "this allows for a large variety of predictions , which go far beyond those explored in the present work . in the future",
    ", this will offer the possibility of several nontrivial experimental tests of the factorization formula .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these predictions will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we collect some basic formulae and express the @xmath1 decay amplitudes in terms of parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 appearing in the effective , factorized transition operators for these decays ( including weak annihilation contributions ) . section  [ sec:3 ] contains the technical details of the calculations based on the factorization formula , a discussion of annihilation effects , and a compilation of the relevant formulae for the numerical evaluation of our results .",

    "the reason is that the electroweak penguin contributions in @xmath31 decays and other rare processes based on @xmath36 transitions are important only because they compete with strongly ckm - suppressed tree topologies .",
    "electroweak penguins and tree topologies together are responsible for the isospin - violating contributions to the decay amplitudes @xcite .",

    "therefore , we expect that with more precise data the values of the two ratios in ( [ isospin ] ) will come closer to each other .",
    "finally , we wish to stress that the difference between the qcd factorization results and naive factorization are largest for the ratio of the @xmath206 and @xmath207 final states . whereas we can accommodate the low experimental value of this ratio for @xmath208 ( at the @xmath205 level ) , this would not be possible for any value of @xmath2 if one were to use the naive factorization model .",

    "this shows that for future analyses of rare @xmath0 decays it will be important to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the value of @xmath46 .",
    "we can unfold the strong dependence of the ratios on @xmath209 by presenting the predictions for the branching fractions as functions of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "the circular contours reflect the increase of the @xmath206 branching fraction with @xmath46 .",

    "hence , the width of each band thus reflects the ( largely irreducible ) theory uncertainty given a certain value of the observable , while the current constraint on @xmath44 and @xmath45 provided by each observable separately can roughly be taken to be the entire region bounded by the two light - shaded bands .      the information from all cp - averaged @xmath1 branching fractions ( and , in the future , from the corresponding cp asymmetries )",
    "can be combined into a single global fit , giving regions for the wolfenstein parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 that are allowed by theory .",
    "we will now determine these regions , using two slightly different treatments of theoretical uncertainties . because our focus is to determine fundamental parameters of the standard model , we adopt a more conservative error analysis than in the previous paragraphs of this section and scan all theory input parameters over their respective ranges of uncertainty ( rather than adding theoretical uncertainties in quadrature ) .",
    "the same conservative treatment was used in the analysis of the weak phase @xmath2 in section  [ sec : nr ] .",
    "it is evident from our previous discussion that ratios of cp - averaged branching fractions provide the most powerful constraints on the wolfenstein parameters , since they are afflicted with relatively small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , there are two reasons for not performing a global fit to the ratios directly ( see also the discussion in appendix  c of @xcite ) : first , with the present large experimental errors there are significant differences in the results of the fit depending on whether the ratios or inverse ratios are used , leading to an element of arbitrariness ; secondly , even if two quantities have gaussian errors , their ratio does not .",
    "it is therefore preferable to perform the global fit for the individual branching ratios , despite the fact that the predictions for the branching fractions have larger ( and correlated ) theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we now present two versions of such a fit . in the first method , we find the allowed region from @xmath44 and @xmath45 by determining first the 95% confidence level contour for a given theoretical input , and then scanning over all models in the theory parameter space that survive a 5% confidence cut .",

    "the constraint corresponding to @xmath233 is indicated by the solid annulus .",
    "a fit to cp - averaged branching fractions can not distinguish between @xmath45 and @xmath234 , and so for simplicity only the upper half of the @xmath4 plane is shown in the figure . at present our contours are symmetric about the @xmath44 axis . in the future",
    ", data on direct cp asymmetries in the various @xmath1 modes should be included in the fit , in which case it will become possible to obtain information about the sign of @xmath45 .    before interpreting the results of this analysis",
    ", we discuss a second method for performing the global fit , which follows the strategy outlined in @xcite .",
    "it differs from the method explained above in two ways .",
    "first , the large overall scale uncertainty ( of almost 40% ) due to the error on the value of the form factor @xmath235 , which is common to the theoretical predictions for all branching fractions ( see , e.g. , ( [ brs ] ) ) , is eliminated by fitting the form factor to the data . in that way , the sensitivity to the wolfenstein parameters in increased in the same way as it would be by using ratios ; however , the statistical problems of using ratios ( see above ) are avoided .",
    "specifically , we start from the @xmath236 function @xmath237 where @xmath238 are the experimental values for the branching ratios , @xmath239 are their errors , and @xmath240 are the corresponding theoretical predictions obtained with the fixed form factor @xmath241 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath242 parameterizes the deviations of the product @xmath243 from its central value . for a given set of theory parameters , we determine @xmath244 such that @xmath245 is minimized , provided that the value of @xmath242 is allowed by the theory ranges for the form factor ( see table  [ tab : inputs ] ) and @xmath228 . for most choices of theory parameters",
    "this condition is satisfied .",
    "if it is not , we choose the value of @xmath242 inside the allowed range that is closest to the optimal value in ( [ sdet ] ) .",
    "next , we scan over all theory parameters and determine the global minimum of @xmath236 in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "we then plot contours of constant @xmath246 corresponding to the 68% , 90% and 95% confidence levels .",
    "the second difference with respect to our first scanning method is that these contours refer to a constant @xmath236 , whereas in the first method the @xmath236 is different for each of the theory models considered .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure  [ fig : chi2babar ] .",
    "the best fit has an excellent @xmath247 ( for 3 degrees of freedom ) , corresponding to a confidence level of 54% .",
    "the parameters of the particular theory model corresponding to this fit are all very reasonable .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath225 parameterizing the weak annihilation terms is even smaller in magnitude than our default value .",
    "hence , a good global fit to the data can be obtained without using extreme choices of input parameters , or invoking phenomenological recipes such as largely enhanced annihilation or charm - penguin contributions .",
    "the default parameter set in table  [ tab : inputs ] also yields a good fit , which has @xmath248 and 21% confidence level .",
    "note that at 90% confidence level the allowed range obtained by combining our results with the measurement of @xmath209 in semileptonic @xmath0 decays excludes @xmath249 , thus establishing the existence of a cp - violating phase in @xmath250 transitions .",
    "the results of the two scanning methods shown in figures  [ fig : chi2fit ] and [ fig : chi2babar ] are similar ( though the range obtained in the first method is somewhat more conservative ) .",
    "the allowed region for @xmath44 and @xmath45 obtained from our analysis of rare hadronic @xmath0 decays is compatible with the standard global fit using information from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , @xmath229@xmath230 mixing and @xmath0@xmath48 mixing .",
    "however , the best fits to the rare - decay branching fractions prefer a larger value of @xmath2 ( of about @xmath251 ) .",
    "this has been noted by many other authors in the past , usually based on the naive factorization approximation and without a theoretical error estimate .",
    "here we have put this analysis on a firmer theoretical footing . on the other hand , we see that small values of @xmath2 are also allowed , provided the value of @xmath46 is lower than its standard central value . combining our results with the standard fit would reduce the allowed region in the @xmath4 plane by about a factor 2 , indicating that even with present experimental ( and theoretical ) errors the information obtained from rare hadronic decays provides important constraints on the wolfenstein parameters .",
    "it will be interesting to follow how the comparison of the standard fit and the fit to rare hadronic @xmath0 decays will develop as the data become more precise .",
    "if the two fits remain consistent with each other even as the allowed regions shrink in size , this would constitute a highly nontrivial test of the ckm model , in which for the first time the phase of the @xmath252 matrix element ( which enters through tree  penguin interference ) is restricted by both direct and indirect measurements .",
    "if , on the other hand , the two regions would not overlap at a reasonable confidence level , this may suggest that the standard theory of weak interactions does not account completely for either the @xmath0@xmath48 mixing amplitude ( since this is what determines the left - most side of the allowed region in the standard fit ) or the loop - induced flavour - changing amplitudes in @xmath1 decays .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath269 , for example , is @xmath282 the equivalent expression given in eq .",
    "( 23 ) of the third paper in @xcite reads @xmath283 using asymptotic twist-3 distribution amplitudes , one may check that @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "the two results then agree up to a constant @xmath286 .",
    "this difference can be traced back to an inconsistent use of twist-3 projectors in four space - time dimensions within a @xmath287-dimensional loop calculation , before the subtraction of ultraviolet poles is performed ( see the last reference in @xcite ) .",

    "a few minor discrepancies with our results occur in the expressions for the coefficients @xmath289 .",
    "the penguin contraction of the operators @xmath290 is treated incorrectly , as discussed in section  [ subsec : comments ] .",
    "photonic penguin contractions of the operators @xmath291 contributing to @xmath292 are omitted .",
    "also , qcd corrections to @xmath293 are not considered , presumably because the corresponding amplitudes are formally power suppressed .",
    "similarly to the results of @xcite , the twist-3 kernel for the hard spectator interaction contains an additional factor of @xmath280",
    ". finally , we briefly comment on the analysis of weak annihilation contributions . in @xcite the final state",
    "consists of a vector meson and a kaon rather than two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the decay amplitudes are estimated in the approximation of using leading - twist distribution amplitudes for the @xmath18 meson , but including chirally - enhanced twist-3 contributions for the kaon . taking this systematic difference into account",
    ", we can still compare the results of @xcite with our expressions .",
    "the two agree in the case of @xmath294 operators , but the results for @xmath295 operators are different .",
    "the latter are the ones that depend on the twist-3 contributions , but we do not have sufficient information to trace back the origin of the discrepancy .      recently , keum , li and sanda have presented an extensive study of @xmath31 decays within a perturbative hard - scattering ( or `` pqcd '' ) approach @xcite . while the underlying goal of a separation of soft and hard physics in the @xmath0-decay matrix elements is similar in spirit to qcd factorization , there are fundamental differences in the implementation of this idea .    in the pqcd approach ,",
    "the @xmath261 and @xmath296 form factors are assumed to be perturbatively calculable .",
    "this assumption is justified by invoking sudakov effects to regulate the infrared - sensitive contribution from the endpoint region in the integral over the light - cone momentum of the outgoing spectator quark . in other words ,",
    "the contribution from the region where the spectator quark is soft is supposed to be strongly suppressed , and therefore the exchange of a hard gluon is always required .",
    "instead of being of leading order ( in the qcd coupling constant ) , as in the generic case of a @xmath261 form factor dominated by soft physics , the form factor is now counted as being of order @xmath33 in perturbation theory .",
    "thus , the hierarchy of the various contributions to the decay amplitudes in pqcd is very different from that in our approach :    * in the pqcd approach , the @xmath31 matrix element is a quantity of order @xmath33 .",
    "to this order , therefore , all the wilson coefficients can then be taken in the leading logarithmic approximation . * the `` nonfactorizable '' hard gluon - exchange contributions to the kernels @xmath297 in ( [ fact ] )",
    "enter at order @xmath298 and are therefore omitted .",
    "note , however , that it is essential to consider such effects in order to establish factorization .",
    "this has never been done explicitly in the pqcd framework . *",
    "the form - factor terms containing the kernels @xmath299 and the hard - scattering terms containing the kernels @xmath164 in the factorization formula are treated as being of the same order in the pqcd approach .",
    "the former are called `` factorizable '' and the latter `` nonfactorizable '' . because both terms vanish simultaneously in the limit @xmath300 , naive factorization is not recovered in any limit of qcd .",
    "this is in contrast to our interpretation of the qcd factorization formula , for which naive factorization is recovered in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "after this brief synopsis of the key features of the pqcd scheme , we now examine critically the main assumptions of this approach in the context of @xmath31 decays .      in the pqcd approach the transverse momenta of the quarks",
    "are kept explicitly when evaluating contributions that are potentially infrared sensitive .",
    "for instance , the gluon - exchange kernel for the @xmath261 form factor is written as @xmath301 }     + \\ldots \\,,\\ ] ] where the ellipses represent less singular terms . here",
    "@xmath302 ( @xmath303 ) is the light - cone momentum fraction of the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson ( pion ) . in the conventional collinear expansion adopted in our work ,",
    "the transverse momenta @xmath304 would be treated as higher - twist effects and dropped ( more precisely , the amplitude would be expanded in powers of transverse momenta ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath305 , and so the convolution with the leading - twist pion distribution amplitude @xmath306 would lead to an integral @xmath307 , which is infrared divergent .",
    "this well - known result can be interpreted as a sign of the dominance of soft endpoint contributions in the @xmath261 form factor @xcite .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) this divergence is regulated by keeping the transverse momenta .",
    "then a fourier transform from transverse momentum space into impact parameter space ( @xmath255 space ) is performed , and a sudakov factor is included for each of the meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "this factor strongly suppresses the region of large @xmath255 , and the @xmath261 form factor is therefore assumed to be perturbatively calculable .",
    "it should be noted that retaining the transverse momentum dependence in @xmath308 , which is only part of the complete higher - twist contribution , is a model - dependent procedure .",
    "it is precisely in the critical endpoint region @xmath309 that the leading two - particle fock - state description that underlies this analysis breaks down .",
    "a further puzzle to us is the assumption made in @xcite that the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson has a large momentum component in the `` @xmath310 '' direction , @xmath311 , when the pion momentum is in the `` @xmath312 '' direction .",
    "this is used to derive the sudakov factor for the @xmath0 meson in analogy to the case of a fast light meson .",
    "since the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson is intrinsically soft , we see no justification for such an assumption .    in conclusion , we believe that the perturbative evaluation of the @xmath261 form factor , which is one of the central ingredients of the pqcd analysis in @xcite , is not justified .",
    "the relevance of sudakov form factors in hadronic @xmath0 decays should be investigated in a more systematic way .",
    "however , it seems unlikely to us that sudakov logarithms are sufficiently important at the scale @xmath313 to eliminate the soft contributions to heavy - to - light form factors and thus render them calculable in a model - independent way .",
    "a complete description of the @xmath261 transitions at large recoil in the heavy - quark limit and the derivation of a ( hypothetical ) factorization theorem for these processes has , to our knowledge , never been presented . for recent progress in this direction and further critical discussions of the problem",
    "see @xcite .",
    "keum et al .",
    "claim a dynamical enhancement of ( factorizable ) contributions to the matrix elements of penguin operators ( such as @xmath314 and @xmath315 ) in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "the first reason given in support of this assertion is a dynamical enhancement of the @xmath261 form factor of the scalar density @xmath316 contained in ( the fierz - transformed form of ) @xmath315 , relative to the form factor of the vector current @xmath317 relevant for other operators .",
    "a dynamically different structure for the form factor of the scalar density in pqcd is claimed , and a strong sensitivity of the effect to the model employed for the @xmath0-meson light - cone distribution amplitude is noted . however , an enhancement of this nature is not possible , because the form factor of the scalar density is related to that of the vector current by the equations of motion , leading to @xmath318 the erroneous conclusion in @xcite is the consequence of an incorrect treatment of the twist-3 contribution to the pion distribution amplitude ( see below ) .",
    "the second reason given in favor of a penguin enhancement is the choice of a low scale @xmath221 in the ( leading - order ) penguin coefficients @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "this is motivated by arguing that @xmath221 should be a typical scale intrinsic to the dynamics of the @xmath261 form factor in the pqcd evaluation .",
    "however , the scale @xmath221 is unphysical and must be canceled by vertex corrections to the operator matrix elements , and in the case of @xmath320 also by the running quark masses .",
    "such corrections have been properly included in the present work , but they were neglected in @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath221 in @xmath321 may depend on the scale of non - factorizable hard spectator interactions , but it is clearly independent of the internal dynamics of the form factor .",
    "the arguments made in favour of a low scale @xmath221 and correspondingly increased penguin coefficients are therefore not well justified .      in their analysis ,",
    "keum et al .",
    "find that penguin annihilation contributions are numerically very important and give a dominant contribution to some of the @xmath31 decay amplitudes .",
    "we have investigated these effects in the present work and found them to give a significant correction ( compatible with being a power correction of canonical size ) , but not a dominant contribution . nevertheless , it must be emphasized that weak - annihilation diagrams contribute at subleading power in the heavy - quark expansion and , in general , are not calculable in a qcd - based factorization approach .",
    "therefore , the question about the relevance of these effects warrants further investigation .      it is claimed that large strong - interaction phases are generated by hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark in the @xmath0 meson , as well as by weak annihilation diagrams .",
    "let us consider the hard spectator interactions in detail . in that case",
    "the effect is calculable within the qcd factorization approach and found to be real to leading order .",
    "the source of the imaginary part found in @xcite is as follows .",
    "the quark propagator entering the hard - scattering diagram is written as @xmath322 working to leading power we would drop the transverse components and find a real contribution to the kernel .",
    "keum et al . , on the other hand , keep the transverse momenta and hence generate an imaginary part proportional to @xmath323 , where @xmath324 .",
    "again , this treatment is model dependent .",
    "the fourier transform of the kernel into impact parameter space results in a bessel function with the imaginary part proportional to @xmath325 . in the evaluation of the matrix element",
    "this function is convoluted with the sudakov factor .",
    "since the bessel function is oscillating rapidly , with the amplitude of @xmath326 growing like @xmath327 , the result of this convolution is very sensitive to the details of the @xmath255-space cut - off .",
    "this implies that the estimate of the strong - interaction phase is both model dependent and numerically sensitive to effects that are poorly under control .",
    "similar comments hold for the estimate of the strong - interaction phases from the annihilation contributions , which are generated in an analogous way .",
    "finally , we remark that the simple @xmath328 structure of the twist-3 projection for the pion employed by keum et al .",
    "is incomplete .",
    "the proper treatment is discussed in section  [ subsec : comments ] .",
    "the wrong twist-3 projection is , in particular , inconsistent with gauge invariance .",
    "moreover , the correct asymptotic behaviour of the twist-3 pion distribution amplitude @xmath329 is proportional to a constant , whereas the functional form @xmath330 is assumed in @xcite .",
    "this problem affects all decay amplitudes , including the @xmath261 form factor , the corresponding spurious penguin enhancement , and the nonfactorizable spectator interactions and annihilation contributions .",
    "other analyses in the spirit of the pqcd approach were presented in @xcite , to which similar comments apply . in @xcite ,",
    "the presence of a `` recoil - phase '' effect was advocated , which was claimed to originate within the pqcd framework .",
    "this phase should affect , e.g. , the @xmath261 form factor , which was assumed to be dominated by hard gluon exchange .",
    "it was argued that , when the gluon is exchanged between the spectator quark and the @xmath255 quark , the @xmath255-quark propagator could go on the mass shell because @xmath331 .",
    "this in turn would lead to a complex phase in the form factor . in our opinion",
    "this conclusion is unwarranted , since bound - state effects have to be factorized before a perturbative treatment can be justified and thus can not influence the hard - scattering process .",
    "another fundamental objection to the `` recoil phase '' is that it would contradict the fact that the @xmath261 form factor is a real quantity .",
    "recently , khodjamirian has suggested to study hadronic matrix elements for two - body @xmath0 decays in the framework of light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "as an example , he discusses the matrix elements of the current  current operators @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath53 decays . the idea is to generalize the light - cone qcd sum - rule analysis of the @xmath261 form factor directly to the case of hadronic two - body modes . the starting point is the correlation function @xmath332|\\pi^-(q )     \\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath333 and @xmath334 are interpolating currents for the emission pion and the @xmath0 meson , respectively .",
    "the explicit pion state @xmath335 represents the recoil pion that absorbs the spectator quark . according to the qcd sum rule philosophy ,",
    "the correlator is evaluated in two ways : by a direct calculation in qcd , and by inserting complete sets of hadronic states between the operator @xmath336 and the interpolating currents , extracting the desired ground - state contribution with the help of quark  hadron duality .",
    "the two sides of the equation are expressed in the form of dispersion relations , and the usual borel transformation is applied . to leading order in @xmath33 , the factorized result for the matrix element",
    "is recovered . a particular type of power correction",
    "is then estimated as a further illustration .",
    "this contribution comes from higher twist , three - particle ( quark  antiquark  gluon ) fock components of the recoil pion , where the ( nonfactorizable ) gluon couples to the quark lines of the emission current . in the heavy - quark limit the resulting expression",
    "is demonstrated to scale as @xmath34 relative to the leading contribution .",
    "it is estimated to be of relative size @xmath337 with @xmath3380.15gev .",
    "note that this correction has no rescattering phase .",
    "its numerical effect is small , but comparable to the perturbative corrections at leading power .",
    "additional nonfactorizable contributions exist but have not yet been investigated .",
    "examples are the gluon - exchange effects that correspond to the vertex corrections and the spectator scattering diagrams in the qcd factorization formula . in the sum - rule approach",
    "these effects are in principle contained in similar diagrams , together with certain hadronic corrections of subleading power .",
    "a potential difficulty will be to disentangle power corrections to the asymptotic result given by the qcd factorization formula from uncertainties intrinsic to the sum rule method , such as the assumption of quark  hadron duality and the approximation of the emission pion by an interpolating current .",
    "it is not fully clear how this can be achieved in a controlled and systematic fashion .",
    "some recent papers @xcite have tried to model soft final - state interactions via the rescattering of certain hadronic channels such as @xmath339 .",
    "we consider such an approach to be problematical for a variety of reasons .",
    "there are many more intermediate channels beyond those taken into account .",
    "systematic cancellations among these channels , which are predicted to occur in the heavy - quark limit , are missed when only a few intermediate states are retained ( see the discussion in sections  3.4 and 7.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the hadronic dynamics of multi - body decays is very complicated and in general not under theoretical control .",
    "the main problem of such models is the lack of a systematic approximation scheme based on parametric expansions . in our opinion ,",
    "the use of a purely hadronic language , suitable for kaon decays , is not very helpful in the case of @xmath0 decays , where the number of channels and the energy release are large .    in @xcite ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 obtained from the qcd factorization approach have been used in conjunction with a hadronic description of final - state interactions .",
    "the general caveats concerning hadronic rescattering models apply also here .",
    "moreover , such an approach faces a manifest double - counting problem , since rescattering effects in the heavy - quark limit are already contained in the qcd coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "a nonperturbative treatment of `` charming penguins '' , matrix elements with charm loops of the type shown in figure  [ fig : penguin ] , was proposed in @xcite . in this calculation",
    "operators with flavour structure @xmath340 were split into nonlocal products of currents @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "these were connected by intermediate virtual @xmath343-meson states to yield transitions such as @xmath344 under the separate action of the currents .",
    "however , the operators @xmath340 are local operators in the effective theory at the @xmath255-mass scale",
    ". they would become nonlocal only if probed at the far higher scale of @xmath345 , but certainly not at a scale of order @xmath346 , as implied in @xcite .",
    "we therefore see no basis for the method adopted in this paper .",
    "there are several recent analyses in the literature that approach hadronic @xmath0 decays in a more phenomenological way .",
    "some of the most extensive studies of this type have been presented by ali et al .",
    "@xcite , who elaborate on the concept of `` generalized factorization '' @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "part of the order-@xmath33 vertex and penguin contributions calculated in the present work are included . as a consequence ,",
    "the decay amplitudes receive strong - interaction phases due to the bander  silverman ",
    "soni mechanism @xcite , and nonzero cp asymmetries are obtained . however , no systematic attempt to include all such effects ( or to prove factorization ) is made . also , these authors rely on ad hoc model assumptions such as an `` effective number of colours '' @xmath347 , which is introduced to parameterize nonfactorizable corrections .",
    "a recent study of @xmath31 decays presented in @xcite emphasizes general , model - independent parameterizations of the decay amplitudes such as our parameterization in ( [ para ] ) , avoiding as much as possible the use of dynamical input .",
    "for instance , strong - interaction phases are a priori allowed to take any value in the construction of bounds on ckm parameters .",
    "information on these phases may then be inferred indirectly .",
    "such an approach is complementary to the more ambitious goal of exploiting theoretical insight into the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "in fact , the smallness of the rescattering effects parameterized by @xmath348 in ( [ para ] ) , which is a prediction of the qcd factorization approach , represents a useful input to such a phenomenological analysis .",
    "many other phenomenological studies of two - body hadronic @xmath0 decays have been performed in the literature .",
    "recent examples are @xcite , where simplifying assumptions are made and no systematic estimates of theoretical uncertainties are undertaken .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed study of @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays based on the qcd factorization formula .",
    "this approach allows us to perform a systematic and model - independent calculation of two - body hadronic @xmath0 decays in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "we have evaluated the hard - scattering kernels entering the matrix elements for @xmath31 , @xmath219 decays at next - to - leading order in @xmath33 , thus obtaining predictions for the decay amplitudes including the leading , `` nonfactorizable '' corrections .",
    "we have included the contributions from electroweak penguins , taking into account the corresponding order-@xmath33 corrections to the dominant terms ( enhanced by @xmath349 or @xmath168 ) in a consistent approximation scheme .",
    "all hard - scattering kernels have been derived for general , asymmetric distribution amplitudes , as appropriate for @xmath229 mesons .",
    "in addition to computing the model - independent leading - twist results , we have identified and estimated those power corrections which are expected to be the largest . we have analyzed the complete set of contributions from light - cone wave functions of twist 3 with a chiral enhancement factor @xmath350 or @xmath351 , as well as the contributions from weak annihilation topologies , including both twist-2 and twist-3 components in the light - meson wave functions .",
    "we distinguish three classes of power corrections : the contributions from operators with ( pseudo- ) scalar currents ( @xmath352 ) , twist-3 effects in the hard spectator interactions , and weak annihilation corrections . while the first two effects are proportional to the chiral enhancement factor , the annihilation terms are quadratic polynomials in this factor .",
    "since these are power - suppressed effects , we do not expect the factorization formula to work in these cases .",
    "in fact , naively evaluating these terms in a `` hard - scattering '' framework one encounters logarithmic endpoint singularities .",
    "( incidentally , the terms of order @xmath33 related to @xmath293 are free of such infrared singularities , but divergent terms are present for the other two contributions . ) therefore , while our results at leading twist are model - independent predictions of qcd in the heavy - quark limit , some model dependence is currently unavoidable in the description of power corrections .",
    "we choose to regulate these divergences by introducing a simple cutoff , leading to the complex phenomenological parameters @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the motivation for this model - dependent approach to power corrections is twofold : we obtain systematic order - of - magnitude estimates , while automatically keeping track of relative suppressions or enhancements from wilson coefficients and ckm factors .",
    "in addition , we can investigate the sensitivity of the observables on the model parameters .",
    "it turns out that annihilation graphs may in principle give sizable corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "twist-3 effects in the hard spectator contributions appear generally to be less prominent .    using this framework ,",
    "we have performed a detailed comparison with the available experimental data on @xmath31 and @xmath32 branching ratios .",
    "the data are beginning to be sufficiently precise to allow for detailed phenomenological analyses .",
    "an important result is that in the qcd factorization approach the @xmath31 branching fractions can be larger than the @xmath32 ones without any tuning of the theoretical input parameters , and without invoking large phenomenological power corrections .",
    "an acceptable fit to the branching fractions is obtained even if we impose that @xmath353 as implied by the standard constraints on the unitarity triangle .",
    "this is in contrast to the naive factorization model , in which the observed branching fractions can either not be reproduced at all or require a large ckm angle @xmath2 , in conflict with other indirect determinations . encouraged by this success ,",
    "we have derived constraints in the @xmath4 plane from a global fit to the @xmath31 , @xmath219 branching ratios , which already provide useful additional information on the unitarity triangle . clearly , the experimental situation will continue to improve and allow us to further test our framework and exploit it in phenomenological studies of hadronic @xmath0 decays . an important role in these analyses",
    "will be played by the tree - to - penguin ratio @xmath128 , which can be reliably determined from @xmath17 and @xmath354 decays and can be unambiguously confronted with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this will be a valuable check that the power corrections are not surprisingly large .",
    "the absence of penguin and annihilation contributions in the @xmath17 mode is a crucial feature in this analysis",
    ". a more precise measurement of this decay will thus be particularly useful .",
    "we would like to conclude by emphasizing again the strategy underlying our treatment of weak annihilation contributions and non - leading , but chirally - enhanced spectator interactions .",
    "while the present data do not require these effects to be larger than expected , the data also do not definitively exclude this possibility .",
    "our error analysis is based on allowing the parameters @xmath355 and @xmath356 to be smaller than 1 ( reflecting the range of our expectations ) , but the error estimates sometimes depend sensitively on the precise choice of this upper limit , in particular in the case of @xmath355 . with more precise data one may contemplate fitting @xmath355 to data ( in practice this implies fitting the qcd penguin amplitude ) in order to decide upon the plausibility of the adopted range of values .",
    "the discovery of large annihilation contributions would by itself constitute valuable insight into the strong - interaction dynamics of nonleptonic decays , but would evidently limit the utility of the qcd factorization approach .",
    "the present data make this scenario appear unlikely , but we look forward to further information to validate our error estimation . in this case , important and reliable information on flavour physics will become available from @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays , as well as from a large class of other two - body hadronic decays into light pseudoscalar and vector mesons .    _",
