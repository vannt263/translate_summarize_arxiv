    "string / m - theory @xcite is still a perspective candidate for the unified theory of all physical interactions , but a problem of its experimental verification remains unsolved .",
    "however , the generic formulation of a string theory is not completed and in some cases it is appropriate to consider the low energy approximation .",
    "the second order expansion is the gauss - bonnet one . in the framework of einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity",
    "a set of interesting solutions has been obtained , especially black hole ones @xcite .",
    "one can use the results of their physical effects to test the string theory and to search for the new physics in gravitation . in the present study we are looking for such effects in the solution obtained in the maeda and dadhich ( md ) papers @xcite-@xcite devoted to egb gravity with a cosmological constant .",
    "of course , basic properties of the md solutions were analyzed carefully by maeda and dadhich @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , properties which could be useful for experimental / observational physics were not considered completely .",
    "thus , it is possible to study physically sensible properties and characteristics , which could be observable .",
    "the main assumption for the md solutions is the kaluza - klein type splitting of the egb space - time .",
    "so , there is a physical ( dynamic ) space - time ( of 2 , 3 or 4 dimensions ) and a space of auxiliary dimensions .",
    "the later one has a constant curvature with the negative sign , whereas in the standard kaluza - klein model a space - time of auxiliary dimensions is flat .",
    "we concentrate on the 4-dimensional ( 4d ) static schwarzschild - like solution because it seems to be more promising in searching for physically sensible effects . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the minimal case of 6d egb space - time that has been studied separately by molina and dadhich @xcite and we denote as dm .",
    "the egb solution properties in 6d are similar to those in arbitrary egb dimensions with @xmath0 .",
    "we check the dm solutions from two points of view .",
    "to be physically sensible these solutions have to have , first , acceptable theoretical description , and , second , observable evidences , at least , principally .",
    "theoretical description has to give a non - contradictive definitions of important characteristics .",
    "undoubtedly , for solutions , which pretend to present astrophysical gravitating objects , such a characteristic is a total mass ( energy ) of the system .",
    "a separate section is devoted to this problem , where we use a well developed superpotential technique .",
    "not less important theoretical property is a stability of the solution .",
    "we notice that a stability is directly connected with a well defined total mass , and independently we state a possibility that the dm solutions to leave stable .",
    "thus , chances to detect related astrophysical objects arise .    properties , which could be potentially observable and which we study are orbital and thermodynamic effects related to the dm solutions .",
    "the last part of the paper is just devoted to these problems .",
    "as known , thermodynamic properties are directly connected with a horizon structure of solutions . as it turns out , geometrical structure of the dm solutions is quite non - trivial and we examine it in a significantly more detail than it is given in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ dmmodel ] , we briefly recall the md idea of constructing solutions of specific type in the egb gravity , present the dm solution and its main features . in section [ thetotalmass ] ,",
    "we discuss the problems of the total energy in the dm models and present the total mass calculation . in section [ stability ]",
    "we study the stability of the dm solutions . in section [ metric ]",
    "we discuss geometrical structure of the dm solution in the form of black hole - like objects with one / two horizons or naked singularities . in section [ orbits ] , we establish a possibility of stable orbits and corresponding effects . in section [ thermodynamics ] , we calculate thermodynamical properties .",
    "section [ discussionconclusions ] contains a discussion of dm solution role and corresponding conclusions . in appendix",
    "we present differential operators for section [ stability ] .",
    "the restriction of the egb gravity in 6d in the dm solution @xcite leads to the following form of action : @xmath1 here and below we use @xmath2 units , @xmath3 is the 6-dimensional gravitational ( einstein ) constant , @xmath4 is the gauss - bonnet coupling constant ; @xmath5 is a 6-dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the cosmological constant and @xmath7 is the gauss - bonnet term : @xmath8 varying the action with respect to metric , one obtains egb gravitational equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the einstein tensor : @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the tensor corresponding to the gauss - bonnet term @xmath7 in the action .",
    "the main md assumptions are as follows :    * the space - time of egb gravity ( 6d in our case ) is homeomorphical to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a 4-dimensional physical space - time and @xmath15 is a space of constant curvature with radius @xmath16 and sign @xmath17 ( they are not determined now ) .",
    "it is just the kaluza - klein type splitting .",
    "* egb vacuum case @xmath18 is considered .    under such assumptions",
    "the gravitational equations are automatically decomposed into the system : @xmath19\\overset{(4)}{g}{}^a_{~b}+ \\alpha \\overset{(4)}{h}{}^a_{~b}+\\left[\\lambda-\\cfrac{\\bar k}{r_0 ^ 2}\\right ] \\overset{(4)}{\\delta}{}^a_{~b}=0 ~ , \\label{i_4d_grav_eq } \\\\ \\delta^a_{~~b}\\left[-\\frac12\\overset{(4)}{r}+\\lambda -\\cfrac{\\alpha}{2 } \\overset{(4)}l_{gb}\\right]=0 ~,\\label{maineq_pre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 and index `` @xmath22 '' denotes four - dimensional quantities . because the tensor @xmath23 vanishes in 4d space - time equations",
    "acquire the form of the vacuum einstein equations with a modified cosmological constant , while equation plays a role of a constraint for the main equations only .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite  -  @xcite claim that the system of - has no black hole - like solutions .",
    "furthermore they suggested that the coefficients in square brackets in be put equal to zero .",
    "it turns out that in the case when the egb - dm parameters are restricted by the equalities @xmath24 instead of and one can consider only the scalar constraint that can be rewritten in a simplier form : @xmath25 the equation has a set of interesting solutions . among them",
    "there is the dm one , that we consider in this paper .",
    "it can be represented as @xmath26 ~,\\label{f_pm_si_unit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 appear to be the main solution parameters .",
    "historically , @xmath27 is treated as a mass of a black hole and @xmath28 is an additional charge .",
    "energy connected characteristics play crucial role in a description of potentially observable physical objects .",
    "so , first of all , we have to define and calculate total mass ( energy ) of the solution - .",
    "other conserved characteristic are zero by symmetries of the solution .",
    "one finds that the 4-dimensional metric - at @xmath29 behaves as : @xmath30 asymptotically the solution - tends to ads metric @xmath31 here and below `` bar '' denotes a background quantity .",
    "so , in and the effective curvature radius of anti - de sitter ( ads ) , @xmath32 , effective mass parameter , @xmath33 , and effective charge parameter @xmath34 , are defined , respectively , as @xmath35    so , the dm solution - behaving as ( [ 1 ] ) can be considered as a perturbed metric respectively ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "such a presentation allows using the superpotential technique for a total mass calculation .",
    "the asymptotic metric is chosen as a background space - time .",
    "it could be written in two ways : both in 4 physical dimensions and in full 6 egb gravity dimensions .",
    "thus , the background metric could be chosen in the form ( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath36 , or ( [ 2 ] ) together with the metric of @xmath15 space - time , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "such a background provides the following time - like killing vector : @xmath39 necessary for defining the energy ; @xmath40 includes all the space - time dimensions .",
    "various forms of superpotentials in @xmath41 dimensions , @xmath42 , applicable in ads and ads - like backgrounds , have been constructed both in general relativity ( gr ) and in egb theory , see , for example , @xcite-@xcite and references there in . for future work",
    "it is useful to rewrite them in an united form via anti - symmetric tensors @xmath43 as @xmath44 here and below @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determinants of @xmath47-dimensional dynamical and background metrics respectively , @xmath48 is the gravitational constant in @xmath47-dimensional space - time . using a time - like killing vector ,",
    "one calculates a total mass in an d - dimensional space - time : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is @xmath51-dimensional boundary of a @xmath52-dimensional space - like hyper - surface @xmath53 defined as @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the integration element on @xmath50 .",
    "the discussed metric with the asymptote ( [ 1 ] ) looks very similar to the reisner - nordstrm - ads solution : @xmath56 then it seems total mass of the solution - could be calculated by the standard methods like the mass in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "however , the solution ( [ 5 ] ) is a solution of gr equations , whereas - resolves the egb ones .",
    "moreover , they degenerate into the simplest scalar form . thus , for applying the usual gr methods it is important to present a more serious foundation and we provide it below .",
    "it is better to apply the generic formula ( [ 4 ] ) to the egb model - using killing vector ( [ 3 ] ) from the very beginning .",
    "so , we take a belinfante corrected superpotential constructed in @xcite as : @xmath57 other superpotentials in @xcite-@xcite lead to the same result but through a longer path .",

    "it is important to notice that the gr part , @xmath63 in ( [ 7 ] ) , being constructed in arbitrary @xmath47 dimensions , has the form of belinfante corrected superpotential for gr @xcite . in minkowski background with cartesian coordinates and translation killing vectors",
    "@xmath63 transforms into the well - known papapetrou superpotential @xcite .",
    "now we turn to eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "taking into account the md restrictions in egb gravity from the section [ dmmodel ] , one immediately concludes that @xmath64 ( when @xmath65 ) depends upon physical metric @xmath66 and its derivatives only in the physical sector . besides , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "further , because of a spherical symmetry in the metric discussed one needs a @xmath70-component of the superpotential , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ 4 ] ) could be rewritten in the form : @xmath74    returning to kaluza - klein idea from md papers , one treats the additional dimensions as compact ones .",
    "thus , a volume @xmath75 is finite , and eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) is established as @xmath76 here , according to the kaluza - klein prescription , @xmath77 is the gravitational constant of a 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "so , one can conclude that eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) represents the result of a gravitational interaction in a 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "however , then one points out that the eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) is incomplete because a superpotential @xmath78 has to be exchanged by @xmath79 constructed in 4 dimensions .",
    "but , a 4d metric theory , in the framework of which @xmath79 could be constructed , is not determined at the moment , although from the theoretical point of view gr one is more preferable .",
    "moreover , it turns out that gr is preferable for applications .",
    "we test the solution - on astronomical and cosmological scales where gr explains the experimental data correctly .",
    "thus , gr is better to choose @xmath79 constructed in the framework of gr .",
    "so , we use the gr part ( [ 7 ] ) of ( [ 6 ] ) changing @xmath80 . finally , instead of ( [ 11 ] ) one has to use @xmath81    the gr equations corresponding to ( [ 12 ] ) with the solution - can be derived as @xmath82 here @xmath83 . of course ,",
    "a trace of eq .",
    "( ) must be compatible with the main equation .",
    "such a model based of the equations ( [ 13 ] ) can not be described in the framework of the standard gr .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath84 is determined as usual , whereas the energy - momentum tensor @xmath85 of induced matter is generally unknown .",
    "only one solution of the eq . determines a particular form of @xmath85 after the substitution of - into the left hand side of ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we treat the theory based on the equations ( [ 13 ] ) as an `` effective '' version of gr .",
    "nevertheless , such a derivation is enough to define a superpotential @xmath86 without ambiguities because for construction @xmath86 one needs a pure gravitational presentation without matter part .",
    "so , we use ( [ 12 ] ) to calculate total mass of the system ( object ) presented by the solution - . taking into account the asymptotic behavior ( [ 1 ] ) and the background metric ( [ 2 ] ) one obtains @xmath87 a system is physically sensible",
    "if its total energy is not negative @xmath88 , therefore one must set @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , the charge parameter @xmath28 does not contribute into @xmath90 , so we have an analogy with the reisner - nordsrm - ads black hole ( [ 5 ] ) , where @xmath91 , and @xmath92 does not contribute into @xmath90 .    finally , a move from ( [ 9 ] ) to ( [ 14 ] ) supports the md assertion @xcite-@xcite , so the matter is induced by additional dimensions . starting from the vacuum system and",
    "we derive formula ( [ 9 ] ) , which is defined for the vacuum egb model and step by step we obtain ( [ 14 ] ) with the correctly defined total mass of the system .",
    "unambiguously , the mass defined by the parameter @xmath27 is a characteristic of matter created by compactified additional dimensions .",
    "the charge parameter @xmath28 also describes the induced matter .",
    "this can be proved by changing the limit in ( [ 12 ] ) from @xmath29 to @xmath93 .",
    "so a mass inside a sphere with the radius @xmath94 is determined both by the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "although @xmath28 does not contribute into the total mass like @xmath92 in electrodynamics .",
    "concluding the section , we return to ( [ 9 ] ) again .",
    "let us assume that we suppress a desire to transfer to a metric theory in 4-dimensional space - time like ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "in other words , lets restrict ourselves to a consideration of 6d egb theory only . then , in ( [ 9 ] ) , one must use the complete superpotential ( [ 6 ] ) - ( [ 8 ] ) . after direct and cumbersome calculations",
    "one finds @xmath95 for the solution - .",
    "this result coincides with the conclusions of @xcite , where the solution - represents a particular case of a lovelock gravity .",
    "the problem of dm solution stability is important from a theoretical point of view and is crucial in cosmological and astrophysics applications .",
    "usually , for such test one perturbs metric coefficients and checks their further behavior .",
    "technically this is carried out by perturbing initial field equations and solving them .",
    "however , to obtain the dm solution special restrictions and conditions have been used .",
    "therefore , a study of the perturbation problem can not be provided in the standard steps and requires a more attention .",
    "a first fundamental question that arises is as follows .",
    "have we to consider a stability of the dm solution in the 6-dimensional egb spacetime or in the 4-dimensional physical spacetime ?",
    "let s consider the system , together with .",
    "following the the paper by cai with coauthors @xcite one finds that vanishing coefficients in the vacuum einstein equations correspond to an infinite gravitational constant .",
    "so , a model presented by all the equations and , of course , with in 6 dimensions is fundamentally stable .",
    "then , because have to be left unchanged one has a possibility to consider perturbations of the unique equation in 4-dimensional spacetime only . beside of that , there is another argument for considering the conditions as unperturbed .",
    "assume that one disturbs all the equations in 6 dimensions of egb spacetime and recall that the dm solution exists _ only _ , when the conditions are fulfilled",
    ". then , destructing conditions even by extremely small perturbations , or even by time independent perturbations , one finds immediately that the dm solution does not exist at all .",
    "thus , perturbations of a general kind in 6 dimensions make the stability problem of the dm solution senseless itself .",
    "another problem in studying the stability of the dm solution appears because one has a possibility to analyze the _ unique _ equation , whereas in a general case one has to study 10 perturbed metric functions .",
    "one could try to use the 10 equations .",
    "however , in this case , it is impossible to apply the standard methods because a general form of is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of the `` effective '' gr with the equations could be useful .",
    "so , abbott and deser in @xcite proved the stability of an asymptotically ads system in the framework of gr .",
    "they based on the statement that total energy of the system is positive for asymptotically ads space - time .",
    "in fact , if we are sure of the validity of the kaluza - klein mechanism of matter creation and the positive total mass ( energy ) ( [ 14 ] ) , the abbott - deser arguments are sufficient to state that the dm solution is also stable .    in spite of the above conclusion is quite concrete , it was obtained by a not direct way .",
    "therefore it is interesting and important to consider the problem being restricted only to the unique equation .",
    "it is important that we can not solve the perturbation problem completely and classically . analyzing we work within the linear metric perturbations .",
    "then , each of the perturbations within a linearized equation can be considered as separate .",
    "in such a presentation , we obtain several equations for each perturbation .",
    "so , we have no possibility to study the perturbation problem directly and fully .",
    "but it is possible to find a behavior of perturbations that does not destroy the dm solution ( among others , which could destroy it ) .",
    "if such a behaviour exists , we assert that a system might be stable . for our purposes",
    "this is enough , and we follow such strategy .",
    "it is constructive to consider two cases : when ( i ) axial symmetry is applied , ( ii ) there are no symmetries . the case ( i )",
    "means the existence of perturbations with axial symmetry , corresponding to black holes with small angular momentum .",
    "this case is quite important because the md model excludes rotating black holes as it is stated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "further , the instability of the dm metric with axial perturbations means that the solution must be destroyed by a rotation .",
    "such a conclusion could be fatal for cosmological and astrophysics applications where most of objects rotate .",
    "we turn to an axial case in general and use the expression in a generic form with a non - stationary axially symmetric metric suggested by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "it has the form : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath27 , @xmath98 , @xmath6 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 depend upon @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( usual spherical coordinates ) . for the dm solution that is treated as background",
    "metric these functions acquire the form : @xmath105 perturbing the functions - and introducing a perturbative parameter @xmath106 one gets : @xmath107 where functions @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath28 depending upon @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are treated as perturbations .",
    "recalling our assumption for a linear approximation we neglect the terms , quadratic in @xmath106 in , which appear after substituting - , and derive @xmath114 matrix in the form :    @xmath115    substituting into the main dm equation , leaving the linear in @xmath106 terms only and considering each perturbation separately one obtains the following system @xmath116 where the notation @xmath117 is used for each perturbation : @xmath118 , @xmath119 is a differential operator for @xmath117 perturbation .",
    "implies that we can consider an influence of the dm solutions of different kinds separately .",
    "a concrete form for the differential operators in is presented in appendix .",
    "of course , the representation of the unique equation for perturbations in the form of the system significantly simplifies the analysis . as a result",
    ", we lose various variants to find many of both stable and unstable possibilities for behaviour , which could follow from the unique equation .",
    "however , if we find a behaviour of the set of the functions @xmath117 that leaves the md solution stable then our task to find a possibility of a stability of the md solution is achieved .",
    "as @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are not differential operators , the equations for @xmath113 , @xmath28 and @xmath112 lead to vanishing of @xmath113 , @xmath28 and @xmath112 values .",
    "for all the other perturbations allow to apply the procedure of variables separation and pick out time , radial and angular parts for each one .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath102 dependency , because it is crucial for the stability study .    for @xmath109 perturbation",
    ", @xmath123 does not contain time derivatives , so , among other possibilities , we can consider @xmath109 perturbation as time independent only",
    ". for @xmath108 perturbation , a time dependent part of @xmath124 has a simple form and is satisfied by a _ time dependence _",
    "@xmath125 $ ] , where @xmath126 is a constant of variables separation .",
    "there are no restrictions on a complex number @xmath126 from a radial part equation . therefore to find the perturbation @xmath108 that vanishes exponentially in time one treats @xmath126 as a positive real number .",
    "operators @xmath127 and @xmath128 contain a more complicated wave - like operator @xmath129 . however , similarly for perturbations",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 operators a behavior @xmath125 $ ] with an arbitrary complex number @xmath126 is permitted also .",
    "therefore , in general , wave and wave - like solutions are possible .",
    "however , again one treats @xmath126 as a positive real number and finds that @xmath110 and @xmath111 vanish exponentially in time .",
    "thus , based on the result that perturbations can die away exponentially , we assert that the dm solution has a possibility to remain stable",
    ".    finally , let s discuss the case ( ii ) without space - time symmetries .",
    "firstly , one has to consider 10 perturbations , secondly , all of them depend upon the coordinates @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath130 .",
    "in general , the study looks very cumbersome . to simplify it",
    "we apply the idea of the `` effective '' gr . because of the general covariance of the einstein equations , there is a freedom in coordinate transformations at the level of perturbations . using this possibility we set 4 of 10 perturbations equal to zero from the very beginning . using the chandrasekhar frame we derive a perturbed metric matrix as    @xmath131    instead of .",
    "the study of in analogy to analyzing with leads to the same conclusion : perturbations can die away exponentially in time , and , thus , the dm solution has a possibility to conserve a stability .",
    "as the dm solution is stable , we analyze its geometrical structure up to @xmath132 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "hereafter we work within @xmath133 units .",
    "then @xmath134 defined in is rewritten as @xmath135   ~.\\ ] ] we call @xmath136 and @xmath137 positive and negative branches of the solution , respectively .",
    "first of all , there are some general restrictions on parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the requirement for a total mass ( energy ) of the system to be non - negative leads to the conclusion that for the @xmath136 branch the mass parameter @xmath27 is non - positive , whereas for the @xmath137 branch it is non - negative .",
    "the positive branch is not valid for black hole - like objects describing because @xmath136 do not vanish and , so , a horizon could not be defined .",
    "the negative branch can describe black holes because @xmath137 is allowed to acquire zero s values .",
    "both @xmath136 and @xmath137 could correspond to objects with naked singularities .",
    "we are interesting in potentially observable consequences .",
    "therefore , as eq .",
    "is valid for both branches , it can be applied to describe both black holes and naked singularities . to study the charge parameter @xmath28",
    ", we compare the asymptotic behavior with the rn - ads solution in electrodynamics . in the later case the coefficient before @xmath138 is positive , whereas in the case that we discuss in the paper coefficient before @xmath138 can also be negative .",
    "this means that the charge parameter @xmath28 can describe the additional gravitational potential with the asymptotes analogous to the electric charge in and a tidal charge of the dadhich - rezania solution @xcite .",
    "such an exotic charge describes a bulk influence on a brane . in the dm solution",
    "additional dimensions are a part of the construction , so , it is natural to expect a similar behavior for the charge @xmath28 .    for both branches the expression under square root must be non - negative .",
    "so , the range of definition of @xmath139 is restricted by inequality : @xmath140 we consider it as a limitation for @xmath28 parameter in both @xmath141 and @xmath142 cases .",
    "before studying structures of black hole - like objects with horizons and naked singularities we have to state few necessary relations arising from .",
    "we start from the negative branch with @xmath143 .",
    "let us rewrite in the form @xmath144    it is natural to require the existence @xmath137 everywhere in @xmath145 area both in black hole - like and naked singularity cases .",
    "the limitation leads to the following condition : @xmath146 .",
    "however , when the area inside the horizon @xmath147 is not defined , we can continue to treat an external area as a physical one .",
    "so , instead of we consider the relation : @xmath148 as a result , there are two possible cases : @xmath145 and . for the naked singularity case",
    "only the restriction @xmath146 is allowed .",
    "we turn to the positive branch where @xmath149 .",
    "it describes naked singularities . to do this",
    "we return to , considering the case @xmath145 and @xmath149 .",
    "this leads to a simple limitation : @xmath150 note that this is a restriction for @xmath28 in the region @xmath142 .",
    "we turn to the conditions , under which the discussed solution becomes a black hole .",
    "we return to the negative branch @xmath137 .",
    "horizons are defined by the following condition : @xmath151 which appears when the inequality @xmath152 following from : @xmath153 holds .    to clarify , it is enough to consider a simpler case @xmath154 .",
    "then , can be rewritten in the form : @xmath155 such a configuration becomes a black hole , when the positive mass parameter @xmath27 achieves the critical value @xmath156 .",
    "the equation is 4th order .",
    "its analytical solution for the expression @xmath156 exists and can be obtained , using the discriminant of resolvent @xmath157 in fact , it defines a radius for an unique horizon @xmath158 .",
    "1 illustrates the situations presented by the inequality derived for the @xmath154 case : the upper curve corresponds to the case without horizons ( naked singularity ) , the middle curve corresponds to a single horizon , and the lower curve corresponds to the case with two horizons .",
    "h     functions for different masses , width=302 ]    here it is necessary to emphasise an interesting case with @xmath159 occurring for both branches @xmath134 .",
    "as the @xmath27 parameter is coupled to the total mass of the system , the @xmath159 case looks strange . to clarify , it is necessary to add the charge parameter @xmath28 to the consideration .",
    "firstly , the meaning of @xmath28 differs from the electric charge @xmath101 in electrodynamics .",
    "indeed , @xmath101 does not exist , when @xmath159 , in other words , the reisner - nordstrm - ads solution is meaningless for @xmath159 case .",
    "secondly , as discussed after , @xmath28 represents matter induced by additional dimensions .",
    "so , the condition @xmath159 restricts the consideration for the @xmath137 branch to @xmath146 condition .",
    "adding it to one finds that for @xmath159 the restriction @xmath146 is fulfilled for both branches . introducing the cutoff and , therefore , changing the integration limit from @xmath29 to @xmath93 in ( [ 12 ] ) , it appears to be possible to find a mass situated inside a sphere with the radius @xmath94 defined by @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath28 totally defines the gravitational interaction in spite of the massless solution .",
    "such gravitational potential unlike the newtonian s one has a fall - off behavior like @xmath160 analogously to the electric field one in ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "however , there are no electrically charged objects in the universe , because they would be immediately screened by opposite charged ones . from this point of view , a @xmath28-potential with the fall - off @xmath160 could be observed .",
    "for example , in combination with the usual newtonian potential it could describe an irregular dynamics in galaxies .",
    "so instead of the idea of dark matter as new physics it is possible to treat it as geometrical contribution from string - inspired higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "this idea requires additional study .",
    "now we switch to a configuration with @xmath159 in the case of the @xmath137 .",
    "then , is rewritten as @xmath161 one obtains easily that for @xmath162 there are no horizons , for @xmath163 one horizon appears and there is no a possibility for two horizons .",
    "a possibility to construct horizons for totally massless objects looks quite surprisingly . unlike gr , in the dm solution case the total mass determined by @xmath27",
    "does not describe all the gravitational properties of the solution .",
    "this assertion supports our proposal about an analogy between the charge @xmath28 and a tidal charge from dadhich - rezania solution @xcite that describes bulk gravity influence at the brane .",
    "so , it turns out that gravitational effects related with @xmath28 are also induced by additional dimensions .",
    "here we have to recall that a massless black holes described by one parameter in the lovelock gravity are discussed in @xcite .",
    "now , we present a generic picture with arbitrary values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite expression in the following form : @xmath164 recall that it is a condition for existence of horizons , which exist in the case of the negative @xmath137 branch only . in the left hand side of",
    "there is a fourth order parabolic equation , while on the right hand side is linear one .",
    "if we draw plots of the parabola from left hand side of and the line from right hand side of , we see only three possibilities of mutual curves positions .",
    "first one is when line lies completely under parabola , and means an absence of horizons .",
    "second case is when line crosses parabola at two points .",
    "hence , there are two horizons .",
    "lastly , when line is tangential to parabola , the equation in contains a single horizon only .",
    "these arguments show that there are three areas on @xmath27-@xmath28 parameters phase - space , corresponding to naked singularity configuration , one and two horizons configurations . fig .",
    "2 presents a corresponding diagram . to find the configurations with one horizon",
    "it is necessary to use the standard calculus .",
    "a `` one - horizon curve '' is defined by the following parameterization @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the point , at which the straight line touches the parabola . in the fig .",
    "2 it is drawn by a dashed curve on the right part of the picture .",
    "the condition shows that the area below the one - horizon curve is two - horizon configurations zone .",
    "analogously the area above the one - horizon curve is to be the naked singularity configurations zone .",
    "however , it is so at @xmath167 .",
    "indeed , if this naked singularity is allowed , we have to set @xmath145 , but then from the relation @xmath146 follows only . therefore , the area of naked singularity with a positive charge @xmath28 is forbidden , see fig .",
    "only positive values of @xmath28 are restricted by . to state the sense of the area under line @xmath168 ( more exactly @xmath169 ) at the right part of the fig .",
    "2 one has to use the same arguments , which are used for the case @xmath159 and @xmath169 .",
    "one finds immediately that it is the one horizon zone .",
    "to finish the discussion on fig .",
    "2 , we return to the positive @xmath170 branch and use , that represents a curve at the left part of the picture , which divides it onto a forbidden zone and zone of naked singularity .",
    "it seems to be interesting to compare the description of the dm objects with charged schwarzschild or charged schwarzschild - ads solutions .",
    "everywhere the relations between two parameters , mass and charge , define whether there are two or one horizon or naked singularity configurations .",
    "the critical mass - charge relation defines the condition for one - horizon configuration existence that can be seen from fig .",
    "it is important to notice that configurations situated left from the dadhich - molina critical charge plot are forbidden .",
    "we also skip @xmath171 area , because for the charged solutions in gr this region is non - physical .        as one can conclude from fig.3 , the dm charge acts in a manner , different from electric one .",
    "this statement supports the assert that @xmath28 in dm solution is rather gravitational charge describing the contribution of additional dimensions .    concluding this section",
    ", we would like to point out that the md solution generalizes the dm one .",
    "we do not perform the study of the md solution because its behavior is exactly the same as for dm case .",
    "for example , increasing number of additional dimensions only shifts a one - horizon curve to a higher position .",
    "the unique parameter of the md solution @xmath172 is the weyl s tensor of additional dimensions as the normalization factor .",
    "a smaller @xmath172 defines lowering the one - horizon curve .",
    "orbital effects play an important role in black hole - like solutions , as they are coupled with an accretion picture that is actually observed @xcite .",
    "we assume cosmological and astronomical scales and , therefore , can use several approximations .",
    "we assume that solution has a mass of stellar range or higher , hence one may work with series expansion of a metric .",
    "thus , it is possible to use the asymptotic series .",
    "we work both with @xmath136 and @xmath137 branches , because asymptotically orbital effects depend upon the @xmath27 and @xmath28 only .    because the md metric is static and spherical symmetric the standard method presented in the chandrasekhar book @xcite",
    "can be applied effectively to study stable orbits .",
    "already , this method has been used in @xcite for examining the dadhich - rezania solution @xcite that has many similar properties with the dm solution .",
    "therefore , not repeating here the derivation of an application of the chandrasekhar method , we rather compare the results of its application to both the dm solution and the dadhich - rezania solution .",
    "if parameter @xmath28 takes a positive value , the expression transforms into the reissner - nordstrm form that describes black hole with electric charge , although @xmath28 is not related with electric charge .",
    "if @xmath28 has a negative value , the expression transforms into the aforementioned dadhich - rezania solution @xcite that describes a black - hole in the randall - sundrum ii model and has the form : @xmath173 where @xmath27 is solution s mass , @xmath174 describes bulk influence .",
    "the dadhich - rezania solution and its properties were studied in @xcite . as was established in @xcite , the critical dependence @xmath174 upon mass exists and",
    "has the form @xmath175 .",
    "the dadhich - rezania solution turns to the schwarzschild one if @xmath174 is sufficiently smaller than squared solution mass .",
    "it was shown that the critical dependence of @xmath174 upon mass has the form : @xmath176 if @xmath174 is bigger than @xmath177 , test particles orbits change @xcite as the quasinormal modes for the scattering @xcite and the shadow size of the black hole @xcite .",
    "it is possible to adopt the limitation to the dm solution and to obtain the same one for @xmath28 , which would define an area where orbital effects scattering effects and shadow size is different from gr case : @xmath178 engaging the recent data on m87 galaxy @xcite , we see that there is no evidence in dadhich - rezania model manifestation , so the real difference between the dm solution and the schwarchild one is negligible small for existing accuracy level .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that the dm solution fits . for @xmath136 branch",
    "the parameter @xmath28 can not take values bigger than @xmath179 .",
    "hence , for large masses there is an area of small @xmath28 values .",
    "the @xmath28 existence influences the mentioned effects .",
    "further , for big masses charge values are also limited from above .",
    "asymptotically this limitation acts like @xmath180 .",
    "so , any allowed dm black hole with positive charge has the properties similar to ones in gr .",
    "nevertheless , restriction allows to exclude the area with large negative values of @xmath28 .",
    "hawking radiation is the other important effect that provides an instrument for model testing at cosmological scales .",
    "we use both the hawking method @xcite and the shankaranarayanan - padmanabhan - srinivasan ( sps ) one @xcite .",
    "the sps approach operates with semiclassical wave - functions and describes black hole evaporation in terms of quantum tunneling .",
    "the method gives the dm temperature in the following form : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the residue of @xmath137 function on the horizon .",
    "the hawking method gives expression for temperature in terms of surface gravity : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is surface gravity .",
    "it is defined as a coefficient in @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is normalized killing vector that is normal to horizon , @xmath187 is a covariant derivative constructed from the dynamical metric .",
    "we performed numerical calculations for @xmath154 and both for the hawking and the sps method .",
    "both strategies lead to similar results and provide temperature - mass dependence shown on the fig .",
    "an interesting particularity of the discussed model is that the temperature grows with @xmath27 parameter increasing .",
    "similar behavior takes place in schwarzschild - ads - like solution @xcite , but for sufficiently big masses only .",
    "if the mass is small , the temperature of the schwarzschild - ads - like black hole decreases with increasing mass . note that there is the temperature area that is unreachable for black holes .",
    "however , the dm solution temperature only increases with increasing mass , the temperature can achieve arbitrary values .",
    "numerical calculations show that the decreasing of @xmath28 corresponds to the temperature growth . in gr black holes with electrical charge",
    "have the same temperature - charge dependence . strictly speaking",
    ", @xmath28 appears to change during the evaporation because properties of outgoing thermal radiation are defined by horizon geometry only .",
    "in contrast , it is crucially to point out that @xmath28 must not change during evaporation , because it describes the influence of additional dimensions , and their properties are independent of the 4d black hole local topology .    within the discussed assumption we estimate that the lifetime of a black hole is infinite .",
    "this effect appears because of the temperature decreasing with the dm mass decreasing , which means that the evaporation rate becomes smaller during the evaporation .",
    "this conclusion is the opposite to the usual hawking evaporation model .",
    "in addition , the temperature also depends upon @xmath28 and evaporation rate of black holes with different @xmath28 values strongly differs .",
    "for instance , all black holes on the single horizon curve do not evaporate .    in this context",
    ", the question about the final state of a black hole evaporation arises .",
    "one can see that within assumption on @xmath28 behavior during evaporation of dm black holes with @xmath162 takes a configuration from one horizon curve as final state .",
    "all these configurations have non zero masses , not depending upon the initial mass of a black hole . in order to obtain the final value of mass for the evaporating dm black hole one should solve eqs . with respect to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the initial dm black hole charge .",
    "moreover , for @xmath162 any final state is a black hole one . for dm black holes with initial @xmath28 smaller than @xmath188",
    "the final states of evaporation are black holes with zero @xmath27 parameter and non zero @xmath28 value .",
    "one could conclude that such a situation leads to a contradiction , as in final state the dm black hole has zero mass .",
    "this is not true .",
    "calculations of mass from section iii are performed with respect to infinite distant observer . in reality",
    "one observes a black hole from huge , but finite distance .",
    "hence the expression for mass , measuring by the earth observer , contains the terms depending on @xmath28 and @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is distance to a black hole .",
    "therefore the final state of the dm black holes with @xmath191 has non zero mass . within the assumption of @xmath28 conservation during the evaporation one comes to a conclusion that such a state belongs to the dm black hole one . in order to obtain the precise value one should accurately calculate the evaporation rate , taking into account backreaction .",
    "we do not do this here because the endpoint masses of the evaporating black holes with @xmath191 are too small to be found in observations .    summarizing the results of this section ,",
    "we conclude that the evaporation strongly depends upon the initial charge @xmath28 . until one",
    "estimates the charge of the dm black hole , it is impossible to find the black holes endpoint mass after the evaporation .",
    "similar , one has no right to make any conclusion about the evaporation rate of the dm black hole until @xmath28 parameter is unknown .",
    "in this work we studied maeda - dadhich solution obtained in the framework of @xmath192 einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we proved the solution stability under linear perturbations , therefore , maeda - dadhich metrics is valid for the description of real astrophysical black holes .",
    "we investigated the existence of the solution in positive mass region that was not mentioned in the original papers @xcite .",
    "we found additional limitations on solution parameters ( section v ) that resulted in valuable consequences .",
    "the positive branch is valid only for a naked singularity description , while the negative one could describe a black hole with one or two horizons .",
    "we established that the black hole temperature is not governed by hawking evaporation law and this fact causes additional limitations on the maeda - dadhich black hole .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy of existing data on compact objects accretion can not allow to distinguish thermodynamically stable maeda - dadhich black holes from usual schwarzschild ones .",
    "our result agrees with the estimations obtained earlier @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to the recent results of @xcite , the study of accretion disc shadows and neutral particles scattering can not help in this regard .",
    "therefore , the maeda - dadhich solution can describe astrophysical black holes , but current astronomical data does not allow to distinguish them from schwarzschild ones from general relativity .",
    "concluding , we make two remarks . first , gravitational lensing are considered for testing the presence of both black holes and naked singularities in universe , see @xcite and references there in .",
    "we do not check such a possibility here , but plan this in future .",
    "second , it is not secret that egb gravity is criticized from different sides .",
    "so , in @xcite it is shown that the egb gravity violates causality on general grounds with the lagrangian ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the authors @xcite assert that the only way to avoid this problem is by adding an infinite tower of massive higher - spin particles with a delicate tuning in their couplings .",
    "what we describe here is also no the study of the egb gravity in the general form of the lagrangian ( 2.1 ) , but we study it at the kaluza - klein split and creating matter by additional dimensions .",
    "in fact , we consider `` effective '' gr with the equations , where , at least , a problem of causality does not appear .",
    "thus , there is no a contradiction with such a criticism .",
    "this work was partially supported by individual grants from dmitry zimin foundation `` dynasty '' ( s.a . & b.l . ) .",
