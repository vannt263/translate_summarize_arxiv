    "if the acceleration potential is assumed to be equal to the maximum acceleration potential , the corresponding braking index is always equal to 3 . considering the effect of pulsar death or inclination angle evolution",
    ", the braking index will be larger than 3 .",
    "however , in physical acceleration models for pulsar magnetospheres , the acceleration potential is different from the maximum acceleration potential ( xu & qiao 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "recent observations and modeling also show possible evidence of a much higher particle density in the pulsar magnetosphere ( kou & tong 2015 and references therein ) . by considering these two aspects , the corresponding expression of wind braking model",
    "is obtained .    in the original version of the wind braking model ( xu & qiao 2001 ) , the dimensionless torque is @xmath79 .",
    "an additional angular factor @xmath80 is present .",
    "this kind of combination is also found in contopoulos & spitkovsky ( 2006 ) . in previous works of wind braking of pulsars , the possible evolution of pulsar inclination angle is not considered and the inclination angle is constant . since the particle density and inclination angle always appeared as @xmath81 , for a constant inclination angle , there is degeneracy between the particle number density @xmath22 and @xmath80 ( rogers & safi - harb 2017 ) .",
    "if there is no @xmath80 in the @xmath25 function , all the previous results can be obtained by replacing the corresponding particle density @xmath22 by @xmath81 .",
    "this kind of ambiguity is already known when applying the wind braking model to intermittent pulsars ( li et al .",
    "2014 ) . in order to keep consistent with previous works ,",
    "the @xmath80 factor is kept .",
    "when not considering the evolution of pulsar inclination angle , this ambiguity will not affect the physical results . according to the relation between pulsar spin - down and alignment ( philippov et al .",
    "2014 ) , the inclination angle evolves to decrease the spin - down torque . if there is a @xmath80 in the dimensionless torque , then : ( 1 ) in the dipole radiation dominated case ( @xmath25 is dominated by the dipole term which is proportional to @xmath70 ) , the inclination will decrease will time .",
    "( 2 ) as the pulsar evolves , the particle component begins to dominate ( @xmath25 is dominated by the particle term which is proportional to @xmath80 ) and the inclination angle will increase with time . however , statistically the pulsar inclination angle tends to decrease with time ( lyne & manchester 1988 ; tauris & manchester 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , compared with the observations of pulsar inclination angle , the possible @xmath80 factor may not appear .",
    "the evolution of inclination angle in the wind braking model ( equation [ alignment ] ) is done in analogy with that of magnetic dipole braking and mhd simulations .",
    "apart from a different numerical factor , the alignment equation in the magnetic dipole case and mhd case can be viewed as the same ( equation ( 7 ) and equation ( 15 ) in philippov et al .",
    "this is because they have the same dipole term , the term proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "the term independent of the inclination angle in the spin - down torque does not contribute to the alignment torque .",
    "since the wind braking model has the same dipole term , it is possible that the equation for inclination angle evolution is also the same . furthermore , according to the prescription of philippov et al .",
    "( 2014 , equation ( 33 ) there ) , equation ( [ alignment ] ) can be deduced when assuming that the coefficient a and b are independent of the inclination angle . even if a or b depends on the inclination angle , the inclination angle will always decrease with time for the spin - down torque of equation ( [ rotation ] ) .",
    "the resulting change is only quantitative . at the early age ,",
    "when the magnetic dipole radiation dominates the spin - down torque , for a decreasing inclination angle , the corresponding braking index may also be larger than three .",
    "it is tempting to combine the mhd simulations with some amount of particle outflow .",
    "then the dimensionless spin - down torque will be of the form : @xmath82 . for young pulsars with",
    "braking index measured , their inclination angle may not have decreased significantly , see figure [ galphaomega ] . for an inclination angle of @xmath50 , in the particle wind dominated case , the `` particle term '' will be significantly larger than the dipole term which is proportional to @xmath83",
    ". then if the dipole term is replaced by the mhd results , the `` particle term '' will also be larger than the mhd term which is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , mathematically , such a combination will not affect the braking index evolution of young pulsars .",
    "numerical calculations also confirm this analysis . furthermore , when the particle acceleration is introduced in some way in magnetospheric simulations ( li et al .",
    "2012 ; kalapotharakos et al . 2012",
    "; philippov et al .",
    "2015 ) , such a combination of `` mhd + particle term '' is not found .",
    "the main modification is the term `` 1 '' in the mhd simulations ( li et al .",
    "this may tells us that this term `` 1 '' is associated with particle accelerations .",
    "therefore , the results of resistive magnetospheric simulations are not in strong support for such a combination .",
    "however , such a combination can not be ruled out at present .",
    "the study of pulsar braking index is not very sensitive to discriminate between the two cases of `` dipole+particle wind '' or `` mhd+particle wind '' .",
    "both a `` @xmath70 '' and `` @xmath85 '' term will result in a braking index of three .",
    "other pulsar observations may help to solve this problem , e.g. intermittent pulsars etc .    in summary , the importance of a particle outflow is stressed in the wind braking model .",
    "this particle term will result in a braking index smaller than three . compared with the results of mhd simulations",
    ", there may be many assumptions in the wind braking model .",
    "however , these uncertainties will not affect the final conclusions .",
    "if future pulsar magnetosphere simulations can model the particle acceleration and injection into the magnetosphere more physically , the basic assumptions of the wind braking model can be tested .",
    "lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) had analyzed the polarization information of hundreds of pulsars .",
    "the statistical studies showed that the inclination angle distribution for young pulsar is uniform but aligned for older pulsars ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) . by studying two groups of pulsar polarization data ,",
    "tauris & manchester ( 1998 ) made a further studies and they concluded that the pulsar inclination angle tends to align . the inclination angle evolution in the wind braking model is consistent with these observations .",
    "lyne et al . (",
    "2013 ) proposed that the inclination angle of the crab pulsar is increasing with an increasing rate @xmath86 per century . on the one hand ,",
    "an increasing inclination angle is one of the possible explanations to the steady increase in the separation of the main pulse and interpulse of the crab pulsar ( lyne et al .",
    "on the other hand , the increasing inclination angle may be caused by the pulsar precession in the non - spherical case ( arzamasskiy et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "there are also other works to explain the observed high braking index of psr j1640@xmath64631 .",
    "braking index will be larger than @xmath0 in the plasma filled magnetosphere because of the inclination angle alignment ( eksi et al .",

    "however , these works only try to explain the braking index observations of larger than @xmath0 .    in the wind braking model , the braking index in the early time can be larger than three , depending on the parameter space , see figure [ gnt1640 ] . ] when considering the possible evolution of inclination angle . at later time",
    ", it will evolve from about three to about one .",
    "therefore , a general anticipation is that pulsars with higher braking index should be younger than those with lower braking index .",
    "the pulsar braking index should evolve from psr j1640@xmath64631-like case ( larger than three ) , to that of crab - like case ( about three ) , then to vela - like case ( about one ) .",
    "there is marginal evidence for the braking index evolution ( espinoza 2013 ) . at later time",
    ", the effect of pulsar death will lead the pulsar to the death valley ( figure [ gppdot ] ) .",
    "a very large braking index may be expected in this case . however , for these old pulsars , the fluctuation in magnetosphere will dominate the frequency second derivatives . and the observed @xmath87 may be dominated by the fluctuation of the magnetosphere ( i.e. , timing noise , ou et al . 2016 ) .",
    "the possible evolution of pulsar braking index discussed above are for the long term evolutions .",
    "two kinds of short term evolutions of pulsar braking index are possible ( kou et al .",
    "2016 ) : ( 1 ) a discrete change of particle density . for a higher particle density",

    "( 2 ) a secular change of particle density .",
    "an increasing particle density will result in a lower braking index , while not affecting the spin - down rate significantly .",

    "<S> the minimum braking index is about one . </S>",
    "<S> this can explain the existence of high braking index larger than @xmath0 , and low braking index of pulsars simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar braking index is expected to evolve from larger than three to about one . </S>",
    "<S> a general trend is that the pulsar braking index will evolve from the crab - like case to the vela - like case . </S>"
