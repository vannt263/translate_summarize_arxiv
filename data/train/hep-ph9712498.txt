    "we are here to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the @xmath6 discovery . because of this historic setting",
    ", i will dwell a little more on the historical aspects ( from a personal perspective ) of gluonic penguins , before i turn to the current .",
    "shortly after 1977 , bander , silverman and soni ( bss ) @xcite suggested the mechanism of ( direct ) cp violation in the _ decay _ of @xmath7 quarks .",
    "the @xmath0-penguin was born , as illustrated in fig .",
    "cp violation is possible because all 3 generations run in the loop , while on - shell @xmath8 rescattering provides the second @xmath9 , an absorptive part .",
    "tony sanda told me that this work was an inspiration for his mixing dependent cp violation ideas .",
    "3.8 cm    perhaps influenced by bss , guberina , peccei and r \" uckl pointed out @xcite in late 1979 , using operator language , that @xmath0-penguin operators  can alter the ` natural ' cabibbo pattern of the kobayashi  maskawa model . \" namely , @xmath10 is possible , since the penguin is @xmath11 , while tree level @xmath12 could be suppressed if @xmath13 is very small .",
    "this has just turned into fact this year with cleo s observation of a few 2-body rare decays @xcite .",
    "following the study of @xmath14 decay in the early 80 s , eilam @xcite added @xmath15 of fig .",
    "1(b ) to the  parton \" estimate of the inclusive penguin rate . in 1987 ,",
    "the so - called  large \" qcd correction to @xmath14 was discovered , leading to the  operator \" approach industry . but @xmath15 changed only from 0.1% to 0.2% with qcd corrections , much less dramatic than the @xmath14 case .",
    "the inclusive gluonic penguin was clarified @xcite in 1987 by noting the @xmath16 of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( timelike , lightlike and spacelike ) , where the latter , given in fig .",
    "1(c ) , is the familiar looking  penguin \" from kaon physics .",
    "it was found that @xcite @xmath20 while @xmath21 .",
    "however , counter to one s intuition @xcite , @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the 3-body @xmath23 at @xmath24 dominates over the 2-body @xmath15 at @xmath25 , which comes about because of a subtlety of gim cancellation .",
    "there are two conserved effective @xmath26 couplings ; ignoring @xmath13 they are @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 contains large logarithms while @xmath31 does not , but suffers from power gim suppression .",
    "however , @xmath30 can not contribute to @xmath15 because of the @xmath16 factor .",
    "thus , the subtle higher order dominance comes about because of having a logarithmic and a power gim suppressed effective coupling , and only the latter leads to @xmath15 .",
    "the above subtlty leads to surprising @xmath1 effects : @xmath32 is very sensitive to low @xmath34 . for the higgs sector of minimal susy ,",
    "the effect is always constructive and does not vanish with @xmath35 ( ratio of v.e.v.s of the two higgs doublets ) @xcite , which holds similarly for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "though @xmath15 could not be greatly enhanced in this model , both strong enhancement / suppression of @xmath14 are possible for a second model , and @xmath15 could become _ very _ enhanced @xcite .    at that time the experimental limit was @xmath37 , while @xmath15 was practically without bound ( except @xmath38 should be dominant ) .",
    "the curious thing about @xmath15 is that it does not lead to any good , tangible signature ! by 1992 , however , the cleo limit on @xmath39 improved to @xmath40 , entering the domain of sm predictions .",
    "this had a dramatic implication that @xmath41 gev or so @xcite in susy type models .",
    "unfortunately , because @xmath26 and @xmath42 couplings in higgs models are highly correlated , the limit and eventual observation of @xmath14 by cleo meant that @xmath15 could no longer be strongly enhanced in usual charged higgs models @xcite .",
    "some indirect indications for enhanced @xmath15 appeared , in fact , in the early 90 s .",
    "as @xmath0 experiments matured , the semileptonic branching ratio ( @xmath3 ) steadily declined , from @xmath44 in 1986 , to 10.7% by early 1990 .",
    "theory predicted 1215% , hence it appeared @xcite that the sm had trouble with the experimental value , with a 1015% discrepancy .",
    "the relevant qcd scale @xmath45 for @xmath0 decay could be much lower than @xmath46 @xcite , or one could have _ new physics _",
    "@xmath471015% , which drives down @xmath3 via = ( b+ x)/ ( ^sm_tot .",
    "+ _ new ) . the new process must be relatively well hidden , and low in charm content to accommodate the analogously low charm counting rate @xcite ( the @xmath4 problem ) .",
    "two modes were suggested @xcite , both from @xmath1 effects .",
    "the first one , @xmath48 , was very quickly ruled out by a superb analysis job of aleph , which confirmed sm predictions .",
    "the second possibility of @xmath491015% , which is a charmless final state , was very difficult to rule out .",
    "however , by 1994 , the possibility of enhanced @xmath15 due to @xmath1 effects became implausible because of @xmath14 limits / measurements .",
    "subsequently , kagan @xcite suggested that tev scale physics responsible for quark mass ( and mixing ) generation might lead to enhanced @xmath15 .",
    "for example , gluonic insertions to @xmath50 mass terms could result in effective @xmath51 couplings . to disentangle @xmath15 from @xmath14",
    ", one must employ more _ color _ in the loop .",
    "note that @xmath1 is colorless and does not couple to gluons , hence diagrams for @xmath15 are only a subset of @xmath14 . but gluons could more readily couple to gluinos via susy @xmath52 couplings @xcite ( with flavor violation in squark mass matrix ) , or to techniscalars @xcite . in this way @xmath15 could in principle be separated from @xmath14 and be strongly enhanced .",
    "the problems of low @xmath3 and @xmath4 have persisted to this day , despite much theoretical and experimental effort .",
    "two recent analyses @xcite give @xmath53 and @xmath54 , both low by about 1015% .",
    "the problem could still be experimental , and in fact the latest results hint at softening of the problems , but two views are offered on enhanced charmless @xmath7 decays .",
    "kagan and rathsman @xcite think that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and kaon excess in @xmath0 decays together hint at @xmath551015% .",
    "using jetset fragmentation of the @xmath56 quark , they find the @xmath57 spectrum to be rather soft , hence @xmath15 indeed hides well . on the other hand , dunietz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest that half of @xmath58 ( expected at 2030% level ) has disappeared into light hadrons .",
    "the effect has to be nonperturbative to evade the perturbative @xmath59 1% discussed earlier .",
    "the proposed mechanism is via a @xmath60 hybrid meson , since the @xmath61 pair is mainly in color octet configuration .",
    "the hybrid should @xcite be favorably produced in @xmath62 , should be relatively narrow ( long lived ) and should have suppressed decays into @xmath63 and usual charmonia .",
    "hence @xcite , in a sense it is no less exotic than new physics @xmath64 1015% .",
    "1997 will be remembered as the year of the strong penguin . since the aspen winter conference",
    ", cleo has reported the first observations of a host of two - body rare @xmath0 decays .",
    "@xmath66 is observed , while @xmath67 is not , confirming the gpr suggestion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath68 mode is larger than expected , while @xmath69 is huge , but @xmath70 is not seen !",
    "all in all , we see that penguins are large .",
    "what is even more astounding is the observation of @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "while a cut on @xmath74 is in part to suppress background , it is astonishing to see so many events in this rather unusual channel .",
    "if one extrapolates from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , one could easily saturate @xmath75 .",
    "the most prominent feature is that the @xmath65 is _ fast _ !",
    "since @xmath76 is the heaviest and  stickiest \" ( glue rich ) of the lowest lying mesons , it would have been last on the list of possible fast , leading particles in @xmath0 decay searches .",
    "there is one thing unique to @xmath65 , however , namely its connection to the gluon anomaly . @xmath77-@xmath65",
    "mixing is said to be related to the axial u@xmath78 problem , and the symmetry is broken by the @xmath79 gluon anomaly .",
    "indeed , in the chiral limit of @xmath80 ( assuming @xmath81 of light flavors ) , one has @xmath82 , and it is this large , _ topological _ glue content of @xmath65 that makes it so heavy .",
    "so , is the @xmath65 production linked to @xmath15 ?",
    "atwood and soni @xcite ( as ) have indeed made such a connection , linking @xmath85 to inclusive @xmath65 via the @xmath65-@xmath83-@xmath83 gluon anomaly . defining the phenomenological coupling @xmath86",
    ", they extract @xmath87 gev@xmath88 from @xmath89 decay . assuming that @xmath90 is constant , they find that the sm @xmath91 could account for eq .",
    "however , they seem to have mistaken @xmath92 for @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",
    "they hence have a false sensitivity to fermi motion .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of constant @xmath95 is definitely too strong .",
    "the @xmath16 ranges from 0 to @xmath96 , way beyond the qcd scale that determines @xmath97 .",
    "we shall assume that form factor effects do not set in , which in itself is already a big assumption .",
    "but even then , for such a broad range of @xmath16 , one does not expect couplings to stay constant .",
    "this is especially so since one finds that @xmath92 peaks at large @xmath98 gev ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .",
    "so , let us try @xcite to understand the @xmath65-@xmath83-@xmath83 coupling better .",
    "the @xmath65 problem in qcd is in itself an active field of research .",
    "the anomaly coupling comes from the wess - zumino term , without assuming pcac and soft pions , @xmath99 where @xmath100 of as .",
    "the explicit @xmath101 factor strongly suggests that one should use running coupling . in the case at hand , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the dominant scale , we expect @xmath104 . as a cross check",
    ", we find that @xmath105 gev@xmath106 of as , but for larger @xmath16 , this would suppress the sm @xmath107 effect , since the strong coupling changes by a factor of 2 from @xmath108 gev to @xmath46 scale .",
    "we find @xcite a factor of 1/3 suppression of sm @xmath91 , hence @xmath109 is precisely what is called for .",
    "it is interesting that both @xmath110 and @xmath111 effects are needed .",
    "furthermore , because in the sm the @xmath30-@xmath31 interference effect is destructive , the sign of @xmath112 should be opposite to that in the sm , which is precisely what is found in the susy example of @xmath84 @xcite !    5.8 cm      for inclusive @xmath114 transitions , it is known that @xcite @xmath115 , due to the smallness of @xmath116 and unitarity constraints . however , because of the appearance of the @xmath117 field in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the @xmath112 dipole coupling probes new phases that are independent of ckm phase .",
    "at the same time , the @xmath118 coupling , which is needed also to acocunt for the rate , provides the necessary rescattering phase , from the @xmath61 cut in fig .",
    "the differential br s @xmath119 and @xmath120 are shown in fig .",
    "2 , assuming phase difference @xmath121 between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . note that , thanks to the anomaly @xmath65-@xmath83-@xmath83 coupling , although @xmath16 is not a physical variable , @xmath122 directly corresponds to the physical recoil mass against @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , large @xmath16 ( hence fast @xmath65 ) is favored by the anomaly coupling !",
    "the upshot is that we can account for the huge branching ratios that are _ already observed _ , while the asymmetry @xmath123 in @xmath124 . in principle , cleo could probe this asymmetry very soon .",
    "the sm expectation that @xmath125 and @xmath126 is quite firm . however , persistent @xmath3 and @xmath4 problems hint at the possibility of @xmath84 from new physics .",
    "the recent observation of spectacularly large semi - inclusive @xmath127 where @xmath128 gev poses an additional challenge to the sm .",
    "it is proposed that large @xmath15 leads to large @xmath129 through the gluon anomaly .",
    "we find that , with running @xmath101 in the @xmath17-@xmath83-@xmath65 coupling , both sm @xmath75 and new physics @xmath84 are needed , to feed down to @xmath129 .",
    "the anomaly coupling preferentially leads to fast @xmath65 mesons .",
    "since the new physics color dipole transition involves right - handed couplings to the @xmath7 quark , one probes a new cp violating phase that is independent of ckm .",
    "the @xmath129 mode is already observed at 0.1% level . with 10% @xmath130 possible because of the interplay of sm and new physics , perhaps cp violation could be observed before 1999 , the year that b factories turn on .",
