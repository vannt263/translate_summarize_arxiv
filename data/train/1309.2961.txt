    "the modified weibull ( mw ) distribution is one of the most important distributions in lifetime modeling , and some well - known distributions are special cases of it .",
    "this distribution was introduced by lai , xie , and murthy ( 2003 ) to which we refer the reader for a detailed discussion as well as applications of the mw distribution ( in particular , the use of a real data set representing failure times to illustrate the modeling and estimation procedure ) .",
    "also sarhan and zaindin ( 2008 ) introduced the modified weibull distribution .",
    "it can be used to describe several reliability models .",
    "it has three parameters , two scale and one shape parameters .",
    "recently , carrasco , ortega , and cordeiro ( 2008 ) , ortega , cordeiro , and carrasco ( 2011 ) extended the mw distribution by adding another shape parameter and introducing a four parameter generalized mw ( gmw ) and log - gmw ( lgmw ) . in section 8 of carrasco",
    "2008 ) two applications of gmw in serum - reversal data and radiotherapy data are presented to which we refer the interested reader for details . in section 6 of ortega et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , an application of lgmw in survival times for the golden shiner data is presented .",
    "although in many applications an increase in the number of parameters provides a more suitable model , in the characterization problem a lower number of parameters ( without affecting the suitability of the model ) is mathematically more appealing ( see glanzel and hamedani , 2001 ) , especially in the mw case which already has a shape parameter .",
    "so , we restrict our attention to the mw and log - mw ( lmw ) distributions . in the applications where",
    "the underlying distribution is assumed to be mw ( or lmw ) , the investigator needs to verify that the underlying distribution is in fact the mw ( or lmw ) . to this end",
    "the investigator has to rely on the characterizations of these distributions and determine if the corresponding conditions are satisfied .",
    "thus , the problem of characterizing the mw ( or lmw ) become essential .",
    "a random variable @xmath0 is said to have modified weibull distribution if cumulative distribution function(cdf ) is@xmath1where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is a scale parameter , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are shape parameters .",
    "the corresponding probability density function(pdf ) is@xmath8and the hazard function is given by@xmath9one can easily verify from that :    a.   the hazard function is constant when @xmath10 ; b.   when @xmath11 , the hazard function is decreasing ; and c.   the hazard function will be increasing if @xmath12 .",
    "consider an arbitrary parent cdf @xmath13 .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath14 of the new class of distributions called the mc - donald generalized distributions ( denoted with the prefix `` mc '' for short ) is defined by@xmath15 ^{b-1},\\]]where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are additional shape parameters .",
    "( see corderio et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for additional details ) .",
    "note that @xmath18 is the pdf of parent distribution , @xmath19 .",
    "introduction of this additional shape parameters is specially to introduce skewness .",
    "also , this allows us to vary tail weight .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath20 we obtain a sub - model of this generalization which is a beta generalization ( see eugene et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) and for @xmath21 , we have the kumaraswamy ( kw ) , [ kumaraswamy generalized distributions ( see cordeiro and castro , ( 2010 ) ) . for random variable @xmath0 with density function ,",
    "we write @xmath22",
    ". the probability density function will be most tractable when @xmath13 and @xmath18 have simple analytic expressions .",
    "the corresponding cumulative function for this generalization is given by@xmath23where @xmath24 denotes the incomplete beta function ratio ( gradshteyn & ryzhik , 2000 ) .",
    "equation can also be rewritten as follows@xmath25 where @xmath26is the well - known hypergeometric functions which are well established in the literature ( see , gradshteyn and ryzhik ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "some mathematical properties of the cdf @xmath27 for any mc - g distribution defined from a parent @xmath13 in equation , could , in principle , follow from the properties of the hypergeometric function , which are well established in the literature ( gradshteyn and ryzhik , 2000 , sec .",
    ". one important benefit of this class is its ability to skewed data that can not properly be fitted by many other existing distributions .",
    "mc - g family of densities allows for higher levels of flexibility of its tails and has a lot of applications in various fields including economics , finance , reliability , engineering , biology and medicine .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we demonstrate that the @xmath32 density function can be expressed as a linear combination of the modified weibull distribution .",

    "the mcdonald modified weibull distribution is very flexible model that approaches to different distributions when its parameters are changed .",
    "the @xmath32 distribution contains as special- models the following well known distributions .",
    "if @xmath0 is a random variable with pdf or cdf we use the notation @xmath41 @xmath42 then we have the following cases .    1 .   for @xmath20 , then reduces to the beta modified weibull @xmath43 distribution .",
