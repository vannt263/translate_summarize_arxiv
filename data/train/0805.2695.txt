    "the internal variable @xmath3 describing each neuron s potential , for @xmath4 evolves increasingly on time @xmath5 during the interspike intervals : @xmath6 has positive first derivative @xmath7 and negative second derivative @xmath8 being the solution of a deterministic autonomous differential equation of a wide general type .",

    "the instants of spiking are defined by the evolution of the system itself , and not predetermined by regular intervals of observation of the system .",
    "we analyze the state of the system immediately after each spike , in the sequence of instants of spiking of the network .",
    "we prove that the state of the system after each spike is a function @xmath15 of the state after the prior spike .",
    "this function @xmath15 is the so called poincar map .",
    "the study of the dynamics by iteration of the poincar map is not an artificial discretization of the real time dynamics . on the contrary ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath15 and its properties ( for instance periodicity , chaotic attractors ) are equivalent to those of the system evolving in real time .    in @xcite the technique of the first return poincar map to a section transversal to the flux",

    "we include the proof of these properties in the section 2 of this paper .    in section [ seccionperiodico ] , we prove theorem [ teorema1 ] , which is the main abstract mathematical result :    _ locally contractive piecewise continuous maps with the separation property generically have only periodic asymptotic behavior , with up to a finite number of limit cycles that are persistent under small perturbations of the map . _",

    "on the other hand non generic dynamics are structurable unstable : they are destroyed if the system is perturbed , even if the perturbation is arbitrarily small .",
