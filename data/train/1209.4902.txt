    "dust grains emit thermal emission characterized by a blackbody spectrum with an additional @xmath13 term to account for the emissivity of the dust @xcite .",
    "each galaxy will have a distribution of dust temperatures depending on the size and distribution of the dust relative to the heating sources ; the integrated ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) will be a combination of modified blackbodies from all dust components .",
    "most studies of high redshift galaxies fit a single modified blackbody template , assuming an average dust temperature , but there is evidence from local star - forming galaxies and ulirgs that at least two dust components are needed to obtain a good fit to the full ir sed @xcite .",
    "physically , this can be understood through the main regions where dust can be found in a galaxy : cool diffuse ( cirrus ) dust in the interstellar medium ; warmer dust in active star - forming regions ; and even warmer dust found in an agn torus @xcite . to study the properties of agn and star - forming ( sf ) galaxies at high redshift ,",
    "it is necessary to first identify systems likely harboring an agn .",

    "the final main features observed in the mid - ir spectrum of galaxies are due to silicate absorption , most clearly seen at 9.7@xmath0 m .",
    "this absorption feature can be due to either the agn or the star formation , since it is produced by a dust screen surrounding a hot emission region , though there is some observational evidence that it is more prevalent in agn with an optically thick dusty torus @xcite .",

    "the extinction curve is not monotonic in wavelength and contains silicate absorption features , the most notable for our wavelength range being at 9.7@xmath0 m . the local starburst composite and the m  82 template already contain some intrinsic extinction .",
    "we tested applying additional extinction to the sf component beyond that inherent in the templates and found this to be negligible for all sources .",
    "we fit all three components simultaneously and integrate under the starburst spectrum and power - law continuum to determine the fraction of the mid - ir luminosity ( @xmath3812@xmath0 m depending on the redshift of the source ) from sf and agn activity , respectively . for each source , we quantify the strength of the agn in terms of the percentage of the total mid - ir luminosity coming from the power - law continuum component . based on this mid - ir spectral decomposition , we find that 38 ( 25% ) out of our sample of 151 galaxies are dominated ( @xmath16  50% ) in the mid - ir by an agn .",

    "the mid - ir spectral features have been predicted to reveal the shape of the torus surrounding the agn .",
    "a clumpy torus produces a power - law spectrum and possibly weak silicate absorption , while the presence of strong silicate absorption suggests a thick obscuring torus @xcite .",
    "we therefore classify the agn according to the shape of their mid - ir spectrum ; those with measurable 9.7@xmath0 m silicate absorption ( hereafter referred to as silicate agn ) , and those without ( hereafter referred to as featureless agn ) , which we have classified by eye .",

    "recent work has suggested that the power - law portion of the agn spectrum continues to 20@xmath0 m , flattens , and then falls off after 40@xmath0 m @xcite . in this case , assigning a single temperature to this portion of the spectrum is misleading , since it is composed of many dust temperatures . however",

    "there is a known degeneracy between the dust emissivity , @xmath79 , and temperature , such that if we fix @xmath79 to a higher value , it will produce lower temperatures .",
    "we chose to fix @xmath79 rather than fit it along with the temperatures , but it is important to keep the degeneracy of the two parameters in mind when interpreting the temperatures .",
    "there is evidence that @xmath79 is universal on galaxy - wide scales @xcite , and as we fix it to the same value for every sub - sample , we do not expect that there is any bias created between the sub - samples in this study .    from our fitting",

    "it is tempting to try to place our sf- and agn - dominated galaxies into an evolutionary sequence , where the sf galaxies represent an early phase of active star formation , and the agn galaxies represent a later phase once the black hole has been fueled and is able to heat the dust to warmer temperatures and quench the star formation .",

    "@xcite discovered another tight correlation between the 8@xmath0 m luminosity , @xmath128 , and @xmath80 , mimicking the sfr-@xmath129 main sequence , and defined an alternate main sequence using the parameter ir8 = @xmath130 .",
    "ir8 is calibrated to distinguish between starbursting and main sequence sf galaxies , but it has been shown to be useful when applied to agn as well . we calculate the 8@xmath0 m luminosity of our sf and agn sources by applying the irac 8@xmath0 m passband to each composite sed in the rest frame .",
    "we calculate ir8 = @xmath130 for each composite and list the values in table [ lumtbl ] .",
    "we do not distinguish between main sequence and starburst galaxies for individual sources since we are interested in the average properties of our sub - samples . using a large sample of goods-_herschel _ galaxies , @xcite define the main sequence to be ir8 = 2.7 to 7.8 ( range is the 68% dispersion around the mean ir8 value of 4.9 ) .",
    "interestingly , ir8 for both of our agn composites fits comfortably within this range .",
    "the @xmath5 sf sed has an ir8 of 6.6 , which is well within the main sequence , while the @xmath6 sf sed , with an ir8 of 7.9 , lies just above the main sequence range .",
    "although most of the galaxies in our @xmath5 sf sub - sample are main sequence galaxies , the @xmath6 sf sub - sample may contain a mix of both main sequence galaxies and starbursts , according to the ir8 parameter .    during the active stages of a major merger ,",

    ", these effects act to produce a main - sequence ir8 value .",
    "second , both main sequence criteria may be limited in usefulness when discussing agn .",
    "a major merger may immediately trigger a starburst , but may take more time to funnel material to the agn , and this can produce a delay between starburst activity and a luminous agn on the order of @xmath132 yrs .",
    "it is possible that any signatures of a merger have disappeared before the galaxy displays strong agn signatures .",
    "based on the ir8 parameter , most of our agn and sf galaxies do not show enhanced ir luminosity and may not be a phase of the popular local ulirg major merger scenario , although they might still be linked in some other evolutionary sequence ( e.g.  involving minor mergers or cold gas accretion ) .",
    "naturally , our findings are only for the average of all of our high redshift sub - samples of galaxies and do not necessarily apply on an individual basis .     and",
    "@xmath6 sf seds ( top and bottom panel , respectively ) compared against the main sequence and starburst templates derived in @xcite . both the main sequence and starburst templates overpredict emission at far - ir / submm wavelengths ( @xmath133m).[ms_sb],width=288 ]    @xcite present templates for typical main sequence and starbursting galaxies , computed by stacking photometry for main sequence and starburst galaxies at @xmath134 from 3  350@xmath0 m .",

    "this is possibly due to a difference in the average intrinsic ir luminosity or redshifts for each of these templates .",
    "in addition , there are differences in the way the templates were created , which could also account for some of the variation in cold dust emission . @xcite only include the long wavelength spire photometry in their fit when there is a detection in the prior catalog whereas we include a spire measurement for every galaxy regardless of if it is a formal detection ( see  [ sec : sed ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite fit the far - ir data for individual sources ( requiring at least one measurement above 30 @xmath31 m rest wavelength ) with the ce01 templates to calculate each @xmath80 , and then normalized every source to the same @xmath80 before stacking to create their templates .",
    "this can introduce a degree of uncertainty since it requires an extrapolation between the data points .",
    "we normalize out sources in the mid - ir where we have the irs spectra so we do nt need to rely on any templates .",
    "the amplitude and shape of our seds at these longer wavelengths is validated by our stacked submm measurements ( see triangles in fig .",
    "[ ms_sb ] ) .",
    "most of the mismatch between the @xcite templates and ours in the submm is likely due to the fact that we are comparing sources at different redshifts and luminosities ; the @xcite seds include all galaxies at @xmath134 and will be weighted towards galaxies at @xmath137 with lower average @xmath80 , which may indeed be intrinsically cooler , than our sf composite seds .",
    "as shown earlier in section [ sec : compare ] , local templates do not fit the @xmath138 galaxies , and we expect the seds of star forming galaxies to start to evolve somewhere between @xmath135 and @xmath139 .",

    "according to @xcite , based on modeling local agn , the strength of the silicate absorption feature in our silicate agn sed does not necessarily require the sed to be heavily obscured ; nevertheless , there are significant differences between the silicate agn and featureless agn subsamples .",
    "interestingly , in our sample only 41% of silicate agn are individually detected in the deep _ chandra _ x - ray imaging , whereas 92% of featureless agn are detected in the x - ray .",
    "this supports the idea that the silicate agn are more heavily obscured , possibly even compton - thick @xcite , on an individual basis , while the featureless agn are less obscured and can have a stronger effect on the host galaxy .",
    "a more detailed study of the individual x - ray properties of our irs sample is reserved for a future paper .    broadly speaking",
    ", silicate agn may represent the transition stage from a star formation dominated galaxy to an unobscured agn , following the @xcite prescription for creating luminous qsos . for our agn sources",
    ", we assume the mid - ir emission arises from the hot dust torus surrounding the agn , while the emission at @xmath141 m arises from the cold dust heated by star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "the persistence of significant cold dust observed in our silicate agn suggests that these nuclei are not yet having a strong effect on the star formation occurring in the host galaxy .",
    "for an unobscured agn , the mid ir emission from the warm dust in the torus will dilute the dust emission in the surrounding galaxy , so the estimated amount of cold dust is suppressed or overrun by the warm dust .",
    "currently , a precise picture of agn feedback has not been proven , but one prominent line of thought is that as the agn becomes more powerful , the feedback from the agn is responsible for actively shutting down star formation .",
    "agn feedback could be responsible for the lack of any sf features or silicate absorption in the mid - ir , the suppression of cold dust emission , and the much lower sfr observed in our featureless agn compared to our silicate agn .",
    "alternatively , the featureless agn sources might just be more luminous agn , such that they outshine any of the host galaxy emission , although our inferred x - ray luminosities are inconsistent with this ( see  [ sec : xray ] ) .",
    "of course , while these scenarios are possible in general , based on the average properties of our sub - samples of galaxies , it is impossible to state that this is the case for every galaxy within each sub - sample , since we are probing a range of redshifts and @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , with the level of silicate absorption we see in our templates , it is difficult to distinguish between a clumpy and smooth torus geometry . in this case , it is possible that we are simply seeing identical agn at different viewing angles which produces the different shapes in the spectra .    while our seds are consistent with a scenario in which the featureless agn are in a later evolutionary stage than the silicate agn , and are having more of an impact on the host galaxy , evidenced by the lack of mid - ir features , the suppression of cold dust , and the higher x - ray detection fraction , we can not rule out other explanations for the differences between the seds . detailed modeling of emission from different agn components that contribute to our composite seds is beyond the scope of this paper . fully disentangling why ir luminous agn at high redshift have noticeably different spectral shapes",
    "is a necessary step to producing a complete picture of galaxy evolution .      looking only at the high redshift sf sources",
    ", we might ask whether there is evidence for evolution in the seds between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ composites ] that when normalized in the mid - ir or far - ir , our two sf composite seds are indistinguishable over 3 ",

    "when we compare the average ssfr = sfr/@xmath104 of our @xmath5 and @xmath6 sf galaxies , we find an increase of a factor of @xmath142 , consistent with the observed increase in the ssfr with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , galaxies with more dust emission ( as evidenced by a higher ir luminosity ) will have more extinction of the stellar bump .",
    "beyond these two effects , there is no evidence from our analysis that the seds of ir luminous sf galaxies evolve between @xmath1 = 1 and 2 , though we are comparing lirgs at @xmath5 with ulirgs at @xmath6 .",
    "the lack of any strong differences between our @xmath5 and @xmath143 sf seds is especially interesting , since the former are primarily normal main sequence galaxies , while the latter contain a mix of main sequence and starburst galaxies according to the ir8 parameter .",
    "this suggests that mergers either might not significantly alter the distribution of dust and gas in high redshift ulirgs , or might not be as prevalent as they are in local ulirgs .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the extended mid - ir emission for a large sample of local lirgs and ulirgs , and found that once the central component of the galaxy is removed , the average seds of lirgs and ulirgs are all remarkably similar in shape to the local starburst template of @xcite .",
    "their results imply that the differences between lirg and ulirg seds are due to processes taking place in the cores .",
    "high redshift ulirgs are more extended than their local counterparts , so the extended emission could be dominating the shape of the sed , causing little difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 seds .    on the other hand , we do see an evolution in the seds of sf galaxies when we compare our high redshift composite seds to those of local ulirgs .",
    "the general trend is that we find more of the ir luminosity is coming from colder dust at high redshift , whereas local ulirgs have more shorter wavelength far - ir emission from warmer dust .",
    "this was originally observed for high redshift submillimeter selected galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we now show that it extends to a larger high redshift ulirg population selected in the mid - ir .",
    "we argue that this result would not be as robust without modeling the ir emission with multiple dust components since a single dust component would bias the far - ir peak to slightly shorter wavelengths , and would fail to properly account for all of the substantial warmer dust .",
    "the presence of more cold dust in high redshift ulirgs is likely to be in part because they are more extended than local ulirgs ( even major mergers at high redshift are more extended ) allowing for a larger fraction of the dust to remain at cooler temperatures @xcite .",
    "an interesting test of our empirical sed templates would be to compare them to the expected seds from radiative transfer models that take into account the larger sizes of high redshift ulirgs .",
