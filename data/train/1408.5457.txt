    "the effects of uniform magnetic fields on relativistic quark matter have been studied extensively in recent years ( for an overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "the main interest arises from the relevance of these effects on the physics of neutron stars , as well as on the dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is known , that magnetars , a certain class of neutron stars , exhibit magnetic fields up to @xmath9 gau  on their surface , and @xmath10 gau  in their inner core @xcite . in @xcite , the dynamo effect during the first few seconds",
    "after the star s gravitational collapse is made responsible for the generation of these unusual magnetic fields .",
    "even larger magnetic fields are believed to be created in early stages of non - central heavy ion collisions .",
    "depending on the collision energies and impact parameters , the strength of these magnetic fields are estimated to be of the order @xmath11 gev@xmath12 at rhic and @xmath13 gev@xmath12 at lhc @xcite .",
    "gev@xmath12 corresponds to @xmath14 gau . ]",
    "the mechanism for the creation of strong magnetic fields in heavy ion collisions is originally discussed in @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review on this topic ) .",
    "a uniform and spatially constant magnetic field breaks the lorentz invariance of the physical system , and consequently induces anisotropies in the parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the direction of the background magnetic field .",
    "the anisotropies include those in the neutrino emission and magnetic winds in the astrophysics of magnetars @xcite , or anisotropies arising in the refraction indices @xcite , and decay constants of mesons in hot and magnetized quark matter @xcite . the latter may be relevant for the physics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "recently , the pressure anisotropies for a gas of protons and a gas of neutrons are studied in @xcite .",
    "it is , in particular , demonstrated that the inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) of protons and neutrons increases the level of anisotropies in both cases .",
    "pressure anisotropies , arising from uniform and spatially fixed magnetic fields , are supposed to have significant effects on the elliptic flow @xmath15 in heavy ion collisions @xcite .    in the present paper , we apply the method used in @xcite , to study the effect of various @xmath16 dependent and independent amm of quarks on the phase diagram of a two - flavor magnetized nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model at finite temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "we will explore the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis ( mc ) , and inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) , as well as the reentrance of chiral symmetry broken and restored phases in the phase space of our model .",
    "the phenomenon of reentrance is already observed in the condensed matter physics of superfluidity @xcite and liquid crystals @xcite , as well as in the astrophysics of neutron stars @xcite .    in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have already studied in detail the complete @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath1-@xmath2 , and @xmath0@xmath2 phase portraits of the magnetized two - flavor njl model , without inclusion of the quark amm .",
    "we mainly worked in the supercritical regime of the njl coupling , i.e. , the coupling constant of the njl model was chosen in such a way that the system exhibited chiral symmetry breaking even for vanishing magnetic fields . in this case , the magnetic field only enhances the production of bound states ; they consist of mesons in chiral symmetry broken phase ( @xmath17sb ) and diquarks in color symmetry broken phase . in this sense , in @xcite , we focused on the phenomenon of mc of chiral and color symmetry breaking , and reported about various interesting phenomena , such as de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) oscillations @xcite , that lead to reentrant chiral and color symmetry broken phases , mainly in the regime of weak magnetic fields .",
    "the phenomenon of mc is discussed intensively in many contexts @xcite . at zero temperature , it arises from a dimensional reduction from @xmath18 to @xmath19 dimensions in the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "this is believed to be responsible for the aforementioned enhancement of bound state formation . as a consequence , in a massless theory ,",
    "whose original lagrangian density satisfies the chiral symmetry , a finite mass is dynamically created , which then breaks the chiral symmetry of the theory .",
    "finite temperature and baryonic chemical potential compete with external magnetic fields in this regard , and , except in the regime of very strong magnetic fields , suppress the formation of mesonic bound states ( see @xcite for more details ) . in our model , this regime is characterized by a threshold magnetic field @xmath20 gev@xmath12 , above which the dynamics of the fermions is solely dominated by lll . in this regime ,",
    "the constituent quark mass monotonically increases with increasing @xmath2 as a consequence of mc . in the regime",
    "@xmath21 gev@xmath12 , however , the @xmath2 dependence of the condensate exhibits dhva oscillations , which occur whenever landau levels pass the quark fermi level .",
    "thus , because of these oscillations in the regime of @xmath22 , at a fixed temperature and for both vanishing and nonvanishing chemical potential , the chiral condensate exhibits two different behaviors : in some regimes , it increases with increasing @xmath2 , this is related to the phenomenon of mc .",
    "but , in some other regimes , it decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this is related to the phenomenon of imc .    in @xcite",
    ", we have also studied the effect of external magnetic fields on @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath0@xmath2 and @xmath1@xmath2 phase portraits of magnetized two - flavor njl model .",
    "we have shown that , as a consequence of the background magnetic fields , second order chiral phase transitions turn into first order ones , and , in the regime above @xmath20 gev@xmath12 , for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the critical temperature @xmath23 and chemical potential @xmath24 of @xmath17sb , monotonically increase with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this has been supposed to be an indication of the phenomenon of mc , which is mainly a lll dominated effect . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown , that in the regime of weak magnetic fields , the aforementioned dhva oscillations , lead again to two different behaviors of @xmath23 and @xmath24 as a function of @xmath2 : in some regimes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 increase with increasing @xmath2 , because of mc . in some other regimes",
    ", however , as a result of imc , @xmath23 and @xmath24 decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenon of reentrance of chiral ( color ) symmetry broken phases at certain fixed @xmath16 is also believed to be a consequence of dhva oscillations in the weak field regime @xcite .",
    "several other groups also investigate the effects of external magnetic fields on the phase diagram of hot qcd .",
    "these includes the groups working on lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 , zero @xmath1 and nonvanishing @xmath2 @xcite , or investigating the qcd phase diagram by making use of functional renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "many other groups elaborate different qcd - like models at finite @xmath16 , that exhibit @xmath17sb .",
    "the latter consists of , e.g. , njl - model @xcite , polyakov - linear-@xmath25 model @xcite , polyakov - njl model @xcite , polyakov - quark - meson model @xcite , njl model including axial chemical potential @xcite , ginzburg - landau model @xcite , charged scalar model with spontaneous @xmath17sb @xcite , njl model with dynamical amm generation @xcite .",
    "let us notice that the interest on this subject grows up after the still not fully comprehended lattice results by bali et al . in @xcite .",
    "they reported an unprecedented decrease of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath2 within an ab initio lattice qcd simulation , and declared this as a signature of imc in this framework .",
    "the physical explanation of the phenomenon of imc is , in particular , still under investigation : in @xcite , the interaction of the magnetic field with the sea quarks leading to a backreaction of the polyakov loop , and in @xcite the magnetic inhibition because of neutral meson fluctuations are made responsible for imc . in @xcite , it is explained how imc is induced by sphalerons .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the running of the corresponding coupling constants to the considered models , and therefore their @xmath2 dependence are taken into account , and it is shown how the lattice results on the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath23 in @xcite can be successfully reproduced .    in a parallel development , the competition between mass and @xmath2 contributions to qcd pressure",
    "is considered up to two - loop radiative corrections in @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the deviation of the land @xmath26-factor from @xmath27 , which is of about @xmath28 , may produce sizable corrections to the qcd pressure .",
    "this affects the energy of the lll by turning the mass into @xmath29 . for the relevant @xmath30 gev@xmath12",
    ", the correction will be in the mev range .",
    "it may thus compete with @xmath31 , and can not be ignored in quantitative studies @xcite .",
    "the effect of dynamically generated amm of fermions on the phase diagram of a magnetized one - flavor njl model is recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "here , inspired by the results presented in @xcite , a nonperturbative mechanism for the generation of the quark amm is introduced . to this purpose",
    ", a one - flavor njl lagrangian density including an appropriate tensor channel is used .",
    "it is in particular shown , that in the subcritical regime of the njl coupling , where the phenomenon of mc is solely responsible for @xmath17sb , two independent condensates emerge in the lll dominant regime .",
    "they correspond to the dynamical mass and the amm of quarks .",
    "the fact that the dynamical generation of amm is mainly a lll effect suggests that the schwinger linear - in-@xmath3 ansatz @xcite for the quark amm is not appropriate for massless fermions .",
    "this is argued to be in sharp contrast to theories with massive fermions , where a the schwinger ansatz is allowed in the limit of weak magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the critical temperature of the second order phase transition of @xmath17sb is determined in a lll approximation , and it is shown that the generation of the quark amm increases @xmath23 as a function of @xmath2 , and therefore it can not be responsible for the phenomenon of imc . in @xcite , however , following the aforementioned proposal of @xmath2 dependent coupling constant , the effect of running coupling constant of the one - flavor njl model on @xmath23 is studied .",
    "it is shown , that in the regime of strong magnetic fields , characterized by @xmath32 , the coupling constant of the model becomes anisotropic , and only the coupling parallel to the direction of the background magnetic field receives contributions from quarks in a lll approximation .",
    "interestingly , as a result of a certain antiscreening arising from the these quarks , this coupling decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on this specific coupling leads to the desired phenomenon of imc in the strong magnetic field limit .    in the present paper , motivated by the above intriguing developments",
    ", we will consider the quark amm in the one - loop effective potential of a magnetized two - flavor njl model at finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , and similar to the method used in @xcite , we will induce the quark amm by an additional term @xmath33 in the original lagrangian of the model , including massive quarks .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 , proportional to the bohr magneton @xmath35 , will then be identified with the quark amm .",

    "moreover , @xmath49 is related to the deviation of the land @xmath26-factor from @xmath27 .",
    "the above additional term @xmath50 is equivalent to the linear - in-@xmath3 ansatz by schwinger @xmath51 for @xmath50 , with the nonperturbative ( effective ) bohr magneton @xcite @xmath52 .",
    "let us notice , that in the one - loop level , @xmath49 is proportional to the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath53 .",
    "perturbatively , it receives radiative corrections from the vertex function of quarks and the background photon field . in the framework of constituent quark model @xcite , it appears in the ratio @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the constituent ( effective ) quark mass .",

    "let us consider a system including up and down quarks in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xmath373 .",
    "the spin magnetic moment @xmath374 of this system is given by @xmath375 here , @xmath376 is the land @xmath26-factor , with @xmath377 denoting its anomalous contribution . in our two - flavor njl model @xmath164 and @xmath378",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath57 in the spinor space are therefore given by @xmath390 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "using this expression , we can define the following positive ratio @xmath391 which turns out to be a phenomenologically relevant quantity @xcite . here , @xmath392 gev the proton mass , and @xmath56 the nuclear magneton , whose phenomenological values are fixed by experiments . using at this stage , @xmath393 for the magnetic moment of proton ( neutron ) @xmath394 ( @xmath395 ) , and their relationship to the magnetic moment of up and down quarks , @xmath396 and @xmath397 , @xmath398",
