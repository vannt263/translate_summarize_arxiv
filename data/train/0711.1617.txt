    "eclipsing binary stars ( ebs ) are important for astrophysical research in many ways .",
    "they may be used to obtain accurate estimates of star masses and radii ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "precise determination of stellar parameters can in turn be used to put theories of stellar structure and evolution to a stringent test by comparing measured parameters with theoretical predictions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "ebs may also be used for distance determination and this use goes back several decades ; its history is reviewed by @xcite .",
    "since @xcite used an estimate of the parallax to @xmath2 aurig  to infer the surface brightness of both its components , it has been known that a good photometric light curve plus a double line spectroscopic orbit admits a simple geometric relationship between the surface brightnesses of the stars and the distance to the eb ; @xcite however had no way at the time to make the reverse `` surface brightness to distance '' inference and his paper does no mention this possibility .",
    "after @xcite , other early papers @xcite used parallaxes obtained independently to estimate surface brightnesses , but , as remarked by @xcite , these pioneers surely knew of the potential of this technique to estimate distances .",
    "modern analyses of ebs have usually focussed on this technique ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the method affords high precision due to its purely geometrical nature and has been applied by a number of authors to determine the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) using hv2274 @xcite , hv982 @xcite , eros 1044 @xcite and hv 5936 @xcite ; an attempt to use ebs to determine the distance to m31 is currently under way @xcite and the direct project is attempting to measure the distance to m31 and m33 via ebs and cepheids @xcite ; other recent examples include @xcite who present a sample of detached binaries in the lmc for distance determination and @xcite who present the first determination of the distance and properties of an eb in m31 ; @xcite presents a sample of ebs with total eclipses in the lmc suitable for spectroscopic studies . in general",
    "it is important that distances be determined using a large sample of ebs to minimize the impact of systematic errors .",
    "a recent collection of references on extragalactic binaries can be found in @xcite .",
    "large - scale surveys to detect gravitational microlensing events have identified and collected light curves for large numbers of variable stars in the bulge of the milky way and in the magellanic clouds .",
    "eclipsing binary stars comprise a significant fraction of these collections .",
    "the macho collaboration has presented a sample of 611 ebs in the lmc with preliminary analyses of their orbits @xcite .",
    "a catalogue of @xmath3 ebs in the lmc found in the macho database has been just published by @xcite ; this catalogue was compiled by analyzing a list of @xmath4 stars classified as possible ebs in the macho database ; a cross correlation between these @xmath4 stars and our sample finds just @xmath5 matches , thus at least about @xmath6 ebs in our catalogue are new identifications .",
    "the @xmath4 classified as possible ebs were found in regions of parameter space such as color , magnitude , and period , where one does not expect to find pulsating variables and therefore the detected variability of these stars was _ tentatively _ ascribed to eclipses .",
    "regions where pulsating variables could exist were not considered while making this preliminary classification and ebs there were therefore not included in the list . in our search we did not rely primarily on cuts in parameter space and and we did not exclude a priori regions of this space where pulsating variables are present ; therefore we were able to classify many ebs in these regions , that were not included in the preliminary classification .",
    "the ogle collaboration ] has introduced a sample of @xmath7 ebs in the lmc @xcite and of @xmath8 ebs in the small magellanic cloud ( smc : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "both samples were selected from their catalogue of variable stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite compiled from observations taken during the second part of the project ( ogle ii : * ? ? ? * ) and reduced via difference image analysis ( dia : * ? ? ? * ) . an earlier sample of @xmath9 ebs in the bar of the lmc was presented by the eros collaboration@xcite .",
    "other large variable star data sets are being produced by surveys not specifically designed to detect gravitational microlensing , such as the all sky automated survey ( asas : * ? ? ?",
    "]    the availability of large samples of ebs ( and the even larger ones that can be found by future surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst ) can have an important impact on stellar astrophysics .",
    "this impact can arise in two qualitatively different approaches .",
    "first , a large catalogue allows the discerning researcher to select carefully a few ebs for detailed follow - up study ; the distance estimation described above is an example of this .",
    "second , statistical analyses of an entire population become possible when a large collection is assembled ; such analyses of ebs have not previously been possible . to fulfill this promise there are challenges to overcome , including finding ebs in large data sets and automating their analysis . with regard to the first task , the _ discovery _ problem is complicated by the fact that ebs do not have clear relationships between their parameters ( period , luminosity , colors ) as do the major classes of pulsating variables .",
    "this makes it difficult to find them via simple and well understood cuts in parameter space .",
    "the first step toward automated discovery is thus to have a large sample of data on which to experiment with search techniques .",
    "this non - trivial exercise in mining large data sets can be useful for future surveys that are not necessarily aimed at binary star research .",
    "an example is given by @xcite and @xcite who employ an artificial neural network to identify ebs in the ogle - ii lmc and smc samples , but more needs to be done .",
    "with regard to _ analysis _ of ebs , the traditional approach has been to carefully analyze individual systems with the help of dedicated computer codes such as the wilson - devinney code ( wd : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this becomes impracticable when many thousands of stars are involved and an automated approach is required .",
    "the light curves in a previous sample of 1459 ebs in the smc found by ogle - ii @xcite were systematically solved by @xcite using an automated version of the wd code ; the asas collaboration has developed an automated classification algorithm for variable stars based on fourier decomposition @xcite ; @xcite found and analyzed 10000 bulge ebs from ogle - ii using debil ] , an eb analysis code that allows automated solutions of large eb data sets and works best for detached ebs ; a genetic algorithm based approach to finding good initial parameters for wd is described in @xcite .",
    "this paper is the first of a series of papers aimed at describing the eb samples in the macho database and is organized as follows : section [ sec : sample ] introduces the lmc and smc samples ; section [ sec : diagrams ] describes the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and the color period diagram , pointing out significant features in them , section [ sec : comparison ] compares the lmc and smc samples , section [ sec : crossogle ] describes the results of the cross correlation with the ogle lmc and smc samples , and section [ sec : online ] reports where and in what form the data presented in the paper can be accessed on line .",
    "the macho project was an astronomical survey whose primary aim was to detect gravitational microlensing events of background sources by compact objects in the halo of the milky way .",
    "the gravitational background sources were located in the lmc , smc and the bulge of the milky way ; more details on the detection of microlensing events can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "observations were carried out from july 1992 to december 1999 with the dedicated @xmath10 telescope of mount stromlo , australia , using a @xmath11 mosaic of @xmath12 ccd in two bandpasses simultaneously .",
    "these are called macho  blue \" , hereafter indicated with @xmath13 , with a bandpass of @xmath14 and macho  red \" , hereafter indicated with @xmath15 , with a bandpass of @xmath16 ; these widths are between the half - response points as estimated from figure @xmath17 of @xcite . the bandpasses and the transformations to standard johnson @xmath18 and cousins",
    "@xmath19 bands are described in detail in @xcite ; see in particular their figure @xmath17 for the instrumental throughput of the two macho bands .",
    "each macho object is identified by its field number ( @xmath20 for the lmc , @xmath21 for the smc ) , its tile number ( which can overlap more than one field ) , and its sequence number in the tile .",
    "these form the so called macho field.tile.sequence ( fts ) , which is used in this paper to label ebs .",
    "note that , since some overlap exists between fields , one star may have two or more fts identifiers .",
    "the lmc sample we present comprises @xmath0 ebs selected by a variety of methods which we describe in this section ; the sample includes the 611 ebs described in @xcite .",
    "the lmc magnitudes quoted in this paper have been obtained by using the following transformation : @xmath22 from now on we will use the symbols @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23 to refer to standard magnitudes obtained from @xmath13 and @xmath15 via eq .",
    "[ eq : machocal ] for the lmc and eq .",
    "[ eq : smcmachocal ] for the smc , and _ not corrected for reddening _ ; we will also use @xmath13 and @xmath15 to indicate instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the observations number in several hundreds in both bandpasses for most light curves ; figure [ fig : pointhist ] shows histograms of the number of light curve points of the ebs in both bands ; the @xmath13 band has on average more observations than the @xmath15 band because one half of one of the red ccds was out of commission during part of the project .",
    "the central fields of the lmc were observed more often and the periphery less often as shown by the three peaks in the distribution where the first peak corresponds to the lmc periphery and the other two correspond to the center .",
    "this section describes the techniques employed to identify ebs both in the lmc and in the smc ; the results we quote are relative to the lmc . from now on we will always use the term _ unfolded light curve _ to indicate a set of time ordered observations and will reserve the term _ light curve _ to indicate a set of time ordered observations _ folded _ ( or _ phased _ ) around a period , omitting for brevity the adjectives `` folded '' and `` phased '' ; we will also use the terms eb , system , and object interchangeably .",
    "all sources in the survey were subjected to a test for variability @xcite and a large number of variable sources were identified @xcite .",
    "this first test starts by first eliminating the @xmath24 most extreme photometric data points ; the resulting unfolded light curve is fitted to constant brightness and its @xmath25/dof is calculated .",
    "the elimination of the most extreme points is expected to reduce the influence of noise and yield a good fit for a constant source , but not for a truly variable one .",
    "we consider the source variable if the @xmath25/dof thus computed can occur by chance with probability @xmath26 or less .",
    "sources that were flagged for variability were tested for periodicity .",
    "periods were found using the supersmoother algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* first published by @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm folds the unfolded light curve around trial periods and selects those periods in which the smoothed light curve matches the data best in a statistical sense ; we have selected the best 15 possible periods ranked by the smoothness of the light curve .",
    "periods were found separately for the red and blue unfolded light curves . the period selected as the best one by the program turned out to be `` correct '' in @xmath27 of the ebs for at least one band ; for @xmath28 of the ebs the second best period turned out to be correct for at least one band and only for @xmath29 of the ebs did the procedure fail to find a good period . in these cases",
    "`` correctness '' was determined by direct visual inspection .",

    "first when one eclipse ( the secondary ) is very shallow , supersmoother may not recognize it and yield a period twice the correct one .",
    "second , when the two eclipses have nearly equal depth supersmoother may confuse the secondary and the primary eclipses yielding a period half the correct one .",
    "the first failure happened , for one or both bands , in about @xmath36 of ebs , whereas the second happened in about @xmath35 of ebs .",
    "these cases are easy to correct upon visual inspection . for",
    "@xmath43 ebs supersmoother gave a period which was some other multiple of the correct one for at least one band ; these were fixed upon visual inspection . for the remaining ebs we tried folding the light curves around the other periods selected by supersmoother and managed to identify the correct period for most of them . in @xmath44 cases in which there were ogle - ii counterparts we adopted ogle periods since , though differing in some cases by less than @xmath26 from the periods found by supersmoother , they gave a much better light curve .",
    "we found @xmath45 stars in which the secondary eclipse was not evident , either because it was shallow or because the light curve was noisy , but with an ogle - ii counterpart in which it was clearly visible ; these stars have not been included in the catalogue .",
    "the periods in the two bands differ on average by @xmath46 .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ tab : period ] .",
    "the search for variable objects in the lmc gave @xmath47 objects of which @xmath48 were found to be periodic .",
    "to find ebs in this sample we considered a variety of properties of light curves .",
    "the techniques we employed are :    1 .",
    "look at the number of photometric excursions ( `` dips '' ) in the light curve .",
    "an eb is expected to show two `` dips '' in an entire period corresponding to the two eclipses as opposed to a cepheid or an rrlyr  star for which only one is expected .",
    "the number of photometric excursions was calculated by supersmoother by counting the number of times the smoothed light curve crosses the mean : we selected stars with two excursions in both bands .",
    "we additionally imposed a cut on light curve amplitudes : calling @xmath49 and @xmath50 the amplitudes of the blue and red light curves respectively , as computed by supersmoother , we imposed @xmath51 .",
    "this amplitude cut was imposed to help in eliminating rrlyrs from the sample , since , considering a population of several thousands probable rrlyrs found in the macho database , we found that , on average , @xmath52 ; imposing a cut @xmath51 should therefore filter out many rrlyr . in our sample",
    "just @xmath53 ebs ( @xmath54 ) pass this cut ; we then removed the amplitude cut and look at the number of photometric excursions alone we found that @xmath55 ebs ( @xmath56 ) pass this relaxed cut .",
    "2 .   look at the ratio of number of points five standard deviations _ away _",
    "( @xmath57 ) from the median to the number of points five standard deviations _ below _ the median ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this ratio is expected to be @xmath59 for a typical single variable star . for an eb",
    "we expect this ratio to approach @xmath60 as the signal to noise in the photometry increases , as most `` outlier '' points are due to eclipses .",
    "we imposed a cut @xmath61 in both bands and found that @xmath62 ebs pass it ( @xmath63 ) , whereas for the overall variable star dataset the figure is @xmath64 out of @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   use a decision tree .",
    "we applied the decision tree program described in @xcite , which was run on all the variable objects on the catalogue and gave for each the probability that it was an eb , an rrlyr , a cepheid , a long period variable or an unknown object . in all @xmath67 objects",
    "were found most likely by the decision tree to be ebs but only @xmath68 were found to be real on visual inspection and included in the sample .",
    "4 .   use a similarity technique .",
    "we finally tested the sample with a technique described in @xcite aimed at finding `` outliers '' in large data sets of variable star light curves .",
    "the technique aims at finding objects whose light curves are most dissimilar , in a statistical sense , from an `` average '' light curve built out of all the light curve in the data set .",
    "this is accomplished by looking at all the pairs of light curves to find their mutual similarity as defined in @xcite and , for each light curve , by then combining these measures , to find its overall similarity to the rest of the sample .",
    "light curves with low measure of similarity are flagged as outliers .",
    "this approach was useful in finding misfolded lightcurves since it found many objects for which the period for one band gave a badly folded light curve but the period for the other band gave a good folding .",
    "this happened for @xmath69 ebs , despite these periods differing on average by just @xmath70 ; in this case we selected the period that gave the good light curve for both bands .    since all the techniques we used give some false positives , each candidate was also visually inspected before inclusion in the sample",
    "; we paid closer attention to those stars which could more easily be classified as ebs without being so , like ellipsoidal variables ( see subsection [ subsec : ell ] ) and cepheids and rrlyr  mistakenly folded around a period twice their real one .",

    "our search gave @xmath88 objects observed in more than one field : these duplicates have different macho field numbers , but typically the same tile number .",
    "in this case we summed the numbers of observations in both bands for each field and chose the one which had the highest total number of observations : the object is identified by that corresponding fts only .",
    "figure [ fig : perhist ] shows a logarithmic histogram of the period distribution .",
    "note that the periods range from a fraction of a day to several hundreds of days .",
    "figure [ fig : maghist ] shows a histogram of the distribution of median @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that the magnitudes range in values from @xmath89 to @xmath90 both in @xmath18 and @xmath19 with a peak around @xmath91 .",
    "the average photometric error for the lmc is @xmath92 in both instrumental bands ; the average error for a light curve as a function of median relative magnitude is in standard magnitudes is shown in figure [ fig : magerr ] .",
    "for the lmc sample we estimated the distribution the root mean square ( rms ) of the residuals @xmath93 of the observations around a theoretical light curve as a function of median relative magnitude where @xmath94 is the value of the observed magnitude orbital phase @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the theoretical value at the same phase .",
    "theoretical values were obtained by fitting the light curves using the jktebop ] code @xcite .",
    "the jktebop code is based on the ebop code @xcite , which implements the model by @xcite with some modifications ; jktebop in turn adds several modifications and extensions to the original ebop code that make it easier to use , especially when fitting a large number of light curves . before fitting we eliminated outlying points by taking averages of all points in boxes containing from @xmath97 to @xmath98 points along a light curve and discarding the points more than @xmath79 standard deviations away from these averages .",
    "we obtained starting values for the model parameters by running the debil code @xcite and using the values it computed ; the limb darkening values for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands were taken from @xcite .",
    "we fixed the ratio of the masses , @xmath99 , to @xmath17 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 and did the fit in each case taking in the end the best result .",
    "finally we selected light curves with @xmath102 to show in figure [ fig : magrms ] .",
    "out of @xmath103 ebs in the lmc the program converged in @xmath104 cases in the @xmath19 band and in @xmath105 cases in the @xmath18 band ; we found @xmath106 fits with @xmath102 in the @xmath19 band and @xmath107 in the @xmath18 band .",
    "we point out that those fits were made only with the aim of obtaining a good theoretical light curve for as many observed light curves as possible in a fast and automated manner , so that a residuals distribution could be calculated .",
    "in particular we did _ not _ attempt to accurately determine astrophysical parameters for our ebs .",
    "this is also the reason why we discarded points at just @xmath79 standard deviations away from the moving averages , which could result in eliminating potentially interesting information for some ebs ; such objects are obviously deserving of more in depth study which we did not attempt here .",
    "while in general our fits were good in the case of largely separated , undistorted systems , they were often bad for close , strongly distorted ones , which is to be expected since jktebop is not meant to be used for such systems ; also in several cases our fits were bad because the scatter of the observed values was larger than the observational errors , which suggests that other physical phenomena , such as pulsation of one or both components , are present .",
    "the rms distributions of the residuals vs. median magnitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are shown in figure [ fig : magrms ] .",
    "figures [ fig : lcs1 ] , [ fig : lcs2 ] , [ fig : lcs3 ] , [ fig : lcs4 ] , [ fig : lcs5 ] , and [ fig : lcs6 ] show some examples of light curves .",
    "the panels on the left show the original light curves , those on the right show the light curves with the outlying points removed , the error bars , the theoretical light curves from the fit and the residuals the ebs shown are meant to be representative of the sample , this is why some examples of bad fits are included .",
    "comparing the panels on the left with the panels on the right for these figures gives an idea of the effect of removing outlying points .",
    "in particular the figures suggest that for those objects with good fits the procedure resulted in the elimination of truly outlying points ; these ebs are mostly detached with undistorted components . for objects with bad fits , which mostly comprise ebs with close and strongly distorted components ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "for example the system labelled 1.3442.172 shown in figure [ fig : lcs2 ] exhibits some points in the @xmath19 band , at secondary eclipse around phase @xmath108 , that run almost parallel to the main light curve but at a higher magnitude .",
    "such points may or may not be physically significant ; some of these are removed by our procedure , but the fit is nevertheless bad .",
    "the systems labelled 1.3804.164 in figure [ fig : lcs4 ] and 1.4055.98 in figure [ fig : lcs5 ] show a large and step - like scatter band , the reason of which is , we think , intrinsic variability of the secondary component , as suggested by the fact that the band becomes much narrower at primary eclipse but not at secondary eclipse ; this interpretation is also suggested by the fact that the residuals show an oscillating behavior as a function of phase . in both 1.4055.98 and 36.5943.658 in figure [ fig : lcs6 ] the scatter band is much larger than the observational error which explains their bad fits .",
    "these examples show that the samples contain many ebs which could be deserving of more careful study which we did not attempt here .",
    "the properties of these ebs are summarized in table [ tab : lcs ] ; of the @xmath109 ebs shown @xmath110 have two photometric excursions in both bands and @xmath111 , @xmath112 are found by the decision tree , @xmath113 have @xmath61 , and @xmath79 have a counterpart in the ogle - ii sample : 1.3442.172 ( counterpart ogle050149.20 - 691945.5 in field lmc@xmath114sc15 ) and 1.4055.98 ( counterpart ogle050542.06 - 684732.8 in field lmc@xmath114sc13 ) .",

    "ellipsoidal variability occurs in a close binary system when one ( or both ) component(s ) is ( are ) tidally distorted by the companion .",
    "if the binary system is detached , as most systems in our samples are , the distorted stars assume the asymmetric , egg like shape of the roche equipotential surface whereas in the case of contact system the shape of the common equipotential surface is more reminiscent of a dumbbell .",
    "the light curve of an ellipsoidal variable system reveals a continuously varying profile , with two maxima and two minima per period , with the minima often having different depth , whereas the maxima are usually equal .",
    "the main reason for this variability is that , as the stars rotate , their projected areas on the sky vary , reaching a maximum at the two quadratures and a minimum at the two conjunctions ; the measured flux thus varies in the same way during a period .",
    "more information on ellipsoidal variables can be found in @xcite a large sample of ellipsoidal variables in the lmc has been released by the ogle collaboration @xcite ; an analysis of ellipsoidal variables found in the macho database has been published by @xcite .",
    "a binary system can present both eclipses and ellipsoidal variability but in many cases it may not be possible to clearly recognize an eclipse from visual inspection ; this poses a problem for the compilation of eb catalogues since the light curves of ebs and non eclipsing ellipsoidal variables can be easily confused .",

    "we employ the term _ young star region _ to describe the main feature on the left part of the cmd , rather than main sequence because our sample contains some bright and short lived stars that may not be burning hydrogen in their core while still being on the blue part of the cmd ; likewise we employ the term _ evolved star region _ to indicate the feature on the red part of the cmd .",
    "we define the young star region as @xmath129 and the evolved star region as @xmath130 : with these definitions we find @xmath131 ebs in the young star region and @xmath132 ebs in the evolved star region .",
    "we used a simple cut to separate the young star region from the evolved star region rather than a more precise one because our cut can be easily seen both in the cmd and in the color period diagrams .",
    "an interesting feature of the cmd is the lack of a clear gap between the young star region and the evolved star region ; there is instead a fairly continuous transition , with a higher number of systems filling the hertzsprung gap that would be expected from cmds of single stars .",
    "this may indicate that these systems are composed of a more massive and hence more evolved and redder star and a less massive , less evolved , bluer one .",
    "the color period diagram is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] ; this diagram clearly shows the young ebs with periods @xmath133 and a second population ( @xmath134 objects ) of long period , evolved ebs with periods @xmath135 and @xmath130 .",
    "several interesting features emerge in figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] : there is a paucity of long period objects on the young star region of the cmd , and a corresponding lack of short period objects with very red colors .",
    "furthermore , the red ( @xmath130 ) population shows a positive correlation between period and color .",
    "there are virtually no long period , blue objects or short period , red objects in this group .",
    "in contrast , the young star region shows no such correlation .",
    "this structure in the color period diagram is a consequence of ( i ) kepler s third law , ( ii ) the probability that an eb is favorably oriented in space to allow eclipses to be detected ( @xmath136 ) where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the radii of the primary and secondary stars , respectively and @xmath139 is the semi major axis , and ( iii ) that objects usually evolve in this diagram at constant period , from blue to red .",
    "long period binary stars have large semi - major axes . when both stars are on the young star region , their relatively small radii yield a relatively low probability that they will eclipse when seen from our vantage point .",
    "when one of the pair evolves away from the young star region , one of these radii ( typically @xmath137 ) will increase .",
    "the consequence of this is an increase in the probability that eclipses will be detected .",
    "this accounts for the presence of red , long period stars and the absence of corresponding young progenitors .",
    "the situation is different for short period systems .",
    "these are relatively likely to be detected because of their small semi - major axes , and are prominent on the blue side .",
    "as one of these stars evolves and expands rapidly , it may engulf the companion and enter a stage of _ common envelope evolution _ in which the expanding star overflows the _ second _ lagrangian point @xmath140 @xcite ; leading to the disappearance of eclipses .",
    "common envelope system differ from contact binaries @xcite in which two young stars overflow their first lagrangian point ( @xmath141 ) and their roche equipotential surface assumes a dumbbell shape .",
    "contact systems usually show ellipsoidal variation and , if the orbital inclination is large enough , also eclipses ; ebs of the w uma type belong to this category . @xcite and @xcite provide more information on common envelope binaries .",
    "the correlation between period and color among red objects reflects the general correlation between radius and color for the evolved partner .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] reveals a population of @xmath142 ebs with low periods ( @xmath143 ) and high color ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "these objects are probably foreground galactic ebs composed of late type stars .",
    "this interpretation is suggested by several factors .",
    "first , due to the large angular extent of the lmc , there is foreground contamination in the lmc macho fields @xcite ; in particular the feature marked `` h '' in the cmd of their figure @xmath17 indicates foreground galactic disk stars and is centered at @xmath145 as is our presumptive foreground population .",
    "second , both the short period of these ebs , and the shape of their light curves which are either detached or mildly distorted , strongly suggests that the stars making up this population are small , late type stars ; this is further borne out by their color , again typical of a solar like star ; finally , the cmd of this population , shown in figure [ fig : cmdforeground ] clearly shows what appears to be a turnoff feature at @xmath146 , with few evolved objects ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the overall shape of this population in the color period diagram shows , on a smaller scale , the same features of the lmc diagram ; a main sequence is clearly visible in figure [ fig : cmdforeground ] and the evolved ebs show the same color period correlation of their lmc counterparts in figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] .",
    "figure [ fig : smccmd ] shows the cmd for @xmath148 ebs in the smc sample out of the @xmath1 in the sample ; one eb which has valid data only in the @xmath15 band is not shown because it was not possible to determine the standard magnitudes via eq .",
    "[ eq : smcmachocal ] .",
    "the general remarks made for the lmc cmd apply here as well and we used a reddening vector with the same inclination as the lmc .",
    "the figure clearly shows the young star region which is composed of @xmath149 ebs ( @xmath150 ) whereas there are just @xmath151 evolved ebs .",
    "we estimate the smc reddening from @xcite ; from their figure @xmath152 we infer a mean @xmath153 for their hotter smc population , relevant to our sample which is composed mostly of early type hot stars on the young star region .",
    "we use the same reddening vector as the lmc , @xmath125 , and find a mean @xmath154 .",
    "the color period diagram is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] ; the general considerations made for the lmc color period diagram apply here as well .",
    "the diagram shows @xmath113 ebs with low period ( @xmath155 ) and red color ( @xmath156 ) which are probably foreground objects . the much smaller number of foreground objects in the smc is probably due both to its smaller angular size and to its higher galactic latitude ( @xmath157 compared to @xmath158 for the lmc ) .",
    "we can further test the hypothesis that these two short period , red populations in the lmc and smc are due to foreground objects by comparing the ratio of their numbers to the ratio of the areas of the lmc and smc , which we can estimate from figures [ fig : pos ] and [ fig : smcpos ] ; if these objects are indeed foreground these two ratios should be roughly equal . from the figures we can estimate the sky area of the lmc as @xmath159 and the sky area of the smc as @xmath160 ; their ratio is thus similar to the ratio of the numbers of ebs in the two populations as expected .",
    "although the basic features of the cmd and the color period diagram are the same for lmc and smc , there are some differences , shown by figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] and table [ tab : smcvslmc ] .",

    "we adopted a distance modulus of of @xmath176 for the smc @xcite and @xmath177 for the lmc @xcite .",
    "magnitudes and colors were dereddened using @xmath178 , @xmath179 for the lmc and @xmath180 , @xmath181 for the smc before subtracting the distance moduli .",
    "the empirical cumulative distribution functions ( ecdfs ) of these quantities are shown in figure [ fig : ecdf ] .",
    "a ks test confirms that the distributions of @xmath175 and @xmath174 are different at @xmath182 confidence level ; for the distributions of @xmath183 and @xmath184 the ks test gives a probability of @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively for them being different .",
    "the @xmath174 plot shows that ebs in the smc tend to be bluer , not surprising given that a higher percentage of objects belong to the young star cmd region in the smc than in the lmc .",
    "the period distributions show that the smc ebs have on average shorter periods , again not surprising given the much higher percentage of evolved systems in the lmc than in the smc and the fact that evolved systems have on average higher periods than the young systems ( as shown by the color period diagrams in figure [ fig : smcvslmc ] ) .",
    "the ebs in our samples have been cross correlated with the corresponding ogle - ii samples .",
    "stars in the samples were identified if their right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) differed by less than @xmath187 and if their periods differed by @xmath188 .",
    "we used a very large search radius to be conservative .",
    "the astrometric precision for both surveys is typically @xmath189 , but a few stars which had much larger differences in ra and/or dec turned out to be matches upon inspection of their periods : in particular we found in the lmc @xmath190 matches with a position difference bigger than @xmath191 and @xmath79 matches with a position difference bigger than @xmath192 .",
    "however most of the matches were within narrower radii : for the lmc roughly half of the matches ( @xmath193 out of @xmath194 ) were found within of @xmath195 , compatible with the astrometric precision of both macho and ogle surveys ; almost all of them ( @xmath196 ) were within @xmath197 .",
    "we tested the robustness of our method of finding matches by investigating the probability for two periodic objects with a period difference of @xmath188 to be within @xmath187 of each other . to do this",
    "we selected a random sample of @xmath198 objects out of the @xmath199 periodic ones found by macho in the lmc and we counted the frequency of pairs of objects with both periods from the red and the blue lightcurves ( as found by supersmoother ) differing by @xmath188 and positions within @xmath187 .",
    "most of the matches we found were due to the same object being observed in different tiles and only in one case did we find a possibly genuine match ; we thus conclude that the probability of two objects being erroneously classified as a match is @xmath200 and therefore our method of finding matches is robust .",
    "our search produced @xmath194 matches in the lmc .",
    "the macho and ogle - ii periods agree to high accuracy as shown in figure [ fig : crossper ] ; usually much better than the @xmath26 cut we imposed .",
    "histograms of position differences are shown by figure [ fig : diffposhist ] .",
    "both panels show the entire span of the differences ; the differences in right ascension range from @xmath201 to @xmath202 but the left panel shows this range multiplied by the cosine of the declination ( @xmath203 ) which gives a range from @xmath204 to @xmath205 .",
    "the sky coverage of the two surveys was different : ogle - ii , from which the sample was derived , covered about @xmath206 in the central region of the lmc whereas the sky coverage of macho was larger .",
    "figure [ fig : pos ] shows the positions of the ebs in both catalogues and figure [ fig : machofields ] shows the corresponding macho field number ; the fields at the center of the lmc are drawn with continuous lines , the ones at the periphery with dashed lines .      in view of the different sky coverage of the macho and ogle - ii surveys , it is interesting to analyze separately the stars in macho fields covering the center of the lmc ( which roughly correspond to the ogle - ii sky coverage ) and the stars in the macho fields at the periphery . figure .",
    "[ fig : machofields ] shows that the fields in the center are 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 , 47 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 and 82 .",

    "figure [ fig : cmdcenter ] shows the cmd and the color period diagram for the center and the periphery of the lmc respectively ; figure [ fig : perhistcenter ] shows the histograms for the magnitudes , the color and the period .",
    "the figures reveal several differences between the two samples ; to check these we performed a ks test for @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath175 and found that at high confidence level ( @xmath182 ) the distributions are different .",
    "these differences are statistically significant but not large enough to be considered astrophysically important .",
    "in particular the difference in period distribution could be attributed to the lower sampling in the outer fields , making it less likely to detect the longer period ebs .",
    "the sampling might also be the cause of the periphery having a higher percentage of bright ebs , since these are easier to find with fewer epochs .",
    "we finally investigated why we did not find more matches with ogle - ii .",
    "the most important reason , we think , is the fact that the techniques employed in assembling the samples are different : the ogle team built their samples via neural networks @xcite .",
    "the two surveys have roughly comparable limiting magnitudes , @xmath209 ; nevertheless we checked how the performance of the two surveys varied with magnitude .",
    "we compared the distribution of the @xmath18 magnitudes for the @xmath207 ebs in the central region of the lmc in our sample with those of @xmath210 matches and the @xmath211 ebs from ogle - ii without macho counterparts ( these two numbers do not add up to @xmath7 , the size of the ogle - ii sample , because for some ebs the @xmath18 magnitude was not reported ) .",
    "the histograms of these three distributions are shown in figure [ fig : v_macho_and_ogle ] .",
    "the figure shows that ogle - ii ebs with macho counterparts , peaking at @xmath212 like the macho sample , are on average brighter than the ones without macho counterparts , which peak at @xmath213 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath18 distribution of ogle - ii ebs with macho counterparts much more closely resembles the macho @xmath18 distribution ; a ks test gives a probability of the two distributions being the same of @xmath214 .",
    "the distributions of macho @xmath18 and ogle - ii @xmath18 without macho counterparts , as well as those of these two ogle - ii populations are , on the other hand , shown to be different at @xmath182 confidence level .",
    "both distributions vanish at @xmath215 , showing that their limiting magnitudes are comparable .",
    "we then studied the distributions of the periods : figure [ fig : per_macho_and_ogle ] shows that the ogle - ii ebs without macho counterparts have on average longer periods than macho ebs in the center of the lmc and than ogle - ii ebs with a macho counterpart and the difference is statistically significant in both cases ; the period distributions of the macho eb of the lmc center and of the macho ogle - ii matches are statistically different as well .",
    "therefore , ogle - ii finds a higher proportion of fainter objects than macho and this does play a role in not finding an higher number of ogle - ii counterparts to our sample .",
    "we finally studied the distribution of the macho - ogle matches as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "we first counted the number of ogle - ii lmc ebs in the macho fields , finding @xmath216 of them , out of a total of @xmath7 ; of these @xmath216 ebs , @xmath194 were the matches described above and @xmath217 did not have a macho counterpart ( this last number is smaller than @xmath211 , the total number of ogle ebs without macho counterpart , because we are now only considering ogle ebs in macho fields ) .",
    "we then studied the distribution , as a function of @xmath18 , of the ogle ebs in the macho fields that both had and did not have a macho counterpart and for which the @xmath18 magnitude was reported : there were @xmath210 of the former and @xmath218 of the latter .",
    "we finally performed the inverse calculation , by first counting the number of macho lmc ebs in the ogle - ii fields and finding @xmath219 of them ; of these @xmath220 had an ogle - ii counterpart and @xmath221 did not ; we studied the distribution of both these populations as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "the ogle - ii field boundaries were estimated by taking the coordinates of the most extreme ebs in each ogle - ii field .",

    "lc ogle - ii lmc ebs & @xmath7 + ogle - ii lmc ebs in macho fields & @xmath216 + ogle - macho matches & @xmath194 + ogle - ii lmc ebs without macho counterpart & @xmath217 + ogle - macho matches with reported @xmath18 & @xmath210 + ogle - ii lmc ebs without macho counterpart with reported @xmath18 & @xmath218 + macho ebs in ogle fields & @xmath219 + macho ebs in ogle fields with ogle counterpart & @xmath220 + macho ebs in ogle fields without ogle counterpart & @xmath221 +    the distributions of both the ogle - ii ebs _ with _ macho counterpart and of the macho ebs _ with _ ogle - ii counterparts are shown in figure [ fig : v_matches ] ; the figure shows the fraction of matches in magnitude bins of @xmath222 ; the bin centers range from @xmath223 to @xmath224 .",
    "the error bars are estimated by assuming that the matches in each magnitude bin follow a binomial distribution with probability @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the number of matches in each magnitude bin and @xmath227 is the total number of ebs ; the error in the expected fraction of matches is then given by eq [ eq : errorbar ] ; in both distributions of figure .",
    "[ fig : v_matches ] the error bar for the brightest magnitude bin is not shown since in both cases there is only one match , rendering eq .",
    "[ eq : errorbar ] meaningless .",
    "the figure shows that the fraction of matches increases for brighter magnitudes as expected ; the fall at @xmath228 in the distribution of ogle matches is probably due to small number statistic as evidenced by the large error bar . @xmath229",
    "the same general considerations apply to the smc sample : the search , performed with the same criteria as the lmc , produced @xmath230 matches .",
    "figure [ fig : smccrossper ] shows the percentage difference of the macho and ogle - ii periods vs macho period for the matches ; figure [ fig : smcdiffposhist ] shows the histogram of the differences in ra and dec .",
    "unlike the lmc , the sky coverage of the two surveys was approximately the same .",
    "figure [ fig : smcpos ] shows the positions of the macho and ogle ebs on the sky .",
    "we again investigated why we did not find more matches with ogle - ii .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : smcpos ] it is evident that one of the reasons is the somewhat different sky coverage of the two surveys ( macho fields 207 , 208 and 211 are only partially covered by ogle ) , but we also looked for other possible explanations .",
    "again , the most likely explanation is the ways in which the samples were assembled , but we also considered the differences in the distributions of magnitudes and periods .",
    "as for the lmc , we compared the distribution of the @xmath18 magnitudes for the @xmath148 ebs in our sample which have a valid @xmath18 with those of @xmath231 matches and the @xmath232 ebs from ogle - ii without macho counterparts ( again these two numbers do not add up to @xmath8 , the size of the ogle - ii sample , because for some ebs the @xmath18 magnitude was not reported ) .",
    "the histograms of these three distributions are shown in figure [ fig : smcv_macho_and_ogle ] .",
    "the figure shows that ogle - ii ebs with macho counterparts , peaking at @xmath233 like the macho sample , are on average brighter than the ones without macho counterparts , which is more spread out and roughly constant between @xmath234 . a ks test shows that these three distributions are different at @xmath235 confidence level .",
    "the behavior at high magnitudes is different for macho and ogle - ii : the figure suggests a magnitude limit of @xmath120 for macho and @xmath236 for ogle - ii ; for @xmath237 macho finds many more ebs than ogle - ii .",
    "we then studied the distributions of the periods : figure [ fig : smcper_macho_and_ogle ] shows that ogle - ii ebs with macho counterparts have periods that cluster more in the @xmath238 range , as do the macho ebs and a ks test gives a probability @xmath239 for the two distribution to be the same . on the other hand ogle - ii ebs without macho counterparts",
    "have a larger spread of period values , with more objects having @xmath240 and with small `` bumps '' in the distributions at @xmath241 and @xmath242 and a ks test shows it to be different from both macho and ogle - ii macho matches at @xmath182 confidence level .",
    "the @xmath18 distributions of both the ogle - ii ebs without macho counterpart and of the macho ebs without ogle - ii counterparts are shown if figure [ fig : v_matches_smc ] ; the figure shows the fraction of matches in magnitude bins of @xmath222 with centers ranging from @xmath223 to @xmath243 ; the error bars are estimated again by eq .",
    "[ eq : errorbar ] .",
    "we conclude that differences in sky coverage and in techniques used in assembling the samples , as well as different magnitude limits and in general different behavior at high magnitude of the two surveys all play a role in not finding an higher number of ogle - ii counterparts to our sample ; the fact that the smc was less observed than the lmc by macho may also explain why we find fewer long period objects , while the fact that the exposure time for the smc was double that of the lmc @xcite may explain why we find many faint objects .",
    "the data presented in this paper can be accessed on line at the astronomical journal website and are mirrored at the harvard university initiative in innovative computing ( iic ) /time series center . at both sites the data consist of a summary table for each cloud and light curves for all the ebs in the samples .",
