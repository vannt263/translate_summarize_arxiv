    "meson related physics has always led to interesting findings in different ways .",
    "though mesons are strongly interacting objects composed of quark - antiquark ( @xmath16 ) pairs , the bonding of electrically charged mesons with nuclei leads to the formation of exotic atoms .",
    "for example , negatively charged pions or kaons could replace an electron in an outer orbital in a standard atom and get bound in the atom due to the coulomb interaction . after some transitions to lower states however , the meson comes within the range of the strong nuclear interaction and is absorbed on to the nucleus or lost in a nuclear reaction .",
    "thus a meson which in principle in free space could have undergone a weak decay gets bound by the electromagnetic interaction and vanishes by the strong interaction .",
    "there exists yet another possibility for the formation of bound states of mesons and nuclei and this is when the meson - nucleus strong interaction is attractive ( which may not necessarily be the case ) .",
    "the eta ( @xmath4 ) meson seems to satisfy this requirement .",
    "its interaction with the nucleon in the s - wave ( which proceeds through the formation of an n@xmath17(1535 ) nucleon resonance ) was found to be attractive @xcite and led to the prediction @xcite and early searches @xcite of unstable states of eta mesons and nuclei .",
    "the existence of unstable bound states of the strange @xmath18-meson and nuclei was also indicated in some recent experiments as a result of the @xmath19 @xmath20-wave interaction @xcite .",
    "additionally , the superposition of a large repulsive s - wave @xmath21-nucleus interaction at low pion momenta and an attractive coulomb interaction has been seen to give rise to deeply bound pion - nucleus bound states @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath4-meson with a nucleon near threshold is mainly determined by the @xmath22 , @xmath23 resonance n@xmath17(1535 ) , which is just 49 mev above the @xmath9 threshold and has a width @xmath24=150 mev , thus covering the whole low energy region of the @xmath9 interaction . as the @xmath22-resonance also decays to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels , the correct treatment of the @xmath9 interaction ,",
    "therefore , involves its coupling to all these channels .",
    "several such coupled channel calculations have been reported in literature @xcite .",
    "results of these calculations are fitted to the available data , and the @xmath9 scattering amplitude is obtained .",
    "however , as the fitted data do not include the elastic @xmath9 scattering data due to nonavailability of @xmath4 beams , such extracted @xmath9 scattering amplitudes and hence the @xmath9 scattering lengths , @xmath28 , have uncertainties .",
    "but one conclusion which seems definite in all the calculations is that the @xmath9 interaction is strong and attractive in the s - wave .",
    "when viewed as an elementary particle , the @xmath4-meson is quite similar to the @xmath29-meson , despite the @xmath4 being about four times heavier than the @xmath29 .",
    "both mesons are pseudoscalar , i.e. , @xmath30 , are charge neutral , have almost the same lifetime (  10@xmath31 sec ) and are the only mesons that have a high probability of pure radiative decay . structurally though , as they are the quantum states of @xmath32 , it is believed that due to the mass difference between the u and d quarks and their electromagnetic interaction , the @xmath33 and @xmath4 are not pure isotopic spin states .",
    "the physically observed @xmath29 and @xmath4 are , actually , the superposition of the pure isotopic spin t=0 and 1 quantum states . the value of the mixing angle of these two states obtained in @xcite from an analysis of the cross sections for the @xmath34h @xmath35/@xmath36he @xmath29 reactions is 0.006 @xmath370.005 radians .",
    "@xcite also discusses literature where the values vary between 0.01 to 0.034 radians .",
    "the @xmath4-meson is also known to mix with its heavier partner , @xmath38 .",
    "the isospin mixing structure of the @xmath29 and @xmath4 gets manifested as isospin symmetry breaking ( isb ) and charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) when these mesons come in contact with nucleons .",
    "though it is believed that most of the isb and csb effects observed in hadronic systems have the above origin , significant and directly observable isospin - violating effects may be seen in pion production at energies near the @xmath4 threshold via @xmath39 external mixing .",
    "such exploratory studies have been conducted experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "coming back to the @xmath9 interaction , its strong attractive nature opened up the possibility of the formation of @xmath4-nucleus quasibound states . the initial theoretical prediction around 1986 about the possible existence of unstable bound states of eta mesons and nuclei gave rise to experimental programs to hunt for the existence of eta - mesic states as well as eta meson production experiments aimed at studying the eta - nucleus interaction in the final states .",
    "the theoretical developments kept pace with the experiments . over the years",
    "more and more sophisticated models to understand the basic eta - nucleon interaction , the few body problem of eta mesons and light nuclei and the many body problem of eta mesons and heavy nuclei kept appearing . after about 25 years of investigations in this field , there has been a lot of progress and some evidence exists for the existence of such states .",
    "however , there is still no general agreement and no final word on the strength of the eta - nucleon and eta - nucleus interaction .",
    "though a detailed account of the various theoretical and experimental efforts will be given in the next sections of the article , at this point we mention a few of these works . for nuclei beyond few - nucleon systems ,",
    "calculations have mostly been done using an @xmath4-nucleus optical potential . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath4-mesic states were found from complex energy solutions of the momentum - space relativistic three - dimensional integral equation using different optical potentials . in this work , the binding energies and widths were found to strongly depend on the sub - threshold @xmath4-nucleon interaction .",
    "these calculations predicted unstable bound or quasibound states for nuclei with mass number greater than 10 . in another approach using optical potentials @xcite , the self energies of the @xmath4 meson in the nuclear medium evaluated for @xmath40c , @xmath41ca and @xmath42pb were used to find the widths of quasibound states of @xmath4 mesons and nuclei . in @xcite ,",
    "the energies and widths of several @xmath4-mesic nuclei were predicted by once again using self energies of the @xmath4 in the medium but evaluated using the technique of unitarized chiral perturbation theory .",
    "another approach that has been used is the qcd based quark - meson - coupling approach ( qmc ) , where the @xmath4-meson is embedded in the nuclear medium and couples to quarks and mixes with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 self energy obtained from such calculations was used in the local density approximation in the klein - gordon equation to obtain the complex energy solutions .",
    "this approach , apart from predicting the energies and widths of the quasibound states also showed the important role of @xmath43 mixing in understanding the @xmath9 scattering amplitude .    for few - nucleon systems , the existence of @xmath4 binding",
    "is mostly explored by calculating the poles in the scattering amplitude and the corresponding @xmath4-nucleus scattering lengths .",
    "the existence of quasibound states requires the real parts of the scattering lengths to be large and negative . in @xcite",
    "the author predicted a quasibound state in the @xmath44-@xmath45 coupled system and confirmed its existence through the existence of a pole and a remarkable enhancement of the @xmath46 elastic cross section .",
    "the state was predicted with a mass of 2430 mev and a width of 10 - 20 mev . in @xcite using faddeev equations and a certain choice of potentials for the binary sub - systems in it , the authors found at best the existence of a quasivirtual state only .",
    "other works involve the use of a multiple scattering formalism @xcite and calculations done within the finite rank approximation using few body equations @xcite to characterize @xmath4-mesic states of the deuteron , @xmath36h , @xmath36he and @xmath47he nuclei . these and other few body calculations will be discussed in detail in section 3 .",
    "the anticipated @xmath48-nucleus bound states should get reflected in a straight forward way in the measured eta producing nuclear cross sections .",
    "such observations have indeed been made in the proton induced @xmath4 production reactions where the measured amplitude on the deuteron target shows a sharp rise as one approaches the threshold @xcite of @xmath4 production . the @xmath4 @xmath36he ( or @xmath46 )",
    "scattering amplitude has been usually extracted from data by writing the cross section as a product of the plane wave result and an enhancement factor , which has been parametrized in terms of the scattering length @xcite .",
    "large values of the real part of the extracted scattering lengths from such analyses are normally taken as an indicator for the existence of bound states .",
    "this procedure of extracting the scattering lengths , however , ignores reference to any reaction mechanism for @xmath4 production and lacks a detailed treatment of the final state interaction . therefore ,",
    "while the extracted scattering lengths by this method may at best be indicative , their actual values may not be fully reliable for determining the bound states .",
    "a proper procedure should be to first analyze these data using a certain @xmath4 production mechanism @xcite and then incorporate in detail the final state interaction ( fsi ) as accurately as possible .",
    "once such a procedure , using the available @xmath9 transition matrix , reproduces the measured cross sections , one can then infer from them the resultant @xmath4-nucleus scattering amplitudes , which will have a certain in - built off - shell behaviour .",
    "these amplitudes can then be used to investigate the possibility of the existence of unstable bound states .",
    "based on this concept the present authors first carried out a systematic analysis of the @xmath4 producing nuclear reactions to obtain a reliable @xmath4-nucleus scattering amplitude which was then used to locate the unstable bound states in the @xmath4-deuteron , @xmath4-@xmath36he and @xmath4-@xmath47he systems @xcite .",
    "the states were located using wigner s time delay method which had earlier been successfully used to locate meson and baryon resonances @xcite .",
    "a modification of wigner s method was done in @xcite and an eta - mesic state in the @xmath4-@xmath36he system was found in agreement with experiments .",
    "as for the experimental status of eta mesic states , some measurements which give a positive indication of the existence of @xmath4-mesic states have been reported in literature .",
    "one such experiment was performed by the taps collaboration @xcite on the photo - production of @xmath4 on @xmath36he , namely , @xmath49he @xmath50 x , where one essentially sees the decay of a bound @xmath4 in @xmath36he through the @xmath22 resonance .",
    "the other one is a bit more recent measurement from cosy on the @xmath51al @xmath52he x reaction in a recoil free kinematic set - up @xcite , where one observes in coincidence with @xmath36he , the decay of a possible bound @xmath4-@xmath53 mg state , again , through the @xmath22 resonance .",
    "a detailed account of the experimental status will be given in section 3 .",
    "in addition to the above studies of eta - mesic quasibound states , large efforts have also gone in understanding the eta producing reactions which explore the @xmath4 production vertex in these reactions and the effect of the eta interaction with different nuclei in the final state . the elementary reaction @xmath54 has been studied extensively within boson exchange models which include the exchange of @xmath55 , @xmath4 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 mesons .",
    "the opinion regarding the role of these mesons seems to be however divided . in one of the first works @xcite and more recent ones @xcite , the @xmath56 meson was found to play a dominant role .",
    "however , measurements of the analyzing power for the @xmath58 @xmath59 reaction ( with @xmath60 indicating a polarized proton beam ) near threshold @xcite and theoretical calculations in @xcite up to 10 gev beam energy do not agree with a @xmath56 meson dominance .",
    "the production of @xmath4 mesons in other reactions such as the @xmath61 @xmath62he @xmath4 , @xmath61 @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65he @xmath4 has been studied @xcite within one- , two- and three - body exchange mechanisms proposed in @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of these works as well as those on the @xmath5li @xmath66 @xmath67be @xmath4 reaction @xcite and the available measurements @xcite will be given in section 4 .",
    "we note here in passing that though the three body mechanism where the large momentum transfer in the production of the massive @xmath4 meson is shared between nucleons seems to reproduce the threshold data very well , it fails to reproduce the forward peaks in the angular distributions at high energies and thus remains to be an open problem to be settled in future .",
    "this report is organized as follows . as the @xmath9 scattering amplitude plays a pivotal role in all the eta - nucleus studies , we begin by giving a comprehensive account on the present knowledge of the elementary amplitude and the procedures employed to obtain it . a large section after this",
    "is dedicated to present an exhaustive account of the experimental and theoretical searches for the existence of the exotic eta - mesic states .",
    "considering the vast amount of literature available , though we will try to provide a complete bibliography , the focus of these sections will be on a few theoretical works representative of each type of formalism .",
    "in addition to the studies of eta mesic quasibound states , huge efforts have also gone in understanding the eta producing reactions which explore the eta production vertex in these reactions and the effect of the eta interaction with other nuclei in the final state .",
    "the reaction mechanisms used for eta production are usually based on models similar to those used for other mesons such as the pions and kaons .",
    "hence after giving a brief description of all available mechanisms and their success in comparison with data , we shall review their relevance for the eta production reactions near threshold as well as at high energies in section 4 .",
    "since the objective of the eta producing reactions is to finally investigate the eta nucleus interaction in the final state , the next section naturally goes over to discuss the results obtained as compared to data . here",
    ", in section 5 , the focus will be on specific reactions , the theoretical estimates for them and their comparison with data .",
    "finally , after having surveyed most of the existing literature on theoretical predictions and experimental data , we will try to draw conclusions on the range of the strength of the eta nucleon and hence eta nucleus interaction .",
    "these conclusions should help in planning experiments for future investigations in this field .",
    "the most appropriate source of the @xmath4-nucleon scattering amplitude should , of course , be the elastic scattering data on it .",
    "however , such studies can not be pursued because @xmath48 beams are not available .",
    "the next appropriate way then is to obtain it from the @xmath4 production reactions like @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where this information appears in the final state through the interaction of the emerging @xmath48-meson with the recoiling nucleon .",
    "detailed experimental information on these reactions exists now as the pion and photon beams are in use over a wide range of energies .",
    "the database includes the total and the differential cross sections from threshold to high energies .",
    "it also includes some polarization measurements .",
    "the older of these data have been reviewed in @xcite , while the most recent ones are given in @xcite .",
    "plotted as a function of beam energy the total pion - nucleon cross section shows a sharp growth above the @xmath48-threshold , signalling the opening of the @xmath9 channel .",
    "the sharp rise in the pion - induced eta cross section is attributed to the broad nucleon resonance , @xmath70 , which is very close to the @xmath48-production threshold at @xmath71 @xmath72 1487 mev .",
    "it is strongly coupled to both the pion and the eta - meson in the s - wave .",
    "the other resonances near the @xmath48-threshold are the @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , the coupling of @xmath74 to the @xmath9 channel is very weak ( branching ratio @xmath75=0.0023@xmath760.0004 ) and that of the subthreshold but very broad @xmath73 undetermined . with increasing energy ,",
    "the @xmath74 shows up through an interference with the dominant @xmath70 .    near threshold",
    "the @xmath4-nucleon scattering thus consists of elastic scattering , @xmath77 and the reactive @xmath78 channel .",
    "it also has another reactive channel @xmath79 ( arising from the @xmath80 and @xmath81 couplings ) , but the cross section for it is very small . the @xmath48-nucleon scattering length @xmath28 , which is the parametrization of the @xmath48-nucleon scattering amplitude at low energies , therefore , is complex . its imaginary part gives a measure of the reactive content of the cross section .",
    "since through the detailed balance theorem , the @xmath82 cross section can be related to the @xmath68 cross section at an appropriate energy , the imaginary part of @xmath28 can be determined directly by the pion - induced eta production data . in @xcite in fact , using this and the optical theorem , a lower limit was set on the value of @xmath13 m ( @xmath28 ) in the following way : the optical theorem gives @xmath83 applying the detailed balance theorem to it we get @xmath84 which results in @xmath85 using the recent threshold data @xcite , @xmath86=15.2@xmath370.8 @xmath87b / mev , gives @xmath88 in the above expressions , @xmath89 is the centre of mass momentum of the particle @xmath90 .    with the real part of @xmath28 , however , this is not the case .",
    "the @xmath9 channel in the @xmath25 elastic scattering shows up as a cusp at the @xmath48 threshold , from where one can not directly determine the value of the real part of @xmath28 .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining re(@xmath28 ) can also be seen from the behaviour of a resonance amplitude as a function of energy .",
    "a typical scattering amplitude proceeding through a resonance has a characteristic behaviour that , its real part goes through zero at the resonance position and the imaginary part peaks at the same position .",
    "knowing that the @xmath9 scattering at low energies is dominated by the @xmath70 resonance , the real part of the @xmath9 amplitude would go through zero at resonance , making it difficult thereby to determine the precise value of the real part of @xmath28 which receives contributions from non resonant processes .",
    "the @xmath9 scattering amplitude in literature has been obtained mostly phenomenologically by analysing the data on the @xmath48 producing pion- and gamma - induced reactions , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "since hadronic and electromagnetic @xmath48 production processes are different , details of @xmath9 scattering extracted from them complement each other . in different analyses , the four channels , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath9",
    "are included and coupled - channels analyses are performed . in all calculations efforts",
    "are always made to include as broad a database as possible and available at the time of a particular calculation .",
    "broadly , these efforts can be classified into two categories . in one class",
    "the available data are directly fitted to the t - matrices for the pion elastic scattering and pion- and gamma induced eta production . in another class , a microscopic model is developed to describe the reaction dynamics , and the parameters of this model are fixed by fitting the data .",
    "the @xmath9 t - matrix is the outcome of these calculations .",
    "these @xmath9 t - matrices in the first approach are only on - shell . for their off - shell application",
    "they need to be extrapolated with some ansatz .",
    "the second approach gives the @xmath9 t - matrix which has some inbuilt off - shell behaviour .",
    "however , because of the inherent fact that the information on the @xmath9 t - matrix is an outcome of these calculations , the predicted values of @xmath28 from all these calculations differ from one another . the real part of the @xmath9 scattering length is found to have a large spread , from about 0.2 to 1 fm .",
    "the calculations in the first category are often done within the k - matrix approach , where the k - matrix is related to the usual t - matrix by the integral equation @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 describes the free motion of the two interacting particles .",
    "the k - matrix is hermitian , and the above transformation ensures that the t - matrix remains unitary .",
    "most detailed k - matrix analyses for the reactions of the present discussion have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "it is gratifying to see that the latest calculations in @xcite and @xcite which use similar inputs give comparable values of @xmath28 = 0.91 + @xmath95 0.27 and 1.14 + @xmath95 0.31 fm , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the extracted on - shell @xmath9 t - matrix from these calculations is made useful to the few - body eta physics by first writing it in the  effective range expansion \" and then extrapolating it to the off - shell region by a simple separable approximation , i.e. @xmath96 with @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the range parameter whose value is not well determined . in @xcite it is taken = 0.31 fm .",
    "the on - shell t - matrix , @xmath99 is written in terms of the scattering amplitude , @xmath100 , using for the latter the effective range expansion , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the eta momentum corresponding to energy e. @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ greenequation ] ) is written using another effective range expansion , namely , @xmath104 where the parameters @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are related to @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath20 .",
    "the scattering amplitude and the t - matrix are related as , @xmath110 .",
    "the best set of the  effective range expansion \" parameters given in @xcite is : @xmath108=0.91 + @xmath95 0.27 fm ; @xmath109 = -1.33 - @xmath95 0.30 fm ; @xmath20 = -0.15 - @xmath95 0.04 fm@xmath36 .    in another class of phenomenological studies , again coupled - channel analyses of the four channels , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath9 are performed , but the t - matrices are now constructed microscopically in dynamical coupled - channel models of meson production reactions including nucleons and their resonances .",
    "the first comprehensive calculation in this class was done in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered the @xmath25 collision channels , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath68 , in the energy region @xmath71=1488 to 1600 mev .",
    "they used a separable interaction model and assumed the reactions to proceed via the @xmath114 or @xmath115 isobars .",
    "the interaction satisfied a lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation @xmath116 with the transition interaction @xmath117 for channel @xmath118 for a given partial wave @xmath119 and for a specific baryon resonance doorway state @xmath120 given by @xmath121 with @xmath122 being the vertex function .",
    "it had the strength @xmath123 of the coupling and the range @xmath124 of off - shell extrapolation as parameters .",
    "the full solution of the coupled channel ls equation was given as @xmath125 where @xmath126 corresponds to the self energy of the particle @xmath90 .",
    "the parameters of the model were @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and the bare mass @xmath127 .",
    "these parameters were determined by fitting the @xmath25 phase shifts .",
    "cross sections for the @xmath128 channel were predicted , which agreed very well with the then available data .",
    "the s - wave @xmath9 scattering lengths obtained from the @xmath9 scattering amplitude from these calculations were 0.27 + @xmath95 0.22 fm and 0.28 + @xmath95 0.19 fm for two available sets of @xmath25 data .",
    "the s@xmath129 @xmath9 phase shifts were found to have positive values , indicating an attractive interaction .",
    "another study in the above class , which is quite recent , is a detailed investigation of the @xmath128 in ref . @xcite .",
    "unlike @xcite this approach fixes all the parameters of the model by fitting all available data on the @xmath128 reaction from threshold up to total centre - of - mass energy of about 2 gev .",
    "constraints on the model parameters from the @xmath25 elastic scattering are incorporated from the earlier studies of this reaction by this group .",
    "the meson baryon ( mb ) channels included in the studies are @xmath25 , @xmath9 , @xmath130 , @xmath81 , and @xmath131 .",
    "the mb transition amplitudes in each partial wave is written as a sum of the background term and a resonance term .",
    "the former is taken energy independent and the latter is taken to have the usual resonance structure with the @xmath132 propagator , @xmath133 , with the associated resonance self - energy , sandwiched between the dressed vertex functions , @xmath134 s .",
    "the calculations include nine nucleon resonances , though the final results of the calculations show that the dominant contribution to the @xmath128 reaction comes from the @xmath70 resonance .",
    "this paper presents the t - matrix for each channel in all partial waves .",
    "the value of the scattering length from the calculated s - wave @xmath9 t - matrix comes out to be @xmath28=0.30 + @xmath95 0.18 fm .",
    "it is very interesting to note that this value agrees very closely with the value obtained about two decades back in @xcite using a similar theoretical framework ( presented in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "theoretical studies have also been done in literature in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath135pt ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath135pt is an effective field theory which maintains the basic symmetries of qcd .",
    "it describes well the interaction between the pseudoscalar ( @xmath136 = 0@xmath137 ) mesons and the ground state baryon octet in an almost parameter free way .",
    "the transition interaction , @xmath117 between different meson - baryon channels in the lowest order chiral lagrangian is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the energy of the incoming ( outgoing ) baryon and @xmath140 denotes the mass of the baryon .",
    "@xmath141 is the weak decay constant of the meson @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath142 is a fixed constant for each transition , reflecting the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the scattering matrices for different channels are obtained by solving the coupled - channels bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "various meson baryon channels ( with @xmath143 mesons and @xmath144 octet baryons ) which couple to strangeness s=0 are @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the values of the scattering length , @xmath28 obtained in this approach in @xcite are 0.20 + @xmath95 0.26 fm , 0.26 + @xmath95 0.25 fm and 0.18 + @xmath95 0.42 fm , respectively . in @xcite , however , a much larger value as compared to these , namely , @xmath28 = 0.54 + @xmath950.49 fm was obtained .",
    "finally , we conclude that the best possible calculations using different models and including all available experimental data have been done to obtain the @xmath9 scattering amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , no definite value for the @xmath9 scattering length is obtained .",
    "there exists a large spread @xcite in the values .",
    "this happens essentially because of the inherent nature of the problem that @xmath28 can not be extracted directly from the experimental data .",
    "we also observe that , in general , the values of @xmath28 coming from theoretical models , like @xmath135pt and microscopic phenomenological models tend to be smaller than those obtained phenomenologically from the experimental data directly .",
    "a table of all values of @xmath28 obtained until 2002 can be found in @xcite .",
    "apart from these and the ones mentioned in the discussions above , there exist calculations with large values such as 0.991 + @xmath95 0.347 fm @xcite , 1.03 + @xmath95 0.49 fm @xcite and a rather small @xmath28 = 0.41 + @xmath95 0.26 fm @xcite .",
    "the existence of an eta - mesic nucleus , i.e. , a quasibound state of the @xmath4 meson and a nucleus was predicted due to the attractive nature of the @xmath9 interaction . since its first mention in 1986 , several experimental and theoretical searches have been performed for light as well as heavy eta - mesic nuclei .",
    "the experimental searches involve the production of @xmath4 mesons and hence signals for the existence of eta - mesic states via their possible decay modes and final state interactions of eta mesons with nuclei .",
    "the theoretical works concentrate on the calculation of the eta - nucleus elastic scattering amplitudes and the solutions with @xmath4-nucleus potentials using different approaches .",
    "possible signals from experiments and the conclusions drawn from theoretical works will be discussed in the subsections below .      due to the attractive @xmath9 interaction and the proximity of its threshold to the mass of the @xmath114 resonance ,",
    "the @xmath4-nucleus interaction can be considered as a series of excitations and decays of @xmath114 on the different constituent nucleons , which eventually decays to the @xmath25 channel , as shown in figure  [ nstar_inmedium ] .",

    "all these works do seem to agree on one point that the forward peaked angular distributions can not be reproduced within the two step model and that the one step model does reproduce the forward peaking . however , they do not agree on the magnitude of the cross sections produced within the one step model .",

    "we summarize some global and specific observations which emerge from this survey .    *",
    "a good estimate of the strength of the @xmath4-nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interaction is crucial for the interpretation of the data on @xmath4 meson production on nuclei and the theoretical prediction of @xmath4-mesic nuclei . with the possibility of obtaining @xmath4-nucleon elastic scattering data being ruled out due to the nonavailability of @xmath4 beams ,",
    "the @xmath9 interaction strength is quantified in terms of a scattering length , a@xmath12 , determined from analyses of @xmath4 production in pion , photon and proton induced reactions .",
    "phenomenological and theoretical studies incorporating meson - baryon coupled channels and the relevant intermediate baryon resonances obtain a wide range of scattering lengths with 0.18 @xmath10 @xmath11e a@xmath12 @xmath10 1.03 fm and 0.16 @xmath10 @xmath13 m a@xmath12 @xmath10 0.49 fm .",
    "such a large spread exists despite the fact that the calculations have been done in the best possible way using different models . +",
    "a closer look at the various values of a@xmath12 obtained in literature , however , demonstrates a curious fact .",
    "most of the theoretical calculations find small values of the real part of a@xmath12 . though the phenomenological determinations in general find both small and big values , one of the most elaborate calculation involving nine baryon resonances and the @xmath25 , @xmath9 , @xmath55 @xmath263 , @xmath81 and @xmath131 coupled channels finds a@xmath12 = 0.3 + @xmath95 0.18 fm which is very close to the very first prediction [ 1 ] of a@xmath12 = 0.28 + @xmath95 0.19 fm .",
    "a smaller @xmath9 scattering length would favour light @xmath4 mesic nuclei [ 40 ] and heavy @xmath4 mesic nuclei with lower binding energies [ 3,19 ] . *",
    "the experimental searches for the existence of @xmath4 mesic nuclei can be broadly divided into two categories ; one searching for a direct signal such as a peak in the missing mass spectra and the other hinting toward the existence of these states through a large enhancement of the @xmath4 production cross sections near threshold . whereas the former data , due to the difficulty in performing such experiments are scarce and not conclusive , the latter depends on theoretical models for interpretation . the theoretical model itself depends on two inputs , namely , the reaction mechanism used and the treatment of the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the @xmath4 meson and nuclei .",
    "many of the @xmath4 production cross sections are reproduced well with values of a@xmath12 much larger than those mentioned at the end of ( i ) above . to reach a definite conclusion one would have to be sure that both the treatment of fsi as well as the reaction mechanism involved bear little uncertainties .",
    "the fsi between the @xmath4 mesons and nuclei is well determined if one uses few body equations rather than resorting to approximate methods for incorporating the fsi .",
    "the uncertainty in the fsi then could arise only from the possible inaccuracy of the @xmath9 transition matrix .",
    "+ the reaction mechanism at threshold seems to be well understood within models based on the two step process .",
    "however , in chapter 4 we saw that at energies away from threshold where the isotropic angular distributions of @xmath4 mesons become forward peaked , limitations do exist in the understanding of the reaction mechanisms .",
    "it could be that at higher energies , there exists an interference rather than just a single mechanism which explains the entire set of data .",
    "further investigations filling up the missing elements in the already existing extensive works is timely .",
    "* the few body treatment of the fsi shows that the large enhancement in the eta - production amplitude near threshold arises mainly due to off - shell scattering of the eta - meson in the final state .",
    "this means that at the production vertex , the @xmath4 meson could in principle be produced off - shell , undergo multiple elastic scatterings from the nucleus and then get converted to an on - shell @xmath4 due to its interaction with the nucleus .",
    "it is important to realize this aspect because many of the eta - meson production works in literature consider only the on - shell scattering of the eta meson in the fsi .",
    "such calculations may necessitate using larger values for a@xmath12 to reproduce the data and consequently may lead to unreliability in the conclusion about the possible existence of eta - nucleus bound states . * the direct signal searches mentioned in ( ii )",
    "were carried out using protons , pions and photons incident on various light nuclei .",
    "some experiments did see the signals indicating the existence of an @xmath4 mesic state but the results were not reconfirmed .",
    "the expectations from the future lie in the experiments planned at the j - parc , mami and cosy facilities .",
    "the k1.8br beamline at j - parc for example will be used to perform the recoilless production and spectroscopy of @xmath4 mesic nuclei using the ( @xmath154 , n ) reaction and targets such as @xmath184li and @xmath40c @xcite . in tables 1 and 2 of the present review",
    "we have collected the pole values of all possible unstable states of @xmath4 mesons and nuclei .",
    "there exists the prediction for quasibound eta - mesic @xmath183he states from a qcd based quark - meson coupling approach @xcite .",
    "quasibound states of @xmath40c and @xmath257o are predicted using different approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the pole values from the different approaches differ a lot .",
    "the predicted range of values can be taken as a guide for the experimental searches and the experimental finding of some eta - mesic states could in turn confirm the validity of one or more of the theoretical approaches used .",
