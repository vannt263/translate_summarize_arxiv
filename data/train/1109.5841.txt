    "the basic problem of extreme value theory ( evt ) is the following ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a primer ) . given a sequence of @xmath0 independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables , we ask how the properly rescaled maxima of the sequence are distributed when @xmath1 . not surprisingly , evt has much importance from the point of view of applications in the natural sciences  @xcite , finance  @xcite , and engineering  @xcite , to name a few . in all these fields one often encounters problems possessing a threshold value for some quantity and",
    "wants to know the probability that it be exceeded ( catastrophic events are a good illustrative example ) .",
    "this question is similar in spirit to that answered by the central limit theorem , which deals with the limits of rescaled sums of i.i.d .",
    "centered random variables . in both cases",
    "one tries to find out whether some kind of universality exists , so that the family of limit distributions is small and their domains of attraction are easy to describe .",
    "the problems of evt and the central limit theorem are naturally addressed in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) , the deepest formalism used in modern physics to understand how a system behaves under a change of the scale of observation . for a treatment of the central limit theorem results and stable distributions in this setup",
    "see refs .",
    "only recently has evt been tackled from the perspective of the renormalization group  @xcite . in the latter references ,",
    "the main motivation was to advance the understanding of the convergence to the limit when the size of the sample data increases .",
    "herein , we employ the rg language to try to discuss and solve a different fundamental problem on the acceptable rescalings and limits of maxima of sequences of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "we describe it next .",
    "let @xmath2 be a probability density in @xmath3 and @xmath4 its distribution function , @xmath5 then , the distribution function for the maximum value of @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "random variables with probability density @xmath2 is given by @xmath6 and the corresponding probability density reads @xmath7 in the limit of large @xmath0 , @xmath8 concentrates around the maximum of the support of @xmath2 .",
    "it is not surprising that in order to obtain a non - trivial limit we have to rescale the random variable .",
    "since this problem was stated for the first time , the most thoroughly studied rescaling has been the affine one : starting from frchet @xcite and fisher and tippet @xcite there has been an extensive literature considering the possible limits of @xmath9 and the domains of attraction . actually , frchet only considered the case @xmath10 while fisher and tippet gave the expression for the possible limit distributions with full generality .",
    "finally , gnedenko @xcite completed the solution of the problem by describing rigorously the domains of attraction of the different limit distributions . but",
    "a natural question is : why to admit only affine rescalings ? at this point , nothing better than quoting from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) :    in this work we try to fill this gap and motivate the study of more general rescalings beyond the affine one .",
    "actually , this is not the first occasion in which non - affine rescaling is considered . in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see . also @xcite for a recent survey on non - linear rescaling ) the authors explore the limit distributions and domains of attraction under power normalization . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that with this normalization the domain of attraction of the different limit distributions is enlarged with respect to that obtained with affine rescaling .",
    "this is , in fact , their main motivation to introduce non - linear normalization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : rgtransformation ] we recast the problem of evt into the rg formalism and show that when the restriction of affine rescalings is relaxed new interesting limit distributions ( fixed points in the rg approach ) appear , apart from the gumbel , weibull , and frchet families . in section [ sec : limitdistributions ] the domains of attraction of the fixed points are studied .",
    "section [ sec : finitesizecorrections ] is devoted to finite - size corrections , i.e. the modification of the limit distributions when the sample size , @xmath0 , is large but finite . in section [ sec : numericaltests ] some examples and illustrative numerical tests are given .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "@xmath11 where , for reasons that will become evident later , we use @xmath12 to parametrize it",
    ".    in terms of the probability density @xmath2 the transformation ( [ rgtransform ] ) reads @xmath13 considering that the support of @xmath8 is equal to the support of @xmath2 it is natural to ask that @xmath14 be a homeomorphism from the support of @xmath2 onto itself , in this way @xmath15 preserves the support of the probability density we start with .",
    "we remark that this condition is not imposed in the works focusing on the affine rescaling .",
    "the transformation @xmath15 can be extended to continuous @xmath16 once the appropriate @xmath14 is defined . a natural requirement for the transformation",
    "@xmath15 is that it forms a uniparametric group , i.e. @xmath17 given the choice of parametrization , this holds provided that @xmath18 and from now on we assume that this is the case .",
    "if we take @xmath14 differentiable with respect to @xmath16 , condition ( [ grouplaw ] ) is equivalent to saying that @xmath14 is solution of the differential equation @xmath19 with initial condition @xmath20 and @xmath21    we are actually interested in the possible extreme limiting distributions , i.e. in @xmath22 .",
    "this , together with the continuity of @xmath15 , implies that @xmath23 must be a fixed point of the renormalization group transformation , @xmath24 assume that this equation has a solution with probability density @xmath25 whose support is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "several important consequences follow .    1 .   for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the interior of @xmath26 , @xmath29 or equivalently @xmath30 .",
    ".1 cm _ proof : _ if @xmath28 is in the interior of @xmath26 the distribution function verifies @xmath31 and is monotonically increasing .",
    "we have @xmath32 and , therefore , @xmath33 and if ( [ fixedpoint ] ) holds we must have @xmath34 , which implies @xmath35 and consequently @xmath36 ( @xmath37 implies @xmath38 ) .",

    "if @xmath39 is at the boundary of @xmath26 then @xmath40 .",
    ".1 cm _ proof : _ a simple consequence of the fact that @xmath14 is a differentiable , uniparametric group of homeomorphisms of @xmath26 and therefore @xmath41 . .2 cm 3 .",

    "@xmath40 implies @xmath41 and if ( [ fixedpoint ] ) holds @xmath42 .",
    "but this is possible only if @xmath43 ( @xmath39 minimum of @xmath26 ) or @xmath44 ( @xmath39 maximum of @xmath26 ) .",
    "the converse is contained in ( ii ) .",

    "the fixed points of cases @xmath50 , @xmath54 and @xmath58 are well known in the literature and comprise the so - called gumbel , weibull , and frchet distributions . while in cases @xmath50 , @xmath58 and @xmath54 the rescaling is affine , it is not so in case 2 .",
    "the limit distributions of case @xmath62 appeared in @xcite in the context of non - linear normalization . in the next section",
    "we shall study this fixed point and its domain of attraction under the renormalization group transformation .",
    "let us consider the rg transformation ( [ rgtransform ] ) for @xmath69 where @xmath66 is a positive real number .",
    "that is , we concentrate on case 2 from section [ sec : rgtransformation ] .",

    "when @xmath70 the general fixed point of the transformation is @xmath71 therefore @xmath72 and , if @xmath73 , we get the uniform distribution .",
    "it is easy to determine the domain of attraction of a given fixed point when @xmath14 is of the form ( [ eq : gscase2 ] ) .",
    "we have the following result :    * proposition . *",
    "a given random variable supported in @xmath74 $ ] with cumulative probability distribution @xmath4 converges weakly ( or in law ) after successive applications of the rg transformation @xmath15 to @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76,\\ ] ] if and only if @xmath77    _ proof : _ if ( [ limit ] ) holds , then we can write @xmath78 and therefore @xmath79 where @xmath80 . the large @xmath16 limit in the expression above yields @xmath81.\\ ] ]    to prove the converse note that the convergence of @xmath82 , taking logarithms and for @xmath83 , can be expressed as @xmath84 or equivalently @xmath85 but given that @xmath86 we have @xmath87 , therefore @xmath88 @xmath89@xmath90    we emphasize that the appearance of these fixed points and attraction domains is due to the non - linear rescaling function @xmath14 , which in turn is motivated by the natural requirement that the rescaling preserves the support of the initial random variable .",
    "if we had considered the standard affine rescaling ,    in the next section we continue the study of the new fixed points with the analysis of the finite - size corrections .",
    "to discuss the amplitude of finite - size corrections and their shape , i.e. the behavior of the extremal distributions when the number of i.i.d random variables @xmath0 is large but finite , we must study the neighborhood of the fixed points and the linear approximation of the rg transformation ( [ rgtransform ] ) .",
    "for this we compute its differential at a probability distribution @xmath4 acting on @xmath91 : @xmath92 the stable and unstable directions of a fixed point @xmath4 are given by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ( [ sec : defdifferential ] ) at @xmath4 .",
    "they determine the amplitude of the finite - size corrections and their shape .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath93 , with @xmath80 and fixed point @xmath75 . in order to solve the eigenvalue equation for ( [ sec : defdifferential ] ) it is very useful to consider the following ansatz @xmath94 . in terms of it",
    ", the eigenvalue equation reads @xmath95 that due to the properties of the fixed point @xmath96 reduces to @xmath97 this is solved by @xmath98 with eigenvalue @xmath99 .",
    "a perturbation of the fixed point is unstable ( or relevant , in the rg terminology ) if the corresponding eigenvalue is greater than one , i.e. @xmath100 and it is stable ( irrelevant ) if @xmath101 .",
    "the case @xmath102 consists of a perturbation tangent to the line of fixed points and , therefore it corresponds to a purely marginal direction .",
    "note that the above analysis is consistent with the domains of attraction determined in section [ sec : limitdistributions ] .",
    "the stable directions are precisely those that do not alter the limit in ( [ limit ] ) , the marginal ones induce an infinitesimal change in the limit and therefore also in the fixed point to which the perturbed distribution tends , and finally an unstable perturbation makes the limit diverge , implying that the perturbed distribution does not converge under successive applications of the rg transformation .    to understand how the linear analysis above is useful to determine the finite size corrections , consider the following situation .",
    "we start with a random variable with cumulative distribution @xmath103 expanded in the eigenvectors obtained above , @xmath104 where the terms in the sum are ordered according to their eigenvalues , so that @xmath105 for @xmath106 .    assuming that all eigenvalues are smaller than one ( @xmath107 ) or , in other words , that @xmath103 belongs to the domain of attraction of @xmath96",
    ", one can show that @xmath108 hence , the largest eigenvalue determines the behavior with @xmath0 ( the size of the system ) of the amplitude of the dominant correction while its eigenfunction determines the shape of the correction .",
    "one can also study corrections of higher order and go beyond the linear approximation . in the next section",
    "we show how to accomplish this and compare our approximations with numerical implementations of the statistical models to test their reliability .",
    "in order to test our theoretical predictions we make two numerical experiments in which we study the distribution for the maxima of @xmath0 independent random variables with a probability density @xmath2 .",
    "the actual size of the systems is chosen so that the perturbative approach discussed above applies and the experiment is repeated a number of times large enough to make the statistical error much smaller than the finite size corrections .",
    "the numerical simulations are performed by generating @xmath0 independent random variables and selecting their maximum .",
    "we divide the interval into 50 bins and after repeating the experiment @xmath109 times we obtain the frequency with which the maximum belongs to a given bin .",
    "the frequency , properly normalized , will be our numerical approximation to @xmath110 , with @xmath80 .",
    "our first example for @xmath2 is the tent distribution , whose probability density is given by @xmath111 observe that the support of @xmath2 is the interval @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "it is plotted , together with the density of its limiting distribution , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the cumulative distribution function determined by @xmath2 is @xmath112 that converges under the action of the rg transformation for @xmath113 to the cumulative distribution function @xmath114    if we perform the expansion in ( [ expansion ] ) we obtain @xmath115 the most relevant ( or rather the least irrelevant ) eigenvalue in the expansion is @xmath116 and it determines the behavior with @xmath0 of the amplitude of the finite - size corrections . in order to quantify the corrections",
    "when the number of random variables is @xmath0 , we use the @xmath117 norm for the difference of the probability densities .",
    "this norm is also called total variation metric in the context of probability theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we expand @xmath118 where @xmath110 with @xmath80 .",
    "the first coefficient is given by @xmath119\\right|\\ { \\hbox{d}}x=\\frac32\\sqrt3\\ee^{-3/2},\\ ] ] and , similarly , one can compute the others to obtain @xmath120    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have plotted the finite - size corrections to the distribution of the maxima obtained numerically scaled with @xmath121 , for different values of the size of the system @xmath0 .",
    "we observe a very good agreement with the theoretical predictions in ( [ finitesize ] ) .",
    "the second prediction that we test numerically is the shape of the corrections . in this case",
    "we take a fixed ( and large ) value for @xmath0 and we plot the rescaled difference between the limiting distribution and the one obtained numerically for the maxima of @xmath0 random variables distributed according to @xmath2 .",
    "the finite - size corrections @xmath122 can be expanded as @xmath123 with the first coefficients given by @xmath124,\\cr \\delta_1(x)&= \\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}x}\\big [ m(x)\\log(x)^4(\\frac{19}6 - 2\\log(x)^2)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "3 the dots represent the points obtained with the numerical experiment for @xmath125 corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "the error bars , a little larger than the size of the dots , represent the statistical uncertainty due to the limited size of the sample .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath127 as defined in ( [ deltas ] ) while the solid line includes the next correction @xmath128 .",
    "we see an excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and the numerical experiment , especially when the subleading correction is included .",
    "the second example has a probability density @xmath129 it converges under the action of the rg with @xmath70 to @xmath130 .",
    "the limiting probability density is @xmath131 .",
    "we can expand again , @xmath132 and we find that the most relevant perturbation has an eigenvalue @xmath133 , which determines the leading behavior with @xmath0 of the amplitude of the finite - size corrections . if we also keep the first subleading terms we obtain @xmath134 with @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we check the validity of this expansion .",
    "we see that within the statistical errors , due to the limited size of the sample , the finite - size corrections agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the shape of the corrections in this case is @xmath136 with the different contributions given by @xmath137    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the numerical value for the shape correction and compare it with the analytical prediction in ( [ finiteshape2 ] ) .",
    "we can see again a remarkable agreement between the numerical experiment and the theoretical prediction .",
    "= 9.89 cm    in the previous examples we have tested the accuracy of the finite size analysis carried out in section [ sec : finitesizecorrections ] .",
    "the size of the system and the sample have been chosen so that the computational time is reasonable and the errors are sufficiently small not to spoil any predictive power . within this range",
    "we have to go beyond first order corrections ( represented by the dashed line in figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) to give a precise description of the experimental results .",
    "the number of terms needed depends , of course , on the concrete details of the problem and the required accuracy .",
    "by employing renormalization group techniques we have studied the limit distribution of the appropriately rescaled maximum value of a sequence of @xmath0 independent , identically distributed random variables when @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the rescaling is needed for obtaining non - trivial limits .",
    "most of the literature on extreme value theory is devoted to the study of these limits under affine rescalings , perhaps by analogy to the treatment of the problem of stable distributions . however , when computing limits of sequences of maxima of independent , identically distributed random variables , it seems natural to impose that the rescaling preserves the support of the original random variable , a condition that the affine rescaling does not meet , in general .",
    "we have recast the problem of finding such limit distributions into the language of the renormalization group , explained how the condition of support preservation naturally arises , and what its implications are .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is showing that in this framework linear and non - linear rescalings are treated on an equal footing , and which one should be employed follows precisely from support preservation . in our formulation",
    "the limit distributions are fixed points of the renormalization group transformation . after the identification and discussion of the fixed points",
    "we have worked out the differential of the transformation around them , with emphasis on those associated to non - linear rescalings .",
    "this helps understand the domains of attraction and the corrections due to large but finite @xmath0 , the so - called finite - size corrections .",
    "an interesting technical aspect of the approach herein adopted is the concrete form of the definition of the renormalization group transformation .",
    "we define it as an uniparametric group of transformations that is fixed once for all , differing from other works in this line where the transformation can be adapted at every step .",
    "this fact has some consequences , especially concerning the domain of attraction of the fixed points .",
    "indeed , within our approach the determination of the domain of attraction is simpler .",
    "one may wonder whether it is possible to modify the classical results on the domains of attraction when we restrict to transformations that preserve the support of the original random variable .    * acknowledgements : * i.  c. acknowledges the hospitality of the department of theoretical physics at the university of zaragoza , where part of this work has been done .",
