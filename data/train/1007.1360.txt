    "b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) are massive and luminous b stars with strong , non - spherical , disk - forming winds .",
    "the conditions in terms of density and temperature within these disks are ideal for efficient molecule and dust formation , traced by co band emission @xcite and a strong near and mid - infrared excess @xcite",
    ". however , the usual distance issue renders it difficult to obtain useful luminosity estimates to classify a galactic b[e ] star definitely as b[e]sg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an additional complication arises from the position of galactic b[e]sg candidates in the empirical hertzsprung - russell diagram , which they share with the pre - main sequence herbig ae / be stars .",
    "even worse , the latter are also surrounded by gas and dust disks @xcite , giving rise to identical observable features such as the infrared excess and the well - pronounced co band emission @xcite . for an unambiguous classification of a galactic b[e ] star as b[e]sg , a reliable tracer based on chemical processing during the evolution of a massive star is thus needed .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "our analysis has shown that the spectra of the b[e]sgs s73 and s12 display emission from the @xmath0co band heads ( see fig.[fig : fits ] ) which means that their circumstellar disk material is strongly enriched with @xmath0c ; hence , these stars are indeed evolved post - main sequence objects .",
    "our model computations have also confirmed the relatively low temperature of the co gas as indicated by the about equal strengths of the @xmath2co band heads .",
    "such low temperatures are not expected within the canonical picture of b[e]sgs , which assumes that their disks are formed by enhanced mass flux from the stars equatorial regions .",
    "if the disks of the two b[e]sgs studied here were continuously supplied , then the co in the gaseous parts of the disk should be visible from the hottest component having temperatures close to the co dissociation temperature of 5000k . in this case the observable co band spectrum , which always reflects the hottest available co component , would be dominated by the peaks of the higher vibrational transitions occurring at longer wavelengths , while the lowest band head ( at 2.3@xmath3 m ) would be strongly suppressed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent deficiency in co gas hotter that @xmath4k therefore suggests that there is no co gas closer to the star .",
    "hence , the disks seen around s12 and s73 can not extend down to the stellar surface .",
    "instead it would be more appropriate to assume that the stars are surrounded by a dense and cool _ ring _ of material .",
    "support for such a scenario comes from the recent detection of a detached ring in quasi - keplerian rotation around the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) b[e]sg star lha115-s65 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , gravitational darkening according to the von zeipel theorem @xcite in rapidly rotating stars can lead to equatorial temperatures being sufficiently low ( i.e. , @xmath5k ) for the hottest co gas to not exceed @xmath4k . in this picture , the disk still could extend from the stellar surface out to large distances , with the co emitting gas located closest to the star within the innermost , hottest disk region . while this scenario is somewhat speculative ( and heating of the disk through light from hotter regions of the star would have to be considered as well ) , we can estimate the minimum rotation speed of the stars required to achieve an equatorial surface temperature of 3000k .",
    "stellar rotation leads the poles to be hottest . assuming that both stars are seen pole - on and that their effective temperatures , @xmath6 , listed in table[tab : parameters ] correspond to the polar values , requires a decrease in @xmath6 from polar to equatorial values by factors of 7.7 ( s12 ) and 4 ( s73 ) .",
    "this , in turn , requires the stars to rotate with @xmath7 of their critical velocity ( see fig.5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the assumed pole - on orientation only provides us with _ lower limits _ of the real rotation velocity , but even in the unexpected case that both stars are seen perfectly pole - on , rotation rates close to or even at the critical limit are highly unlikely . for comparison , the two most rapidly rotating b[e]sgs known , the smc stars lha115-s23 and",
    "lha115-s65 , rotate with @xmath8 of their critical velocity @xcite .",
    "if our program stars rotated at @xmath9 of their critical velocity , resulting equatorial temperatures would still be @xmath10 of the polar values ( cf .",
    "table[tab : parameters ] ) , i.e. much hotter than 3000k .",
    "the deficiency of co gas hotter than 2800k is thus real , and the most plausible scenario is hence that the molecular gas is located within a detached ring of material rather than in a disk extending down to the stellar surface .    in table[tab : bestfit ] we include the sizes of the co emitting regions ( projected to the line of sight , @xmath11 ) as obtained from our best - matching models . from these sizes we estimate the radial extension of the emitting co rings .",
    "we compute the outer radius of the ring as a function of its inner radius .",
    "the results for both stars are depicted by the solid lines in fig.[fig : rout ] indicating that for increasing inner radii the emission area converges towards infinitesimally narrow rings . with the stellar luminosities given in table[tab : parameters ] and an assumed dust sublimation temperature of @xmath12k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we find individual sublimation radii of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for s73 and s12 , respectively .",
    "these maximum outer edges of the co rings are shown in fig.[fig : rout ] as dashed lines .",
    "an estimate for the inner edge of the co ring is less precise .",
    "the co gas has to have a temperature of about 2800k , only slightly higher than the dust sublimation temperature but definitely much lower than the effective temperatures of the stars .",
    "a reasonable estimate could thus be @xmath15 for s73 and ( much ) larger for s12 .",
    "for the latter we plotted the relation between inner and outer radius for two different values of disk inclination .",
    "however , independent of the exact value of @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 as in the case of s12 ) we can conclude that the co emitting area is concentrated within a rather narrow ring at short distance from the central star .",
    "using high - quality @xmath1-band spectra obtained with sinfoni , we detected , for the first time , a 13c enhancement in two b[e]sgs in the lmc , thereby confirming their evolved nature .",
    "the enrichment of their disk - forming wind material with @xmath0c and the resulting strong @xmath0co band emission , as was suggested by @xcite , is thus shown to be a robust method for the identification of evolved stars .",
    "this method can now be applied to the galactic b[e]sg candidates to disentangle the real galactic b[e]sgs from the more abundant herbig ae / be stars .    in our analysis",
    ", we also found a deficiency of hot co gas in the disks of both stars .",
    "this can be explained in two ways .",
    "either both stars rotate at their critical limit so that equatorial surface temperatures ( and hence , maximum disk temperatures ) drop below @xmath18k and no hot co gas is expected , or the co emitting region is located in a high - density , detached ring of material rather than in an equatorially enhanced , disk - forming wind . while the former scenario can not be excluded , we consider the latter as the more realistic one since it also agrees with the recently found detached gas ring around the smc b[e]sg star lha115-s65 by @xcite .",
