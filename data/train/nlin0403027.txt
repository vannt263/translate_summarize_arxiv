    "the enhanced mixing of a passive scalar is one of the most direct consequences of chaos : a flow whose trajectories exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions will lead to rapid mixing .",
    "there are powerful theories based on the distribution of lyapunov exponents  @xcite that link the mixing rate of the passive scalar with the chaotic properties of the flow . it has been recently suggested , following earlier work of pierrehumbert  @xcite , that the mixing properties of the flow can often be elucidated only by solving a full eigenvalue problem for the advection  diffusion operator , in an analogous manner to what is done for the kinematic dynamo  @xcite .",
    "the resulting eigenfunctions have been dubbed _",
    "strange eigenmodes _ by pierrehumbert , and are closely related to pollicott ",
    "ruelle resonances in ergodic theory  @xcite , which describe the long - time decay of correlations in mixing hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "strange eigenmodes have also been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "they are often called _ persistent patterns _ or _",
    "large - scale eigenfunctions_.    the strange eigenmodes reflect a balance between advection and diffusion . on its own",
    ", advection is incapable of achieving mixing : it shuffles the concentration field of the passive scalar but does not decrease its fluctuations .",
    "the role of advection is to stir the concentration field , thereby creating sharp gradients in concentration .",
    "physically , these gradients are reflected in the filamentation experienced by a blob of dye when it is stirred .",
    "the sharp gradients enhance the role of diffusion tremendously , and this allows mixing to proceed . as the diffusivity of the scalar is made smaller , the scale at which this mixing occurs decreases , so the concentration field appears very rough . in the limit of arbitrarily small diffusivity ,",
    "the concentration field is not smooth : it consists of a superposition of strange eigenmodes .",
    "the dominant one among these eigenfunctions is called _ the _ strange eigenmode , although there may be several of comparable importance .    in the present work we tie the two types of theories together ( _ i.e. _ , lyapunov exponent - based and strange eigenmode ) for a specific system , which was already studied in  @xcite from the strange eigenmode viewpoint .",
    "the strange eigenmode represents a fundamentally eulerian ( spatial ) view of mixing , whereas the lyapunov exponent view is lagrangian ( material ) , following as it does the stretching history of fluid elements . in the strongly chaotic systems we deal with in the present context ,",
    "lagrangian and eulerian coordinates are related by a convoluted transformation .",
    "this transformation is so complex that its specific form is inaccessible ( even numerically ) after some time , a reflection of sensitivity to initial conditions . for long times",
    ", the two frames must be regarded as essentially independent : we can not simply solve a problem in eulerian coordinates and transform to lagrangian coordinates ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "thus we believe it is worthwhile to take a chaotic system whose solution has already been obtained in eulerian coordinates and solve it in lagrangian coordinates . as indicated above , this links two views of mixing together , and in particular illustrates the nature of strange eigenmodes in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "this also indicates the source of the breakdown of local theories . we will show that there exists a kind of _ lagrangian strange eigenmode _ , which is not quite an eigenmode but which exhibits similar features :",
    "specifically , it is an eigenmode if an appropriate time - dependent rescaling of coordinates is performed ( exponential in time ) .",
    "this rescaling is closely related to the `` cone '' involved in diffusive problems in the presence of an exponentially stretching flow  @xcite .",
    "we call it the _ cone of safety _ , because modes inside it are sheltered from diffusion at a given time .",
    "we introduce the system to be studied , the perturbed cat map , in section  [ sec : torusmap ] .",
    "we find its finite - time lyapunov exponents and eigenvectors using first - order perturbation theory . in section",
    "[ sec : ad ] we partially solve the advection  diffusion equation  for our map , again using perturbation theory . some numerical work is needed to complete the solution , and this is described in section  [ sec : numres ] . finally , a few concluding remarks are offered in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the strange eigenmode has for the most part been studied in maps , because these present great advantages for analytical work .",
    "this is also reasonable since experimental work has so far focused on time - periodic flows  @xcite . as in  @xcite",
    ", we consider the map @xmath0 defined on the unit two - torus ,  . here",
    "@xmath1 is a matrix of integers with unit determinant , and  @xmath2 is a doubly - periodic function , so that  @xmath3 is a diffeomorphism ; specifically , we take @xmath4 where  @xmath2 is chosen such that  @xmath3 is area - preserving . for  @xmath5 ,",
    "is the usual cat map of arnold  @xcite .",
    "the map   inherits much of the simplicity of the cat map , but the perturbation allows for more complex  and less singular  behavior .",
    "the action of the map is depicted in fig .",

    "the gray shading shows the action of the unperturbed cat map . ]",
    "we are interested in the mixing properties of the map  @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite mixing in this map was investigated from an eulerian perspective : advection alternated with diffusion and the central object was the distribution of the concentration field in eulerian coordinates . for  @xmath5",
    ", mixing occurs superexponentially in the map , due to the lack of dispersion in fourier space .",
    "the concentration in a given fourier mode is mapped entirely to one mode of higher wavenumber , and so on to ever higher wavenumbers .",
    "this sequence of wavenumbers have exponentially - growing magnitudes . because diffusion is exponential in the wavenumber , the net result is superexponential decay ( _ i.e. _ , the exponential of minus an exponential in time ) .    for  @xmath7 ,",
    "the situation is radically different .",
    "the map now disperses concentration among many fourier modes at each iteration .",
    "in particular , some concentration is always mapped back to the lowest allowable wavenumber ( the grave mode ) , on which the weak diffusion is ineffective .",
    "the decay of the scalar is then limited by how much concentration is mapped to this grave mode at each iteration .",
    "the grave mode thus forms the seed of a strange eigenmode , since an eigenmode is by definition a _ recurring _ feature .",
    "the concentration field thus settles into the slowest - decaying eigenfunction of the advection ",
    "diffusion operator  the strange eigenmode ",
    "analogously to earlier work  @xcite .    here",
    "we wish to solve the same problem as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "this means that we focus on following fluid elements and describing how they deform under the action of the map . to solve the advection ",
    "diffusion problem in lagrangian coordinates , it is necessary to have expressions for the finite - time lyapunov exponents of the map  @xcite ( or equivalently the coefficients of expansion ) and their associated characteristic directions , as a function of lagrangian coordinates , and not just their distribution ( we will see why this is so in section  [ sec : ad ] ) . because the finite - time lyapunov exponents are easily derived for the cat map ( @xmath5 ) , we shall proceed perturbatively , assuming  @xmath6 is small .",
    "first let us give the lyapunov exponents and associated characteristic directions for the unperturbed cat map .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are the logarithms of the eigenvalues of  @xmath1 , and the characteristic directions are the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "it is convenient to introduce an angle  @xmath8 in terms of which the eigenvectors of  @xmath1 are @xmath9 with  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 .",
    "then the corresponding eigenvalues of  @xmath1 are    @xmath12    [ eq : nugr ]    these equalities are specific to this particular angle , as is the relation  @xmath13 .",
    "the  @xmath14 direction is associated with stretching , and  @xmath15 with contraction .",
    "the coefficients of expansion ( given by  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 after  @xmath18 iterations of the map ) and characteristic directions for the linear cat map are uniform in space .",
    "now we derive their value for  @xmath6 nonzero but small , using perturbation theory .",
    "the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix  @xmath19 , with components @xmath20 often called the metric tensor ( or cauchy  green strain tensor in fluid mechanics ) . here",
    "@xmath21 is the lagrangian label ( coordinate ) and  @xmath22 is the  @xmath18th iterate of the point  @xmath21 under the action of the map   ( so that  ) .",
    "the metric tensor describes the stretching experienced at the  @xmath18th iteration by a fluid element initially at  @xmath21 .",
    "its eigenvalues and eigenvectors give the shape and orientation at the  @xmath18th iteration of an ellipsoid representing an initially spherical infinitesimal element of fluid .",
    "before we can apply perturbation theory to the metric tensor , we must find the form of the perturbation itself . to first order in  @xmath6 ,",
    "the  @xmath18th iterate of the map   is @xmath23 the jacobian matrix of this transformation is @xmath24 where the numerator corresponds to rows and the denominator to columns of a matrix .",
    "we must now construct the metric tensor  , which to leading order in  @xmath6 is @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the tilde denotes the transpose of a matrix .",

    "we refer the reader to standard texts on the subject  @xcite .    to leading order in  @xmath6 ,",
    "the coefficient of stretching is written as @xmath29 where  @xmath16 is the coefficient of stretching of the unperturbed cat map , and the correction   is obtained from the perturbation by contraction with the unperturbed eigenvectors  @xcite , @xmath30 observe that because the coefficient of stretching is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of  @xmath31 , there is an extra factor of  @xmath32 to leading order in  @xmath6 . using the fact that , for  @xmath1 symmetric ,  @xmath33 , we find eqs .   and   give @xmath34 where we have substituted the specific form of the map , given by  .",

    "we will first discuss the case for an incompressible flow , and then make the transition to a volume - preserving map .",
    "the advection  diffusion equation  for the concentration of a scalar ,  @xmath52 , advected by an incompressible velocity field  @xmath53 is @xmath54 where  @xmath55 is the diffusion coefficient .",

    "the flow enters   indirectly through the metric tensor in  , reflecting the enhancement to diffusion due to the deformation of fluid elements  @xcite .",
    "we now make the leap from a flow to a map : because the velocity field does not enter   directly , we may regard the time dependence in  @xmath61 as given by a map rather than a flow , and use the metric   in the diffusion tensor  @xmath61  .",
    "we also write  @xmath64 for  @xmath60 , where  @xmath18 denotes the  @xmath18th iterate of the map .    since our map is defined on the torus , we can expand  @xmath64 in fourier components  @xmath65 ; the resulting map , obtained by first fourier transforming and then solving  , is @xmath66 where @xmath67 with  @xmath68 the period of the map .",

    "we say fortunately because without such a formula it is very difficult to compute this matrix exponential  even numerically  due to the large size of the matrices ( _ i.e. _ , infinite ) and their magnitude ( _ i.e. _ , growing exponentially in time ) .",
    "the  @xmath27 term in  @xmath83 seems to imply that  @xmath65 decays _ superexponentially _ fast as @xmath84 . from eulerian considerations  @xcite , we know that for   the decay is actually exponential after a short superexponential transient .",
    "this is because the  @xmath85 term must be taken into account : it breaks the diagonality of  @xmath69 , so that given some initial set of wavevectors , the concentration contained in those modes can be transferred elsewhere .",
    "in particular , it can transfer concentration to modes aligned with the unstable direction .",
    "we will see how this avoids superexponential decay in section  [ sec : numres ] .",
    "at this point , solving   and   numerically seems like the only way forward .",
    "clearly , attempting the solve this on a grid in fourier space is hopeless : very high wavenumber modes are quickly populated so the resolution is exhausted very rapidly .",
    "instead , the procedure we use involves keeping track of a list of excited fourier modes ( _ i.e. _ , those that are nonzero to machine precision ) .",
    "we now describe this scheme .",
    "first , an initial wavenumber is seeded with some initial concentration .",
    "this mode will be damped by the diagonal part of the matrix in  , and will also excite two new modes as seen in  . repeating this , starting now from three modes , we see that the number of excited modes grows exponentially .",
    "thus it would seem that this procedure is not very advantageous ; however , after a few iteration the diffusivity ( the diagonal part in  ) will damp most modes because  @xmath86 is growing exponentially . thus the modes that have been damped beyond redemption can be removed from the list . in this manner",
    "the number of excited modes eventually reaches a constant , though they consist of ever higher wavenumbers .",
    "thus one can think of a `` packet '' of modes cascading through fourier space towards larger wavenumbers .",
    "it is this packet that is the lagrangian analogue of the strange eigenmode in eulerian space , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : lagrstr ] .",
    "let us first present some results .     and",
    "different values of  @xmath87 , compared to the result from eulerian coordinates ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the exact result for superexponential decay ( @xmath5 ) for  @xmath88 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : var_eps=0.001 ] shows the decay of the scalar variance for   and four values of the diffusivity .",
    "the agreement with the eulerian results is excellent for early times , but inevitably breaks down later .",
    "( in fact the variance eventually begins to _ increase _ , which is forbidden . )",
    "the agreement is also worse for smaller diffusivity .",
    "both of these disagreements are a manifestation of the wavenumber dependence of the perturbation in  : for  @xmath89 too large the perturbation becomes large , invalidating the approach .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : var_eps=0.001 ] clearly validates the calculation for times that are not too long .",
    ", at the fourth iteration .",
    "the dashed line indicates an  @xmath48 dependence , showing that the two agree to first order in  @xmath6 . ]",
    "another validation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : converg ] , where we plot the difference between the eulerian and lagrangian results as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the difference clearly scales as  @xmath90 , showing that the two agree at leading order , as required for a first - order asymptotic result .",
    "we now interpret our results in greater detail , and look for a manifestation of the strange eigenmode in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the mechanism described in section  [ sec : nummet ] is similar to that originally introduced ( in the context of the kinematic dynamo problem ) by zeldovich  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite : they basically solved the advection ",
    "diffusion equation  in lagrangian coordinates for a linear velocity field , and found that in order to avoid rapid superexponential decay one had to restrict attention to a `` cone '' of wavenumbers that are closely aligned with the unstable manifold of the flow ( a similar approach was used later in refs .",
    "the exponential shrinking in time of this `` cone of safety '' leads to an exponential decay of scalar variance at a rate given by the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the problem with that approach is that a linear velocity field offers no possibility of _ dispersion _ in fourier space .",
    "the wavenumbers in the cone of safety must have some concentration associated with them initially .",
    "what our numerical results show is that if one considers dispersion in fourier space ( of the type allowed by the  @xmath85 term in  ) then it is possible for concentration to be moved inside the cone from elsewhere .",
    "the lagrangian equivalent of the strange eigenmode must live within the cone of safety , otherwise it would decay away superexponentially .",
    "but unlike ref .  @xcite the decay rate in the present case is not determined by the shrinking of the cone : it is set by how much variance gets transferred into the cone at each iteration .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows a plot of the power spectrum of concentration .",
    "( circles ) and  @xmath91 ( black dots ) .",
    "the large black dots are points that are the same for all iterations ( after rescaling ) : this is the dominant strange eigenmode in lagrangian coordinates . both axes",
    "have been rescaled such that the dominant peak has unit amplitude and wavenumber ( @xmath92 is defined in eq .  ) .",

    "the concentration is normalized at each iteration such that the mode with largest concentration has unit magnitude .",
    "the iterations plotted are  @xmath95 ( circles ) and  @xmath91 ( black dots ) .",
    "most of the circles appear as large black dots , because all these points lie on top of each other .",
    "hence , the concentration is in an eigenstate , given that the wavenumber has been rescaled by a factor proportional to  @xmath96 ( _ i.e. _ , such that the dominant peak is at unit rescaled wavenumber ) .",
    "this is what we interpret as the lagrangian equivalent of the strange eigenmode ( a good name might be `` stretched eigenmode '' in fourier space ) .    some points in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] exhibit a decay with iteration number ( appearing as columns of circles , with higher iteration numbers lower on the graph ) : they belong to a more rapidly - decaying eigenfunction .",
    "note that the peaks do not sharpen with iteration number , but more points are added to some of the tails .",
    "the eigenfunction appears extremely rough and discontinuous , though the peaks are indicative of some underlying continuum behavior .",
    "the seemingly isolated points actually tend to line up with a peak far below .",
    "finally , note that the relative height ( but not position or shape ) of the peaks depends on  @xmath6 : the whole shape is stretched vertically as  @xmath6 is made smaller .",
    "this is because the term proportional to  @xmath6 controls the transfer of concentration `` vertically '' ( with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) in the eigenmode at each iteration .",
    "the lagrangian strange eigenmode has some intriguing features : ( i ) it is rescaled exponentially in time , in order to remain within the cone of safety ( so it is not a true eigenmode ) ; ( ii ) its power spectrum is very discontinuous , in sharp contrast to its eulerian counterpart  @xcite ; ( iii ) its decay rate is set by how much concentration is moved into the `` new '' cone of safety at each iteration ( since the cone is shrinking ) . in the appendix we present an analytic result for a two - mode system which gives a simplified representation of the cone of safety .    in the map analyzed here",
    "the exponential time - rescaling gives a proper eigenmode , since only the constant stretching is important at leading order . in a generic map",
    "the stretching is a strong function of space , so the necessary time - rescaling would be position - dependent .",
    "it is hard to see how the lagrangian approach presented here could be used in more realistic problems : perturbation theory was used extensively ( which would not be applicable in most real situations ) , both for computing the finite - time lyapunov exponents and the matrix exponential  .",
    "we believe the approach is instructive nonetheless , giving as it does a picture of the strange eigenmode in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "our approach does not yield much information about the long - time behavior of the decay .",
    "there is currently a debate as to whether the mechanism presented in refs .",

    "though we have not found a general method of solution of   with the exponential given by  , there is at least an approximate solution available that illustrates the broad features of a full solution . it also shows how the decay rate of the variance can become independent of the diffusivity in the lagrangian viewpoint , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method is based on defining a class of `` aligned '' wavenumbers ( _ i.e. _ , that live inside the cone of safety ) , and retaining only two of these modes .",
    "these wavenumbers  @xmath97 are defined by @xmath98 that is ,  @xmath99 , where  @xmath100 is any initial wavenumber for large enough  @xmath101 .",
    "then  @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 so that with the choice  @xmath104 , @xmath105 , the first kronecker delta in   is unity for  @xmath106 .",
    "define @xmath110 which is independent of  @xmath18 , since we have defined  @xmath101 relative to the current iteration of the map .",
    "it can be shown that then the coupling from  @xmath108 to  @xmath107 takes the simple form @xmath111    to recapitulate : at the  @xmath18th iteration , the mode  @xmath107 is mapped to itself with coupling amplitude  @xmath112 , and  @xmath108 is mapped to  @xmath107 with amplitude  @xmath113 .",
    "it is easy to show that in this two - mode situation the decay rate is determined by the magnitude of  @xmath113 .",
    "all that remains is to find  @xmath109 .",
    "the `` lag '' @xmath109 is obtained by maximizing  @xmath113 over  @xmath109 ; @xmath109 has to be large enough that  @xmath114 overcomes the tiny diffusivity in  so the two  @xmath115 terms do nt cancel in  but not so large that  @xmath112 is damped .",
    "we are thus justified in approximating   ( the other term in   is smaller by a factor  @xmath116 , which is small even for  @xmath117 ) .",
    "we then have @xmath118 since  .",
    "this is easily extremized over  @xmath119 : the maximum  @xmath120 is achieved for  , for which  @xmath121 .",
    "the lag is then given by solving for  @xmath109 in terms of the extremizing  @xmath119 , @xmath122 which scales logarithmically with the diffusivity .",
    "note that the decay rate is now completely independent of the actual value of the diffusivity : the lag adjusts itself to compensate , introducing a separation of scale between the dominant wavenumber  @xmath107 and the largest wavenumber in the system ,  @xmath123 .",
    "the actual decay rate as  @xmath124 ( from the eulerian solution in  @xcite ) is  @xmath125 for small  @xmath6 , compared to the two - mode lagrangian solution  @xmath126 .",
    "thus , most of the important behavior is captured by the two - mode solution .",
    "the two modes can be seen in the spectrum of the strange eigenmode in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] : the dominant peak at   is  @xmath107 ( @xmath127 in this case ) , and the peak at   is  @xmath108 .",
    "the other peaks are modes that could be included to get a more accurate expression for the decay rate .",
    "the two - mode solution also nicely illustrates the idea of the cone of safety : both modes are always inside it , and because the cone is shrinking by a factor  @xmath128 at each iteration then the modes have to follow suit . the key difference with  @xcite",
    "is that here the concentration in the modes is _ mapped _ from one cone to another at each iteration , and is not part of the initial condition ."
