    "two - path interference along classical trajectories has a long - standing tradition as a textbook showpiece of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "a fascinating realization of two - path interference on a macroscopic scale has recently been achieved in near threshold photodetachment microscopy @xcite . here , electrons are released from negative ions by irradiation with a laser beam in the presence of a uniform external electric field which subsequently governs their motion .",
    "blondel et  al .",
    "@xcite recorded field - induced interference fringes in configuration space for o@xmath0 and several other ionic species . in their experiment ,",
    "the motion of the electrons can be considered as the quantum analogue of throwing a classical particle at constant energy in a uniform gravitational field . within the",
    "classically allowed `` shot - put''-range two distinct trajectories will link the electron source with a given destination , causing `` double slit '' interference in the quantal case . using detectors with high spatial resolution ,",
    "images of the resulting fringes were obtained by blondel et  al .",

    "[ setup_exp ] ) . in this way",
    ", their `` photodetachment microscope '' demonstrated the nodes and antinodes of the electronic wave function , allowing precise determination of the electron affinity  @xcite . in order to advance the understanding of the imaging mechanism of their device , this letter serves to point out the intricate spatial properties of the photoelectronic current distribution in parallel electric and magnetic fields .",
    "( the integrated photocurrent , i.  e.  the total photodetachment cross section in parallel fields has been addressed theoretically by several authors @xcite .",
    "their results are implicitly contained in the following developments . )    for photon energies close to the electron affinity of the ion , the photodetachment process becomes insensitive to details of the initial and final atomic states involved , and the shape of the electronic scattering wave in the external field environment is determined by its parity and the electron excess energy @xmath2 alone @xcite . in a formal description , we may thus replace the photon - ion interaction as an electron - generating mechanism by a fixed pointlike `` source '' that emits electrons with proper angular characteristics @xcite . on grounds of simplicity , in this letter",
    "we only consider the simplest case of isotropic emission that applies to blondel s choice of o@xmath0 as ionic species .",
    "[ setup_exp ] illustrates that for a purely electric field , blondel s results @xcite and the predictions from the source model are in excellent accordance .",
    "it should be pointed out that the experimental setup was shielded against magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , fields as weak as the earth magnetic field ( @xmath3  t ) will already change the interference pattern appreciably . for parallel @xmath4 and @xmath5fields ,",
    "the lorentz force will cause circular cyclotron motion in the plane perpendicular to the fields , while uniform acceleration takes place in the electric field direction .",
    "classically , all electrons emitted by a point source at the origin @xmath6 will return to the symmetry axis of the system after times of flight @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is the larmor frequency of the electrons , and @xmath10 their charge to mass ratio .",
    "hence , in a temporal scheme , the lateral electron distribution is periodically refocused into a sharply defined `` resonance . ''",
    "since the distance of an electron from the source is largely determined by its time of flight , these resonances translate into a series of narrow spatial constrictions of the electronic current along the symmetry axis of the system located around @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the electric force : the external potential acts as an `` electromagnetic lens . ''",
    "because the analogy between the temporal and the spatial picture is not perfect , however , the projection of the electron source is distorted into a filament structure whose dimensions grow with increasing electron energy . in this letter",
    ", our main attention is directed towards these resonance regions .",
    "a thorough classical analysis of the problem shows that in a uniform electric field environment , within a range of paraboloid shape always two particle trajectories of energy @xmath2 exist that connect the source @xmath13 with a given destination @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "an additional parallel magnetic field will split this continuous sector of two - path degeneracy into a series of distinct regions with finite spatial extension , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ res_overview ] . for weak fields ,",
    "adjacent structures barely overlap , forming the `` bottlenecks '' that characterize the current resonances .",
    "consequently , here the turning surfaces of the intersecting two - path regions delineate a sector where the number of classical trajectories joining source and destination is doubled to four .",
    "[ res_detail ] displays a section of the resonance area with its intertwining caustic surface structure .    in near - threshold emission , the resolution of this electromagnetic microscope",
    "is limited by diffraction , i.e. , by the uncertainty constraint @xmath15 @xcite . in this regime",
    "the resonances are characterized by a gaussian current profile , whose typical diameter ( @xmath16 nm ) much exceeds the size of the emitting ions .",
    "in our model , we introduce a stationary source term @xmath17 @xcite to the stationary schrdinger equation : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the hamiltonian for quantum ballistic motion in a uniform electric and magnetic field @xmath20}^2     -{\\mathbf r}\\cdot{\\mathbf f},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the orbital angular momentum @xcite . by choosing @xmath22",

( [ eq : psi_source ] ) is formally solved by the appropriate green function @xmath25 : @xmath26 and the associated current density reads @xmath27 the outgoing - wave boundary condition is satisfied only by the retarded green function @xmath28 . since @xmath19 is quadratic in the position and momentum operators , we can use the propagator representation @xmath29\\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath30 being the classical action and @xmath31 a factor independent of @xmath32 @xcite . for uniform electric and magnetic fields aligned to the @xmath33axis we obtain @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",

    "overall , the ring pattern obtained by rotating the current density around the @xmath33axis is similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ setup_exp ] , but its diameter undergoes repeated oscillations .",
    "the current profile can be approximated semiclassically by applying the method of stationary phase to eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagator ] ) .",
    "the stationary points are those of the reduced classical action @xmath40 , and they represent all classical trajectories of emission energy @xmath2 that connect the source located at @xmath24 with a given destination @xmath32 on the detector @xcite . for fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "all classical trajectories start with initial kinematic momentum @xmath41 . if we denote the angle between the @xmath33-axis and the direction of emission by @xmath42 , the classical equation of motion @xmath43 can be used to determine the shape of the envelope of the current profile . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : classicalmotion ] ) , the maximum lateral extension is given by the cyclotron radius @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . to obtain the minimum lateral extension we observe that @xmath47 will periodically vanish at @xmath48 .",
    "however , due to the initial momentum , at these instances the trajectories will cover a range of @xmath33coordinates from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "the number of trajectories connecting the source with a point on the detector is obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : classicalmotion ] ) for @xmath51 with @xmath52 fixed . in general , the twofold degeneracy familiar from the purely electric case ( fig .",
    "[ setup_exp ] ) persists , but close to the center of a resonance ( given by @xmath53 ) there exists a transition region with four classical trajectories , as depicted in fig .",

    "( [ eq : propagator ] ) , faithfully reproduces the exact quantum solution available from eqs .",

    "the encircled numbers denote the count of classical trajectories in each sector .",
    "they are delineated by two caustic surfaces ( solid lines ab and ad ) that approximately read in parametrized form @xmath54 : @xmath55 thus , the constriction is narrowest at @xmath56 , where the width @xmath57 of the focal spot is independent of @xmath5 : @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly , the elongation of the resonance region @xmath59 does not involve the electric field @xmath4 .",
    "we should point out that the resonances will overlap ( @xmath60 ) for @xmath61 . in this instance , the number of classical paths may exceed four .",
    "at the photodetachment threshold ( @xmath62 ) , the classical width of the current filament , @xmath63 , approaches zero .",
    "however , the uncertainty principle will put some constraints on the lateral current density distribution .",
    "let us first elaborate on the classical picture : since the emission is isotropic , the average value of @xmath64 is @xmath65 . for the mean square width @xmath66 of the distribution ,",
    "we integrate over all trajectories @xmath67 ( eq .  [ eq : classicalmotion ] ) that arrive at @xmath56 . for non - overlapping resonances ,",
    "this procedure yields approximately : @xmath68 in a quantal treatment the relevant operators are the canonical momentum operator and the position operator : @xmath69 for these operators the relation @xmath70 must hold @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ uncertainty ] we compare the expectation value @xmath71 as calculated from the green function eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenqm ] ) with the corresponding classical average @xmath72 as a function of energy .",
    "once the classical average exceeds the quantum limit @xmath73 , the semiclassical theory provides a good estimate for the uncertainty product ( and the current profile in general ) . for sufficiently small energies",
    "@xmath2 , however , a quantal regime prevails : the uncertainty quickly approaches its lower boundary , and consequently , the current distribution becomes gaussian in shape @xcite .",
    "typically , this behaviour becomes prevalent at energies of order @xmath74 ; the resulting minimum uncertainty wave function is considerably extended in space , as an estimate of the focal spot radius @xmath75 shows : for the field strengths used experimentally @xcite , a resolution of order @xmath76 nm is achieved .",
    "we have studied near - threshold photodetachment in the presence of parallel static electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we saw that the magnetic field focuses the photoelectrons into a series of spatially repeating constrictions .",
    "the topography of the resonances was calculated and analyzed in terms of classical paths @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that the superposition of four classical paths generally accounts for the involved interference pattern present in the constriction sector .",
    "however , below a critical emission energy , the current distribution is governed by the uncertainty principle , and the resonances are characterized by a simple gaussian profile .",
    "strictly , the energy shift @xmath79 caused by the electron spin should be included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi_source ] ) .",
    "the actual current distribution arises by superposition of both spin components . for weak fields ,",
    "however , the effects of spin are negligible , and we will omit them here ."
