    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation naturally predicts the existence of strong gravitational lens systems with image separations of @xmath7 or even larger",
    ". observations of massive clusters of galaxies have revealed many systems of `` giant arcs '' representing lensed images of background galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , until recently all lensed quasars and radio sources had image separations @xmath8 corresponding to lensing by galaxies , despite some explicit searches for lenses with larger separations @xcite .",
    "lensing of quasars by clusters was finally observed with the recent discovery and confirmation of sdss j1004 + 4112 , a quadruple lens with an image separation of @xmath9 found in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "this lens confirms an important prediction of the cdm model ; indeed , the lensing probability inferred from the discovery is in agreement with reasonable values of the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the statistics of large - separation lenses can be used to place constraints on the density profile of dark halos @xcite , or determine the abundance of massive dark halos @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the first such lens suggests that these statistics can be a practical tool to study structure formation in the universe .",
    "the statistics of giant arcs are also known as a good probe of clusters @xcite , and in fact lensed arcs and quasars complement each other in several ways .",
    "for instance , in lensed quasar surveys one first identifies source quasars and then checks whether they are lensed , while in searching for lensed arcs one selects massive clusters and then searches for lensed arcs in them . in other words , surveys for arcs",
    "are biased toward high mass concentrations , while lensed quasars probe random lines of sight .",
    "clusters selected by the presence of lensed quasars could , in principle , differ from those selected as having giant arcs . in addition , lensed quasars have three advantages over lensed arcs in statistical studies .",
    "first , quasars can be regarded as point sources , while sources for arcs are galaxies whose intrinsic sizes and shapes are important but unobservable .",
    "second , the number and configuration of images in a quasar lens system is unambiguous .",
    "third , the redshift distribution of arc sources is poorly known ( and controversial ; see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the redshift distribution of quasars is well known .    in all previous analytic work on the statistics of large - separation lensed quasars ,",
    "the lens objects were assumed to be spherical .",
    "however , in the cdm model dark halos are not spherical at all but triaxial ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter js02 ) .",
    "it is already known that triaxiality has a significant effect on the statistics of lensed arcs , from both analytic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ols03 ) and numerical ( @xcite ; @xcite ) points of view .",
    "in the statistics of normal lensed quasars , triaxiality ( or ellipticity ) has been thought to mainly affect the image multiplicities , with only small changes to the total lensing probability @xcite .",
    "however , that conclusion is based on nearly - singular isothermal lens models , and the situation may be quite different for the less concentrated mass distributions of the massive halos that create large - separation lenses",
    ". moreover , only triaxial modeling allows us to study image multiplicities , and to consider whether it is statistically natural that the first known large - separation lens is a quadruple .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : theory ] we review the triaxial dark halo model and its lensing properties ( originally presented by js02 and ols03 ) . in  [ sec : prob ] we show our general results , while in  [ sec : sdss ] we customize our predictions to the sdss quasar sample .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : sum ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath10-dominated cosmology with current matter density @xmath11 , cosmological constant @xmath12 , dimensionless hubble constant @xmath13 , and normalization of matter density fluctuations @xmath14 .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the lensing properties of the triaxial model of dark halos proposed by js02 .",
    "for more details , please refer to js02 and ols03 .",
    "first , we relate the principal coordinate system of the triaxial dark halo @xmath15 to the observer s coordinate system @xmath16 , where the @xmath17-axis runs along the line of sight to the observer . in general ,",
    "the coordinate transformation is expressed as @xmath18 with @xmath19 the density profiles of triaxial dark matter halos proposed by js02 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath20 where @xmath21 two models commonly discussed in the context of cdm simulations are @xmath5 and 1.5 @xcite , and we focus on these . js02 give fitting formulas for the axis ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the triaxial model , and for the concentration parameter @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is defined such that the mean density within the ellipsoid of the major axis radius @xmath25 is @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "what matters for lensing is the projected surface mass density in units of the critical density for lensing , or the convergence @xmath28 , which can be expressed as ( ols03 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless `` strength '' parameter ( defined in ols03 ) , @xmath31 is the axis ratio of the projected mass distribution , and @xmath32 for @xmath5 , equation ( [ f_nfw ] ) has an analytic expression @xcite . for @xmath6",
    ", we adopt a fitting formula for equation ( [ f_nfw ] ) presented by ols03 .",
    "note that the convergence has elliptical symmetry , so the lensing deflection and magnification can be computed with a set of 1-dimensional integrals @xcite .",
    "also note that if we work in dimensionless units , scaling all lengths by @xmath33 , then the lensing properties of the dark matter halos depend only on the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath30 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we compute lensing cross sections using monte carlo methods . working in dimensionless",
    "coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we pick random sources and use the _ gravlens _ software by @xcite to solve the lens equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : multi ] shows examples of the three different kinds of image configurations : double , quadruple , and naked cusp lenses .",
    "we count the number of sources that produce lenses of different image multiplicities to determine the dimensionless cross sections @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for doubles , quadruples , and cusps , respectively . for each set of images",
    ", we define the dimensionless image separation @xmath40 to be the maximum separation between any pair of images ; this is a convenient definition that depends only on observable quantities and is well defined for all image configurations ( no matter how many images there are ) .",
    "we bin the sources by the image separations they produce to derive image separation distributions , as shown in figures  [ fig : dist_theta_a100 ] and [ fig : dist_theta_a150 ] . for a given halo",
    "there is a range of separations , but it tends to be fairly narrow ( @xmath4120% ) ; the main exception is for cusp configurations , which show a tail to small separations that corresponds to sources near the cusp in the caustic .",
    "if we not only count the sources but also weight them appropriately , we can compute the magnification bias . specifically , if the sources have a simple power law luminosity function @xmath42 then the `` biased cross section '' can be written as @xmath43 where the integral is over the multiply - imaged region of the source plane .",
    "we can compute the biased cross sections for doubles , quadruples , and cusps similarly .",
    "each source is to be weighted by @xmath44 , where we take @xmath45 to be the magnification of the second brightest image to reflect the method of searching for large - separation lenses in observational data such as the sdss ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important qualitative result is already apparent from figure  [ fig : multi ] .",
    "cdm - type dark matter halos are very sensitive to departures from spherical symmetry , in the sense that even small projected ellipticities lead to large tangential caustics and hence large quadruple cross sections .",
    "when the ellipticity is large , the tangential caustic is much larger than the radial caustic and nearly all the images correspond to cusp configurations .",
    "this situation is notably different from what happens in lensing by galaxies that have concentrated , roughly isothermal mass distributions . in that case",
    ", the ellipticity must approach unity before cusp configurations become common ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such large ellipticities are uncommon , and cusp configurations are correspondingly rare among observed galaxy - scale lenses : among @xmath080 known lenses there is only one candidate ( apm  08279 + 5255 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the incidence of cusp configurations therefore appears to be a significant distinction between normal and large - separation lenses .",
    "the probability that a source at redshift @xmath46 is lensed into a system with image separation @xmath47 is computed by summing the biased cross section over an appropriate population of lens halos : @xmath48_{m(\\theta)}.     \\label{eq : prob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first integral is over the volume between the observer and the source .",
    "the next three integrals are over the structural parameters of the lens halos , while the last two integrals cover the different orientations .",
    "the mass function of dark matter halos is @xmath49 , and we use the model from equation ( b3 ) of @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath50 is the mass of a halo that produces image separation @xmath47 ( for given redshift and other parameters ) , which is given by the solution of @xmath51 the square brackets in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) indicate that the integrand is to be evaluated only for parameter sets that produce the desired image separation . equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) gives the total lensing probability , but we can simply replace the total biased cross section @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 to compute the probability for doubles , quadruples , or cusps .",
    "we use the model given by js02 for the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) that appear in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "the pdfs for the axis ratios are : @xmath56^{0.7}}-0.54\\right\\}^2}{2(0.113)^2}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-30mm}\\times\\left(\\frac{m_{\\rm vir}}{m_*}\\right)^{0.07[\\omega(z)]^{0.7 } } , \\label{p_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath57 , \\label{p_ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the characteristic nonlinear mass such that the rms top - hat - smoothed overdensity at that mass scale is @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath58 and @xmath60 depend on redshift , so @xmath61 varies with redshift such that halos tend to be more triaxial at higher redshifts ( see fig .",
    "8 of js02 ) .",
    "also note that @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the pdf for the concentration parameter is @xmath64\\frac{1}{c_e}. \\label{p_ce}\\ ] ] for the median concentration parameter @xmath65 , we adopt a fitting formula given by js02 ( see also ols03 ) : @xmath66^{0.7}}}\\right\\}^2\\right]&&\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-50mm}\\times a_e\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta_{\\rm vir}(z_c)}{\\delta_{\\rm vir}(z)}}\\left(\\frac{1+z_c}{1+z}\\right)^{3/2 } , \\label{ce}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 being the collapse redshift of the halo of mass @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the lambda - dominated cdm model ( js02 ) . for spherical halos ,",
    "large - separation lens statistics are highly sensitive to the concentration distribution ( both the median and the scatter ; see * ? ? ?",
    "however , we checked that in the triaxial model the sensitivity is much reduced because there is such a broad distribution of axis ratios ; hence we do not present results with a different median or scatter in the concentration distribution .",
    "finally , the pdfs for the orientation angles are @xmath70 corresponding to random 3-d orientations .",
    "we begin by examining how the lensing probabilities and image multiplicities vary when we change the degree of triaxiality .",
    "we remove the integral over @xmath22 in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) to compute the lensing probabilities at fixed triaxiality ( we still integrate over the intermediate axis ratio @xmath23 and over random orientations ) .",
    "we can then plot the probabilities as a function of @xmath22 , as shown in figure  [ fig : afix ] . in this example",
    ", we place the source at redshift @xmath71 , and we use a source luminosity function with slope @xmath72 .",
    "we compute the probabilities for an image separation of @xmath73 , similar to that of the one known large - separation lensed quasar sdss j1004 + 4112 @xcite .    for @xmath74",
    "we recover the spherical case .",
    "as @xmath22 decreases ( the triaxiality increases ) , at first the total lensing probability stays roughly constant but the fraction of quadruples rises ; this is similar to the effects of ellipticity on isothermal lenses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then the probability for naked cusp image configurations begins to rise dramatically , and they come to dominate the total probability .",
    "interestingly , the sum of the probabilities for quadruple and double lenses is roughly equal to the probability for spherical halos for most values of @xmath22 , at least for this example with image separation @xmath73 ( also see figures  [ fig : sep][fig : zs ] below ) .",
    "this suggests that the enhancement in the total lensing probability is mainly driven by naked cusp configurations .",
    "the @xmath5 and 1.5 cases both have these qualitative features , and they differ only in the quantitative details . since the typical triaxiality in cdm simulations is @xmath75 ( js02 ) , it appears that triaxiality can have a significant effect on the statistics of large - separation lenses .      to compute the full impact of triaxiality on lens statistics",
    ", we must integrate over an appropriate triaxiality distribution ( as in equation [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sep ] shows the resulting lensing probabilities and image multiplicities as a function of the image separation @xmath47 .",
    "again , we place the source quasar at @xmath71 , and fix the slope of the source luminosity function to @xmath72 .",
    "the first important result is that the triaxial model predicts larger lensing probabilities than the spherical model for all image separations .",
    "the enhancement is a factor of @xmath04 for @xmath5 , and a factor of @xmath02 for @xmath6 , if the image separation is not so large ( @xmath76 ) . at larger separations",
    "it seems that the effect of triaxiality is even more significant , especially for @xmath5 ; we will discuss this issue in ",
    "[ sec : largesep ] .",
    "there are several interesting results in the image multiplicities .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath77 cases have very different multiplicities : with @xmath5 the lensing probability is dominated by cusp configurations ; while with @xmath6 quadruple lenses are somewhat more common than cusps .",
    "neither result is very sensitive to the image separation . in both cases double lenses",
    "are fairly uncommon , which is very different from the situation with normal arcsecond - scale lenses produced by nearly - isothermal galaxies .",
    "this result is consistent with previous theoretical conclusions that image multiplicities depend on the central concentration of the lens mass distribution , such that less concentrated profiles tend to produce more quadruple and cusp lenses ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the important point for observations is that if dark halos have inner profiles with @xmath1 , then many or even most large - separation lenses should be quadruples or cusps rather than doubles .",
    "( we will consider the implications for sdss j1004 + 4112 in  [ sec : sdss ] . )",
    "another point is that the image multiplicities are sensitive to the inner density profile , so they offer a new method for probing dark matter density profiles that is qualitatively different from methods discussed before .",
    "magnification bias is important in lens statistics , particularly in image multiplicities , because it gives more weight to quadruple and cusp configurations ( which tend to have large magnifications ) than to doubles .",
    "we should therefore understand what happens when we modify the magnification bias by varying the slope @xmath78 of the source luminosity function .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : bias ] ( for image separation @xmath73 and source redshift @xmath71 ) .",
    "the lensing probabilities increase as @xmath78 increases , because as the source luminosity function becomes steeper magnification bias becomes stronger .",
    ", so we are restricted to shallower cases .",
    "] interestingly , the increase in the total probability due to triaxiality weakens as @xmath78 increases , although the effect is not strong .",
    "as for the image multiplicities , @xmath5 halos are always dominated by cusp lenses , although for sufficiently steep luminosity functions quadruples become fairly common . with @xmath6 halos , when magnification bias is weak ( @xmath79 ) doubles are the most probable , but as magnification bias strengthens ( @xmath78 increases ) quadruples receive more weight and become the most likely . in practice ,",
    "the effective values of @xmath78 are larger than @xmath01.5 for both optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radio surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we expect cusps to dominate for @xmath5 and quadruples to be the most common for @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we consider whether the results depend on the source redshift , as shown in figure  [ fig : zs ] .",
    "the lensing probabilities rise with @xmath46 , because there is more volume and hence more deflectors between the observer and the source .",
    "in addition , geometric effects mean that a given halo can produce a larger image separation when the source is more distant , so the halo mass required to produce a given image separation goes down and the abundance of relevant deflectors goes up .",
    "however , the probability increase affects the different image configurations in basically the same way , so the image multiplicities are quite insensitive to the source redshift .",
    "therefore , we conclude that details of the source redshift distribution are not so important for image multiplicities , at least when the source luminosity function has a power law shape .      in figure",
    "[ fig : sep ] , at very large image separations ( @xmath80 ) the lensing probabilities in the triaxial halo model are orders of magnitude larger than those in the spherical halo model .",
    "in addition , at these very large separations the @xmath5 case produces higher probabilities than the more concentrated @xmath6 case .",
    "both features are puzzling and invite careful consideration .",
    "figure  [ fig : amin ] shows the dependence of total lensing probability on the lower limit of the integral over @xmath22 . in the previous calculations , we assumed @xmath81 .",
    "this figure shows that for @xmath73 the results are quite insensitive to @xmath82 , suggesting that the contribution from extremely triaxial halos is negligible . for @xmath83",
    ", however , the lensing probability rapidly decreases as @xmath82 increases .",
    "in other words , the lensing probability at very large image separations seems to be dominated by very small @xmath22 , or very large triaxialities .",
    "results that are dominated by such extreme halos are probably not very reliable .",
    "they depend sensitively on both the assumed pdf for the axis ratio @xmath22 ( eq .  [ [ p_a ] ] ) and",
    "the correlation between @xmath22 and the concentration @xmath84 ( eq .  [ [ ce ] ] ) at very small axis ratios .",
    "the fitting forms presented by js02 were intended to reproduce the pdf and correlation at @xmath85 , and it is unclear whether they are still accurate at @xmath86 . in addition , even if we know accurate fitting forms , such a situation implies that sample variance ( i.e. , the effect of the finite number of lensing clusters ) may be quite large .",
    "another ambiguity is the projection effect . in this paper",
    ", we assumed that the density profile ( eq .  [ [ gnfw ] ] ) extends beyond the virial radius , and in projecting along the line of sight we integrated the profile to infinity .",
    "although it is not clear whether we should cut off the profile at the virial radius or not ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effect of the extended profile on the gravitational lensing is not so large for normal dark halos . however ,",
    "when @xmath22 is small enough , equation ( [ ce ] ) indicates that the concentration parameter @xmath84 becomes smaller than unity , so the effect of the extended profile outside the virial radius is quite significant . the puzzling feature that the @xmath5 case produces higher probabilities than the @xmath6 case at very large separations can be ascribed to the projection effect , because the effect is more significant for shallower density profiles .",
    "thus , lenses with extremely large image separations are associated with the most extreme dark matter halos , and it may be difficult to make reliable predictions about them .",
    "we emphasize , though , that these issues do not apply to lenses with separations @xmath87 , and on these scales we believe our results to be robust .",
    "in the previous section , we assumed a simple power law source luminosity function to understand the general effects of triaxiality .",
    "here we consider a specific luminosity function appropriate for quasars , and further customize our predictions to quasars in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "we adopt the double power law @xmath88-band luminosity function for quasars proposed by @xcite , @xmath89^{\\beta_l}+[l / l_*(z_{\\rm s})]^{\\beta_h}}\\frac{dl}{l_*(z_{\\rm s})},\\ ] ] and use @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we let the break luminosity evolve following a model that reproduces the low - redshift luminosity function as well as the space density of high - redshift quasars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in practice we actually use the cumulative luminosity function @xmath92 to calculate the biased cross section ( see  [ sec : cross ] ) @xmath93 we approximate that the sdss quasar sample is a sample with a flux limit of @xmath94 .",
    "@xcite . however , we assume a flux limit of @xmath94 because there are quasars with @xmath95 in the sdss quasar sample which are , for example , first targeted as different objects but revealed to be quasars . ]",
    "one needs a cross - filter k - correction to convert observed @xmath96 magnitudes to absolute @xmath88-band luminosity .",
    "we adopt the following form @xmath97 with @xmath98 @xcite . finally , we approximate the redshift distribution ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) with the following gaussian distribution :",
    "@xmath99 we have confirmed that the results using these approximations agree well with those obtained by fully taking account of the observed redshift and magnitude distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : sdss_sep ] shows the lensing probabilities and image multiplicities as a function of image separation @xmath47 for the sdss quasar sample .",
    "again large - separation lenses are dominated by cusp configurations for @xmath5 , but all three configurations are almost equally likely for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we confirm that image multiplicities in sdss large - separation lenses will offer interesting information on the density profile of dark halos",
    ". we can now consider whether it is statistically natural that the first large - separation lens in the sdss is a quadruple lens .",
    "we find that for an image separation @xmath73 the fractions of quadruple lenses are @xmath00.2 and @xmath00.4 for @xmath5 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath6 could explain the discovery of the quadruple lens somewhat better , but @xmath5 is also not unnatural .",
    "finally , we can use the discovery of sdss j1004 + 4112 , together with the lack of large - separation lenses in the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to constrain the cosmological parameter @xmath100 describing the normalization of the density fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "using spherical models , @xcite found that the discovery of sdss j1004 + 4112 required rather large values of either @xmath4 or @xmath100 , but given the importance of triaxiality we should revisit this question .",
    "for the sdss , we compute the expected number of large - separation lenses with @xmath101 among the 29811 sdss quasars . for class ,",
    "we adopt a power law source luminosity function with @xmath102 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fix the source redshift to @xmath103 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and calculate the expected number of lenses with @xmath104 among 9284 flat - spectrum radio sources @xcite .",
    "we then compute the likelihood @xmath105 which represents the poisson probability of observing no large - separation lenses in class when @xmath106 are expected , and at least one large - separation lens in sdss when @xmath107 are expected .",
    "( there may be other large - separation lenses in the sdss sample that have not yet been identified . )",
    "we consider two possibilities for the expected number of lenses in the sdss : ( 1 ) the total number of lenses @xmath108 is used as @xmath107 ; ( 2 ) only the number of quadruple lenses @xmath109 is because the discovered lens is quadruple .",
    "figure  [ fig : s8 ] shows the resulting maximum likelihood constraints on @xmath100 .",
    "we find that @xmath110 explains the data well , although the details depend on the value of @xmath4 and the choice of @xmath107 .",
    "only the case with @xmath5 and @xmath111 prefers relatively large @xmath100 , but @xmath112 is still allowed at the 2@xmath113 level . at present",
    "the data do not allow particularly strong constraints on @xmath100 .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that the status large - separation lenses is quite consistent with the predictions of cdm given @xmath110 .    for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : s8 ] also shows results for spherical halos .",
    "it turns out that the spherical model overestimates the value of @xmath100 by @xmath00.1 for @xmath5 and @xmath00.2 for @xmath6 , compared with cases where we take @xmath114 .",
    "triaxiality is therefore an important systematic effect in these cases .",
    "interestingly , the best - fit values of @xmath100 from spherical models are quite similar to those from triaxial models with @xmath115 . in both cases , the likelihood function for the spherical model is narrower than for the triaxial model , indicating that the spherical model would underestimate the statistical uncertainties in @xmath100 .",
    "the dark matter halos predicted by the cdm model are triaxial rather than spherical , which has a significant effect on the statistics of large - separation gravitational lenses .",
    "triaxiality systematically enhances the lensing probability by a factor of @xmath04 if dark halos have an inner density profile with @xmath5 , or a factor of @xmath02 if @xmath6",
    ". the effects may be even more dramatic at very large image separations ( @xmath116 ) , although such lenses are very sensitive to the most triaxial halos and so the predictions are not as reliable .",
    "thus , triaxiality must be added to the list of important systematic effects that need to be included in calculations of large - separation lens statistics .",
    "( some of the other effects are the inner density profile and the shape of the distribution of concentration parameters , as found by previous studies of large - separation lens statistics using spherical halos . )",
    "triaxial modeling allows us to predict the image multiplicities for large - separation lenses .",
    "we found that the multiplicities depend strongly on the density profile : for @xmath5 , lenses are dominated by naked cusp image configurations ; while for @xmath6 , quadruple configurations are the most probable .",
    "double lenses , which are dominant among normal arcsecond - scale lenses , are subdominant in both cases .",
    "note that cusp lenses can be distinguished from doubles by the presence of a third image comparable in brightness to the other two , and by the configuration of image positions .",
    "the differences can be ascribed to the different mass density profiles , and they indicate that the multiplicities of large - separation lenses will provide a qualitatively new probe of the central density profiles of massive dark matter halos ( and hence a new test of cdm ) .",
    "we have computed lensing probabilities and image multiplicities for the sdss quasar sample .",
    "we predict that for both @xmath5 and @xmath77 most of the large - separation lenses should be quadruples or cusps .",
    "the fractions of quadruple lenses at separations of @xmath73 are @xmath00.2 and @xmath00.4 for @xmath5 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the first large - separation lens discovered is a quadruple .",
    "in addition , we computed the expected number of large - separation lenses in both sdss and class , and found that the data are consistent with the cdm model with @xmath110 , in agreement with other measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the discovery of sdss j1004 + 4112 can be interpreted as additional support for cdm on non - linear cluster scales .",
    "the prediction that triaxial halos produce significant fractions of quadruple and cusp lenses should be kept in mind when considering samples of candidate large - separation lenses .",
    "for example , @xcite found six large - separation double lens candidates in the 2df quasar redshift survey , but no quadruple or cusp lens candidates . even accounting for small number statistics ,",
    "our results suggest that such a high fraction of doubles would be inconsistent with cdm at more than 3@xmath113 , , then the poisson probability of having @xmath117 doubles and no quadruples or cusps is @xmath118 . ] and that it would be surprising if many of the six candidates are genuine lens systems .",
    "we note that the triaxial dark halo model we adopted in this paper can be improved in several ways .",
    "first , we assumed that the axis ratios of the triaxial ellipsoids are constant with radius .",
    "however , js02 showed that the axis ratios decrease slightly toward the halo centers : @xmath22 decreases by @xmath119 as the mean radius decreases from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "since strong lensing is most sensitive to the inner parts of dark halos , it is possible that we have actually underestimated the effects of triaxiality on the statistics of large - separation lenses . on the other hand , including baryons ( which were neglected in the simulations of js02 ) would tend to make dark halos rounder by @xmath122@xmath123 because of the isotropic gas pressure .    while our theoretical model is much more realistic than the simple spherical model , we have still made several simplifying assumptions .",
    "one is that we have neglected substructure in dark halos .",
    "the galaxies in massive cluster halos do not have a large effect on the statistics of lensed arcs @xcite , but it is not obvious whether or not they would affect large - separation lenses .",
    "substructure can affect the image multiplicities for isothermal lenses @xcite , so it should be considered for cdm halos as well .",
    "another effect we have neglected is the presence of a massive central galaxy in a cluster .",
    "@xcite claim that central galaxies do not have a large effect on arc statistics .",
    "however , because our results depend on the inner slope of the density profile , and a central galaxy effectively increases the concentration , this effect should be considered . a third phenomenon we have neglected is cluster merger events .",
    "indeed , mergers can change the shapes of critical curves and caustics substantially , and thus have a great impact on lensing cross sections @xcite . to estimate the effect on large - separation lens statistics ,",
    "we would need a realistic model of the cluster merger event rate and the physical conditions of merger events .",
    "addressing these various issues to improve the accuracy of the theoretical predictions is beyond the scope of this paper , but is certainly of interest for future work .",

    "<S> we study the statistics of large - separation gravitational lens systems produced by non - spherical halos in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we examine how the triaxiality of cdm halos affects the overall lensing probabilities and the relative numbers of different image configurations ( double , quadruple , and naked cusp lenses ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that triaxiality significantly enhances lensing probabilities by a factor of @xmath024 , so it can not be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> if cdm halos have central density slopes @xmath1 , we predict that a significant fraction ( @xmath220% ) of large - separation lenses should have naked cusp image configurations ; this contrasts with lensing by isothermal ( @xmath3 ) galaxies where naked cusp configurations are rare . </S>",
    "<S> the image multiplicities depend strongly on the inner density slope @xmath4 : for @xmath5 , the naked cusp fraction is @xmath260% ; while for @xmath6 , quadruple lenses are actually the most probable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the image multiplicities in large - separation lenses offer a simple new probe of the inner density profiles of dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the expected probabilities and image multiplicities for lensed quasars in the sloan digital sky survey , and argue that the recent discovery of the large - separation quadruple lens sdss j1004 + 4112 is consistent with expectations for cdm . </S>"
