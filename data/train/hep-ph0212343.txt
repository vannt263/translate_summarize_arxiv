    "inclusive jet cross sections have a long history , and the agreement of predictions based on perturbative qcd with experiment is often impressive . the study of energy flow into the regions between energetic jets @xcite gives important , and in some sense complementary information about the formation of final states .",
    "interjet energy flow is expected to reflect the flow of color at short distances @xcite and may give insight into the hadronization process .",
    "in addition , knowledge of the relation between energy and color flows is important for investigating hard collisions @xcite , to distinguish qcd bremsstrahlung originating in the underlying hard scattering or decay from radiation induced by multiple scatterings .",
    "the study of observables in jet events that test the flow of energy is thus of considerable interest .",
    "the computation of such observables , however , has turned out to be subtle @xcite , for reasons that we will briefly review below . for definiteness",
    ", we will discuss these issues in dijet events at large center - of - mass energy @xmath3 in @xmath2-annihilation @xcite . in this case",
    "the underlying color flow at short distances is unique , corresponding to the creation of a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this enables us to illustrate our method , while avoiding the complication of multiple color exchanges , for example , singlet and octet exchange in quark - antiquark scattering @xcite .",
    "we study the flow of energy or transverse energy , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , into an interjet angular region , @xmath1 . the process @xmath6 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ eventfig ] .",
    "@xmath7 represents soft radiation into the region between @xmath1 and the jet axes , denoted by @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes soft radiation into @xmath1 .",
    "our goal is to relate soft radiation into region @xmath1 to the hard scattering that produces the jets .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to observables as  non - global \" when they are defined by radiation into a specific portion of phase space , while remaining more - or - less inclusive elsewhere . in non - global cross sections",
    "there are two sources of logarithmic corrections , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ eventfig ] : `` primary '' emissions , such as gluon 1 in fig .",
    "[ eventfig ] , are emitted directly from the hard partons into @xmath1 .",
    "phase space integrals for these emissions contribute single logarithms per loop : @xmath10 .",
    "these logarithms exponentiate , and may be resummed in a straightforward fashion @xcite",
    ". there are also  secondary \" emissions originating from the complementary region @xmath8 , illustrated by configuration 2 in fig .",
    "[ eventfig ] .",
    "as emphasized by dasgupta and salam @xcite , emissions into @xmath1 from such secondary partons can give logarithms of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the maximum energy of radiation in @xmath8 .",
    "these have become known as non - global logarithms .",
    "if no restriction is placed on the radiation into @xmath8 , then @xmath12 can approach @xmath3 , and the non - global , secondary logarithms can become as important as the primary logarithms .",
    "the non - global logarithms arise because real and virtual enhancements associated with secondary emissions do not cancel each other fully at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "in general , such non - global logarithms , as studied in @xcite and @xcite , are sensitive to color flow at all scales and in all directions , and they do not exponentiate in the same simple manner as do logarithmic enhancements from primary emission . in a sense , they mask the underlying color exchange at short distances .    in the studies of non - global observables in refs .",
    "@xcite , numerical estimates of both types of logarithms were carried out in various situations . here",
    "we will adopt a somewhat different strategy , and introduce correlations between energy flow and event shapes ( `` flow / shape correlations '' ) .",
    "our aim is to select final states whose formation is sensitive primarily to radiation from the highest - energy jets . by restricting the range of event shapes , we can systematically limit radiation in region @xmath8 while retaining the chosen jet structure .",
    "this allows us to treat all leading effects analytically .",
    "in essence , the color and energy flow originating from the primary radiation is less obstructed by secondary radiation .",
    "our approach does not resum non - global logarithms , but allows us to address the question of interjet energy flow within a more global context , while retaining the original motivation and physical picture described above .",
    "the following observation allows us to avoid leading contributions from non - global configurations such as gluon 2 in fig .",
    "[ eventfig ] .",
    "large non - global logarithms originate from emissions into @xmath13 at relatively large angles from the jets , because radiation from partons close to the jet directions is emitted coherently . by fixing the value of an event shape near the two - jet limit",
