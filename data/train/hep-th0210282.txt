    "since the classical work @xcite of h.b.g .",
    "casimir , where the energy of vacuum polarized by two conducting planes was calculated , a number of similar problems was investigated for various external conditions ( boundary conditions , background potentials etc . ) , see , for example , the recent review @xcite or the books @xcite .",
    "no general rule for the dependence of the vacuum energy on the background properties has been found so far . in particular , it is unknown how to forecast the sign of the energy .",
    "an interesting problem is the calculation of the vacuum energy of a spinor field in the background of a magnetic field .",
    "this problem was first considered as early as in 1936 by w. heisenberg and h. euler @xcite who were interested in the effective action in the background of a homogeneous magnetic field .    presently",
    ", the interest is shifted to string like configurations . in @xcite",
    "the contribution of the fermionic ground state energy to the stability of electro weak strings was addressed . in @xcite",
    "the gluonic ground state energy in the background of a center - of - group vortex in qcd had been considered .",
    "a very special inhomogeneous reflectionless magnetic background is for example the model for domain wall @xcite . in this case , the equation for the vacuum fluctuations was easy to solve analytically .",
    "however , the final expression for the effective action involves an additional integration over a momentum , thus bringing no real simplifications .    in qed , for",
    "the background of a flux tube with constant magnetic field inside the ground state energy was calculated in @xcite .",
    "here it turned out to be negative remaining of course much smaller than the classical energy of the background field .",
    "an interesting approach is that used in @xcite where the issue of the sign and of bounds on fermionic determinants in a magnetic background had been considered .",
    "the remarkably simple case of a magnetic background field concentrated on a cylindrical shell ( i.e. , a delta function shaped profile ) was considered in @xcite . here",
    "different signs of the vacuum energy turned out to be possible in dependence on the parameters ( radius and flux ) .    in general , the issue of stability of the strings is of interest . in electro",
    "weak theory , and in qed in particular , the coupling is small . hence the vacuum energy as being a one loop correction to the classical energy",
    "is suppressed by this coupling . while in qed",
    "a magnetic string is intrinsically unstable , in electro weak theory there are unstable and stable configuration known @xcite . here",
    "quantum corrections may become important for the stability .",
    "a question of special interest is whether a strong or singular background may have a quantum vacuum energy comparable to the classical one .    for the calculation of ground state energy ,",
    "it is necessary to subtract the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this procedure is in general well known and we follow * ? ? ?",
    "roughly speaking one has to subtract the contribution of the first few heat kernel coefficients ( @xmath0 through @xmath1 in the given case of ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ) .",
    "after that one can remove the intermediate regularization and one is left with finite expressions . however , in order to obtain these finite expressions in a form suitable for numerical calculations one has to go one more step . as described in",
    "* , see also below in section 2 , one has to add and to subtract of a certain part of the asymptotic expansion of the integrand .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the analysis done in @xcite to a rectangular shaped magnetic background field .",
    "so we consider the vacuum energy of a spinor field in qed for a background as given by eqs .",
    "( [ fieldb ] , [ h_r1 ] ) .",
    "this problem is technically more involved and allows progress in two directions .",
    "first , it allows to refine the mathematical and numerical tools for such problems and , second , it allows to address the question how the vacuum energy behaves for an increasingly singular background ( making the rectangle narrower ) .",
    "so this model interpolates to some extend between the flux tube with homogeneous field inside in @xcite and the delta shaped one in @xcite .",
    "the basic principles of this procedure are described briefly in sec .",
    "namely it starts with the well known zeta functional regularization .",
    "the regularized ground state energy is represented as a zeta function of a hamiltonian spectrum and treated in termini of heat kernel expansion .",
    "the representation of regularized ground state energy as an integral of the logarithmic derivative of the jost function for spinor wave scattering problem on the external magnetic background is obtained .",
    "the jost function is obtained from the exact solutions of dirac equation , derived in sec .",
    "the explicit form of the exact and asymptotic jost function is considered in sec .",
    "4 . in sec.5 the representation useful for further numerical evaluations is derived .",
    "6 is devoted to the calculation of the heat kernel coefficient @xmath2 and the sec .",
    "7 contains some numerical evaluations of the ground state energy .",
    "the divergent part is identified as that part of the corresponding heat kernel expansion which does not vanish for large @xmath3 ( mass of the quantum spinor field ) .",
    "after the subtraction of this divergent part the remaining analytical expression must be transformed in order to lift the regularization .",
    "a part of the uniform asymptotic expansion of the jost function is used for this procedure .",
    "finally the analytical expression for the ground state energy has been evaluated numerically .    throughout the paper @xmath4",
    "consider a spinor field on a magnetic background @xmath5 of the form + @xmath6 where @xmath7 is constant defining the magnetic flux , @xmath8 is a unit vector in the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "we use the zeta - function regularization for the vacuum energy @xmath17 . since the background is static , the following representation holds , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are eigenfrequences resp .",
    "eigenvalues of energy for one particle states , ( the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian , see the next section ) , @xmath20 is a parameter with the dimension of mass which is introduced to keep the correct dimension of energy in this expression .    for technical reasons",
    "we assume that the system is contained in a large but finite cylinder of radius @xmath21 in order to have discrete eigenvalues in the transversal directions .",
    "because of the translational invariance along the z - axis we can separate the @xmath22-component of momentum , @xmath23 here is it necessary to remark that @xmath17 has the meaning of density per unit length . integrating out @xmath24 we get @xmath25 in this expression a factor 4 resulting from the summation over spin states and over the sign of the one particle energies appeared . the remaining sum over @xmath26 is over the eigenvalues @xmath27 of a two dimensional wave equation for one mode in the perpendicular plane .",
    "the further transformation of this expression is described more detailed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first step is based on the property of logarithmic derivative of eigenfunctions with respect to momentum k. the contour integral , @xmath28 is equal to the sum over the spectrum , @xmath29 , if the contour @xmath30 encircles the real positive axis .",
    "then ( [ e0sumk ] ) becomes @xmath31 here @xmath32 are the eigenfunctions of hamiltonian @xmath33 labeled by the orbital momentum @xmath34 .    in the present formalism instead of",
    "wave functions @xmath32 we use the corresponding jost functions @xmath35 which contain all necessary informations on the spectrum of scattering problem . for the space domain outside of cylindrical magnetic background , at @xmath36 ,",
    "the wave functions can be chosen as a linear composition of hankel functions @xmath37,\\\\",
    "\\label{jost_lk}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath35 are the corresponding jost functions .    now after the subtraction of contribution from empty minkowski space ( identified as the term divergent at @xmath39 , which is independent of the background and corresponds to the heat kernel coefficient @xmath0,([a_0 ] ) below ) , and rotation of the path towards the imaginary positive axis one obtains @xcite @xmath40 which is a very useful representation of the regularized ground state energy .",
    "a merit of this representation is the absence of oscillations of the integrand for large arguments ( [ e0_of_lnf ] ) . in the considered problem",
    "bound states appear if the flux is larger than one flux unit . strictly speaking ,",
    "these are zero modes located on the lower end of the continuous spectrum , i.e. at k=0 ( this is known from @xcite ) . ] .    to discuss divergences in @xmath17 we need a more general setting .",
    "@xmath41 can be expressed through the zeta - function of the associated differential operator @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 admits an integral representation @xmath45 where the kernel of this integral representation @xmath46 is the so called heat kernel .",
    "the associated `` heat kernel expansion '' for the kernel @xmath47 of this integral representation at @xmath48 is @xcite @xmath49 in accordance to the heat kernel expansion , the coefficients @xmath50 occurred in ( [ heat_kt_sum ] ) must be for our background @xcite : @xmath51 is simple an ( infinite ) volume of configuration space ; the part proportional to it has been even dropped before during the renormalization procedure as a contribution of the empty minkowski space .",
    "all other coefficients up to @xmath1 for this background must be zero through dimensional reasons and requirement of gauge invariance , ( for details see the paper @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath52 the first nonzero coefficient is known to read @xmath53 and only the term with @xmath54 contributes to the `` divergent '' part of energy @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it will be shown below that only the contribution proportional to @xmath1 in @xmath41 contains a simple pole at @xmath55 and in the case of pure magnetic background is proportional to the classical energy @xmath56    in the paper @xcite it has been found , that the regularized ground state energy of the magnetic flux tube of finite radius @xmath21 behaves as @xmath57 at @xmath58 which corresponds to the contribution proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "it holds in accordance to the observed fact that in the case of non - smooth backgrounds the heat kernel coefficients with half - integer number starting from some value corresponding to the smoothness - class of the background are different from zero .",
    "it occurs namely in our case , where the background potential @xmath11 is continous and the magnetic field @xmath59 has a discontinuity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 is nonzero in our case , see below sec.6 .",
    "the next terms of this asymptotic may be @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath61 , and @xmath62 delivering terms @xmath63 .",
    "we define the renormalized ground state energy as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is obtained from the heat kernel expansion ( [ heat_kt_sum ] ) and @xmath66 fulfills the normalization condition @xcite @xmath67 inserting the heat kernel expansion ( [ heat_kt_sum ] ) into the zeta function and using ( [ e0_zeta ] ) we have @xmath68 where @xmath1 is the only non - zero heat kernel coefficient @xmath69 , contributing to the divergent part of vacuum energy .    for the renormalized ground state energy the asymptotical dependence on powers of @xmath3 at @xmath70 follows from eq.([heat_kt_sum ] ) to have the form @xmath71 with some coefficients @xmath72 .",
    "in accordance with the interpretation of @xmath73 it must vanish in the limit of @xmath70 since it is the energy of vacuum fluctuations . through the subtraction of terms containing all non - negative powers of @xmath74 ( which are the terms of heat kernel expansion up to @xmath1 ) the condition ( [ norm_cond ] ) is satisfied automatically .",
    "some comments on the subtraction scheme are in order .",
    "this scheme is motivated by the physical assumption that the quantum fluctuations should vanish if the mass of the fluctuating field becomes large .",
    "the scheme had been used in a number of casimir energy calculations .",
    "in @xcite it had been shown to be equivalent to the so called `` no tadpole '' normalization condition which is common in field theory .",
    "it should be noticed that this scheme does not apply to massless fluctuating fields , for a discussion of this point see @xcite .",
    "so @xmath66 as given by eq.([e0-ediv])is now finite at @xmath75 but it is not possible to use this expression immediately since the integral in this limit does not exist ; i.e. one can not carry out the analytical continuation to @xmath76 .",
    "in order to get a representation where this can be done one can make a trick @xcite , namely add and subtract a part @xmath77 of the uniform asymptotical expansion for @xmath78 in ( [ e0_of_lnf ] ) containing a minimal number of terms to provide the convergence of the remaining part after the subtraction .",
    "thus we can separate the resulting expression into four terms @xmath79 where @xmath80 and redefine two terms in brackets as @xmath81 thus @xmath82 is defined to be @xmath83 \\label{ef_pure}\\ ] ] the `` finite '' part @xmath82 of the renormalized vacuum energy is not only well defined at @xmath84 , but also provides a representation well suited for numerical analysis . the analytical continuation for @xmath85 at this limit",
    "will be constructed below .",
    "we consider a spinor quantum field @xmath86 in the background of the classical magnetic flux .",
    "we start with the dirac equation for this field @xmath87 with the electromagnetic potential ( [ potential_a ] ) .",
    "the @xmath86 in ( [ dirac_eq ] ) is a spinor quantum field of mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath88 , interacting with @xmath89 ( [ potential_a ] ) .",
    "the gamma matrices in our representation are chosen to be the same as in @xcite @xmath90 now we follow the standard procedure and separate the variables . using the ansatz @xmath91 we obtain the equation for the 4- component spinor @xmath92 $ ] @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 are the two - component spinors .    respecting the translational invariance of the system it is sufficient to solve the equations only for @xmath96 .",

    "although the general analysis of @xcite is valid for our background , an explicit expression for @xmath2 has not been calculated yet .",
    "we can use our obtained jost function ( [ f_v_of_ik ] ) to calculate the coefficient @xmath2 in the heat kernel expansion ( [ heat_kt_sum ] ) .",
    "suppose we have obtained the value of @xmath41 ( [ e0_of_lnf])in the point @xmath176 .",
    "it follows from ( [ e0_zeta ] - [ heat_kt_sum ] ) that @xmath177 and at the limit of @xmath178 only the term containing @xmath2 remains to be nonzero in the sum .",
    "from the other hand we have ( [ e0_of_lnf ] , [ e0_of_lnfas ] ) @xmath180 here we substitute the exact jost function by its uniform asymptotic represented in the form @xmath181 where the coefficients @xmath182 are functions of @xmath183 , @xmath184 , the power @xmath151 is absent , as noticed above ( [ lnfas ] ) , @xmath185 at the limit @xmath178 it yields @xmath186 and therefore we obtain for @xmath2 @xmath187    to obtain the explicit form of @xmath188 we use the uniform asymptotic expansion of the jost function ( [ unif_as_h ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath189 in [ unif_as_f ] can be obtained either by iterations of lippmann - schwinger equation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) or by using the explicit form of the jost function as well .",
    "all the further terms up from @xmath190 are produced from the explicit form of the jost function ( [ f_v_of_ik ] ) because of complication of the first way for higher orders @xmath191 ( see the remark to [ lnfas ] in sec.6 ) .",
    "namely , we obtain several higher orders @xmath192 of uniform asymptotic expansion for special functions @xmath193 which the exact jost function ( [ f_v_of_ik ] ) consists of ( it can be done starting with the explicit form for two first orders and executing the recursive algorithm several times@xcite ) , then after substitution of each of functions @xmath194 by its corresponding uniform asymptotic expansion and separation of powers of @xmath103 we arrive at the form ( [ unif_as_h ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath195 are given in the appendix ( [ unif_as_h ] ) .",
    "if the function @xmath196 is a polynomial over @xmath197 , so we can consider some term @xmath198 of it .",
    "notice , that for @xmath199 it is not the case , but we can treat the terms of kind @xmath200 and @xmath201 , @xmath134-integer , as an infinite sum of powers @xmath202 .",
    "apart from the construction of @xmath203 ( [ unif_as_f ] ) they are strictly positive and less than 1 , therefore the series @xmath204 converges regular and uniform and respecting that we have only finite integer powers @xmath134 so that @xmath205^k=   \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{\\infty}t^i\\right)^k $ ] converges as well , the sum over @xmath206 can be interchanged with the one over @xmath103 ( princeheim s theorem ) thus the following procedure is valid .",

    "but the expression in square brackets in ( [ 2_part ] ) can be performed as @xmath218\\ ] ] thus for @xmath219 even the expression in square brackets produces ( dropping the non sufficient coefficient @xmath220 or @xmath221 ) : + for @xmath222 + for @xmath223 +   + and for @xmath219 odd respectively + for @xmath224 + for @xmath225 +   + but for @xmath178 these functions behave as + @xmath226 and it means that only the contribution of terms with odd powers @xmath219 of @xmath227 could survive and these corresponds for the possible values of @xmath210 to @xmath228 .",
    "in fact the coefficient @xmath229 at @xmath151 is zero , and all other possible terms up from @xmath230 does not contain any powers of @xmath217 lower than 4 ; one can see it for example in the explicit form of the uniform asymptotical expansion of special functions entering the @xmath231 ( [ f_v_of_ik ] ) .",
    "therefore the second summand of ( [ two_parts ] ) does not produce any contribution to the @xmath188 thus we have that only the contribution from the first summand of ( [ two_parts ] ) remains , and since the term of @xmath54 is zero the searched residuum resulting from the term of @xmath215 is : @xmath232 where the ( [ first_part ] ) and the explicit form of @xmath233 $ ] have been used .",
    "finally we have @xmath234 and therefore @xmath235 this is the heat kernel coefficient @xmath2 for the configuration of the magnetic background field as given by eqs.([potential_a]-[h_r1 ] ) .",

    "in the preceding sections the ground state energy for a spinor in the background of a rectangular shaped flux tube had been numerically calculated .",
    "the corresponding jost function had been written down explicitly , also its asymptotic part .",
    "the numerical calculation required work with high arithmetic precision .",
    "the results are displayed mainly in table 1 . for small inner radius of the flux the results are close to them of @xcite where the same problem for a flux tube with homogeneous magnetic field inside , which corresponds to @xmath268 here , was considered .",
    "especially , it is seen that for large flux @xmath153 there is a compensation of the @xmath269-contribution between the finite and the asymptotic parts of the ground state energy leaving a behaviour proportional to @xmath270 as shown in fig.[fig4 ] . here",
    "the asymptotic part gave an essential contribution .",
    "the ground state energy remains negative , but numerically small .",
    "only for very large flux it could overturn the corresponding classical energy , but these values of the flux are clearly unphysical .    for values of the inner radius close to the outer one , @xmath271 ( where we have put @xmath272 ) the picture changes .",
    "here the vacuum energy grows faster than the classical one .",
    "generally , both diverge proportional to @xmath273 , the classical energy is equal to @xmath274 .",
    "the vacuum energy , multiplied by @xmath275 , is shown in fig.[fig5 ] in a logarithmic scale .",
    "it is negative and growing a bit faster than the classical one which would be a constant in this plot . here",
    "the asymptotic part of the ground state energy becomes increasingly unimportant ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the question whether the vacuum energy for sufficiently small @xmath275 may become larger than the classical one can not be answered by the numerical results obtained .",
    "the problem is that the computations become very time consuming because of the increasing precision which is required . also , one has to take higher @xmath134 and @xmath103 into account .",
    "the weakening of the growth for @xmath276 and @xmath277 seen in fig.[fig5 ] may be caused just by this reason .",
    "here one has to note that the integrand is for large @xmath134 and @xmath103 always negative ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) so that dropping some part ( as we did within the numerical procedure ) diminishes the result .",
    "so , as a result , we can not exclude from the given calculation that the vacuum energy grows for a strong background field faster than the classical energy .",
    "further work is necessary to better understand these questions .",
    "an improvement of the numerical procedure is certainly desirable .",
    "it could go along two lines .",
    "first , in the calculation of the jost function the compensation of large exponentials should be avoided by taking them into account analytically .",
    "second , in the compensation between the logarithm of the jost function and its asymptotic expansion in the integrand of @xmath257 in eq.([ef],[ef1 ] ) higher orders of the asymptotic expansion could be used .",
