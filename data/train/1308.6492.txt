    "dilute magnetic oxides ( dmos ) have been identified as one of the most attractive materials for future spintronics applications @xcite .",
    "however the field has also been very controversial . in some cases",
    "the magnetism has been attributed to ferromagnetic nano - inclusions @xcite although there have been a number of cases where the magnetic properties were identified in samples without any impurity phases leading to the conclusion that a ` non - trivial defect - related ' ferromagnetic phase exists in some oxides @xcite .",
    "the possible explanations of oxide magnetism were further limited by the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism experiment which showed that co ions in zncoo were themselves paramagnetic @xcite ; this startling result has been confirmed by further investigations of other doped magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition , large magnetic moments have also been observed in undoped oxides @xcite .",
    "this has meant that acceptable models should now include those where the magnetism is associated with electrons in states other than on the transition - metal ( tm ) ions themselves .",
    "another feature of tm - doped oxide materials is that ferromagnetism ( fm ) is absent in epitaxial films and in the bulk , this was quantified by straumal _ et al _ @xcite who proposed a model of grain boundary ( gb ) fm in pure and doped zno .",
    "they found that fm only occurred if the grains were sufficiently small @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the critical grain size , was increased if mn was doped into zno , a similar effect has been seen in mn - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "coey @xcite proposed that the fm originates from a narrow spin split defect band whose population is controlled by doping tm ions .",
    "there are two obvious candidates for such a band : it might arise from states localized at the grain boundaries as suggested by the work of straumal _ et al _ @xcite or it might be the narrow band originating from states at oxygen vacancies as had been proposed earlier for both zno and in@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this letter investigates the effects of the grains and the gbs on the overall magnetization in v - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films .",
    "in@xmath5o@xmath6 is a promising candidate material to exhibit strong gb magnetism because there is electron accumulation at the surfaces of pure in@xmath5o@xmath6 grains @xcite and it can also be grown strongly oxygen - deficient .",
    "there have been a number of studies of doped in@xmath5o@xmath6 following the initial identification of strong magnetism for cr doping @xcite .",
    "fm has been seen for doping with mn @xcite , fe @xcite , co @xcite , v @xcite and also in undoped , but oxygen - deficient , in@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite and as a surface effect in ito @xcite .",
    "vanadium is interesting and a good dopant for our study because v@xmath7 can substitute for in@xmath7 , however its smaller ionic radius ( 78pm ) compared with ( 94pm ) for in@xmath7 will cause local strains and enhance the formation of gbs ; it has been shown to be strongly ferromagnetic in in@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite in spite of the fact that it does not form compounds with in and o that are ferromagnetic at room temperature .    in this letter",
    "we describe measurements on a series of v - doped in@xmath5o@xmath6 films that were fabricated such that they had different grain sizes . in order to investigate the origin of the observed fm , we measured the structural , magnetic , electrical , optical and magneto - optical properties of v - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 films .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements allow us to estimate the preferred orientation , grain size , whereas the structural perfection around the tm site is studied by extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) .",
    "magnetic properties were characterized by squid magnetometry which detects contributions from both spin and orbital magnetism and by magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) , which is a powerful tool to confirm the energy of the magnetic states that give rise to the magnetism but since it is due to electric dipole transitions only detects orbital moments @xcite .",
    "we show that the overall magnetism originates from both the grains and the gbs in this material .",
    "the samples with smaller grain size have larger magnetization but a smaller mcd signal , whereas the samples with with a larger grain size have a smaller magnetization but larger mcd signal ; this is due to the different contribution of the orbital magnetism in the two components .",

    "the laser was used at a pulse repetition rate of 10 hz , which gave an energy density up to 400 mj / pulse .",

    "the thickness of the films was measured with a dektak profilometer and was kept almost constant at 120 @xmath16 10 nm .",
    "temperature dependence of the resistance and hall effect measurements were performed in the van der pauw geometry , in a continuous - flow helium cryostat in the range 5 - 300 k in fields up to 1 t. optical absorption spectra and magneto - optical spectra were measured in faraday geometry by using a photo - elastic modulator from 2.0 ev to 3.5 ev in fields up to 1.8 t. since this energy range is below the band - gap of in@xmath0o@xmath1 , the magneto - optical response probes the magnetic polarization of any gap states .",

    "the saturation magnetization decreases as a function of deposition temperature , behaving similarly to the optical absorption .",
    "this shows that when the grain size gets larger at higher deposition temperature , the scattering from the sample surface becomes weaker , thus leading to smaller absorption ; this is in consistent with measurements of d found from xrd .",
    "more grain boundaries form with smaller grain size in the normalized volume .",
    "the decrease of saturation magnetization as the grain size increases strongly suggests that much of the observed magnetism originates from the grain boundaries .",
    "the mcd values quoted in fig.7 were measured at 3.3 ev , which is just below the band - gap ; this is believed to correspond to transitions to spin - polarized gap states",
    ". the mcd signal would be zero if the magnetization were zero , but they are not necessarily proportional because of the importance of spin - orbit coupling . the mcd spectra shown in fig.[fig : fig_5](b ) peak at the band edge as expected for an oxide but actually fall into two distinct groups .",
    "there is a small dispersive signal for the samples grown at 300 and 400 @xmath2 , where the samples have a high magnetization , and a larger absorption - like signal for the higher temperatures where the magnetization is reduced .",
    "these spectra are similar to those found for mn and fe - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the mn - doped sample had a high magnetization when grown at low temperatures and the mcd spectrum was dispersive .",
    "the maximum magnetization for the fe - doped sample occurred for high growth temperature and this was accompanied by an absorptive mcd spectrum .",
    "the magnitude of the absorptive mcd spectrum for fe was much larger than that for the dispersive signal for mn , even though the magnetization was significantly higher for mn .",
    "the mcd depends on a change in the angular momentum in the optical transitions and this is related to the observed magnetization via the spin - orbit coupling . for any one material the mcd follows the magnetization as a function of temperature or magnetic field",
    "however , for different materials , the magnitude of the mcd also depends on the spin - orbit coupling that is necessary to induce an orbital moment . for the purposes of this discussion boundary magnetism and grain magnetism",
    "are two different quantities .",
    "thus it appears that the magnetism located at grain boundaries arises from electrons with rather weak spin - orbit coupling hence a large grain boundary magnetism gives a small mcd signal .",
    "on the other hand the electrons that cause the magnetism in the grains have a much larger spin - orbit interaction and hence a large mcd signal may be generated by a smaller magnetization .",
    "these results are strong evidence to support the contention that the observed fm originates from both the grain boundaries and the grains .",
    "we note that the magnetization from the grains increases when the grains form a larger fraction of the whole sample and also the concentration of v ions has increased as indicated by the change in lattice constant observed by xrd .",
    "the large @xmath33 from the boundaries has a relatively low orbital contribution and hence gives a small mcd signal .",
    "as the grains get larger the grain contribution begins to be more important and this has a larger orbital contribution and hence gives a relatively large mcd .",
    "the gb fm , however , dominates in the samples .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed room temperature fm in v - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 films by squid and mcd measurements . the increase in grain size with deposition temperature",
    "was observed in doped films , similar to that found in mn- and fe - doped films @xcite . structural characterization indicated v ions are substituted at the in sites in the in@xmath0o@xmath1 host , and more v ions were incorporated into the host lattice at higher deposition temperature .",
    "although the fit to the exafs data shows some mismatch , the existence of secondary phases of v was excluded . the contribution from secondary phases in doped films",
    "was also excluded by low temperature mcd measurements .",
    "the large magnetization seen for v - doped samples , when the grains were small indicates that gb fm is observed in v - doped in@xmath0o@xmath1 films , similarly to that found in mn - doped zno and in@xmath0o@xmath1 films @xcite , as a growing evidence of gb model .",
    "the magnetization of v - doped samples is relatively large compared with other oxide materials - it may be significant that unlike mn , co which are present as divalent ions and fe where magnetization depends on having some divalent fe @xcite as well as trivalent fe the v ions are all v@xmath7 and yet the magnetization is unusually large",
    ". the system with gb fm would be a promising source of spin - polarized currents if the electrons that are polarized at the gbs carry an appreciable fraction of the total current in the material .",
