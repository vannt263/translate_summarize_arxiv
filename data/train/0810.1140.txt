    "the luminous ( @xmath11 ) orion bn / kl infrared nebula is the nearest ( @xmath12  pc : @xcite ) and probably most studied high - mass star forming region ( hmsfr ) in the galaxy .",
    "more than 20 spectral line surveys have been carried out in the mm and submm bands over the last 25 years ( 72 - 91 ghz : @xcite ; 70 - 115 ghz : @xcite ; 138 - 151  ghz : @xcite ; 150 - 160  ghz : @xcite ; 160 - 165  ghz : @xcite ; 215 - 247  ghz : @xcite ; 218 - 243  ghz : @xcite ; 247 - 263  ghz : @xcite ; 257 - 273  ghz : @xcite ; 330 - 360  ghz : @xcite ; 325 - 360  ghz : @xcite ; 342 - 359  ghz : @xcite ; 334 - 343  ghz : @xcite ; 455 - 507  ghz : @xcite ; 486 - 492 and 541 - 577  ghz : @xcite ; 607 - 725  ghz : @xcite ; 795 - 903  ghz : @xcite ) .",
    "imaging line surveys of orion - bn / kl have also been conducted using the submillimeter array interferometer ( sma ) in the submm ranges 337.2 - 339.2  ghz and 347.2 - 349.2  ghz @xcite , and 679.78 - 681.75  ghz and 689.78 - 691.75  ghz @xcite .",
    "we report here the first high spectral resolution survey at 7  mm between frequencies of 42.3 and 43.6  ghz .",
    "the main target of our survey was sio which is a well - known tracer of shocks in hmsfrs , and so it is particularly suitable for tracing high - velocity outflowing molecular gas . in this context ,",
    "sio observations provide observational constraints on the acceleration mechanisms of high - mass protostellar outflows , and thus also test different theories of massive star formation . for example , if massive stars form from massive cores in a qualitatively similar but scaled - up fashion to low - mass stars @xcite then similar disk and outflow properties are expected , such as magneto - centrifugally launched x - winds @xcite and/or disk - winds @xcite that are aligned and collimated orthogonally to the plane of the accretion disk . alternatively ,",
    "if massive stars form via more chaotic accretion processes , such as competitive accretion @xcite or stellar mergers @xcite , then more disordered disks and outflows might be expected . a generic prediction of x - wind and disk - wind models is that the outflow is initially accelerated to about the local escape speed of the launching region .",
    "relatively large ( @xmath1310 - 30% ) fractions of the accretion flow are predicted to be launched from the inner disk , within a few stellar radii , where the escape speeds can approach @xmath131000  km  s@xmath7(the escape speed from the surface of a 20  m@xmath14 protostar that has contracted to the zero age main sequence , for example ) .",
    "however , such high - speed winds have never been observed close to high mass protostars .",
    "orion bn / kl is a good target for observations at 7  mm .",
    "first , strong sio maser emission from three vibrational states are excited at 7  mm by a high - mass protostar in the region , source  i @xcite , and their exceptionally high brightness temperature might facilitate detection of ( weak ) high - velocity components in the protostellar wind compared to thermal emission @xcite .",
    "second , though orion is a rich source of line emission at millimeter wavelengths @xcite , one may reasonably anticipate a lower density of lines in the relatively long wavelength 7  mm band .",
    "third , source  i is the only known origin of sio emission in orion bn / kl @xcite , diminishing the risk of confusion .    on the theoretical side , @xcite presented models for magneto - centrifugally launched outflows from a massive protostar , such as the source that may be powering the orion - bn /",
    "kl region , source  i. @xcite pointed out that close passage of the bn object , which is a runaway b star , may have tidally perturbed the accretion disk within the last 1000  yr , perhaps leading to enhanced accretion and outflow activity that may help to explain the  explosive \" appearance of the outflow on larger scales @xcite . alternatively",
    ", @xcite have argued that the explosive , poorly - collimated nature of the outflow may have been caused by a protostellar merger .",
    "observations of fast ( and inner ) portions of the outflow , and their relation to any protostellar accretion disk , are essential to distinguish these various scenarios .    thus , in this paper we searched for high velocity outflows by using single - dish observations of sio transitions .",
    "although the beam ( @xmath15 ) of our observations is not sufficient to identify the driving source of the outflow in the region , previous high - angular resolution observations showed unequivocally that the sio maser emission probes circumstellar gas at distances 10 - 1000  au from source  i ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while we found evidence for flows up to @xmath16  km  s@xmath7 , we did not find any conclusive indication of higher - speed winds , although several unidentified emission lines are candidates . as an additional byproduct of this search , we have detected for the first time in orion bn",
    "/ kl the @xmath6 transition of two sio isotopologues , @xmath4sio  and @xmath5sio , and we have identified a number of other chemical species in the region .    in this paper , we present the spectral profiles for the @xmath3sio  @xmath17 and @xmath4sio  and @xmath5sio  @xmath18 lines as well as all the molecular identifications in the surveyed range of frequencies .",
    "this work is structured as follows :  2 describes the observations and data reduction , the results of the line identification are illustrated in  3 , and an analysis on individual species is presented in  4 .",
    "a summary is presented in  5 .",
    "the survey was conducted conducted with the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 100  m robert byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) on 2007 november 10 at 7  mm for a total of 4  h. a pointing position @xmath19.-2pt@xmath205 , @xmath21 , and an lsr source velocity of + 5  km  s@xmath7was used for orion bn / kl .",
    "the telescope had a fwhm beamwidth of @xmath22 at 7  mm .",
    "the gbt spectrometer was configured to provide two 200  mhz ifs in two polarizations , with a frequency resolution of 24.4  khz ( corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath23  km  s@xmath7at 43  ghz ) .",
    "the two bands overlapped 40  mhz , resulting in an instantaneous band of 360  mhz .",
    "four scheduling blocks of 1  h were observed at four different frequencies , that placed the following transitions of sio near the band centers : @xmath3sio  @xmath24 ( 43423.76mhz ) , @xmath25 ( 43122.03mhz ) , @xmath26 ( 42820.48mhz ) , @xmath27 ( 42519.379mhz ) .",
    "the frequency setup resulted in a continuous coverage of 42.3 - 43.6  ghz ( corresponding to a bandwidth of @xmath28  km  s@xmath7at 43  ghz ) .",
    "data were taken in a dual beam mode by nodding the antenna , with signal ( on - source ) and reference ( off - source ) spectra observed simultaneously in two beams , the target always being present in one .",
    "antenna pointing and focus corrections were obtained every 45 minutes by observing a strong nearby continuum source .",
    "data were reduced using scripts written in the interactive data language within the gbtidl software .",
    "we removed 5th - order polynomial baselines from the total - power spectra , which were subsequently boxcar smoothed to an effective resolution of 97.7  khz ( or 0.68  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "spectra were calibrated to units of flux density ( jy ) using a value of zenith opacity of 0.07 , estimated from measurements of t@xmath29 at different elevation angles ( @xmath30 ) , and an aperture efficiency of @xmath31 , based on the gain curve measured in 2005 over an elevation range @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the resulting 1  @xmath33 noise level attained in an integration of 30 minutes was @xmath34  mjy ( @xmath35  mk in units of corrected antenna temperature , @xmath36 ) in a 97.7  khz channel . the units of peak intensity will be given throughout the paper either in jy or k , where @xmath37 is appropriate for the gbt at 43  ghz .    because the @xmath3sio  lines are quite strong ( 30 - 1000  jy ) , we inspected the spectra for artifacts that might occur due to inefficiencies in the signal path ( e.g. , aliasing ) .",
    "we identified ",
    "ghost \" lines offset @xmath38  mhz from the @xmath8 , 1 , and 2 lines , attenuated by a factor of @xmath39 with respect to the line peaks .",
    "these artifacts arise from 100  mhz sidebands in the output of the voltage controlled crystal oscillator that is used to mix signals to a standard if band at the gbt , and these therefore affect all observing bands @xcite .",
    "other than the @xmath3sio  lines , no other artifacts were detected ; the ghosts associated with a typical 0.5  jy line would be a factor of four below the observed noise level .",
    "for the purpose of this analysis we excised data in the contaminated frequency ranges . in total 30.9  mhz were lost .",
    "line identifications are based on the jpl @xcite , cdms @xcite , and lovas @xcite catalogs .",
    "selection criteria include : frequency coincidence , line velocity , upper state energy , line strength , and presence / absence of other lines from similar levels either in the surveyed regions or at higher frequencies .",
    "the calibrated spectra are shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath40  km  s@xmath7has been used to derive the frequency axis and markers are placed at the laboratory rest frequencies of the transitions attributed to the observed line features . above 15  mjy ( 3@xmath33 ) , we found 55 resolvable features ( 12 unidentified ) consisting of 67 lines , partially blended ( table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "we identified a total of 13 different species , 5 isotopologues , and 2 vibrationally excited states ( from sio ) within the data set .",
    "most of the detected lines can be attributed to known molecular species , previously detected in orion bn / kl at higher frequencies : sio , so@xmath0 , nh@xmath0d , hcooh , nh@xmath0cho , c@xmath0h@xmath2cn , ch@xmath1och@xmath1 , ch@xmath1ocho ( table  [ species ] ) .",
    "interestingly , in this survey we also confirm the detection of one complex oxygen - bearing species , ch@xmath1coch@xmath1 ( acetone ) , recently observed in orion bn / kl at 3  mm ( sect .  [ ace ] ) , and we found strong evidence for long carbon - chain ( c - chain ) molecules : hc@xmath2n and hc@xmath10n ( sect .",
    "[ cyano ] ) , and possibly the cation hc@xmath1nh@xmath41 ( sect .  [ others ] ) .",
    "multiple velocity components are present in the orion spectra @xcite , which complicates the line identification : the hot core ( @xmath42 @xmath43  km  s@xmath7 , @xmath44  km  s@xmath7 ) , the compact ridge @xmath45 warm and dense gas about 10@xmath20 south - west of the hot core ( @xmath42 @xmath13 8  km  s@xmath7 , @xmath46 3  km  s@xmath7 ) , the extended ridge @xmath45 ambient gas in the orion molecular cloud omc-1 ( @xmath47 9  km  s@xmath7 , @xmath48  km  s@xmath7 ) , and the plateau or outflow ( @xmath49  km  s@xmath7 , @xmath50  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "high - angular resolution ( @xmath51 ) imaging @xcite unequivocally showed that different molecules are mostly concentrated in different regions and hence emit at different velocities : large oxygen - bearing species ( such as ch@xmath1och@xmath1 and hcooh ) are found primarily toward the compact ridge and hence emit mostly at 810  km  s@xmath7 ; large nitrogen - bearing species ( e.g. , c@xmath0h@xmath1cn and c@xmath0h@xmath2cn ) and sio are located toward the hot core and source  i ( separated by @xmath52 ) , respectively , and emit at @xmath53  km  s@xmath7 ; finally , sulfur - bearing species ( e.g. , so@xmath0 ) show emission towards both the compact ridge and the hot core .    for all observed molecules , apparent shifts between the observed lines and the rest frequencies",
    "are evident ( fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) , corresponding to different origins among the several components of the star forming region .",
    "for example , oxygen - bearing species show an average shift from the laboratory frequencies around 0.5  mhz , which corresponds to @xmath54  km  s@xmath7from the assumed systemic velocity of 5  km  s@xmath7 , in agreement with an origin in the compact ridge .",
    "when several lines of the same species ( not affected by blending ) were detected , we performed a rotation diagram analysis to estimate column density , @xmath55 , and rotational temperature , @xmath56 . with the assumption of lte ,",
    "the source - averaged column density from an optically thin transition is given by @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the partition function , @xmath59 is the upper state energy of the transition ( k ) , @xmath60 is the integrated line intensity . ] ( k  km  s@xmath7 ) , @xmath61 is the beam filling factor ( see eq .  2 of @xcite ) , @xmath62 is the main beam efficiency ( @xmath63 for the gbt ) , @xmath64 is the product of the line strength and the square of the molecular dipole moment ( d@xmath65 ) , and @xmath66 is the transition frequency ( ghz ) .",
    "we obtain the rotation temperature and the column density from a least square fit of upper state energy to integrated line intensity for different transitions in log space ( a rotation diagram ) .",
    "different source sizes are assumed to calculate the beam filling factor , depending on the molecule and origin ( i.e. , hot core , compact or extended ridge ) . for molecules with only one or a few blended lines , we used temperature and column density estimations from previous works @xcite .",

    "however , the maser emission from the @xmath3sio  @xmath25 and @xmath26 transitions arises at temperatures of 1000 - 2000  k and densities of @xmath135  @xmath136 , which makes sio a plausible candidate as a tracer .",
    "also , the intrinsically high brightness temperatures of maser emission enables detection from volumes that might be too small to generate detectable emission from thermal processes . with this in mind , we inspected the immediate vicinity of the vibrationally excited lines near the systemic velocity in the survey spectrum .",

    "<S> we have surveyed molecular line emission from orion bn / kl from 42.3 to 43.6 ghz with the green bank telescope . </S>",
    "<S> sixty - seven lines were identified and ascribed to 13 different molecular species . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum at 7  mm is dominated by sio , so@xmath0 , ch@xmath1och@xmath1 , and c@xmath0h@xmath2cn . </S>",
    "<S> five transitions have been detected from the sio isotopologues @xmath3sio , @xmath4sio , and @xmath5sio . </S>",
    "<S> we report here for the first time the spectra of the @xmath4sio  and @xmath5sio  @xmath6 emission in orion bn / kl , and we show that they have double - peaked profiles with velocity extents similar to the main isotopologue . the main motivation for the survey was the search of high - velocity ( 100 - 1000  km  s@xmath7 ) outflows in the bn / kl region as traced by sio doppler components </S>",
    "<S> . some of the unidentified lines in principle could be high - velocity sio features , but without imaging data their location can not be established . </S>",
    "<S> wings of emission are present in the @xmath8 @xmath3sio , @xmath4sio  and @xmath5sio  profiles , and we suggest that the @xmath8 emission from the three isotopologues might trace a moderately high - velocity ( @xmath9  km  s@xmath7 ) component of the flows around the high - mass protostar sourcei in the orion bn / kl region . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the 7  mm detection of a complex oxygen - bearing species , acetone ( ch@xmath1coch@xmath1 ) , which has been recently observed towards the hot core at 3  mm , and we have found further indications of the presence of long cyanopolyynes ( hc@xmath2n and hc@xmath10n ) in the quiescent cold gas of the extended ridge . </S>"
