    "ferropericlase ( mgfe)o forms a solid solution between periclase ( mgo ) and wustite ( fe@xmath4o ) and crystallizes in cubic rock - salt structure .",
    "ferropericlase ( mg , fe)o is a major lower mantle mineral , and its high - pressure and high - temperature properties are of great importance for the earth science .",
    "wustite is a mott insulator and periclase is a wide band gap insulator . at the normal conditions ( mgfe)o is a paramagnetic insulator , which the neel temperature depends of fe content . in ferropericlase oxidation state of fe",
    "is fe@xmath3 ( d@xmath5 configuration ) .",
    "the d@xmath5 configuration may be realized in two states with different spin : the high - spin ( hs ) state ( s=2 ) and the low - spin ( ls ) state ( s=0 ) .",
    "if the hund s exchange energy prevails the crystal field splitting then the hs state is realized , otherwise ions are in the ls state .",
    "the spin state can change depending on the ratio of the crystal field and exchange energy ( for example , under pressure ) .",
    "spin - state changes of fe@xmath3 ion in ferropericlase will influence many of its properties , including bulk density , elasticity and electrical conductivity .",
    "for these reasons , a knowledge of the pressure dependence and characteristics of the spin crossover transition in ferropericlase is necessary for understanding the constitution of the earth s lower mantle .",
    "the spin crossover of fe@xmath3 ion in ( mgfe)o under pressure was intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . at a pressure near the spin crossover ions in the hs and ls states may exist simultaneously due to temperature fluctuations .",
    "such a mixed state leads to an extended transition region width of the order of 20  gpa @xcite . according to experimental data @xcite pressure of start and end of the spin crossover as well as its width",
    "are dependent on temperature . in various articles",
    "one can find different experimental estimates of transition pressure .",
    "for room temperature the spin crossover may start as low as 35 gpa @xcite and end as high as 75  gpa @xcite . at temperature @xmath6500",
    "k the hs - ls transition occurs in the pressure range 40 - 70  gpa @xcite .",
    "another effect of high pressure is the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "the mit under pressure is observed , for example , in feo , mno , fe@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "metallization of ( mgfe)o with pressure has been predicted by theory @xcite but not observed experimentally at least up to 140  gpa and 2100  k @xcite .",
    "both the hs - ls and the mit in mno and fe@xmath7o@xmath8 with pressure can be successfully described using the lda+dmft calculation scheme @xcite .",
    "presence of the mit and absence of the hs - ls with pressure in feo is described in the lda+dmft calculations also @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the lda+dmft method reproduces the hs - ls transition for ( mgfe)o with pressure . at the same time",
    "the hs - ls transition in ( mgfe)o in contrast to mno and fe@xmath7o@xmath8 is not accompanied by mit .",
    "the lda+dmft calculation scheme @xcite is constructed in the following way : first , a hamiltonian @xmath9 is produced using converged lda results for the system under investigation , then the many - body hamiltonian is set up , and finally the corresponding self - consistent dmft equations are solved .",
    "the basis of calculation is the supercell containing 8 formula units of mgo in which two mg atoms were replaced by two fe atoms .",
    "the positions of the iron atoms were chosen so that the impurity atoms are maximally spaced from each other . to calculate the electronic structure of ferropericlase at ambient pressure",
    "the experimentally determined parameters of the crystal structure of ( fe@xmath10mg@xmath11)o were used @xcite .",
    "the application of hydrostatic pressure simulated by supercell volume reduction with 5% steps . for each volume parameter of the coulomb repulsion u was calculated @xcite and a low - dimensional hamiltonian in the basis of wannier functions using the projection procedure @xcite was recorded .",
    "hamiltonian includes the fe-@xmath12 and o-@xmath13 states and has a dimension 34@xmath1434 .",
    "the obtained values of the parameter of the coulomb repulsion u vary in the range from u=4.9  ev for the equilibrium volume cell to u=4.24  ev for the smallest considered cell , the volume of which is reduced to 70% relative to the original .",
    "the exchange interaction parameter j is not changed at varying the volume of the unit cell , it was selected j=0.95  ev . the lda calculations were performed using the tb - lmto - asa ( tight binding - linearized muffin - tin orbitals - atomic sphere approximation ) code @xcite .    the relation between the volume of the unit cell and pressure was made according to data @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented below have been done for crystal volumes corresponding to values of pressure up to 107  gpa .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian to be solved by the dmft has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the coulomb interaction matrix , @xmath17 is the occupation number operator for the @xmath2 electrons with orbitals @xmath18 or @xmath19 and spin indices @xmath20 or @xmath21 on the @xmath22-th site . the term @xmath23 stands for the _ d_-_d _",
    "interaction already accounted for in the lda , so called double - counting correction . in the present calculation the double - counting was chosen in the following form @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the self - consistent total number of _ d _ electrons obtained within the lda+dmft , @xmath26 is the average coulomb parameter for the _ d _ shell .",
    "the elements of @xmath27 matrix are parameterized by @xmath28 and @xmath29 according to procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the effective impurity problem for the dmft was solved by the hybridization expansion continuous - time quantum monte - carlo method ( ct - qmc ) @xcite .",
    "calculations for all volumes were performed in the paramagnetic state at the inverse temperature @xmath30=20 ev@xmath31 corresponding to 580  k. spectral functions on real energies were calculated by maximum entropy method ( mem)@xcite .",
    "in octahedral coordination the fe _ d _ band is split by crystal field in triply degenerated @xmath32 and doubly degenerated @xmath33 subbands .",
    "spectral functions for all pressure values calculated by mem from ct - qmc calculations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "the spectral function for ambient pressure phase ( app ) shows well defined insulating behavior .",
    "the energy gap for @xmath32 is smaller than that for @xmath34 states .",
    "the top of valence band and bottom of conduction band are formed by @xmath32 states .",
    "the value of band gap is @xmath35e@xmath36=1.13  ev .",
    "for app the paramagnetic insulator state was obtained , the average value of local magnetic moment @xmath37 is 3.76@xmath38 , states with @xmath32 and @xmath34 symmetry are partially filled .",
    "the occupation numbers for fe d orbitals are n(@xmath34)=2.16 and n(@xmath32)=4.14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occ ] ) .",
    "this agrees well with high - spin state of fe@xmath3 ion in cubic crystal field .    with the pressure growth ,",
    "the population of orbital with @xmath34-symmetry becomes energetically unfavorable and the filling of @xmath32-orbitals starts . at pressure 34",
    "gpa the first noticeable changes arise : the occupancy of @xmath34 orbitals and the average value of local magnetic moment decrease , occupancy of @xmath32 orbitals increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occ ] ) .",
    "the pronounced maximum of the @xmath32 spectral function is formed in valence band ( fig .",

    "@xmath37 becomes 0.89@xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occ ] ) .",
    "the valence band is formed by the @xmath32 states , the conduction band is formed by the @xmath34 states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) . that is completely different mechanism of the band gap formation for the ls state in comparison with that for hs state .",
    "at the end of the transition the value of energy gap is reduced to @xmath35e@xmath36=0.65  ev , the metal - insulator transition does not occur up to a maximum considered pressure 107  gpa .",
    "the crystal structure of ferropericlase is completely analogous to the structure of feo . in both cases",
    "fe@xmath3 ion is in an octahedral environment of oxygen atoms , in both cases the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is formed by the d - fe states . in feo metallic spectral function is observed only for @xmath32 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the absence of mit in ferropericlase in contrast to feo could be explained as follows . unlike feo , in",
    "( fe@xmath0mg@xmath1)o there are no direct overlap of the d - fe orbitals , so the fe-@xmath32 bands are significantly narrower than in feo ( in the lda width at half maximum is less then 0.1  ev , appropriate figure is not shown ) . under pressure fe-@xmath32 bands becomes wider , but the pressure 107  gpa is not enough for the metallization of the spectrum .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "there are different experimental evaluations of the pressure at which the magnetic spin transition occurs .",
    "our theoretical estimate of the transition pressure interval 34 - 73  gpa is in reasonable agreement with experimental results @xcite . in our calculation",
    "the supercell approximation to construct ( fe@xmath0mg@xmath1)o was used , which makes artificial spatial ordering of iron atoms .",
    "promising continuation of the present study seems the lda+dmft+cpa method , which allows a natural way to take into account disorder in the sublattice of fe - mg .",
    "we have performed the lda+dmft calculation for ( fe@xmath0mg@xmath1)o at 580  k and values of pressure from the ambient one up to 107  gpa .",
    "the hs to ls transition of the fe@xmath3 ion starts at the pressure 34  gpa and at the pressure 73  gpa transition is completed .",
    "at the pressure 107  gpa the value of band gap decreases till 0.7 ev , but in contrast to feo the metal - insulator transition does not occur .",
