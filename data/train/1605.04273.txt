    "building a microwave device ( or just a simple element of certain geometry ) from a superconducting material and obtaining detailed knowledge of its properties is useful in several different contexts .",
    "firstly , it can help for the full understanding of the superconducting material itself .",
    "microwave frequencies , with a typical range of - , correspond to thermal energies of - and are in the range of or below critical temperatures @xmath3 and energy gaps of many superconductors . thus the microwave response of a superconductor depends on both the dissipationless cooper pairs and the dissipating thermally excited quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "accordingly , microwave experiments probe the different charge carriers , and give access to quantities such as superconducting penetration depth ( related to cooper pair density and superfluid stiffness ) , energy gap , surface resistance , and complex optical conductivity @xcite , but they can also reveal different dynamical properties , such as quasiparticle relaxation , critical fluctuations , or collective excitations @xcite .",
    "another field of interest for superconducting microwave devices are technical applications such as microwave filters , but they also include numerous types of resonators , detectors , amplifiers , and related devices in fundamental research @xcite . depending on application , e.g.  in astrophysics or quantum information science , planar superconducting resonators might be operated with vastly different power levels , and , correspondingly , different microscopic processes govern the resonator performance and possible strategies for device improvements @xcite .",
    "microwave spectroscopy in condensed matter physics is yet another resonator application . for many materials of present research , such as magnetic and heavy - fermion materials , there exist important low energy scales that can be accessed with microwave spectroscopy @xcite , and a very prominent case here is the vast range of conventional and unconventional superconductors , including cuprate , pnictide , organic , heavy - fermion , and strongly disordered superconductors @xcite . to this end , a variety of different microwave spectroscopy techniques",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "studying conducting materials is also our motivation for the development of superconducting pb stripline resonators that can act as compact and sensitive probes in cryogenic microwave spectroscopy @xcite . here",
    "pb with @xmath4 and a critical magnetic field of about @xmath5 is a well suited basis material @xcite , as it can be processed for thin films rather easily . for the spectroscopic study of certain materials @xcite",
    ", application of a magnetic field in the order of tens of mt is helpful , and therefore we address the microwave properties of pb stripline resonators in finite magnetic field .",
    "this is not only relevant for spectroscopy , but like any exposure of a superconductor to a magnetic field is also an interesting issue on its own .",
    "operating planar microwave devices in magnetic field has been studied in the context of vortex motion , dissipation , and pinning in type - ii superconductors , where a pronounced field dependence is found that is unwanted for applications @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for type - i superconductors such questions have , so far , attracted much less attention .",
    "in fact , one motivation for our work on pb resonators is that for a type - i superconductor , up to the critical field , there should be very weak field dependence , which is convenient for spectroscopic studies .",
    "however , in earlier work it has been found that normal - conducting areas similar to vortices can persist in bulk superconductors of type i @xcite and especially in pb @xcite .",
    "this flux trapping effect , as well as an increased critical magnetic field for resistance restoration and a rather broad resistance transition commonly occur in `` hard '' superconductors of type i that contain many impurities and imperfections @xcite .",
    "however , this has so far rarely been investigated with microwaves in a variable magnetic field , yet a detailed understanding is required as residual normal - conducting areas in pb could gravely influence the electrodynamic properties .    in this work",
    "we examine pb stripline resonators in varying external magnetic field up to , below and above the critical magnetic field @xmath6 , at temperatures of to . with the determination of penetration depth and surface resistance we are able to access the complex conductivity and find striking similarities to measurements in variable temperature .",
    "we study possible influences of remaining normal - conducting areas in the superconducting phase by first suppressing superconductivity with magnetic fields above @xmath6 and then regaining superconductivity by decreasing the magnetic field . in order to demonstrate the possibility to use pb stripline resonators for microwave spectroscopy applications in varying magnetic field",
    ", we study a sn sample with a critical temperature of @xmath7 and a critical magnetic field of @xmath8 @xcite with the stripline resonator .",
    "the geometry of our microwave stripline resonators is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] , as three - dimensional schematic view ( a ) and in cross section ( b , c ) .",
    "they consist of a thick and wide center conductor , which is embedded between two dielectric sapphire plates of thickness , which in turn are sandwiched between two conductive ground planes above and below .",
    "the pb center conductor is evaporated onto one of the sapphire plates and has a meander structure .",
    "two gaps in the center conductor separated from each other at a certain distance @xmath9 reflect the microwave signal to a large extend , allowing the microwave to form a standing wave between the gaps .",
    "fundamental frequencies vary with the separation @xmath9 of the gaps and in our case range between to with higher harmonics of the fundamental frequency being measurable up to .",
    "this propagation of the microwaves allows measurements with superconducting stripline resonators to be particularly sensitive to the state of the material near the surface . in order to study an additional superconducting material ( here : sn ) ,",
    "one of the ground planes is replaced by a sample , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](c ) .        depending on the field of application in which superconducting microwave resonators are used ,",
    "the power that is applied to drive them has to be adjusted properly .",
    "circuit qed experiments in quantum information science , for example , might employ an average number of microwave photons in the resonator that can be much smaller than one @xcite whereas the drive / readout powers for superconducting resonators can be many orders of magnitude higher for other applications @xcite . at very small power , the resonator response might be non - linear , i.e.  depend on the applied microwave power , due to two - level fluctuators @xcite whereas at very high powers there can be non - linear behavior due to the superconductor @xcite . for our experiments ,",
    "we want the applied power to be high enough for good signal - to - noise ratio in the transmission measurement but yet well below the power range where our stripline resonators becomes non - linear,@xcite , and we eventually used an input power of .    at resonance frequencies of the stripline resonator",
    "the microwave meets the resonance condition resulting in a maximum of microwave transmission . at frequencies deviating from the resonance frequency",
    "the transmission decreases rapidly , leading to a lorentzian form of the transmission signal around resonance frequencies @xcite .",
    "after correction of the data performed similar to @xcite , a fit of a lorentzian with center frequency @xmath10 and full width at half maximum @xmath11 is possible .",
    "this enables the calculation of the quality factor @xmath12 for any given resonance , defined as the ratio of power stored to power dissipated each cycle .",
    "it is a measure of losses in the resonator and dominantly influenced by the conductors . by replacing one ground plane with a superconducting sample of different material that has lower critical temperature and lower critical magnetic field than the underlying resonator , the losses in the resonator",
    "become dominated solely by the losses in the sample , giving experimental access for measurements explicitly on the sample .",
    "the determination of the quality factor @xmath13 also allows for the calculation of the surface resistance @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 a geometrical constant of the resonator @xcite and @xmath16 the permeability constant .",
    "additionally the surface reactance @xcite @xmath17 can be calculated with @xmath18 the penetration depth into the superconducting material and @xmath19 the impedance of the vacuum . calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity @xmath20 is then possible using @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 the speed of light .",
    "we studied the stripline resonator experimentally with a vector network analyzer  ( vna ) in transmission , recording the complex transmission parameter s@xmath24 .",
    "we performed the measurements in a @xmath25he cryostat , reaching down to temperatures of about .",
    "a static magnetic field was applied parallel to the resonator as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . before each measurement with variable magnetic field ,",
    "zero field cooling  ( zfc ) has been performed , meaning the resonator has been cooled down below its superconducting transition temperature in the absence of a magnetic field and the magnetic field has been applied subsequently at a fixed temperature .",
    "for a resonator made entirely out of pb ( center conductor as well as ground planes ) the quality factor @xmath13 in a varying magnetic field has been determined as shown in fig [ fig : bleiq ] for several different temperatures .",
    "@xmath13 was obtained for the second mode of the resonator at with a magnetic field up to . at fields below the critical field @xmath26",
    ", @xmath13 only decreases little .",
    "this regime resembles the meissner state . following a drastic decrease , indicating increasing losses close to the normal conductor transition",
    ", a plateau emerges leading to two kinks in the course of @xmath13 ( e.g. in the range of - at @xmath27 ) .",
    "this area is the intermediate state where superconducting and normal conducting areas coexist @xcite .",
    "since a perfectly parallel alignment of the resonator to the magnetic field is practically impossible , an intermediate phase is always existent @xcite and was found throughout all our measurements .",
    "this has also been found in earlier publications on pb microwave resonators @xcite , but was not discussed there .    leaving this state towards higher fields",
    ", @xmath13 becomes comparably small , however it does not vanish completely .",
    "this could very well be caused by remaining superconductivity in the resonator , which is typical for hard superconductors of type i @xcite .",
    "several similar effects are found , e.g. in tantalum where a gradual transition of the resistance at @xmath28 happens and is associated with superconducting `` filaments '' @xcite .",
    "this gradual transition has also been theoretically predicted @xcite and found in alloys of type ii @xcite . in our measurements",
    "these effects lead to the small values of @xmath13 , often persisting to magnetic fields way above @xmath26 , e.g. in the measurement at up to about , while @xmath29 , showing that our pb specimen contains impurities and imperfections making it a hard superconductor .     for a resonance of the pb resonator with increasing magnetic field up to at different temperatures in the range between and .",
    "@xmath13 shows only a small decrease in the meissner state with @xmath30 .",

    "[ fig : bleiq ] the critical magnetic field of pb could be determined for each temperature at half the maximum value of @xmath13 as well as the upper field limit of the intermediate state .",

    "@xmath26 has been determined at the first increase in resistivity .",

    "a dc measurement of the resistivity in magnetic field ( using a transmission line with the same geometry as the resonator without the gaps ) is shown in the inset . @xmath26",
    "derived at the first increase in resistivity is shown in the main panel as empty circles .",

    "@xmath13 rises almost to initial values with following iterations , indicating annihilation of normal conducting areas . ]    during the increase of the field @xmath13 drops to low values similar to fig  [ fig : bleiq ] at fields higher than @xmath26 .",
    "when decreasing the magnetic field again , @xmath13 starts to rise again at similar @xmath26 , however it does not reach its initial values of about , but instead only reaches a maximum value of about at @xmath37 .",
    "additionally @xmath13 still increases substantially below @xmath26 with decreasing field compared to the only small change during the initial field increase . increasing the field to negative values and exceeding @xmath26 shows similar behavior concerning hysteresis although lower in magnitude .",
    "similar to the superconducting filaments at @xmath31 , these hysteresis effects are caused by normal conducting filaments trapped in surrounding superconducting material at @xmath30 .",
    "impurities within the pb of the resonator pin the normal conducting areas , originating from the intermediate state .",
    "this is often characteristic for hard superconductors @xcite . in pb",
    "similar effects have already been shown earlier @xcite and we now confirm these using microwave measurements with stripline resonators .",
    "these effects have to be considered when performing microwave studies on pb resonators as they can gravely affect measurements .",
    "zero - field - cooling before each measurement is therefore a well - fitting procedure to circumvent these unwanted effects .",
    "the lines in fig  [ fig : hysteresis ] show a measurement using the same resonator and mode at now at @xmath38 . the external magnetic field has been repeatedly increased to a maximum positive value and",
    "afterwards decreased to a maximum negative value .",
    "the first maximum field exceeded @xmath26 and thus @xmath13 again shows hysteresis .",
    "the following iterations of this measurement however , lowered the maximum field each time to a value lower than the previous iteration ( both positive and negative ) . since @xmath26 is not exceeded during later iterations , @xmath13 increases again , reaching almost initial values .",
    "this is explained by the introduction of normal conducting areas of opposite polarity into the resonator with the second half of each iteration , where the magnetic field has negative value @xcite .",
    "normal conducting areas of opposing polarity annihilate leading to a reduction of overall normal conducting area .",
    "the regaining of the original state with this procedure can be useful if zfc can not be performed ( e.g. if it is unpractical to exceed @xmath3 ) , since a simple magnetic field sweep procedure can allow for complete restoration even at very low temperatures .    with increasing temperature the resonance frequency @xmath10 of each resonance shifts to lower frequencies .",

    "<S> planar superconducting microwave resonators are key elements in a variety of technical applications and also act as sensitive probes for microwave spectroscopy of various materials of interest in present solid state research . here </S>",
    "<S> superconducting pb is a suitable material as a basis for microwave stripline resonators .    to utilize pb stripline resonators in a variable magnetic field ( e.g. in esr measurements ) , </S>",
    "<S> the electrodynamics of such resonators in finite magnetic field has to be well understood . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we performed microwave transmission measurements ( with ample applied power to work in linear response ) on superconducting pb stripline resonators in a variable , parallel magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we determined surface resistance , penetration depth as well as real and imaginary parts , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of the complex conductivity of superconducting pb as a function of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> here we find features reminiscent of those in temperature - dependent measurements , such as a maximum in @xmath0 ( ` coherence peak ' ) . at magnetic fields above the critical field of this type - i superconductor </S>",
    "<S> we still find a low - loss microwave response , which we assign to remaining superconductivity in the form of filaments within the pb . </S>",
    "<S> hysteresis effects are found in the quality factor of resonances once the swept magnetic field has exceeded the critical magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to normal conducting areas that are pinned and can therefore persist in the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> besides zero - field - cooling we show an alternative way to eliminate these even at @xmath2 . based on our microwave data , we also determine the critical magnetic field and the critical temperature of pb in a temperature range between 1.6k and 6.5k and magnetic fields up to 140mt , showing good agreement with bcs predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore study a sn sample in a pb resonator to demonstrate the applicability of superconducting pb stripline resonators in the experimental study of other ( super-)conducting materials in a variable magnetic field .    october 10th , 2016 </S>"
