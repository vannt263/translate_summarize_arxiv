    "the dynamics of open quantum systems plays a central role in a wide class of physical systems .",
    "usually , the dynamics of an open system is described in terms of the reduced density matrix @xmath0 which is defined by the trace over the environment degrees of freedom @xcite . on the ground of the weak - coupling assumption and the rotating wave approximation the dynamics may be formulated in terms of a quantum dynamical semigroups which yields a markovian master equation @xcite",
    ". however , the dynamical equation , thus obtained , is very often untractable .",
    "this fact has encouraged some physicists @xcite to look for alternative ways to describe open systems . instead of representing the dynamics of an open system by a quantum master equation for its density matrix , it is formulated in terms of a stochastic process for the open system s wave function .",
    "the stochastic representation of quantum markov processes already appeared in a fundamental paper by davies @xcite and was applied @xcite to derive the _",
    "photocounting formula_. while the theory was originally formulated in terms of a stochastic process for the reduced density matrix , in the last decade it has been proposed @xcite as a stochastic evolution of the state vector in the reduced hilbert space ( for a review see @xcite ) . at the same time",
    "carmichael has developed the idea of an _ unravelling _ of the master equation in terms of an ensemble of _ quantum trajectories_. his theory is applicable only to a particular class of quantum systems ( the photoemissive sources ) and it induces to think that this treatment is equivalent to the master equation approach . in the last few years f.petruccione and h.p.breuer @xcite generalize and provide a mathematical formulation of carmichael s idea of _ quantum trajectories _ @xcite and of the _ monte carlo wave function method _ @xcite . in this contest their main result is to demonstrate that the dynamics given by the most general master equation in lindblad form can be represented as a _",
    "piecewise deterministic process _",
    "( pdp ) @xcite @xmath1 in the hilbert space of the open system . the physical basis to achieve their aim",
    "is provided by continuous measurement theory @xcite .",
    "the link @xcite between the first and second way of describing open quantum systems is , however , only one way in the sense i am going to explain .",
    "the cited paper contains a flow diagram that is a clear and straightforward picture to review _ concept and methods in the theory of open quantum systems _ , as the same authors title their work .",
    "the diagram shows us that pdps , describing a _ selective _ level of measurement , implies the _ non - selective one _ , appearing in the form of a lindblad markovian master equation , while the opposite has not been demonstrated .",
    "my aim is to put an arrow in the opposite direction in order to demonstrate the equivalence between the two approaches to open systems dynamics , at least under born - markov approximation . to achieve my goal i start from microscopic models and , exploiting the same approximation leading to the most general master equation ( not in lindblad form )",
    ", i solve this last exactly ( at a bath temperature @xmath2 ) obtaining an operatorial expression for @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , in the contest of optical quantum system i derive an expression for @xmath3 that is in accordance with the carmichael s one , but , differently from that , the mine is applicable also when the master equation is not in the lindblad form in which cases carmichael s solution is very often merely formal , as the same author underline in recent papers @xcite . my mathematical tool , here called _ nud theorem _",
    ", is applicable to a wide class of systems , provided that they satisfy the hypothesis necessary to make it working . optical physical systems",
    "well satisfy the conditions of nud theorem s validity and in this contest i have studied , as example of monopartite system , a single mode cavity , and as example of multipartite systems , two two - level _ dipole - dipole _ interacting atoms and @xmath4 two - level not - directly - interacting atoms placed in fixed _ arbitrary _ point inside a loss cavity @xcite . in the investigation of the monopartite systems",
    "the novelty is constituted by the operatorial way to approach to the master equations of the systems , being already known in literature @xcite their dynamical properties .",
    "i reproduce for example the _ photocounting formula _ in order to appreciate the easyness of application of my method .",
    "moreover i choose to analyze monopartite systems at a temperature @xmath2 to highlight that , differently to multipartite ones , spontaneous emission provokes decoherence phenomena that , inevitably , guides the first kind of systems to their ground states . on the contrary",
    ", multipartite systems can exhibit collective properties induced by the common reservoir @xcite .",
    "this general feature already appeared in some fundamental papers @xcite in which the interaction between atomic dipoles , induced by electromagnetic field , could cause the decay of the multiatom system with two significantly different spontaneous emission rates , one enhanced and the other reduced .    in two recent papers , as an example of multipartite system ,",
    "i have investigated the dynamics of a couple of spontaneously emitting two - level atoms , taking into account from the very beginning their dipole - dipole interaction and and @xmath4 two - level not - directly - interacting atoms placed in fixed _ arbitrary _ point inside a loss cavity @xcite .",
    "the result , not trivially expected , is that in such a condition the matter subsystem , because of the cooperation induced by energy loss mechanism , may be conditionally guided toward a stationary robust entangled state .",
    "the renewed interest toward entanglement concept reflects the consolidated belief that unfactorizable states of multipartite system provide an unreplaceable applicative resource , for example , in the quantum computing research area @xcite .",
    "however , the realization of quantum computation protocols suffers of the difficulty of isolating a quantum mechanical system from its environment . in this sense",
    "the cited work are also aimed at proposing theoretical scheme to bypass decoherence manifestations , so taking its place among intense theoretical and experimental research of the last few years @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follow : in section ii i report the principal step and approximation leading to the microscopic derivation of the markovian master equation , putting in evidence some peculiar properties of it useful in order to demonstrate the _ nud theorem n_. in section iii i solve the markovian master equation when @xmath2 . in section",
    "iv i review the applications to old exemplary problem and to new , previous unresolved , problem . in section",
    "v i try to justify the obtained dynamical behaviour in terms of continuous measurement theory .",
    "it is well know that under the rotating wave and the born - markov approximations the master equation describing the reduced dynamical behavior of a generic quantum system linearly coupled to an environment can be put in the form @xcite @xmath5+d(\\rho_s ( t)),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian describing the free evolution of the isolated system , @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    and @xmath10    @xmath11 being the one - sided fourier transforms of the reservoir correlation functions .",
    "finally we recall that the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we are going to define and whose properties we are going to explore , act only in the hilbert space of the system .    eq .  ( [ me ] ) has been derived under the hypothesis that the interaction hamiltonian between the system and the reservoir , in the schrdinger picture , is given by @xcite    @xmath14    that is the most general form of the interaction .    in the above expression @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are operators acting respectively on the hilbert space of the system and of the reservoir .",
    "( [ hi ] ) can be written in a slightly different form if one decomposes the interaction hamiltonian into eigenoperators of the system and reservoir free hamiltonian .",
    "definition supposing the spectrums of @xmath6 and @xmath17 to be discrete ( generalization to the continuous case is trivial ) let us denote the eigenvalue of @xmath6 ( @xmath17 ) by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and the projection operator onto the eigenspace belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "then we can define the operators : @xmath22 @xmath23    from the above definition we immediately deduce the following relations    @xmath24=-\\omega a_{\\alpha } ( \\omega),\\;\\;\\ ; [ h_b , b_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)]=-\\omega b_{\\alpha } ( \\omega),\\ ] ]    @xmath25=+\\omega a^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)\\;\\;\\ ; and \\;\\;\\ ; [ h_b , b^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)]=+\\omega b^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega).\\ ] ]    an immediate consequence is that the operators @xmath26 e @xmath27 raise and lower the energy of the system @xmath28 by the amount @xmath29 respectively and that the corresponding interaction picture operators take the form    @xmath30    @xmath31    finally we note that @xmath32 summing eq .",
    "( [ aconalfadiomega ] ) over all anergy differences and employing the completeness relation we get    @xmath33    the above positions enable us to cast the interaction hamiltonian into the following form @xmath34 the reason for introducing the eigenoperator decomposition , by virtue of which the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture can now be written as @xmath35 is that exploiting the rotating wave approximation , whose microscopic effect is to drop the terms for which @xmath36 , is equivalent to the schrodinger picture interaction hamiltonian : @xmath37    lemma [ th1 ] the rotating wave approximation imply the conservation of the free energy of the global system , that is @xmath38=0\\ ] ]      the necessary condition involved in the previous proposition is equivalent to the equation @xmath39=0 $ ] we are going to demonstrate .",

    "( [ com1],[com2 ] )    ' '' ''    lemma [ th2 ] the detailed balance condition in the thermodynamic limit imply @xcite @xmath41    where @xmath42    ' '' ''    corollary [ th3 ] let us suppose the temperature of the thermal reservoir to be the absolute zero , on the ground of lemma 2 immediately we see that @xmath43    let us now cast eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) in a slightly different form splitting the sum over the frequency , appearing in eq.([dissme ] ) , in a sum over the positive frequencies and a sum over the negative ones so to obtain    @xmath44    where we again make use of eq .",
    "( [ aconalfadiomega ] ) . in the above expression we can recognize the first term as responsible of spontaneous and stimulated emission processes , while the second one takes into account stimulated absorption , as imposed by the lowering and raising properties of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore if the reservoir is a thermal bath at @xmath2 the corollary 4 tell us that the correct dissipator of the master equation can be obtained by suppressing the stimulated absorption processes in eq .",
    "( [ diss ] ) .",
    "we are now able to solve the markovian master equation when the reservoir is in a thermal equilibrium state characterized by @xmath2 .",
    "we will solve a cauchy problem assuming the factorized initial condition to be an eigenoperator of the free energy @xmath46 .",
    "this hypothesis does nt condition the generality of the found solution being able to extend itself to an arbitrary initial condition because of the linearity of the markovian master equation .",
    "nud theorem [ th4 ] if eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) is the markovian master equation describing the dynamical evolution of a open quantum system s , coupled to an environment b , assumed to be in the detailed - balance thermal equilibrium state characterized by a temperature t=0 , and if the global system is initially prepared in a state @xmath47 so that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the free energy of the global system then @xmath3 is in the form of a piecewise deterministic process @xcite , that is a process obtained combining a deterministic time - evolution with a jump process .",
    "the weak - coupling assumption is equivalent to @xmath50 .",
    "the above equation can be used to derive the reduced density matrix @xmath51 tracing over the environment degree of freedom .",
    "let us choose a factorized base @xmath52 in the tensor product hilbert space made of eigenvectors of @xmath6 and @xmath17 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 define respectively the spectra of @xmath17 and @xmath6 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 their relative degenerations .",
    "let us remember that we have made the semplificative hypotheses of discreteness of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in addition we assume , also for easyness , that @xmath55 is bounded from below and made of isolated points . on the ground of these chioses",
    "the total density matrix can be written as @xmath58 imposes a strong selection rule on the indices of the summation , that is : @xmath59 by virtue of which the trace over the degrees of freedom of the environment , that can be written as latexmath:[\\ ] ] the environment - induced multipartite cooperation not - vanished by the loss of memory of the environment .    the found solution ( nud theorem ) tell us that the state of the system is a statistical mixture of the free energy system eigenoperators .",
    "this fact depends and it is consistent with the existence of the m - c measurement device because the act of measurement introduces a stochastic variable respect to which we can only predict the probability to have one or another of the possible alternative measures .",
    "these probabilities can be regarded as the weight of the possible alternative generalized trajectories and , analytically , they are given by the partial traces of the @xmath99 . with this approach",
    "the dynamics has to be depicted as a statistical mixture of this alternative generalized trajectories .",
    "moreover the found trajectories evolve in time in a deterministic way : for example the trajectory relative to the initially excited system state is a shifted free evolution characterized by complex frequencies that means an exponential decaying free evolution",
    ". this statement may give the sensation that every system has to decay in its ground state because of the observed dynamics .",
    "it is in general not true .",
    "actually , if the system is multipartite , it is possible that it admits excited and entangled equilibrium decoherence free subspace ( dfs ) ( so as it happens in a lot of known models ) , constituted by states on which the action of @xmath84 is identically zero and then , if the system , during evolution , passes through one of these states , the successive dynamics will be decoupled from the environment evolution .",
    "an equilibrium condition is reached in which entanglement is embedded in the system @xcite .    what could ensure , for example , that an entangled decoherence - free state , if existing , has been generated ?",
    "( for example ) the number of click we hear in a period of time long enough respect spontaneous emission rate . actually , if the numbers of the clicks is less than the numbers of initial excitations then we can say that it has been generated a decoherence - free state @xcite .",
    "if , on the contrary , the system is monopartite it is possible to demonstrate that the only possible dfs is generated by the ground state of the system so that a monopartite system will loose its internal coherence and the population of excited states because of the measurement and the consequent interaction with a memory - cleaned environment , unable to induce cooperation among the parts : there exists only one part ."
