    "the presence of disorder in spin systems represents a permanent source of challenging problems , due to the richness of physical properties that emerge from the interplay between disorder and many - spin interactions .",
    "random fields ( rfs ) and spin glass ( sg ) models are important examples of such richness  @xcite . furthermore , the combination of these two highly nontrivial manifestations of disorder leads to a fascinating area of research in spin systems , which is not only a theoretical possibility .",
    "actually , they can be found in diluted ising - like antiferromagnets , like fe@xmath8zn@xmath9f@xmath11 and fe@xmath8mg@xmath9cl@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent investigations have suggested the diluted ising - like dipolar ferromagnetic compound liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 as a new candidate presenting these two types of disorder , bringing novel interesting and controversial issues  .",
    "for instance , the liho@xmath12y@xmath13f@xmath10 compound , in the absence of an applied transverse field @xmath14 , displays @xmath0 ( the lowest term of the non - linear susceptibility @xmath15 ) with a sharp peak at the freezing temperature @xmath1 , which resembles a conventional second - order sg phase transition  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sharp peak of @xmath0 becomes increasingly rounded when @xmath14 is enhanced , being located at the temperature @xmath7 , which is lower than @xmath1 obtained in absence of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that an effective longitudinal rf can be induced by the interplay of a transverse applied field @xmath14 with the off - diagonal terms of the dipolar interactions in the liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10  @xcite brought a new push to clarify the controversies of the experimental behavior of @xmath0 and , therefore , the meaning of @xmath7 , i.e. , whether or not it is a true sg transition temperature . in the droplet picture used in refs .   and",
    ", the presence of a rf @xmath16 , induced by the uniform transverse field , suppresses the sg transition , for the same reason that an uniform field does it in that picture  @xcite . on the other hand , within the mean - field parisi s framework  @xcite , tabei and collaborators  @xcite , using a quantum version of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model  @xcite with additional off - diagonal interactions , longitudinal rf @xmath16 and a transverse field @xmath17 , succeeded in reproducing the @xmath0 experimental behavior .",
    "indeed , this result is a strong evidence that the rf plays an important role in the liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 compound .",
    "these authors also suggested that the sg quantum criticality is unlikely in this transverse field , induced longitudinal rf scenario ; additionally , susceptibility measurements presented evidence of a canonical sg behavior  @xcite . from that point of view , one can raise the question of what happens with the sg criticality in a regime where thermal fluctuations should be dominant as compared with the quantum ones ?",
    "one possible consequence of the transverse field , induced longitudinal rf , is that the almeida - thouless ( at ) line  @xcite can be suppressed , as suggested by numerical simulations in short - range - interaction sgs  @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies using mean - field parisi s framework have shown that the sk model with a rf does preserve the at line  @xcite .",
    "consequently , assuming that parisi s mean - field theory is a valid framework to describe the sg problem with a transverse field , induced longitudinal rf , one can also raise the question of how the behavior of @xmath0 can be related with the at line , when a rf is present in the sk model ?",
    "one can expect that the answer to this question may also help to clarify the meaning of the temperature @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , in this work we present a detailed investigation of the role of a rf in the behavior of @xmath0 and its relation to the at line in the sk model within the mean - field parisi s framework . in order to relate with experimental verifications on the liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 compound",
    ", we assume that @xmath14 is sufficiently small to assure that quantum fluctuations are negligible , but enough to guarantee that the effective field - induced rf @xmath16 is still appreciable .",
    "when @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , it is known that @xmath0 is related with the sg susceptibility , @xmath20_{\\rm av}~ ,   \\label{eqchisg}\\ ] ] where , as usual , @xmath21 and @xmath22_{\\rm av}$ ] denote respectively , thermal averages and an average over the disorder .",
    "the sg susceptibility has a term inversely proportional to the at eigenvalue @xmath2 , the so - called replicon  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the diverging behavior , @xmath23 , in the sg transition , is directly related with @xmath4 at @xmath1 , corresponding to the onset of replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .    however , the situation changes considerably when @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "for instance , the rf can induce directly the sg order parameter , but only in the replica - symmetric ( rs ) approximation , since the rf is unable to produce any rsb .",
    "this result was demonstrated not only for infinite - ranged spin interactions  @xcite , but also for the bethe lattice  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the smooth behavior of the sg rs order parameter @xmath26 is not appropriate for identifying a sg transition of the sk model in the presence of a random field ; however , such a transition may be related with the onset of rsb , associated with the replicon @xmath4  @xcite . in spite of this , the derivative of @xmath26 with respect to the temperature increases as one approaches @xmath27 from above ; such an increase is responsible for the rounded maximum in @xmath0 at a temperature @xmath7 , which does not coincide with the sg transition temperature @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath6 for a given applied random field ) .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath0 at @xmath7 should reflect the effects of the rf inside the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase , instead of the non - trivial ergodicity breaking of the sg phase transition .",
    "our results also suggest that @xmath0 still maintains a dependence on the replicon @xmath2 , although in a much more complicated way , as compared with the case without the rf .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and the analytical procedure to be used ; then , we calculate @xmath2 , the order parameters within the one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1s - rsb ) scheme , the susceptibilities @xmath28 , @xmath0 , as well as the temperature @xmath7 in the presence of rfs , following both gaussian and bimodal distributions . in section iii",
    "we discuss the numerical solutions of the saddle - point equations for the order parameters and susceptibilities .",
    "finally , the last section is reserved to the conclusions .",
    "herein we consider the infinite - range - interaction spin - glass model , defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 represents a uniform field , and the sum @xmath32 applies to all distinct pairs of spins .",
    "the spin - spin couplings @xmath33 and the magnetic random fields @xmath34 follow independent gaussian probability distributions , @xmath35^{1/2 }   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2 - c}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right ] , \\label{eq2a}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 may represent either couplings or random fields ; in the former case one has @xmath37 and @xmath38 , whereas in the later , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . we also consider a bimodal probability distribution , @xmath41 for the random fields @xmath34 . we follow closely",

    "it should be mentioned that , in the present work the results for the bimodal rf become independent of @xmath58 , which may be seen by means of a change of variables @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the bimodal distribution becomes completely equivalent to the one of a shifted uniform field , given by @xmath60 .",

    "it is important to remind also that griffiths singularities are found currently in disordered magnetic systems , like for site - diluted ferromagnets  @xcite , as well for a ferromagnet in a random field  @xcite .",
    "whether the region @xmath121 in the present problem may be related to this later type of behavior concerns a matter for further investigation .",
    "as already mentioned and addressed in several works  @xcite , in the absence of rfs , the sg phase transition is given by the divergence of @xmath0 at @xmath1 . in parisi s mean field theory this divergence is directly related with the onset of rsb , signaled by a zero of the replicon @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of rfs induce the sg order parameter @xmath26 in the pm phase , within the rs solution",

    "this longitudinal eigenvalue is related with the magnitude of the fluctuations of the of rs sg order parameter @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the maximum of @xmath0 at @xmath7 becomes completely unrelated with the sg phase transition when @xmath128 departs from zero , being directly associated with the longitudinal eigenvalue .",
    "the role of random fields on the spin - glass freezing temperature , as well as on the nonlinear susceptibility , was analyzed . for that",
    ", we have investigated the sherrington - kirkpatrick model in the presence of random fields , following a gaussian distribution characterized by a width @xmath128 , within a one - step replica - symmetry - breaking procedure .",
    "we have shown that the divergence in @xmath0 only occurs in the absence of random fields , and that @xmath0 exhibits a broad maximum at a temperature @xmath5 for @xmath129 .",
    "the freezing temperature @xmath1 is associated with the onset of replica - symmetry - breaking , signaled by the zero of the almeida - thouless ( replicon ) eigenvalue , occurring at lower temperatures , i.e. , @xmath99 for a given value of @xmath128 .",
    "the splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath7 , for @xmath129 , was studied by analyzing the contribution due to the random fields in the replica symmetry spin - glass order parameter .",
    "particularly , we have shown that the behavior of @xmath0 is not regulated only by the spin - spin correlations associated to the almeida - thouless line , but also to correlations coming from the longitudinal eigenvalue .",
    "these correlations play an important role inside the paramagnetic phase , when the random fields are applied , being responsible for the maximum in @xmath0 , although they are not directly associated with the spin - glass phase transition .",
    "although the present results refer a specific model , we expect they could shed some light in the theoretical and experimental description of disordered magnetic systems like , for instance , the compound liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 .",
    "considering recent observations in liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 , we follow the proposal that an applied transverse field @xmath14 induces longitudinal random fields  @xcite , and thus , we assume herein @xmath130 . in this way , one can interpret the present results , e.g. , the temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath1 , as manifestations of the transverse field .",
    "based on this , we point out below two possibilities , which may contribute to elucidate the recent controversies on this system  .",
    "( i ) the temperature @xmath5 associated with the rounded maximum in the nonlinear susceptibility does not signal any phase transition , being an effect of random fields inside the paramagnetic phase , although it is related to a minimum of the longitudinal eigenvalue , and hence , to large fluctuations in the replica - symmetric spin - glass order parameter .",
    "a true spin - glass phase transition , indicated through the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , by means of the almeida - thouless line , should occur at the lower temperature @xmath1 .",
    "( ii ) there is no spin - glass phase transition in liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 in the presence of a transverse field , implying that the replica - symmetry - breaking procedure does not apply to this compound .",
    "certainly , these two points require meticulous experimental observations for temperatures around @xmath5 , which has been the most investigated temperature region so far , as well as below @xmath5 , representing a challenge for experiments .",

    "<S> the sherrington - kirkpatrick model is studied through the replica formalism , within a one - step replica - symmetry - breaking procedure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the dependence of the almeida - thouless eigenvalue @xmath2 ( replicon ) on the random fields is analysed . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , in absence of random fields , the temperature @xmath1 can be traced by a divergence in the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath3 , which presents a term inversely proportional to the replicon @xmath2 . as a result of a relation between @xmath3 and @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the latter also presents a divergence at @xmath1 , which comes as a direct consequence of @xmath4 at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results show that , in the presence of random fields , @xmath0 presents a rounded maximum at a temperature @xmath5 , which does not coincide with the spin - glass transition temperature @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath6 for a given applied random field ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the maximum value of @xmath0 at @xmath7 reflects the effects of the random fields in the paramagnetic phase , instead of the non - trivial ergodicity breaking associated with the spin - glass phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that @xmath0 still maintains a dependence on the replicon @xmath2 , although in a more complicated way , as compared with the case without random fields . </S>",
    "<S> these results are discussed in view of recent observations in the liho@xmath8y@xmath9f@xmath10 compound .    </S>",
