    "this exactly characterises all @xmath0-regular matroids that are sufficiently ` rich ' and highly connected ; the equivalence of ( [ mainone ] ) and ( [ maintwo ] ) is strongly reminiscent of tutte s characterisation of regular matroids of the usual sort , and motivates our use of the word .",
    "this equivalence may hold for all matroids ( this has essentially been conjectured for @xmath27 in [ [ pvz ] , conjecture 6.8 ] ) , but the characterisation in ( [ mainthree ] ) requires some extra hypotheses , and we briefly discuss the ones we chose .",
