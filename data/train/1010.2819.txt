    "over an algebraically closed field @xmath2 of characteristic @xmath4 , finite algebraic branched covers @xmath5 with @xmath6 fixed branch points are in one - to - one correspondence with finite topological branched covers of the riemann sphere with @xmath6 fixed branch points .",
    "both correspond to finite index subgroups of @xmath7 , the free ( profinite ) group on @xmath8 generators .",
    "in particular , there exist no nontrivial covers of @xmath9 branched at one point ( hereafter called ",
    "one - point covers \" ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is algebraically closed of characteristic @xmath3 , the situation differs in two important ways .",
    "first , there exist many covers which do not have topological analogs .",
    "in particular , as a consequence of _ abhyankar s conjecture _ ( proven by raynaud ( @xcite ) in the case of the affine line and harbater ( @xcite ) in general ) , it follows that a finite group @xmath10 can be realized as the galois group of an @xmath6-point cover of @xmath9 exactly when @xmath11 can be generated by @xmath8 elements ( here , @xmath12 is the subgroup of @xmath10 generated by all of the @xmath3-sylow subgroups ) .",
    "thus , @xmath10 occurs as the galois group of a one - point cover iff @xmath13 .",
    "such a group is called _",
    "quasi-@xmath3_. the second major difference is that , unlike in characteristic zero , the genus of @xmath14 is not determined by the degree , ramification points , and ramification indices of @xmath15 , but also depends on wild ramification behavior at the ramification points .",
    "this behavior is encoded in the higher ramification filtration (  [ sram ] ) .    while abhyankar s conjecture guarantees existence of certain one - point @xmath10-covers",
    ", it does not provide examples .",
    "in particular , the question of what subgroups @xmath16 can occur as the inertia group of a @xmath10-galois one - point cover has been answered in only a few cases . by basic ramification theory",
    ", such a group @xmath17 must be of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a @xmath3-group and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 must also generate @xmath10 as a normal subgroup ( this is automatic , for instance , when @xmath10 is simple ) .",
    "_ abhyankar s inertia conjecture _",
    "( @xcite ) states that any @xmath17 satisfying these properties occurs as the inertia group of a one - point @xmath10-cover .",
    "this is known to be true for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for @xmath23 ( @xcite ) , and for @xmath24 when @xmath25 is an odd prime ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clearly true in some trivial cases , for instance when @xmath10 is abelian .",
    "however , outside of these cases , our knowledge is limited .",
    "abhyankar has constructed many examples of one - point @xmath10-covers with various inertia groups where @xmath10 is simple , but all of these examples are in cases where @xmath10 is alternating , sporadic , or of lie type over a field of characteristic @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath10 is a simple group with a cyclic @xmath3-sylow subgroup of order greater than @xmath3 ( such a group can not be alternating , sporadic , or of lie type over a field of characteristic @xmath3 ) , then as far as i know , no examples of one - point @xmath10-covers have been constructed , let alone with any particular inertia group .    in this paper , we investigate abhyankar s inertia conjecture for certain simple groups @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are odd primes . in this case , the group @xmath1 has a cyclic @xmath3-sylow subgroup of order @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . while we are not able to prove the conjecture in full ( see remark [ rabhyankar ] ) , we exhibit many examples with a wide variety of inertia groups :    let @xmath2 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath27 .",
