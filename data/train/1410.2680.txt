    "this problem as stated does in general not give a unique solution , hence assumptions are often made in order to find the flux @xcite .",

    "the stoichiometry of the network is examined by defining a finite set of pathways that gives a basis for the flux space , _",

    "it provides a way to quantify the flux over each efm . a macroscopic network ( @xmath22 )",

    "the macroscopic network has a corresponding flux vector @xmath23 , given by @xmath24 , that consists of the fluxes over each macroscopic reaction .",
    "the efms - based mfa problem is to fit the macroscopic metabolic network to the cell specific external flux measurements ( @xmath13 ) by adjusting the macroscopic fluxes ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "* chapter 5.2 ) .",
    "as the network size increases the number of efms , or any other minimal description like extreme pathways , explodes and enumeration becomes prohibitive @xcite .",
    "in efms - based mfa the whole set of efms is enumerated beforehand , making its application limited to simplified networks .",
    "to enable efm analysis of complex metabolic networks , methods that find only subset of the efms have been developed .",
    "the authors of @xcite presented a method that finds efms through a mixed integer linear program .",
    "a predetermined number of efms that use the fewest reactions are identified , meaning that the efms using a high number of reactions may seldom be included in this set .",
    "another method proposed by @xcite , and later improved on by @xcite , uses a sequence of linear optimization problems to find efms connected to specific external metabolites . identifying efms through a series of linear programming ( lp ) problems",
    "was also proposed by @xcite , where efms are identified in a random manner until the predetermined minimal number of efms are found .",
    "this method could be used to solve the efms - based mfa problem where multiple measurements are available ; for that three steps need to be taken .",
    "first , the flux vector @xmath2 is identified through least - squares data fitting , then the method could be used to decompose @xmath2 into the efms needed , and finally , the macroscopic flux vector @xmath23 can be calculated .    in this work we considered solving the efms - based mfa problem by a more integrated approach that does not require the enumeration of efms or estimation of the flux vector @xmath2 beforehand .",
    "instead , we imagined that only the efms needed to solve the problem could be extracted by using all external measurements directly ; this should enable the problem to be solved even when the network is so complex that total enumeration of efms is prohibitive . to achieve this",
    "we suggest a method that identifies efms in a dynamic fashion . the method is based on an optimization technique known as column generation , which enables efms to be identified in conjunction with solving the efms - based mfa problem .",
    "column generation is an established technique within optimization @xcite where two levels of optimization problems are solved iteratively , a master problem and a subproblem . in this work",
    "the master problem is a quadratic optimization problem on the same form as the efms - based mfa problem , however , only a subset of the efms is used .",
    "the subproblem is an lp problem that identifies efms that further improve the data fitting in the master problem .",

    "an extreme ray is a ray in the cone that can not be written as a non - negative linear combination of two other rays in the cone . in this sense",

    "the comparison in figure [ fig : resext ] shows that several external metabolites were fitted better by network 2 , while a few remain at the same level as with network 1 .",
    "we have presented a method that solves the efms - based mfa problem without enumerating the whole set of efms .",
    "the method was derived using column generation .",
    "this technique is well established in other fields ; however , its application to efms - based mfa is to the best of our knowledge new . through the use of this technique , a smaller set of efms",
    "is generated while still ensuring convergence of the efms - based mfa problem to an optimal solution , even for a complex network .",
    "in other words , the method returns the same optimal objective value that would have been achieved if the whole set of efms was known .",
    "this enables more complex networks to be used when analyzing the cell metabolism .",
    "it should be noted that the subset of efms obtained through our method is not necessarily unique .",
    "hence , another subset of efms could be found that fits the data in an equally good way . nevertheless , obtaining a small set of efms relevant to external measurements based on a complex network",
    "can provide an indication of what pathways are important . to obtain a unique and globally optimal solution a regularized version of the efms - based mfa problem could be solved , _ i.e. ,  _",
    "@xmath111 where @xmath112 is some small enough positive number .",
    "however , the regularization of @xmath23 with respect to the 2-norm will predispose the solution to include a higher number of efms , each with lower flux ( @xmath113 ) . in modeling applications ,",
    "a smaller set of relevant efms may be more desirable since it could mean that fewer parameters need to be estimated .",
    "furthermore , the unique solution obtained through the regularization does not necessarily imply that solution to be more relevant than other solutions of the efms - based mfa problem .",

    "@xcite , any such tool will become infeasible with increased network complexity . consequently , focus has shifted from total enumeration of efms for complex networks to extracting a subset with certain desired properties .",

    "it generates a subset of efms through a series of optimization problems using a pre - calculated flux vector @xmath2 as a guide .",
    "compared to @xcite the column generation method does not require the pre - calculation of the flux vector @xmath2 since external measurements are taken directly into account . additionally , we can find solutions with fewer efms than the predetermined minimal number found by @xcite .",
    "finally , compared to the previously mentioned methods our method presented a more integrated approach , where identifying efms is done in conjunction with solving the efms - based mfa problem .    in the case - study , small subsets of efms and corresponding macroscopic fluxes",
    "were obtained for both networks at a low computational cost .",
    "the case study implies that the method is effective , since there was only a single unnecessary iteration for network 1 and no unnecessary iteration for network 2 .",
    "this indicates that the efms - based mfa problem , with network 2 , was solved to optimality through solving 26 lp s and 25 quadratic optimization problems .",
    "even though the networks have many efms only a fraction of those were needed to fit the data in an optimal way .",
    "our method allowed the use of a network of higher complexity , which improved the fit between estimated fluxes and data as the norm for several external fluxes was greatly reduced .",
    "this result highlights the value of being able to keep a certain level of network complexity while avoiding simplifications forced by computational limitations .",
    "our approach has the potential to find relevant efms of even larger networks than is presented in this work , thereby increasing the size of problems that can be handled by efms - based mfa .",

    "<S> it was demonstrated that the efms - based mfa problem could be solved at a low computational cost , even for the more complex network . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , only a fraction of the total number of efms was needed to compute the optimal solution .    </S>",
