    "the advent of wide - field time - domain surveys like the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; ps1 ) , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) has led to the discovery of a growing number of `` superluminous '' supernovae ( slsne ) , characterized by luminosities @xmath5 times larger than ordinary type ia and core - collapse sne . their spectra are diverse , though distinct subclasses are emerging ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , members of the subclass of the slsne that show hydrogen in their spectra can be classified as type iin sne , with the origin of the extreme luminosity being interaction with a dense circumstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the slsne without hydrogen ,",
    "however , the energy source(s ) remains a matter of debate .",
    "many of these objects form a spectroscopic subclass characterized by a blue continuum with a few broad rest - frame uv absorption features from intermediate - mass elements ; in some cases the spectra develop ic features at late times @xcite .",
    "an interaction scenario similar to the h - rich slsne has been proposed for these objects as well @xcite , but this requires extreme mass loss episodes ( @xmath6 ) shortly before the explosion and may be at odds with the lack of intermediate - width lines seen in the spectra @xcite .",
    "another proposed mechanism is energy injection by a newborn , rapidly - spinning magnetar @xcite , which can explain a wide range of luminosities and timescales @xcite .",
    "other h - poor slsne , most notably sn2007bi , have been proposed to be examples of pair - instability sne @xcite , but this interpretation is controversial and the events can also be explained in an interaction or magnetar scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "the superluminous sn ps1 - 10afx did not resemble any previously seen slsne , and may represent a new class of transients @xcite ; its unusual properties lead @xcite to conclude that it may have been a lensed type ia sn rather than a slsn .",
    "an important clue to the origin of the h - poor slsne may come from their host galaxy properties .",
    "an early study by @xcite utilized galex near - uv and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath7-band photometry of slsn hosts , and used this to argue for a preference for low - luminosity ( and by extension , possibly low - metallicity ) galaxies .",
    "however , this study was limited in several ways .",
    "first , all slsne were analyzed as a group regardless of spectral properties .",
    "second , it was based on limited data : of the seven h - poor slsn hosts considered , only three were actually detected in either of the two photometric bands they considered .",
    "third , it relied on the luminosities in only two bands to draw inferences about underlying properties of interest ( e.g. metallicity ) , which were not measured directly",
    ". a possible trend of low - metallicity galaxies was also pointed out by @xcite , who determined the metallicities for two slsn host galaxies , and found them to be low and comparable to the host galaxies of long - duration gamma - ray burst ( lgrbs)(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , detailed studies of the host galaxies of two individual h - poor slsne @xcite revealed low metallicities and high specific star formation rates , similar to lgrb host galaxies .    despite these initial results",
    "it is clear that to fully examine the physical properties of slsn host environments , make a meaningful comparison to other classes of transients and draw conclusions about the progenitors requires several key improvements on the existing data .",
    "first , high - quality spectroscopic data and optical / nir photometric data are needed to accurately determine the host galaxy luminosities , stellar masses , metallicities , star formation rates ( sfrs ) and specific sfrs .",
    "second , a comprehensive study , examining the slsn host galaxies as a population rather than a few individual objects is essential . with the large number of slsne being discovered by pan - starrs and other surveys ,",
    "this is now feasible .",
    "here , we present such observations and analysis of a sample of 31 slsn hosts , spanning a redshift range of @xmath0 .",
    "our sample includes 15 objects from the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey ( ps1/mds ) , and 16 targets from other surveys available in the literature .",
    "we only include hosts of h - poor slsne , as the energy source of type iin slsne is better understood and possibly distinct from the h - poor slsne .",
    "we do however include all types of h - poor slsne , so as not to make any initial assumptions about potentially different energy sources .",
    "this is the most comprehensive systematic study of slsn hosts so far .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our sample of slsn hosts and follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we describe our comparison samples and statistical methods in section  [ sec : samples ] .",
    "we detail how the various galaxy properties are derived from the data , and discuss them in section  [ sec : galprop ] .",
    "implications for the progenitors and caveats are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] , and we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume a @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our sample consists of 15 h - poor slsne discovered in the ps1/mds transient search . to supplement the ps1 sample , which covers the redshift range @xmath13",
    ", we also include events from the literature , extending the redshift coverage down to @xmath14 and bringing the total number of targets up to 31 .",
    "table  [ tab : gallist ] lists all targets , including references to the sn discoveries .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define a h - poor slsn as a sn with a peak absolute magnitude @xmath15 , and without evidence of hydrogen in the spectrum .",
    "the majority of objects belong to the subclass of slsne with spectra resembling sn2005ap and scp06f6 @xcite .",
    "however , we include other h - poor slsne such as sn2007bi @xcite and ps1 - 10afx @xcite , to explore their environments and relation to the other events .",
    "the ps1 telescope on haleakala is a high - etendue wide - field survey instrument with a 1.8-m diameter primary mirror and a @xmath16 diameter field of view imaged by an array of sixty @xmath17 pixel detectors , with a pixel scale of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the observations are obtained through five broadband filters ( @xmath19 ) ; details of the filters and photometric system are described in @xcite .",
    "the ps1/mds consists of 10 fields ( each with a single ps1 imager footprint ) observed in @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23with a typical cadence of 3  d in each filter , to a @xmath24 depth of @xmath25 mag ; @xmath26is used near full moon with a typical depth of @xmath27 mag .",
    "the standard reduction , astrometric solution , and stacking of the nightly images is done by the pan - starrs1 image processing pipeline ( ipp ) system @xcite on a computer cluster at the maui high performance computer center .",
    "the nightly mds stacks are transferred to the harvard fas research computing cluster , where they are processed through a frame subtraction analysis using the photpipe pipeline developed for the supermacho and essence surveys @xcite .",
    "a subset of targets is chosen for spectroscopic follow - up , using blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt telescope @xcite , the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8-m gemini telescopes , and the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) and inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) on the 6.5 m magellan telescopes . since the beginning of the survey in 2010",
    ", we have discovered over 15 slsne in the ps1/mds data ( @xcite ; lunnan et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the combination of a relatively small survey area and deep photometry provides sensitivity primarily to slsne at higher redshifts ; the current sample spans @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the ps1 sample is a great complement to the slsne from other surveys , which are generally found at @xmath29 due to shallower photometry ( figure  [ fig : rmag_z ] ) .    while ps1/mds is an untargeted survey the spectroscopic follow - up is not complete .",
    "the slsne in our sample were targeted by some combination of light curve and host properties , in particular for having long observed rise times , or standing out as being several magnitudes brighter than any apparent host .",
    "we discuss to what extent selection effects may affect our results in section  [ sec : sel ] .",
    "in addition to the ps1/mds slsne , we also include in our sample h - poor slsne reported by other surveys , most notably the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; @xcite ) , the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite ) and the robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotse - iii ; @xcite )",
    ". table  [ tab : gallist ] lists these objects , with references . since",
    "not all of the objects in this list have published spectra available , we include objects that are reported with a peak absolute magnitude @xmath30 , and classified as type ic or described as having a spectrum similar to known h - poor slsne .        for targets from the ps1/mds slsn sample",
    ", we stack the pre - explosion images and obtain deep @xmath19 photometry of the host galaxies .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : ps1phot ] .",
    "in addition , a number of the literature hosts are detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and we use available dr9 model magnitudes for these objects @xcite .    to complement the survey photometry , we obtained deep imaging observations of a number of targets that were either not covered by or undetected in either ps1/mds or sdss .",
    "this was mainly done with ldss and imacs on magellan , as well as with mmtcam , an f/5 imager on the 6.5 m mmt telescope .",
    "we processed and stacked all images using standard routines in iraf .",
    "we measured host galaxy magnitudes using aperture - matched photometry , with zeropoints determined either from observations of standard star fields taken at similar airmass on the same night , or from photometry of stars with listed sdss and/or ps1/mds magnitudes . in cases where the host galaxy was not detected , a @xmath31 upper limit was determined by measuring the mean magnitude of objects at the detection threshold ( s / n of 3 ) .",
    "images of the hosts are shown in figures  [ fig : galpix ] and [ fig : hstpix ] with the instrument and filter noted on each image .",
    "all non - ps1 and non - sdss photometry is listed in table  [ tab : morephot ] , and the host galaxy apparent magnitude distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : rmag_z ] as a function of redshift .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      there are a number of metallicity indicators available in the literature , depending on redshift range and the detected emission lines .",
    "however , there are known systematic offsets between them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore focus on the r@xmath32 diagnostic , which is available over the entire redshift range of interest , and we use the calibration in @xcite .",
    "this ensures consistent comparison within the slsn host sample , and to other galaxy samples using the same diagnostics .",
    "r@xmath32 is a double - valued diagnostic , and additional information is needed to break the degeneracy between the high - z and low - z branches .",
    "we accomplish this in either of the following ways .",
    "first , if the [ ] @xmath334363 line is detected , we assume the lower - metallicity branch , as this temperature - sensitive line is not present at high metallicities .",
    "second , when detected , we use the ratio of [ ] @xmath336584 to [ ] @xmath333727 ( or [ ] @xmath336584 to h@xmath34 , if the reddening is not well constrained ) to break the degeneracy . in some cases ,",
    "[ ] @xmath336584 is not detected , but the upper limit on this ratio is sufficiently low to allow us to place the host galaxy on the lower metallicity branch .",
    "finally , in some cases the value of r@xmath32 falls in the turnover region , and either branch gives a value in the range @xmath35 .",
    "if we can not formally break the degeneracy , both possible values are listed .",
    "however , we note that the low masses of most slsn host galaxies ( @xmath36 ) suggest that the lower branch solution is more likely over the supersolar metallicity given by the upper - branch solution . indeed , of the eight galaxies where we can robustly break the degeneracy , only one ( mls121104 ) is found to lie on the upper branch .    in galaxies",
    "where the auroral [ ] @xmath334363 line is detected we can also calculate a `` direct '' metallicity through the electron temperature ( @xmath37 ) method .",
    "we use the temden task in the iraf nebular package @xcite to determine the temperature of o@xmath38 and the electron density ( @xmath39 ) , from the ratio of the [ ] lines and [ ] lines respectively . the o@xmath40 temperature is then calculated assuming the relation from @xcite . finally , we determine o@xmath41h and o@xmath42h using the relations in @xcite .",
    "four galaxies in our sample have detected [ ] @xmath334363 emission : ps1 - 10bzj @xcite , sn2010gx @xcite , sn2011ke and ptf12dam .",
    "the host of ptf12dam exhibits both auroral [ ] and [ ] lines ; a detailed analysis of this host will be presented in chen et al .",
    "( in preparation )",
    ".    the distribution of r@xmath32 metallicities is plotted in figure  [ fig : metal_dist ] .",
    "as we can not formally break the r@xmath32 degeneracy in a number of cases , the dotted and dashed lines show what the distribution would be if we assumed all upper - branch or all lower - branch solutions for these galaxies .",
    "the solid lines assume the lower branch solution for host galaxies with a stellar mass lower than @xmath43 , and an equal probability of lower / upper branch solutions for the remaining objects . taking this as the best estimate of the true distribution",
    ", we find a median metallicity of 8.35 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : metal_dist ] are lgrb hosts , and hosts of type ib / c and ic - bl ( broad - lined ) sne from untargeted surveys @xcite .",
    "the slsn host metallicity distribution is statistically consistent with that of the lgrb hosts and inconsistent with the sn ib / c hosts , which are generally found at higher metallicities .",
    "we note that the sn samples shown here are local ( median redshift @xmath45 ) , as the goods ccsn sample does not have metallicity measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : mz_r23 ] shows the slsn hosts with metallicity measurements on a mass - metallicity ( m - z ) diagram , compared to lgrb host galaxies , the local m - z relation from sdss @xcite , local core - collapse sn host galaxies from the compilation of @xcite , and a sample of emission - line selected galaxies at redshift @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the slsn hosts are predominantly found at low masses and metallicities , although there is clearly a wide range  the host of mls121104 , for example , has well detected [ ] lines that place it on the upper branch in the r@xmath32 diagnostic , at approximately solar metallicity .",
    "this shows that any metallicity preference in producing slsne does not take the form of an absolute cutoff ; the same is true for lgrbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that two of the host galaxies with the highest measured metallicities ( mls121104 and ptf11rks ) also exhibit some of the largest offsets from the galaxy center to the sn explosion site ( figure  [ fig : galpix ] ) . if there are metallicity gradients present in these hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is still possible that the sne exploded in an environment with a lower metallicity , closer to the median of the slsn host sample .",
    "indeed , when comparing line ratios along the slit in the host of ptf11rks , we do find indications of a decreasing r@xmath32 ratio in an extraction region in the outskirts compared to at the center of the galaxy",
    ". however , the poor signal - to - noise ratio in the h@xmath47 line prevents us from making a more quantitative statement .",
    "we also note that the majority of our galaxies are of such a small angular size ( figure  [ fig : galpix ] ) that in most cases there is little practical difference between metallicity determined for the galaxy as a whole compared to the explosion site .",
    "degeneracy ; the dashed and dotted line shows the resulting distributions if we assume that all of the hosts reside on the lower or upper branches , respectively .",
    "the solid line is the resulting distribution when assuming hosts with a stellar mass @xmath48 fall on the low - metallicity branch , and assigning equal probability to the upper / lower branch solutions for the rest .",
    "this distribution is statistically consistent with the lgrb host galaxies , but not with the type ib / c sn hosts .",
    "[ fig : metal_dist],width=336 ]     ( orange diamonds ) .",
    "all metallicities are on the @xcite scale to facilitate comparison .",
    "points joined by lines represent cases where the r@xmath32 degeneracy could not be formally resolved , and so both the upper- and lower - branch solutions are plotted .",
    "[ fig : mz_r23],width=336 ]",
    "we have shown that the h - poor slsne are preferentially found in low - luminosity , low - mass , low - metallicity hosts with high ssfr and evidence for very young stellar populations based on line ews . however , as these properties are found to be correlated in the general galaxy population , it is not clear which is the driving factor in producing slsne .",
    "this is an on - going debate regarding lgrbs , and many of the same arguments are relevant to the slsne .",
    "a number of factors point toward metallicity being a key ingredient in producing both h - poor slsne and lgrbs .",
    "they overall show a preference for low - metallicity environments compared to ccsne as well as a preference for faint , blue irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "if star formation were the only factor required for producing slsne , we would expect them to also occur in star - forming regions of more massive galaxies , and so their galaxy distribution to be more similar to the goods ccsn sample .",
    "we also note that the potential redshift evolution we see in our slsn host sample is consistent with a metallicity - based selection : since the mass - metallicity relation evolves with redshift , shifting to lower metallicities for a given stellar mass at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , we expect a trend toward lower - mass galaxies at lower redshift for a given metallicity .",
    "this is indeed what we observe for the slsn hosts ( figures  [ fig : mbdist ] and [ fig : massdist ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", we do observe a range of metallicities in the slsn host galaxies , and we do not find evidence of a metallicity cutoff ; the same is true for lgrb hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while there are lgrb hosts at higher metallicities , as a population they tend to fall below the local m - z relation ( figure  [ fig : mz_r23 ] ) .",
    "it has been argued that this could be a result of a proposed anticorrelation between sfr and metallicity at a given stellar mass ; the driving factor then would be star formation rather than metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , even when taking into account the lgrbs in heavily dust - obscured galaxies , the number of lgrbs in massive galaxies still falls short of what would be expected in a purely star formation - selected sample @xcite , suggesting that the lgrb rate is also a function of metallicity . a similar argument",
    "can be made for slsne : while it is not clear whether they fall below the m - z relation ( figure  [ fig : mz_r23 ] ) , they do exclusively populate the low - mass end of this diagram . regardless of whether they are low - metallicity for their mass ,",
    "then , they are clearly not simply following the star - forming population .    in terms of progenitor models , a low - metallicity environment preference could be linked to a requirement for high angular momentum in the core .",
    "rotation is thought to be the link between lgrbs and metallicity from the theoretical side , where the grb is a result of accretion onto a newly formed black hole , following the collapse of a rapidly rotating , massive star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "higher metallicities are associated with increased mass loss through stellar winds @xcite which strips the core of angular momentum , and so it has been proposed that the observed preference for low - metallicity environments for lgrbs is linked to the need to maintain high rotation @xcite . a similar argument can be applied to the h - poor slsne in the scenario where the energy source is a magnetar : in order to reproduce the observed timescales and luminosities rapid initial neutron star spin is required , as well as a strong magnetic field @xcite . alternatively , the central engine could also be a black hole , where large core angular momentum could allow material which remains bound in the explosion to form an accretion disk and inject energy into the supernova @xcite .",
    "however , this line of reasoning does not explain how the slsn progenitors shed their hydrogen envelopes and why that mechanism would not remove angular momentum ; this is a puzzle also regarding lgrbs , which are associated with ic - bl sne .",
    "we note that while slsne and lgrbs seem to be found in similar environments , it does not follow that their progenitors must share common properties , but rather that the environmental causes for producing massive stars that end their lives as a lgrb or slsn are likely similar .",
    "for example , if the high - mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) varies with environment ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , that could potentially explain the trends we see without needing to invoke a metallicity dependence .",
    "another possibility is dynamical effects : @xcite speculate that both lgrbs and slsne are end products of different dynamical processes in young , dense star clusters , with slsne being the result of runaway stellar collisions  our findings at least support their premise that both slsne and lgrbs are associated with young star - forming regions .    due to the expected suppression of stellar winds in low - metallicity progenitors",
    ", one might initially expect that an interaction model would be harder to explain in a low - metallicity context .",
    "however , the mass loss required to explain the observed light curves of slsne is too large to be explained by line - driven stellar winds @xcite . a proposed alternative mechanism for ejecting the necessary mass shells is a pulsational pair - instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a phenomenon that may be sensitive to both the rotation and metallicity of the progenitor .",
    "a binary star channel has also been proposed @xcite , where the mass loss is driven by common envelope evolution of a compact object within the envelope of a massive star , and the sn itself is triggered by inspiral of the compact object to the core of the companion star , though it is not clear why such a channel would be environment - dependent as we are finding in this work .",
    "we note that whatever the scenario , at the very least our findings suggest that if h - poor slsne are powered by strong circumstellar interaction , the mechanism that causes the mass loss is likely to be operating preferentially in low - metallicity environments .        while we have taken care to compare events from untargeted surveys over a similar redshift range , one might worry that selection effects could still be driving the differences we see between the slsn hosts and the other galaxy populations .",
    "one such effect is that the slsn host sample is likely to be biased against host galaxies with high extinction , since it is selected for hosting a population of blue optical transients .",
    "this is consistent with what we find in our sed fits , in that virtually all the host galaxies in our sample are consistent with zero or moderate extinction ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this may partially explain the marginally significant difference in galaxy luminosities seen between the slsn and lgrb hosts , since lgrbs are selected via gamma - rays and therefore much less sensitive to dust extinction .",
    "the mid - ir transient sdwfs - mt-1 was proposed to be a dust - enshrouded slsn ( though of unknown type ; @xcite ) , suggesting that there may exist a population of these objects in obscured environments that current optical surveys are missing .",
    "this would only impact our result if such a population was hosted in significantly different galaxies , however ; in this one known case , the host was still a low - metallicity dwarf galaxy .",
    "extinction is unlikely to explain the difference between the slsn hosts and the ccsn sample though , as this sample is also selected optically and would suffer from a similar extinction bias .",
    "conversely , if the slsn hosts were indeed drawn from the same population as ccsn hosts , it would mean that current surveys are only detecting a small fraction of the slsne  only @xmath50% of the goods ccsne were found in galaxies fainter than @xmath51 , the median of the slsn host galaxy sample .",
    "as explored in section  [ sec : followup ] , we do not consider this to be a likely scenario .",
    "we also note that while all the samples we are comparing come from untargeted surveys , the spectroscopic follow - up is not complete . in selecting the subsample of objects that will be followed up and confirmed spectroscopically ,",
    "both light curve and host galaxy properties are typically considered , and this could therefore introduce biases based on host galaxy properties . here",
    ", we can only address how the ps1/mds sample was selected .",
    "the targets included in this paper were primarily chosen for spectroscopic follow - up by some combination of long rise times and/or being significantly brighter than any apparent host .",
    "the former effect arises both due to the intrinsically long rise of many slsne , as well as due to time dilation since the redshift distribution of the ps1/mds sample peaks at @xmath52 .",
    "this selection could bias us toward lower - luminosity galaxies if faster - rising slsne were preferentially found in brighter host galaxies ; exploring any such correlations is , however , outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the second effect of preferentially following up faint - host / high - contrast objects is potentially more problematic for the results presented here .",
    "we know that our sample is not complete  the question is whether we missed objects systematically due to galaxy properties , and if so , whether the effect is large enough to influence our results . to quantify this",
    ", we carried out a number of tests .",
    "first , if we assume that the true distribution of slsn host galaxies was that of the goods ccsn host galaxies , we can simulate the effects of a ( crude ) selection bias by excluding all the ccsn host galaxies brighter than a given magnitude , and ask what fraction of objects we must be missing .",
    "we find that to make the goods ccsn host galaxy mass distribution marginally consistent with that of the slsn host galaxies , we must set the cut at @xmath53 , excluding half of the goods sample .",
    "this implies that if selection effects were the only driver behind our result , we should have systematically missed about half of the slsne in ps1/mds .    to quantify how many such potential bright - host slsne we could have missed , we searched the entire ps1/mds photometric database for transients that had good - quality light curves ( bright enough to be considered for spectroscopy ) and long observed rise times , but that were not selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we excluded from this sample any object that had a light curve consistent with a type ia sn , as determined by psnid @xcite .",
    "we tuned our cuts such that the search would let through all the ps1 slsne where the rise is observed , with the exception of the fastest - rising objects such as ps1 - 10bzj @xcite .",
    "applying the same light curve cuts to the spectroscopic subsample , we found that in addition to slsne the main group of objects making it through these cuts are type ii sne at lower redshifts ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "for the time period we considered , this left us with 17 long - rising transients without spectroscopic classification .",
    "13 of these have host galaxies that are well - detected in sdss , and thus have photometric redshifts available @xcite .",
    "if we adopt these redshifts , the median implied peak absolute magnitude of these transients is @xmath55 , consistent with being the counterparts to the slow - rising type ii sne seen in the spectroscopic control sample , and in particular unlikely to be missed slsne .",
    "this leaves us with only four candidates of unknown type / redshift , which already rules out having missed a considerable number of bright - host slsne simply due to a bias in the follow - up .",
    "two of these four objects were actually targeted for spectroscopy , but the spectra were inconclusive , showing a blue and featureless continuum .",
    "it is unlikely that these objects belong to the subclass studied in this paper - if they were indeed superluminous , they would be at sufficiently high redshift that we would expect to detect the characteristic broad uv absorption features seen in most h - poor slsne @xcite .",
    "in addition , these four remaining objects are all found in host galaxies fainter than @xmath56 ( two have undetected hosts ) and so would not be bright - host slsne : if we assign them redshifts by assuming the transients were indeed slsne ( i.e. , that the transient light curves peaked at @xmath57 ) , adding them to the sample considered in this paper does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "therefore , we are confident that our results are due to a real effect , rather than a bias towards preferentally following up transients with faint host galaxies .",
    "we note that the preference for low - luminosity hosts is even stronger in the low - redshift non - ps1/mds sample .",
    "this is reassuring , in the sense that the same general trend is found independently by more than one survey , which is certainly a necessary condition for it being a real physical effect .",
    "the stronger preference for low - luminosity galaxies at lower redshifts can be interpreted as an evolutionary effect , that may come about if for example metallicity affects the slsn rate . without a better understanding of",
    "how the different surveys select targets for follow - up , disentangling any selection effects from redshift evolution will be difficult , however .",
    "we have presented the first comprehensive study of the host galaxy environments of h - poor slsne , with 31 objects over the redshift range @xmath58 .",
    "this is the first study to look at the hosts of this subclass of slsne specifically , and the largest study of slsn hosts so far : previous studies @xcite mixed both h - rich and h - poor slsne and only detected a few hosts of h - poor slsne .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    * h - poor slsne are generally found in low - luminosity galaxies . in our sample , we find the following median properties : @xmath59-band luminosity of @xmath60  mag , stellar mass of @xmath61 , star formation rate of @xmath62 and specific star formation rate of @xmath63 . * compared to the hosts of core - collapse sne over the same redshift range , the slsne occur systematically in lower - luminosity , lower - mass , lower - metallicity and higher ssfr galaxies .",
    "these results are statistically significant at the @xmath64 level . * compared to the hosts of lgrbs over the same redshift range , the slsne are consistent with being drawn from the same galaxy population as grbs in terms of stellar mass , sfr , ssfr , and metallicity ; we do , however , find them in lower - luminosity and lower - mass galaxies particularly at low redshift .",
    "* the slsne predominantly occur in low - metallicity galaxies , with a median value of @xmath65 and four galaxies in the sample having a detected [ ] @xmath66 emission line .",
    "however , we do find a range of metallicities , including a host galaxy at solar metallicity , and so there is no evidence for a strict metallicity cutoff . *",
    "the preference for low - luminosity galaxies is strongest in the low - redshift ( @xmath29 ) sample , suggesting that there could be redshift evolution in the host population .",
    "a better understanding of how this sample was selected is necessary to disentangle evolution effects and potential selection effects , however .",
    "we have shown that slsne select host environments that are similar to those selected by lgrbs over the same redshift range , though seem to prefer even lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "as is the case with lgrbs , the implications in terms of slsn progenitors are not straightforward . however",
    ", if interpreted as a preference for low - metallicity environments as the effect driving the selection , this could lend support to a millisecond magnetar being the energy source powering slsne . a key component of this progenitor model",
    "is that the magnetar must initially be spinning at close to breakup speeds , and maintaining fast rotation in the core is thought to be more effective at low metallicities since less angular momentum is lost to line - driven stellar winds .",
    "it is less clear how our findings could be interpreted in the context of an interaction model for powering slsne , but our results at least indicate that the mechanism responsible for mass loss is likely to be environment - dependent .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the results to our study to the host galaxies of hydrogen - rich ( type iin ) slsne , since these slsne do show clear signs of interaction in their sn spectra .",
    "if their host population is found to be similar to the h - poor slsn hosts , this could point to a similar progenitor population for the two classes .",
    "we thank the staffs at ps1 , mmt and magellan for their assistance with performing these observations , and andy monson for help with processing the fourstar data .",

    "<S> we present optical spectroscopy and optical / near - ir photometry of 31 host galaxies of hydrogen - poor superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) , including 15 events from the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey . </S>",
    "<S> our sample spans the redshift range @xmath0 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specific subclass of cosmic explosions . combining the multi - band photometry and emission - line measurements , we determine the luminosities , stellar masses , star formation rates and metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as a whole , the hosts of slsne are a low - luminosity ( @xmath1 ) , low stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) population , with a high median specific star formation rate @xmath3 . the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low , @xmath4 , although at least one host galaxy has solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxies of h - poor slsne are statistically distinct from the hosts of goods core - collapse sne ( which cover a similar redshift range ) , but resemble the host galaxies of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) in terms of stellar mass , sfr , ssfr and metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbs are similar , and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in low metallicity environments . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the key ingredient is large core angular momentum , leading to a rapidly - spinning magnetar in slsne and an accreting black hole in lgrbs . </S>"
