    "thus , metal content , typically measured through the gas - phase oxygen abundance ( o / h ) , the most abundant heavy element produced by massive stars , can be used to assess a galaxy s evolutionary state .",
    "the integrated star - formation activity over the lifetime of the galaxy is measured by stellar mass , while the star - formation rate ( sfr ) measures how much gas is being converted into stars over the time scale of the sfr indicator .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity ( @xmath5 ) quantifies the production of metals from high - mass stars , but also indicates the degree to which galaxies interact with their environment through gas accretion and outflows in the form of galactic winds .",

    "it is generally agreed that the high - redshift relations of both the mzr and the sfms are similar in form to the local ones , but they show different normalizations : at a given m@xmath0 , sfr ( and ssfr ) increases with increasing redshift while metallicity decreases . moreover ,",

    "however , depending on their mass , they move at different velocities along the track : the most massive observed galaxies are very evolved with a large specific age ( i.e. , in units of the star formation timescale ) and move essentially along constant metallicity curves ; smaller objects are younger and are still gently building up their metal content",

    "<S> recent work suggests that galaxy evolution , and the build - up of stellar mass ( m@xmath0 ) over cosmic time , is characterized by changes with redshift of star formation rate ( sfr ) and oxygen abundance ( o / h ) . in a companion paper , we have compiled a large dataset to study metallicity evolution and galaxy assembly ( mega ) , consisting of @xmath11000 galaxies to @xmath2 with a common o / h calibration . </S>",
    "<S> here we interpret the mega scaling relations of m@xmath0 , sfr , and o / h with an updated version of the model presented by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model successfully reproduces the observed o / h ratio of @xmath180000 galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey to within 0.05@xmath30.06dex . by extending the model to the higher redshift mega sample </S>",
    "<S> , we find that although the specific mass loading of outflows does not change measurably during the evolution , the accretion rate and gas content of galaxies increase significantly with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects can explain , either separately or possibly in tandem , the observed lower metal abundance of high-@xmath4 galaxies .    </S>",
