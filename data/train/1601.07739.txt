    "one of the most important tasks in copula modeling is to decide which specific copula to employ . for that purpose",
    "a rather general approach is to use omnibus goodness - of - fit tests that require minimum assumptions , for recent reviews see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "other more specific avenues consist in applying graphical tools ( @xcite ) or information based criteria ( @xcite ) . in fully parametric models , as considered in this paper , the latter can be formulated in terms of functions of the fisher information matrices , which will allow us to generate optimal designs for copula model discrimination .",
    "design optimization is generally largely employed in many applied fields as a convenient tool to improve drawing informative experiments .",
    "recently , in @xcite the theory of @xmath1-optimality has been extended to a wider class of models for the usage of copulas .",
    "although the employment of such functions allows for a substantial flexibility in modeling , it also leads to the natural question of their ( proper ) choice . as stated",
    ", developments of powerful goodness - of - fit tests and strategies to avoid the wrong choice of the dependence constitute a considerable part of the literature on copulas .",
    "the issue of model choice or discrimination is in principle also a well known part of ( optimum ) experimental design theory and several criteria ( e.g. , @xmath0-optimality , @xmath2-optimality , @xmath3-optimality ) have been proposed ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a special application to copula models ) .    in this work",
    "we first extend the general theory of @xmath4-optimality to copula models . then",
    ", we present the usage of the @xmath0-criterion to discriminate between various classes of dependences and possible scenarios . finally , we show through some examples possible real applications .",
    "in this section we provide the extension for the @xmath4-criterion of a kiefer - wolfowitz type equivalence theorem , assuming the dependence described by a copula model .",
    "we then illustrate the basic idea of the new approach through a motivating example already analyzed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a vector @xmath5 of control variables , where @xmath6 is a compact set .",
    "the results of the observations and of the expectations in a regression experiment are the vectors @xmath7 @xmath8 = \\mathbf{e}[(y_1,y_2 ) ] = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta } ) = ( \\eta_1(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}),\\eta_2(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta})),\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a certain unknown parameter vector to be estimated and @xmath10 are known functions .",
    "let us call @xmath11 the margins of each @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 the joint probability density function of the random vector @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unknown copula parameter vector .",
    "according to sklar s theorem ( @xcite ) , let us assume that the dependence between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is modeled by a copula function @xmath19    the fisher information matrix @xmath20 for a single observation is a @xmath21 matrix whose elements are @xmath22 \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",
    "the aim of design theory is to quantify the amount of information on both sets of parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , from the regression experiment embodied in the fisher information matrix .    for a concrete experiment with @xmath26 independent observations at @xmath27 support points @xmath28 ,",
    "the corresponding information matrix @xmath29 then is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are such that : @xmath33 the approximate design theory is concerned with finding @xmath34 such that it maximizes some scalar function @xmath35 , i.e. , the so - called design criterion .    in @xcite , we have developed the theory for the well known criterion of @xmath1-optimality , i.e. , the criterion @xmath36 , if @xmath37 is non - singular . in this work ,",
    "we consider the case when the primary interest is in certain meaningful parameter contrasts .",
    "such contrasts are element of the vector @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an @xmath40 matrix of rank @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath29 is non - singular , then the variance matrix of the least - square estimator of @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath42 and then a natural criterion , generalization of the @xmath1-optimality for this context , would be of maximizing @xmath43^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this criterion is called _ @xmath4-optimality _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following theorem shows a generalization for the @xmath4-optimality of the kiefer - wolfowitz type equivalence theorem already proved in @xcite for @xmath1-optimality .",
    "we have omitted the proof as it is , albeit a little more elaborate , fully analogous .",

    "@xmath45 is @xmath4-optimal ; 2 .   for every @xmath46 ,",

    "although we here extend the theory to the general case of @xmath4-optimality , in the following our interest is in the first @xmath41 parameters , only .",
    "in such a case , @xmath29 can be written as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 minor related to the estimated parameters . therefore , the simplified criterion is to maximize the function @xmath53 , which is called _",

    "in contrast to the binary case , such a result indicates that the @xmath1-optimal design is already quite adequate for discriminating between symmetric and asymmetric models .",
    "in this paper we embed the issue of the choice of the copula in the framework of discrimination design .",
    "we present a new methodology based on the @xmath0-optimality to construct design that discriminate between various dependences . through some examples we highlight the strength of the proposed technique due to the usage of the copula properties .",
    "in particular , the proposed approach allows to check the robustness of the @xmath1-optimal design in the sense of discrimination and to construct more informative designs able to distinguish between classes of dependences .",
    "all the shown results are obtained by the usage of the r package docopulae ( @xcite ) .",
    "although we here compare just few possible dependences , the general construction is much wider .",
    "the r package docopulae allows the interested reader to run designs assuming a broad variety of dependence structures .",
    "it then provides a strong computational tool to the usage of copula models in real applications .",
    "the innovative approach we present in this paper is promising as it breaks new ground in the field of experimental design . in the future , we aim at generalizing other discrimination criteria such as @xmath61optimality and @xmath62optimality to flexible copula models ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , powerful compound criteria might be developed for such models ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the construction of multistage design procedures that allow for discrimination and estimation might be of great interest in special applications such as clinical trial studies ( @xcite ) .",
