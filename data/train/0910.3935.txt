    "dense ( @xmath6 @xmath4 ) and high uv field ( @xmath6 times the standard interstellar radiation field in units of the habing field , written @xmath7 hereafter ) photodissociation regions rule the energy balance , and thus evolution , of some of the most fundamental astrophysical objects such as protoplanetary disks , planetary nebulae and starburst galaxies .",
    "one of the best tools to probe this uv illuminated matter is spectroscopy in the mid - infrared ( 5 - 15 @xmath1 m , hereafter mid - ir ) , because it provides information on both the gas and small dust grain properties ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and very small grains , hereafter pahs and vsgs ) .",
    "ideally , one would like to spatially resolve the emission of these components in order to study their variations as the uv field is attenuated .",
    "unfortunately , such observations are very hard to achieve ( for the moment ) on one hand because large ground - based telescopes , providing arcsecond angular resolution , are restrained in wavelength coverage , while on the other hand , space borne telescopes have diameters that are usually too small to resolve the sources .",
    "because it is the closest ultra compact hii  region at a distance of 850 pc , monoceros r2 ( mon r2 , see @xcite and @xcite ) constitutes one of the rare exceptions where one can resolve the pdr between the hii  region and molecular cloud . in this letter , we present and analyze the mid - ir pah and molecular hydrogen emissions in mon r2 based on spatially resolved _",
    "spectral mapping .",
    "mon r2 was observed using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard _ spitzer _ , in the low resolution mode ( @xmath8 ) as part of the `` spechii '' program ( pi c. joblin ) .",
    "the data were obtained in the spectral mapping mode .",
    "the full spectral cubes of the sl1 and sl2 modules were built using the cubism software @xcite from the basic calibrated files retrieved from the _ spitzer _ archive ( version s19 pipeline ) .",
    "the two cubes were then assembled to provide the full sl cube of 26@xmath936 positions in space and @xmath10 170 points in wavelength , ranging from 5 to 14.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "an overview of our observations is presented in fig.[mfit ] .",
    "the ionized gas in the hii  region , traced by the [ neii ] line at 12.8 @xmath1 m , appears confined in a spherical region , as seen by radio continuum observations @xcite and in higher angular and spectral resolution [ neii ] ground based observations @xcite .",
    "the cometary shape of the hii  region is well seen in our [ neii ] map and peaks at about 0.12 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 in the surroundings of the b1 star irs1 .",
    "the fact that [ neii ] maxium contours do not include the exact position of irs1 is due to the saturation of the irs detectors at this position , implying that the intensity could not be measured , though likely peaking there as shown by @xcite and @xcite . pah emission is present everywhere in the region , but for clarity in fig.[mfit ] we only present the region where it is the brightest in the 11.3 @xmath1 m band ( 1 to 4 @xmath13 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12sr@xmath11 ) forming a filamentary / shell structure that surrounds the hii  region .",
    "the h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(3 ) rotational line at 9.7 @xmath1 m peaks in a filament which lies between the hii  region and the cold and dense molecular gas traced by cs @xmath14=5 - 4 ( fig .",
    "[ mfit ] ) transition .",
    "the intensity of the h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(3 ) line is of the order of 1 - 4 @xmath15 erg s@xmath11 @xmath12 sr@xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(2 ) line at 12.3 @xmath1 m follows a similar spatial distribution . as in the orion bar @xcite",
    ", the spatial distribution of these h@xmath0 lines is not correlated with the pah emission contrary to what is seen in lower uv field pdrs like the horsehead nebula @xcite or the @xmath16-ophiucus filament @xcite . in the following",
    "we investigate the origin of these structures from a physical point of view , using pah emission and modeling the h@xmath0 excitation in the pdr . to simplify the task we select three different zones named pdr1 , pdr2 , and pdr3 as displayed in fig.[mfit ] .",
    "pdr1 was chosen to be representative of the region where the maximum of h@xmath0 emission is found ( pah emission is weaker but present ) .",
    "pdr2 is the transition from the hii  region to the molecular gas . at these two positions",
    "it is well seen that h@xmath0 gas is found further from the star than the pah emission ( see cut in fig.[mfit ] ) .",
    "finally , we positioned pdr3 in a region situated further from irs1 which is a smoother transition from ionized to neutral and molecular gas . for comparison , we also consider the mid - ir spectrum obtained integrating the whole irs cube over the area imaged .",
    "in dense and high - uv pdrs like mon r2 , the excitation of the h@xmath0 pure rotational lines is dominated by inelastic collisions @xcite . to quantitatively",
    "probe the role of density @xmath17 and radiation field @xmath7 on the excitation of the lowest energy rotational levels of h@xmath0 , we use the revised meudon pdr code @xcite , for a large grid of radiation fields and densities above @xmath18 @xmath4 .",
    "since the critical density of the s(3 ) line is @xmath19 @xmath4 @xcite the lowest energy rotational levels are thermalized when @xmath20 @xmath4 . as a consequence the s(3)/s(2 ) line ratio scales with the gas temperature and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the rotational temperature of the associated rotational transition . in high uv high density pdrs , the main mechanism heating the gas is the photo - electric heating by electrons ejected from very small dust grains and pahs .",
    "thus , the photoelectric heating efficiency will depend on the ability to eject electrons from the grain surface ( less efficient as grains become positively charged ) and on the density of electrons in the gas with which charged grains recombine and neutralize . in pdrs ,",
    "low energy electrons are provided by the ionization of carbon atoms , and as essentially all the carbon is ionized , the electron density depends on gas density and carbon abundance .",
    "overall , as the elemental abundace [ c]/[h ] is constant , an increase of the gas density ( thus of electron density ) reduces the grains charge and increases the photoelectric heating efficiency ( i.e. , the gas temperature ) .",
    "this explains the dependence of the s(3)/s(2 ) ratio with density seen in fig.[pdr ] .     and intensity of the radiation field @xmath7 .",

    "this emission model includes the four major dust components , introduced in these previous works : vsgs ( small carbonaceous dust grains ) , free neutral pahs , positively ionized pahs ( pah@xmath25 ) , and finally pah@xmath26 that are large ( with @xmath27 carbon atoms ) charged pahs .",
    "we decompose the observed mid - ir emission using the 4 template spectra presented in @xcite . in addition , we consider continuum emission that is simply modelled with two slopes .",
    "furthermore , we include the effect of extinction by multiplying the mid - ir spectrum by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the extinction cross section per nucleon , taken from @xcite with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the column density on material on the line of sight is left as a free parameter in the fit .",

    "this implies that the observed @xmath24 ratio , after correction for extinction ( table [ table2 ] ) , allows to derive the approximate densities of pdr 1,2,3 in fig.[pdr]-b .",
    "in addition , since these lines are thermalized , the gas temperature , @xmath61 , is coincident with the rotational temperature , @xmath22 , and we can infer @xmath61 for the different pdrs ( table [ table3 ] ) . to calculate the rotational temperature we have assumed an ortho - to - para ratio of 3 , that is the equilibrium value for temperatures larger than 100 k. finally ,",
    "using the value of @xmath66 estimated with the pah ionization fraction ( or @xmath39 ) , and the above derived @xmath61 and @xmath17 we can derive the intensity of the radiation field that illuminates the three pdrs and position precisely pdrs 1,2 and 3 in fig .",
    "the found values for @xmath72 ( table [ table3 ] ) are consistent with mon r2 being a dense and highly uv irradiated pdrs as estimated from other molecular lines @xcite .",
    "the found values for density are lower than in these previous works , because the present tracers ( pahs and h@xmath0 ) probe the outermost cloud regions directly exposed to the uv radiation field that are usually warmer ( @xmath73500 k ) and less dense than regions situated deeper into the molecular cloud ( see cut in fig .",
    "1 ) . finally , the estimated parameters using this technique , for the _ entire _ mon r2 region ( see table 2 ) , are more consistent with the ones derived for spatially resolved pdrs 2 and 3 .",

    "the main results we have presented in this letter are : ( _ i _ ) mon r2 is a unique template of high - uv / high - density pdrs that is spatially resolved , similar to the orion bar ( where the uv field is slightly lower ) , ( _ ii _ ) our observations are consistent with pdr models which predict that in high - uv and dense pdrs , the excitation of pure rotational h@xmath0 lines is collisional and depends on gas temperature , ( _ iii _ ) for this reason , the spatial distributions of pahs and warm h@xmath0 are different , contrary to what is seen in cool pdrs , ( _ iv _ ) however , because pah emission is present in the extended region illuminated by the radiation , their ionization fraction can be used to probe the intensity of the uv radiation field , even where h@xmath0 emission peaks .",
    "thus , the mid - ir spectrum of dense and highly irradiated pdrs appears as an efficient probe of the physical conditions in these environments .",
    "the ratio between the molecular h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(3)/s(2 ) line intensities allows to directly compute the density and temperature of the gas , while the measurement of the ionization fraction of pahs allows to derive the intensity of the radiation field .",
    "we show that the derived parameters for the entire mon r2 region are consistent with those found for the spatially resolved pdrs 2 and 3 .",
    "this is likely because the dense pdr1 occupies only a small part of the whole region , and therefore dilution effects imply that the spatially averaged spectrum is dominated by emission from lower density pdrs .",
    "thus , we suggest that this spectral methodology could be useful to derive the dominant physical conditions in pdrs that are not spatially resolved in the mid - ir . in particular , the pdrs at the surface of protoplanetary disks around herbig ae@xmath74be stars @xcite or in the inner rim of t - tauri disks @xcite are expected to be the targets where such an analysis can be applied . the mid - ir spectrum of starburst galaxies is probably dominated by the emission of pdrs having similar conditions as those described in this paper ( see @xcite for the case of m82 ) .",
    "thus , the present methodology could be a useful tool to derive global properties of galaxies , in connection with massive star formation activity , using forthcoming james webb and spica space telescopes that will observe these emission features at low and high redshifts .",
