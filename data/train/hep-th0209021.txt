    "symmetry has plaid an important role in particle physics@xcite .",
    "all known basic forces of nature , i.e. , gravitational , electromagnetic , weak and strong forces , are governed by the symmetry principles .",
    "three of them ( electromagnetic , weak and strong forces ) have turned out to be characterized by the gauge symmetry @xmath6 . thus the three fundamental gauge interactions among the building blocks or elementary particles ( quarks and leptons ) are mediated via the abelian and non - abelian yang - mills gauge fields@xcite .",
    "the real world of particles has been found to be successfully described by quantum field theories ( qfts ) @xcite . in the meantime , the gauge invariance has been viewed as a basic principle@xcite in addition to the well - known basic principles of lorentz invariance and translational invariance .",
    "qfts have also been applied to deal with effective theories for composite fields and particles at low energies and also critical phenomena ( or phase transitions ) in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , qfts can not be defined by a straightforward perturbative expansion due to the presence of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .",
    "namely , the definition of feynman diagrams in the perturbative expansion may be meaningless because of lack of convergence .",
    "to avoid such difficulties , one may modify the behavior of field theory at very large momentum , or introduce so called regulators ( more general speaking , the regularization quanta ) , so that all feynman diagrams become well - defined finite quantities .",
    "such a procedure is usually called regularization .",
    "the most important features required for the regularization are that the regularization should maintain the basic symmetry principles of the theory , such as gauge invariance , lorentz invariance and translational invariance ( or poincare invariance ) , and also preserve the initial but well - defined divergent properties of the theory .",
    "many regularization methods have been introduced in the literature , such as : cut - off regularization@xcite , pauli - villars regularization@xcite , schwinger s proper time regularization@xcite , bphz regularization@xcite , dimensional regularization@xcite , lattice regularization@xcite , differential regularization@xcite .",
    "all the regularizations have their advantages and shortcomings .",
    "the cut - off regularization is the simplest one by naively setting an upper bound to the integrating loop momentum .",
    "this method is often used to treat qfts in statistical mechanics or in certain low energy dynamical systems , where the divergent behavior of the theory plays the crucial role , and the lorentz or poincare invariance beomes unimportant and the gauge symmetry is not involved at all . in contrast , the method fails in applying to the qfts for elementary particles in which lorentz or poincare invariance and yang - mills gauge invariance play an imporatnt role .",
    "this is because the method destroys the principle of lorentz and translational ( or poincare ) invariance and also the principle of gauge invariance for gauge theories .",
    "the spirit of pauli - villars s regularization is to modify the propagator .",
    "its prescription is simple : replacing any propagator by a sum of propagators with large masses , and choosing appropriate coefficients so that the large momentum behavior becomes well controlled .",
    "more general modifications on the propagators may be introduced in schwinger s proper time regularization .",
    "whereas in pauli - villars s regularization , a set of regulator fields are usually introduced to modify the action of original theory . though pauli - villars s inspired regularizations may preserve a large number of symmetries of the theory , there are still a class of feynman diagrams which can not be regularized by this approach .",
    "such field theories include the non - abelian yang - mills gauge theories@xcite and also the non - linear @xmath7-model . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a higher covariant derivative pauli - villars regularization was proposed for maintaining the gauge symmetry in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that such a regularization violates unitarity@xcite and also leads to an inconsistent quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite .",
    "bphz prescription relies on the theorem proved by weinberg@xcite , which states that the requirement for the actual convergence of the amplitude corresponding to any graph is that the power - counting should give a negative superficial degree of divergence for the complete multiple integral for the whole amplitude and also for any subintegration defined by holding any one or more linear combinations of the loop momenta fixed .",
    "the prescription does eliminate all superficial divergences and render the renormalized feynman integrals to be convergent .",
    "the forest formula provides a powerful tool to construct proofs of renormalizability to all orders .",
    "in fact , the method is a regularization - independent subtraction scheme up to the finite part . to proceed the practical calculation",
    "so as to extract the finite part by means of the forest formula , one still has to adopt a regularization scheme .",
    "as such a subtraction process is based on expanding around an external momentum , which modifies the structure of the feynman integral amplitudes , thus the gauge invariance is potentially destroyed when applying the bphz subtraction scheme to non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "in addition , the unitarity , locality and causality may also not rigorously hold in such a subtraction scheme . in the lattice regularization",
    ", both space and time are made to be the discrete variables .",
    "the method can preserve gauge symmetries of the theory , but the principle of lorentz and translational ( or poincare ) invariance is lost in this method . though there is a great advantage that lattice regularization",
    "may be extended to the nonperturbative calculations by a numerical method , it may also , at the same time , lead to a disadvantage due to a very complicated perturbative calculation .",
    "the principle of dimensional regularization is to define all feynman diagrams by analytic continuation in the space - time dimension parameter , when the space - time dimension is required to be the initial one , the feynman diagrams will recover the initial logarithmically uv divergences but the quadratically uv divergences are suppressed .",
    "this method provides the simplest symmetry principle preserving regularization in the perturbative calculations . whereas it seems to be meaningless beyond perturbative expansion as it involves continuation of feynman diagrams in space - time dimension parameter to arbitrary values .",
    "the method also fails if quantities are specific to the initial space - time dimension , such as @xmath8 in four dimensions and the complete antisymmetric tensor @xmath9 as well as the case that scaling behavior becomes important .",
    "the cases include the chiral , topological and supersymmetric theories .",
    "for that a so - called dimensional reduction regularization was suggested@xcite as a variant of dimensional regularization , in which the continuation from dimension d=4 to d = n is made by compactification .",
    "thus the number of field components remains unchanged and the momentum integrals are n - dimensional .",
    "such a prescription may cause ambiguities in the finite parts of the amplitudes and also in the divergent parts of high order corrections .",
    "the scheme has been applied particularly in supersymmetric models . in general , it seems to hold only at one loop level and is actually inconsistent with analytical continuation concerning @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the dimensional regularization may not be applicable to deal with the dynamics of effective qfts at a physically meaningful finite energy scale .",
    "the well - known example is the derivation of gap equation in the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio model@xcite .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the dimensional regularization can not lead to a correct gap equation .",
    "this is because the dimensional regularization destroys the quadratic ` divergent ' ( or quadratic ` cut - off ' momentum ) term in the gap equation though it maintains gauge invariance . instead , when adopting the simple cut - off regularization to regulate loop integrals , one can arrive at a desired gap equation , but the gauge invariance is destroyed by a quadratically ` divergent ' ( or quadratic ` cut - off ' momentum ) term and also by ambiguities associated with arbitrary routing of loop momentum due to lack of translational invariance .",
    "another example is for the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements of four quark operators in the kaon decays @xmath10 .",
    "if applying the dimensional regularization to the long - distance operator evaluation in the chiral perturbation theory , one arrives at a wrong sign for the leading order contributions when matching to the corresponding short - distance operator evaluation in perturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "the reason is the same as the previous one , the dimensional regularization destroys the leading quadratic cut - off momentum terms which have the same sign as the leading order terms in perturbative qcd .",
    "actually , the quadratic terms in the chiral perturbation theory were found to play a crucial role for understanding the @xmath11 rule and for providing a consistent prediction on the direct cp - violating parameter @xmath12 in kaon decays@xcite . from these two realistic and interesting examples , it is not difficult to further understand the shortcoming of the dimensional regularization . in general , the dimensional regularization suppresses the scaling behavior somehow via a cancellation between uv and ir divergences .",
    "actually , in the dimensional regularization there is no ` divergent ' contribution that can appear in a power of cut - off energy scale .",
    "the differential regularization was proposed as a method working directly on feynman graphs in coordinate space@xcite .",
    "where one substitutes singular expressions by derivatives of well - behaved distributions .",
    "however , in gauge theories , the unsatisfactory feature arises due to the arbitrariness of the different renormalization scales in the ward identities among renormalized green functions .",
    "thus one has to adjust the scales in an appropriate way so as to preserve the gauge invariance .",
    "lately , a so - called constrained differential regularization was introduced@xcite to fix the ambiguities of the local counterterms , so that the gauge invariance can be maintained in a convenient way . while from the calculational viewpoint , one loses the advantage of working directly in the momentum space .    from the above points of view ,",
    "one may arrive at the conclusion that up to now there exists no single satisfactory regularization that can be applied to all purposes in qfts .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether one is able to find a regularization which can combine the advantages appearing in the above mentioned regularizations . to realize this purpose",
    ", the new regularization should match at least four criteria :    \\(i ) the regularization is rigorous that it can maintain the basic symmetry principles in the original theory , such as : gauge invariance , lorentz invariance and translational invariance , except the anomaly induced symmetry breaking and the intrinsic mass scale caused conformal scaling symmetry breaking .",
    "\\(ii ) the regularization is general that it can be applied to both underlying renormalizable qfts ( such as qcd ) and effective qfts ( like the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio model and chiral perturbation theory ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the regularization is also essential in the sense that it can lead to the well - defined feynman diagrams with maintaining the initial but well - defined divergent properties of the theory , so that the regularized theory only needs to make an infinity free ( finite ) or infinity - controlled renormalization .",
    "\\(iv ) the regularization must be simple that it can provide the practical calculations .",
    "+ the first and forth criteria are clearly understood .",
    "the second and third ones are in principle related , for which we may recall the following point of view : it has generally been assumed that the fundamental laws of nature are governed by a quantum theory of fields since the time when the electromagnetic and also the weak and strong interactions were found to be well described by the qfts .",
    "however , this idea has been challenged from the studies of quantum gravity . as it is known that the einstein s theory of general relativity is not a perturbatively renormalizable qft in the power - counting sense . also because of divergent problem in the perturbative expansion of qfts",
    ", one has raised the issue that underlying theory might not be a quantum theory of fields , it could be something else , for example , string or superstring@xcite .",
    "if this could turn out to be the case , even the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and qcd as well the quantum flavor dynamics ( qfd ) of electroweak interactions might be regarded as the effective qfts . in general , effective qfts",
    "are thought to be resulted from low energy approximations of a more fundamental theory .",
    "this may become more clear from the so - called folk theorem by weinberg@xcite .",
    "the theorem states that any quantum theory that at sufficiently low energy and large distances looks lorentz invariant and satisfies the cluster decomposition principle will also at sufficiently low energy look like a quantum field theory .",
    "according to such a folk theorem , there likely exists in any case a characteristic energy scale ( ces ) @xmath0 which can be either a fundamental - like energy scale ( such as the planck scale @xmath13 and/or the string scale @xmath14 in string theory ) or a dynamically generated energy scale ( for instance , the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath15 in chiral perturbation theory and the critical temperature for superconductivity ) , so that any effective qfts become meaningful only at a sufficiently low energy scale in comparison with the ces @xmath0 .    in general , there is no restriction on the ces @xmath0 .",
    "a particularly interesting case is to run the ces @xmath0 going to infinity . if in this case",
    ", the qfts can remain to be well - defined by performing a renormalization , namely one can formally recover the initial divergent properties of qfts in the perturbative expansion at @xmath16 and consistently eliminate all infinities via an appropriate renormalization of coupling constants and fields in the original theory , we may then mention such kinds of qfts as the underlying renormalizable qfts .",
    "it is not difficult to show that qfts in which there are only yang - mills gauge fields interacting with dirac spinor fields can be viewed as underlying renormalizable qfts . while the einstein s theory of general relativity may be regarded as an effective theory at the sufficiently low energy scale in comparison with the ces which is in the order of magnitude of the planck mass , i.e. , @xmath17 .    on the other hand , basing on the idea of renormalization group developed by either wilson@xcite or gell - mann and low@xcite",
    ", one should be able to deal with physical phenomena at any interesting energy scale by integrating out the physics at higher energy scales .",
    "this implies that one can define the renormalized theory at any interesting renormalization scale or the so - called sliding energy scale ( ses ) @xmath1 which is not related to masses of particles or fields and can be chosen to be at any scale of interest , so that the physical effects above the ses @xmath1 are integrated in the renormalized couplings and fields .",
    "with these considerations , it becomes reasonable to conjecture that there should exist an alternative new regularization scheme that can realize the above mentioned attractive properties .",
    "of particular , the regularization for which we are looking must be governed by a physically meaningful ces @xmath0 and also a physically interesting ses @xmath1 , so that the laws of nature can well be described by a quantum theory of fields when the energy scale in the considered phenomena becomes sufficiently lower than the ces @xmath0 , and also the laws of nature at an interesting energy scale can well be dealt with by renormalizing at the ses @xmath1 which can be chosen to be the order of magnitude of the energy concerned in the considered process .",
    "it is this motivation that comes to the purpose of the present paper which may be organized as follows : in section ii , by conceptually defining a set of so - called irreducible loop integrals ( ilis ) , we perform an explicit evaluation for the gauge field vacuum polarization graphs at one - loop order in the non - abelian gauge theory with a general @xmath18 gauge . as a consequence ,",
    "we arrive at two necessary conditions for the regularized quadratically and logarithmically divergent ilis in order to maintain the gauge invariance of non - abelian gauge theories ( or to satisfy the so - called generalized ward identities ) . in analogous to the quantum electrodynamics , the gauge fixing term @xmath19 is found to be unaffected by the loop graphs . while it is unlike the usual case ( such as the case in the dimensional regularization )",
    ", the tadpole graphs of gauge fields are found in the most general case to play an important role for maintaining manifest gauge invariance . at the end of section",
    ", we present a set of consistency conditions which ensures the gauge invariance for all one loop graphs .",
    "we then explore in section iii a new regularization method which satisfies the consistency conditions presented in section ii for the regularized divergent ilis . to be more clear , we begin with an explicit check on the two consistency conditions in the well - known cut - off regularization and dimensional regularization methods .",
    "it is then easily seen why the cut - off regularization destroys the gauge invariance and the dimensional regularization does maintain the gauge invariance .",
    "we then present an alternative new regularization method to achieve the desired four criteria mentioned above .",
    "it is shown in section iv that the regulators ( or regularization quanta ) are indeed decouple from the regularized ilis . consequently ,",
    "we arrive at , through a numerical check , three conjectures on mathematically interesting numbers and functional limits .",
    "we then arrive at a consistent regularization scheme . in section",
    "v , we study in details the overlapping feynmay integrals involved in the general two loop graphs and present an explicit evaluation for the corresponding ilis by adopting the usual feynman parameter method and a newly formulated uv - divergence preserving parameter method .",
    "the latter method ensures that all the feynman parameter integrations contain no uv divergences .",
    "the explicit forms and remarkable features of the ilis enable us to deduce a set of key theorems which contain the factorization theorem and subtraction theorem for overlapping divergences , and the reduction theorem for overlapping tensor type integrals as well as the relation theorem for the tensor and scalar type ilis . in section",
    "vi , we present a general prescription for the new regularization and renormalization method . in particular , an explicit demonstration is provided for two loop diagrams .",
    "the overlapping divergences are shown to be harmless after an appropriate subtraction .",
    "the subtraction process can be made to be analogous to the one in the dimensional regularization .",
    "all the feynman parameter integrations are convergent .",
    "the scheme is seen to respects unitarity and causality .",
    "we show in section vii how to evaluate the ilis of arbitrary loop graphs . after a detailed evaluation for the ilis of three loop graphs , a general procedure for the evaluation of any fold ilis",
    "is presented , which should be practically useful to make a realistic computation for arbitrary loop diagrams . in section viii",
    ", we pay our special attention to the issues on the conformal scaling symmetry breaking , the mass gap genesis in yang - mills gauge theories and the quark confinement and deconfinement .",
    "our conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "some useful formulae and technical details concerned in the text are presented in appendices .",
    "we start from the lagrangian of gauge theory with dirac spinor fields @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) interacting with yang - mill gauge field @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 with @xmath25 here @xmath26 are the generators of gauge group and @xmath27 the structure function of the gauge group with @xmath28 = i f_{abc } t^c $ ] . to quantize the gauge theory ,",
    "it is necessary to fix the gauge by adding the gauge fixing term and introducing the corresponding faddeev - popov ghost term@xcite with the ghost fields @xmath29 . in the covariant gauge ,",
    "the additional lagrangian @xmath30 has been found to take the following form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "thus the modified lagrangian is given by @xmath33 based on this modified lagrangian , one can derive the feynman rules@xcite for propagators and vertex interactions@xcite .    for simplicity , we begin with our considerations at one - loop level . to find out the gauge symmetry preserving conditions , it is of help to introduce a set of loop integrals which consist of the scalar type ones @xmath34 and tensor type ones @xmath35 where the number ( @xmath36 ) in the subscript labels the power counting dimension of energy momentum in the integrals . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are corresponding to the quadratically divergent integrals ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and the logarithmically divergent integrals ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "we will explicitly see below that all one - loop feynman integrals of vacuum polarization feynman diagrams can be expressed in terms of the above set of integrals by adopting the usual feynman parameter method . in general , all feynamn integrals from the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) graphs can be evaluated into the above simple one - fold integrals .",
    "note that the mass factor @xmath43 is regarded as an effective one which depends on the feynman parameters and the external momenta @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 .    to be conceptually helpful ,",
    "we may mention the above set of loop integrals as the one - fold irreducible loop integrals ( ilis ) which are evaluated from one loop feynman diagrams . in general , n - fold ilis",
    "are evaluated from n - loop overlapping feynman integrals of loop momenta @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and are generally defined as the loop integrals in which there are no longer the overlapping factors @xmath48 @xmath49 which appear in the original overlapping feynman integrals .",
    "it will be shown that any loop integrals can be evaluated into the corresponding ilis by repeatedly using the feynman parameter method ( see appendix a ) and a newly formulated uv - divergence preserving parameter method ( see eq .",
    "( 5.6 ) ) .",
    "we now evaluate the vacuum polarization diagrams of gauge fields to one - loop order .",
    "there are in general four non - vanishing one - loop diagrams ( see figures ( 1)-(4 ) ) .",
    "their contributions to the vacuum polarization function are denoted by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) respectively .",
    "the first three diagrams arise from the pure yang - mills gauge theory , their contributions to the vacuum polarization function may be labeled as @xmath52 .",
    "the last diagram is from the fermionic loop and its contribution to the vacuum polarization function is denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "the total contributions to the gauge field vacuum polarization function are then given by summing over all the four diagrams @xmath54 gauge invariance requires that @xmath55 which should be true for any non - abelian gauge group and valid for arbitrary fermion number @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates that both parts @xmath57 and @xmath58 should satisfy the generalized ward identities @xmath59    in terms of the one - fold ilis , the vacuum polarization function @xmath57 from fermionic loop is simply given by ( for more details see appendix a ) @xmath60      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that the gauge invariance is spoiled only by the quadratic divergent ilis .",
    "it then implies that the regularization for which we are looking should lead to the following general condition @xmath61 so that the gauge non - invariant terms caused by the quadratically divergent ilis cancel each other and the vacuum polarization function @xmath57 satisfies the generalized ward identity and maintains the gauge invariance . here",
    "the integrals with superscript @xmath62 means the regularized ilis .",
    "obviously , under this condition the regularized vacuum polarization function @xmath63 from fermionic loop becomes gauge invariant and takes a simple form @xmath64    the gauge field vacuum polarization function @xmath58 in the pure yang - mills gauge theory is much complicated as it receives contributions from three diagrams ( for a more detailed evaluation see appendix a ) . summing over the contributions from the three diagrams and making some algebra , we then obtain @xmath65 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & [ \\ \\left(5/2 - 2x(1-x ) -3(1-x)(1 - 2x ) \\",

    "second , any consistent regularization must satisfy the necessary conditions resulted from the generalized ward identities ( or gauge invariant conditions ) @xmath89 .",
    "it also becomes clear that under the two necessary conditions the gauge fixing term @xmath19 in non - abelian gauge theories is not affected by the loop graphs , which arrives at the same conclusion as the one in abelian gauge theory .",
    "third , the quadratically divergent terms may not necessarily be a harmful source for the gauge invariance once a rigorous regularization can be found to satisfy the necessary conditions for the regularized quadratically divergent ilis , so that all the regularized quadratically divergent ilis cancel each other .",
    "last but not least , in contrast to the usual case in the dimensional regularization , in the most general case , the tadpole graphs of yang - mills gauge fields actually play an essential role for maintaining the gauge invariance , which can explicitly be seen from the above general evaluation on the vacuum polarization function .",
    "in fact , it is the tadpole graph that leads to the manifest gauge invariant form of the vacuum polarization function even without carrying out any explicit integrations over the feynman parameter @xmath66 and the loop momentum @xmath90 .",
    "here we have only presented the explicit evaluation for the vacuum polarization function of gauge bosons . for all other two - point , three - point and four - point one loop feynman graphs of fermions , gauge and ghost bosons arising from the gauge theory described by the lagrangian eqs.(2.1 - 2.5 )",
    ", it can be shown that they all maintain the gauge invariance and satisfy the generalized ward identities at one - loop level as long as the following conditions for the regularized ilis hold @xmath91 for quadratically divergent ilis , and @xmath92 for logarithmically divergent ilis , as well as @xmath93 for convergent ilis .",
    "where we have used the notation @xmath94    we may mention the above conditions as the general regularization - independent _ consistency conditions _ for maintaining the gauge invariance of theories .",
    "it is easily shown that the dimensional regularization does satisfy the above consistency conditions .",
    "it is of interest to see that once the above consistency conditions for the regularized ilis hold , the divergent structure of the theories can be well characterized by only two regularized scalar type ilis @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "in general , one may not need to evaluate those ilis by any specific regularization scheme . as it has been turned out that in the underlying gauge theories the quadratic divergences arising from the vacuum polarization functions cancel each other , while the logarithmic divergences can be fully absorbed into the redefinitions of the coupling constants and the relevant fields . in this sense ,",
    "one arrives at a regulator free scheme for the underlying theories .",
    "mathematically , one only needs to prove that such a regularization exists and can result in the above consistency conditions among the ilis .",
    "practically , we shall explicitly show in the following sections that there does exist , in addition to the dimensional regularization , an alternative regularization scheme that can lead to the above consistency conditions and in the meantime match to the four criteria stated in the introduction .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to point out that the above consistency conditions hold exactly without any ambiguities , which differs from the so - called consistency relations imposed in the implicit regularization@xcite .",
    "where some local arbitrary counterterms parameterized by ( finite ) differences of divergent integrals arise , they may ( or not ) be determined by the physical conditions .",
    "the reason is that the consistency relations in the implicit regularization are imposed among the basic divergent integrals which are independent of the external momenta .",
    "namely the mass factor in those basic divergent integrals remains the original mass of fields .",
    "this is explicitly seen from the following identity and truncation which have been used in the implicit regularization    @xmath97 } = \\sum_{j=0}^{n }         \\frac{(-1)^j ( p_i^2 + 2p_i \\cdot k ) ^j}{(k^2 -m^2)^{j+1 } }          +   \\frac{(-1)^{n+1 } ( p_i^2 + 2p_i \\cdot k ) ^{n+1}}{(k^2 -m^2)^{n+1 } [ ( k+p_i)^2 -m^2 ] } \\ ] ]    where @xmath44 are the external momenta and @xmath98 is chosen so that the last term is finite under integration over @xmath90 .",
    "it must be this truncation that causes the local arbitrary counterterms .",
    "we now proceed to explore a possible new regularization which can preserve the basic symmetry principles of the theory and lead to an infinity free renormalization . before doing so",
    ", it is helpful to briefly look at the well - known two simple regaularizations , i.e. , cut - off regularization and dimensional regularization , through checking the consistency conditions resulted from the generalized ward identities ( or gauge invariant conditions ) .    the regularized ilis in the cut - off regularization are presented in appendix b. from the explicit forms overthere , one easily sees that @xmath99             \\neq \\frac{1}{2 } g_{\\mu\\nu } i_2^r |_{cutoff}\\ ,     \\\\    i_{0\\ \\mu\\nu}^r |_{cutoff }        & = &   \\frac{1}{4}g_{\\mu\\nu}\\ i_0   |_{cutoff } +    \\frac{i}{64\\pi^2}g_{\\mu\\nu }       \\left ( \\frac{{\\cal m}^2}{\\lambda^2 + { \\cal m}^2 }       - \\frac{{\\cal m}^4}{2(\\lambda^2 + { \\cal m}^2)^2 }   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\right )       \\neq \\frac{1}{4 } g_{\\mu\\nu } i_0^r |_{cutoff }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the cut - off momentum .",
    "obviously , the regularized ilis by the simple cut - off regularization do not satisfy the consistency conditions .",
    "in fact , not only the quadratically divergent terms can destroy the gauge invariance , even the finite terms may spoil the gauge conditions in the simple cut - off regularization .",
    "whereas one may notice that the involved logarithmically divergent terms in the regularized ilis do satisfy the consistency conditions .",
    "this is actually the case realized by the dimensional regularization . from the explicit results given in appendix b for the regularized ilis in the dimensional regularization , it is not difficult to yield , by using the identity @xmath101 , the desired relations @xmath102",
    "it then becomes manifest why the dimensional regularization preserves gauge symmetry .    to see the difference between the cut - off regularization and dimensional regularization",

    "this may become more clear from the vanishing integral in the dimensional regularization @xmath110 it is this property that suppresses the quadratic divergence in the dimensional regularization .",
    "actually , the dimensional regularization destroys all the divergences in a power of cut - off momentum because of the vanishing integrals @xmath111 which implies that divergences appearing in any loop integrals are expressed only in terms of the expansion by powers of @xmath108 in the dimensional regularization .",
    "we now turn to investigate the possible new regularization .",
    "it has been seen from the previous section that the divergences actually arise from loop integrals .",
    "it is the uv divergent loop integrals which destroy the generalized ward identities of gauge invariance .",
    "this observation naturally motivates us to propose a new regularization scheme which is supposed to regularize the ilis of loop graphs , i.e. , the whole feynman diagrams , instead of only the propagators carrying out in the pauli - villars inspired methods . unlike the pauli - villars regularization , we are not going to introduce any regulator fields to modify the action of original theory .",
    "alternative to the dimensional regularization , we shall not change the space - time dimension of initial theories .",
    "our motivation is only to modify the very high energy behavior of loop integrals and/or the very low energy behavior of loop integrals if the integrals concern ir divergent .",
    "in fact , we do not well understand the physics at very short distances , especially the physics above the planck scale .",
    "thus it must not be surprised that at infinitely large loop momentum , the feynman diagrams and the corresponding feynman integrals become ill - defined due to the lack of convergence .",
    "they are actually meaningless because of the uv divergent integrals which destroy the basic gauge symmetry principle in gauge theories .",
    "moreover , it is also a hard task in certain qfts to deal with the physics at a very low energy scale when the nonperturbative effects of strong interactions become important at that scale . in particular , the same serious problem may be faced when the feynman integrals also become ill - defined at zero momentum due to the existence of ir divergences .",
    "all of these considerations strongly suggest the necessity of regularization for qfts .    here",
    "we are going to present a new regularization without introducing any additional lagrangian formulation to modify the original theory as usually done in the pauli - villars inspried regularization .",
    "what we are doing is only to require the new regularization possessing the most important and necessary properties , namely : the regularization shall make the meaningless divergent ilis to be well - defined and physically meaningful , and also to be applicable to both underlying ( renormalizable ) qfts and effective qfts .",
    "furthermore the new regularization shall preserve the initial divergent behavior and meanwhile maintain the important symmetry principles in the original theory .",
    "more specifically we are going to work out the regularization which will ensure the regularized divergent ilis satisfying the consistency conditions of gauge invariance even when keeping the quadratic ` cut - off ' terms in the loop integrals .",

    ", we shall finally verify that the physical quantities are independent of any regulators ( or regularization quanta ) introduced in the regularization scheme , namely the regulators ( or regularization quanta ) will eventually be decouple from the well - defined regularized theory .",

    "are given by the polynomial of @xmath165 rather than the one of @xmath166 in the dimensional regularization .",
    "of particular , in the new regularization , one can always make on mass - shell renormalization even for a massless theory , like qcd with massless quarks .",
    "this is because one can always choose the ses @xmath1 to be at an interesting finite energy scale .",
    "nevertheless , the new regularization is formally compatible with the dimensional regularization as they satisfy the same consistency conditions .",
    "finally , we want to point out that the prescription of the new regularization formally appears to be similar to the one of pauli - villars , but they are different in the following two aspects : first , the new regularization is applied to the ilis of feynman loop graphs rather than the propagators imposed in the pauli - villars regularization which manifestly spoils gauge invariance .",
    "this is a conceptual extension to the pauli - villars regularization .",
    "second , in the new regularization , the coefficients @xmath123 ( @xmath167 ) are well determined and independent of the regulator mass factors @xmath117 for @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) . here the basic regulator mass scale @xmath170 and the number @xmath98 of regulators are taken to be infinitely large in the new regularization , which is basically a crucial generalization to the usual pauli - villars regularization in which the regulator mass scale @xmath170 is given @xmath171 and the number of regulators is normally chosen to be only a few limited one , say @xmath172 . as we will show below that for a finite @xmath98 and given @xmath170 , the integrals are regulator dependent ( one can explicitly see from table 1 in appendix c ) . only when taking the number @xmath98 and the mass scale @xmath170 of the regulators to be infinite ( or sufficiently large ) , then the resulting regularized theory becomes independent of ( or insensitive to ) the regulators",
    "one may notice that the basic mass scale @xmath140 of the regulators ( or regularization quanta ) does not appear in the final expressions of the regularized ilis , while it is intrinsically correlated to the regulator number @xmath98 in such a way that : taking @xmath140 and @xmath98 to be infinite , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , but keeping the ces @xmath0 remain held fixed .",
    "this implies that @xmath140 must approach to infinity in terms of an appropriate function of @xmath98 . to obtain its explicit form ,",
    "we begin with the conjecture that @xmath175 here @xmath176 is supposed to be a constant mass scale . substituting this form into the definition of the ces @xmath0 ,",
    "we arrive at the relation @xmath177 with @xmath178 being given by @xmath179 here the function @xmath180 is purely determined by the regulator number @xmath98 and supposed to have a finite limit at @xmath181 .",
    "so far the regularized ilis are completely characterized by the three type of functional quantities @xmath180 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , they are solely determined by the regulator number @xmath98 .",
    "it then becomes clear that in order to prove the regularized ilis to be independent of the regulators ( or regularization quanta ) , one actually only needs to show that the regularized ilis are not sensitive to the regulator number @xmath98 at sufficiently large @xmath98 .",
    "this is then equivalent to check whether the functional quantities @xmath180 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 approach to certain finite limits at @xmath174 , namely whether @xmath178 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are eventually reached to the constant numbers . to be manifest ,",
    "we perform , instead of an analytic proof , a numerical evaluation .",
    "the numerical analysis is presented in appendix c .",
    "the numerical results given in table 1 of appendix c truly show that for a sufficiently large @xmath98 the functions @xmath180 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 do approach to certain values which become less sensitive to the changes of the number @xmath98 once @xmath98 is going to be sufficiently large .",
    "in general , we are led to the following three conjectures which have been checked by an appropriate functional fitting method up to the precision of @xmath185 ( for more details , see appendix c ) . + conjecture 1 .",
    "@xmath186 which implies the following interesting functional limit @xmath187    conjecture 2 .",

    "it then implies another interesting functional limit @xmath190    conjecture 3 .",
    "@xmath191 which indicate the functional limits @xmath192    when the above conjectures hold , the functions @xmath193 defined in the previous section via the polynomials can now be expressed by the following simple functions @xmath194    it is then clear that the regulators ( or regularization quanta ) are indeed decouple from the regularized ilis .",
    "furthermore , the consistency conditions eqs.(2.27 - 2.33 ) do hold in the new regularization ( one can easily check that by using the useful integrals given in appendix d ) . therefore it can be concluded that we do arrive at a consistent description for the new regularization scheme .",
    "obviously , an analytical proof for the above conjectures must be very helpful and important .",
    "it may also provide deep insights in mathematics .",
    "the gauge symmetry preserving and infinity free regularization described above is well applied to regularize one loop graphs and the relevant ilis . in order to obtain a consistently regularized theory , such a regularization should be applicable to all loop graphs . furthermore , though the regularized loop graphs become well - defined and infinity free , the coupling constants and the fields in the quantum theories still need to be renormalized .",
    "the only difference is that the subtraction terms become finite quantities instead of infinite ones .",
    "the procedure of such subtractions ( or the so - called renormalization ) must be consistently carried out order by order in perturbative expansion .",
    "in fact , whether the subtraction terms in the renormalization are finite or infinite , in a given order any new subtraction terms must be finite polynomials in external momenta in order to maintain unitarity of the theory .",
    "such a statement should in general be independent of any regularization .",
    "therefore , one shall be able to prove this statement in a more general way without involving any regularization .    to be specific and also for an explicit demonstration , we will treat in this section the feynman integrals involved in two loop diagrams .",
    "the generalization to more loop graphs is straightforward .",
    "it is different from one loop graphs , two loop diagrams require us to make a careful treatment for overlapping divergences .",
    "eventually , we must show that after appropriate subtractions of one loop divergences , the coefficient functions of all the divergent terms are finite polynomials in the external momenta .",
    "namely one has to prove the theorem that all eventual divergences must be harmless divergences .",
    "to arrive at this purpose , we shall first prove that overlapping divergences can completely be factorized .",
    "more specifically we shall show that the overall divergences of two loop graphs and the sub - integral divergences corresponding to one loop graphs can be well separated .",
    "it will be seen below that all of these properties will become manifest after performing the evaluation of two - fold ilis involved in two loop diagrams .",
    "the explicit demonstration in the previous section shows that all divergences in one loop diagrams are harmless ones .",
    "in fact , as all one loop integrals can be expressed in terms of the one - fold ilis by using the feynman parameter method , therefore the divergences are completely characterized by the one - fold ilis .",
    "as the coefficient functions of all divergent one - fold ilis are finite polynomials of external momenta and masses , therefore all the divergences at one loop level are truly harmless ones .",
    "we now come to study two loop graphs .",
    "consider first the scalar type overlapping feynman integrals involved in the general two loop diagrams ( i.e. , the so - called general @xmath195 diagrams @xcite ) @xmath196 the above integral has been given in the euclidean space of momentum through an analytic wick rotation . here",

    "note that the sub - integral over @xmath199 is quadratic and its integration is easily performed .",
    "one first makes momentum shift again for the momentum involved in the second denominator , i.e. , @xmath203 , so that the integral over @xmath203 becomes purely quadratic . factoring out the coefficient of the momentum @xmath245 , one arrives at the integral which contains uv - divergence preserving momentum - like sub - integral over @xmath264 instead of the one over the loop momentum @xmath199 , and the remaining integral has the same form as the one resulting from the first step ( 1 ) but with the reduced integrals over the loop momenta @xmath203 , @xmath403 , @xmath226 .",
    "( 4 ) . repeating the steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) to the remaining loop momentum integrals over @xmath203 , @xmath403 , @xmath226 , but keeping the integral over the last loop momentum ,",
    "we then arrive at the desired ilis . in general , for n - loop overlapping integrals , the resulting ilis are the n - fold ones with ( n-1 ) sub - integrals over the momentum - like variables and one sub - integral over the loop momentum ( say @xmath405 ) .    according to this procedure and prescription ,",
    "the resulting ilis for any loop graphs possess all the properties observed in the ilis of two loop graphs ( see section v ) . in here for the ilis of more loop graphs , one only needs to notice the essential property that all the sub - integrals over the momentum - like variables @xmath264 , @xmath402 , @xmath226 characterize the divergences of one - loop , two - loop , @xmath226 sub - diagrams , respectively , and the single sub - integral over the initial loop momentum characterizes the overall divergences of the loop graph .",
    "one can check that this procedure also ensures that all the uv divergences are characterized by the integrals over the momentum - like variables @xmath264 , @xmath402 , @xmath226 , the usual feynman parameter integrations contain no uv divergences and only ir divergences could be hidden in the feynman parameter integrations . for the regularized ilis in the new regularization scheme ,",
    "all the feynman parameter integrations become convergent . it is then obvious that all the theorems deduced in section v and the prescriptions for the regularization and renormalization described in section vi hold for ilis of arbitrary loop graphs .",
    "it is of interest to observe that feynman integrals of arbitrary loop graphs can always be evaluated into the corresponding ilis which contains only a single one - fold ili over the initial loop momentum which characterizes the overall divergences of the loop graph .",
    "similarly , one can show that the subtracting the divergences from all the sub - integrals over the momentum - like variables @xmath264 ,",
    "@xmath402 , @xmath226 , the overall divergence becomes harmless .",
    "it is particularly noted that the new regularization method may cause the conformal scaling symmetry to be broken down due to the existence of two intrinsic mass scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , because of the quadratic ` cut - off ' terms of the ces @xmath0 , the conformal scaling symmetry can be broken down in a class of theories with scalar interactions .",
    "in general , as long as taking the ses @xmath1 to be finite ( @xmath406 ) , the conformal scaling symmetry will be broken down even in gauge theories .",
    "of particular , once a mass gap @xmath142 is generated via dynamical reasons of strong interactions , it becomes natural to set the ses @xmath1 to be at the mass gap @xmath142 .",
    "an interesting example is for qcd in which an energy scale around @xmath407 gev has often be introduced to characterize the low energy dynamics of qcd .",
    "this is because when the ses @xmath1 runs down to such a low energy scale , @xmath408 gev , the interactions become much stronger .",
    "this feature may easily be understood from the behavior of asymptotic freedom of qcd@xcite . by evaluating the relevant one loop feynman diagrams , it is not difficult to check that the renormalized gauge coupling constant @xmath409 from the new regularization method is consistent with the one from the dimensional regularization at @xmath410 and @xmath411 @xmath412       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where only the polynomial of the finite terms @xmath413 differ from the one in the dimensional regularization . in obtaining the above result , the masses of quarks have been ignored .    on the other hand , for a finite ses",
    "@xmath1 , the conformal scaling symmetry is explicitly broken down due to higher dimensional effective interaction terms , i.e. , their momentum power counting dimensions are larger than four",
    ". in general , the uv convergent but ir divergent feynman diagrams will result in such higher dimensional interaction terms . from the dimensional analysis",
    ", these higher dimensional interactions can be written down in terms of the expansion of the inverse power of the ses @xmath1 @xmath414 which implies that the existence of a non - trivial solution for the ses @xmath1 is transmuted to the one of nonzero vacuum expectation values of @xmath415 and @xmath416 .",
    "indeed , it has been turned out that at a low energy scale @xmath417 gev ( @xmath418 is the charm quark mass ) , the light quarks and gluons were found to have nonzero condensates @xcite due to strong interactions @xmath419 which implies that both conformal scaling symmetry and chiral symmetry are dynamically broken down at such a low energy scale .",
    "this strongly indicates that a mass gap with @xmath420 must be generated and the quarks are going to be confined around such a low energy scale .",
    "obviously , the conformal symmetry breaking scale or the mass gap @xmath421 must be related to the dynamically chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath15 which has been known to be around @xmath422 gev .",
    "the order of magnitude for the mass gap @xmath423 may be estimated from the quark and gluon condensates . from simple dimensional and large @xmath424 considerations , we have @xmath425 which holds in the large @xmath424 limit with @xmath426 being held fixed .",
    "as expected , the mass gap @xmath423 and the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath15 are at the same order of magnitude , namely : @xmath427 correspondingly , the critical temperature for the quark deconfinement is estimated to be at the order of magnitude @xmath428    note that to obtain more definitive results , a detailed quantitative calculation is needed . only the perturbative evaluation of qcd is not enough to determine the numerical value for the mass gap .",
    "it is necessary to develop low energy dynamics of qcd for a nonperturbation evaluation of qcd .",
    "one may construct some effective perturbation theories to describe the low energy qcd .",
    "the crucial issue concerns a consistent matching between the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd . in general , the ir cut - off in the perturbative qcd is related to the uv cut - off in the nonperturbative qcd . as a good example , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the uv cut - off in the chiral perturbation theory of mesons does match to the ir cut - off in perturbative qcd via some appropriate matching conditions .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to further investigate the ir and uv correspondence / matching of the short and long distance dynamics of qcd . as the new regularization is applicable to both underlying perturbative qcd and effective qfts characterizing nonperturbative qcd at low energy , it may provide us a practical tool to understand well the genesis of mass gap and the quark confinement via the ir and uv correspondence / matching of the short and long distance dynamics of qcd .",
    "we have explicitly presented a proof for the existence of a symmetry principle preserving and infinity free regularization and renormalization method .",
    "the main point for the new method is to regularize the whole feynman integrals of loop graphs rather than just the propagators of fields .",
    "the other important point is to analyze an infinitely large number of regulators ( or regularization quanta ) rather than only a limited few regulators .",
    "specifically , the concepts of irreducible loop integrals ( ilis ) and uv - divergence preserving parameter method as well as intrinsic mass scales ( i.e. , the characteristic energy scale ( ces ) @xmath0 and the sliding energy scale ( ses ) @xmath1 ) have been found to play an essential role .",
    "consequently , the regularized qfts become well defined .",
    "the method has been developed to be practically applicable to both underlying renormalizable qfts and effective qfts .",
    "indeed , it provides an explicit demonstration that a quantum theory of fields can be applied to describe the laws of nature only when the considered energy scale is sufficiently lower than the ces @xmath0 .",
    "thus the underlying renormalizable qfts , like yang - mills gauge theories , become particularly interesting as the ces @xmath0 in such theories is in principle allowed to be infinitely large @xmath411 through a suitable renormalization for the gauge coupling and fields , which is equivalent to the dimensional regularization with @xmath162 .    in general , the scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 at a particularly interesting energy scale @xmath142 actually set the uv and ir cut - off energy scales respectively in the regularized qfts , but they distinguish from the naive cutoff momentum scales imposed kinematically to the upper and lower bounds of the internal loop momenta , the ces @xmath0 and the ses @xmath1 are more likely to behave as the dynamical mass scales , which remains to be understood from a deeper reason .",
    "it is intriguing to see that the new regularization method provides a consistent way alternative to string theories for making qfts to be well defined finite theories .",
    "though the explicit demonstration for it has been carried out only at one and two loop level , its proof to more loops has been shown to be a straightforward generalization . in this sense , the divergence problem of qfts may no longer be a strong reason for extending the underlying theory to go beyond the quantum theory of fields /elementary particles .",
    "first of all , it must be very helpful to further study the possible interesting phenomena caused by the conformal scaling symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular , the ir and uv correspondence between the short distance physics and long distance physics may play an important role to explore the nonperturbative effects and to understand well the matching between the short and long distance physics .",
    "we believe that the conformal scaling symmetry and its breaking mechanism may eventually guide us to reveal some longstanding puzzles , such as : genesis of mass gap , unseen quarks , missing symmetries , origin of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , and also small but nonzero cosmological constant . finally , we hope that the new method described in this paper can widen the applications of qfts",
