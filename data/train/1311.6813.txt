    "however , correlations including the integrated terms can become important in most cases , but in particular in the case of large redshift separations between the two galaxies of the pair .",
    "especially important is the lensing contribution for near - radial correlations which dominates the local - local contribution . in the near - radial cases ,",
    "the dominant term is the lensing - density one , where the redshift @xmath86 of galaxy 1 increases to high values . in some cases",
    ", the time delay - local correlation can give a significant contribution to the observed correlation .",
    "this happens because , while the local term is dominant for relatively small separations , its magnitude drops dramatically for very large separations , while the other terms do not fall off .",
    "when the first galaxy is at high - redshift , the integrals along the line of sight grow and become the dominant terms .",
    "moreover , in the case of very small angular separation , the magnifying effect of the second galaxy is more evident , and also the lensing auto - correlation becomes very important , making the local part negligible .    finally , we investigated how the magnification bias parameter @xmath15 affects the observed correlation . when @xmath123 , as in the case for 21 cm intensity mapping surveys , lensing effects vanish and relativistic time - delay effects almost disappear . on the other hand , surveys observing sources with a steep luminosity function will observe correlations that include larger effects from integrated terms .",
    "our results show that analyses of large - scale galaxy clustering with wide and , more important , deep surveys , will need to take into account the effects of integrated correlations as they become dominant in the ( near-)radial case",
    ". we will present a new analysis focused on the near - radial correlations and their significance in a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "future surveys such as pfs , desi , euclid , wfirst and the ska will probe extremely large cosmological volumes , and aim to measure cosmological parameters with very high - precision , so there is a need to have precise theoretical modeling .",
    "moreover , large - scale contributions contain additional information on the model of dark energy or modified gravity , so it will be fundamental to account for all the effects to correctly model and probe the density field , and use all the constraining power available .",
    "it is necessary to further investigate details of how these large - scale correlations depend on cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> galaxy clustering on very large scales can be probed via the 2-point correlation function in the general case of wide and deep separations , including all the lightcone and relativistic effects . using our recently developed formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the behavior of the local and integrated contributions for a baseline future survey and how these depend on redshift range , linear and angular separations and luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic corrections to the local part of the correlation can be non - negligible but they remain generally sub - dominant . on the other hand , the additional correlations arising from lensing convergence and time - delay effects can become very important and even dominate the observed total correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate different configurations formed by the observer and the pair of galaxies , and we find that the case of near - radial large - scale separations is where these effects will be the most important . </S>"
