    "this paper is the third in a series presenting high - redshift ( @xmath14 ) quasars selected from the commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) . in papers",
    "i and ii ( fan et al .",
    "1999a , 2000a ) in this series , and in schneider et al .",
    "( 2000a ,  b , 2001 ) , we have presented the discovery of @xmath15 quasars at @xmath16 , selected from @xmath17 deg@xmath5 of sdss multicolor imaging data along the celestial equator . in this paper , we describe observations of additional quasar candidates selected in a similar manner in the fall equatorial stripe , overlapping the areas covered by @xcite and @xcite , together defining a complete color - selected sample of bright high - redshift quasars covering 182 deg@xmath5 . in addition , we search for fainter high - redshift quasars based on areas of the sky that have been imaged twice by the sdss .    in  2 , we describe the photometric observations and quasar candidate selection . in  3 , we present the photometry and the spectroscopic observations of 14 newly discovered quasars in the fall equatorial stripe at @xmath16 and @xmath4 , plus the observations of two previously known quasars in the same area of the sky . in this section ,",
    "we also develop a method of using the measurements of emission line equivalent widths and broad - band multicolor photometry to estimate the slope of the intrinsic power - law continuum . in  4 , we present the final flux - limited color - selected high - redshift quasar sample , which consists of 39 quasars at @xmath4 and @xmath3 and covering 182 deg@xmath5 .",
    "the selection completeness of this sample is calculated in  5 , based on a monte - carlo simulation of quasar colors as a function of redshift , using the quasar spectral model of @xcite .",
    "the effects of redshift , luminosity , continuum shape and emission line strength on the completeness of the survey are discussed in detail in  5 .",
    "the results are summarized in  6 .",
    "this color - selected sample is used to study the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at high redshift in a subsequent paper ( paper iv , @xcite ) .    in appendix",
    "a , we provide updated information on the sdss filter response functions , which are used to calculate quasar model colors and the selection function .",
    "part of the fall equatorial stripe area has been imaged multiple times during the commissioning phase , allowing a search for quasars fainter than @xmath18 . in appendix b , we present the photometry and spectroscopy of 18 faint quasars discovered from these data .",
    "they do not yet form a complete sample with well - defined selection criteria .",
    "the sdss telescope ( @xcite ) , imaging camera ( @xcite ) , and photometric data reduction ( @xcite ) are described in york et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see also paper i ) .",
    "briefly , the telescope , located at apache point observatory in southeastern new mexico , has a 2.5 m primary mirror and a wide , essentially distortion - free field .",
    "the imaging camera contains thirty @xmath19 photometric ccds , which simultaneously observe 6 parallel @xmath20 wide swaths , or _",
    "scanlines _ of the sky , in 5 broad filters ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) covering the entire optical band from the atmospheric cutoff in the blue to the silicon sensitivity cutoff in the red ( @xcite , see also appendix a ) .",
    "the photometric data are taken in time - delay and integrate ( tdi , or `` drift - scan '' ) mode at sidereal rate ; a given point on the sky passes through each of the five filters in succession .",
    "the total integration time per filter is 54.1 seconds .",
    "the data were calibrated photometrically by observing secondary standards in the survey area using a 50 cm telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "the sdss primary standard star network had not yet been finalized at the time of these observations , so the photometric calibration used in this paper is only accurate to @xmath26 10% , 2% , 2% , 2% and 7% , in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands , respectively .",
    "thus as in papers i and ii , we will denote the preliminary sdss magnitudes presented here as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , rather than the notation @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 that will be used for the final sdss photometry , which will have photometric accuracy of @xmath32 for bright sources .    in this paper",
    ", we select bright ( @xmath4 ) high - redshift quasar candidates from two sdss imaging runs ( run 94 and 125 , see table b1 ) in the fall equatorial stripe at high galactic latitude ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "these two runs form a filled _ stripe _ 2.5 degrees wide in declination , centered on the celestial equator .",
    "some quasars found from these two runs have already been presented in paper i and in schneider et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "the photometric data reduction procedures are described in paper i. in this paper , we use the photometric catalogs produced by the most recent version of the sdss photometric pipeline , which now corrects for the time and spatial variation of the point spread function ( psf ) within a given @xmath34 ccd frame , improving both the photometric accuracy and the star - galaxy separation .",
    "the 5-@xmath35 limiting magnitudes are similar to those of papers i and ii , roughly 22.3 , 22.6 , 22.7 , 22.4 and 20.5 in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively , for a single observation . the photometry from the new reduction has changed slightly from the those in paper i , but the differences are almost always smaller than the quoted photometric errors .",
    "figure 1 presents the color - color diagrams for all stellar sources at @xmath36 in 25 deg@xmath5 of the sdss imaging data .",
    "the inner parts of the diagrams are shown as contours , linearly spaced in density of stars per unit area on the color - color diagram .",
    "as in papers i and ii , only sources that are detected in all three relevant bands at more than 5 @xmath35 are plotted .",
    "the median tracks of quasar colors as a function of redshift from @xcite are also displayed in figure 1 .",
    "high - redshift quasar candidates were selected using color cuts similar to those presented in papers i and ii .",
    "the final criteria we use to define the color - selected complete sample in  4 are based on the colors _ after _ correcting for galactic extinction using the reddening map of @xcite .",
    "the criteria are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath37 candidates , selected principally from the @xmath38 diagram :    @xmath39    \\2 .",
    "@xmath40 candidates , selected principally from the @xmath41 diagram :    @xmath42    the intersections of those color cuts with the @xmath43 and @xmath44 diagrams are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the final criteria are more restrictive than those used in papers i and ii , in the sense that the cuts are further away from the stellar locus .",
    "because of the limited observing time for spectroscopic follow - up observations , we used this tighter cut to limit the number of contaminants among the candidates in order to complete the sample in the fall 1999 observing season .",
    "this modification increases the observing efficiency at the cost of lower selection completeness .",
    "the completeness function of the color selection criteria , and the effects of different selection constraints on the sample are presented in  5 . in the sdss main spectroscopic survey ,",
    "the quasar candidates are selected in multi - dimensional color space using a more complicated algorithm ( newberg et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation , see also @xcite ) .",
    "paper i presented the photometry of two previously known quasars from run 94 data . in run 125 ( in an area not covered by paper i ) , two additional quasars are recovered .",
    "sdssp j005922.65 + 000301.4ddmmss.s , where `` p '' stands for the preliminary sdss astrometry , and the positions are expressed in j2000.0 coordinates .",
    "the astrometry is accurate to better than @xmath45 in each axis . ]",
    "is reported in @xcite as pss 0059 + 0003 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "no information on the other quasar , sdssp j024457.19010809.9 , has been published in the literature , but it is reported at the dposs website as pss 02440108 .",
    "we obtained its spectrum in order to measure its spectral properties .",
    "thirty - three quasar candidates that meet the criteria described in  2 were observed in the fall 1999 observing season using the keck ii telescope and the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "twenty - five of the candidates are identified as high - redshift quasars at @xmath14 .",
    "the het observations of 11 new quasars are presented in a separate paper ( schneider et al .",
    "2000b ) . here",
    "we present the keck observations .",
    "spectra of 12 sdss high - redshift quasars were taken with the keck ii telescope , using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , @xcite ) on the nights of 1999 october 15 and 16 .",
    "a 300 line mm@xmath12 grating was used .",
    "two quasars ( sdssp j012700.69@xmath47004559.1 and sdssp j021043.17@xmath47001818.4 ) were observed with keck ii / lris on 1999 july 21 , when a 400 line mm@xmath12 grating was used .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 600  s to 1200  s. observations of the spectrophotometric standard feige 110 ( @xcite , @xcite ) were used to provide flux calibrations and to correct for telluric absorption , and observations of hg - ne - ar lamps were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectra were reduced with standard iraf procedures .",
    "the calibrated spectra extend from 4000   to 9000   for the 300 line mm@xmath12 grating spectra , with a dispersion of 2.4  / pixel . note that at 8000 @xmath48  , the spectrum is slightly affected by second - order contamination from 4000 @xmath49  .",
    "however , there is little flux at at @xmath50  for high - redshift quasars due to the absorption systems , and we did not notice any order - overlap effect in the data . the second - order effect , however , does somewhat affect the standard star observation , the flux calibration , and the removal of the telluric bands .",
    "the spectral coverage is 4000   to 8000   for the 400 line mm@xmath12 grating spectra , with a dispersion of 1.9  / pixel .",
    "the resolution of the lris spectra is @xmath51  .",
    "in addition , spectra of sdssp j024457.19010809.9 ( pss 02440108 ) were obtained with the arc 3.5 m telescope using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the night of 1999 december 28 for a total exposure time of 2400 s. the dis instrument and spectral data reduction procedures were described in paper  i.    table 1 gives the positions , sdss photometry and redshifts of the 14 new sdss high - redshift quasars , and the photometric run from which they were selected , as well as the sdss measurements of the two previously - known quasars .",
    "the photometry is expressed in asinh magnitudes ( @xcite , see also paper i ) .",
    "the photometric errors given are only statistical , and do not include calibration errors .",
    "note that all but one objects presented in this paper are selected from run 125 .",
    "most of the candidates from run 94 are presented in paper i and in @xcite .",
    "positions of the 16 confirmed sdss quasars presented in this paper are plotted on the color - color diagrams ( figure 1a and 1c ) as filled circles .",
    "positions of other quasars in the same survey area and non - quasars that satisfied the selection criteria are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "finding charts of all objects in table 1 are given in figure 2 .",
    "they are @xmath52 @xmath24 band sdss images with an effective exposure time of 54.1 seconds .",
    "we matched the positions of quasars in table 2 against the first radio survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "three of them have first counterparts at 20 cm at the 1 mjy level ( with positional matches better than @xmath53 ) : sdssp j013108.19 + 005248.2 ( @xmath54 ) , sdssp j021043.17001818.4 ( @xmath11 ) and sdssp j030025.23 + 003224.2 ( @xmath54 ) , correspond to unresolved first sources of 4.00 , 9.75 and 7.56 mjy at 20 cm , respectively .",
    "in particular , sdssp j021043.17001818.4 ( @xmath11 ) is the highest redshift radio - loud luminous quasar yet known .",
    "none of the objects was detected in the rosat full - sky pixel images ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) at a typical 3@xmath35 upper limit of @xmath55 erg s@xmath12 @xmath56 in the 0.1  2.4 kev band .    figure 3 presents the spectra of the 14 newly discovered sdss quasars and of sdssp j024457.19010809.9 ( pss 02440108 ) . in the figure",
    ", we place the spectra on an absolute flux scale ( to compensate for the uncertainties due to non - photometric conditions and variable seeing during the night ) by forcing the synthetic @xmath30 magnitudes from the spectra to be the same as the sdss photometric measurements .",
    "the emission line properties of the quasars are listed in table 2 .",
    "central wavelengths and rest frame equivalent widths of five major emission lines are measured following the procedures of paper i.      we assume the quasar continuum is a power law with a slope @xmath8 : @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) .",
    "the continuum magnitude , @xmath59 , is defined as the ab magnitude at @xmath60   in the rest frame corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "ab magnitude can be converted to flux units as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 has units of erg s@xmath12 @xmath56 hz@xmath12 . for a power law continuum",
    ", @xmath59 can be converted to the rest - frame kron - cousins b band magnitude : @xmath63 the effective wavelength in the b band is 4400  , and the factor 0.12 is the zeropoint difference between the ab magnitude system and the vega - based system in the b band ( @xcite ) .",
    "table 3 gives the continuum properties of the quasars .",
    "as in paper i , redshifts are determined from all emission lines redward of ly@xmath8 ; ly@xmath8 itself is not used , due to absorption from the ly@xmath8 forest on its blue side .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath59 can be determined from the spectrum alone .",
    "however , not all our observations were carried out under photometric conditions or with the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "the observed continuum range redward of the ly@xmath8 emission covered by the spectra ( @xmath64   to 9000  ) of these high - redshift quasars is typically only few hundred   in the rest frame .",
    "moreover , some of the spectra have rather poor signal - to - noise ratio beyond 8000  . thus , in some cases , it is difficult to determine accurately the continuum slope @xmath8 from the observed spectrum",
    ".    however , the broad - band photometry gives us an alternative method to determine the slope .",
    "the intrinsic quasar spectrum can be modeled as a power - law continuum plus a series of emission lines .",
    "the equivalent width of the lines can be measured quite accurately from the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the slope of the power - law can be determined by matching the spectral model to the broad - band photometry .",
    "the sdss @xmath25 cutoff is beyond 10,000  , so this gives a broader baseline over which to determine the slope .",
    "moreover , the absolute photometric calibration is more accurate .",
    "the contribution to the broad - band colors from emission lines other than ly@xmath8 is also small .",
    "however , only bands which are not affected by ly@xmath8 forest lines can be used in this method . at @xmath65 , ly@xmath8 moves into the @xmath24 band , making it impossible to determine the slope from the @xmath25 measurement alone .",
    "therefore , we develop a method to fit the continuum slope @xmath8 and to derive @xmath59 of the quasar using information from both the observed spectrum and the broad - band photometry .",
    "briefly , we construct a quasar spectral model that uses the observed spectrum blueward of ly@xmath8 emission and the power - law continuum plus emission line model redward of ly@xmath8 emission , and determine @xmath8 and @xmath59 by finding the model that fits the photometry the best . in detail , the method consists of following steps :    * ( 1 ) obtain a corrected observed spectrum @xmath66 that matches the sdss photometry . * for quasars with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the photometric errors in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands",
    "are small ( @xmath69 mag ) .",
    "we apply an additional correction function linear in wavelength ( with two free parameters , a zeropoint and a slope ) to the spectrum so that the synthetic photometry reproduces the sdss @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes . for objects at @xmath70 , the ly@xmath8 forest moves into @xmath23 , increasing the error in the @xmath23 band",
    ", therefore we only apply a zeropoint shift to match the @xmath30 magnitude .    * ( 2 ) for a given @xmath8 and @xmath59 , construct a model spectrum @xmath71 : * @xmath72^{-\\alpha-2 } \\cdot \\sum_i [ 1+\\mbox{ew}_i p(\\lambda - \\lambda_0^i ) ] & \\mbox{if $ \\lambda > $ 1260 \\aa $ \\times ( 1+z)$. }          \\end{array }      \\right .",
    "%    \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    for @xmath73 , we use the flux from the corrected observed spectrum @xmath66 .",
    "the observed profile for the ly@xmath8+n v emission line is used as the line is strongly affected by the ly@xmath8 forest absorption . for @xmath74 , the model spectrum has three components :    \\(a ) a power law continuum with @xmath75 and continuum magnitude @xmath59 ; ( b ) emission lines .",
    "we use the equivalent widths measured in table 2 for strong lines . for weak lines",
    ", we use the line ratios in @xcite to scale from the measured ly@xmath8+n v emission line strength .",
    "the line profile @xmath76 is assumed to be a gaussian with fwhm of 5000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the choice of fwhm has negligible effect on the broad - band colors ;    \\(c ) if there is any broad absorption or strong associated absorption system in the spectrum , the equivalent widths and fwhms are measured and the lines are added to the spectrum .    * ( 3 ) obtain the best fit @xmath8 and @xmath59 . * first , for a given @xmath77 ,",
    "the synthetic sdss magnitudes @xmath78 are calculated from the model spectrum .",
    "we add the statistical error in table 1 and the calibration error (  2 ) of the sdss photometry in quadrature to obtain the final photometric error @xmath79 .",
    "then we minimize the total @xmath80 of the differences between the synthetic magnitudes and the sdss photometry @xmath81 with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath59 : @xmath82 for quasars at @xmath68 , @xmath83 is still inside the sdss @xmath23 band , while the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands are dominated by the absorption systems .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 magnitudes are used . for quasars at @xmath70 , only @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 magnitudes can provide useful constraints on the continuum slope , and only these bands are used in the fit .",
    "the 1-@xmath35 errors on the parameters are estimated by finding the values that give @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is for the best - fit parameters .",
    "the error on @xmath8 is @xmath86 for @xmath68 and @xmath87 for @xmath70 , and the error on @xmath59 is typically a few percent .",
    "the best - fit values and 1-@xmath35 errors of @xmath8 and @xmath59 are given in table 3 .",
    "an example of the result of this fitting procedure is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the major reason for determining @xmath8 in this paper is to estimate the selection completeness of the survey , as the selection probability varies with different continuum shape ( and therefore different broad - band colors ) . for objects with high signal - to - noise ratio spectra ,",
    "the @xmath8 values determined from the spectra and from the method above are usually consistent with each other within the quoted error . determining @xmath8 using broad - band photometry does not depend on the selection of a continuum window , and the error bar is easy to interpret .",
    "the best - fit @xmath8 using the method above always minimizes the difference between model and observed colors . by tying to the observed colors rather than fitting the observed spectra , the effect of photometric calibration errors ( at 2%",
    "7% level in this paper ) on the selection completeness calculation is minimized : an error on the photometric calibration or uncertainties in the filter response would give rise to a wrong best - fit @xmath8 , but to first order , the spectral model in  5 based on these @xmath8 values should still reproduce the observed color distribution .",
    "for the survey selection function (  5 ) and the quasar luminosity function ( paper iv ) , the calculations are carried out in two cosmologies : a model with @xmath88 and @xmath89 km s@xmath12 km@xmath12 , where we refer to as the @xmath90 model hereafter ; and a @xmath91-dominated flat model with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 km s@xmath12 km@xmath12 , which we refer to as the @xmath91-model hereafter . in this paper ,",
    "most of the results are presented using the @xmath90 model .",

    "note that most of the non - quasars are very close to the selection boundary .    in table 4",
    ", we present the properties of the 39 quasars .",
    "the continuum magnitude and the continuum slope are calculated following the procedures described in  3.1 . for quasars in paper",
    "i , these quantities are re - measured based on improved ( although not final ) sdss photometry . for the three previously known quasars for which we did not obtain new spectra , we use the spectral properties measured in @xcite and @xcite and the sdss photometry to derive their continuum magnitudes and power - law slopes .",
    "table 4 also lists the detection probability of each quasar , which is described in the next section .",
    "the sample in table 4 covers a redshift range of @xmath119 , and an absolute magnitude range of @xmath120 for the @xmath90 model .",
    "this is the largest complete sample of quasars at @xmath14 to date .",
    "it includes 18 quasars at @xmath121 and six at @xmath65 , enabling us to determine the quasar number density at @xmath122 ( paper iv ) . by comparison , the schmidt , schneider & gunn ( 1995 ) sample has 9 quasars at @xmath121 with one at @xmath65 , and the @xcite sample includes 10 quasars at @xmath121 with a highest redshift of 4.45",
    ".    about 10% of optically selected low - redshift quasars are bals ( @xcite ) . in this sample ,",
    "two of the quasars ( sdssp j023909.98002121.5 and sdssp j024457.19010809.9 ) are classical bal quasars ; two other quasars ( sdssp 015048.83 + 004126.2 and sdssp 033910.53003009.2 ) are candidate mini - bal quasars .",
    "the result is consistent with the fraction found in low - redshift samples .",
    "however , some of the spectra have poor signal - to - noise ratio , and we have not yet applied an objective criteria for selecting bals to all the spectra , so this fraction is likely to be a lower limit .",
    "at least one object , sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 ( @xmath123 ) , also shows a strong and broad civ absorption feature in a high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1995 ) and @xcite found that about 10% of known quasars at @xmath124 ( most of which are also color - selected ) are detected at radio wavelengths at the mjy level .",
    "four quasars in our sample are first radio sources with total flux of 4.0  9.8 mjy at 20 cm",
    ". although our sample size is still small , the fraction of radio - loud quasars in our sample is consistent with the previous results .",
    "to derive the luminosity function of high - redshift quasars from the color - selected sample in table 4 , we first need to calculate the selection function .",
    "it is defined as the probability , @xmath125 , that a quasar of a given @xmath95 , @xmath126 , and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) will satisfy the color selection criteria ( eqs . 1 and 2 )",
    ", in this section , we calculate the selection function using a monte - carlo simulation of quasar colors , based on the quasar spectral model described in @xcite .",
    "similar procedures were adopted to calculate the selection function for multicolor quasar surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the measured colors of a quasar at a certain redshift and luminosity are determined by three factors : its intrinsic sed ; the absorption systems that are distributed randomly along the line of sight ; and the photometric errors . in ",
    "5.1 , we describe the quasar spectral model and calculate the detection probability @xmath127 of individual quasars , taking into account the effects of the distribution of absorption systems and photometric errors .",
    "we discuss in detail how this probability varies with different parameters , and how the selection criteria affect the sample completeness . in ",
    "5.2 , we calculate the distribution of the intrinsic properties of quasars , the continuum slopes @xmath8 and equivalent widths of ly@xmath8+n v emission , based on the sample in table 4 , after correcting for the detection probability calculated in  5.1 . finally ,",
    "in  5.3 , we calculate the average selection probability of the quasar sample as a function of redshift and luminosity .      to determine the detection probability",
    ", we first calculate the synthetic distribution of quasar colors at a given @xmath128 , following the procedures described in @xcite . as in that paper and in  3.1 , the intrinsic quasar spectrum model , including a power law continuum and a series of emission lines , is parameterized by the continuum slope @xmath8 and the rest - frame equivalent width of the ly@xmath8+nv emission line , ew(ly@xmath8+nv ) ( abbreviated to ew in what follows ) .",
    "the synthetic absorption spectrum takes into account intervening hi absorbers along the line of sight , including ly@xmath8 forest systems , lyman limit systems and damped lyman @xmath8 systems .",
    "we use the distribution functions of each kind of absorber used by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the sdss magnitudes from the model spectrum and add photometric errors in each band .",
    "our precedures differ in two ways from those of appendix a of @xcite .",
    "first , we use updated sdss filter response functions as described in appendix a. they are slightly different from those of fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; in particular , the long - wavelength cutoff of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters are 100  300   bluer in the new measurements than in the old ones .",
    "for these broad - band filters , this difference has only a small effect on the colors of normal stars .",
    "however , it does affect the model quasar colors in certain redshift ranges for which the strong ly@xmath8 emission line is near a filter edge .",
    "second , in the current calculation , we use the measured seeing for runs 94 and 125 , @xmath129 , to derive the photon noise of the psf photometry .",
    "the seeing in these commissioning runs is worse than the @xmath130 seeing assumed in @xcite .",
    "we further add the systematic calibration error in each band in quadrature to the random errors , as in  3.1 .",
    "for each object in the complete sample , a total of 1000 model quasars with the same @xmath131 are generated , and sdss magnitudes calculated .",
    "the fraction of these which satisfy the selection criteria of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is defined to be the detection probability @xmath132 , as listed in table 4 .",
    "it ranges from @xmath133 for objects located in the part of the color - color diagrams farthest away from the stellar locus ( see figure 1 ) to @xmath134 for the objects near the boundary of the selection criteria .",
    "an object with a given intrinsic spectrum can move in and out of the selected region in color space due to differing amounts of absorption and photometric errors .",
    "the average probability @xmath135 for the whole sample .",
    "this is considerably higher than that of warren et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , @xmath136 ; the higher photometric accuracy with ccds enables us to probe much closer to the stellar locus in color space than do surveys using photographic plate data .",
    "note that the spectral model above does not include contributions from bals .",
    "for the four possible bal quasars in our sample , we also calculate the detection probability by adding the observed bal troughs in the model spectra .",
    "the detection probability changed by @xmath137 in all four cases .",
    "there is no systematic effect and @xmath138 remains at 0.78 for the whole sample .    the color - selection criteria in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) choose regions in color space well - separated from the stellar locus .",
    "quasars with redder continua ( larger @xmath139 ) and weaker emission lines are located in regions in the color - color diagrams close to normal stars .",
    "any color - based selection will naturally select against these quasars . there may exist quasars with an intrinsic sed shape such that their broad - band colors are so similar to normal stars that their detection probability is close to zero .",
    "thus it is difficult to correctly estimate the fraction of quasars that we would never find without assuming an _ a priori _ model for the intrinsic distribution of @xmath8 and ew .",
    "the selection probability is also a strong function of the redshift and luminosity of the quasar . in figure 5",
    ", we present the detection probability as a function of @xmath8 and ew at several different redshifts and luminosities to illustrate the dependence of @xmath132 on these parameters .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows @xmath132 at @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath90 model ) ; this is near the lower redshift cutoff of the survey .",
    "the quasar is much brighter than the flux limit , so photometric errors are not important . in this case , a quasar with @xmath142 and ew = 70  , which are the mean values we derive in  5.2 , has @xmath143 80% ; the completeness is rather high . the completeness is lower for objects with redder continua or weaker emission lines .",
    "the detectability drops to @xmath144 at @xmath145 , where @xmath146 .",
    "this selection bias is introduced by the selection criterion @xmath147 .",
    "this eliminates a large number of compact e+a galaxies at @xmath148 which have very similar @xmath149 and @xmath150 colors to @xmath151 quasars but are intrinsically redder than are quasars . in the final selection of the sdss main quasar sample",
    ", this condition will be relaxed . for objects with weak emission lines ,",
    "@xmath132 drops for bluer continua as well . at @xmath152 , such objects could have @xmath153 , and are thus excluded by the cut eq",
    "this bias only affects redshifts close to the cutoff .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows @xmath132 at @xmath140 and @xmath154 , corresponding to @xmath155 .",
    "this figure is for the same redshift as figure 5(a ) , but at the survey limiting luminosity . in this case",
    ", @xmath132 is much lower . at a given absolute magnitude ,",
    "the _ observed _ apparent magnitudes of a substantial fraction of quasars will be below the apparent magnitude cut ( @xmath156 ) due to photometric errors .",
    "in addition , the large error in the @xmath22 band will scatter more quasars out of the selected region .",
    "however , the selection is actually somewhat more sensitive to larger @xmath8 here than for brighter objects at the same redshift ( figure 5a ) : @xmath157 for @xmath158 .",
    "this is because the photometric error in @xmath25 is @xmath159 mag , scattering some objects with red intrinsic continua back into the sample with @xmath160 .    at @xmath161 ,",
    "the ly@xmath8 emission has moved out of the sdss @xmath23 band , and lies in the gap between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus neither the @xmath37 nor the @xmath40 selection are sensitive to these quasars .",
    "figure 5(c ) shows the detection probability at this redshift and at @xmath162 , near the survey limiting luminosity .",
    "this is the region where the survey is most incomplete . for typical values of @xmath8 and",
    "emission line strength , @xmath163 . at most redshifts ,",
    "the presence of a strong ly@xmath8 emission line makes the lyman break in the spectrum more distinct , pushing the object further away from the stellar locus in color space . at @xmath164 , however , with the ly@xmath8 emission line in the gap , quasars are closer to the stellar locus than either at higher or lower redshift , making them difficult to select . at @xmath165 ( see figure 1 ) , the presence of strong ly@xmath8 forest absorption in the spectrum causes the object to be very well separated from the stellar locus in the @xmath150 vs. @xmath166 color - color diagram .",
    "figure 5(d ) shows that at @xmath167 , the selection completeness is very high , even for objects with weak emission lines or red continua .",
    "sdss 153200 ( @xcite ) , a @xmath168 quasar without emission lines , was found in the sdss spring equatorial stripe data using with the same selection criteria .",
    "this demonstrates that our selection is not sensitive to emission line strength in this redshift range .",
    "thus , except in the redshift range @xmath169 and for luminosities near the survey limit , the detection probability is high and the selection criteria are sensitive to a large range of ( @xmath8 , ew ) .",
    "we will further examine the average selection function in  5.3 after deriving the distribution functions of the continuum slope and emission line strength in our sample .      in this subsection",
    ", we use the sample in table 4 to estimate the distributions of @xmath8 and ew(ly@xmath8+nv ) , after correcting the selection probability of each quasar .",
    "we first calculate their weighted means , then derive their distribution functions using a maximum likelihood approach and assume gaussian distributions .",
    "the histograms in figure 6 show the observed distributions of the power - law continuum slope , @xmath8 , and the rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath8+nv emission , ew . using only the 35 non - bal quasars , and weighting each object by the inverse of its selection probability @xmath170 ( table 4 ) , we find a mean ew of 71.0   with a standard deviation of 18.3  , at an average redshift @xmath171 .",
    "similarly , using all 39 quasars in the sample , and applying a weight of @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the error on the @xmath8 measurement , we find a mean @xmath8 of @xmath174 with a standard deviation of 0.40 .    however , these distributions can be biased if there is a population of quasars with small @xmath132 which are totally missing from the sample .",
    "thus , we use a maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the likelihood of the observed @xmath175 is given by : @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the distribution functions of @xmath8 and ew .",
    "we assume both to be gaussian , and uncorrelated with each other , @xmath179.\\ ] ] where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the mean and standard deviation of its intrinsic distribution .",
    "similarly , @xmath182.\\ ] ]    note that the normalizing integral @xmath183 in the denominator of the likelihood function is essential ; without it , the maximum likelihood solution would not depend on the choice of @xmath132 , which is clearly wrong .",
    "however , as we show in  5.1 , the selection function @xmath132 is a complicated function of @xmath95 , @xmath126 , @xmath8 and ew .",
    "this integral can not be evaluated without knowing the underlying distribution function of @xmath126 and @xmath95 , namely , the luminosity function .",
    "a full solution requires maximizing the likelihood of the full distribution function @xmath184 .",
    "we will present the maximum likelihood solution of the luminosity function in paper iv , but we find that the distributions of @xmath8 and ew are rather insensitive to the choice of luminosity function , as it provides a weighting of the probability function , which is only a slow varying function of @xmath126 and @xmath95 . using the luminosity function we find in paper iv ( for the @xmath90 model ) , @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the cumulative luminosity function in units of comoving mpc@xmath187 , we find : @xmath188  , @xmath189  , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . in figure 6 ,",
    "the average @xmath8 value from the maximum likelihood solution is clearly offset from the _ observed _ distribution , due to the selection bias against objects with redder continua .",
    "the results above assume that the distributions of @xmath8 and ew are not correlated with each other or with redshift or luminosity .",
    "luminosity and emission line strength are known to be correlated ( the baldwin ( 1977 ) effect ) , although for the small luminosity range ( 2 mag ) our sample covers , this is a rather small effect .",
    "these results change by less than 5% for a change of the parameters in the assumed luminosity function by @xmath192 .",
    "these statistics can be compared with results from previous studies .",
    "based on 30 quasars at @xmath193 , schneider et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found @xmath194  .",
    "note that most of the quasars in schneider et al .",
    "( 1991 ) are selected based on their slitless spectra , and are biased to quasars with stronger emission lines .",
    "@xcite found @xmath195 for a sample of 59 quasars at @xmath196 .",
    "@xcite found a median equivalent width of @xmath197   for quasars at @xmath198 .",
    "our result is consistent with these high - redshift samples . at lower redshift , the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) sample has ew(ly@xmath8+nv ) = 52   ( francis et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "schneider et al . ( 1991 ) found @xmath199 , and @xcite found @xmath200 , both consistent with our result .",
    "our value is redder than the values found from low redshift samples ( e.g. , the lbqs sample shows @xmath201 ) .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the @xmath8 values from low and high redshift samples are based on different wavelength ranges .",
    "a detailed comparison of the continuum slope for different redshift ranges would require observations of high - redshift quasars at ir wavelengths . however , our purpose in determining @xmath8 is to reproduce the true color distribution of the underlying quasar population and thus to calculate the selection function .",
    "since we measure @xmath8 by matching to the sdss photometry , any bias will be small because of the limited wavelength range in the optical spectrum of high - redshift quasars .",
    "the difference in the continuum slope between the low and high redshift sample and any deviations of the underlying continuum from a power law , however , will affect the calculation of the k - correction , and the evolution of the luminosity function from @xmath202 to @xmath203 ( paper iv ) .      in figure 7 , we present the average selection probability for @xmath204 , as functions of @xmath8 and ew , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 , averaged over the survey redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath205 is defined as : @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the differential luminosity function .",
    "the quantity @xmath206 is similarly defined .",
    "this figure illustrates the selection completeness as a function of the quasar sed in  5.1 more clearly . on average , the selection criteria are more sensitive to quasars with bluer continua . at this luminosity ,",
    "where the effects of photometric errors are small , the average selection probability @xmath209 for @xmath210 , but drops to @xmath134 for @xmath211 , and to @xmath144 for @xmath212 .",
    "note that @xmath211 is about 2 @xmath35 away from the mean @xmath8 .",
    "thus although the current survey is less complete for redder quasars , those objects are not excluded completely and can be corrected for by applying the selection function .",
    "the figure also shows that the average selection probability is higher than 80% for quasars with ew @xmath213 40  , and is still higher than 50% for quasars with much weaker lines , ew @xmath26 20  .",
    "finally , we calculate the average selection probability of the high - redshift quasars in our sample as a function of redshift and luminosity @xmath214 , averaging over the @xmath8 and ew distributions .",
    "we calculate the quasar model colors following the same procedures described in  5.1 , and assume that the intrinsic properties of quasars follow the distributions we obtained in  5.2 .",
    "the selection function is calculated for both @xmath90 and @xmath91 models for @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "the results of the selection function are summarized in figure 8 for both cosmologies .",
    "the heavy solid line in the figure represents the 5% contour , indicating the survey limiting absolute magnitude at each redshift .",
    "our survey is cut at @xmath156 for @xmath37 selected quasars , and at @xmath217 for @xmath40 selected quasars . for the @xmath90 model , the survey reaches @xmath218 at the lowest redshift @xmath219 , and to @xmath220 at @xmath161 .",
    "the survey then goes slightly deeper at @xmath221 , due to the fact that our @xmath40 selection goes slightly deeper than does the @xmath37 selection .",
    "not surprisingly , the survey is more complete for brighter quasars due to smaller photometric errors .",
    "the figure indicates that over the entire redshift range between 3.6 and 5.2 , the survey is complete to at least 40% for quasars more than @xmath222 mag brighter than the survey limit .",
    "the main difference between the two cosmologies is a slight shift in the @xmath95 axis .",
    "the survey completeness is a function of redshift : it is most complete in the redshift ranges of 3.8  4.2 and 4.7  5.2 , with @xmath223 for bright quasars . as mentioned in  5.1",
    ", the lower completeness at @xmath224 is due to the @xmath225 cut in the @xmath37 selection .",
    "the completeness is lowest at @xmath226 , about 50% for bright quasars .",
