    "a _ spherical parallel mechanism ( spm ) _ refers to a moving platform rotated about a fixed point by manipulators with three degrees of freedom .",
    "this fixed point is designated as the center of spherical motion .",
    "this type of mechanism may find numerous applications in orientating devices and modelings wrists by exploiting some advantages in parallel architecture .",
    "such advantages include accuracy , repeatability in positioning , and excellent dynamic properties . in the literature ,",
    "numerous spm architectures have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies covering a variety of relevant problems ( workspace modeling , dexterity evaluation , design and optimization , singularity analysis and type synthesis ) have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the _ forward displacement problem ( fdp ) _ of spms is concerned with finding the orientation of the moving platform for a given set of actuated - joint - variable values . however , due to their multi - loop architecture , there does not exist a closed form solution to the general problem .",
    "moreover , the presence of transcendental equations suggests a high computational complexity .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , the problem admits at most eight solutions , from the roots of an eighth - order polynomial equation , known as the _ robot characteristic equation_. gosselin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a method solving the fdp for spms with only revolute joints . in this method ,",
    "the orientation of the end - effector is described by euler angles .",
    "solutions in the form of an eighth - order polynomial equation were found .",
    "a similar solution was reported by huang and yao  @xcite , who regarded the direction cosines of each joint axis as functions of the actuated - joint variables .",
    "innocenti and parenti - castelli  @xcite solved the fdp for spms with prismatic joints deriving a system of two equations , one eighth - order polynomial and one linear equation .",
    "recently , bai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite revisited the problem , proposing a method based on the input - output equation of spherical four - bar linkages .",
    "+ in this paper , the closed - loop kinematic chain of a spm is partitioned into two four - bar spherical chains leading to a trigonometric equation in the joint angles , which is solved semi - graphically to obtain the joint variables for the determination of the moving platform orientation .",
    "+ the idea behind this paper is to find an analytical method to solve the fdp of spms in radicals that obey a certain geometric condition .",
    "the method proposed , exploits the quaternion algebra and the dixon determinant procedure .",
    "this approach benefits the fdp in the following respects : + _ ( i ) _ the quaternion algebra is well suited for the spherical kinematics because it does not have the singularities or transcendental equations any three parameter representation gives .",
    "( ii ) _ the dixon method is computationally inexpensive for a fixed set of parameters so a given system may have its solutions calculated efficiently . + _ ( iii ) _ in the case of symbolic parameters , the dixon method outputs a twenty by twenty matrices whose determinant are the coordinates of the solutions . + _",
    "( iv ) _ the fdp of some spm s may be solved in terms of radicals using these methods .",
    "the procedure proposed in the paper can be applied to spms subjected to the following geometric condition for each leg : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are vectors in @xmath7 denoting the orientation of the axes of the motor joints .",
    "see figure 1 for an example .",
    "the @xmath8 are vectors in @xmath7 denoting the orientation of the axes of the moving platform , and the @xmath9 s are constants .",
    "equation (  [ eq_geometrical_condition ] ) and others are satisfied in the @xmath10  @xcite and in the @xmath11  @xcite . in equation (  [ eq_geometrical_condition ] ) , the vectors are both expressed in a fixed orthonormal reference system with origin coinciding with the center of the spherical rotation .",
    "however , we define a reference system @xmath12 on top of the moving platform such that @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the vector @xmath8 expressed in @xmath12 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 is an orientation matrix with entries determined by the unit quaternions @xmath16  @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 a basis for the quaternion algebra .",
    "it can be shown @xmath16 is expressed with entries in the real numbers @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22 .\\nonumber\\ ] ] in addition to the three geometric conditions , the use of unit quaternions gives a fourth normalizing condition .",
    "indeed , every quaternion @xmath16 has a conjugate @xmath23 $ ] , which satisfies @xmath24 while there are several known representations of @xmath15 , this one using four parameters , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , offers robustness against the singularities arising in any three parameter representation .",
    "equations (  [ eq_geometrical_condition ] ) , (  [ eq_unit_quaternion_definition ] ) define a system of four quadric polynomial equations @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 with 4 unknowns : @xmath18 ,  @xmath31 providing the orientation of the moving platform when the motor angles are given ( _ i.e. _ , solution of the fd problem ) .",
    "we have rephrased our kinematics problem into the problem of solving a system of four quadrics in four unknowns @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "the _ dixon determinant _ method is used .",
    "we now show how to derive a _ dixon matrix _ , which vanishes at coordinates of the solutions .",
    "in 1908 , dixon developed a criterion  @xcite to determine when four quadrics in three unknowns vanish at a common point .",
    "this criterion claims the four quadrics vanish at a common point , if a certain @xmath33 matrix is singular .",
    "we call this matrix a dixon matrix .",
    "its entries will be determined by the coefficients of twenty specially chosen cubics in three unknowns . given a system of four quadrics in four unknowns , the same criterion can be used to determine the coordinates of solutions . by considering different combinations of the coordinates",
    ", we have a finite list which contains our solution set . using this technique",
    ", we illustrate the @xmath0 case followed by an explicit numerical example . +   + we set notation by recalling algebraic geometry facts from  @xcite to derive a dixon matrix .",
    "let @xmath34 be in the polynomial ring @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "we set @xmath36 and say @xmath37 is the affine variety defined by @xmath34 over @xmath38 .",
    "the affine variety @xmath37 is the set of points in @xmath39 which are solutions to the system defined by @xmath34 .",
    "we set @xmath40\\right\\ } $ ] and call @xmath41 the ideal generated by @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath42 ( usually a variety of an ideal ) be a subset of @xmath43 .",
    "then we set @xmath44\\mid f\\left(a_{1},\\dots , a_{n}\\right)=0\\,\\text{for all}\\,\\left(a_{1},\\dots , a_{n}\\right)\\in v\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] we call @xmath45 the ideal of @xmath42 . taking",
    "the ideal of two affine varieties reverses containment .",
    "so given two affine varieties @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 if and only if @xmath48 .    generally , we include parameters @xmath49 in the coefficients of @xmath34 . in this case ,",
    "we say @xmath50 $ ] are polynomials in the unknowns @xmath51 with coefficients in @xmath52 . by replacing @xmath38 with @xmath52 we have analogous definitions of variety and ideal over an algebraic closure of @xmath52 .",
    "+      in this paper we will consider the polynomial ring @xmath53 $ ] . in this ring ,",
    "we say a polynomial @xmath54 is a cubic in @xmath55 if we can write @xmath56\\cdot [ l]\\ ] ] with @xmath57 $ ] equal to @xmath58^{t},\\ ] ] and the entries of @xmath59 $ ] in @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath61 is the usual dot product .",
    "we say the @xmath62-th entry of @xmath59 $ ] is the coefficient of the @xmath62-th entry of @xmath63 $ ] , and say @xmath59 $ ] is the coefficient row vector of the cubic @xmath54",
    ".    given four quadrics @xmath64 $ ] , we show how to derive a certain list of twenty cubics , which vanish on @xmath65 . from that list of twenty cubics ,",
    "we construct a dixon matrix by taking its @xmath62-th row to be the coefficient row vector of the @xmath62-th cubic in the list .",
    "since there are twenty monomials of degree three or less in three unknowns , the matrix we construct will be square and have a determinant .",
    "the twenty cubics are chosen so that the vanishing of this determinant provides information about the system of four quadrics .",
    "specifically , the first four cubics in our list are chosen to be @xmath66 , regarded as cubics whose first ten coefficients are zero .",
    "the next twelve cubics are chosen as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the final four cubics in our list of twenty will be constructed below . after defining these",
    ", we give the definition of a @xmath70 @xmath71 and state how it is used in the criterion .    to construct the final four cubics , we first construct a matrix @xmath72 determined by the @xmath73 $ ] . let @xmath74.\\ ] ] since @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 respectively identically vanish when @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we can write @xmath81\\\\ = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } \\left(x_{1}-y_{1}\\right ) h_{i1}(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},y_{1 } ) , & \\left(x_{2}-y_{2}\\right ) h_{i2}(x_{2},x_{3},y_{1},y_{2 } ) , & \\left(x_{3}-y_{3}\\right ) h_{i3}(x_{3},y_{1},y_{2},y_{3})\\end{array}\\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] with linear forms @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "so @xmath83.\\ ] ] with these two formulations of @xmath72 we prove the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath84 $ ] , @xmath85 $ ] , and @xmath72 be as above .",
    "let @xmath86 , with @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath88 are of degree @xmath89 or less , then @xmath90 vanish on @xmath65 and are cubics in the unknowns @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 denote the @xmath62-th column of @xmath72 .",
    "then , for any point @xmath94 , @xmath95 is identically the zero vector when @xmath96 . to see this , we note the @xmath62-th entry of this vector is @xmath97 which equals @xmath98 simplifying to @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "so the columns of @xmath72 are linearly dependent and the determinant of @xmath72 vanishes .",
    "this means that @xmath102 vanishes at @xmath103 independently of the @xmath104 and each @xmath105 must also vanish on @xmath65 .    since each @xmath106 is a quadric , the first three columns of @xmath72 must consist of linear entries . in particular , the first three columns have entries degree at most one in the @xmath107 .",
    "since the last column contains no @xmath107 , each entry in this column is of degree zero in the @xmath107 .",
    "thus , @xmath102 is at most degree three in the @xmath107 , and each @xmath90 is a cubic .    with the previously defined @xmath90 we will now be able to finish our list of @xmath108 linearly independent cubics which each vanish on @xmath65 .",
    "doing so allows us to define the dixon matrix of four quadrics .",
    "let @xmath109 $ ] each be of degree @xmath89 or less .",
    "we define the @xmath110 of @xmath66 to be a matrix whose @xmath111 row is given by the coefficient vector of @xmath112 where @xmath113 we denote the dixon matrix as @xmath114 . to distinguish between parameters and unknowns",
    "we may notate the dixon matrix as @xmath115 .",
    "note that permuting the order of the unknowns permutes the columns of the dixon matrix , and permuting the order of the @xmath106 s permutes the rows of the dixon matrix .",
    "so up to permutation of rows or columns the dixon matrix is well defined .",
    "but because singularity of a matrix is invariant under permutation of rows or columns then this causes no change in the determinant ( up to scalar constant ) of @xmath116    suppose we are given four quadrics in three unknowns , @xmath117\\ ] ] then the dixon matrix @xmath114 is singular if @xmath118 . the determinant of the dixon matrix vanishes",
    "if there exists a solution to the system .    if @xmath119 then @xmath114 maps @xmath120^t\\ ] ] to zero",
    "this is because the dixon matrix was constructed using coefficient vectors of @xmath121 , so @xmath122 $ ] equals @xmath123^t$ ] .",
    "this is the zero vector when @xmath124 .",
    "so the kernel is non - trivial and the matrix is singular .",
    "the next theorem shows how to use the technique in the case where @xmath125 $ ] are quadrics in four unknowns . to define the dixon matrix of four quadrics in four unknowns we specify three of the unknowns and",
    "consider the fourth as a parameter like @xmath126 .",
    "so the determinant of @xmath127 will be an element of @xmath128 .",

    "the matrix @xmath127 maps a nonzero vector to zero as in the previous theorem .",
    "this means its determinant of @xmath127 must vanish at @xmath135 .",
