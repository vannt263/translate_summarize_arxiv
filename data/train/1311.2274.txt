    "more recently , gravitational lensing has been studied from a strong - field perspective , often using an analytical method pioneered by bozza @xcite to calculate the deflection angle .",

    "@xcite to study two special models by lemos et al .",
    ". gravitational lensing by a @xmath4-field wormhole is discussed in ref .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the existence of dark matter can be deduced from the observed flat rotation curves of neutral hydrogen clouds in the outer regions of the halo .",
    "the neutral hydrogen clouds must therefore be treated as test particles moving in circular orbits .",
    "accordingly , the spacetime in the galactic halo is characterized by the line element @xcite @xmath5 using units in which @xmath6 here @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rotational velocity and @xmath9 is an integration constant .",

    "( [ e : line3 ] ) , this condition is met .",
    "it also follows that the wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the _ shape function _ , @xmath18 , must obey the following conditions at the throat @xmath19 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the so - called flare - out condition .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ e : einstein ] ) implies that @xmath22 must be positive .",

    "@xcite , this is also the radius of the photon sphere .",
    "it remains to determine the value of @xmath82 . from eq .",
    "( [ e : k ] ) , @xmath109 and we may revert to @xmath110 .",
    "we now find that @xmath111",
    "we saw earlier that the throat is the @xmath43-intercept of @xmath45 since , due to the spherical symmetry , @xmath48 is the same function along any outward ray emanating from the origin . in similar manner ,",
    "if a shape function is viewed as a translation to or from the origin along this ray , this would correspond to a horizontal translation in fig .",
    "1 . upon closer examination",
    ", however , such a translation would affect the radius of the throat . but recalling that @xmath18 has the form in eq.([e : form1 ] ) , namely , @xmath112,\\ ] ] a larger @xmath113 will cause the curve to  flatten , \" as shown in fig .",
    "2 . since @xmath114 kpc is     has a negligible effect on the throat size . ]    indeed very large compared to @xmath43 not too far from the origin @xmath65 , the effect of the translation on the throat size is small or even negligible .",
    "suppose that the center of the wormhole is at @xmath115 , the new origin ( fig .",
    "then the throat radius relative to @xmath115     can not be distinguished from a wormhole centered at @xmath115 . ]",
    "is approximately the same as in fig .",
    "so mathematically speaking , @xmath18 has the same properties regardless of the location along the ray .",
    "in other words , mathematically , and hence physically , we can not distinguish between a wormhole centered at @xmath65 from a wormhole centered at @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , the radius of the throat is approximately 0.40 ly for all wormholes in our model , provided , of course , that they exist .",
    "since the radius of the throat corresponds to the radius of the photon sphere , such a sphere would be detectable , thereby providing observational evidence for the existence of the wormhole .    to obtain further evidence",
    ", it would be highly desirable to obtain at least a rough estimate of the radius @xmath74 of the mouth of the wormhole .",
    "here we return to the origin @xmath65 . as noted earlier , the wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat , raising the question of a possible cutoff at @xmath74 and the junction to an external schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "here we are going to assume that even though we are still in the halo region , the exterior solution is close enough to schwarzschild to permit a rough estimate of @xmath74 . to that end",
    "we recall that the mass of the wormhole is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 . using the redshift function in line element ( [ e : line3 ] )",
    ", @xmath118 is determined from the condition @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120     } { a},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is a constant of integration .    before continuing ,",
    "we need to estimate the value of @xmath4 , given the earlier parameters .",
    "since @xmath122 and @xmath54 , we have from the shape function @xmath123\\ ] ] that @xmath124 which leads to @xmath125 .",
    "it follows that @xmath4 can be safely neglected in eq .",
    "( [ e : junction ] ) .    a return to the parameters discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : rho ] now offers some posibilities : suppose we let @xmath126 , the virial radius , and then use @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "these values suggest that we should expect @xmath74 to be in excess of 1 @xmath1 .",
    "evidence for the existence of a mouth can therefore be sought in this range .",
    "it has been suggested that for wormholes in our halo , the large magellanic cloud can be used for applying the gravitational lensing technique , possibly even using past data . for the location of the mouth , we need to recall that according to refs .",
    "@xcite , photons with closest approach greater than the wormhole s mouth have a schwarzschild lensing effect . for both throat and mouth",
    ", these effects can in principle be detected .",
    "+   + _ remark : _ while it is known that the nfw model predicts velocities in the central parts that are too low @xcite , these discrepancies vanish in the more remote regions of the halo @xcite .",
    "given the navarro - frenk - white density profile of halos , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and confirmed in this paper ) that these halos posses some of the characteristics that could give rise to traversable wormholes .",
    "given that @xmath39 is the only allowed value in eq .",
    "( [ e : start ] ) , we also obtained a partial converse : the existence of traversable wormholes helps determine the basic form of the navarro - frenk - white density profile .",
    "the shape function , obtained from this profile , meets the flare - out condition at the throat .",
    "such a throat always exists , but its location can not be determined from the geometry .",
    "however , using a method for calculating the deflection angle pioneered by bozza @xcite , it is shown that the deflection angle diverges at the throat .",
    "the resulting photon sphere has a radius of about 0.40 ly regardless of the location of the wormhole .",
    "detection may be possible using past data . since the dark matter in the halo region does not interact with light , a suitable vehicle would be ordinary light from the large magellanic cloud .",
