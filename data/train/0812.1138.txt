    "it is well known that if @xmath1 is a topological space then its singular simplicial set @xmath0 ( which , in dimension @xmath3 , is just the set of continuous maps from the topological @xmath3-simplex to @xmath1 ) completely captures the weak homotopy type of @xmath1 .",
    "the intuitive argument here is that @xmath0 contains all information about maps from spheres ( of each dimension ) to @xmath1 since spheres can be triangulated , and that it also contains all information about homotopies of such maps since homotopies of spheres can be realized simplicially ( i.e. , @xmath4 can be triangulated ) . as such , homotopy theory",
    "can , if desired , be done in an entirely simplicial way .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 contains no information about the proper ( or locally compact ) structure of @xmath1 : the realization @xmath5 of @xmath0 is almost never locally compact , even if @xmath1 is locally compact ( or even compact ) .",
    "thus if one wants to study the ( weak ) proper homotopy invariants ( e.g. , the borel ",
    "moore singular homology , various analytically obtained invariants ) of a locally compact space @xmath1 , it does not suffice to only consider the simplicial set @xmath0 .",
    "but of course one can develop , e.g. , the locally finitely supported borel ",
    "moore singular homology of a locally compact @xmath1 in a simplicial / singular way , by considering locally finite chains .",
    "( the original approach of borel ",
    "moore  @xcite is sheaf - theoretic in nature .",
    "the approach using locally finite chains is perhaps a bit folkloric , though it has been rigorously exposed in @xcite .",
    ") information about whether or not a collection of singular simplices is ` local finite ' is not contained in @xmath0 ; we solve this problem by replacing the category of sets with a category of _ controlled sets _",
    "( or ` sets with supports ' ) , yielding _ simplicial controlled sets_. in particular , for @xmath1 locally compact , we naturally get a simplicial controlled set @xmath2 .",
    "a feature of our approach is that it simultaneously generalizes the classical ` compactly supported ' case and the proper case : the singular simplicial set @xmath0 can be viewed as a simplicial controlled set @xmath6 with ` minimal control ' ( see remark  [ rmk : top - minctl ] ) , and doing so yields classical results .    after establishing basic definitions and properties , we endeavour to show that @xmath2 really does capture the weak proper homotopy type of a locally compact @xmath1 .",
    "we do not do this in full generality , since doing so would require the development of a large amount of theory , in particular a corresponding category of ` controlled topological spaces ' together with closed symmetric monoidal structures on these categories ( see remark  [ rmk : ctl - real - sing ] ) , but only to the extent that is immediately possible ( but we do give indications as to how to proceed in full generality ) . just as @xmath0 contains all information about maps to @xmath1 from finite simplicial complexes ( a fact which can be expressed by an adjunction ) ,",
    "we show that @xmath2 contains all information about _ proper _ maps to @xmath1 from _ locally finite _ simplicial complexes .",
    "finally , we show how the locally finitely supported borel ",
    "moore singular homology ( and the corresponding cohomology with compact supports ) of @xmath1 can be obtained easily and immediately from @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the exact same process applied to @xmath6 ( which , as indicated above , corresponds to the standard singular simplicial set @xmath0 ) yields the usual singular homology with compact supports ( and its corresponding cohomology ) .    we note that our terminology originates in coarse geometry ; see in particular @xcite ( and also the author s  @xcite ) .",
    "it goes without saying that there are also applications of our work to coarse geometry , even though we do not discuss them here .",
    "we have resisted changing our terminology of ` controlled set ' to the arguably more transparent ` sets with support ' ( or ` supported sets ' ) , since the latter seems to lead to further unwieldy terminology .",
