    "a ratchet accelerator ( ra ) @xcite can generate , without using a biased field , directed transport in both the momentum and coordinate space .",
    "specifically , certain spatio - temporal symmetries in the hamiltonian dynamics are broken and as a result a linearly increasing directed current can be dynamically generated .",
    "such a property of ra systems is of considerable interest for understanding ( i ) general properties of quantum and classical ratchet effects in hamiltonian systems @xcite , ( ii ) quantum - classical correspondence in transport phenomena @xcite , and ( iii ) a number of interesting topics in quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "ongoing cold - atom studies of the well - known quantum kicked - rotor ( qkr ) model @xcite have motivated several ra studies using qkr variants .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that accelerating quantum ratchet current can be realized by considering a qkr variant , with the kicking period on the main resonance with the recoil frequency of the cold atoms .",
    "reference @xcite showed that a quantum ra can also be realized with qkr variants on high - order quantum resonances . in both cases , spatio - temporal symmetries in the dynamics",
    "are broken by using a bichromatic optical lattice ( specifically , an optical super - lattice obtained by superimposing two stand - waves with periods @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . however , though already achieved in some static cases @xcite , experimentally realizing bichromatic and pulsed optical lattices is somewhat demanding .",
    "indeed , in two recent cold - atom on - resonance - qkr experiments @xcite , directed quantum transport is effectively demonstrated by use of a single - period optical lattice only , with the price being that special symmetry - breaking initial superposition states should be prepared .",
    "the ratchet transport in the above - mentioned on - resonance - qkr models @xcite occurs only for isolated values of the effective planck constant ( to be defined below ) .",
    "by contrast , using variants of another paradigm of quantum chaos , namely , the kicked - harper model @xcite , gong and brumer @xcite proposed a quantum ra model that works for an arbitrary value of the effective planck constant . in this sense , the ratchet transport in this new model @xcite is _",
    "generic_. furthermore , this generic ra model works even when the underlying classical dynamics is fully chaotic , a situation where classical ratchet transport necessarily vanishes according to a classical  sum rule \" @xcite .",
    "hence the work in ref .",
    "@xcite represents an interesting and generic quantum violation of a classical theorem .",
    "the detailed aspects of the above - mentioned quantum violation of the classical sum rule are yet to be explored . along this direction ,",
    "a cold - atom realization of a generic quantum ra model would be of great interest .",
    "nevertheless , such experiments were thought to be challenging because the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite also employed a flashing bichromatic optical lattice and it was unclear how a kicked - harper - like model can be realized in a cold - atom laboratory .    thanks to our recent finding @xcite that exposed a direct connection between qkr and a class of kicked - harper - like models , here we are able to propose a quantum ra model that ( i ) contains all the important ingredients as the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) does not require a bichromatic lattice potential , and ( iii ) is realizable by slightly modifying existing cold - atom experiments of qkr dynamics .",
    "indeed , this new ra model only requires an on - resonance variant of qkr , kicked by two optical lattice potentials of the same lattice constant , but with unequal kicking amplitudes and a fixed phase shift between them .",
    "in addition to offering a simpler quantum ra model that is of theoretical interest , it is hoped that our results below will motivate cold - atom experimental studies in the near future .",

    "section v concludes this work .",
    "our starting point is the so - called double kicked - rotor model ( dkrm ) @xcite that has been experimentally realized .",
    "we use scaled and dimensionless variables throughout .",
    "the dkrm hamiltonian is then given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 are conjugate coordinate and momentum operators , @xmath6 is the period for both kicking sequences , @xmath7 is the time delay between the two kicking sequences , @xmath8 and @xmath9 characterize the amplitudes of the kicking fields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are periodic functions of @xmath3 with the period @xmath12 .",
    "the associated quantum map @xmath13 for a period from @xmath14 to @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents an effective and dimensionless planck constant for the dkrm system ( hence @xmath18 ) .",
    "theoretically , we shall first focus on an ideal situation where cold atoms are injected with exactly zero quasi - momentum @xcite . with that simplification",
    "we may consider only a hilbert space satisfying the periodic boundary condition associated with @xmath19 .",
    "the quantum resonance condition @xmath20 then leads to @xmath21 reducing @xmath13 to @xmath22 , @xmath23 where we have defined the rescaled momentum @xmath24 and the rescaled kicking amplitudes @xmath25 due to the above momentum rescaling , the effective planck constant now becomes @xmath26    equations ( [ kvalue],[lvalue],[etahbar ] ) show that the rescaled dimensionless system parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 can be easily tuned by adjusting the time delay between the two kicking sequences . based on a previous dkrm experiment @xcite , we estimate that in experiments the kicking amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 can vary in the range of @xmath30 , and the effective planck constant @xmath29 can at least vary in the range of @xmath31 .",

    "such a choice under the restriction @xmath48 was adopted by the original experiment @xcite and previous theoretical studies of off - resonance dkrm @xcite .",
    "substituting @xmath47 into eq .",
    "( [ chamiltonian ] ) , the resulting ",
    "@xmath7-classical \" hamiltonian becomes precisely the classical kicked harper model in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "( [ ur ] ) in the case of @xmath47 can be regarded as a quantized version of the twisted kicked harper model .",

    "( [ chamiltonian ] ) . clearly then , at least for a twisted version , a cold - atom quantum version of the bichromatic generalized kicked harper model",
    "@xmath58 is realizable , provided that a kicking bichromatic lattice potential such as @xmath59\\sum_n\\delta(t - n)$ ] can be realized . in the next section a simpler realization of quantum ra",
    "is obtained .    before ending this section",
    "we make one important remark . in the standard kicked harper model @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ sckh ] ) , the momentum variable is an _ abstract _",
    "canonical variable .",
    "this becomes obvious if we consider the canonical equations of motion , yielding that the moving speed in the coordinate space is not proportional to the momentum .",
    "as such , it is unclear whether the momentum variable in the kicked harper model can be directly related to the mechanical momentum of a moving particle .",
    "dana managed to connect this abstract momentum variable with the mechanical momentum of a charged particle kicked by a special sequence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "here , through the cold - atom realization of a wide class of twisted kicked harper models , we are linking the momentum variable in the kicked harper model with the mechanical momentum of cold atoms . only through such connections",
    "can the expectation value of the momentum be interpreted as a current of moving particles .",
    "our discussions in the previous section make it clear that , in realizing a wide class of kicked - harper - like models with on - resonance dkrm , the following canonical transformation or twist is necessarily involved : @xmath60 due to this phase space twist , the resultant systems should assume different symmetry properties than those analyzed in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the symmetry - breaking considerations in ref . @xcite no longer apply to twisted kicked - harper - like models . as a result ,",
    "the use of a bichromatic optical lattice as in ref . @xcite may not be the simplest approach for symmetry - breaking .",
    "it is this recognition that motivated us to seek a realization of a quantum ra without using a bichromatic lattice potential .",
    "this attempt is also consistent with a recent study of ratchet transport ( in coordinate space only ) using an off - resonance dkrm involving two optical lattices of the same lattice constant @xcite .",
    "specifically , here we shall demonstrate that an on - resonance dkrm with the following alternative scenario , @xmath62 can already give rise to a simple quantum ra model if @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to the on - resonance condition , this scenario only needs to introduce two small modifications to a previous dkrm experiment @xcite .",
    "first , the two kicking sequences of optical lattice potentials should have different amplitudes .",
    "second , there should be a fixed phase shift @xmath64 between these two optical lattice potentials .    using eq .",
    "( [ ur ] ) , scenario ii described above gives the following quantum map , @xmath65 using eq .",
    "( [ chamiltonian ] ) , one then obtains the @xmath7-classical hamiltonian of this quantum map ,",
    "@xmath66    let @xmath67 be the eigenstates of the momentum operator @xmath68 , with an eigenvalue @xmath69 for a hilbert space with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "in the following we shall focus on the ra dynamics for the initial state @xmath70 . the classical analog of this initial state is a classical ensemble with @xmath71 and a random uniform distribution of @xmath43 .",
    "such an initial state is a trivial state because it is symmetric upon time - reversal operations or space - reflection operations . with this choice of the initial state ,",
    "any induced current afterwards must be due to some broken spatio - temporal symmetries in the ensuing dynamics .",
    "it is also worth noting that the system described by eq .",
    "( [ ura ] ) is invariant under the transformations @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as a result",
    "the current should undergo a sign change under @xmath74 , leading to the expectation that the generation of a ratchet current is forbidden for @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "for this reason we focus on other values of @xmath64 .",
    "consider first a few computational examples depicted in fig .",
    "1 . there , the time dependence of the quantum ratchet current , i.e. , the expectation value of the scaled momentum , @xmath77 , is shown for some particular values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath70 and the time propagation due to the quantum map @xmath78 is carried out by standard fast - fourier - transformation techniques .",
    "the cases shown in fig .",
    "1 display spectacular linear acceleration of the ratchet current at a significant rate . in order to have a comparison with the underlying @xmath7-classical limit",
    ", we have also calculated the ensemble - averaged classical momentum , @xmath79 .",
    "the classical calculations are based on the @xmath7-classical map given by eq .",
    "( [ rachamiltonian ] ) , using an ensemble of @xmath80 particles initially distributed along @xmath81 randomly and uniformly . as is seen from fig .",
    "1a , the @xmath7-classical currents can also increase linearly , with a slope smaller than their quantum counterparts .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "1b is even more interesting . there",
    "the classical current remains indistinguishable from zero at all times , but the quantum acceleration is substantial .",
    "note also that these  @xmath7-classical \" results have nothing to do with the true classical limit of a dkrm , because here the dkrm is always on the main quantum resonance .",
    "indeed , the @xmath7-classical hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ rachamiltonian ] ) , whereas the true classical hamiltonian of the dkrm should take exactly the same form as eq .",
    "we have also checked that if we choose @xmath82 instead , then both the classical and quantum acceleration seen in the examples in fig .",
    "1a do vanish .",
    "this confirms our previous discussion on a symmetry property of our new ra model .      to further explore the dynamical aspects of our new ra model , we have carried out detailed studies of how the ratchet acceleration rate depends on the system parameters .",
    "the computational examples shown in fig . 1 motivate us to define the quantum current accelerate rate as follows : @xmath83 for the sake of comparison we also define the @xmath7-classical current acceleration rate as @xmath84 computationally , these rates are determined as the average linear increase rate over the time range @xmath85 .",
    "once the linear acceleration rates are obtained , we then check , in many cases , to see if the dynamics over a much longer time scale still accelerates the current with the same rate .",
    "most often this is indeed the case , but some negative cases due to transient effects will be mentioned below .",
    "figure 2 shows the contour plots of @xmath86 and @xmath87 thus obtained as a function of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "a number of interesting features can be observed from fig .",
    "2 . first , significant classical ratchet acceleration ( see fig .",
    "2a ) exists only for those parameter regimes close to the @xmath27 axis or the @xmath28 axis .",
    "that is , at least one of the two values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be small for a considerable classical ratchet acceleration to emerge .",
    "but even that condition does not suffice .",
    "it is also clear from fig . 2a",
    "that the regime of @xmath90 should be excluded in order to have an appreciable @xmath87 .",
    "the overall result is that in the parameter space defined by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , only a very small portion can yield considerable ratchet acceleration in the @xmath7-classical limit .",
    "second , the quantum results shown in fig .",
    "2b-2d display many interest patterns .",
    "these patterns are absent in the classical case shown in fig .",
    "2a , and they vary strongly if we change @xmath91 from an irrational value to a rational value .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "2b-2d that appreciable quantum ratchet acceleration occurs in a much larger parameter regime , often with @xmath92 .",
    "third , the quantum results share one feature with the classical result .",
    "that is , along the direction of @xmath48 , @xmath93 is also seen to be small ( typically much smaller than @xmath94 ) .",
    "some exceptions seem to be captured by fig .",
    "2b , where @xmath86 can become larger than @xmath94 along the direction @xmath48 . however , upon a careful investigation , we find that these exceptions are mainly caused by the particular way we numerically determine @xmath95 . indeed , if we follow the dynamics much longer ( e.g. @xmath96 kicks ) , then the ratchet current tends to saturate for these exceptional cases , in contrast to the unbounded linear acceleration observed in other cases with @xmath97 .",
    "detailed investigations of such transient effects in the ratchet acceleration are beyond the scope this work .",
    "the exact boundary between bounded and unbounded quantum current acceleration can be an interesting and challenging mathematical problem .    to shed more light on the results in fig .",
    "2 , let us examine in fig .",
    "3 the phase space structures of the @xmath7-classical limit of our ra model .",
    "the phase space structure of the entire phase space is just an infinite repetition ( in both @xmath98 and @xmath53 ) of what is shown in fig .",
    "if @xmath99 and either @xmath27 or @xmath28 is sufficiently small , then we always find phase space invariant curves extended in momentum .",
    "trajectories moving along these invariant curves will display ballistic - like diffusion .",
    "such a phase space feature differs from that of the standard kicked harper model . in the latter case",
    "the phase space invariant curves can lie parallel to the @xmath43-axis if @xmath100 .",
    "this difference is expected , because the @xmath7-classical hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ rachamiltonian ] ) is a _ twisted _ version of the kicked harper model .",
    "taking into account that @xmath101 are equivalent points in the phase space , one can easily see that in both cases of fig .",
    "3a and fig .",
    "3b , there exist two bundles of phase space invariant curves , separated by a seperatrix structure associated with some unstable fixed points .",
    "remarkably , the moving directions of the trajectories on the two bundles are opposite to each other .",
    "this feature is also consistent with the classical sum rule @xcite .",
    "based on these observations we are ready to explain the origin of the classical accelerating ratchet current . in particular , because the overlap of the @xmath102 line ( the initial classical ensemble ) with the two bundles of ballistic diffusion curves can be different , the effects of the two bundles of invariant curves can not cancel out against each other and hence a net current develops .",
    "the current will increase linearly with time due to the ballistic nature of the phase space invariant curves extended in momentum .",
    "this understanding is found to be consistent with an estimate using the intersection lengths between the @xmath103 line and the two bundles of phase space invariant curves .",
    "this also clarifies the role of the parameter @xmath64 . as is evident from the expression of the @xmath7-classical hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ rachamiltonian ] ) , the net effect of the parameter @xmath64 is a shift of the phase space structure along the @xmath36-axis .",
    "so the parameter @xmath64 can be used to tune the unbalanced overlap of the initial ensemble with the two bundles of phase space invariant curves .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "3c ) , then before full chaos sets in , a web of separatrices emerge in the phase space and there are no longer phase space invariant curves extended in momentum . as the value of @xmath104 increases , the chaotic layer associated with the web of separatrices becomes thicker and thicker . during this regular - to - chaos transition no phase space invariant curves extended in momentum will emerge . as a result , so long as @xmath104 , ballistic - like diffusion can not happen and a linear acceleration of the ratchet current becomes impossible .",
    "this directly explains why the case of @xmath105 is so special for the @xmath7-classical ratchet acceleration .",
    "figure 2 also shows the absence of significant quantum ratchet acceleration in cases of @xmath104 .",
    "we believe that this quantum result is also due to the special classical phase space structure for @xmath104 .",
    "let us finally discuss the fully chaotic cases .",
    "one typical example is shown in fig .",
    "analogous behavior can be found for other larger values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . clearly , phase space invariant curves are all broken in these fully chaotic cases . as a result ,",
    "classical ratchet acceleration necessarily vanishes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b . this rationalizes the main message from fig .",
    "2a , i.e. , appreciable classical ratchet acceleration exists only for a small fraction of the parameter space of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , in general full classical chaos does not forbid quantum ratchet acceleration .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2b for a generic value of @xmath29 ( i.e. , irrational with @xmath106 ) , large @xmath86 can be found for relatively large @xmath27 and @xmath28 , even when the associated @xmath7-classical dynamics becomes fully chaotic .",
    "a specific computational example has been shown in fig .",
    "this hence confirms a similar observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite and constitutes another example of generic quantum violation of the classical sum rule @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this violation was explained in terms of the concentration of quantum amplitudes on the remanents of classical cantori - like phase space structures extended in momentum . here , as @xmath27 and @xmath28 increase , the two bundles of phase space invariant curves will also generate classical cantori - like structures .",
    "it can then expected that the classical cantori - like structures should be extended in the momentum space for @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 .",
    "as such , the condition for quantum ratchet acceleration to occur in our new model should differ from that in ref .",
    "specifically , it is unnecessary to have a sufficiently large ratio @xmath109 : a sufficiently small ratio @xmath109 should also do . given this understanding , the quantum ratchet acceleration here with full classical chaos",
    "is expected to display a  dual \" symmetry in the @xmath110 space .",
    "this is indeed the case : the pattern in fig .",
    "2b is symmetric along the line of @xmath48 .",
    "note also that for non - generic values of @xmath91 , the quantum ratchet acceleration rates as shown in fig .",
    "2c and fig .",
    "2d can be even larger , despite the fully chaotic phase space in the underlying @xmath7-classical limit .      focusing on the quantum case ,",
    "here we first examine the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath111 . as already indicated by the drastic differences between fig .",
    "2c , and fig .",
    "2d , one might wonder if @xmath95 is too sensitive to @xmath111 such that experimental uncertainties in @xmath111 may kill the ratchet acceleration altogether . to address this concern",
    "we show two typical computational results in fig .",
    "4a for two values of @xmath64 . in both cases",
    "some sharp peaks of @xmath95 can be seen .",
    "these peaks are located at those values of @xmath111 that are rational multiples of @xmath106 .",
    "nevertheless , the overall @xmath112-dependence of @xmath95 does not show drastic oscillations .",
    "they can be varying smoothly over a considerably wide range of @xmath29 .",
    "this feature also resembles what is found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the regime of very small @xmath112",
    ", we have checked that @xmath95 does approach the @xmath7-classical acceleration rate @xmath113 , thus establishing the expected quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath95 shown here is a purely quantum effect . to have a theory accounting for this @xmath29-dependence would be challenging but truly fascinating .",
    "a related question is whether or not the ratchet acceleration is robust to variations in the parameter @xmath64 that characterizes the phase lag between two optical lattices of the same lattice constant . as demonstrated by the example shown in fig .",
    "4b , the @xmath64-dependence of @xmath95 is smooth in the entire range of @xmath64 .",
    "this is somewhat expected : in the @xmath7-classical limit the parameter @xmath64 only shifts the phase space structure along the momentum axis .",
    "the conclusion is that small fluctuations in @xmath64 or @xmath112 should not be a big concern for experimental studies .      in cold - atom experiments of kicked - rotor systems ,",
    "the initial state can not be exactly the state with zero quasi - momentum , even when the atoms are injected by a large - size bose - einstein condensate . indeed , cold atoms are moving in real space , so",
    "their matter - wave state does not need to satisfy the periodic boundary condition inherent to a true kicked - rotor system . to motivate cold - atom experimental studies of our new ra model",
    ", it becomes necessary to examine the detrimental effects of the nonzero quasi - momentum spread in the initial state .",
    "because the kicking optical lattice potentials are always periodic , the quasi - momentum of the cold atoms , denoted @xmath114 , is a conserved quantity @xcite .",
    "the dynamics emanated from an initial state with a spread in @xmath114 can then be easily simulated by considering each @xmath114-component separately . to shed more light on this issue",
    "let us return to the dkrm propagator @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) . for each @xmath114 component ,",
    "one now has @xmath115 .",
    "this leads to the consequence that @xmath116 under the quantum resonance condition @xmath20 . nevertheless , for @xmath20 and for the potentials @xmath117 and @xmath118 used in our ra model , it is enlightening to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) as @xmath119 except for the first factor , this expression is completely parallel to @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ ura ] ) .",
    "because the first factor is no longer unity and changes with @xmath114 , the first factor introduces de - phasing when a distribution of @xmath114 values are averaged over .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the @xmath114 spread will tend to saturate the accelerating ratchet current .    below we assume a gaussian distribution of @xmath114 , with the variance denoted by @xmath120 and the mean value denoted by @xmath121 .",
    "results for a typical case are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen from fig . 5a",
    "that a nonzero variance @xmath120 indeed induces the saturation of the quantum ratchet current .",
    "the exact saturation time increases , but slowly , with decreasing @xmath120 . for the parameters adopted in fig .",
    "5a , the typical saturation time is around 20 kicking periods for @xmath122 ( scaled by @xmath29 ) , a characteristic value of the @xmath114 spread reported in a recent experiment using bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "figure 5b also shows an interesting dependence of the ratchet current at @xmath123 upon the mean quasi - momentum @xmath121 of the initial state . the result for @xmath124",
    "is seen to be almost the same as that for @xmath125 .",
    "this @xmath121-dependence of the ratchet current at early times might be of interest to experimental studies as well .    in future experiments",
    "the quasi - momentum spread can be made smaller than @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "however , the result in fig .",
    "5a indicates that even for @xmath127 , the saturation still sets in within a relatively short time scale .",
    "interestingly , a previous theoretical ra model using a bichromatic optical lattice displays saturation at a similar time scale @xcite .",
    "this indicates that when faced with the detrimental effects of the quasi - momentum spread , the robustness of our new ra model without a bichromatic optical lattice is similar to previous models with bichromatic optical lattices .",
    "so far we have studied the ratchet transport in the dkrm under the main quantum resonance condition @xmath20 . to motivate both theoretical and experimental studies in the future ,",
    "in this short section we briefly discuss an interesting extension of the current study .",
    "the extension is about the dynamics of ratchet current acceleration in dkrm on high - order quantum resonances . in such extended cases , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are two incommensurate integers . under this high - order quantum resonance condition",
    "we find that analogous ratchet acceleration can be obtained as well , without using a bichromatic optical lattice .",
    "thus , ratchet current acceleration itself may provide a useful tool for studies of high - order quantum resonances in dkrm .    as an example in fig .",
    "6 we show @xmath86 under the quantum anti - resonance condition @xmath131 , as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the kicking potentials @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the same as those considered in figs . 1 - 5 . the case in fig .",
    "6a represents cases with a generic value of @xmath29 , yielding appreciable @xmath86 in some regimes . in this case the detailed dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath27 and @xmath28 is seen to be rather complicated .",
    "the case of @xmath132 in fig .",
    "6b represents cases with nongeneric values of @xmath29 .",
    "the associated ratchet acceleration effect is seen to be larger over a wider regime .",
    "the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath27 and @xmath28 is also simpler than that seen in fig .",
    "these results have no apparent connections with classical ratchet transport , in the sense that for high - order quantum resonances we can no longer define an @xmath7-classical limit to guide our qualitative understandings .",
    "however , as is evident from fig .",
    "6 , even in these quantum anti - resonance dkrm cases , a significant ratchet acceleration rate also requires the condition @xmath133 .",
    "more studies of this extension will be carried out in the near future .",
    "to conclude , we have proposed and studied a new quantum ratchet accelerator model based on atom optics realizations of kicked - rotor systems . unlike all previous ratchet accelerator models , here we do not need to use a bichromatic optical lattice potential .",
    "based on this advantage and the detailed computational studies presented here , we believe that the cold - atom realization of our ratchet accelerator model is within the reach of today s state - of - the - art experiments @xcite .",
    "indeed , the avenue of using atom optics to experimentally study a whole class of kicked - harper - like models has been just opened up @xcite , and the ratchet accelerator model proposed here seems to be a wonderful starting point along this direction .    to have a linear acceleration of ratchet current in the @xmath7-classical limit of our model",
    ", we have shown that the phase space invariant curves extended in the momentum space are a necessary condition .",
    "therefore , for kicking optical lattice potentials @xmath134 and @xmath135 , an on - resonance double - kicked rotor with equal kicking amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath9 can not yield an unbounded and linearly increasing classical current .",
    "instead , we need unequal kicking amplitudes for accelerating and unbounded classical current to occur .",
    "this interesting requirement is also observed , but not fully explained , in the quantum dynamics . given unequal kicking amplitudes , the quantum ratchet acceleration in our model can however persist for large kicking amplitudes , even when the @xmath7-classical limit no longer has phase space invariant curves extended in the momentum space .",
    "this purely quantum effect is believed to be another example that remanents of classical phase space structures can dramatically impact the quantum dynamics .",
    "considering these insights , we hope that our simple ratchet accelerator model will also motivate future theoretical work to better understand quantum transport and quantum - classical correspondence in classically chaotic systems .",
