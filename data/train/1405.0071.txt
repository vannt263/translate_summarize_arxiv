    "the top quark , with a mass of @xmath1  gev  @xcite , is the most massive of the elementary particles of the standard model ( sm ) . in proton - antiproton collisions ,",
    "top quarks can be produced singly through electroweak interactions and this process provides a unique opportunity to test the standard model and search for non - sm physics .    in the sm , the single - top - quark production cross section is predicted to be proportional to the square of the magnitude of the quark - mixing cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix  @xcite element @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , measurements of the single - top - quark production rate could be sensitive to contributions from a fourth generation of quarks  @xcite .",
    "the two dominant production modes of the single - top - quark process are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman_diagrams ] and are sensitive to different classes of sm extensions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-channel process  @xcite , in which an intermediate @xmath3 boson decays into a top ( antitop ) quark and an antibottom ( bottom ) quark , is sensitive to contributions from additional heavy bosons  @xcite ; the @xmath4-channel process  @xcite , in which a bottom quark transforms into a top quark by exchanging a @xmath3 boson with another quark , is more sensitive to flavor - changing neutral currents  @xcite . independently studying the production rate of these channels provides more restrictive constraints on sm extensions than just studying the combined production rate .",
    "-channel and ( b ) @xmath4-channel single - top - quark production at the tevatron.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    single - top - quark production was first observed independently by the cdf and d0 experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these results were based on an inclusive search targeting the combined contribution of @xmath0-channel and @xmath4-channel production .",
    "several differences in @xmath0- and @xmath4-channel event properties can be used to distinguish them from one another .",
    "for example , events originating from @xmath4-channel production typically contain one light - flavor jet in the forward detector region ( at large pseudorapidity ) .",
    "the direction of this jet ( whether it is along the proton or anti - proton direction ) is also correlated with the charge of the lepton .",
    "these properties are very powerful for distinguishing them from events associated with @xmath0-channel production and other sm background processes .",
    "moreover , events from the @xmath0-channel process are more likely to contain two jets which can be identified as originating from @xmath5 quarks ( @xmath5 jets ) . hence , single - top - like events with two identified @xmath5 jets are more likely to have originated from @xmath0-channel production .",
    "the @xmath4-channel single - top quark production was first observed in 2011 by the d0 experiment  @xcite , and later confirmed in 2012 by the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc  @xcite . the @xmath0-channel process has not yet been observed . because of the smaller production cross section and larger backgrounds , it is more difficult to isolate it compared to the @xmath4-channel process in proton - antiproton collisions .",
    "it is even more difficult at the lhc , as proton - proton collisions yield a significantly smaller signal - to - background ratio compared to the tevatron .",
    "in fact , to date the lhc experiments have only reported unpublished upper limits on the cross section .",
    "since the magnitude of the @xmath3-top - bottom quark coupling is much larger than the @xmath3-top - down and @xmath3-top - strange quark couplings , each top quark is assumed to decay exclusively into a @xmath3  boson and a @xmath5 quark .",
    "we seek events in which the @xmath3 boson decays leptonically ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "online event selection is based on identifying an isolated high-@xmath7 lepton or a large imbalance of transverse energy .",
    "the offline event selection is split into two distinct topologies , both designed to select single - top - quark events in which the @xmath3  boson decays leptonically .",
    "one final - state topology ( ) , analyzed by both the cdf and d0 collaborations , contains single - top - quark events in which the charged lepton from the @xmath3  boson decay is identified .",
    "events are selected with an identified electron or muon , two or more jets , and .",
    "at least one of the jets must be identified as a @xmath5 jet  @xcite .",
    "additional selection criteria are applied to exclude kinematic regions that are difficult to model , and to minimize the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) multijet background .",
    "the other final - state topology , analyzed by the cdf collaboration , involves  and jets , the event selection is similar to , but no reconstructed isolated charged leptons are allowed in the event(+jets ) .",
    "this additional sample increases the acceptance for @xmath0-channel signal events by encompassing those in which the @xmath3-boson decay produces a muon or electron that is either not reconstructed or not isolated , or a hadronically decaying tau lepton that is reconstructed as a third jet . in order to reduce the large multijet background in this channel , a neural - network event selection is optimized to preferentially select signal - like events .",
    "events passing the and + jets selections are further separated into independent analysis channels based on the number of reconstructed jets as well as the number and quality of @xmath5-tagged jets .",
    "each of the analyzed channels has a different background composition and signal ( @xmath0 ) to background ( @xmath5 ) ratio . analyzing them",
    "separately enhances the sensitivity to single - top - quark production .",
    "both collaborations use monte carlo  ( mc ) generators to simulate the kinematic properties of signal and background events , except in the case of multijet production , for which the model is derived from data .",
    "single - top - quark signal events are modeled with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) accuracy in the strong coupling constant @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "kinematic properties of background events associated with the @xmath3+jets and @xmath9+jets processes are simulated using a leading - order mc generator  @xcite , and those of diboson processes ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and are modeled using mc  @xcite . in all cases is used to model proton remnants and simulate the hadronization of all generated partons .",
    "all mc events are processed through -based detector simulations  @xcite .",
    "predictions for the normalization of simulated background - process contributions are estimated using both simulation and data .",
    "data are used to normalize the @xmath3 plus light - flavor and heavy - flavor jet contributions using enriched @xmath3+jets data samples that have negligible signal .",
    "all other simulated background samples are normalized to the theoretical cross sections at nlo combined with next - to - next - to - leading log ( nnll ) resummation  @xcite for @xmath4-channel single - top - quark production , at next - to - nlo  @xcite for , at nlo  @xcite for @xmath9+jets and diboson production , and including all relevant higher - order qcd and electroweak corrections for higgs - boson production  @xcite . differences observed between simulated events and data in lepton and jet reconstruction efficiencies , resolutions , jet - energy scale ( jes ) , and @xmath5-tagging efficiencies are adjusted in the simulation to match the data , through correction functions obtained from measurements in independent data samples .",
    "d0 has optimized the single top analysis from ref .",
    "@xcite to enhance the sensitivity to the @xmath0-channel in the @xmath13 final state , and has improved the selection by employing a newer more efficient @xmath5-tagging algorithm . in the new analysis  @xcite the events",
    "are split into four independent channels depending on the jet multiplicity and the number of @xmath5-tagged jets .",
    "three multivariate methods are applied to the selected data : boosted decision trees ( bdt ) , bayesian neural networks ( bnn ) , and matrix element probability calculations ( me ) .",
    "they are optimized to measure the @xmath0 and the @xmath4 channels separately in all four analysis channels .",
    "the bdt method uses up to 30 kinematic variables , the bnn uses the objects four momenta with a few other variables such as the @xmath5-tag output of jets , @xmath14(light jet ) , and the invariant @xmath3  boson mass , and the me uses the objects four vectors .",
    "the three methods are not fully correlated ( @xmath15 ) and their discriminant outputs are therefore combined by a second bnn which gives a better expected sensitivity than any individual method .",
    "one of the most important improvements in this analysis is the development of a new method to measure the @xmath0- and the @xmath4-channels independently , without assuming the sm @xmath16 ratio when calculating the @xmath17 cross section .",
    "this flexible analysis is used for all of the d0 results discussed below .",
    "the cdf results discussed below are based on four different analyses . in an analysis from a few years ago  @xcite ,",
    "a nn is used to make single top quark measurements in the @xmath18 sample .",
    "events with two or three jets and one or two @xmath5 tags are considered . in the category with two tags and two @xmath5 jets ,",
    "the nn is optimized for @xmath0 channel , while in the other three categories the nn is optimized for @xmath4 channel events .",
    "more recently , an analysis has been optimized for @xmath0 channel in all categories  @xcite of the lepton plus two jet sample .",
    "the analysis is based on the sm higgs boson search  @xcite , which shares the same final state : @xmath19 .",
    "there are three lepton categories : central tight electrons , central tight muons , and extended muons ( loose muons and isolated track lepton - candidates ) .",
    "the identification of @xmath5 jets has also improved with respect to previous searches  @xcite .",
    "the selection requires exactly two jets , at least one of which is required to be @xmath5-tagged . the analysis is then split in four channels according to the different @xmath5-tagged properties of the jets .",
    "one operational point ( denoted t for tight ) has 42% @xmath5-jet efficiency and 0.9% mistag rate , and a second operational point ( denoted l for loose ) has 70% @xmath5-jet efficiency and 9% misidentification rate per jet .",
    "events are therefore split according to the four orthogonal categories : tt , tl , t , and ll .",
    "this improves the sensitivity of the analysis by separating regions of the phase space with different signal - to - background ratios .",
    "cdf also has two analyses based on the + jets topology : one for the combined @xmath17 analysis  @xcite , and one that is optimized for the @xmath0 channel  @xcite .",

    "a binned likelihood technique using the multivariate discriminant shapes is employed in order to extract the most likely value for the cross section measurement .",
    "the most recent measurements of the combined @xmath0-channel plus @xmath4-channel cross section measurements from the tevatron are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_plus_t_summary ] .",
