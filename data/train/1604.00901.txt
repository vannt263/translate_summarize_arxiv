    "if a large mass , such as a galaxy , is located between a source of radiation and observer , it will bend the trajectories of the photons and distort the observed image .",
    "in particular it can lead to the occurrence of multiple images of the same source . in such cases",
    ", the radiation that is emitted at the same time from the source will travel along different paths . as a consequence , in the case of time variable sources",
    ", the observer will record the same variability pattern from the various images , but with a time delay dependent on the geometry of the source - lens - observer system .",
    "this effect due to the mass distribution of the whole galaxy , is referred to as macrolensing , and may be accompanied by additional effects due to individual stars in the lensing galaxy i.e. microlensing .",
    "the latter affects the images on much smaller angular scales , not observable with imaging instruments .    however , the deflection of the photon s trajectories results in changes of the magnification that can be observed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the microlensing is sensitive to small changes in the size and the location of the emission region .",
    "thus , it can be used to find and study the morphology of sources well beyond the reach of the angular resolution of even radio instruments .",
    "this technique is suitable for search of e.g. dark matter clumps ( see e.g. @xcite ) and extrasolar planets ( see e.g. @xcite ) . recently , microlensing was used to explain the time variability properties displayed in the hundred mev - gev band by the known gravitationally - lensed blazars pks1830 - 211 @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these authors show that the changes in the magnification ratio of the leading and trailing component are consistent with microlensing due to individual stars in the lensing galaxy , as long as the emission region is relatively small , @xmath0 cm , and the relative speed of the source and the microlens is of the order of @xmath1km / s .",
    "those results are however at odds with the standard paradigm of blazars , where the high - energy emission is generated in compact regions moving with relativistic velocities along the jet .",
    "relativistic velocities are needed to explain the observed properties of blazars , such as high luminosity during flares , fast intrinsic variability , and indirectly also the lack of strong absorption of tev gamma rays .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether the observed changes in the relative gamma - ray magnification of both components can be explained by microlensing on larger structures than stars .",
    "the size of those objects would result in much larger regions in the source plane being magnified by a single microlensing event , than for the case of microlensing on individual stars .",
    "therefore , microlensing on such intermediate size objects , if plausible , can relax the strong constraints on the size of the gamma - ray emission region and its velocity .",
    "we study following classes of objects acting as possible lenses for such a process : ocs , gcs and gmcs .",
    "we focus on the interpretation of the changes in the magnification pattern of the 2012 high state of . in section  [ sec : src ] we introduce the blazar . in section  [ sec : microlens ] we estimate how probable the microlensing is on various intermediate scale structures . using the inverted ray shooting method",

    "gc and oc , radiation pressure and supernova explosions drive the gas away from the cluster . emission of sources with sizes up to @xmath27 pc can be magnified via microlensing on a gc or an oc .",
    "let us now estimate how probable a lensing event is by computing the microlensing optical depth @xmath28 .",

    ", one has to correct the distance scale of @xmath39 by a factor of @xmath40 to take into account that  is more compact than the milky way .",

    "similarly we can compute the optical depth for an oc seen face - on , assuming @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the radius of the galactic disk where the ocs are present ,    @xmath46    however , if the same lens is seen edge - on the area covered by ocs is much smaller .",
    "it can be computed as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the maximum height of the disk up to which the ocs are observed ,    @xmath49    due to the projection effect , the lensing on ocs would be much more probable if the lensing galaxy itself is seen edge - on .",

    "the optical depth values are rather low making the lensing on gcs and ocs not very probable except for galaxies with a greater abundance of star clusters .",
    "gmcs are large gas structures where intense star formation occurs .",
    "they typically have masses of the order of @xmath50 and radii @xmath51pc @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a large spread in both of those parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gmc have complicated structures , with filaments , clumps and cores ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "there are over @xmath52 gmcs in the milky way , with @xmath1 of them having masses above @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "since gmcs are much more irregular than star clusters , microlensing can occur on smaller scales ( clumps ) within them .",
    "we can compute roughly the optical depth for a source being microlensed at a given moment by a clump in a gmc : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the number and mass of clumps in a typical gmc and @xmath57 .",
    "based on the h@xmath58 distribution in the galaxy , estimated with co measurements @xcite , and rescaling them for the different sizes of  and the galaxy , the inhomogeneity factor @xmath59 is expected to be of the order of 1 for the a image , and of the order of 10 for the b image .",
    "moreover , as the projected position of the lensed source traverses the gmc , it can cross multiple individual clumps on time scales of months .",
    "therefore , the probability for the image of a lensed source to cross a gmc , and thus being periodically magnified via microlensing on individual clumps , scales with the projected area of the gmcs .",
    "it is a factor @xmath60 larger then the value obtained in eq .",

    "in fact , there are reasons to believe that at least one of the images of  crosses a gmc in the lensing galaxy . @xcite interpreted the different reddening of the two images of  as an additional absorption of the leading image with the differential extinction @xmath61 .",
    "the absorption is so strong , that it inverts the brightness ratio of the two images in the optical range , making the trailing image brighter .",
    "moreover , molecular absorption line has been detected in the leading image , allowing the estimation of the h@xmath58 column density , which is a rather large value of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a similarly large column of absorbing gas has been also detected in the other known gravitationally lensed gamma - ray quasar pks1830 - 211 @xcite , for which microlensing was suggested @xcite .",
    "in this section we use numerical simulations to compute the magnification maps caused by microlensing on intermediate scale structures .",
    "we use the inverse ray shooting method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we project a large number of points homogeneously on the lens plane and compute their corresponding position in the source plane .",
    "to compute the deflection angles of individual rays we use the typical thin sheath approximation of the lens , i.e. we project the 3d distribution of the mass on the xy plane of the lens .",
    "then , we divide the source plane in a grid of cells and compute the magnification as the ratio of the number of rays hitting a given cell to the average number of rays emitted in the solid angle of this cell .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the computed multiplications is @xmath63 .",
    "the resolution of the maps is defined as the linear size of the cells in which the magnification is computed . for larger sources ,",
    "the magnification would average over multiple cells of the map , resulting in smaller values for sharp features .",
    "we simulate a gc with the total mass of @xmath64 composed of individual stars with masses of @xmath65 .",
    "the stars are distributed according to eq .",
    "note that as the number of stars is large , and we are interested in the lensing on the whole structure of gc rather than on the individual stars the precise distribution of the star masses is not relevant for this study .",
    "we select @xmath66pc and @xmath67pc ( corresponding to @xmath68pc ) as a typical gc parameters .",
    "the shadowing of individual rays by the stars is negligible , therefore the stars are treated as point masses . in fig .",

    "values of the order of 10 occur if the projection of the emission region crosses the core . for a source with an emission region below @xmath69pc , magnifications up to a factor of 100",
    "are achieved at the centre of the gc .",
    "ocs are less abundant in stars than gcs .",

    "if the gamma - ray emission of  is emitted according to the classical blob - in - jet models , it would be likely accompanied by a superluminal motion of the emission region .",

    "such possibility is further supported by clearly different gev gamma - ray spectral shape in both cases @xcite and by a different type of activity ( multiple flares in 2012 versus a single flare in 2014 ) . in the case of flat spectrum radio quasars",
    ", the gamma - ray emission can be easily generated up to @xmath93pc along the jet .",
    "assuming that the jet is visible at an angle of @xmath94 , this corresponds to a distance ( measured in the frame of the lens ) of @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , in this scenario it is still expected that the microlensing magnification pattern does not change significantly for different flaring periods .",

    "therefore , the comparison of the evolution of the relative magnification ratio between different flaring periods might be another discriminant in the long standing problem of the location of the emission region in the fsrqs . finally , @xcite interpreted the difference in the time delay of the two images in the radio and in gamma rays as a difference in the projected distance of the radio core and the high energy emission region to be @xmath96pc .",
    "if the location of the gamma - ray emission region can vary by a fraction of this number ( which might be difficult taking into account the available radiation fields which might serve as a target for gamma - ray production ) , the projected location of the emission zone might move in and out of the region covered by a gmc .    one may wonder whether the occurrence of medium size structures like a gmc or a gc in the line of sight of one of the quasar images might affect the spectral shape of the observed gamma rays from those sources .",
    "we note however the optical emission of stars in the gc is too weak to provide a strong absorption of the sub - tev gamma - rays . on the other hand",
    ", the ir radiation from the gmcs would only affect tev photons which are normally not observable from distant sources ( such as lensed blazars ) due to strong absorption by the extragalactic background light .",
    "we investigated the microlensing of  on medium - size structures in its lensing galaxy .",
    "we studied the cases of gc , oc and gmc . we derived the probability of such an event and expected magnification values as well as their time scales .    we conclude that microlensing , occurring on clumps of a gmc , is a tempting alternative to explain the variability of the magnification factor seen in the gev gamma - ray observations of .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the current models of high - energy emission from blazars and , contrary to the microlensing on individual stars , is able to explain the high luminosity of a flare with simple relativistic boosting of the emission .",

    "<S> strong gravitational lensing leads to an occurrence of multiple images , with different magnifications , of a lensed source . </S>",
    "<S> those magnifications can in turn be modified by microlensing on smaller mass scales within the lens . </S>",
    "<S> recently , measurements of the changes in the magnification ratio of the individual images have been proposed as a powerful tool for estimation of the size and velocity of the emission region in the lensed source . </S>",
    "<S> the changes of the magnification ratios in blazars pks1830 - 211 and , if interpreted as caused by a microlensing on individual stars , put strong constraints on those two variables . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints are difficult to accommodate with the current models of gamma - ray emission in blazars . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study if similar changes in the magnification ratio can be caused by microlensing on intermediate size structures in the lensing galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in details three classes of possible lenses : globular clusters ( gc ) , open clusters ( oc ) and giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this scenario to the case of . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that changes in magnifications with similar time scales can be obtained for relativistically moving emission regions with sizes up to 0.01pc in the case of microlensing on the cores of gcs or clumps in gmcs . from the density of such structures in spiral galaxies we estimate however that lensing in giant molecular clouds would be more common .    </S>",
