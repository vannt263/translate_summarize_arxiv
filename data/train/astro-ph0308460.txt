    "has received particular attention since  observations revealed the presence of a broad , asymmetric emission feature between @xmath0 , identified with a highly broadened fe  emission line ( @xcite ) .",
    "the line profile can be explained in terms of fluorescent emission from an accretion disc extending down to @xmath1 about a black hole ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is the relativistic ` disc line ' model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the broad fe  line therefore potentially offers a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in the immediate environment of the black hole ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , modelling the spectrum poses considerable challenges .",
    "along with many seyfert galaxies ,  shows complex absorption in its x - ray spectrum .",
    "this complicates the process of identifying the correct underlying continuum and thereby measuring the superposed line emission .",
    "indeed , the presence of relativistically broadened emission lines in the x - ray spectra of other seyfert 1 galaxies has recently become something of a _ cause celebre _ ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the long ( @xmath3 )  observation of , taken in july  august 2001 simultaneously with , is of great importance since  offers the best established example of a relativistic line profile .",
    "the results have been discussed in a series of papers ( @xcite ) and have been compared with the earlier  observation taken in 2000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following are the primary observational results based on the  dataset .    @xmath4 the two  observations ( taken in 2000 and 2001 ) sampled fairly typical ` states ' of the source . the former observation sampled a period of lower flux than the latter .",
    "however , the long - term  monitoring shows this can be attributed to short - term variability and does not imply a secular difference between the states of the source during the two observations ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "data and @xmath5 data .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 the high energy spectrum obtained from  shows a strong compton - reflection signature ( @xcite ) , as did the earlier /  observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "there was no evidence for a low energy cut - off or roll - over in the continuum out to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath4 the rgs spectrum shows complex absorption including ,  and  and a range of other ions ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fe_edge ] ) .",
    "the opacity is concentrated mainly below @xmath7 but still has an effect on the @xmath8 spectrum ( section  4.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath4 even after accounting for absorption the fluorescent iron line is strong and broad ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the line flux is resolved with epic .",
    "the emission peak concentrated around @xmath9 is resolved with a width @xmath10  , strongly indicating an origin within @xmath11 .",
    "there is also a significant , asymmetric extension to lower energies that indicates strong gravitational redshifts .",
    "in addition there is a weak , intrinsically narrow core to the line emission ( @xcite ) .         range .",
    "the difference spectrum is consistent with a power - law component ( plc ) modified by warm absorption .",
    "the data / model ratio calculated using the best fitting slope is shown with circles . above and below this lie the ratios calculated assuming the @xmath12 per cent lower and upper limits on the slope of the @xmath8 power - law .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 the @xmath13 epic spectrum was well fitted using a model comprising emission from the surface of a relativistic accretion disc .",
    "the strong reflection explains the strength of both the iron line and the compton reflection continuum .",
    "the best fitting model includes emission down to @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath4 previous observations with  ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) showed the photon index of the @xmath15 continuum to be correlated with its flux .",
    "the  observations confirm this and demonstrate the trend is reversed below @xmath16 , where the spectrum hardens with increasing flux ( section  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the average variability amplitude is highest in the range @xmath17 , and is lowest at energies around the iron line .",
    "@xmath4 the variable spectrum can be decomposed into two components , a variable power - law component ( plc : fig .",
    "[ fig : plc ] , see @xcite ) and a relatively constant reflection dominated component ( rdc : fig .",
    "[ fig : rdc ] , see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral variability ( at least on timescales @xmath18 ) can be explained almost entirely by variations in the relative strength of these two components , caused solely by changes in the normalisation of the plc ( @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of the flux - flux plots ( @xcite ) and the difference spectra ( @xcite ) shows the slope of the plc remains approximately constant with flux .",
    "confidence limits obtained from the linear fit to the flux - flux data .",
    "this spectrum closely resembles a reflection dominated component ( rdc ) .",
    "if the constant component contributes a non - zero fraction in the @xmath19 range the contributions at all energies will increase but the spectral shape will remain the same .",
    "the arrows indicate the absolute upper limits on the fraction of constant emission .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 the epic spectrum indicates there is resonance absorption by ionised fe at @xmath20 ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "this was predicted based on the presence of soft x - ray warm absorption ( @xcite ) and has been observed in at least one other high quality epic spectrum ( ngc  3783 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this resonance absorption appeared to vary between the two  observations ( section  6 of @xcite ) .    )",
    "power - law component ( plc ) .",
    "( @xmath21 ) reflection dominated component ( rdc ) .",
    "( @xmath22 ) dusty warm absorber ( dwa ) .",
    "( @xmath23 ) resulting observed spectrum .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 the variations in x - ray luminosity show many striking similarities with those seen in gbhcs such as cygnus x-1 ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] ) .",
    "in particular , the power spectral density ( psd ) function is similar to that expected by simply re - scaling the high / soft state psd of cyg x-1 .",
    "the continuum variations are energy dependent : the psd is a function of energy and the hard variations are delayed with respect to the soft variations .",
    "similar results have been found in other seyfert 1s ( e.g. m@xmath24hardy s article in these proceedings ) .",
    "epic pn light curve .",
    "the psd appears steep at high frequencies and flattens towards lower frequencies .",
    "shown is the ` unfolded ' psd .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "a long observation with  and  of  in its typical state has again confirmed the presence of the broad , skewed iron line .",
    "the best - fitting model includes emission from within @xmath25 , consistent with emission from a disk around a spinning black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral variability can be explained in a phenomenological manner .",
    "the spectrum comprises the sum of two emission spectra modified by warm absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "the two emission spectra are a variable power - law component ( plc ) and a less variable reflection dominated component ( rdc ) .",
    "the relative constancy of the rdc causes variations above @xmath7 ( and particularly around the iron line ) to be suppressed , and also variations below @xmath16 are increasingly suppressed ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a two - component emission model therefore explains the well known correlation between @xmath15 spectral slope and flux ( @xcite ) and the relative lack of iron line variations ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the physics behind the reduced variability of the rdc is unclear .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that gravitational light bending , which may be strong if the disc extends to @xmath26 , is ( partially ) responsible ( @xcite ) ."
