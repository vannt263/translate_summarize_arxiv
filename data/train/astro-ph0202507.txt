    "the main attractive of gravitational lensing being that it probes mass directly , avoiding issues such as mass - light bias .",
    "the perspective of a growing number and quality of weak lensing measurements stimulates the question of how far the use of weak gravitational lensing as an astrophysical and cosmological tool can go , and how much can be achieved . that ultimately depends on the extension and quality of the lensing maps , the amount of information that can be extracted from them , and the ability of this information to differentiate between theoretical models .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of weak gravitational lensing maps to differentiate between different cosmological models .",

    "theoretical predictions for lensing measures can be obtained by two approaches .",
    "the first is the analytical , which is based on gravitational lens theory , and resorts frequently on perturbation theory to calculate expressions for various statistics in an assumed model .",
    "the second approach is to simulate realizations of lensing maps in a chosen model , and directly measure the quantities of choice .",
    "here we review the first , and use the second for an application example .",
    "we obtain that even for modest field sizes ( 9 degrees@xmath1 ) , and noise at the level of current surveys , the cluster normalized cold dark matter models ( scdm , ocdm , and @xmath0cdm ) can be differentiated with significant confidence .",
    "second order statistics ( convergence variance and lensing measures dependent on it ) proved to be the best discriminatory analyses for these models .",

    "this result is particularly important when aiming to differentiate cosmological models that have the same power spectrum , but distinct non - gaussian properties .",
    "we suggest that minkowski functionals should be included in the row of statistics normally used to extract information from lensing maps , because their morphological characterization of maps contains information that is independent of measures such as the probability distribution function of the convergence .",

    "we study the potential of weak gravitational lensing maps to differentiate between different cosmological models , using a variety of statistical measures , including morphological analysis , and taking in account the effects of noise and the uncertainties resulting from a limited field size .",
    "we reviewed how gravitational lensing maps can be generated , and also revisited some statistics that can be used to characterize the lensing maps , or extract information from them .",
    "we introduced the quantity @xmath51 , which quantifies the differentiation between two sets of lensing maps under a given statistic .",

    "several of the analyses considered here were also investigated in previous works , with results consistent with ours .",
    "the novelties presented in this paper are the quantitative description of the differentiation between models ( which proved to be very useful ) , the possibility to compare side - by - side different statistics , and a systematic consideration of the role of noise and field size in all lensing measures .",
    "it was also the first time that the minkowski functionals for noisy maps were calculated .",
    "our results show , as expected , that the lensing measures of small fields have large variance , because of limited sampling .",
    "these large variances imply a small value for the differentiation @xmath51 : the observation of a too small sky patch does not allow the discrimination of cosmological models .",
    "other general behavior , independent of the analysis or model considered , is the approximation of the differentiation values obtained for pure and noisy convergence maps when the smoothing angle is large . as smoothing increases the noise variance decreases ( noise becomes irrelevant for a sufficiently high smoothing angle ) , but",
    "the pure convergence is also homogenized , and the differentiation between models becomes small .",
    "our results suggest that it is advantageous for model discrimination purposes to use a minimum smoothing , even considering that this implies a noisier map .    for purposes of discriminating the three models examined in our simulations , the variance and the angular power spectrum of the convergence ( two of the most simple and popular analysis ) proved to be very good lensing measures .",
    "even for small field sizes , and noisy maps , the convergence variance can differentiate between the models at a great confidence level ( if the smoothing is not too extreme ) .",
    "higher order statistics ( @xmath32 , skewness , @xmath33 , kurtosis , and minkowski functionals ) have higher variances ( error bars ) in general , and lower discriminating power for the examined models . however , the information obtained from these statistics is precious for its independence from the information offered by statistics such as field variance , and angular power spectrum .",
    "it is possible to imagine two cosmological models that have the same mass power spectrum , but different non - gaussian features .",
    "we found that the second minkowski functional ( @xmath114 ) is an equal or better model discriminant than the more commonly used third functional ( the topological genus ) , and is very competitive in relation to other measures .",
    "this suggests that minkowski functionals should be included in the row of available statistics to maximally extract information from weak lensing maps .",
    "they should be particularly useful to differentiate models that have the same pdf , but distinct morphology .",
    "the presence of noise makes the extraction of information about non - gaussian features of the pure convergence much more intricate .",
    "while for the analyses that are blind to non - gaussianities ( variance and angular power spectrum ) the noise term is clearly isolated from the pure convergence term , for analyses sensitive to non - gaussianities ( with exception of @xmath32 ) the noise terms are entangled with the pure convergence terms ( see equations [ [ pdf - convolution ] ] , [ [ kappa4 ] ] , [ [ noisy - v0 ] ] , and [ [ noisy - s3]-[noisy - dk2 ] ] ) .",
    "so , even for a simple noise model as the one used in our simulations , the modification of the lensing measures due to noise is nontrivial .",
    "that implies that the retrieval of information about the pure convergence field ( and ultimately , from the underlying large - scale structure and cosmological model ) from noisy maps is also nontrivial - even more when the noise field is not well known .",
    "minkowski functionals are a particularly severe example of this entanglement between the pure convergence with noise ( as shown in appendix [ mink - noisy ] ) .",
    "the complicated analytical description of lensing measures sensitive to non - gaussian features of noisy maps , and the intrinsic difficulty of incorporating observational aspects trough the analytical approach , favors the use of simulations over an analytical approach for observational predictions , or parameter estimation from real lensing maps .",
    "these arguments add to the work of jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) , which points to the limitations of perturbation theory in providing accurate predictions for most weak lensing statistics at small scales ( low smoothing ) .",
    "different statistics of weak gravitational lensing maps reveal distinct features of its originating cosmic mass distribution and geometry .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive and realistic study of the underlying cosmological model through weak lensing requires the use of a set of statistics , and the understanding of how these statistics and their variances are affected by observational constraints such as field size and the presence of noise .",
