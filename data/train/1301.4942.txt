    "<S> furthermore , sparse topographic protrusions on the @xmath19 surface ( e.g.  marked by yellow arrow ) show a lower lbh close to that of the flat @xmath18 surface , suggesting that they are scattered remaining ca or pr atoms ( see supplementary information * s - ii * ) . </S>",

    "<S> we expect the lbh to be affected by differences in the local environments for as / ca atoms on pr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  versus their respective pure elements . a dominant contribution to these differences may be due to dipole barriers arising from charge redistribution at the surface @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this can increase or decrease the measured lbh according to the relative sign and magnitude of surface dipole barrier on pr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  versus the pure element single crystals represented in table i. we therefore expect @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the pure element work functions , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the additional energies for an electron to escape the dipole layers at the as- and ca - terminated surfaces of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 . assuming @xmath47 @xcite , the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and their difference @xmath48 are all of the correct magnitude for such dipole layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the difference , which indicates that it is harder to remove an electron from the dipole barrier of the as surface than that of the half - ca surface , is physically justified because the half - ca surface is nonpolar , whereas the as surface is deficient of electrons from the stripped ca , and thus more electronegative . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred electron - deficiency of this as surface is consistent with the failure to observe even proximity - induced superconductivity on the as - terminated surface of the related sr@xmath49k@xmath50fe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the density of atoms in the surface layer is also known to affect the measured lbh @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theories that treat the ionic lattice pseudopotential as a perturbation predict @xmath5110% variations among different faces of single crystals @xcite . measurements on cu(100 ) , cu(110 ) , cu(112 ) , and cu(111 ) confirm variations of at most 10% @xcite although the surface density of atoms differs by almost 65% between cu(110 ) and cu(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the 50% difference in atom density between 1 x 2 and 1 x 1 surfaces of pr@xmath0ca@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  is unlikely to account for the 26% difference we observe between lbh values on these surfaces ( fig .  2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note the reduced lbh along the step edge in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , which may be attributed to two mechanisms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the step edge is effectively an angled surface , so the lbh is reduced by @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the smoluchowski smoothing of the electron wave functions along the step edge results in an additional dipole moment which reduces the lbh @xcite .     surface structures . </S>",

    "<S> both datasets were acquired at @xmath40=105 pa and @xmath41=100 mv . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 calibration used here was obtained by assuming that the average lbh for the @xmath18 surface in the boxed region of ( b ) here is the same as that in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we note that the appearance of dimerization @xcite may be an artifact attributed to hybridization between the surface @xmath4 atoms and the underlying as atoms @xcite .    for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the nature of the `` web - like '' surface . because it merges smoothly into the @xmath18 surface without any evident step edges [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) ] , it is also likely a reconstruction of the ca layer . </S>",

    "<S> this reinforces the necessity of flat atomic planes in order to extract a reliable lbh comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we reiterate that our identification of the @xmath19 surface as a complete as layer and the @xmath18 surface as a half - ca layer is robustly drawn from the flat surfaces in fig .  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath44 and @xmath54 differ by less than 1% ( table  [ tab : workfunction ] ) , lbh mapping can not be used to identify pr atoms in the ca surface layer . however , stm can image dopants using the differential conductance @xmath55 , which is proportional to the local density of states @xcite . substituting pr@xmath56 for ca@xmath57 </S>",

    "<S> although a subset of co dopants were previously imaged in ca(fe@xmath1co@xmath6)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite , this is the first time that _ all _ dopants have been imaged in a ca122 system .     </S>",

    "<S> our observation of the expected number of pr dopants , more homogeneously distributed than would be expected for a random distribution , suggests that dopant clustering is unlikely to be responsible for the small volume fraction high-@xmath3 superconducting state . in conclusion , </S>",

    "<S> this lbh mapping method could be used to resolve debated cleaved surface terminations in a wide variety of materials , such as other fe - scs @xcite or heavy fermion materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we demonstrated by direct imaging that the pr dopants responsible for superconductivity do not cluster , and in fact show a slight repulsion at very short length scales . </S>",
