    "in this paper we show how the invocation of sterile neutrinos in a novel transformation scenario can enable the production of the heavy rapid - neutron - capture ( @xmath2-process @xcite ) elements in neutrino - heated ejecta from supernovae .",
    "interestingly , the current hints of ( and constraints on ) neutrino oscillation phenomena from considerations of solar @xcite and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite and from the lsnd experiment @xcite are difficult to explain with only two independent neutrino mass - squared differences ( corresponding to three active neutrino species ) @xcite . by contrast , the data are explained readily in terms of neutrino oscillations with three independent mass - squared differences , corresponding to four neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "however , the observed width of the z@xmath3 @xcite can accomodate only three light , active neutrinos .",
    "therefore , a fit to the data requires introducing at least one light sterile  neutrino species which does not have normal weak interactions [ e.g. , a majorana su(2 ) singlet neutrino ] .",
    "the most promising site for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis is the neutrino - heated material ejected relatively long ( @xmath4 ) after the explosion of a type ii or type ib / c supernova @xcite .",
    "however , detailed calculations of the conditions which obtain above the neutron star remnant in such @xmath2-process models show that the neutron - to - seed ratio , @xmath5 , is too low to allow the production of the heaviest @xmath2-process species @xcite .",
    "( the seed  nuclei which capture neutrons to make the heavier species have nuclear mass numbers between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . )",
    "we require @xmath8 to effect a good @xmath2-process yield for heavy nuclear species , but the models with conventional neutrino physics and conventional equations of state for nuclear matter all give smaller values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is the neutron deficit problem for these models of the @xmath2-process .    in all models , @xmath5 is determined by the net electron - to - baryon number ( i.e. , the electron fraction ) , @xmath9 , the entropy - per - baryon in the ejecta , @xmath10 , and the dynamic expansion timescale , @xmath11 , associated with the material ejection process @xcite . though general relativistic effects @xcite and multi - dimensional hydrodynamic outflow @xcite have been invoked to increase @xmath10 and decrease @xmath12 ( both of these changes favoring larger @xmath5 ) enough to solve the neutron deficit problem , these solutions are at best finely tuned . on general grounds",
    "we could argue that the only robust way to obtain @xmath13 in conventional _ neutrino - heated _ ejecta is to decrease @xmath9 and/or maintain its low value by invoking new neutrino physics , e.g. , introducing a sterile neutrino as discussed in this paper .",
    "( by robust  we mean robust to astrophysical uncertainties in the detailed characteristics of neutrino - heated outflow . )",
    "we can not definitively proclaim at this point that new neutrino physics is required to understand the production of heavy @xmath2-process elements .",
    "such a proclamation calls for the accomplishment of the following .",
    "first , we would have to establish that at least some of the @xmath2-process material originates in conventional neutrino - heated ejecta .",
    "second , we would have to understand the thermal and hydrodynamic evolution of the very late stage neutrino - driven `` winds '' from a proto - neutron star .",
    "the proposition that some of the @xmath2-process material comes from environments with intense neutrino fluxes is supported by recent studies of neutrino effects during and immediately following the @xmath2-process @xcite .",
    "perhaps more to the point , recent observational data on the abundances of @xmath2-process species in old , very metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy seem to be quite consistent with what is expected from the @xmath2-process scenario associated with neutrino - heated ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , the second issue we would have to resolve is a vexing one . despite the extensive numerical insights into the early phase of the supernova evolution @xcite , consistent and accurate hydrodynamic scenarios for neutron stars to lose mass through neutrino heating at very late times remain to be established . on the positive side ,",
    "burrows @xcite has recently followed his supernova calculations long enough to see the formation of a neutrino - driven wind at late times . in the region",
    "relevant for nucleosynthesis , the wind in his calculations resembles in broad brush the outflow models studied here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe a simple model for the neutrino - heated outflow and discuss the associated alpha effect which causes the neutron deficit problem for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the treatment of active - sterile plus active - active neutrino transformation in supernovae and describe how such transformation can evade the alpha effect . the consequence of such transformation for the evolution of the electron fraction @xmath9 in the neutrino - heated outflow is studied in sec .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in what follows we adopt a simple exponential wind model for the neutrino - driven outflow above the surface of the hot proto - neutron star produced by a supernova explosion . in this model the enthalpy per baryon is roughly the gravitational binding energy of a baryon , leading to a relation between radius @xmath14 ( in units of @xmath15 ) , entropy - per - baryon @xmath16 ( in units of @xmath7 times the boltzmann constant ) , and temperature @xmath17 ( in units of @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the proto - neutron star .",
    "therefore , for a constant entropy per baryon characterizing the adiabatic expansion of the outflow , the temperature parameterizes the radius @xcite .",
    "the entropy typically will be carried almost exclusively by relativistic particles ( photons and electron - positron pairs ) so that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the statistical weight for relativistic particles and @xmath23 is avogadro s number .",
    "this leads to a simple relation between ( matter ) density @xmath24 and radius : @xmath25 where we have scaled @xmath22 assuming its value at @xmath26 . as we will be mostly interested in processes occurring at @xmath26 ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath22 will be suppressed hereafter .    in the exponential wind the radius of an outflowing mass element",

    "@xmath12 is an assumed constant material expansion timescale .",
    "this implies an outflow velocity proportional to radius , @xmath29 , so that the neutrino - driven wind will remain roughly self similar for timescales on which the neutrino luminosities and energy spectra and the neutron star radius can be regarded as constant .",
    "clearly , at some point above the neutron star surface the exponential wind must go over to a linear expansion of the radius , i.e. , a coasting  outflow .",
    "nevertheless , the exponential wind regime should encompass the region above the neutron star where most of the biggest obstacle to successful @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis , the alpha effect ( see below ) , is operative @xcite .    in neutrino - heated ejecta ,",
    "neutrino interactions with matter supply the requisite energy for ejection of nucleosynthesis products .",
    "the total amount of heating through these interactions determines @xmath10 and @xmath12 in the ejecta .",
    "most of this heating occurs close to the neutron star and @xmath10 and @xmath12 are set at @xmath30 .",
    "however , the dominant interactions for neutrino heating @xmath31 and @xmath32 have prolonged effects on the neutron - to - proton ratio ( @xmath33 ) in the ejecta .",
    "first of all , in the region where @xmath26 and free nucleons are favored by nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , the competition between the processes in eqs .",

    "absent neutrino oscillations ( flavor / type mixings ) , we expect @xmath43 and , hence , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , corresponding to neutron - rich ejecta ) @xcite .",
    "we note that the numerical value of the @xmath46 ratio depends on careful calculation of the rates @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite and accurate determination of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite . however , the alpha effect discussed below is insensitive to the value of the @xmath46 ratio obtained at @xmath26 .",
    "the equilibrium of the @xmath46 ratio with the @xmath40 and @xmath39 fluxes described above is maintained until the ejecta passes the weak freeze - out radius ( at @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 , beyond which @xmath36 , @xmath49 and free nucleons are no longer favored by nse @xcite .",
    "however , even beyond @xmath48 , @xmath40 capture on neutrons can force down the @xmath46 ratio and , hence , the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath5 .",
    "this is the so - called alpha effect  @xcite : as material flows to regions where the composition favored by nse shifts from free nucleons to a mixture of free nucleons and alpha particles , protons will be incorporated into alpha particles , leaving a disproportionate fraction of neutrons exposed to the intense flux of @xmath40 .",

    "( [ eqn : yet ] ) it can be seen that regardless of the freeze - out value @xmath53 , sufficient exposure to the @xmath40 flux above @xmath48 will drive @xmath9 close to 0.5 ( @xmath56 , i.e. , no neutron excess ) .    in summary",
    ", a great paradox exists for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in a neutrino - driven wind .",
    "in such a scenario the neutrinos must supply enough energy [ largely through the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : n ] ) and ( [ eqn : p ] ) ] to lift baryons out of the gravitational potential well of the neutron star .",
    "the gravitational binding energy per nucleon near the neutron star surface is @xmath57 .",
    "since the average @xmath40 and @xmath39 energies are @xmath58 , a nucleon must interact with neutrinos @xmath59 times in order to acquire enough energy for ejection from the neutron star . in turn , this requires a sufficiently large value of @xmath60 , thus providing conditions for a pernicious alpha effect which will cause a neutron deficit .",
    "such a neutron deficit will preclude a successful @xmath2-process , especially the synthesis of the heaviest nuclear species .    however , it is obvious that removal of the @xmath40 flux could neatly solve the neutron deficit problem by unbalancing the competition between the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : n ] ) and ( [ eqn : p ] ) in favor of neutron production ( thus lowering @xmath9 ) and by disabling the alpha effect in regions beyond @xmath48 ( thus maintaining a low @xmath9 ) . furthermore , as neutrino heating is essentially completed at @xmath30 ( quite close to the neutron star surface ) , the beneficial effects of removing the @xmath40 flux can be obtained without affecting the general thermal and hydrodynamic characteristics of the neutrino - heated outflow ( see sec .",
    "the existence of at least one light sterile neutrino could provide a means to reduce the @xmath40 flux at sufficiently large radius to leave the process of neutrino - heated ejection unhindered , yet sufficiently near or inside @xmath48 so as to disable the alpha effect , and thereby fix the neutron deficit problem for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",

    "charged - current capture reactions on neutrons are energetically forbidden for supernova @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "( [ eqn : pnue])([eqn : pnutau ] ) we see that after adiabatic evolution through the @xmath160 and @xmath141 resonances , ( 1 ) a @xmath40 emitted from the neutron star [ i.e. , @xmath196 would become 50% @xmath65 and 50% @xmath66 ; ( 2 ) a @xmath65 emitted from the neutron star [ i.e. , @xmath197 would become 50% @xmath63 , 25% @xmath65 , and 25% @xmath66 ; and ( 3 ) a @xmath66 emitted from the neutron star [ i.e. , @xmath198 would become 50% @xmath63 , 25% @xmath65 , and 25% @xmath66 . clearly ,",
    "as no sterile neutrinos are emitted from the neutron star , the @xmath40 flux would be removed at those energies for which adiabatic evolution through the @xmath160 and @xmath141 resonances is completed .",
    "therefore , if such neutrino evolution can be engineered to occur below the weak freeze - out radius and convert most of the @xmath40 emitted from the neutron star to other species before the electron fraction falls near or below 1/3 , then we will have succeeded in disabling the alpha effect .",
    "consider the @xmath9 evolution of a mass / fluid element moving outward from the neutron star surface ( i.e. , the neutrino sphere ) . in the absence of neutrino flavor / type transformation",
    ", this fluid element would be irradiated by the @xmath40 , @xmath39 , @xmath65 , @xmath199 , @xmath66 , and @xmath200 fluxes emitted from the neutrino sphere throughout its progress toward ejection .",
    "( there should not be an _",
    "appreciable _ flux of sterile neutrinos coming from the neutron star interior .",
    "though a small sterile neutrino flux will not affect our conclusions , it is nonetheless interesting to note that for our assumed scheme of neutrino masses and mixings , matter effects inside the proto - neutron star should suppress strongly the production of sterile neutrinos . ) of course , the occurrence of the @xmath201 resonance will cause the fluid element to experience deviation of its @xmath9 evolution from the standard case with no neutrino flavor / type transformation .    as discussed in sec .",
    "iiib , the @xmath140 resonance occurs before ( at higher temperature than ) the @xmath143 resonance for @xmath170 .",
    "further , neutrinos with lower energies generally go through the two resonances before those with higher energies . consequently , the two resonances will sweep through the relevant neutrino energy distribution functions when viewed in the frame of a fluid element as it moves from the neutrino sphere at high temperature towards regions of lower temperature .",
    "the energy - position of the @xmath202 resonance within the distribution functions , i.e. , the resonance energy @xmath203 , is related to temperature @xmath17 and radius @xmath14 through the resonance condition as @xmath204 } \\left({10\\over t_9}\\right)^3s_{100}\\cr & & \\cr & \\approx & 2.58\\,{\\rm mev}{\\left ( { { \\delta m^2_{\\mu^ *   e}}\\over{6\\,{\\rm ev}^2 } } \\right ) } { \\left[{0.4\\over y_e+y_{\\nu_e } -(y_{\\nu_\\mu}+y_{\\nu_\\tau})/2}\\right ] } { \\left({1.4\\,m_\\odot\\over m_{\\rm ns}}\\right)^3 } s_{100}^4 r_6 ^ 3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when a fluid element reaches a given radius , we can regard all @xmath40 emitted from the neutrino sphere with energies less than the corresponding @xmath205 at this radius as having changed to either @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "note that no conversion into @xmath40 occurs as the @xmath190 component of the @xmath65 or @xmath66 emitted from the neutrino sphere with the relevant energies will have been converted into sterile neutrinos before reaching the @xmath202 resonance .",
    "( adiabatic neutrino evolution through the @xmath206 and @xmath202 resonances is assumed here . )",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath39 capture rates in the fluid element , @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively , will both decrease with increasing radius due to the geometric dilution of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , as @xmath205 increases , conversion into @xmath65 or @xmath66 will further decrease the @xmath40 flux in addition to the geometric dilution .",
    "consequently , the rate @xmath36 for raising @xmath9 will decrease more with increasing radius than the rate @xmath35 for lowering @xmath9 .",
    "one would then expect @xmath9 to be lowered progressively as the fluid element moves towards larger radius .",
    "if @xmath207 is reached , the order of the @xmath140 and @xmath143 resonances will reverse ( see sec .",
    "iiib ) and further transformation of @xmath40 will cease . in principle",
    "this could be worrisome as the evasion of the alpha effect requires that the bulk of the @xmath40 flux over a substantial range of energies be transformed away prior to the point of alpha - particle formation .",
    "however , in practice the defeat of the alpha effect through removal of the @xmath40 flux will be achieved for the expected conditions in the neutrino - heated ejecta and plausible neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "this is because @xmath40 conversion coupled with the expected rapid expansion of the ejecta will cause the actual value of @xmath9 at a given radius to differ significantly from the equilibrium value corresponding to the local @xmath40 and @xmath39 fluxes .",
    "this equilibrium value at radius @xmath2 is defined as @xmath208 as discussed above , in the presence of neutrino flavor / type transformation , the decrease of @xmath209 due to conversion of @xmath40 into @xmath65 or @xmath66 in addition to the geometric decrease common to both @xmath209 and @xmath210 tends to lower @xmath211 at larger radius .",
    "thus we have @xmath212 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath9 evolution of a fluid element prior to the point of alpha - particle formation is governed by @xmath213y_e(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath214 is the outflow velocity at radius @xmath2 .",
    "to first order , the solution to eq .",

    "however , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ye1 ] ) , this acts to increase @xmath9 above @xmath211 .",
    "further , a larger increase is obtained for a larger outflow velocity @xmath216 corresponding to a more rapid expansion of the fluid element .",
    "consequently , flavor evolution of @xmath40 with energies important for determining @xmath9 can occur with @xmath217 in the rapidly expanding neutrino - heated ejecta for a range of outflow conditions and neutrino mixing parameters .    as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thresh ] ) , the resonance energy @xmath205 at a given radius depends on the effective neutrino numbers relative to baryons @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",

    "( [ eqn : a ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath229 taking , for example , @xmath230  erg  s@xmath231 , @xmath232  mev , and @xmath233  mev , which are plausibly characteristic of neutrino emission at very late times , we have @xmath234 at @xmath47 for @xmath235 and @xmath236 . therefore , compared with typical values of @xmath237 ,",
    "@xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 can be neglected .",
    "further , the effects of the neutrino backgrounds on neutrino flavor / type evolution are especially small for low values of @xmath16 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : aa ] ) ] .",
    "this is because important neutrino flavor / type evolution occurs over a relatively narrow range of temperatures and for a lower entropy , these temperatures correspond to larger radii [ see eq . ( [ eqn : wind1 ] ) ] where neutrino fluxes are smaller .    in order to disable the alpha effect",
    ", we would like to have the bulk of the @xmath40 flux at @xmath238  mev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) transformed away before the point of alpha - particle formation ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this requires that the @xmath40 conversion front be at @xmath239  mev when the neutrino - heated ejecta has reached the radius corresponding to @xmath240 . with a typical entropy of @xmath236 and values of @xmath241 in the ejecta , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : thresh ] ) that this requirement is indeed fulfilled for @xmath242  ev@xmath70 .",
    "the typical evolution of @xmath9 in the neutrino - heated ejecta with @xmath140 plus @xmath143 transformation can then be summarized as follows . at @xmath30 ,",
    "the electron fraction has a typical value of @xmath237 in equilibrium with the @xmath40 and @xmath39 fluxes . as the ejecta moves to regions of lower temperature , the @xmath40 conversion front at @xmath205 moves towards the high - energy end of the @xmath40 energy distribution function and removes the @xmath40 flux at @xmath243",
    "this suppresses the destruction of neutrons and lowers @xmath9 somewhat below @xmath244 . however , @xmath40 conversion coupled with the expansion of the ejecta causes rapid change in the instantaneous equilibrium @xmath9 value , @xmath211 , and maintains @xmath245 .",
    "consequently , conversion of @xmath40 with energies important for determining @xmath9 is completed at @xmath170 .",
    "when the ejecta reaches the point of alpha - particle formation at @xmath47 , the @xmath40 conversion front is at @xmath239  mev and the bulk of the @xmath40 flux has been removed .",
    "this then defeats the alpha effect which would drive @xmath9 close to 0.5 if a significant flux of @xmath40 existed to destroy neutrons at @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , our scenario of @xmath140 plus @xmath143 transformation ensures that @xmath247 can be obtained and _ maintained _ before the onset of rapid neutron capture in the neutrino - heated ejecta .",
    "while this scenario does not lead to very low values of @xmath9 , it nevertheless guarantees a range of @xmath9 that will lead to a successful @xmath2-process when combined with the appropriate entropy @xmath10 and the dynamic expansion timescale @xmath12 in the ejecta .",
    "the alpha effect is the single biggest impediment to obtaining the necessary conditions for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino - heated ejecta from supernovae . in fact",
    ", this effect may also be an obstacle for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino - heated ejecta from neutron - star mergers .",
    "the central problem is that the @xmath40 flux causing ejection of baryons from deep in the gravitational potential well of the neutron star will destroy neutrons via @xmath248 in the regions of alpha - particle formation .",
    "this destruction of neutrons then renders the subsequent neutron capture process incapable of producing the heavy @xmath2-process elements .",
    "we have suggested a scheme of neutrino masses and mixings which could solve this conundrum by removing the @xmath40 flux through matter - enhanced @xmath249 plus @xmath82 transformation above the regions of efficient neutrino heating but below the regions of alpha - particle formation .",
    "this scheme which rescues @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino - heated ejecta originally was not constructed for this purpose .",
    "rather , it was designed to explain simultaneously the solar neutrino data and the anomalous atmospheric @xmath73 ratio and to allow for a hot component of dark matter .",
    "subsequently , it also explained the lsnd signal .",
    "in fact , this scheme with a maximally - mixed @xmath65-@xmath66 doublet split from a lower - mass @xmath40-@xmath63 doublet by @xmath250 may be the only one which can escape elimination by recent interpretations of the superk atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and by big bang nucleosynthesis considerations @xcite .    while we do not know if there is a way other than invoking neutrino mixing to circumvent the alpha effect in neutrino - heated ejecta , attempts at `` astrophysical '' dodge of this effect made so far ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) seem to be finely tuned at best . absent a non - neutrino - physics escape from the alpha effect",
    ", we could draw interesting inferences about galactic chemical evolution were future experiments to reveal a neutrino mass scheme _ other _ than the one that aids the @xmath2-process . in that case , for example , we could be forced to re - think the origin of the bulk of the @xmath2-process material in the galaxy . in turn , this could have consequences for our understanding of the rates and physics of , e.g. , neutron - star mergers . or we could be forced to re - think electromagnetic ejection of material from supernovae .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2-process connection , our scheme of neutrino masses and mixings has interesting consequences for detection of neutrinos from future galactic supernovae . as the solar neutrino problem is solved by @xmath251 mixing in this scheme , sterile neutrinos produced by the @xmath249 transformation near the neutron star will be converted into @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , at late times of the supernova process , there may be a significant _ increase _ in the average @xmath40 energy with no accompanying increase in the average @xmath39 energy .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that neutrino flavor transformation has important effects on the dynamics of supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "conceivably , neutrino mixing also affects the nucleosynthesis discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which occurs shortly after the supernova explosion .",
    "currently , we are investigating the effects of our scheme of neutrino masses and mixings at these early times .    from this work , one conclusion specific to particle physics",
    "is that evasion of the alpha effect and , hence , robust production of the @xmath2-process elements in neutrino - heated ejecta seem to require at least one light sterile neutrino species .",
    "we have shown here that one neutrino mass scheme to disable the alpha effect has a maximally - mixed @xmath65-@xmath66 doublet split from a lower - mass @xmath40-@xmath63 doublet . however ,",
    "another scheme @xcite , which has three light , nearly - degenerate active neutrinos and a heavier sterile neutrino species , has also been suggested to do the same . though this latter scheme has the attractive feature of a significant increase in the neutron excess , considerations that do not concern the @xmath2-process argue against it . finally ,",
    "if we adopt the neutrino mass scheme of this paper , then the splitting between the doublets must be @xmath252  ev@xmath70 in order to have the beneficial effects on the @xmath2-process .",
    "note that this splitting is within the lsnd range and most likely in the upper sector of it . of course",
    ", these conclusions presuppose that _ some _ of the @xmath2-process material in the galaxy originated in neutrino - heated ejecta ( from either supernovae or neutron - star mergers ) and that there is no conventional astrophysical fix for the alpha effect .",
    "our conclusions will be tested by neutrino experiments as well as and astrophysical observations on @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis . in any case , it is both surprising and tantalizing that mixings among active and sterile neutrino species with small masses can have such profound effects on the physics of astrophysical objects and the synthesis of the heaviest elements .",
