    "in contrast with  normal  systems with short range interactions , the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems is non - extensive and , because of the infinite range and singularity of the newtonian potential , can not be treated by standard methods .",
    "a partial remedy for these problems can be constructed by confining the system in a finite volume and either using a regularized newtonian pair interaction potential , or considering the n - body system in the mean - field limit where it is possible to construct an analytic theory of @xmath0 , the single particle density in position and velocity .",
    "the first mean - field formulations showed that ( 1 ) spherically symmetric density profiles represent the states of highest entropy and ( 2 ) a global entropy maximum does not exist @xcite .",
    "it is always possible to increase the entropy by simultaneously increasing the central density and transferring mass to a diffuse ",
    "halo  to control the value of the energy .",
    "this phenomenon , called gravothermal catastrophe in the literature , reflects the fact that an isolated and bounded gravitational system can not be in equilibrium in the mean - field limit .",
    "locally stable and unstable entropy extrema can exist , however , if the system s energy is above a critical value @xcite , and their stability has been investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "in addition to the total energy , @xmath1 , in the mean field limit the sum of squares of the angular momentum , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angular momentum of a system element , is also an integral of motion for a spherically symmetric gravitational system , @xcite .",
    "if , along with the energy , this constraint is also included in mft ( mean field theory ) the result is an anisotropic distribution in velocity .",
    "the result was first obtained by eddington from a different route @xcite .",
    "until recently , this second integral has been ignored in investigations of thermodynamic stability in the mean field ( vlasov ) limit , leaving open the possibility that a centrifugal barrier could prevent collapse and stabilize the system .",
    "in fact , we have recently shown that even its inclusion in mft can not resolve the gravothermal catastrophe , and it persists in both the generalized microcanonical ( @xmath4 ) and canonical ( @xmath5 ) ensembles @xcite .",
    "the extremal solutions have the form @xmath6 , which coincides with the well known anisotropic density fit models that have been applied to globular cluster observations with some success(e.g .",
    "king - michie models ) @xcite .    in their seminal work on the gravothermal catastrophe , lynden - bell and wood @xcite pointed out that in the absence of the short range singularity , the possibility existed for a gravitational system to exist in different thermodynamics phases . using mean - field models with a regularized newtonian potential which has been dissected to remove the singularity @xcite or , equivalently , introducing repulsion at short - range by imposing a local equation of state in the mean field picture @xcite , it has been shown that a first order phase transition can occur in both the microcanonical ( mce ) and canonical ( ce ) ensembles .",
    "unfortunately , for finite @xmath7 systems , there are no exact microcanonical results available which allow the rigorous proof of a phase transition or catastrophe . however , in the canonical case , it has been rigorously proved that the system of gravitating point masses is in a collapsed state in equilibrium in the absence of regularization @xcite .",
    "moreover , monte - carlo simulations for a regularized newtonian potential confirm the gravitational phase transition in ce @xcite in large @xmath7 systems .",
    "while mean field theories support the existence of phase transitions in gravitational systems , it is important to point out that there is no guarantee that these equilibrium states will be realized by dynamical evolution .",
    "in fact , there is no proof that the two operations of taking ( 1 ) the mean field limit , or ( 2 ) the infinite time average , commute @xcite .",
    "rather , simulations of the one dimensional self - gravitating system consisting of parallel mass sheets provide strong evidence to the contrary @xcite . as a consequence , the relation between maximum entropy solutions of the stationary mean field equation and the time average distribution functions resulting from n body simulation , or dynamical evolution in nature , has not been fully established .",
    "this is a deep question which will not be explored further here .",
    "thus , although much is known concerning the  equilibrium  properties in the mean field limit , the dynamical properties of gravitational phase transitions are not well known due to a lack of true n - body simulations , which are also important for explaining the evolution of stellar clusters , galaxies , etc .. at the present time the mean - field predictions of the gravitational phase transition have only been dynamically confirmed ( in both mce and ce ) for the model system consisting of irrotational , concentric , mass shells @xcite . in that model",
    ", the newtonian singularity was screened by the introduction of an inner barrier which excluded mass from the system center .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate and understand the dynamical features of gravitational phase transitions in n - body simulations for the model of a purely newtonian system in which @xmath8 for each system element .",
    "we will refer to this system as the @xmath9 model .",
    "we will explicitly investigate a system of rotating , concentric , mass shells . in the mean field limit , this system shares important features , e.g. the equilibrium density and radial velocity distribution , with the more realistic system of point masses . recently , with i. prokhorenkov , we showed that the gravitational phase transition is present in both mce and ce in certain regions of @xmath9 and we studied its properties using mean field theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , we rigorously proved the existence of an upper bound for the entropy in the mce ( lower bound in the free energy in the ce ) for @xmath10 in the same work .",
    "it is important to understand that this model demonstrates the significance of the influence of angular momentum on the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems , even if they are spherical .",
    "the generalized microcanonical ( @xmath11 ) and canonical ( @xmath12 ) ensembles discussed earlier @xciteare appropriate for large @xmath7 spherical systems where angular momentum exchange occurs . while providing the most general mean field description @xcite , @xmath13 is still not a sufficient constraint to resolve the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "clearly the culprit is angular momentum exchange , which is still permitted even if both energy and @xmath13 are fixed , and allows the transfer of mass to the system center .",
    "an open question is the possible existence of additional mechanisms for establishing a centrifugal barrier which prevents , or strongly inhibits , collapse in nature , e.g. in globular clusters or molecular clouds .",
    "this will be taken up in the final section .    in the following",
    ", first we briefly review the @xmath9 model , including the mean - field predictions , and discuss the main features of the n - body algorithm we designed for its dynamical simulation .",

    "we compare the time - averaged equilibrium properties with the predictions of mean field theory resulting from our earlier investigation , and also touch on finite size effects .",
    "we then go on to study both equilibrium and dynamical features which can not be predicted by mean field theory , such as the variance of fluctuations , and correlations in both time and position .",
    "in addition to the system behavior near the phase transition , we pay particular attention to the critical point , and the supercritical region . finally we consider the surprising features exhibited by different stages of the relaxation process itself , and their dependence on energy , @xmath9 , and population , and discuss the possible presence of collective modes .     in the mean - field limit .",

    "we can clearly see from the figures that at about @xmath22 , a microcanonical phase transition takes place between a quasi - uniform and a centrally dense core - halo state .",
    "this type of phase transition is a unique feature of a self - gravitating system , since the two different phases can not coexist .",
    "the selected value of @xmath9 is sufficiently small that the stable and metastable phases are well separated , yet not so small that dynamical simulation becomes intractable .",

    "we easily observe that there is a critical value of @xmath75 where the width of the metastable region vanishes and beyond which a transition does nt occur .",
    "this is a true critical point : keeping in mind the analogy with the liquid - vapor transition , states with @xmath76 which characterize the supercritical region are analogous to the fluid phase . a useful representative of both the low and high energy phase is the virial ratio @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are , respectively , the total system kinetic and potential energy .",

    "the main advantages of the model over the conventional @xmath7 body system of point masses are that it preserves spherical symmetry , and it is only necessary to evaluate those discrete time events which occur either when two shells cross one another , or one shell arrives at a turning point or the outer boundary . between these events , the equations of motion induced by @xmath85",
    "are easily integrated in closed form yielding the time as an explicit function of position .",
    "thus the amount of numerical error and computation time can be greatly reduced , and simulations can be performed until thermal equilibrium is obtained .",

    "is required , and it becomes increasingly more difficult to numerically resolve successive shell crossings which may become closely spaced in time and position during the course of long simulations . as in the case of the irrotational shells studied earlier ,",
    "@xcite the dynamics of the system showed highly chaotic behavior and substantial mixing in @xmath115 space , i.e. in the @xmath67 plane .",

    "the spontaneous fluctuations were large , on the order of the mean value , but for the larger populations they settled down .",

    "interestingly , for both the high ( fig .",
    "[ figrelaxhigh ] ) and low energy ( fig .  [ figrelaxlow ] ) phases , the exponent @xmath141 was not @xmath7 dependent , and the relaxation was similar in both phases with @xmath142 .",

    "[ figkecorrfluidn ] , we plot the correlation functions for different values of @xmath7 at @xmath52 and @xmath54 . note that as we approach the mean - field limit , the non - vanishing tail has a larger value , and the oscillating part has a longer duration .",
    "this suggests that , with increasing @xmath7 , single particle behavior is suppressed and the system starts to behave like a vlasov fluid . in the mean - field limit , the effective potential @xmath149 always has a minimum . for large values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the width of this region becomes larger , possibly allowing low frequency collective modes to develop in the system .",
    "similar behavior was observed by rouet et .",
    "al . for the system of planar mass sheets",
    "there the initial system was prepared in a stationary  waterbag  state .",
    "they found that kinetic energy fluctuations had the frequency of the collective modes , rather than that of the individual closed vlasov orbits in the ( @xmath150 @xmath151 phase plane .",
    "the same phenomena may be occurring in the @xmath9 model as well .",
    "supporting evidence was provided by the correlation matrix which showed strong correlations in position in the central part of the system for these thermodynamics states .",
    "the role of thermodynamics in controlling the evolution of gravitational systems is only partially understood , and there are many open questions .",
    "it is our impression that recently this subject is attracting increased attention .",
    "observations of the radial density dependence of globular clusters show that they fall into two groups , with either a smoothly decreasing density profile with increasing radius , @xmath62 , or a sharp central peak and a more diffuse halo @xcite .",
    "the evidence suggests that a thermodynamic interpretation may be possible , i.e. perhaps the clusters can exist in different phases at observable times @xcite .",
    "here we investigated the dynamics of the gravitational phase transition in the @xmath9 model of a self - gravitating system in the mce in which the mass elements are thin , concentric , shells . in this idealized model , instead of regularizing the singularity of the newtonian potential",
    ", we simply fixed the square of the angular momentum of each shell . in section [ nbody ] , we showed that , in the mean field limit , the equilibrium states of this system correspond to those of the more realistic system of point masses when the same constraint is imposed . in an earlier work , we showed that a correspondence also exists under less restrictive circumstances @xcite .",
    "the constraint of constant @xmath9 for each shell , or particle , establishes a centrifugal barrier which prevents the occurrence of the gravothermal catastrophe , and induces a first order phase transition in both ce and mce @xcite .",
    "one important conclusion which can be reached from this study is that angular momentum exchange plays an important role in a self - gravitating system which alters the thermodynamic behavior .",
    "another is that it is not necessary to soften the singularity in the newtonian potential to obtain a transition .",
    "the effect of the singularity can be blocked by other mechanisms .",
    "this is especially relevant in stellar clusters , where the distance between stars is too great for softening to be important .",
    "if stellar systems can exist , or even approximate , different thermodynamic phases , the influence of the singularity needs to blocked , at least temporarily . in our earlier , mean field , study of a spherical system which permitted exchange , no transition was found and the gravothermal catastrophe could not be prevented in spite of the fact that both @xmath13 and @xmath1 were fixed . at this time it is not clear how this might occur .",
    "one possibility is that angular momentum exchange between stars may occur so slowly that , in the present epoch , thermodynamics could be influenced by an effective centrifugal barrier .",
    "since globular clusters are approximately spherical , this is worth investigating .",
    "another possibility is that stellar interactions with hard binaries in the cluster core may also establish a centrifugal barrier .",
    "these conjectures require further investigation .    in this work we used n - body dynamical simulation to verify the earlier mean - field predictions @xcite .",
    "our n - body simulations confirmed the mean - field phase transition , which was shifted and broadened due to finite size effects .",
    "we also verified that finite size scaling is in very good agreement with the observed shifting and rounding in the transition region .",
    "an interesting feature of the convergence to mft was the observation that agreement in the density with increasing @xmath7 was much slower near the system center for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "this appears to be a discreteness effect . for a small value of @xmath9 the density is changing rapidly due to the competition between the centrifugal barrier and the largely unscreened gravitational potential , which combine to form a very narrow minimum in the effective potential .",
    "because of discreteness effects , the mean local density can not change this rapidly in the dynamical simulation , and this was readily observable in the average population of the central bin .",
    "in addition to confirming agreement with mean field theory for the time average of physical quantities , such as the density and the kinetic and potential energies , we also studied fluctuations in density and kinetic energy , correlations in position , and the dynamical behavior of the system in each phase , the transition region , and at the critical point , i.e. properties which are not accessible from mft .",
    "these included virialization , relaxation to equilibrium , and the decay of fluctuations in kinetic energy through its autocorrelation function . in general , as @xmath7 becomes large , it is expected that the vlasov regime will be approached . in this regime @xmath152",
    "completely characterizes the system at each time .",
    "it was shown long ago that in a system with a smooth , bounded , potential , fluctuations and correlations decay in the vlasov limit @xcite . in the large @xmath7 scaling regime it is easy to show that the variance of fluctuations in both bin populations and total kinetic energy should decay as @xmath153 .",
    "we found this behavior over the complete range of population for the former , while a wide variation of power law exponents characterized the reduction of the kinetic energy variance depending on the thermodynamic state .",
    "this suggests that our simulations were not fully in the scaling regime for the smaller populations considered .",
    "this is not surprising , and was supported by the size of the spontaneous kinetic energy fluctuations as well as the @xmath7 dependence of the remaining dynamical quantities .    in the transition region ,",
    "strong corroborating evidence was obtained to support the ansatz that the system is fluctuating in time between the stable and metastable phase .",
    "first of all , relaxation to equilibrium as measured by the @xmath135 statistic takes longer and , at a given time , the fluctuations are much larger than those occurring away from the transition .",
    "second , virialization occurs on the same time scale as @xmath135 , whereas at low energy , the virialization takes place in about @xmath40 .",
    "fast virialization is also observed in other model systems which lack a transition , such as the planar sheet system@xcite , and point mass systems @xcite where it occurs in 50 - 100 dynamical times , long before relaxation to equilibrium has occurred .",
    "third , near the transition an extremely long time tail appears in the kinetic energy autocorrelation function , indicating that the system continues to feel the presence of the metastable phase .",
    "the lack of oscillation in @xmath154 suggests that a slow , diffusive , mode is dominating the linear relaxation .",
    "the observation that relaxation to equilibrium exhibits power law behavior was unanticipated and is crucial for understanding the system dynamics . in the astrophysics literature",
    "it is usual to define a relaxation time for gravitational evolution @xcite as the time it takes for a typical star to be sufficiently deflected that the change in its velocity is on the order of its mean .",
    "the standard result is @xmath155 .",
    "however , here we see that relaxation does not occur with a characteristic time , but rather is scale free , with @xmath156 .",
    "an open question is whether relaxation is scale free in higher dimension as well , e.g. for a point mass system .",
    "there are now two gravitational systems in which the existence of a phase transition has been demonstrated both by mean field theory and , to within finite scaling , dynamical simulation .",
    "the system of irrotational shells studied earlier @xcite and the system considered here share many similarities , but differ in one feature .",
    "each system is characterized by an additional parameter besides the energy : in the non - rotating model , the inner barrier radius @xmath157 plays the role of @xmath9 so its maximum density occurs at @xmath158 .",
    "each of these systems exhibits a transition in mce to a more centrally condensed phase as the energy is lowered .",
    "each system has a critical value of the new parameter above which the transition is not allowed .",
    "however , in the present system we find evidence of persistent fluctuations that develop long lived oscillations as @xmath7 is increased in mce , and local correlation in position near the system center .",
    "this suggests that collective oscillations may be occurring in the system .",
    "persistent oscillations were also observed in simulations of the planar sheet system for large @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we are currently modelling the system via dynamical simulation for the canonical ensemble .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing thermalizing collisions at the outer boundary .",
    "there are strong contrasts with the mce which we will report in a separate work .",
    "we also plan to use dynamical simulation to investigate the locally stable regime which arises when angular momentum exchange is allowed @xcite . in addition , we would like to suggest that vlasov dynamics may give insight into the collective behavior found in the fluid phase of the @xmath9 model ."
