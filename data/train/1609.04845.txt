    "an increase of the activity was observed by _ swift _ in x - rays , uv , and optical on 2015 december 22 , just a couple of days after the @xmath0-ray peak , suggesting a common mechanism for the multi - frequency variability during the flare .",

    "the two sed , with the high - energy bump modelled as an ec component of seed photons from a dust torus , could be modelled by changing both the electron distribution parameters and the magnetic field .",
