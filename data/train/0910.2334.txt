    "recently @xcite we have reported the @xmath1-evolution of the non - singlet structure functions at low and high @xmath0 as the complete solution of taylor - approximated dglap equation @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports the prediction of corresponding @xmath0-evolution .",
    "although the conventional wisdom on dglap evolution does not favour such a feature , such a possibility was reported @xcite sometime back .",
    "the main reason is that in this approach , the dglap equation is converted into a first order differential equation in two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) instead of only @xmath1 and has @xmath0 evolution as its natural outcome .",
    "there are , of course , various methods that have been developed recently like the brute - force @xcite , laguerre - polynomial @xcite and mellin - transformation @xcite etc . for numerical solution of dglap equation .",
    "all these methods have good numerical accuracy and computational efficiency , particularly the mellin - transformation one .",
    "all these solutions are very useful in the studies of a top - down scenario in order to determine the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "in addition , the matrix technique to get the numerical solution of the dglap evolution equation has also been proposed @xcite , which provides very good precision .    in recent years ,",
    "the study of parton distribution function ( pdf ) has itself become a topic of significant interest .",
    "the standard approach to the problem is based on a choice of a specific functional form in @xmath0 with a few parameters and to obtain fit of them by comparing the exact solution of the evolution equation with global data .",
    "based on this approach , several sets of pdf have been produced in recent years @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , shortcoming of such an approach has been pointed out : the form of parametrization is itself a source of bias . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "numerical method incorporating the notion of neural network @xcite has been suggested and pursued .",
    "alternative conventional models like statistical @xcite and chiral quark model @xcite have also received cosiderable attention in this respect .",
    "the present paper reports the analytical @xmath0-evolution of the non - singlet structure function in the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite which is much more general than that of earlier works @xcite and compares with the other approaches .",
