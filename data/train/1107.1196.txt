    "so far , the evolution between two phases seems to be fully reversible with no hysteresis possible .",
    "however , if the boson - fermi interaction strength @xmath6 is only moderately larger than the critical value where the normal phase ceases to be the ground state , a large grand canonical potential barrier separates the normal and bec - liquid states  similar to the vapor - water transition .",

    "the jump in the condensate may yield an interesting experimental signature for the first order quantum phase transition . for the particular case where the jump sets in exactly at the second order quantum phase transition in the metastable phase ,",
    "we indicate the state of the mixed phase by the two empty circles on the corresponding first order red lines in fig .",

    "it may be necessary to decrease @xmath6 beyond the critical value for the first order phase transition before the system jumps to the mixed phase .",
    "we observe that the transition between the two phases is path - dependent and thus we expect a typical hysteresis effect .",
    "interestingly , this hysteresis may be observed as a function of a varying magnetic field ( varying @xmath6 ) at fixed temperature ( e.g. @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is in this respect the same as a first order phase transition in magnets , with the jump in magnetization replaced by the jump in the conensate . by continuity",
