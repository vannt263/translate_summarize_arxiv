    "the relationships between black hole mass , @xmath5 , and large - scale host galaxy properties , such as bulge luminosity , @xmath6 , and stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that black holes play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is believed that supermassive black holes and galaxies grow in tandem , with the black hole governing the properties of galaxies through feedback mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling relations can also be established without black hole feedback , simply owing to the inherent averaging of properties that accompanies galaxy mergers @xcite . the main physical process that drives the black hole - galaxy relations remains poorly understood and it is unclear how important feedback - driven co - evolution is compared to a non - causal link associated with merger averaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a better understanding of the role that black holes play in galaxy evolution requires increasing the number of @xmath5 measurements , especially for low and high - mass black holes and over a larger range of galaxy types / properties .",
    "ngc 1277 is thought to harbor one of the most massive black holes in the universe @xcite .",
    "the nearby lenticular galaxy is a flattened , fast rotator with a cuspy surface brightness profile . of the @xmath080 dynamical black hole mass measurements currently on the black hole - galaxy relations @xcite , ngc 1277 shares the most similarities with ngc 4342 @xcite , ngc 1332 @xcite , and ngc 1271 @xcite .",
    "all of these early - type galaxies are significant positive outliers from the @xmath8 relation ( by at least 2@xmath3 ) , and have small sizes ( effective radii , @xmath9 , below 3 kpc ) and large stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath10 km s@xmath1 ) for their @xmath11-band luminosities ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "ngc 4486b @xcite and m60-ucd1 @xcite are also extreme outliers from @xmath13 with small sizes and elevated velocity dispersions for their galaxy luminosities .    the compact , high - dispersion galaxies like ngc 1277 are distinct from the typical giant elliptical galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) that are expected to contain the largest black holes and occupy the upper end of the black hole - galaxy relationships .",
    "giant ellipticals and bcgs instead have large sizes , surface brightness profiles with flat central cores , are pressure supported , and often are slow rotators @xcite . therefore measuring black hole masses in the compact , high - dispersion galaxies and",
    "the giant ellipticals / bcgs is helpful for searching for systematic deviations in the black hole scaling relationships between the two kinds of early - type galaxies .",
    "if such differences arise , this would suggest that the black holes and galaxies grew in different manners .",
    "galaxies like ngc 1277 , however , appear remarkably similar to the higher redshift massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "the @xmath142 quiescent galaxies are also small , have large velocity dispersions , exhibit disky structures ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are thought to grow into the present - day massive galaxies through a series of mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the resemblance to the @xmath142 red nuggets , the compact , high - dispersion galaxies could be relics that followed a different pathway than the local massive galaxies , instead experiencing passive evolution @xcite .",
    "if galaxies like ngc 1277 are local analogs of the @xmath142 quiescent galaxies and continue to show evidence for harboring over - massive black holes , then such galaxies may reflect a previous period when the local black hole scaling relations did not apply . instead , galaxies may have contained over - massive black holes at higher redshifts , suggesting that black hole growth precedes that of its host galaxy .",
    "indeed there could be hints that black holes at higher redshifts ( masses estimated in active galactic nuclei through the width of broad emission lines ) are over - massive at fixed galaxy mass compared to the local relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however there are also a number of studies that find essentially no change in the black hole scaling relations with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) and selection bias can lead to the false identification of evolution in @xmath15 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the black hole in ngc 1277 has several previous @xmath5 measurements . @xcite",
    "first reported the presence of a @xmath16 black hole using stellar - dynamical models and a long - slit spectroscopic observation from the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the total stellar mass of ngc 1277 is @xmath17 , and therefore the ratio between black hole mass and galaxy stellar mass is surprisingly high at 14% .",
    "@xcite also listed another five galaxies found through the het massive galaxy survey @xcite that could host similarly large black holes .",
    "such an extraordinary black hole mass for ngc 1277 , however , was called into question by @xcite , who compared dynamical models from n - body realizations to the same het kinematics .",
    "@xcite did not search for a best - fit model , but demonstrated that a @xmath18 black hole was sufficient to reproduce the observed kinematics , with the exception of the central @xmath19 measurements .",
    "more recently , @xcite used integral - field unit ( ifu ) observations from the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory and orbit - based dynamical models to confirm the mass measurement of @xcite , although they extend the bound of the uncertainty on the black hole mass measurement to possibly as low as @xmath20 .    while the above black hole mass determinations were made from analyzing the stellar kinematics of ngc 1277 , gas kinematics",
    "can also be used constrain @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite presented the detection of cold molecular gas arising from the nuclear dust disk based on iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) observations .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) emission was spatially unresolved , but the double - horned profile suggested an enclosed mass of @xmath0@xmath21 . depending on the stellar mass - to - light ratio assumed , both a @xmath0@xmath16 or a @xmath0@xmath18 black hole is able match the observed co(1 - 0 ) kinematics .    resolving the uncertainties in the ngc 1277 black hole mass requires high angular resolution observations that probe well within the region where the potential from the black hole dominates ( the black hole sphere of influence , @xmath22 ) . here",
    "we present new ifu observations from the 8 m gemini north telescope assisted by laser guide star adaptive optics ( ao ) and use orbit - based stellar dynamical models to revisit the black hole mass measurement of ngc 1277 . in section [ sec : mge ] , we review the luminous mass model adopted for ngc 1277 .",
    "we describe the ao spectroscopic observations in section [ sec : nifs_obs ] , the measurement of the high - angular resolution stellar kinematics in section [ sec : nifskin ] , and the corresponding psf model in section [ sec : psf ] .",
    "although the kinematics measured from the ao observations are used to constrain @xmath5 in our final model , we also run models that simultaneously fit to large - scale kinematics extending to several galaxy effective radii .",
    "these large - scale kinematics are discussed in section [ sec : largescalespectra ] .",
    "we describe the dynamical models in section [ sec : modeling ] and the results are given in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "a discussion of the revised @xmath5 in comparison to past work and implications from the location of ngc 1277 on the black hole - galaxy relations is provided in section [ sec : discussion ] , followed by concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a distance of 71 mpc , which is the hubble flow distance from the virgo + great attractor + shapley supercluster infall model @xcite for @xmath23 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . at this distance",
    ", 1  corresponds to 0.34 kpc .",
    "we further adopt @xmath26 35 ( 1.2 kpc ; @xcite ) and @xmath27 km s@xmath1 @xcite , which is also in agreement with the effective stellar velocity dispersion from large - scale ifu observations reported by @xcite .",
    "for the galaxy s bulge luminosity , we apply bulge - to - total ( @xmath28 ) ratios determined through photometric bulge - disk decompositions of a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xmath29-band image to the 2mass @xmath30 total luminosity @xcite . however , we note that a dynamical decomposition derived from the best - fit model of @xcite shows a rotating central round component , in addition to several other strongly rotating elements , making ngc 1277 s dynamical structure fundamentally different from bcgs and complicating the identification of a bulge",
    ". therefore , ngc 1277 s bulge luminosity is uncertain and we conservatively use @xmath31 in the @xmath11-band , which comes from a bulge - to - total ratio of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the bulge luminosity are taken from the photometric decomposition of @xcite , who find lower and upper limits of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is also consistent with a @xmath35 measured by @xcite .",
    "we used the two - dimensional ( 2d ) light distribution presented in @xcite , which was constructed from an archival _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) image .",
    "the acs data were originally acquired under program go-10546 with the f550 m filter .",
    "the observations have a total integration time of 2439 s , and a spatial scale of 005 pixel@xmath1 .",
    "the light distribution is described using the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) method @xcite , as such a representation can be analytically deprojected to determine the galaxy s intrinsic luminosity density .",
    "@xcite generated the ngc 1277 mge using galfit @xcite while accounting for a tiny tim psf model @xcite that was dithered in the same manner as the galaxy observations .",
    "the elliptical galaxy ngc 1278 , located 47  away in projection , was simultaneously fit with ngc 1277 , however other sources , including a nuclear dust disk , were masked and excluded from the fit .",
    "the dust disk has an apparent axis ratio of 0.3 , suggesting that the galaxy is viewed near edge - on , with an inclination angle of 75@xmath36 . as presented in supplemental table 1 of @xcite ,",
    "the ngc 1277 mge consists of 10 components , each with the same center and position angle of 92.7@xmath36 .",
    "the dispersion of the gaussians along the major axis extends from 006 to 17 , and the apparent flattening ranges between 0.4 - 0.9 .",
    "we obtained high angular resolution spectroscopy of ngc 1277 using the near - infrared integral field spectrometer ( nifs ; @xcite ) with the alttitude conjugate adaptive optics for the infrared @xcite system on the gemini north telescope .",
    "the observations were taken as part of program gn-2011b - q-27 over the course of four nights , spanning from 2012 oct 30 to 2012 dec 27 .",
    "we observed ngc 1277 using 600 s object - sky - object exposures with the @xmath37 filter and @xmath11 grating centered on @xmath38 @xmath39 m .",
    "for the galaxy observations we used the `` open - loop '' focus model @xcite and the bright , compact nucleus as the tip - tilt star .",
    "we further acquired nifs observations of a nearby star to measure the point spread function ( psf ) and a0  v stars for telluric correction .",
    "we reduced the nifs data using iraf tasks in the gemini / nifs package version 1.11 .",
    "the reduction followed the procedure outlined in the nifs example processing scripts .",
    "the main steps included sky subtraction , flat fielding , bad pixel and cosmic - ray cleaning , spectral and spatial rectification , telluric correction , and the creation of a data cube .",
    "individual data cubes of the galaxy were summed along the wavelength axis to generate flux maps , which there then cross - correlated in order to determine the relative spatial offsets between cubes .",
    "twelve galaxy exposures , totaling 2 hours - on source , were aligned and combined to produce the final data cube composed of a spectral dimension and @xmath40 and @xmath41 spatial dimensions with a scale of 005 pixel@xmath1 .",
    "the psf observations were reduced in a similar manner .",
    "we also retrieved nifs @xmath11-band observations of k and m giant / supergiant stars , and the supporting calibration files , from the gemini science archive .",
    "the twelve stars were originally observed under programs gn-2006a - c-11 , gn-2006b - q-107 , gn-2007a - q-62 , and gn-2010a - q-112 .",
    "we followed the nifs data reduction steps described above , but additionally extracted a one - dimensional spectrum for each star .",
    "we then rebinned the template spectra to the same wavelength range and sampling , and shifted the stars to rest .",
    "nearly all of the stars are part of the nifs spectral template library v2.0 @xcite , however we chose to reduce the observations from scratch so that our template spectra would have a similar continuum shape as the observed galaxy spectra .",
    "currently , the spectra associated with the nifs spectral template library have been continuum - divided on a star - by - star basis .",
    "from the nifs data cube , we extracted spectra over a range of spatial locations and used the voronoi binning method @xcite to determine the optimal balance between signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and bin size .",
    "we measured the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) in each spatial bin using the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) method @xcite , parametrizing the losvd in terms of the radial velocity ( @xmath29 ) , the velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) , and the next two gauss - hermite moments ( @xmath42 , @xmath19 ) that correspond to asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian .",
    "an optimal stellar template in each spatial bin was constructed from a library of twelve stars observed with nifs .",
    "the library includes k0m5 giant stars , a k5 supergiant , and an m0 supergiant .",
    "slight differences in the continuum shape and the equivalent width between the losvd - broadened optimal template and the observed galaxy spectrum were corrected for using an additive contant and a first degree multiplicative legendre polynomial .",
    "we fit between observed wavelengths of @xmath43 @xmath39 m , and measured the kinematics primarily from the @xmath44co and @xmath45co stellar features .",
    "we chose this particular wavelength range to avoid artifacts in the outer spatial bins near the @xmath46co bandhead and to avoid the absorption line , as were unable to achieve satisfactory fits due to the lack of dwarf stars in our template library @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , we excluded the feature contained within our fitting region .",
    "we further excluded an artifact near the @xmath45co bandhead .    using the results of an initial fit to the observed galaxy spectrum in each spatial bin , we ran monte carlo simulations with 100 realizations . during each realization , we added random gaussian noise to the best - fit model , such that the level of the perturbation is given by the standard deviation of model residuals .",
    "we set the ppxf penalization to zero to produce realistic uncertainties . from the resulting distribution for each gauss - hermite moment in each of the spatial bins , we calculated the mean and standard deviation , which we took to be the kinematic value and 1@xmath3 uncertainty .",
    "we tested the robustness of the nifs kinematics by modifying the details of how the kinematics were extracted .",
    "nearly all spatial bins have kinematics consistent at the 1@xmath3 level ( all are consistent within 2@xmath3 ) with those measured using various combinations of degree @xmath47 additive / multiplicative polynomials , as well as simply a multiplicative order 1 polynomial .",
    "similar kinematics are also measured when including the feature , and when fitting over a longer wavelength region that extends to @xmath48 @xmath39 m and includes the third major co bandhead .",
    "moreover , we tested keeping the relative mix of stars making up the optimal template fixed between spatial bins , but allowing the coefficients of the additive and multiplicative polynomial to vary .",
    "this produced consistent results as our default method of fitting for the optimal stellar template in each spatial bin .",
    "as a final step , we point - symmetrize the nifs kinematics using the procedure in @xcite .",
    "we find that galaxy is rotating with velocities of @xmath49 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion increases sharply to 551 km s@xmath1 at the center from values of @xmath0275 km s@xmath1 in the outer nifs spatial bins .",
    "as is expected for an axisymmetric system , we find an anti - correlation between the @xmath42 and @xmath29 maps",
    ". we also observe a slight peak in @xmath19 at the nucleus to values of @xmath00.05 . the median error for @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath42 , and @xmath19 over the 105 spatial bins is 7 km s@xmath1 , 9 km s@xmath1 , 0.02 , and 0.02 , respectively . taking the s / n to be the median flux divided by the standard deviation of model residuals from",
    "the initial fits with ppxf , we find s / n values of 69@xmath50164 , with a median value of 92 . examples of the spectral fitting at three spatial locations are shown in figure [ fig : nifsspec ] , and the kinematics prior to symmetrization are given in table [ tab : nifskin ] .",

    "we modeled the nifs psf as the sum of two concentric , circular 2d gaussians .",
    "the weights and dispersions of the components were determined by comparing the galaxy data cube , after summing along the wavelength axis , to the mge model of the _ hst _ image convolved with the nifs psf model .",
    "the comparison was also used to determine the center of the nifs aperture .",
    "the nifs psf was best described by an inner gaussian with a dispersion of 007 and a relative weight of 0.65 and an outer gaussian with a dispersion of 040 and a weight of 0.35 . using more than two gaussians to model the psf produced components with negligible weights .    since the nifs psf is a vital input into the dynamical models when measuring @xmath5 , we also estimated the psf by examining nifs observations of a nearby star .",
    "using galfit , we found that the sum of four concentric , circular gaussians provided a good description of the collapsed data cube .",
    "the best - fit model was composed of gaussians weighted by 0.14 , 0.31 , 0.34 , and 0.20 with dispersions of 004 , 008 , 029 , and 072 , respectively .",

    "the nifs kinematics are the primary data used to constrain the ngc 1277 black hole mass in section [ sec : results ] . however , we also tested running models that include large - scale stellar kinematics measured from het low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; @xcite ) data and spectroscopy obtained at the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory using the postdam multi aperture spectrograph ( pmas ; @xcite ) in the pmas fiber pack ( ppak ; @xcite ) mode . the het and ppak observations , stellar kinematics ( measured out to @xmath03 @xmath9 ) , and psf models have been previously presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although we refer the reader to these publications for additional details , we briefly review the relevant information below .",
    "the het observations were taken with a 1-wide slit , the g2 grating , and 2@xmath512 binning , which provides an instrumental dispersion of 108 km s@xmath1 and a wavelength coverage of @xmath52  .",
    "a single 900 s exposure was obtained along the galaxy major axis . after constructing 31 spatial bins ,",
    "the stellar kinematics were measured with ppxf using the the miles template library @xcite and a degree 25 multiplicative polynomial and an order 5 additive polynomial . by comparing the reconstructed slit image to the ngc 1277 mge model and parameterizing the psf as the sum of two gaussians , weights of 0.66 and 0.34 and dispersions of 062 and 280 , respectively , were measured .    for the ppak observations ,",
    "two 900 s science exposures at three pointings ( totaling 1.5 hours on - source ) were acquired using the medium - resolution v1200 grating . with this setup ,",
    "the useful spectral range is @xmath53   and the spectral resolution corresponds to @xmath54 at @xmath55  .",

    "the ppak psf is described by the sum of two gaussians with dispersions of 121 and 244 with weights of 0.75 and 0.25 , respectively .",

    "is constructed from the combination of the black hole , the stars , and a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ; @xcite ) dark matter halo .",
    "the intrinsic stellar mass distribution is found by deprojecting the surface brightness model in section [ sec : mge ] assuming an oblate axisymmetric shape , an inclination angle of 75@xmath36 , and a @xmath29-band stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath56 ) that remains constant with radius .",
    "ngc 1277 appears very flattened , is a fast rotator , and does nt show signs of kinematic twists  all of which support the assumption of axisymmetry .",
    "the inclination angle is the same as the one assumed in previous studies of ngc 1277 @xcite , and is set by the nuclear dust disk in the optical _ hst _ image . in our models ,",
    "the nfw halo is described by the concentration parameter ( @xmath57 ) , which we set to 10 , and the fraction of dark matter relative to the stellar mass ( @xmath58 ) , which we set to values of 10 , 100 , and 1000 , corresponding to halo virial masses of @xmath0@xmath59 , @xmath0@xmath60 , and @xmath0@xmath61 .",

    "the orbits are integrated in the potential , and after accounting for the psf and aperture binning , weights are assigned to the orbits through a non - negative least squares process such that their combined properties match the intrinsic and projected stellar masses along with the observed kinematics .",
    "we required that the surface brightness and three - dimensional mass distributions be fit to an accuracy of 1% .",

    "the best - fit model is able to reproduce the dramatic rise in the stellar velocity dispersion at the nucleus and the slight increase in @xmath19 at the center .",

    "if instead no adjustments are made to the observed nifs kinematics , with the exception of subtracting off the offsets in the odd gauss - hermite moments ( e.g. , the galaxy s recessional velocity ) , then we measure a black hole mass of @xmath76 and a @xmath29-band stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath77 . hence ,",
    "@xmath5 increases by 18% and @xmath56 decreases by 5% .",
    "the best - fit model to the unsymmetrized nifs kinematics has a reduced @xmath65 of 2.9 .    finally , the nifs kinematics appear to be sensitive to the adopted ppxf continuum - correction model .",
    "we measured the stellar kinematics by comparing spectra of k and m giant and supergiant stars to the ngc 1277 spectra .",
    "since the stars were also observed with nifs , their spectra have a similar shape as the galaxy spectra ; however , minor adjustments to the templates are needed to account for differences in the co bandhead equivalent widths and for reddening / imperfect flux calibration . in order to provide a better match to the observed galaxy spectra , we used additive / multiplicative legendre polynomials with ppxf .",
    "as described in section [ sec : nifskin ] , we selected an additive degree 0 and multiplicative degree 1 polynomial , and allowed ppxf to solve for the best - fit coefficients simultaneously with the gauss - hermite moments . an additive degree 0 and multiplicative degree 1 polynomial produced a good fit to the ngc 1277 observations , and the use of other low - order polynomials yield consistent kinematics .    adopting higher - order polynomials resulted in slightly better fits to the galaxy spectra , but generally lower stellar velocity dispersions , especially at the nucleus .",
    "notably , extracting the nifs kinematics using a multiplicative degree 2 polynomial resulted in velocity dispersions that were lower by as much as 36 km s@xmath1 compared to when an additive degree 0 with a multiplicative degree 1 polynomial were utilized .",
    "other combinations of multiplicative degree @xmath78 polynomials with no additive contribution , or with additive degree @xmath47 polynomials , produced consistent kinematics as the multiplicative degree 2 polynomial case .",
    "therefore , we tested the effect on @xmath5 when fitting to point - symmetrized nifs kinematics extracted with an order 2 multiplicative polynomial .",
    "we found that the black hole mass decreased to @xmath79 , or by 14% , and the @xmath29-band stellar mass - to - light ratio increased to @xmath80 , or by 8% .",
    "the final uncertainties are determined by adding in quadrature the change in the @xmath5 and @xmath56 from each of the three tests above and the 1@xmath3 statistical errors from the fiducial model grid .",
    "this results in fractional errors of 32% and 17% on @xmath5 and @xmath56 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the systematics associated with the nifs kinematics and nifs psf input into the stellar - dynamical models dominate over the formal 1@xmath3 model fitting uncertainty . in terms of other common systematic sources of error that plague stellar - dynamical measurements , by fitting to just the nifs kinematics we have limited mass degeneracies with the galaxy s dark halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and uncertainties associated with the assumption of a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , owing to the presence of the nuclear dust disk , uncertainty in the viewing orientation is minimal , unlike some past stellar - dynamical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dust disk , however , may be problematic for construction of the luminous mass model in section [ sec : mge ] .",
    "we conservatively masked the dust when generating the mge model , but acknowledge that if the mge under - predicts the nuclear stellar mass then the black hole mass would be overestimated .",
    "large - scale data is commonly used to complement high angular resolution spectroscopy in order to better constrain the stellar mass - to - light ratio and orbital distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nifs kinematics extend out to a radius of 13 ( 442 pc ) , or @xmath00.4 @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the nifs data not only resolve the black hole sphere of influence , but also probe the region where the stars begin to dominate the potential .",
    "it is encouraging that our fiducial model presented at the beginning of section [ sec : results ] largely reproduces the observed het kinematics over the radial range of the nifs data , as can be seen in figure [ fig : nifsvshetvsppak ] .",
    "the predictions from this best - fit model , constrained by only the nifs kinematics , are consistent with the velocity , velocity dispersion , and @xmath42 het measurements , and only deviate from the central @xmath19 het values by about 1.5 times the measurement uncertainty .",
    "although the fiducial model is in fair agreement with the het observations , figure [ fig : nifsvshetvsppak ] shows that the same model is worse at matching the observed ppak kinematics .",
    "the predictions from the best - fit model constrained only by the nifs data are consistent with the velocity and @xmath42 ppak measurements , but over - estimate the central ppak velocity dispersions by about nine times the measurement errors , in addition to under - predicting the inner @xmath19 ppak values by twice the uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we also ran dynamical models that fit to the combination of nifs and het kinematics , as well as to the combination of nifs and ppak kinematics , continuing to sample the same dark halos described in section [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "we recovered best - fit values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 with a reduced @xmath65 of 0.8 when fitting all 31 het spatial bins , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 with a reduced @xmath65 of 0.8 when excluding three outer bins because their dispersions are below the het / lrs instrumental resolution . instead if dynamical models are fit to the combination of the nifs and ppak kinematics , we infer @xmath87 and @xmath88 with a reduced @xmath65 of 0.8 .",
    "in summary , we find that the black hole mass and mass - to - light ratio measured from models fit to nifs+het and nifs+ppak agree with the results from our fiducial model , fit to nifs only , after accounting for systematics associated with the nifs kinematics and psf .",
    "below we compare our black hole mass measurement to the previous mass determinations in the literature and discuss the implications of ngc 1277 s location on the black hole@xmath50host galaxy relations .      with @xmath89 and @xmath90 km s@xmath1 , the nifs observations probe well within the black hole sphere of influence of 06 .",
    "previous stellar - dynamical work using seeing - limited data from long - slit het observations and ifu ppak observations found @xmath91 @xcite and @xmath92 @xcite , respectively .",
    "neither study , however , quantified the impact of possible systematic effects on the ngc 1277 black hole mass .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the het kinematics presented in @xcite could be nearly reproduced with a @xmath93 black hole . a rather small deviation between the @xmath93 black hole model and the het kinematics occurs for the innermost @xmath19 measurements , such that the model under - predicts the observed values by about twice the uncertainty , which is similar to our best - fit model .",
    "given the possibility of spurious kinematic measurements due to issues like template mismatch , @xcite advocated for the use of 3@xmath3 confidence levels for a more conservative estimate of the @xmath5 uncertainty . for stellar - dynamical models",
    "fit to the het kinematics , the 3@xmath3 uncertainty corresponds to @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite opted to report 3@xmath3 statistical uncertainties as a careful way in which to assign errors to @xmath5 and @xmath56 .",
    "they fit to both ppak and het observations simultaneously to determine @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "they comment though that the central dispersion and @xmath19 measurements from the ppak data are systematically lower than the inner values from the het data , which could be due to a number of reasons ( e.g. , the use of different stellar libraries , different spectral fitting regions , different spatial resolutions , etc . ) .",
    "since the ppak data provide an independent check of the validity of the het kinematics , @xcite additionally fit orbit - based models to only the ppak kinematics , finding a lower limit of @xmath98 , which they view as a very conservative bound on the ngc 1277 black hole mass",
    ".    therefore , our black hole mass of @xmath99 and @xmath29-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath100 are in agreement with the above conservative limits from @xcite and @xcite . although it is tempting to assume that the smaller black hole mass inferred from the nifs data is the result of smaller central @xmath19 values as suggested by figure [ fig : nifsvshetvsppak ] , much of the inferred black hole mass is being driven by the lower order moments , and not @xmath19 .",
    "if dynamical models are fit to only the nifs velocity , velocity dispersion , and @xmath42 measurements , we recover a best - fit black hole mass consistent with @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , if an artificial constant is added to the observed nifs @xmath19 values ( we tested adding an offset of 0.03 and 0.06 ) , no change in the black hole mass outside of the quoted uncertainties is observed .",
    "a more rigorous comparison ultimately requires an attempt to quantify some possible systematics that affect @xmath5 and @xmath56 derived from the low spatial resolution data .",
    "for example , the het and ppak kinematics from @xcite and @xcite extend to @xmath03 @xmath9 ( @xmath010 ) , and both studies assumed that the stellar mass - to - light ratio remains constant over this radial range .",
    "@xcite argued against a varying mass - to - light ratio based on a lack of color gradients in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging , but @xcite find a possible increase in @xmath56 from @xmath102 at @xmath05to @xmath103 at @xmath01  by measuring gravity sensitive absorption lines in optical / near - infrared spectra of ngc 1277 and assuming a bimodal initial mass function . since the large - scale het and ppak spectroscopy",
    "do not resolve the black hole sphere of influence , the assumptions made about the mass - to - light ratio will have a significant impact on @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if @xmath56 is actually larger at the center than that assumed by @xcite and @xcite , then their inferred @xmath5 is overestimated .",
    "the factor of @xmath03 difference in the best - fit black hole masses between this work and the prior stellar - dynamical studies is large .",
    "however , incorporating any identifiable systematics into the error budget may make the @xmath5 and @xmath56 measurements from the ao spectroscopy and the large - scale spectroscopy come into better agreement than it currently appears based simply on the 1@xmath3 model fitting uncertainties .",
    "we have done this in section [ sec : results ] for @xmath5 and @xmath56 derived from the ao observations ; it is notable that the uncertainties associated with the extraction of the nifs kinematics and the nifs psf alone dominate over the 1@xmath3 statistical errors .",
    "in addition to above stellar - dynamical black hole mass measurements , recently @xcite presented cold molecular gas kinematics from low angular resolution radio observations of ngc 1277 .",
    "@xcite modeled the molecular gas distribution from the @xmath01  resolution and @xmath025 resolution configurations of pdbi as a nuclear ring and as an exponential disk with an inclination angle of @xmath104 .",
    "since the co(1 - 0 ) emission was spatially unresolved , the black hole mass was not well constrained and they found that the double - horned co profile was consistent with both @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the black hole mass measurement presented here is consistent with constraints from molecular gas kinematics , and it would be interesting to compare to higher angular resolution gas kinematics . currently , there are a very limited number of meaningful comparisons between stellar and gas - dynamical black hole mass measurement methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      the smaller inferred black hole mass from this work does not change the main result that ngc 1277 harbors an over - massive black hole for the galaxy s luminosity , although ngc 1277 is now more consistent with the @xmath15 relation . in figure [ fig : mbhrels ] , we plot ngc 1277 on the black hole - galaxy relations .",
    "the black hole mass expected from @xmath8 is @xmath107 for @xmath11-band bulge luminosities between @xmath108 @xcite , while the mass expected from @xmath109 is @xmath110 depending on whether the @xcite or @xcite calibration is used .",
    "therefore , ngc 1277 is an order of magnitude above the mass expected from the @xmath13 relation . the model with a @xmath111 black hole , which is the mass expected from @xmath13 when conservatively using the galaxy s total luminosity , is clearly a poor match to the nifs observations and under - predicts the strong rise in the nuclear velocity dispersion and the minor increase in central @xmath19 values , as can be seen in figure [ fig : nifscomparemodels ] .",
    "in contrast , the model with a larger black hole of @xmath106 , which is the best - fit mass from @xcite , clearly over - estimates the nifs central velocity dispersion and @xmath19 values .",
    "ngc 1277 is similar to the galaxies highlighted in @xcite as `` black hole monsters '' , namely ngc 4486b , ngc 4342 , and ngc 1332 , as well as the recently studied galaxies m60-ucd1 and ngc 1271 .",
    "in particular , ngc 4342 , ngc 1332 , and ngc 1271 appear most like ngc 1277 .",
    "all of these early - type galaxies are small , are outliers from the faber - jackson relation ( i.e. , show high velocity dispersions for their luminosities ) , are rotating , and are positively offset from @xmath13 but consistent with @xmath15 .",
    "although less certain , there are hints that the galaxies mrk 1216 @xcite and sdss j151741.75 - 004217.6 @xcite are also offset from @xmath13 .",
    "we note that this behavior could differ from that observed for bcgs , as new measurements @xcite may indicate that the @xmath112 relationship saturates , such that @xmath5 becomes independent of @xmath7 at large masses , but that bcgs continue to follow @xmath13 @xcite . if compact , high - dispersion galaxies like ngc 1277 and bcgs indeed exhibit different scaling relations , that would suggest that the black holes / galaxies grew via different pathways .",
    "there are a few potential explanations for the presence of these over - massive black holes .",
    "one interesting possibility is that the galaxies are relics of the @xmath113 quiescent galaxies , passively evolving since that epoch .",
    "@xcite argue this is the case for ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 , citing uniform old stellar populations ( ages @xmath11410 gyr ) and small sizes that make the galaxies outliers from the local mass - size relation of @xcite .",
    "an equivalent picture was previously discussed by @xcite , who also find uniform old stellar ages for ngc 1277 , make note of the galaxy s massive and compact nature , and point to an identical stellar mass density to the massive , high-@xmath4 passive galaxies as another indication that ngc 1277 is a relic galaxy .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the compact galaxies took a different evolutionary path than the one assumed for local massive galaxies , skipping a phase in which galaxies grow in size and mildly in mass via mergers after @xmath142 .",
    "most recently , @xcite echoed an analogous sentiment based on the analysis of illustris simulations .",
    "likewise , @xcite proposed that a majority of black hole growth occurred before @xmath143 and that the accretion of gas and stars dictates whether there is subsequent evolution of the compact bulges .",
    "in other words , maybe galaxies like ngc 1277 are positive outliers from the local @xmath13 relation because they reflect a previous time when galaxies harbored over - massive black holes , and the growth of host galaxies had yet to catch up .",
    "a second explanation for the over - massive black holes is that these objects are simply unusual , and are found in the tails of a distribution between black hole masses and host galaxy properties . with the limited number of dynamical measurements for @xmath11410@xmath115 black holes currently available , the form and scatter of the relations in this high - mass regime",
    "are not well established @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assess how much these compact , high - dispersion galaxies in reality deviate from the local @xmath13 relation .",
    "another way in which to create an over - massive black hole is through tidal stripping .",
    "this is believed to the be the case for m60-ucd1 @xcite , however ngc 1277 does not show signs of recent interactions and the isophotes from the _ hst _ image appear regular without asymmetries .",
    "another idea was put forth by @xcite , who examine the possibility that the black hole was ejected from the bcg of perseus , wandered about the cluster core , and was subsequently captured by ngc 1277 .",
    "this , however , requires a series of rare events , and the scenario has become more unlikely as we now have confirmed another over - massive black hole @xcite and have a number of other candidates @xcite from galaxies also located in the perseus cluster .",
    "more dynamical mass measurements of the black holes in galaxies like ngc 1277 are needed , especially if such objects turn out to be the relics of higher redshift quiescent galaxies .",
    "roughly 1 in 100 of the @xmath4@xmath02 passive galaxies survive until today @xcite .",
    "although such relics are thought to be rare and are not representative of the local galaxy population , dynamically measuring @xmath5 in a significant sample will provide insight into the growth of black holes with their host galaxies over time .",
    "the het massive galaxy survey @xcite has uncovered about a dozen galaxies with sizes , dispersions , and luminosities similar to ngc 1277 .",
    "we currently have high angular resolution imaging and spectroscopy for half of these objects , and are working on acquiring secure @xmath5 measurements .",
    "we have presented @xmath11-band spectroscopic observations of the nearby s0 galaxy ngc 1277 obtained with gemini / nifs assisted by ao .",
    "the observations allow us to map out the stellar kinematics well with the black hole s gravitational sphere of influence , and when combined with high resolution _",
    "hst _ imaging , we are able to place strong constraints on the mass of the central black hole . we find that @xmath81 .",
    "these error bars reflect the 1@xmath3 statistical uncertainties in combination with systematics associated with the nifs kinematic measurements and the psf model .",
    "we elect to fit orbit - based dynamical models to only the nifs kinematics in order to limit other common systematic effects known to affect black hole mass measurements ; namely degeneracies between the dark halo / the mass - to - light ratio / the black hole mass and the assumption of a stellar mass - to - light ratio that remains constant with radius .",
    "we note , however , that fitting dynamical models to the nifs kinematics in combination with the large - scale het kinematics , and in combination with the wide - field ifu ppak kinematics , produces a black hole mass consistent with @xmath116 .",
    "the black hole mass measurement presented here is a factor of @xmath03 smaller than the best - fit masses previously reported by @xcite and @xcite , both of which were determined from stellar - dynamical modeling of large - scale , seeing - limited spectroscopy .",
    "neither study explicitly explored the effect of systematics on @xmath5 , which could significantly increase the range of plausible black holes masses . when instead considering the conservative lower 3@xmath3 limit of @xmath117 from @xcite and of @xmath118 from @xcite , our result is consistent with the previous studies .",
    "furthermore , our mass measurement agrees with the constraints found from rotating molecular gas .",
    "@xcite presented unresolved co(1 - 0 ) emission arising from the nuclear dust disk in ngc 1277 , and found that both a @xmath0@xmath93 and a @xmath0@xmath119 black hole are capable of reproducing the double - horned profile .    with @xmath81 ,",
    "the black hole in ngc 1277 is one of the largest detected to date .",
    "ngc 1277 remains a positive outlier on the @xmath13 relation , but is consistent with @xmath15 .",
    "ngc 1277 is thought to be a relic of the @xmath4@xmath02 massive quiescent galaxies @xcite , and could suggest that galaxies contained over - massive black holes at earlier epochs , such that the growth of black holes precedes the growth of their host galaxies .",
