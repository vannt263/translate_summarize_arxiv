    "in the field of condensed matter , many systems can be modeled using a quantum subsystem coupled to a classical bath . when energy is free to be exchanged between the subsystem and the bath , the resulting dynamics is known to be non - adiabatic .",
    "this type of dynamics is very difficult to simulate due to the quantum back - reaction of the subsystem onto the bath  @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical methods have been proposed for the calculation of non - adiabatic dynamics on a computer , the most common of which are so - called surface hopping schemes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , an approach based on the quantum - classical liouville equation has been applied with success to condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows one to construct a proper formulation of the statistical mechanics of quantum - classical systems  @xcite which can also be generalised to situations where the bath follows a non - hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a simple and efficient algorithm suited for the computer simulation of the quantum - classical liouville equation is the sequential short - time propagation ( sstp ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the sstp algorithm is based on a first order expansion in time of the dyson form of the quantum - classical propagator and , when combined with the momentum - jump approximation  @xcite , leads to a representation of non - adiabatic dynamics in terms of piecewise adiabatic trajectories of the bath coordinates , interspersed with stochastic transitions between the energy levels of the subsystem . despite the similarities to a recently introduced scheme based on a trotter decomposition of the quantum - classical propagator  @xcite ,",
    "the basic version of the sstp algorithm is not as stable at long times and it also displays problems in the region of intermediate and strong coupling to the bath , as illustrated by the results of calculations on the spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "the growth of the statistical error in time can be mitigated by means of filtering schemes .",
    "one such a scheme  @xcite is essentially based on establishing a cutting threshold of the observable when it becomes too large because of the accumulation in time of the sampling weight .",
    "such a scheme will be referred to in the following as the observable - cutting scheme .",
    "more recently , another filtering algorithm , which is based on a generalised sampling of non - adiabatic transitions , has been proposed .",
    "such an algorithm has been proven to dramatically reduce the statistical error at long time  @xcite .",
    "this other scheme will be called in this paper as the transition - filtering scheme .    in this work ,",
    "we use the sstp algorithm to integrate the quantum - classical liouville equation for the spin - boson model and perform a comparison of the performances of the two filtering schemes discussed above .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the sstp algorithm used in conjunction with the combination of the observable - cutting and the transition - filtering schemes performs as well as the trotter algorithm also in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes . this result is desirable",
    "since the sstp algorithm is easier to implement than its trotter counterpart , especially when the number of quantum states greater than two must be considered .",
    "this promises to be advantageous when studying quantum systems which are more complex than the spin - boson model .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",

    "this shift is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 the symbol @xmath45 is the unit vector associated with the coupling vector in the multidimensional space of all the particle coordinates .",
    "note that in the above , we have assumed that all the masses are the same , however , it is a simple matter to extend this to a system where the masses are different . if we expand the square root on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : mom - shift ] ) , we obtain the approximated form for the momentum shift rule @xmath46 note that while the exact momentum shift in equation ( [ eq : mom - shift ] ) exactly conserves the energy , the approximated form in equation ( [ eq : approx - mom - shift ] ) does not . in our calculations",
    ", only the exact form of the momentum shift was used .",
    "the sstp algorithm is derived upon considering the evolution along a quantum - classical trajectory given by the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : quant - class - evolution ] ) as a series of sequential small time steps @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the short - time expression of the quantum - classical propagator @xmath48_{{\\alpha\\alpha',\\beta\\beta'}}$ ] is approximated to linear order in time as @xmath49 in the limit @xmath50 , the concatenation of the short time steps exactly reproduces the dyson integral expansion of the operator @xmath51 for finite times  @xcite .",
    "the computational evaluation of each single step @xmath47 can be evaluated upon considering the short time propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : short - time - propagator ] ) as a stochastic operator .",
    "the action of the transition operator @xmath52 is then sampled using a suitable transition probability .",
    "this transition probability is not uniquely fixed but has to be chosen following the criteria of physical reasonability and computational efficiency .",
    "the transition probability is defined as the probability of a non - adiabatic transition occurring in a time interval @xmath47 . a basic choice for this probability is given by @xmath53 this transition probability then defines the probability of no transition occurring in the same time interval as @xmath54 when at time step @xmath55 in the calculation the transition probability is sampled , and a transition occurs , the observable is multiplied by a factor of @xmath56 . if no transition occurs , then the observable",
    "is multiplied by a factor of @xmath57 . the @xmath58 term introduced when a transition occurs originates from the action of the @xmath52 operator .",
    "the concatenation of these factors result in a weight in the observable which causes an error in the result at longer times .",
    "we thus need to sample non - adiabatic transitions in such a way that minimises this statistical error .",
    "the first method for reducing statistical error tackles the problem directly .",
    "it is a simple but effective approach .",
    "as mentioned above , the magnitude of the weight , which is used to calculate the observable , grows with time and causes the value of the observable to grow , leading to large statistical error . knowing this",
    ", we can introduce a threshold value @xmath59 which sets an upper bound to the magnitude of the weight .",
    "if at a stage @xmath60 in the calculation of a trajectory we have that the magnitude of the weight @xmath61 becomes larger than @xmath59 , it is instead set to the value of @xmath59 .",
    "mathematically , we can write this as : @xmath62 note that this cutting only affects the magnitude of the weight , the sign remains the same .",
    "this cutting ensures that the weight can never grow to values where a single trajectory is having an overly large effect on the value of the observable .",
    "consequently , we do not see the large statistical error in the result at longer times . while effective , however , this scheme does not have any physical basis , unlike the transition filtering scheme .",
    "another approach to the reduction of the statistical error has been recently proposed in refs .",
    "essentially , it is based on filtering out those non - adiabatic transitions which would lead to too big a change in the momenta . in order to illustrate such an approach",
    ", it is useful to recall the form of the energy variation because of a non - adiabatic transition calculated using an approximate form of the momentum - shift rule : @xmath63 where @xmath64 . upon introducing the parameter @xmath65 and the weight @xmath66",
    ", one can define a generalised transition probability @xmath67 this in turn defines the probability of no transition occurring as @xmath68 the weight @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 the transition probabilities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prob - gen ] ) and  ( [ eq : prob - no - gen ] ) allow one to control the amplitude of energy fluctuations that would be caused by an approximate momentum shift through the use of the numerical parameter @xmath65 . whenever a non - adiabatic transition would cause a virtual energy fluctuation that is larger than @xmath65 ,",
    "the transition probability becomes zero , and no transition can occur .",
    "this generalisation of the basic sampling scheme allows non - adiabatic transitions to occur only in regions where the approximate momentum shift rule causes small virtual variation of the energy of the system : this happens when the change in the momentum is not too big .",
    "such a scheme has been proven numerically to be very efficient in reducing statistical error at long times  @xcite .    since each of the above filtering techniques approach the statistical error problem from different angles , it is interesting to combine them within a single simulation algorithms .",
    "according to such an idea , in each simulation , the non - adiabatic transitions are filtered according to the transition - filtering scheme , using the parameter @xmath65 , in addition to the observable being cut when it grows too large , according to the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "our numerical study was performed on the spin - boson model  @xcite , which can be considered as a paradigmatic example for quantum dynamics  @xcite for which the adiabatic states are known exactly .",

    ", we have set the spin in an excited state at @xmath75 , and the quantum harmonic modes are at thermal equilibrium , with no coupling before @xmath75 .",
    "after @xmath75 , the coupling is switched on , and we calculate the observable @xmath76 , or population difference of the system",

    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] displays the weak coupling result for the combined filtering scheme . in this case we again see the excellent agreement with the influence functional results , but the error bars are smaller than the points for the entire simulation time .",
    "moreover , the calculation remains stable for longer times  @xcite than those obtained in previously published results .",

    "our results are also as good as those obtained with the trotter - based algorithm for the simulation of the quantum - classical liouville equation  @xcite . however , since the sstp algorithm is easier to implement for systems which have a number of quantum states greater than two , our proposal of the combined filtering scheme promises to be advantageous for more complex numerical studies of non - adiabatic dynamics .",
