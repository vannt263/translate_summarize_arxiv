    "multiple scattering by randomly placed particles frustrates the passage of light through ` opaque ' materials such as turbid water , white paint , and egg shells .",
    "thanks to the theoretical work of dorokhov @xcite , barnes and pendry et al .",
    "@xcite , and others @xcite , as well as the breakthrough experiments of vellekoop and mosk @xcite and others @xcite , we now understand that even though a normally incident wavefront will barely propagate through a thick slab of such media @xcite , a small number of eigen - wavefronts exist that exhibit a transmission coefficient close to one and hence propagate through the slab without significant loss .    in highly scattering random media composed of non - absorbing scatterers , these ` perfectly transmitting ' eigen - wavefronts are the right singular vectors of the modal transmission matrix with singular values ( or transmission coefficients ) close to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if the modal transmission matrix were measured using the techniques described in @xcite , one could compute the pertinent singular vector and synthesize a highly transmitting eigen - wavefront via spatial amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "the task of amplitude and phase modulating an optical wavefront is not , however , trivial .",
    "calibration and alignment issues prevent two independent spatial light modulators in series that separately modulate the signal amplitude and phase .",
    "a viable option is to use the innovative method developed by van putten et al . in @xcite for full spatial phase and amplitude control using a twisted nematic lcd combined with a spatial filter .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we assumed that amplitude and phase modulation was feasible , and developed iterative , physically - realizable algorithms for synthesizing highly transmitting eigen - wavefronts using just a few measurements of the backscatter field .",
    "we showed that the algorithms converge rapidly and achieve @xmath5 transmission using about @xmath6 measurements .",
    "our focus on constructing highly transmitting eigen - wavefronts by using the information in the backscatter field was motivated by , where it is often impossible to measure transmitted fields .",
    "our work will be most helpful in settings where it is desirable to increase the amount of light transmitted through an intervening scattering medium such as in photodynamic therapy where a photosynthesizing agent on exposure to light produces a form of oxygen that can kill neighboring ( cancerous ) cells @xcite .",
    "another promising application is in photoacoustic imaging @xcite which exploits the photoacoustic effect whereby light is converted into heat by absorbing scatterers and the subsequent thermoelasctic expansion produces wideband ultrasonic emissions which can be detected by ultrasonic transducers to form images .",
    "recent breakthrough works have taken this a step further by exploiting the photoacoustic effect to focus light within the medium @xcite .",
    "since the strength of the photoacoustic effect is proportional to the scattered light intensity at the light absorber , one might reasonably expect that algorithms , such as ours , that can increase the amount of transmitted light through a medium can help improve the penetration depth of photoacoustic imaging ( or photoacoustic imaging guided focusing ) by inducing stronger photoacoustic signals from deeper in the medium .    here",
    ", we place ourselves in the setting where we seek to increase transmission via backscatter analysis but are restricted to phase - only modulation .",
    "the phase - only modulation constraint was initially motivated by the simplicity of the resulting experimental setup ( see fig . [",
    "fig : exp setup ] ) and the commercial availability of finely calibrated phase - only spatial light modulators ( slms ) ( e.g. the pluto series from holoeye ) . as we shall shortly see there is another engineering advantage conferred by these methods .",
    "we do not , however , expect to achieve perfect transmission using phase - only modulation as is achievable by amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "however , we theoretically show that we can expect to get at least ( about ) @xmath1 provided that 1 ) the system modal reflection ( or transmission ) matrix is known , 2 ) its right singular vectors obey a maximum entropy principle by being isotropically random , and 3 ) full amplitude and phase modulation permits at least one perfectly transmitting wavefront .",
    "we also develop iterative , physically realizable algorithms for transmission maximization that utilize backscatter analysis to produce a highly transmitting phase - only modulated wavefront in just a few iterations .",
    "these rapidly converging algorithms build on the ideas developed in @xcite by incorporating the phase - only constraint . an additional advantage conferred by these rapidly converging algorithms",
    "is that they might facilitate their use in applications where the duration in which the modal transmission or reflection matrix can be assumed to be constant is relatively small compared to the time it would take to make all measurements needed to estimate the modal transition or reflection matrix or in settings where a near - optimal solution obtained fast is preferable to the optimal solution that takes many more measurements to compute . as in @xcite , the iterative algorithms we have developed retain the feature that they allow the number of modes being controlled via an slm in experiments to be increased without increasing the number of measurements that have to be made .",
    "we numerically analyze the limits of phase - only modulated transmission in 2-d with fully spectrally accurate simulators and provide rigorous numerical evidence confirming our theoretical prediction in random media with periodic boundary conditions that is composed of hundreds of thousands of non - absorbing scatterers .",
    "specifically , we show that the best performing iterative algorithm yields @xmath2 transmission using just @xmath3 measurements in the regime where the non - iterative algorithms yield @xmath4 transmission .    this theoretical prediction brings into sharp focus an engineering advantage to phase - only modulation relative to amplitude and phase modulation that we did not anticipate when we embarked on this line of inquiry .",
    "the clever idea in van putten et al s work was to use spatial filtering to combine four neighboring pixels into one superpixel and then independently modulate the phase and the amplitude of light at each superpixel .",
    "this implies that an slm with @xmath7 pixels can control at most @xmath8 spatial modes .",
    "for a given aperture , combining neighboring pixels into one super pixel corresponds to passing the entire wavefront into a spatial low pass filter .    for highly scattering random media ,",
    "our numerical results in section [ sec : simulations ] , suggest that undersampling the spatial modes by @xmath9 will reduces the average amount of transmission by between @xmath10 . in contrast , our theoretical results in section [ sec : funlimits ] show that controlling all @xmath7 spatial modes using phase - only modulation will reduce the average amount transmission by at most @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we can , on average , achieve higher transmission with phase - only modulation using all the pixels in an slm than by ( integer - valued ) undersampling of the pixels to implement amplitude and phase modulation !",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our setup in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "we discuss the problem of transmission maximization using phase - only modulated wavefronts in section [ sec : prob form ] .",
    "we describe physically realizable , non - iterative and iterative algorithms for transmission maximization in section [ sec : noniterative ] and in section [ sec : algobackmin ] , respectively .",
    "we identify fundamental limits of phase - only modulated transmission in section [ sec : funlimits ] , validate the predictions and the rapid convergence behavior of the iterative algorithms in section [ sec : simulations ] , and summarize our findings in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
